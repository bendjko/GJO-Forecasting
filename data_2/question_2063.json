The average from the data file for prior years is 223k, or about 19k per month. So, a simple exercise of YTD (23,596) plus the average for the remaining five months gets you to 116,590. This seems like the most appropriate starting place. However, a look at the data for 2020 before COVID (through March 15) reveals that near term numbers were already 30% below average. This leads me to wonder if the base rate values are inflated.  Now, we have to consider to factors. First, is there a backlog of evictions that will be filed next month leading to much higher than average values for the rest of the year? Second, will there be political intervention at a city level for the rest of the year? The second question likely has some dependence on the first. For example, a flood of evictions in September would overwhelm the courts and prompt cries for help - thus increasing the odds that another intervention strategy goes into effect. Therefore, I can see a feedback mechanism holding down the probability of greater than normal values.  I'm not convinced that the city would intervene at a rate that will keep numbers at the very low level we have seen so far this year, but I am surprised the crowd has discounted the possibility to zero. I also see no reason to believe that the system will more than double a normal year during the back half of this one. While I understand the potential for a flood of backlogged cases to push us into bin 4, I don't see potential for the year to end up 110% of a normal year.

Figure 2 of this link provided by @jleibowich  is in the ballpark of that as well and provides additional info on the trend [1]. In 2020 there were 74k and year to date in 2021 is at 22k, with a current pace of about 10k every two months which would put it at around 50k at the end of the year if the trend continued. But the eviction moratorium in NY ends August 31. So there is definitely potential for eviction filings to jump up. However, rental relief (which has been slow to get out) is starting to be distributed [2], which I think lowers the potential for evictions somewhat after the moratorium. I'm thinking the low end scenario is one where either the eviction moratorium in New York is extended, or rental relief goes out on time and cuts down the number of evictions after the moratorium ends, either of which could put total eviction filings in 2021 a little above or below 60k. I think the high end scenario is one where evictions jump up to double the 2012-2016 trend after August 31 for the remainder of the year, which would put it around 8,000 evictions per week for about 18 weeks, putting the year end total around 170k. Based on that I'm giving about a 55% chance of evictions staying under 120k for the year. The higher numbers also have larger bucket sizes, so I've given more weight to larger buckets accordingly as well. The CDC eviction moratorium ends July 31 (and also appears to have been struck down in court) so I'll be watching what happens in other states here [3] to see what we might expect in New York after the moratorium expires.

Assuming all of the evictions that didn't happen between March 27, 2020 and now ended up in a backlog, there are currently about 130k pending evictions.

The city needs to help expedite the application process and ease requirements in terms of documentation (other state-funded programs for rent relief last year were said to only have approved 15% of applications, they had to reopen the application period a few months later and review all applications that had been denied. State reps and community orgs said the application was requiring too many documents that were difficult for people to get in the middle of the pandemic). As for pre-pandemic numbers, for comparison, there 230,071 eviction petitions filed by building owners at New York City Housing Court  in 2017.  (Only 9% of them, or 20,804 evictions were executed by the City Marshall). This shows that the city does scramble to solve the issue in court instead of using preventative methods or acting early to assist in cases that may not be complicated or for which there are feasible solutions.  The city has indeed been scrambling since the pandemic and can barely keep up with housing issues. Nonprofit orgs that offer legal assistance are overwhelmed. The mayor's office opened a tenant assistance unit but hard to tell if there is more hiring/expansion of staff there or at nonprofits to help with the volume of cases. \nOne would assume that landlords are more likely to try to work things out if they know the funds are available for them to get paid than spend legal fees. A new mayor and city council won't take office til January 1 so it's somewhat predictable that the Di Blasio admin won't change course under pressure of reelection. Landlords need to get paid and the money is available to help in the overwhelming majority of cases, the issue is how quickly and efficiently can the city manage the backlog. It's getting better but it's still pretty messy.\nAnother note, the relatively low number of filings so far this year may be related to courts being closed, also many people were working from home and everything government related seemed to have been taking 4-6 times as long to get done. \nAlso interesting is the range in numbers in the question, I often find that telling so will for now side with there is a lot of money to fix this problem, it will get expedited and a tsunami of filings greater than the usual for the city will be avoided. The crisis was averted so far...
