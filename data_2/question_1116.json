Since European Parliament Elections will be held on May 26, 2019 in Denmark and the date for general elections needs to be announced three weeks in advance, there's still time until May 5, 2019. If there's no announcement within 4 days (It's not going to be revealed on Tuesday though), then the third option (After 15 May 2019) gets higher probability.

The reason for this is that the absence of any leaked information about the announcement doesn't mean that it won't happen within the time period of option 1. In other words: the announcement procedure doesn't represent a classical observable development. This assumption is backed up through the missing of any significant news coverage in this month which could be used as an indicator to predict the announcement date.  As stated in the last forecast, it is very likely that the announcement will be made in the last April week or the first May weeks in order to combine the Danish election with the EU one.  Furthermore, the (relative) consistent approval ratings for the Venstre and Socialdemokratiet in April back up the assumption that there is no reason for Venstre to delay the announcement beyond the 15th of May as it doesn't seem likely that they will catch up to their competitor by adding two weeks, especially not if this means to organize two elections which bares the risk of being accused to waste state resources.  As a result, this forecast will adjust the likelihood of option 1 to 95% and changes the likelihood of option 2 to 5% accordingly.

The reason why I am forecasting this is because the law of Denmark requires that the elections are announced at least 3 weeks in advance (a very short time for campaigning, in my opinion). I believe that Denmark will hold its general elections on Sunday, the 26th of May, at the same time as the European Parliament election, which means that the elections will have to be announced by Sunday, the 5th of May the latest. \nMy reasoning behind this is twofold, both economic and political. Holding the general election at the same time as the European Parliament elections will benefit Denmark economically as far as the indubitably high costs of elections are concerned. Besides administrative costs, there are the costs of campaigns, expanded media coverage, additional security, and election dispute resolution tools.  Secondly, this would have the effect of increasing voter turnout in particular for the EU elections. In the 2015 Danish general elections, the turnout was 85.89%, nearly 10% above the 77% average in Europe (https://web.archive.org/web/20060314165732/http://www.idea.int/vt/survey/voter_turnout3.cfm), while in the 2014 EU Parliament elections, Denmark's turnout was a modest 53.6%. The interest in national politics would determine an increase in the European vote if both elections take place at the same time.

Looking at the history, we discover that the last time former prime-minister of Denmark Helle Thorning-Schmidt called elections on Tuesday of May 27, 2015, just 3 weeks before actual elections on June 18 of 2015.

Additionally, the election date would likely be set three weeks in advance (see above question). This means that the last theoretical day that it could be announced would be May 28. That gives 13 days for the \"After May 15th\" category for this to happen. As it is currently past April 1st, there is a 0% chance for that category. Lastly, we have the middle category. Unless Denmark announces their elections in the next 45 minutes, there are 35 days where the announcement could happen. There are five weekends in this time frame, so there are 25 days when this could happen on or before May 15th, and 9 days (2 weekends) for after May 15th. That being said, I believe it is also unlikely that the Danish Government would announce elections on a public holiday, and there are 4 holidays occurring on a weekday between now and the time when a date would likely need to be set (April 18, April 19, April 22, and May 17, from https://publicholidays.dk/2019-dates/).

It is very likely that the election will be announced no later than roughly 3 weeks (20 \u2013 22 days) before the election as this is the average time span in regard to the last 3 election announcements in 2015, 2011 and 2007. As a result, it can be assumed that the announcement will be published no later than the 27th of May. Therefore, option 2 consists of (~) 5 weeks in comparison to option 3 which consists of (~) 2 weeks. This fact in itself represent an argument for a higher probability of option 2 over 3. Nonetheless, other aspects of internal and external policy matter, too.   There are 2 main aspects which support a high likelihood for option 2 \u201cBetween 1 April and 15 May 2019\u201d: the simultaneous EU election (from 23th to 26th of May) and the current dissent within the opposition bloc. I agree with several other forecasters that it would make sense for the current ruling party (Venstre) to combine the Danish general election day with the EU parliament election day. The ruling party could benefit and would avoid a negative backlash in the same time. As a pro-EU party, which supports the EU\u2019s basic principles, it could benefit by combining the elections due to the ability to shift the voter focus on EU-related issues. Especially since Brexit, Danes have become more supportive of the EU than the recent years before with an anti-EU peak in 2016 when a majority preferred to leave the EU. In January 2019 62% of surveyed Danes responded that they don\u2019t support a referendum for a Dexit in comparison to 26% of Danes who would vote for leaving the EU. As a result, pro-EU parties gained more support by Danish voters in regard to EU-issues. However, their main competitor (Socialdemokratiet) represents a pro-EU party as well, hence, might also benefit from focusing on EU-related issues. Nonetheless, the Socialdemokratiet hold a more critical position towards the EU. The second argument for Venstre to combine the elections is rooted in avoiding two election days within a short period of time. There are a several aspects to consider. First of all, it should be in Venstre\u2019s interest to keep the organizational efforts as low as possible. Extra costs due to 2 ballots may be seen as a waste of resources and time by voters (this argument could be used by other parties to blame Venstre). Another big aspect is the expected voter fatigue which could cause a negative reputational impact on Venstre, if they ask the Danish constituency to go to elections twice. The third and last argument lies within Venstre\u2019s political stance. As pro-EU party it should be in their interest to support the EU and its popularity whenever possible. Combining the Danish and EU vote would probably result in a higher voter turn-out for the latter one.  Another aspect which increases the probability that Venstre won\u2019t wait to announce the general election is the current split within the opposition bloc. Left-wing parties don\u2019t agree with the anti-immigration stance of the Socialdemokratiet party. Venstre might use this dissent and even increase it by announcing the election as this would result in less time for the opposition to settle their dispute and also would distract them during their election campaigns. To the contrary, the probability of option 3 relies (imo) mainly on the current low voter support for the Venstre party. Indeed, the party has been struggling so far to break the 20% threshold. However, the momentum doesn\u2019t favour Venstre neither. While the party\u2019s support has been declining to 18% after a short uptrend, its main competitor (Socialdemokratiet) managed to gain a \u2018sustainable\u2019 growth which further widened the gap between both frontrunners. It seems that time is working against Venstre. The only reason for the party to delay the election would be to speculate on an increasing dissent within the opposition parties. A risky bet regarding the possible negative impact on Venstre\u2019s reputation addressed above. For the same reputational reasons it also seems unlikely that Venstre will insist on ruling a full parliamentary term.  To conclude, while there are several arguments backing option 2 (longer-time period, EU election & current dissent in opposition) there is almost none (which is reasonable and has a significant impact) backing the option 3 despite a speculative bet on increasing support for Venstre and an increasing dissent. As a result, this forecast assesses that there is a 9 times higher chance that the election will be announced \u201cbetween 1 April and 15 May 2019\u201d than \u201cafter 15 May 2019\u201d. Additionally, it assesses that it is very likely that the announcement will be published in the last April or first May weeks (as this is the time frame for adjusting the Danish election accordingly to the EU one).

With an EU voter turnout of 56% in 2014, this seems unnecessary for Denmark (as it is above EU avarage), however between 80% and 90% vote for the general elections in Denmark. A combination of the two votes might help spike the EU vote. The DPP might not want this, as it is an eurosceptic party currently holding most seats in the EP, but not in the Danish Parliament (elections for which were held a year later).

These three parties have been the three most popular parties in the polls and seem to be in no rush to collapse the current government to expediate the vote in the interest of their campaign.

The forecast at hand assumes a 10% likelihood for an announcement of the election day before 01/04. The last 4 general elections were all announced 20-22 days before the election day (Wikipedia - only English source available). Thus, if announced before 01/04 it would be very likely the elections would take place at the end of April. Not only would Eastern (public holidays: 18/04-18/22) fall into this period, where many Danish people might be on vacation but there would be also a second campaign necessary right in the aftermath due to EU parliament elections between 23/05 - 26/5. This would challenge both financial and human resources for Rasmussen\u2019s  Venstre, and the blue block (as well for all the other parties). From Rasmussen\u2019s perspective, who is responsible for calling out the elections (and thus can use this as a strategic tool) this double load would only make sense if he could secure its majority that way. However, its social democratic opponent Frederiksen is leading the polls at the moment, both in terms of party comparison (Venstre: 17% | Socialdemocrats 25.8%) and block comparison (blue block: 44.4% | red block: 51% (without the party Alternativet, which is also considered a red party)) (http://cphpost.dk/news/election-prospects-look-grim-for-government-in-latest-poll.html). This record low will hardly motivate Rasmussen for an early election move. It is furthermore regarded as rather unlikely by the forecast at hand that this trend will change in this short amount of time - without a drastic external shock. 2. The forecast at hand considers option#2 the most likely, as of 80%. As mentioned in #1 the EP elections will be hold between 23/05-26/05. It seems therefore reasoned to hold both elections on the same day. On the one hand electoral costs, both for the parties and the state could be reduced and on the other hand voter turn out at the EP elections could be increased. Thus, it seems simply as the most practical solution. On top of that, support for Denmark\u2019s EU membership is at a historically high level after the Brexit. While traditionally around 50:50, 66% of the Danish population support the EU membership today (https://www.thelocal.dk/20190104/danish-eu-support-at-record-high-poll). For the pro EU party Venstre this could pose a strategic advantage. While Eurosceptic parties experienced significant losses in polls, Rasmussen could use this trend and campaign with a decisive pro-EU strategy.  3. An announcement of the elections after 15/05 is considered rather unlikely as well, as of 10%. Not only would that mean to hold a second elections right after the EP elections (refer to #1&2) but given current polls that would also mean that Rasmussen would start its campaign with a negative outcome of the EP elections, which would further reduce its chances to win the much more important national elections. Additionally, school holidays in Denmark start on 22/06 (https://www.feiertagskalender.ch/ferien.php?geo=3289&hl=en), thus given the assumed 20-22 days of campaigning period, elections had to be called out between 15/05-01/06, to avoid elections in Danish summer holidays. This means the time period, in #3 is only a third as long as the time period in #2, which decreases the likelihood further."], [67417, "2019-03-05T13:18:58Z", [0.1, 0.75, 0.15], "Firstly, let\u2019s look at the legal temporal limit for the current government in charge to hold the Danish elections. This must be on or before 17 June 2019. If we look at the previous patterns, the last 3 general elections were announced at least 3 weeks before the day of the vote. Furthermore, in the last decade, general elections have all been given a campaign period of around 20 days. Therefore, after this initial brief analysis we can already assess as highly unlikely that the government will announce general elections after the end of May. However, this does not exclude completely none of the given possibilities.  Since Rasmussen, the actual Prime Minister and supported by the so-called \u201cblue block\u201d, has been steadily losing consensus (as it often happens to the government in charge in liberal democracies), it might be in his interests to delay the elections as much as possible in order to give a short amount of time to the opposition to organize an incisive campaign. Therefore, despite the very short period of time (after May 15 but before May 27-28), the last option (after May 15) cannot be excluded completely. I assess it with a 15% chance.  That said, many other factors must be taken into consideration. In particular, the European elections may play a key role in shaping the course of events. EU elections are taking place on Sunday the 26th of May 2019.  In this regard, in order to obtain consistent participation in both the European election and the Danish general elections, the government could opt for holding the general election on the same day as the European ones. It is true that traditionally Danish elections are never on Sundays, however, such an option would also lead to a considerable saving in monetary terms (elections are an expensive practice for countries). Consequently and in base on the consideration given in the first paragraph, Danish general elections could be announced around 20 days before May 26, so at the beginning of that month. Therefore, the second option (Between 1 April and May 15) seems to be by far the most probable outcome. In addition, this one is the longest between the three periods given. For all these reasons, I assess a 75% chance of elections being announced between April 1 and May 15.  Concluding, the first option given (elections announced before April 1) is quite unlikely if we consider that, as stated above, current polls show support for the opposition bloc. It would be against the interest of the government to call for elections now. It is more likely that in the next month Rasmussen will play all his cards to gain more public support and only after that call for new elections. That said, it could be true also the exact contrary. If the government should notice that there is no chance to invert the trend and that by the time it will get only worse, then in this case it might want to hold elections as soon as possible in order to limit the parliament seat loss. For these reasons, neither this option is totally excludable and I assess it with a 10% chance.

Following that, it could be considered that the likelihood that in 2019 the same trend will be followed and the time frame will be similar is high.  \nHowever, this year an additional factor is the EU election. Retrospectively, three times the Danish General Election occurred the same year as the EU election (1979, 1984, 1999) and none of these times, they were held together. Nevertheless, it can be explained by the distance between the elections (national general election were held in September-January while EU elections - in June). What is different, this year, considering the time, general election and EU election happen to be very close to each other. Therefore it can be expected that the decision will be made to arrange general election together with the EU (which is in May23-May26). Hence, it should be announced before the 15 of May.

So assuming 21 days between election call date and election date. This gives 4th May 2019 for the most likely day for elections if the intent was to have them coincide with the European elections (23rd-26th May). Following this logic, the latest date for elections to be called would be 27th May.  Looking at polls (thanks @Chema_Soloregistro for providing this helpful link [2] in https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/825917): There doesn't seem to have been much of a change since the general election of 2015: Venstre, the PM's party, dropped from 20% in the last general election to polling at 18% currently, social democrats are up 1% in polls from their election result, DPP is down 2%. In addition, Venstre is on a downward trend, so they might want to play for time to see if they can turn it around. I think this aspect almost rules out a very early election as implicated in the first bucket. Since there is a European election at around the same time anyway, in my view it would make a lot of sense to have them coincide, so that 1) traditionally high voter turnout in Danish elections could help lift turnout for European elections, 2) to not hold two elections a couple of weeks apart.  Why would Rasmussen delay Danish elections until after the European elections? Maybe he thinks the result of the European election would mobilize Venske voters, or would de-mobilize their opponent's voters. There is very little time between the two elections in any scenario that is not a very early election call, so the campaigns would necessarily overlap and mix. I also see a danger in an election after the European election, in case the euro-sceptic DPP does well on the European level, European topics and euro-scepticism might overpower the Danish issues. All in all I see Danish and EU elections taking place at the same time as the most likely outcome.

The PM has the right to call elections earlier than that date, based on polls. Apparently, back in October it was not doing well in polls [1], but it seems it is recovering from the 17.3% to 18.4%. But another member of the Blue Bloc (supporting the government), the Danish People's Party DPP, drops from 18.2% to 16.2% [2].  Also, as @sreichau mentioned, it has to be considered if the ruling party would be benefited by having both general and EU Parliament elections at the same time. As per Eurobarometer, Denmark is not an eurosceptic country (only 8% want to leave the EU [3]), with only two eurosceptic parties, one of them, moderately, being the DPP. Considering these, the drop in polls for the DPP and shift between this and the ruling party Venstre, joint elections could benefit the latter.   Bottom line, it is unlikely that with current pools the government will call general elections too early.
