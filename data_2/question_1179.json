See here for more info: https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/841007 Other judgments: \n- EWP estimate at 5.0%. [1] \n- Crowd forecast here is 0%. Inside view:\n- there do seem to be recent incidents of violence [2] [3] [4]. However, at most 20 people seem to have been killed. There was some more violence in April,  but nobody was killed [5] \n- political violence seems to be most likely, but it's not clear to me how it would escalate into a mass killing campaign.  Overal judgment: \n- base rate of 2% seems about right.
