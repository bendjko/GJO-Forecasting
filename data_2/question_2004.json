The federal government is not acting, in contrast with last year. State governments are then being left hanging out to dry politically and will be more likely to succumb to pressures to reopen. I wouldn't be surprised if they reopen in patchwork patterns that are not perhaps very correlated with case counts. In about 10 days, India will be at ~28M cases total and ~200k cases/day, with ~66 days left before July 31. They'd have to stay <182k/day average through July 31 to avoid 40M cases by then, and they probably will. (I don't think reaching 40M before July 1 is likely at this point, given lockdowns.) They might get down to ~100k cases/day and park there for a while. If states keep up restrictions, it'll take another ~10 days for cases to fall to ~100k/day, and another ~1.9M cases will be added, so that the total for India will likely be just under 30M around June 6. If the country does bring cases down to 100k/day, then I think 40M would be unlikely by July 31, because that would require >180k cases/day average for the remainder of the period. To get to 40M by August 31 would require 116.3k cases/day, which is certainly more possible. Also, note that respiratory virus infections tend to be more common in the monsoon season, which travels across the country from late May/early June through late September/early October. I don't think it's a coincidence that last year's peak was Sept. 17. I do think it's very likely that 40M cases will be reached by Oct. 1; that would require an average of ~86k cases/day from June 6 through Sept. 30 if cases were brought down to 100k cases/day by June 6. Last year, India was at 50k cases/day and 1.7M cumulative cases on July 31. It took until March 23, 2021 to reach 10M more cases, and there was a far larger susceptible population then. I think that if India forces cases to fall to 50k/day over the coming weeks, then reaching 40M cases will be unlikely before Oct 1. Need to watch and wait to see how far down the country brings cases before lifting restrictions. Summary:\n* With restrictions, India will bring cases down to ~200k/day by May ~27 and total to ~28M; bring cases down to ~100k/day by June ~6 and total to just under 30M by July 31.\n* If cases are brought to 100k/day by June 6, then >180k/day needed to reach 40M by July 31, >116k/day needed to reach 40M by Aug. 31, >86k/day needed by Sept. 30.\n* If cases are brought to 50k/day by June ~17, then India will be at ~31M, and it will be less likely that 40M cases will be reached by Oct. 1.\n* In the absence of restrictions, expect cases to peak during monsoon season, probably around mid-September like last year.

Moreover, restrictions are imposed in many places, but spread in areas outside larger cities is increasing, and such spread will largely go unmeasured and not enter into this forecast. In part because of ongoing spread outside larger cities, as soon as restrictions are lifted, cases will come roaring back. Will the authorities in different places lift restrictions in 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, longer? The federal government imposed extensive restrictions for long durations in 2020, but is there sufficient political will for comparable restrictions now?

A caveat here is that given the logistics in a 1.4 billion people country with a large segment of rural settlements, a lack of medical facilities/medicines  (not to mention a lack of oxygen), databases with the resultant home deaths the numbers are probably underplayed by a significant margin.\nEven so, India is the largest producer of the Oxford-AstraZeneca (Covishield) and BharatBiotech (Covaxin) producing 90 million doses per month that can be used on its citizens rather exporting them which should assist, but logistics remain the issue. https://covid19.healthdata.org/global?view=cumulative-deaths&tab=trend  https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-55571793  https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/health/covid-19-expect-a-million-deaths-in-india-by-august-1-76700  https://www.indiatoday.in/coronavirus-outbreak/story/india-corona-covid-cases-deaths-projection-2021-us-study-peak-may-1794391-2021-04-23  https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/27/india/india-covid-underreporting-intl-hnk-dst/index.html  https://www.livemint.com/news/india/iit-scientists-revise-prediction-on-when-covid-cases-could-peak-in-india-11619437014161.html  https://time.com/6045791/india-covid-forecast/ https://cmg.cds.iisc.ac.in/covid/\nhttps://www.republicworld.com/india-news/general-news/central-panels-projection-for-indias-covid-19-wave-shows-actual-cases-matching-estimates.html https://www.bloombergquint.com/coronavirus-outbreak/india-s-modeling-has-covid-outbreak-peaking-in-coming-days  https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/india/"], [86554, "2021-05-09T11:01:46Z", [0.32, 0.64, 0.04, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [94872, "2021-05-09T03:41:05Z", [0.42, 0.36, 0.14, 0.05, 0.03], ""], [99943, "2021-05-09T03:17:11Z", [0.7, 0.1, 0.05, 0.05, 0.1], ""], [92079, "2021-05-09T01:41:14Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [22689, "2021-05-09T01:38:55Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [35398, "2021-05-08T23:44:26Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [99122, "2021-05-08T21:34:23Z", [0.25, 0.5, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2021-05-08T18:00:48Z", [0.59, 0.4, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2021-05-08T17:57:57Z", [0.57, 0.42, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [86367, "2021-05-08T17:03:44Z", [0.09, 0.38, 0.32, 0.15, 0.06], "Will come back and update later.\nDo keep in mind all major cities are now under lockdown(more states are announcing lockdowns, there are talks of a national lockdown going on.\nAlso while the govt has been painfully slow to respond, they will eventually come up with something better than what they have done in the last month"], [62808, "2021-05-08T16:06:56Z", [0.85, 0.15, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [99943, "2021-05-08T14:25:03Z", [0.6, 0.2, 0.05, 0.05, 0.1], "Revising to later dates; yesterday was the first time the 7-day average didn't increase since the current wave started.

Currently 22% of tests come back positive, suggesting some deceleration of growth may be attributable to limits in testing supply. * At the current rate, will exceed 40m in 48 days, or June 25.\n* Daily cases will have to drop to an average of 342,750 to prolong to July 1.\n* 217,750 for Aug 1\n* 159,550 for Sept 1\n* 126,770 for Oct 1. Current response: No country as poor as India has seen such a dramatic growth in cases per-capita. South Africa is the closest example I can find but they have 3x the per capita GDP.  By varying counts, 11 or 12 of India's 28 (or 29?) states have imposed some kind of lockdown and pressure grows to implement a national one [1]. My current view is that we are nearing the peak of daily new reported cases and confinement measures will continue to be added. Cases will start to come down but nowhere near as rapidly as they rose.

It would mean that the rolling average could only be slightly less than it is now for the next 53 days. As stated by someone below testing is reaching saturation so if the country cannot process anymore tests than it is currently doing then all that is required is for positivity rate to come down from where it is. Prof M Vidyasagar, the government's mathematical modelling expert predicts the 7th of may to be the peak. I know there is some serious differences between the countries (population density, health care, working habits) but if you compare the figures to the US they peaked at a 7 day rolling average of 255000 cases over the next 53 days they added 6.4 million cases. Indias current 7 day average is 390000 if we assume this is as predicted there peak then they would only add 9.79 million cases if they have the same reduction as the US by July 1st. India is the largest producer of Covid vaccines and whilst so far it has exported the majority of what it produces it has now cancelled all exports and is expected to produces 90 million doses in may. They are also going to start importing the Russian sputnik vaccine from June. All vaccines have an efficacy rate above 80%. This may be varied by the different variants and it is well short of the 1.2 billion doses still required but one we get to June we should see these vaccines putting downward pressure on the number of cases. Over the last couple of years the Indian governments have become far less transparent and accountable for their actions. The poor performance of the BJP at recent state elections will likely encourage them to bring down the recorded numbers hopefully legitimately but most likely by manipulating the figures   "], [1624, "2021-05-08T01:25:45Z", [0.4, 0.5, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [99943, "2021-05-07T21:00:10Z", [0.85, 0.15, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "How big is India's epidemic going to get? Cases are still growing, but testing is leveling off and nearing saturation. Overall test positivity rate is 21% for the country, 32% in New Delhi (down from a peak of 36%), and varies across states; it's as high as 62% in Rajasthan, and as low as 5% in Mizoram. Because testing is nearing saturation, it's hard to know what's really going on. There does appear to be an inflection point in the 7day average of cases/day somewhere around April 16 to 21, but it's hard to know whether that's real. Actual cases could be continuing to climb exponentially out of control. Currently, total at 21.49M, with 390k cases/day and still slightly climbing. Obviously, most cases are being missed, but confirmed cases still give us a useful measure of the size of the problem. In the press, I see speculation that cases in New Delhi and Maharashtra will likely peak in May, other places in June. I'm not sure I see why they should peak in May.\nAnyway, 18.51M to go to get to 40M. 55 days left before July 1; would require 337k cases/day to reach 40M by July 1. On April 6, there were 93k cases/day (7day average), so things can go up and down very quickly. I suspect we have weeks more to go, though, before the epidemic in India truly turns around. If one estimates that India is underestimating deaths by ~10x, then they have reached about as many deaths as a proportion of the population as the US has. But they don't have nearly enough vaccinations or control measures to slow this down yet.\nI think India will easily reach 30M cases by July 1. If the epidemic peaks in the next couple weeks or so, then 40M cases may not be reached by July 1. But if it peaks around June 1 or after, then I think 40M is assured, unless they run out of testing supplies. I think the peak of the epidemic for the country as a whole may not be reached until sometime in June. On the other hand, areas outside major cities may have limited testing capabilities, so the true peak may not show up in the testing data. Still, I think it's very likely that India will reach 40M cases before July 1.\nhttps://time.com/6045791/india-covid-forecast"], [85522, "2021-05-07T20:48:12Z", [0.0, 0.11, 0.16, 0.23, 0.5], "To rise from 21.5m on 7 May to 40m by 1 July would mean a daily average of 330,000.\nFrom 7 May to 1 August = 210,000\nFrom 7 May to 1 Sept = 158,000\nFrom 7 May to 1 Oct = 125,000 I don't think India will see 40m confirmed cases in this wave, according to the current system of counting which uses testing. It may well be that the total number of untested cases is already beyond 40m. But to reach 40m before 1 July would mean spreading at a rate almost as high as currently for 55 days, and the current increase in cases is slowing down.
