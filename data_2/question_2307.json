That will no doubt have upward pressure on this market. However, near enough the same hawkishness was signalled at the start of the yea, and between 23rd December and 10th February (a 7 week period) the rate only just increased enough to resolve this as yes. I think most of this is already priced in. So I'm going with a low likelihood.

Recently the 10 year yield has reclaimed to 2% mark and is making a surge to the upside (Sitting near ~2.25% as of writing this forecast).
