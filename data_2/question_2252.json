Base rate: 4 lockouts in MLB history and the current is the first since 1990. Nine (9) total work stoppages with varying degrees of impact on spring training, start dates, and games missed. \n2021 lockout:  61 days, TBD\n1990 lockout: 32 days, opening day pushed one week, no games missed\n1976 lockout: 17 days, no games missed\n1973 lockout: 18 days, spring training delayed, no games missed Base rate is that 1 in 3 complete lockouts resulted in a delayed start to the season = 33%.  I support the sentiment that MLBPA has learned from the 2020 / 2021 seasons the impact of delayed starts WRT injury, and will - regardless of the timing of an agreement - seek to preserve a three or four week spring training for the health of their players.  ESPN: \"Injuries were a season-long issue when the start of spring training was altered by the pandemic in 2020 and 2021, and it will again be a concern if camps open late.\" \"During the restart to the pandemic season in 2020, the 23 days between the start of summer camp (July 1) and Opening Day (July 24) wasn't enough time to get ready, at least according to many pitchers and their agents. In order to begin the 2022 regular season on time, and with less concern for injury, four weeks of spring are likely needed, according to league sources. That means camps need to open by March 3, approximately. It doesn't mean the sides can't agree on a shorter spring -- just like they did two years ago -- to keep Opening Day on March 31, it's just not ideal.\"\nhttps://www.espn.co.uk/mlb/story/_/id/33167564/nearly-two-months-mlb-lockout-to-worry-spring-training-opening-day As of January 25th it is reported the talks are \"progressing\" with both sides making concessions and opening inroads to a deal - but this could be misplaced optimism based on the source. \nhttps://www.mlb.com/news/mlb-mlbpa-cba-talks-progressing On the other hand, many other sources seem to be taking a more pessimistic view of the negotiations - seemingly prepared for a delayed start if no agreement is made by February 1st.....so the next 25 hours. \nhttps://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/each-mlb-teams-top-prospect-in-2022-royals-bobby-witt-jr-mariners-julio-rodriguez-more/ On that third hand that I own, I think there is an innate desire for the stewards of \"America's National Past-time\" to ensure that a 2022 season occurs, particularly because of the hardships experienced through two prior years of pandemic related hardship. That sentiment puts me at 50-50, beyond the base rate.  A more aligned message between MLB and external sports reporting sources will push me further toward a higher probability that the season will start - as planned - on March 31st.
