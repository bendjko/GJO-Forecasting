US milk production was on record level in March 2021, however, the US are a minor player in the world's W.M.P. trade (6,000 tons only). Most activity is a regional trade between NZ (exported 297,000 tons W.M.P. in Jan-Feb 2021, up 5% from a year ago) and China (imported 242,000 tons between Jan-Feb 2021, up 9% from 222,000 tons a year ago). It is interesting to see that China crowded out almost the entire rest of the market from W.M.P. imports, since the amounts of other main importers (JP, RU, US, UK, AUS) fell drastically to a combined total of 12,000 tons.\nChina even increasingly dominated the imports of Skim Milk Powder (S.M.P.) as a substitute,  but price increases there seem to have been limited, as increased demand could be matched with increased supply from Australia and the US.\nOther main importing nations such as Oman, which absorbed 11,067 tons of W.M.P. in Jan-Feb 2021 (up 38% yoy) and thus almost a quarter of the EU's trade volume, have added to the bottleneck.\nThe regional character of the shortage and price jumps shows up in the premium the latest auctions prices reflect for the region \"Oceania\" of up to 10% (slide 6: W.M.P. EU: 3,848 OC: 4,150 US: 3,891)\nThe relatively stable price for raw milk (over regions, over seasons, over years) and slightly lower trend (versus 2019), and stable production cost (feed cost: up; energy cost: down) shows the phenomenon is mostly limited to the niche of milk powder (W.M.P. and, to a lesser extent S.M.P.) and other durable dairy goods with a long shelf life such as cheese or butter. Arbitrage, which means a riskless interregional trade of the missing amounts triggered by the price gap, is limited due to high freight cost and the delays in market information, which causes a time lag between contracting and physical delivery of up to six weeks, I assume. \nNevertheless, the EU as the worlds largest milk producing economy (roughly between 11mn and 13mn tons of raw milk p.a. collected) will have an incentive to ship more W.M.P. in store to Oceania from the beginning of March 2021, which should dampen further price increases there.\nHowever, there are two main caveats: 1) feed cost are certainly set to increase further in the wake of rising grain prices (which would add to the price of raw milk and thus to the total production cost of W.M.P.) and 2) W.M.P. appears to be a niche product in the EU which means that production capacity could be at a very limited scope compared to the demand/supply situation. In the seasonal cycle, the EU raw milk  production will have reached its peak in May and June, so if the surpluses there are diverted to a sufficiently large W.M.P. production and charges are then sold and shipped to the Oceania region over the next two biweekly auctions, the global demand could be met at lower auction prices and the price could come out at just below 4,000 USD/MT or even lower on 15 June 2021. Last not least, the exchange rates will have a slight impact on trade flows: a weaker US Dollar would lessen the margin for EU exporters in the USD-denominated trade (internal market price: 3,200EUR per MT (as of 16 May 2021; https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/food-farming-fisheries/farming/documents/eu-dairy-commodity-prices_en.pdf slide 5; at a current exchange rate of 1.2187 USD per EUR, this means 3,900USD/MT, a further slide in USD would raise the internal market price in USD terms and thus narrow the margin), and thus probably increase Oceania regions prices further, as freight cost on top of the EU's spot price would increase the USD price at which EU exporters would put their amounts on offer. https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/food-farming-fisheries/farming/documents/dashboard-dairy_en.pdf EDIT:\nhttp://www.fao.org/economic/est/est-commodities/dairy/en/ Counterintuitively, the June trading event's weighted average index price could depend less on spot prices but crucially on offered amounts and settlement prices for August 21 (currently \"Contract +3\") and September 21 (currently \"Contract +4\"), since offered amounts (and thus the weight within the index) are likely to increase as these contracts come closer to maturity, and these are the two contracts that saw the largest price hikes in the latest auction as of 18 May 2021 with 4,198USD/MT (C+3; +0.4%) and 4,205USD/MT (C+4; +0.6%), while particularly July 2021/C+2 (which should currently have the largest weight) fell by 0.2% to 4,110USD/MT.\nIt thus appears that China is currently stockpiling specific dairy products, probably not only due to acute demand, but also in anticipation of delays in shipment (as the FAO suspects), in anticipation of disruptions that a possible acceleration of a second SARS-CoV-2 wave could cause (when international trade could come to a temporary halt again), and possibly also in anticipation of sanctions imposed by important trade partners such as the EU, if the political climate between China and \"the West\" is further deteriorating. With dairy products, China is exhibiting a very rare and large dependency on imports, an exposure to political goodwill and a vulnerability with respect to effects on the domestic situation (a shortage of W.M.P. would certainly cause disgruntlement among Chinese citizens and add to domestic food price inflation).\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/food-farming-fisheries/farming/documents/world-gdt-auction-results_en.pdf (slide 1) EDIT2:\nA true picture of EU's W.M.P. production is impossible to retrieve or forecast, since among major producers only Belgium, Denmark, France, Ireland and Sweden disclose annual produced amounts, other major producers such as Germany have flagged amounts as \"confidential\" since at least 2011, which means that reports remain incomplete."], [22689, "2021-05-21T18:51:22Z", [0.6], ""], [13657, "2021-05-21T18:45:20Z", [0.9], ""], [100273, "2021-05-21T18:36:43Z", [0.9], "Seasonal trends and inflation.
