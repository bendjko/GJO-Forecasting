The deferral by a powerful U.N. committee effectively denied, for now and possibly through much of 2022, attempts by the ruling authorities of Afghanistan and Myanmar, which are widely considered pariahs, to occupy seats at the United Nations. The nine-nation Credentials Committee of the General Assembly, which is responsible for approving the diplomatic representation of each U.N. member state, held a closed meeting on the applications by the Taliban and Myanmar junta to replace the ambassadors of the governments they had deposed. Afterward, the committee\u2019s chairwoman, Ambassador Anna Karin Enestr\u00f6m of Sweden, told reporters that the panel \u201cdefers its decision of the credentials in these two situations.\u201d\n. . . \nDiplomats said the committee would make the deferral recommendation in a report to be submitted to the General Assembly next week. That could mean the question of who represents both Afghanistan and Myanmar at the United Nations may not be resolved before the next annual General Assembly gathering in September 2022. @Khalid, @GMR, @jleibowich, @ctsats, @probahilliby, @DippySkippy, @Raisinville Additional edits to correct user names:  sorry!"], [27321, "2021-09-28T16:37:41Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [65446, "2021-09-28T16:30:27Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [94737, "2021-09-28T15:10:03Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [68, "2021-09-28T15:07:20Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [57249, "2021-09-28T14:35:50Z", [0.07, 0.93, 0.0], ""], [102439, "2021-09-28T13:25:11Z", [0.05, 0.81, 0.14], ""], [74903, "2021-09-28T13:23:50Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [101355, "2021-09-28T13:03:48Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [101223, "2021-09-28T13:03:38Z", [0.01, 0.99, 0.0], ""], [101355, "2021-09-28T13:03:15Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [20156, "2021-09-28T07:08:26Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [83, "2021-09-28T01:46:05Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [98424, "2021-09-27T23:48:53Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [62808, "2021-09-27T22:54:55Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [100701, "2021-09-27T18:36:25Z", [0.02, 0.0, 0.98], ""], [101031, "2021-09-27T18:30:39Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [94872, "2021-09-27T16:20:59Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [1056, "2021-09-27T15:12:38Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [81456, "2021-09-27T13:51:18Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], "Afghan representative will not address the GA General Debate on Monday, as initially scheduled; Afghanistan has been removed from the schedule for Monday, Sep 27 (https://www.un.org/en/ga/info/meetings/76schedule.shtml), confirming earlier journalistic reports (https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/afghanistan-myanmar-will-not-address-un-general-assembly-says-official/article36696602.ece , https://tass.com/world/1342987).

We should remember that \"shame\" and \"humiliation\" are particularly meaningful words in the Pashtun psyche and something they will be very keenly conscious of at this fragile, embryonic moment in their tenure. The only credible reason to submit ASAP would be to try and unseat the previous administration's incumbent (who is very likely to not speak kindly of the Taliban government at the UN).  However, as has been explored through historical precedent, a rushed submission of competing credentials is in no way a guaranteed route for the Taliban to unseat (and therefore silence) Isaczai.  They failed to achieve this same goal between 1996 - 2001 through the same method and as the personalities who submitted then are very much the same who'll probably be submitting now one wonders why they would bother with this likely fruitless endeavour as an expedited priority? I believe it much more likely that, at least in the near term, the Taliban will be content with having their position represented / reinforced (and the old administration's representative undermined) through their proxies, friends and allies in the UNGA (China, Pakistan and probably Russia on specific issues).  Afghanistan's neighbours can represent the need for international support, rebuilding, development and humanitarian aid across their shared borders without the Taliban having to debase themselves in asking for it directly. This strategy within the UNGA would appear to work more in their favour (certainly in the immediate term, whilst they establish themselves fully and whilst the dust settles from their rise to power) without handing the wider international community an opportunity to publicly condemn and reject their existence (whilst also sullenly accepting it as a fait accompli) via a rejection or deferment of their delegations credentials.

It would be quite \"on trend\" for the Taliban to submit late but still expect to be considered (as they appeared to do in October of '96) and this article does a very good job of identifying the different conditions in play that may encourage them to try their hand this time. Importantly, I think this article helps cut this question down from 3 possible forecasting \"buckets\" to 2. They may not submit credentials within this month (Bucket 3 still in play) or they may still submit credentials (late) for consideration (Buckets 1 and 2).

While the Committee recommended that Cambodia's seat remain empty, it deferred a decision about the Afghanistan dispute, but allowed the prior representative to retain Afghanistan's seat until the issue was decided. See Report of the Credentials Comm., supra note 319, H 9-10.) This potentially supports @GMR's posit (that the Taliban will want to submit credentials ASAP in order to try and displace the current incumbent) with some relevant historical precedent. With this precedent set its worth remembering that the Taliban submitted competing credentials from 1997 to 2001 (when they were deposed) and were rejected every year by the UNGA: they failed to displace the previous representative with this tactic. As such, are they likely to want an immediate return to this game of application and rejection, knowing it will very likely fail anyway and the same guy will remain in post at the UN? Will they view this as a foregone conclusion and therefore won't bother as a priority for this month?

In this situation, the UNGA declined to reward a persistent and gross violator of human rights for its violent take-over of State institutions. The UNGA accepted this recommendation each year until the Taliban was deposed in 2001.

Were they to submit credentials in such a rush (and to the UN's timeframe rather than their own) they might also worry about the optics of such haste: that it might be perceived as a desperate \"need\" for the outside world's recognition in order for them to legitimately govern. The Taliban are, if nothing else, aggressively proud of their self stylised independence, resilience and ability to survive in the face of the entire world's might (whilst quietly ignoring that they've been hiding under a nuclear power's skirts and borrowing their lunches for the last two decades!).

So I think a sub-question is: \"Is there a chance of success?\" It comes down to the nine-member Credentials Committee and General Assembly (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Credentials_Committee). The US, China and Russia are always members of the Credentials Committee. Possible views:\n- USA: I imagine the US made a deal with the Taliban to facilitate the evacuations from Kabul. What leverage would the US have with the Taliban while surrounded in a highly vulnerable position at the airport? Either the $$ frozen in bank accounts, or perhaps international recognition. The US has been negotiating with the Taliban for a while in the lead up to the withdrawal, obviously had established trust on the ground during the evacuations, and has already said they will open representational offices in Doha. So, a US abstention (at a minimum) is possible, but I doubt the US would diplomatically lobby other members on the Taliban's behalf (its \"too soon\" after such a collectively traumatizing experience).\n- The Russian Embassy in Kabul met with a Taliban delegations very quickly after Kabul first fell.\n- The Chinese have been meeting with Taliban leadership. Given the natural resources in Afghanistan they covet, they could be a potential lobbyist. We do not know the other members of the Committee.

This leads me to a lot of uncertainty, pushing me toward a neutral forecast.  https://www.csmonitor.com/2000/0926/p7s1.html"], [96757, "2021-09-01T11:32:08Z", [0.08, 0.32, 0.6], ""], [101256, "2021-09-01T09:46:54Z", [0.01, 0.26, 0.73], ""], [89050, "2021-09-01T08:37:19Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.9], ""], [97012, "2021-09-01T08:09:24Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [96367, "2021-09-01T07:57:16Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.85], "@cfs_sniper lays out a particularly compelling argument (the embarrassment of being rejected and therefore waiting until they have more tacit support or legitimised standing) and a useful analysis of the potential voting blocks in play (https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1327667). I share his scepticism on the likelihood of the Taliban making this a priority in the next month (or even being able to organise themselves to put a delegation forward in this short a time with everything else going on).  I also ask myself \"is this really a priority for them?\" given that they will at this moment be getting more direct support from China and Pakistan (who's patronage I'd guess they are far more likely to be interested in right now). One wonders what they would be looking forward to if they did attend?  Do they really expect the world powers to suddenly welcome them with open arms, or would their delegation be subjected to a non-stop barrage of criticism, opining on the stripping back of human rights and widespread condemnation of their violent rise to power?  Certainly some voices (China and possibly Russia) would likely be taking more mollified positions but those conversations have been going on outside the UNGA anyway.  Would the new Taliban government really want to offer the broader world powers they reject and have, in many cases, fought for the last two decades an open chance to use them as the 76th GA's political pi\u00f1ata? They will likely have the local support they most need at this moment from China and Pakistan and by maintaining (tacit) open lines of communication to aid and HR agencies they will have access to some funding, logistics and expertise support whilst they try to rebuild a more stable infrastructure. The there's the addition matter of security clearances and approvals for the individuals in the delegation to travel (to New York!!) in the first place.  Many of the characters likely to be sent to the UNGA are also likely to be on several watch and no fly lists making the physical logistics of sending a delegation of Taliban favoured representatives challenging. I expect that the UNGA will continue employing virtual platforms whilst COVID 19 is still marching around the world (https://www.un.org/en/ga/) which mitigates some of the issues involved in travel for recently censured terrorists, but the lack of a physical presence on the floor of the GA also makes any imperative to do this for \"the visuals\" even less pressing (or impressive)."], [94872, "2021-09-01T05:52:34Z", [0.11, 0.36, 0.53], ""], [5181, "2021-09-01T02:48:18Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], "Taliban is not democratically elected and  recognition of their credentials would defy the spirit of rightful legitimacy.

They could have made a statement by attacking Western interests directly, but they very clearly stuck to some sort of deal instead, and kept out of the way of evacuations. I think they will try, but the question is whether they will try by October 2, 2021 and the outcome. Like any government, I think they will make the move when they think they have a chance of success (as otherwise its an international embarrassment, and they're behaving like they care what other countries think). So I think a sub-question is: \"Is there a chance of success?\" [EDIT SEPT 1: The below is based on an incorrect understanding of the procedural rules, which @ctsats pointed out. I recommend everything below this line be disregarded, though I keep it here instead of deleting it in case others, who previously read my analysis, wonder what happened to it.] Admission of new members to the UN requires Security Council recommendation and a 2/3rds vote of the General Assembly (https://www.un.org/en/ga/about/ropga/adms.shtml). So, what the Security Council thinks is important, but I'll get to that in a second. To submit credentials, they would need to make an official submission of some type, which would involve the Afghan Foreign Ministry to some degree, as well as appointing a representative. So, to a degree, they need to reconstitute some of the diplomatic arm of the Afghan government, which takes time. Part of this is getting into New York, part into other countries they need to lobby, and part is getting their civil servants back to work (which could be hindered by financial crunches). Possible Security Council Views:\n- USA: I imagine the US made a deal with the Taliban to facilitate the evacuations from Kabul. What leverage would the US have with the Taliban while surrounded in a highly vulnerable position at the airport? Either the $$ frozen in bank accounts, or perhaps international recognition. The US has been negotiating with the Taliban for a while in the lead up to the withdrawal, obviously had established trust on the ground during the evacuations, and has already said they will open representational offices in Doha. So, a US abstention (at a minimum) is possible, but I doubt the US would diplomatically lobby other members on the Taliban's behalf.\n- The Russian Embassy in Kabul met with a Taliban delegations very quickly after Kabul first fell.\n- The Chinese have been meeting with Taliban leadership. Given the natural resources in Afghanistan they covet, they could be a potential lobbyist.\n- The UK will likely have piggy-backed on US deal-making for facilitating its evacuations. However, the British PM laid out pre-conditions including education of girls up to age 18, which may not be the direction the Taliban take.\n- France may align a little more closely with EU policy, which laid out a set of preconditions before they'd recognize the Taliban.\n- Norway/Estonia: Likely to follow US lead.\n- India: Likely to be an obstacle to anything which increases Pakistan's influence.\n- Niger, Kenya: May support Chinese position, given Chinese influence in Africa.\n- Vietnam: Unlikely to support Chinese position.\n- Tunisia: Unlikely to support anything which increases domestic terrorism risk.\n- Mexico, Ireland: Unknown. I think there are multiple obstacles and the chance of success is low, so they won't try, yet. If I'm wrong, and they do try, they won't succeed, yet.

For example, politicians from Canada consider talibans as a terrorist group. Every country involve in the last episode of the airport evacuation need some time to reframe their mind, and their constituants;\n2- Feminist group inside some occidental countries have a lot of influence. There are election in Germany and Canada... fearing of feminist reaction in regard of taliban toward women rights can be a political instinct;\n3- Dissensions in the country will happen sooner or later... probably before october 2. So what we see now like an unified country will not be the same in some days. Ethnic, regional power, religious group... old lord of war will soon arise against Taliban, The actual perception of unity will soon disapear and will be reason or interest to not recognize this country;\n4- Maybe Taliban wont be enough organize to submit their credentials. I am not taking for a certitude that a well and organized government can be able to take in charge this country... and make the decision to submit credentials.

I think overall the world has more interest in stability in Afghanistan than a break up.  I think that US is a puppeteer in  rapid rise of Taliban, for example pulling funds from Kabul Gov.  My intuition is that if the Taliban are successful at  human rights and form a somewhat inclusive gov, the US will be an unofficial sponsor.  I think that China and Russia also have an interest in Terror free Afghanistan.  India may still be threatened by a unified Afghanistan. Some things to keep an eye on:\nSponsors are important to who votes\nHow well the Taliban do on human rights\nHow successful the Taliban are at making Afghanistan inclusive via traditional Islamic Democratic methods.\nEdit per GMR: Afghanistan is already a permanent member so all they need is a up vote from UN assembly.\nAlso: General Assembly meets annually in a regular session that opens on the third Tuesday of September so 2 Oct is possible."], [1333, "2021-08-27T17:51:32Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""]], "open_date": "2021-08-27T17:00:39Z", "close_date": "2021-10-02T07:01:39Z"}
