S&P has rated Bolivia 14 times since 2011 and has downgraded Bolivia 5 times according to https://countryeconomy.com/ratings/bolivia.  As a result, I\u2019m establishing the base rate at 20% (avg of Moody\u2019s and S&P). According to the Center for Financial Studies, sovereign rating downgrades are considered to be indications of a crisis and are based on two components: economic risk and political risk.  Moody\u2019s and S&P generally look at eight categories: risk, income and economic structure, economic growth prospects, fiscal flexibility, public debt burden, price stability, balance of payments flexibility, and external debt and liquidity.  The factors are used to determine whether a country is willing or able to pay its debts. Based on two articles from the Economist (https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2019/01/19/the-movement-to-stop-bolivias-president-evo-morales and https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2020/01/23/the-current-calm-in-bolivia-is-fragile), Bolivia\u2019s economy has grown ~5% per year during Evo Morales\u2019 roughly 13 years in power, which is double the Latin American average. While Bolivia is still South America\u2019s poorest country, extreme poverty has been cut in half. The current crisis appears to be primarily due to political risk, not necessarily economic.  After Evo Morales tried to rig the election in Oct \u201919 and subsequently fled to Mexico, Jeanine \u00c1\u00f1ez, the senate\u2019s second vice-president, and Eva Copa, a senator at the head of the legislature, are leading the government.  Their priority has been to stabilize political violence in the country for the upcoming election on 3 May.  Due to previous election issues, a new electoral tribunal will oversee the upcoming elections, and international observers and updated software will be used as well.  While these efforts may not work, Moody\u2019s and S&P will most likely not rush to a credit rating decision.   It looks like Moody\u2019s and S&P typically take 6+ months before making a determination, which would be Summer 2020.  Additionally, most of Moody\u2019s and S&P\u2019s ratings appear to occur either in the Winter (Nov/Dec) or Summer (May-July).  As a result, it would be consistent with previous rating timelines for the next update to come out after the 3 May election.  As a result, I\u2019m decreasing my forecast from the above base rate to 15%.  If political violence gets worse or if Bolivia becomes insolvent, I will increase my forecast.  If not, I will continue to lower it.

Some quick research suggests that most of Bolivia's macro data is released quarterly (https://www.economy.com/bolivia/real-gross-domestic-product) which means there are only a few releases until this question resolves. On the other hand, the situation in Bolivia appears to be in flux. The care-taker government is pro-privatization which could reduce income for debt-service payments. I also liked @cafebedouin research that shows Moody's is more aggressive than what my research on S&P showed. So this raises the question of \"well, what is Moody's saying?\" (https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-places-Bolivias-Ba3-rating-under-review-for-downgrade--PR_403833) Looks like Moody's is emphasizing political turmoil and the policies of the new administration. But this line stood out to me \"The review may extend beyond the usual three-month horizon as a longer time period may be required by the new government to define its policy agenda following another round of presidential elections.\" suggesting that Moody's is taking a wait and see approach.  Looking at the macro-indicators, real GDP seems to be on a downtrend, the current account deficit is expected to increase, foreign currency reserves are declining, and foreign currency denominated debt is expected to grow. All of these factors would support a downgrade, but these trends are nothing new and likely baked into the current outlook. All of this suggests that a) S&P is unlikely to issue a downgrade soon, the economic/political situation in Bolivia is deteriorating, b) Moody's is likely to issue a downgrade but is going to be patient and wait to assess the current government's policies. With macro data likely to be released once (maybe twice) before this question closes, I see less risk in Moody's changing their mind.
