The last major update was the expiration of the government buy-back program, which the NZ government claimed was a success but the opposition claimed was a failure.

According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overview_of_gun_laws_by_nation, of the 116 countries they list about 87% (I may have counted slightly off) have full gun registries (like the one proposed), a couple have no registry, and the remainder have registries dependent on type of gun, region, etc. However, it's not clear whether the remainder of countries not listed (primarily African, Central Asian, and some Central and South American) mostly do or do not have registries, so it's a slightly flawed starting place. So I'll un-extremize this base rate a bit to account for that uncertainty, and say perhaps 80% of total countries have similar registries, which would be the base rate if 50% of the unaccounted for countries had gun registries (if I had more time I could do this properly).  Next I think about what it would take for this to happen in New Zealand by that date.\n1. Is it possible for it to be passed by that date?\nIt seems like yes. This bill is currently in the Select Committee, whose report is due February 10. The House sitting calendar shows 12 sitting days prior to March 15 (all after Feb 10), which technically is enough for this bill to make it through the required process. According to @vaska, \"The range on how quickly (the next three stages) occurs seems to vary widely, from 1 day to over 1 year: https://www.parliament.nz/resource/en-NZ/00HOOOCProgressLegislation1/0c2019cc2c015b9752db459669c26a5dfecaa84e&quot; 2. Is it likely to get the necessary votes?\nThe bill needs a majority of the 120 MP votes. Keeping in mind that the bill has already survived a first reading vote to advance it to the committee. An area of future research for me is how indicative this is of final support. Do MPs regularly vote through bills at an early stage they later vote against? \nThe current political party positions are as such:\na.\tAct Party- 1 member. Opposes registry. \nb.\tLabor Party- 46 members (in Coalition). The Government (led by Arden, a Labor politician) introduced the bill, so while I couldn't find a party position supporting it, it seems likely that they would. \nc.\tGreens- 8 members (in Coalition). Party position is to support registry. \nd.\tNZ First- 9 members (in Coalition). Unclear. Wikipedia says party position does not support reintroduction of registry, but that is uncited and according to news article (https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12277943) they haven\u2019t decided what they are doing yet. \ne.\tNational Party- 55 members (in Opposition). Opposes the bill but has made recommended amendments. I need to do more research on what these changes would be and the likelihood of success.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_law_in_New_Zealand#Positions_of_political_parties\nhttps://www.stuff.co.nz/national/116470813/national-is-opposed-to-firearms-bill-after-most-changes-it-requested-are-declined?fbclid=IwAR3vRTZASWui0_jXWl7c48fIZSDOcl2khULCbjDl3CoEmMg8XsLea2EZIoU\nSo if all Coalition MPs vote for this bill, it will pass. That seems to hinge on NZ First, individual MPs, and also whether any National support can be negotiated. There was near unanimous support for the last gun reform legislation, which also seems to nudge in a positive direction. However, that was also among the momentum of the recent memory of the shooting.  3. Which bill could it be? \nThe obvious answer is the Arms bill, but could the gun registry specifically be removed from that bill with the bill still passing by 15 March? Is it possible that a new, separate bill just addressing a gun registry will be introduced and passed before then? The latter seems unlikely but I haven't done adequate research on the former.  SO in trying to put this all together into a probability, I intuitively know I want to wind up above 50%. If I start with my base rate of 80%, I am going +5% for the fact that it is possible for this bill to pass in the available time. I am going to adjust downward significantly because of the legislative uncertainty. Which way will NZ First go? How hard is the Opposition line? Are there individual MPs that might break in either direction? Some of these questions can be resolved when I have time for more research, while others will need to be updated with time. I also want to know more about public opinion. Will there be a supportive tide as the one year anniversary of the shooting nears? Are the minority small but vocal? I need more news articles to determine these things, which don't currently exist and will influence the factors described in the sentence prior. -20% for that (an intuitive guess). Which leaves me at 65%.  Other questions:\n1. What is the history of gun registry legislation in NZ? Has it been introduced and not passed many times before?\n2. There really hasn't been a lot of recent news coming out on this. Once Parliament is back in session in February I think that might change so I will keep an eye out.

NZ legislators might see this date as symbolically important, and push to pass the Arms Bill before then. However, as far as I can tell the March 15th, 2020 cutoff is arbitrarily specified by this question. I have not seen any articles in which NZ MPs reference anything about hoping to pass this bill before the 1 year anniversary of the shooting. So I am unconvinced of the importance of this deadline - unless I am missing something?\n- Bills in NZ can pass very quickly at times. The last set of gun control measures (linked in the description to this question) passed Parliament only 26 days after the Christchurch shooting. Reasons against:\n- It seems like political momentum for gun control measures in NZ is beginning to wane in comparison to the immediate aftermath of the Christchurch shooting. Opposition parties like the ACT, as well as gun owners' orgs, are putting up some resistance. They are also beginning to criticize the first round of gun control legislation from last April as a failure:\n     - https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/after-mosque-attacks-new-zealands-gun-buyback-runs-into-an-obstacle-gun-owners/2019/12/20/b4071106-208f-11ea-b034-de7dc2b5199b_story.html\n     - https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/20/questions-raised-about-new-zealands-gun-buyback-scheme-as-amnesty-ends\n     - https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/20/world/australia/new-zealand-gun-ban.html\n- The Arms Bill's status (https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/BILL_91272/arms-legislation-bill) is currently listed as \"Report Due: 10 Feb 2020\". I'm not totally sure what this means - but it seems like the bill probably won't leave the Select Committee until this occurs? So, after 2/10 that leaves Parliament less than 5 weeks to get the bill through the Second Reading, Whole House Committee, and Third Reading. The range on how quickly this occurs seems to vary widely, from 1 day to over 1 year: https://www.parliament.nz/resource/en-NZ/00HOOOCProgressLegislation1/0c2019cc2c015b9752db459669c26a5dfecaa84e. Again, an empirical base rate calculation would be useful here. Overall, I'm going with more likely than not that the legislation remains in the NZ parliament having not yet passed by March 15th. Off the top of my head, some factors that might make me change my mind:\n- News articles which indicate the bill is gaining momentum (I have not found any such articles since the bill was first introduced in September)\n- Articles that indicate NZ legislators are taking the symbolic value of March 15th, 2020 seriously and intend to push the bill through Parliament before then\n- Base rate data which indicates that a majority of NZ parliamentary bills pass from the Select Committee to Royal Assent within 2 months\n- I learn that the Prime Minister's coalition in support of this legislation is stronger than I thought, and that the bill can pass despite any resistance from ACT or other opposition groups"], [81388, "2020-01-15T17:27:39Z", [0.3], "The report from the Select Committee isn't due until February 10th.  I'm not exactly sure what we're defining as parliament passing this bill (i.e. is it the Royal Assent or just the passage after the Third Reading in the bill process?) Royal Assent can take more time. Assuming it's the passage of the bill by Parliament after the Third Reading, I still don't think there's enough time to get this bill passed by March 15th. If the report from the SC is on time on Februarty 10th (which based on my initial look at the bills that have been recently passed is almost always at least a month behind the the \"submission due date\" - again, not exactly sure what this means and i could be very wrong about this. but i believe it means when the report is due back from the SC step of the process), we would then go to the Second Reading which takes some time (the fastest i've seen is a week in my initial look at the current legislation schedule and previous bills that have been passed) which then goes to a Committee of the whole house and then a third reading which would all have to happen in 3.5 weeks. I want to scrape the data from the Parliament site and calculate actual quantitative baserates on this information, instead of making calls based on my initial scans of the data.

New Zealand's parliamentary seats, parties, coalitions, and election cycle.\n4.

I found an article that suggests this possibility.  https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/116047692/aim-for-gun-reform-to-be-law-by-first-anniversary-of-christchurch-shooting\n1. b) The National Party has about a dozen proposed amendments to the bill.

(Note that I am NOT looking at bills that FAILED to pass, so this search has Survivorship Bias.) I used Google to help identify any important recent laws and then I tried to see how they went in order to get a feel for quickly or slowly a bill could become law. What I found was that the process can be amazingly fast compared to the US. The Arms Amendment Bill passed in the immediate aftermath of Christchurch took less than 2 weeks to become law. The Climate Change Response Amendment Bill took approximately 6 months. The End of Life Choice Bill (i.e., euthanasia) took about 2 years (it was introduced on 6/8/17 and passed on 11/13/19). My takeaway was that 3/15/2020 is definitely a feasible date. It depends on the kinds of objections the Opposition has and the Labor Party's willingness to make changes (and it's NZ First and Green Party partners to go along with them). 3. The next election is fall 2020. The last one was fall 2017, and this is when Labor won enough support to form a national government. 4. a) The gun buyback program from the April 2019 legislation didn't seem to be executed very well. In December 2019 it was reported that buybacks were much lower than expected, possibly because the government set the prices too low. Another problem is participants in the buyback program had a security breach involving their private information. I'd think that this episode undermines Labor's promises that the registry legislation will successful safeguard people's privacy. However, I am fairly confident they are not giving up on the registry, because there haven't been any suggestions this would happen. 4. b) The Select Committee's report is due about a month from now, on 10-Feb-2020.
