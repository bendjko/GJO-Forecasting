A historic high price, sitting just above the previous high levels from around 2008. The current high price is most likely explained by some combination of sanctions against Russia (Second largest Aluminum producing country after China at 6% of global production), reduced supply due to interruptions in production caused by COVID, High energy costs (Aluminum smelting is highly energy intensive, with energy costs accounting for more than a third of production costs), and increased demand in the auto and aerospace industry as military spending is being increased worldwide/COVID restrictions ease/Secular trend of the auto industry transitioning from steel to aluminum to increase fuel efficiency. Most of these causes are likely to remain in place if not get worse. As such I am assuming a base case of continued high prices, with the path of least resistance in the short term  being upwards. I think ultimately global energy prices will come down as one or a couple of OPEC+, Venezuela, and Iran are all viable options to try and tap to increase supply. Something that will be very politically motivating, especially in the US which is facing midterm elections this year.

cause prices to rise an extra bit, too.\nBloomberg, Jan 19: \"lcoa Corp., the largest U.S. aluminum producer, warned investors Wednesday that any conflict between Russia and Ukraine could have an impact on the global market for the metal. Chief Executive Officer Roy Harvey said any kind of aggression could have an impact to supply coming out of Russia, the world\u2019s second-largest aluminum producer. It could also cause a rise in energy prices, which would have a knock-on effect to the aluminum industry given the high energy consumption needed to make the metal. Responding to a question about what risks the industry would face if a conflict arose, Harvey said it could disrupt demand as well. \u201cThat can very quickly impact the supply,\u201d Harvey said in a call with analysts. ... Russia accounted for about 3.6 million metric tons of aluminum production in 2020, tying it with India as the second-largest producer in the world, according to the U.S. Geological

Nonetheless, I'm increasing my forecast on the bottom 2 bins because volatility happens. I thought I'd also raise another potential issue: what happens if Omicron starts spreading in China? I don't think there is a big risk of this happening, as the Chinese government is doing everything possible to prevent its spread. But Omicron is one of the most contagious viruses the world has ever seen. It likely causes more severe disease than the ancestral variant, too. If it were to spread within the relatively immunologically naive population of China, where somewhere probably over 50% of the population is fully vaccinated with a vaccine that has substantially lower efficacy than vaccines used in the US and W Europe, the effects could be catastrophic for both the Chinese people and the Chinese economy. Similarly, stringent lockdowns to prevent Covid spread, as in Xi'an, could cause large disruptions.

Al ended 2021 at 2807.5, about exactly where it would be if the 2021 trend present through Aug 2021 continued, had the Chinese energy crisis of the fall not happened. If that trend continued, Al should be at about exactly $3200 at the end of April 2022. Things that may upset that trend include decreased demand for Al for construction in China, temporary energy shortages particularly in China, and the effects of the Omicron wave worldwide. I think construction trends in China may tip Al into bin 5, so I place the most weight there, but I could picture either bin 4 or 6 happening almost as easily. Given that there are a lot of upward pressures on Al and that prices haven't been <$2k since the beginning of Feb 2021, I think bin 1 is extremely unlikely. I think bin 2 is also very unlikely, and bin 3 fairly unlikely, for similar reasons. But the index can be so volatile that I'll leave all possibilities on the table. The crowd strongly favors bin 4 over bins 3 or 5, but I can't forecast such a strong preference at this time given that the index can rise or fall 2 bins in a matter of weeks.

Several factors out of China contribute to a positive trend: smelters with own power plants face rising coal costs [1], some of those reliant on the grid find their preferential electricity pricing withdrawn - including in Xinjiang, the second-largest domestic primary aluminum producer [2]. Moreover, all smelters have been presented with production ceilings, and these have also happened for magnesium - a critical input for most primary aluminum production [3] [4].  As a result, Chinese aluminum prices rose above the rest of the world, triggering an import wave that saw the previous yearly import record beaten by 10% in just 11 months [5]. Because these higher prices were caused by structural (or, at the very least, medium-term) factors, I feel inclined to believe the trend will be robust and continue until the closing date. This also supports the view that already in 2022 a global \"surplus\" of aluminum may be a relic of the past [6], though this may play out later in the year, as decrease in Chinese demand may balance the load. I *think* there is room for energy costs for EU smelters [7] to drop meaningfully by the closing date, but it is unclear how much this could affect the final price. Despite loud proclamations, EU ETS reform does not seem to be on the table for heavy industry in the examined time period.  A very simple extrapolation from the 2021 trend would see end of April 3M futures prices at just over 3,000 - quite safely in bucket 5. Based on continued demand and the Chinese trends, it would seem wise not to undervalue this bucket, which the crowd seems to be doing at the moment. The criticality of aluminum in both construction and automotive (esp. EVs) diversifies its uses/diffuses risk. While it may seem that greater attention must be paid to recycling [8], with the drive for quality in both construction and EVs, it doesn\u2019t seem to me at this point that recycling would be in a position to stop or reverse the price trends on its own.  Exogenous risk: Australia, Guinea, China, Brazil, and Indonesia were responsible for over 94% of both world bauxite supply and alumina refinery production in 2020 [9]. With regards to Australian and Indonesian supply, I could not identify any potential upsets in early 2022 that would threaten this, as the latter has already expressed its intention to stop bauxite exports in 2022 [10]. As noted previously, price pressure from China will more notably emerge due to the continuation of the factors above. Elections in Brazil are not happening until way past the closing date, being scheduled for October.  However, Guinea is number 2 for Bauxite mining, and saw a coup in Sept 2021. The military junta currently ruling the country \"temporarily\" has yet to outline a timetable for elections and restoration of civilian rule. If nearby Mali is anything to go by, this will not happen for some further time, and ECOWAS will soon start issuing further sanctions - they signaled they would like to see elections by March [11]. Even small disruptions in production - but more likely logistics - may drive futures upwards in the time period in question. Already back in September, news of the coup itself impacted futures even stronger than spot markets. By the end of April, I can see most if not all of the factors driving prices slowly upwards still influencing the futures. While the energy crunch in China will not be as drastic, I would not expect regulation to be stripped back, as the state will be keen to consolidate hard-won gains on the carbon budget front. Shipping will still be a pain, and if the past two years are anything to go by, we will be headed into the hottest months for EU industry [12]. New  production capacity is  planned for 2022, but it does not seem that it would be a massive game-changer in the time-frame required.\nIn conclusion, I think there is sufficient reasons to go against the crowd and put a decent stake on bin 5. Bins 1 and 6 are extremely improbable given the structure for aluminum demand. Bin 2 is reasonably the \"aluminum goes bust\" scenario, yet still unlikely. For now, I am sticking with escalating odds towards bin 5,  with the main signals outside of China and automotive demand/shipping issues/energy prices being developments in Guinea, the opening of new smelters which push us towards bin 4 [1], and any accidents/strikes in existing smelters. \n-----\nSide-note: EU imposed significant duties on aluminum converter foil from China in December 2021 [13]. Could this have any effect in the aftermath of a relaxed China aluminum market? Could not find any leads to further investigate this, but could be interesting to check in on later.

Yes, between August and October of this year it spiked from ~2500 to ~3100. So whatever is happening is probably either structural or pandemic-related, and not something new to 2021. I'm not seeing any great justification for why those price rises began, other than just demand outstripping supply in the face of high shipping costs. I don't think that electricity rationing in China really has anything to do with this, so for now I will just model this. We're looking at 3% growth monthly, on average, since May 2020, with a roughly linear trend. It looks like about 90% of the time, prices stay within a range of about $300 in either direction. So I'll just project growth as linear and model normally. That gives 17%, 68%, 15% for the range starting at 2600. That seems wrong. What if we model the equivalent month-on-month increase and say, hey, suppose there's a 20% chance that things will just go negative?

Mg shouldn't be a long term issue as it seems to be a just in time production type of commodity  because it doesn't seem to store very well.\nSo I think that I will go back to forecast a bit better on historical prices rather than being a) anchored by the crowd, b) swayed by others analysis, c) assuming something exciting is about to happen because why else would GJO ask the question. @belikewater "], [103205, "2021-11-11T21:17:04Z", [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.25, 0.1, 0.05], ""], [691, "2021-11-11T18:35:33Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.22, 0.45, 0.26, 0.07], ""], [1333, "2021-11-11T15:19:42Z", [0.0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.22, 0.7, 0.02], ""], [99943, "2021-11-11T15:16:27Z", [0.01, 0.04, 0.1, 0.36, 0.4, 0.09], "With all the pent up demand for products containing aluminum, barring some new catastrophe, I don't think it's likely that prices will be lower on April 29, 2022 than they are now."], [79069, "2021-11-11T13:49:05Z", [0.01, 0.04, 0.25, 0.4, 0.23, 0.07], ""], [101422, "2021-11-11T13:26:36Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.15, 0.4, 0.29, 0.16], ""], [691, "2021-11-10T18:56:48Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.26, 0.41, 0.26, 0.07], ""], [34959, "2021-11-10T14:58:20Z", [0.01, 0.04, 0.15, 0.44, 0.27, 0.09], ""], [55987, "2021-11-10T14:39:30Z", [0.06, 0.14, 0.22, 0.26, 0.2, 0.12], ""], [21884, "2021-11-10T03:58:37Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.15, 0.6, 0.2, 0.05], ""], [86607, "2021-11-10T01:26:43Z", [0.01, 0.07, 0.34, 0.34, 0.18, 0.06], ""], [87175, "2021-11-09T19:53:48Z", [0.2, 0.4, 0.35, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [79069, "2021-11-09T09:43:22Z", [0.01, 0.05, 0.22, 0.35, 0.27, 0.1], ""], [86367, "2021-11-07T23:55:27Z", [0.03, 0.13, 0.21, 0.29, 0.24, 0.1], ""], [102737, "2021-11-07T23:25:41Z", [0.0, 0.02, 0.32, 0.48, 0.12, 0.06], "Looks like China is doing everything it can to maximize near-term coal supply, thus setting the stage for more adequate electricity for people and manufacturing.

China is a major global producer of coal, and it's intervention in spot thermal coal prices has recently lead to a significant easing of Al prices as a consequence. So China will play a big role by managing their energy crisis via coal and Al. The link with coal is shown here:\nhttps://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3151710/chinas-power-crisis-why-it-happening-how-bad-it-and-what-if?module=perpetual_scroll&pgtype=article&campaign=3151710 Then we've got Magnesium, where shortages could heavily affect the supply chain: https://www.reuters.com/article/ousivMolt/idUSKBN2HC19Y\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-14/aluminum-makers-sound-the-alarm-about-u-s-magnesium-shortage\nMg counts for about 5% of higher grade light weight aluminium, used predominantly in the auto industry, aerospace and drinks canning (although 65-70% of the canning industry is recycled).  Mg prices have spiked massively due to production shortages, again from China, and pent up demand from the auto industry (EV markets in particular) and construction look likely to put continued pressure on the supply side. But will Mg availability issues push things higher still or lower? If Mg supplies run out the price of Al could fall in response to the whole supply chain slowdown. Over 95% of EU demands (and 85% global) for Mg are supplied by China - almost total dependancy - and China has all but stopped supply since September, leading to another potential crisis in the EU if stocks run out end of November. This threat means that EU industry is already heavily engaged with China to avert further problems,  which may reduce the longer-term risk:\nhttps://www.european-aluminium.eu/media/3285/2021-10-22-cross-industry-statement_magnesium-supply-crisis-in-europe_final.pdf\nBut the issue is cost, not the element itself, which is still abundant (the third most plentiful metal). So while there will be increasing pressure on pricing through the term of the question I think this will be capped by China's management of coal and its energy crisis, perhaps by US and other production (although Matalco Inc. in the US may ration delivery in 2021), along with a possible supply-chain slowdown that could cool prices.

I don't currently see why prices won't continue to increase, especially with pent-up demand for vehicles, whose production uses about 1/4 of global aluminum supplies. Construction gets another 25%, and that doesn't seem to be slowing down. In short, if demand or all sorts of goods continues to grow apace in 2022, aluminum prices could well continue moving upwards, with the possibility of occasional spikes due to a variety of kinds of bad news for the industry. But there are currently signs that the upward trend in price is slowing. The 2020 pandemic trend would put aluminum at around 3200 to 3300 by the end of 2021, but that doesn't currently look likely to me, barring a repeat catastrophic magnesium shortage. The 2021 trend would put aluminum at about 2800 by the end of the year, which is completely plausible, and somewhere almost exactly around 3200 by the end of April. As the growth trend in the price of aluminum will likely continue to slow, I will guess that if the current trend continues, that aluminum will be between 2900 and 3200 by the end of April.
