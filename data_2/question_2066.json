Covid is stopping it from opening its borders because its vaccines are inadequate. It means they face a huge - post Covid lockdown wave - and the risk to stable government that a wave would bring will make it something the CCP will do everything it can to avoid. It will stay lockdown \"forever\". \nWhich in a way suits the CCP, because I suspect it has no intention of ever opening up to the world again. It wants to keep its people locked down within its borders, and perhaps even locked down within their provinces. Ostensibly on the grounds of stopping Covid's spread. But the real reason, is managing the spread of dangerous ideas. \nIt's gambling that its economy has reached autarky, and no longer needs its people to engage with the outside world. We are seeing it already shutting down large companies, and shutting down all uncontrollable social media avenues, like gaming. \nHong Kong has meant it can no longer convince the people of Taiwan that China sticks to its promises, so it's a lost cause, with war the only way to get it back. The added instability to an already unstable domestic environment means war is not on its short to medium term agenda. And the rapid fall of Afghanistan will have only reminded it of how quickly regimes fall - China lives in fear of becoming another USSR. \nUSA will want to drive home its advantage, and no longer distracted by lesser conflicts, like Afghanistan, it will focus on containing China. To that end, it will beef up its control of independent states around China - one being Taiwan. That means leaning on allies to support Taiwan while internal strifes distract China. \nWith the Western vaccines breaking the link between Covid and death, it can get back to normal and get on with foreign policy. \nChina has shown Europe it does not honour contracts, and a country that does that, cannot be invested in, making further trade with China a lost cause. So Europe may as well look elsewhere in the area, and that is Taiwan. \nSo yes, the driver is there for the EU to open negotiations with Taiwan on an investment agreement before 1st Jan 2021.

However, the EU being ever pragmatic, does trade between the two parties, but the EU does have a trade deficit with Taiwan. An investment agreement, as viewed by the EU, is perhaps a method of evening up the balance of trade. The EU\u2019s concept of an investment agreement is as follows:\nLevel playing field for EU investors\nTransparency in business dealings\nSustainable development, human rights, labour rights and environmental standards\nSocial responsibility\nResponsible business practices\nAttract investment into the EU\nRegulate home economies in the public interest. None of which would appear to be a problem in dealing with Taiwan as the EU treats the island as a like-minded partner. But why now?\nChina predictably, has reacted by stating that groundless human rights claims is an excuse to halt progress on deal that would benefit European businesses and consumers.\nRelations between China and the EU have soured in 2021 due to competing sanctions concerning human rights in Xinjiang and security laws in Hong Kong that resulted in stalling the proposed investment agreement between the two parties.  The question refers to a suggestion by the EU Commission to \u2018open\u2019 negotiations with Taiwan over an investment agreement. Considering the historical record of the EU process of negotiations it is quite probable that talks could possibly continue for the next seven years, that perhaps offers the EU with a bargaining chip in its negotiations/relations with China.\nThe EU would also be cognizant of the current talks between the Biden administration and Taiwan concerning a trade deal and will not wish to be left behind.\nIt is possible that given Germany\u2019s (via Merkel) to push for an investment with China, it could block proposed talks to avoid antagonizing a major customer for its goods.\nAlso, China is quite capable of influencing various EU member states to use their veto (Hungary being a prime example) by exerting its economic pressure to avoid any potential of agreement talks.  https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-30/u-s-taiwan-to-talk-chips-vaccines-as-long-stalled-talks-begin  https://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/accessing-markets/investment/  https://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/countries/taiwan/  https://www.rfi.fr/en/international/20210507-french-senate-s-taiwan-vote-triggers-beijing-s-anger-again  https://www.rfi.fr/en/business/20210520-european-parliament-votes-to-freeze-eu-china-investment-deal-cai-human-rights-sanctions-xinjiang-hong-kong https://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/countries/taiwan/  https://borderlex.net/2021/05/26/comment-eu-taiwan-relations-in-the-indo-pacific-time-for-an-upgrade/  https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/why-europes-future-is-on-the-line-in-the-taiwan-strait/  https://www.cfr.org/blog/time-now-trade-deal-taiwan   EU to follow US not to be left out. https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-and-taiwan-set-date-to-revive-trade-and-investment-talks-11624626153  https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-30/u-s-taiwan-to-talk-chips-vaccines-as-long-stalled-talks-begin\n"], [34815, "2021-07-10T04:05:54Z", [0.0], ""], [101859, "2021-07-10T02:48:44Z", [0.25], ""], [100628, "2021-07-10T01:15:29Z", [0.0], "And upset China?
