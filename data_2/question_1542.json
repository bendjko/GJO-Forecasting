China has tackled the outbreak aggressively in their country. It does not appear that the number of deaths in China is increasing for the time being. Italy has also taken drastic measures to tackle the outbreak. Cases and deaths of COVID-19 have increased in Italy within February and March. It appears that the actions that those countries have taken may have stabilized the number of cases of COVID-19 which may halt the slow the number of deaths. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the National Health Service (NHS) and Health Canada, symptoms of COVID-19 may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to the virus. There is only 2 months, 3 weeks and 3 days left until June 1, 2020. There would need to be 1,486 fatalities of COVID-19 to bring the number up to 5,501 fatalities. It appears that there is not \"enough time\" for the number of fatalities to increase beyond 5,500 given the actions that affected countries and the WHO have taken.

The chances are that if they continue to understate, they are likely to do so at the current rate, which is factored in the above calculations. If they report true figures, this will increase the calculations above. \n- Western countries are preparing for the virus and reports suggest that testing could enable people to find out earlier which could assist saving lives. \n- Minus Iran, the countries outside of China who are reporting high volumes of cases are wealthy countries, mostly in the G7, with better health services. It is likely that they may be able to administer better care than China and thus the rate will slow.  Considering these factors, i will reduce my calculation by 15%  = 7077.

I'm uncertain yet how exactly to quantify this data but the Republic of Korea, Italy and Japan all have over 100 cases and are facing local transmission of the virus (as opposed to import from China) as well as 705 still aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship.  The WHO seems to have significant doubt about the ability of countries to mobilize to stop the spread of the coronavirus, and Americans are downright accusing their government of negligence in how the outbreak has been handled so far, with some employees alleging that people had been exposed to the virus without their knowledge. Due to a few factors including \n1) current mortality rate and projection of mortality for infected mostly within China \n2)  the apparent lack of symptoms of the disease combined with the number of questions about who could have been exposed or who could be carrying the disease\nI will have to predict that there will in fact be over 5,500 deaths from COVID-19, but the question is will it happen before June 1?

If you plot the daily change in the number of fatalities, you get a zigzag shape. But the number of people who die doesn't depend on how many people have died before, but on how many people are infected. According to the same dataset, visualised at https://public.tableau.com/profile/salvatore1114#!/vizhome/wdctest/COVID-19StatusUpdate, the mortality rate fluctuates between 2% and 3%. What it doesn't tell us is how long people were infected before they died. Also, most of the deaths so far have been in China. We don't know what the mortality rate will look like as the disease grows in other countries, which it is definitely doing. \nWhat we do know:\nThere are over 45,000 existing cases in China. If 2-3% of those succumb in the next 3 months which is the duration of the question, that makes 900 to 1350 fatalities. That already rules out the first two possible answers. There are about 3000 cases outside China, with big variations in mortality rates between countries. The numbers are pretty small in many countries meaning the rates are probably not reliable yet. South Korea has the most cases, with a 1% mortality rate that would add only about 12 people to the total. Iran has a rate of 14% but fewer cases so would only add about another 10.\nIf we assume current mortality rates will apply to currently infected people over the next 3 months (which is about as long as the disease has been running now to give us those rates), we get to between 3500 and 4500 deaths. If we allow that some of the new cases over the next 3 months may die, even if we don't know the rate, that means a possibility of over 4500 just because a lot more people are likely to be infected.

This is an opinion, but I suspect very much that the WHO will confirm the pandemic within the next week. Why? As a fact, Japan, South Korea, Italy and, of course, China all have cases for which they have no idea of the transmission route/vector. It is therefore out of control/an epidemic, in my view. If that is the case, it is so on two continents (and likely a two more in NA and Afr). That's a pandemic. What other facts do we have? The disease appears to be as contagious as flu, but has at least 10 (and possibly 30 or 40) times the mortality rate. If it is out of control, and if as contagious as flu, but, for argument's sake, 20 times more lethal, we are going to be *way* over 5,000 by June. Why? About 8% of the US population catches flu each season. But that's as high as 11% in winter. Let's say that we only have two months of peak virus season left. Let's also say that the weather will be warmer than usual (as Accuweather predicts). Let's also say the novelty of this makes people more likely to self isolate totally or partially. Let's therefore imagine that in developed economies, covering, conservatively, 1 billion people, only 2% of people catch it, and of those, it's only fatal in flu proportions (which we know it won't be). That's still 20,000 deaths by June, just in the developed world -- i.e. 10 times more than we need to get from where we are now to over 5,500. For it to be less, we would have to start seeing evidence of containment within the next week or so, but the trend at the moment, outside China, is the opposite.

What might happen then in the poorer countries that have usually more density in the population and less health care and prevention...?\n4) If the virus will keep going to spread at the same pace of today , we should expect more less the triple of the cases of infected and deaths for June 2020.  Answers:\n1) Today we have already more than 2500 cases of deaths, so the first possible answer must be 0%.\n2) This scenario is unlikely to happen because the virus is spreading and the number of infected is rising. They should find a cure in the next days and apply it to all the infected around the world. Moreover, a system of perfect quarantine has to be applied in every country.\n3) See above scenario 2).\n4) If the infection and death rate will decrease, this scenario could be realistic even without a cure before June.\n5) The most probable scenario following the current trend of the rise of the virus and given the data we can access today."], [21884, "2020-02-24T14:58:14Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.45, 0.35], ""], [691, "2020-02-24T14:45:48Z", [0.0, 0.18, 0.38, 0.23, 0.21], ""], [72737, "2020-02-24T14:35:47Z", [0.0, 0.02, 0.08, 0.2, 0.7], ""], [11430, "2020-02-24T14:24:57Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [49779, "2020-02-24T13:48:18Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95], "5856 is my number.

Assuming this stays constant (a huge assumption), this would lead to around 96,000 new reported cases (96 days * 1,000 new cases per day). Assume that total CFR remains constant at 3.1%. Note that the current CFR of cases outside of China is approx. 0.1% while the CFR within China is around 3.2% (and Hubei's CFR is 3.7%) based on the 23 February 2020 WHO Situation Report.

Overall, these simple linear projections should be taken with a grain of salt - epidemics, of course, do not scale linearly. But I take this approach because there is a lot of uncertainty at the moment, given that opposing forces are acting on the number of new confirmed deaths. Daily confirmed deaths are rapidly dropping off in China, but new clusters of cases are also rapidly appearing outside of China [3]. It is difficult to assess how these opposing trends counteract one another - hence, I have used a simple linear projection approach that assumes these two opposing trends will more-or-less cancel out.  In any case, the linear projection shows that the 5.5k death figure will be exceeded in March - and the timeline of this question extends for another two full months after that. Hence, I find it probable that 5.5k deaths will be exceeded.
