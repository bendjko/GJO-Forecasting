Putin's popularity is unsurprisingly a bit lower since COVID-19.  Also unsurprisingly, a greater number of people are \"unsure\" of whether to approve or disapprove of Putin, but his numbers are still high and tend to correlate fairly well or even better than expected with public votes in elections and so likely also for the public vote on these amendments to the constitution re-scheduled for July 1. \nhttps://www.levada.ru/en/ratings/\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48674705\nhttps://www.themoscowtimes.com/2019/08/09/a-timeline-of-putins-2-decades-in-power-a66787\nhttps://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2016/02/04/vladimir-putins-unshakeable-popularity\nhttps://akarlin.com/2011/06/are-russian-elections-rigged/\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/how-does-russia-meddle-in-elections-look-at-bulgaria-1490282352\nhttps://epthinktank.eu/2018/03/10/russias-2018-presidential-election-six-more-years-of-putin/results-of-russian-presidential-elections-opinion-polls/ Although the Kremlin has said that the popular vote will NOT technically be a referendum (https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/01/16/what-changes-is-putin-planning-for-russias-constitution-a68928; https://www.rferl.org/a/yes-or-no-is-a-referendum-in-the-cards-over-russian-pension-reform-/29426658.html), it will very likely be sufficient for the Russian govt to indicate popular support for the changes to the constitution.  Last year polls indicated a 68% popular approval of changing term limits (https://www.dw.com/en/russian-parliament-fast-tracks-putins-constitutional-changes/a-52106277).
