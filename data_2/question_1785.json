The only loss after 2 weeks comes from a divisional game where one team had to lose. They are currently undefeated against all other divisions.\nStarting from the bottom, the 49ers suffered a lot of injuries last Sunday that could have long-term consequences. They already lost the only division game played so far and with a potential ACL tear for one of their top rushers, a multitude of other injuries to key personnel, and their only win so far coming against a team many predict will finish in the bottom 3, the future is not looking bright for the 49ers (relative to the other teams in this division, mind you).\nI have the Rams at 13 here because of a poor Week 1 performance against the Cowboys and a seeming persistence of some of their struggles last year. They had a big win versus the Eagles this past weekend but it was far from convincing given the Eagles implosion in Week 1 and the talent in the NFC West. They need to be more clinical to make a real run this year.\nThe Cardinals have been exceptional thus far. They have the only divisional win, a dominant performance against the WFT, and a lot of exciting young talent. However, they have not yet shown that they can do it week in and week out. They have a fairly easy schedule in the coming weeks, so this may give them a chance to iron out kinks, gain confidence, and establish a lead in the division, but their next real test will come Week 7 versus the Seahawks.\nThe Seahawks are my favorite by a country mile. The game yesterday was not nearly as close as it may have appeared on paper as Seattle were largely hurt by a dropped pass returned for a Pick 6 in the opening minutes and a host of penalties that continually put them behind the sticks and advanced opponents drives beyond where they may have otherwise ended. They've shown they can handle a running QB (Newton), and ex-MVP (Ryan), and the top defenses in the business (Patriots). In the first two games, Wilson has recorded just one interception (which was not his fault) and an astonishing 9 TD passes and is nearly perfect when throwing for over 20 yards. This will be the team to beat, especially if they can address their foul troubles and heal up their defensive secondary.\nThat all being said, this will be an incredibly exciting division and, if it continues like this, may be the first example of one division providing both wildcard teams. The teams they play from other divisions are largely not the cream of the crop and if the divisional games are split the correct way, there could be three NFC teams that qualify for the playoffs this year.

Also, if you like forecasting on NFL questions, I just launched an NFL and fantasy football forecasting site [2] with tons of interesting questions like: * How many NFL players will have tested positive for COVID-19 by the end of the season? [3]\n* How many total fans will attend NFL regular season games in person in 2020? [4]\n* When will the last game of the 2020 NFL season be played? [5]\n* Will a sitting U.S. president attend an NFL 2020 season game in person? [6]\n* How many tweets from @realDonaldTrump will include \"NFL\" between September 2020 and March 2021? [7]\n* What will be the official name of the Washington Football Team on March 1st, 2021? [8] ...and more! I just launched the platform to family and friends and so would greatly appreciate any of you to come check it out and support it. As you can imagine, building a niche forecasting community is quite a challenge, so I really appreciate your upvotes on this comment and support by signing up and forecasting on some of the questions there!
