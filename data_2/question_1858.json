As the NG plants are the most flexible and versatile of all kinds, they are supposed to be the first to be quickly dimmed or shut down in times of plenty supply of solar or wind energy, and there's probably regulation that forces them to in order to safeguard grid stability. From that perspective, NG power plants will increasingly shift from being part of the base load into a back up, as soon as summer will arrive. As this question ends 01 June 2021 and near the annual maximum of solar energy production and usage, the info will send pricing signals to other linked energy markets, so that this question is probably closely intertwined with this\nhttps://www.gjopen.com/questions/1840-will-the-u-s-consume-more-energy-from-renewable-sources-in-may-2021-than-it-did-in-may-2019-according-to-the-u-s-energy-information-administration-eia Moreover, as the cost of production per MWh for e.g. solar power rapidly sinks on an annual basis, the breakeven point for gas usage (the point at which additional demand will fade in) compared to renewable energy sources of electricity, expressed in the spot price of Natural Gas will also be lowered incrementally, and profitability running gas power plants will be reached at ever lower spot prices. /the U.S. attempt to stop the Russian pipeline project \"Nordstream2\" in the Baltic Sea, which is highly controversial within the EU between e.g. Eastern European nations and Germany, does not appear to be successful in the end. The bulk of the hefty investment has been made, the pipeline is almost completed except from a few kilometers, and the Russian part of the syndicate is determined to go on whatever it takes. Threats of the US to single out Germany as a culprit and sanction municipalities, companies, individuals and politicians rather caused disgruntlement, annoyance, incomprehension and resistance towards the US position among Germans involved.\nTo cut a long story short, the likelihood is low and the hope maybe never materializes that in the near future the EU can function as a flourishing export market and an outlet for an excess production of (liquefied) NG, which will cause an excess supply on the domestic markets unless the supply is quickly limited (intentionally or by bankruptcies in the shale gas industry), since after almost one year of pandemic and reduced economic activity the subterranean cavern stores will be solidly filled. /the spot price of NG is heavily seasonal and thus correlates closely to the question how cold and long the winter season and the heating period will be, and how large a share of the US geographically will be that has an extended period of a snowy cold winter 2020/21. \n(i) In case the winter fuels a depletion of inventories, the price may spike to 4.00USD/MMBtu or more in February.\n(ii) In case the winter remains warm and mild, as it may be expected once in a few years in the wake of climate change, the price may peak at 3.00 to 3.50USD already. The following seasonal price decline will then critically depend on where it started at its peak.\n2.00USD or less on 01 June 2021 would be a record low, but considering the factors above, there are three of them that point to this record, while only one of them - maybe - supports higher prices, from my point of view.\nIt is too soon to be determined, and there will likely not be a reliable indication of the final answer before mid-February 2021."], [96987, "2020-12-11T02:49:14Z", [0.0, 0.45, 0.45, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2020-12-10T19:20:56Z", [0.0, 0.99, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [34815, "2020-12-10T19:20:54Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2020-12-10T17:55:18Z", [0.01, 0.67, 0.3, 0.02, 0.0], ""], [81567, "2020-12-10T16:41:47Z", [0.0, 0.8, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [88452, "2020-12-10T16:09:07Z", [0.4, 0.6, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [59881, "2020-12-10T15:36:55Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.99, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2020-12-09T20:39:03Z", [0.02, 0.63, 0.3, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [48709, "2020-12-09T20:21:49Z", [0.1, 0.5, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1], ""], [1333, "2020-12-09T19:22:27Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [88452, "2020-12-09T19:13:33Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [97203, "2020-12-09T19:08:42Z", [0.0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.1, 0.0], "https://longforecast.com/natural-gas-forecast-2017-2018-2019"], [22689, "2020-12-09T18:25:29Z", [0.05, 0.4, 0.5, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [22689, "2020-12-09T18:22:11Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.1], ""]], "open_date": "2020-12-09T18:00:39Z", "close_date": "2021-06-01T07:01:39Z"}
