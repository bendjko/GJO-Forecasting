I'm going off of their work as it seems like very astute statistical analysis.  The first assumes a player's batting average is their true batting average and estimates the probability a player hits above .400 for a full season and for a 60 game season. They find that there is about a 3% chance of any player hitting over .400 for a 60 game season. [1]  The second follows a similar procedure but is less stringent on their assumptions about a players \"true batting average.\" As a result, they get around a 9.5% chance of someone hitting over .400 for the season. [2] From those it seems like any estimate from 90-99% for the 0 category seems pretty reasonable. The only thing that I'd like to add to their analysis is that this season could end up being shorter than 60 games. If the season ended up being only 30 games would this question still be valid? If so, it seems that we should increase our estimate for the non zero categories.  For example, Charlie Blackmon is hitting .484 through 16 games and if the season cancels soon (or the Rockies get hit with many coronavirus cases) it seems possible that he would end up over .400.
