The Chilean economy has been growing but Chile has one of the highest levels of inequality in the world.   The state of emergency was lifted in response to rescinding the fare hikes the president's promises to increase the minimum wage, cap health care costs and raise taxes on the wealthy.  I think there will be public order as long as there is progress toward these promises. The government seems to be somewhat right wing but the president is a well educated billionaire with a PH.d in economics from Harvard.  His father was Chile's ambassador to the UN when he was a child living in NYC.   Hence, he may understand the limits of state power to protect the Chilean ruling class.  After all, Chile had an agricultural based economic system with much of the land owned by a very small percentage of the population.  I could not find current figures on the concentration of agricultural land or ownership of the copper industry.    In any event, I suspect the people will give the government a few weeks (Nov. 26 is only two weeks away) to see if it will keep its promises.  Hence, there is probably an 80 percent chance the government will move forward, at least a bit, on its promises.   Put another  way, a 20 percent chance of not going forward in the next two weeks.  Add 10 percent because the people might not wait.

And they did this by organizing mass fare-dodging. They went from their high schools to the subway station and started jumping the turnstiles. Students in New York City are doing this now, right? Yes, that\u2019s right!\nAmazing. Anyway, the government responded by saying they were just criminals. Then people reacted in a very interesting way. Even grown-ups joined the protest, and started jumping turnstiles to evade the fare. That was on Monday, the 14th. By Wednesday, a lot of people started talking. And I remember watching a video of like 100, 200 people inside a subway station chanting, \u201cThe people united will never be defeated.\u201d That, you may know, is a super-relevant song for the Chilean people during the \u201960s and \u201970s. On Friday, they suddenly decided to suspend the subway service. Thousands of people that would normally use the subway were just walking around the city trying to find a bus or just walking back to their houses after work. So people were really fed up. You could sense that in the air. And then people started attacking subway stations. Some were burned. We still don\u2019t know how much of that was done by protesters. There has been some evidence that the fires started inside the stations, in places with restricted access. That created the idea that maybe it was a setup. We don\u2019t know. By Friday night, the government decided to declare a state of emergency, and that means basically bringing the military to be in charge of public order. That was when definitely this thing exploded. No one wants to see the military in the streets.
