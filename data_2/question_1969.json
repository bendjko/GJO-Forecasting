TL;DR: It looks like SPAC Insider counts Gross IPO Proceeds as those IPOs that have moved into the \"search\" phase. Since April 1, IPOs moving into the \"search\" phase have fallen off a cliff. There are 191 days left in 2021. If this trend continues (49 IPOs/83 days = about 1 IPO every 2 days), we can expect an additional 113 IPOs to be filed by Dec 31, 2021. The average IPO size so far this year has been $311.8 million. If the average size holds steady, then we can forecast an additional $35.233 billion in SPAC IPOs this year. Adding in the $107.818 billion we've already seen, perhaps the total will approach $143 billion.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The question is asking us to predict Gross Proceeds of SPAC IPOs... which I believe does not include everything after the SPAC files for the IPO (its de-spac and merger with an existing company, which they have 2 years to do). Predicting what will happen in 2021 to all of the existing SPAC IPOs would entail a look at 2019/2020 SPAC listings, but again I don't think that's what the question is asking. SPAC proceeds for 2020 were $83.361 billion on 248 IPOs (spacanalytics.com). Looking at the \"SPAC Status by Year of IPO\" table at https://spacinsider.com/stats/ allows us to see the breakdown. The totals for \"Searching\", \"Announced\", and \"Completed\" are 248 for 2020. Similarly, SPAC Analytics says SPAC IPOs for 2021 totals 347, which is the total for \"Searching\", \"Announced\", and \"Completed\" for 2021 listed by SPAC Insider. I see a trend. So as the SPAC IPO is listed, the SPAC searches for a company to take public, announces a deal, then completes the deal. But, we aren't concerned with what stage the SPAC is at. We are only predicting if they'll move into the \"search\" phase based on their 2021 IPO. I think the \"SPAC IPO Pipeline\" row at SPAC Analytics shows what we are looking for: the number of SPAC IPOs that are awaiting the next phase- \"Searching for a deal.\" This indicates 288 IPOs totaling ~$70 billion are waiting. Hard to say when those will shake free. We are currently sitting at $107.818 billion on 347 SPAC IPOs (314 searching, 32 announced, 1 completed). Since we essentially only care about IPOs that move into the \"Search\" phase, how likely is that?  The first 89 days of 2021 featured 265 IPOs (Jan 1 - Mar 31).\nThe past 83 days have featured 49 IPOs (Apr 1 - Jun 23). IPOs moving into the \"search\" phase have fallen off a cliff. There are 191 days left in 2021. If this trend continues (49 IPOs/83 days = about 1 IPO every 2 days), we can expect an additional 113 IPOs to be filed by Dec 31, 2021. The average IPO size so far this year has been $311.8 million. If the average size holds steady, then we can forecast an additional $35.233 billion in SPAC IPOs this year.

Fitting simple exponential curve to last 3 years of SPAC gross proceeds leaves us with a projection of just under $180B. Fitting a linear model to the same data predicts ~$108B.  SPAC's seem to be slowing down in the last 2-3 months, various market corrections (see: SPACdex vs S&P 500 https://spacinsider.com/stats/) and new regulatory pushback (see: https://www.wsj.com/articles/spac-hot-streak-put-on-ice-by-regulatory-warnings-11618565403).  Given these factors, I find it quite unlikely for SPAC's to exceed the exponential forecast of $178B in gross proceeds for 2021. Of course, trying to predict the market is always a challenge and perhaps other forces unknown to me will re-heat spac markets. $180B+: 10%  Given SPAC's have already generated 100B in gross proceed as of early May, 140-180 seems the most likely to me: 55%  If SPAC's continue to be put on hold due to regulations and market volatility through the end of the year, the $100B-140B does not seem unreasonable, this towards the lower half of the projections (linear model outcome): 35%  These figures will be updated as new information comes to light.  I originally intended to answer this question back in late March: the following are my notes from that time... not sure they are  all still relevant...  Drawback's:\n1) Rising rates makes pre-revenue/growth  companies less attractive (cash flows don't come immediately and are being discounted at a higher rate). SPAC's often target these sorts of companies. We see the market's reaction to this phenomenon. SPAC's are down considerably from their February highs, wiping out nearly all their gains for the year (down 15%). https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/04/spacs-are-becoming-less-of-a-sure-thing-as-the-deals-get-stranger-shares-roll-over.html 2) continued viability of SPAC target acquisitions\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/04/spacs-are-becoming-less-of-a-sure-thing-as-the-deals-get-stranger-shares-roll-over.html 407 companies IPO'ed in 2020, 247 SPAC IPO's, and a handful of direct listings... rounding to 650 companies total started trading publicly in 2020 ( ~40% via SPAC).  I question how many companies may be ready to become public. Let's assume there's some growth (5%) in the number of companies that go public in 2021, so hypothetically 680 companies go public in 2021. There are currently 400 SPAC's that are searching for companies to merge with and 200 already have done so in 2021. Let's say, conservatively, 50% of the searching SPACs close a deal in 2021 (200 IPO's). That would mean roughly 60% (400/680) of all companies that go public in 2021 choose the SPAC route. That's a 50% increase over the 2020 percentage, which many are calling the year of the SPAC.  Companies choose to IPO on their own terms, when they are ready. With SPAC's there is so much money floating around that SPAC sponsors may approach companies that are not ready to be publicly traded, but accept the deal anyways because the offer is attractive. These pre-mature companies may lose investors money, which will in turn make SPAC's as a whole less popular.
