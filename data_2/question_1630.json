Obviously, 2020 is anything but a typical year. Although it is not official yet, we are likely in a recession in the United States (we will not know for certain until GDP estimates of the past 6 months are finalized). 2020 is also an election year, which likely has a small impact on the number of municipal bankruptcies, as local election calendars are not overly correlated with the timing of national elections. In years of recession, however, there have an average number of municipal bankruptcies. In 1981 and 1982 three were 2 and 3 bankruptcies respectively. 1990 and 1991 experienced 19 and 13. 2001 brought 8 bankruptcies. In 2008 there were only 4 bankruptcies. There seems to be a lagging trend in the data, that bankruptcies increase in the years following a recession. The most recent year we had 12 or more bankruptcies was 2012. I used the 2020 Q1 F-5A LTM report and compared it to the 2019 Year End report to calculate the number of chapter 9 bankruptcies in the US so far. As of 3/31, there had been 2 Chapter 9 bankruptcies: one in Jack County, Texas and one in Douglas County, Nebraska. Since the end of March, there has been one notable chapter 9 bankruptcy so far in Fairfield, Alabama. This brings us to an estimated total of 3 this year. I will update this as Q2 filings become available. I compared commercial bankruptcy data to municipal bankrupt data, through the two metrics are not entirely correlated with one another. Municipalities will be hit with lower tax revenues this year, but not as badly as state and federal governments. Sales tax makes up only 7% of municipal revenue on average, with intergovernmental transfers and property taxes accounting for over 65% of revenues. Because the coronavirus pandemic strongly depressed retail spending, but has had less of an impact on real estate, I do not expect that the coronavirus will be as big a catalyst for municipal bankruptcies as it may seem, though intergovernmental transfers will be affected. Costs will be exceptionally high this year. Hospitals and healthcare centers will continue to shoulder the financial burden of the pandemic. I think the majority of municipal governments have benefitted from the longest economic expansion in US history, which ended earlier this year. Because the coronavirus pandemic\u2019s resulting recession is unique from other financial crisis we\u2019ve experience in the past forty years, I think it will have less of an impact on municipal bankruptcies. My prediction, and hope, is that municipalities are not as cash strapped given the recent economic expansion. I do not think local governments will be as hard hit as state and the federal government. In the past 38 years, there have only been 5 years which had over 12 municipal bankruptcies. 1 of these 5 years occurred in the first year of a recession. I think we are still at greater risk this year that this base rate. My estimate is that there is a 30% chance of having 12 or more municipal bankruptcies this year. This would imply 9 in the next 6 months. https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-are-sources-revenue-local-governments\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/04/coronavirus-cities-bankruptcy/609169/\nFederal Court Filings"], [93358, "2020-07-20T17:38:08Z", [0.75], ""], [80790, "2020-07-20T11:29:32Z", [0.63], "Let\u2019s reread the question!

However, just by looking at the numbers, the highest years are 2019, 2011, 2012, and 2014, the years following the great recession. Also, 11 were declared in 2000, the end of the dot com bubble burst. Given the huge impact of COVID on GDP growth, I would revise up my estimate by 15%.\n2. Looking at historical data, about 1/3 of the bankruptcies were declared by hospitals and healthcare munis. This is extremely concerning, given COVID effectively ended elective procedures around the country, which usually count about 30% of impatient revenue.

Original logic below... ---- Longterm base rate quite low...didn\u2019t count, but graph looks like around 10%. Reinforcing a number in that range are the numbers from the most recent recession: first spike trailed by two years, with peak four years following beginning of recession. This seems like a strong signal that a spike of magnitude in question is very unlikely this year. Another simple factor reinforcing my 10%-ish instinct: it appears that there have only been two Chapter 9s filed so far in 2020\u2013\u2013one in the most recent F-5A report [2], and one reported in the news this week [3]. With approximately 40% of the year gone, that leaves a very steep climb to get to 12 over seven months. However, one issue not discussed in any comments so far is that public hospitals are one of the types of municipalities that can file under Chapter 9. COVID is placing immense fiscal strain on hospitals generally [4]. I couldn\u2019t find articles specific to challenges faced by public hospitals, but I assume that it would be similar or worse, with respect to private hospitals. There were only 61 public hospital BKs under Chapter 9 between 1980 and 2018 (1.6 per year), but if we were to see several times that base rate this year (which seems plausible given the nature of the crisis)\u2013\u2013perhaps six hospitals\u2013\u2013and then add that to the longterm average of non-hospital Chapter 9s (6.5 per year), then your\u2019e right above the threshold. I would be in the 10-15% range if not for this hospital bit, for which I increase to 22%. If we don\u2019t see a surge of Chapter 9s in the next couple of months, I\u2019ll be dialing this down quickly. All figures above are from [1] unless noted otherwise.

Started out on the more positve side but as it turns out my gut couldn't be trusted. After reading your analysis, I dug into some other statistics. I thought that with unemployment rising as a result of COVID-19, foreclosures might rise which would cascade into property taxes - the main source of local i.e. municipal income, putting many places under pressure. According to the latest statstics, 72 percent of local and state revenue comes from property taxes. This is down from 80 percent in 1977. [1] So states have succeeded in diversifying somewhat but are still very dependent on this one revenue stream. Where my argument breaks down is that foreclosures are actually back to Q1 2005 lows before the housing crisis ramped up. In fact, foreclosure rates are back to pre-recession levels in 61 percent of the US. [2] While some may read this as the calm before the storm, and with good reason perhaps, it does mean that localities have breathing room before things get really dire. This is crucial to the timing element of the question, of course. Most states are actually in relatively healthy financial positions based on the most current information I could find with a brief search.[3] All this combined with your analysis leads me to think that most places will be able to weather the storm this year and while things might get difficult it won't push bankrupcies into uncharted territory as you mentioned. Hope this information might be encouraging and helpful.

In 2009, this sheet (https://www2.census.gov/govs/pubs/state_loc_gov/state_loc_gov_2009.pdf) indicates that local government revenues minus expenditures summed for a shortfall of $200 billion. Assuming the current shortfall will be broadly similar, then 3/4 of the shortfall will be mitigated by the government's stimulus. In addition, it's not clear that property values will fall as they did during the 08 recession, and property taxes make up a significant portion of municipal revenue: in 2009 they constituted 3/4 of all municipal tax revenue. Still, the situation is unusual, so I inflate my estimate form 10% to 25%."], [87427, "2020-05-22T20:09:24Z", [0.9], ""], [1333, "2020-05-22T18:40:44Z", [0.98], ""], [79591, "2020-05-22T18:08:08Z", [0.25], "- Last peak in bankruptcies was 2009 - 2014, predominantly by special purpose districts (healthcare a major one).

Local governments will be be hit by a double whammy due to the Covid19 pandemic. They will have increasing costs due to healthcare and citizen services related heads, while having to deal with a 80% to 90% fall in revenue from sources like sales tax and property tax. This will be a pretty unique situation, one which has not been seen even during the times of the GFC. There could be a lag effect which could push actual filings to CY 2021 (but the pandemic might accelerate things, unlike a steady downturn which could take years to play out). Chapter 9 could be expanded to include States also - but we could ignore the impact of this (50 states vs 1000s of other local government bodies).  The city of Fairfield, Alabama has just filed for Chapter 9. Though they have been in financial trouble for long, the pandemic pushed them over.

However, I'm not sure how much the base rate tells us since the economic downturn that's gonna happen this year hasn't happened in the past century. I think the 1990-1991 recession is among the best indicators for what could happen this time (since that also started early in the year), which implies that the probability is a lot higher than 20%. Another issue is that there is a bit of a lag in the data; since the pandemic started so early in the year, though, I think many of the bankruptcies will happen in late 2020 as opposed to 2021.
