There was no opposition participation in the last elections (boycotted), which undermines the election results even further.  There were a couple of articles (one cited below) that point out that Chad is one of the strongest militaries in the region, and highly competent in supporting countries like France conducting counter-terrorism ops in the Sahel.  Because some Western countries rely on that stability (regardless of who is running the country), they are unlikely to raise the issue and just maintain the status quo.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_Chad\nhttps://www.gjopen.com/questions/1918-before-1-october-2021-will-the-republic-of-chad-announce-that-legislative-elections-currently-scheduled-for-24-october-2021-will-be-postponed-or-canceled"], [23187, "2021-02-04T14:42:54Z", [0.89], ""], [94872, "2021-02-04T06:00:20Z", [0.9], ""], [46339, "2021-02-03T19:12:34Z", [0.8], ""], [34959, "2021-02-03T08:10:40Z", [0.87], ""], [18679, "2021-02-03T03:07:54Z", [0.99], ""], [81567, "2021-02-02T23:59:45Z", [1.0], ""], [53391, "2021-02-02T19:06:00Z", [0.9], "Walking up from 80% because maybe i am being too hopeful of a coherent africa policy by State dept."], [73970, "2021-02-02T17:22:17Z", [0.9], ""], [13657, "2021-02-02T12:26:39Z", [0.99], ""], [97501, "2021-02-02T08:09:47Z", [0.95], "The pandemic has already been a reason for postponement (when there were only about 20 cases/day, source: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).

Three Burundian peacekeepers were killed and an additional two were wounded. The attack occurred hours after a rebel coalition fighting the government called off a unilateral truce and reiterated calls for the suspension of the election.[...]\nDuring the first round, voting was unable to take place in 29 of the 71 sub-prefectures according to Augustin Yangana-Yahote, the Minister for Territorial Administration. Six others only managed to partially vote before being shut down due to voter intimidation.Observers noted possible irregularities in the conduct of the election. An observer group reported that a large number of voters cast ballots with letters of exemption in Bangui. The procedure allows voters to cast their ballot elsewhere than the polling station where they are registered. According to the Rainbow Network, 81 percent of the votes were cast in this manner.\"\nFaustin-Archange Touad\u00e9ra has been voted president in the first round due to a slim 53% majority, which is however obviously the intended result of massive irregularities.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%9321_Central_African_general_election#Conduct \"Fighting between rebel groups and the CAR's national army has continued around the country since the election. The rebels declared an intent to take the war to Bangui, but a combination of the army, UN peacekeepers and Russian troops have prevented them from doing so.\"\nEven though an outright war could be prevented so far, the massive outbreak of violence has caused 100,000 persons to be displaced (with about 2m or roughly half of the population suffering from decades-long unrest anyway), international organizations already speak of a large-scale humanitarian crisis looming.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%9321_Central_African_general_election#Reactions_and_aftermath Chad shares a 1,554km border with the C.A.R., which has a longer border only with the Democratic Republic of the Congo (1,747km).\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_the_Central_African_Republic It appears likely that the conflict in the C.A.R. also affects Chad's interior affairs, by border crossing of C.A.R.'s refugees, impact on trade and availability of food staples, ethnic conflicts imported, similar allegations of attempted vote rigging by the C.A.R.'s blueprint, and even outbreaks of violence before, during, and after the scheduled election. Sticking to the election date during this civil war-like circumstance in C.A.R. appears to be irresponsible, unrealistic and even provocative. UN peacekeeping missions, I imagine, will do everything in their power to prevent a similar situation in Chad in the making, and will try to influence decision makers to suspend the election indefinitely.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chadian_Civil_War_(2005%E2%80%932010) The 2021 Chadian presidential election, scheduled for 01 [EDIT:11] April 2021, could be a good indicator of whether any election in Chad will be canceled due to CoViD-19, however, the 2021 presidential election is widely seen as a formal farce intended to elect the incumbent Idriss D\u00e9by, who \"presided over the removal of constitutional limits to his rule\", for a sixth term in office.
