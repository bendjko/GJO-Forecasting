Numbers mostly stable or increasing.\n2. Needs to deliver 65.2k to hit 250k, which is about 36% of the average for the past 2 quarters. Seems highly unlikely that deliveries would be hit this hard, biggest shock was about 30% (Q4 2018 to Q1 2019).\n3. Tesla states that it is still ramping up models 3/Y production in it's factory in Shanghai, and planning to ramp up production for S/X. If this happens, it's likely that production numbers will increase, so the upper bracket should be higher than the 182k mentioned before. Let's say Tesla manages to increase it's throughput of installed capacity from ~70% (182.7k in a quarter / 1050000 per year) to 75% (196.9k), the upper bracket should be 196.9 + 184.8 = 381.7\n4.

Currently, Tesla is producing vehicles in their factory in Fremont, California, and their Gigafactory in \nShanghai (\u201cAbout Tesla\u201d). Tesla\u2019s 2020 Q4 report states that Tesla delivered 499,550 vehicles in 2020 (\u201cTesla Q4\u201d). By the end of Q2 they had delivered 184,944 vehicles (\u201cQ2 2020 Update\u201d). Tesla anticipates that 270,000 Model 3s will be produced in Shanghai in 2021. This is approximately 22,500 model 3s per month produced in China, totaling around 135,000 cars produced in Q1 and Q2 in China alone (\u201cTesla Gigafactory Shanghai\u201d). Al Root, writing for Barron\u2019s, shares that Tesla\u2019s vehicle production has risen 71% year over year in the fourth quarter, leading an analyst to support the claim that 870,000 deliveries are possible for 2021. \u201cWall Street analysts on average project deliveries of 797,000, up another 60% compared with 2020. More sales and production in China along with initial Cybertruck sales in the U.S. should propel sales in the new year\u201d (Root). Tesla is also building plants to add additional production capacity: a Gigafactory in Germany, expected \nto open in summer 2021 (Schmitz), and Gigafactory Texas, located in Austin and expected to open in \nMay 2021 (Lambert). Given these numbers, I predict that there is a 0% chance that they will deliver fewer than 150,000 vehicles in the first two quarters. There is a 5% chance they will deliver 150,000-250,000 vehicles. There is a 45% chance they will deliver 250,000-350,000. There is a 50% chance they will deliver more than 350,000 vehicles.

However, considering that in order to hit or exceed the 350,000 target the company would have to deliver a minimum of 175,000 in Q1 and Q2 - a lesser number than Q4 of 2020 -, I felt bold enough to predict that there is a 80% probability they will deliver 350,000 or more vehicles, a 20% chance they will deliver more than 250,000 but less than 350,000, and a 0% probability they will deliver 250,000 vehicles or less.

If Covid suddenly caused more issues next year, by taking the worst quarter you would get a production of 164,000. So if you remove Covid from the equation for the moment, the question becomes what will demand for Teslas do in the next six months. Annualising 2020 YTD you get 425,000, and that includes two covid affected quarters, but you could argue that Q3 deliveries were inflated as a result. 425,000 deliveries is probably very conservative, as in their late October investor call they were still optimistic they had a chance of hitting 500,000, so 475k as a baseline seems fair. 475k annualised would imply a 47% increase in sales to get to 350, a 5% increase to 250 and a 37% drop in sales to get to 150,000, in a very short time period (June 21) . Happy to rule out 150k, but will allocate 2% for some extreme circumstances, egregious fraud/safety issues etc.\n150-250k assumes up to only 5% growth. Given the company has been gearing up for \"in the vicinty\" 850k to 1m deliveries in 2021 (investor call oct 20), and you would expect them to have decent visibility over the next 6 months of demand, I will attribute 8% (+3% for an aggressive resurgence of Covid that impacts production materially).\nTurning to the most bullish case, 350k assumes that the company's growth and production play out as they expect without anything going wrong. So taking those assumptions of 180k deliveries in q4, that would equate to 360k in H1 21. In the US market, given delivery times are being pushed out until Mar 21 for some models that would suggest this is feasible, but demand in China and Europe seems to be stagnating. But stagnating does not mean dropping and the US is still the most important market so I will allocate 33% to this case.\nLeaving 54% for the remaining case."], [34815, "2020-12-10T08:25:55Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [88098, "2020-12-10T01:55:32Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5], ""], [88002, "2020-12-09T21:19:44Z", [0.02, 0.1, 0.55, 0.33], ""], [73050, "2020-12-09T21:08:56Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.75, 0.15], ""], [73050, "2020-12-09T21:05:20Z", [0.05, 0.25, 0.55, 0.15], ""], [96791, "2020-12-09T17:55:54Z", [0.01, 0.66, 0.32, 0.01], ""], [48709, "2020-12-09T17:33:44Z", [0.6, 0.3, 0.05, 0.05], ""], [49526, "2020-12-09T14:44:49Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.7, 0.15], ""], [14266, "2020-12-09T07:38:52Z", [0.0, 0.2, 0.55, 0.25], ""], [31275, "2020-12-08T23:57:27Z", [0.0, 0.26, 0.55, 0.19], ""], [88875, "2020-12-08T23:43:33Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "I drive Tesla and EV will boost in Europe"], [96915, "2020-12-08T21:47:12Z", [0.0, 0.25, 0.6, 0.15], ""], [29119, "2020-12-08T21:15:54Z", [0.01, 0.02, 0.95, 0.02], ""], [1333, "2020-12-08T18:47:35Z", [0.23, 0.31, 0.36, 0.1], ""], [86770, "2020-12-08T18:12:47Z", [0.02, 0.15, 0.45, 0.38], "at the moment of forecast, Q4 sales were not known but there were hints that it could be extremely well and near to 200k units, boosted by M3.

According to a number of different sources EV demand growth is expected to remain intact indicating that if there is supply it will be sold. There are of course a number of complicating factors as more supply in the market coming from Volkswagen, the Chinese players etc., but for now I am assuming that the brand power of Tesla will attract enough demand.

If they were able to produce that full capacity that would be 420k per half year or 210k per quarter. Q3 this year they delivered 140k (which could be partly from coronavirus delays). In Q3 2019 their listed annual capacity was 590k. That would have been 295k units over the first half of the year. Dividing their actual first half deliveries by capacity is 180k/295k, which is 0.61.
