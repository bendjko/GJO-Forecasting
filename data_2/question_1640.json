In 2020, Trump is presiding over an economy in recession and a failed ability in controlling the pandemic and Joe Biden I believe understands and is more in touch with Pennsylvania voters' concerns than Clinton. All this makes me conclude that Pennsylvania in 2020 will be less a swing state as shown with Outside but more a likely Democratic Presidential state as expressed with Inside.
