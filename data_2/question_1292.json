Therefore, it is very unlikely that there would be a confrontation IN Iran.  (>5%)   It is more likely that the naval vessels would have a confrontation, give the Persian Gulf is not that wide and both powers have war ships in the area.   Iran has already attacked a Saudi oil installation.   However, they denied it.  If Iran wanted a war, they would have admitted responsibility.  Hence, despite the attack, they do not seem all that excited about having a confrontation at sea.  Yet, their warships are clearly close enough to each other  every day to attack.  Right now, they are not attacking each other so it would require some sort of change in circumstances before Iran attacked.   I do not see this happening because the Saudis could respond by sinking their oil tankers.  This is probably why, despite the presence of so many warships from so many countries hostile to each other, it rarely happens.

The crown prince is however promoting a more aggressive form of Saudi nationalism less rooted in Islam, which probably enhances the previous probability by some factor: I will assume a factor of 2, giving a new 3.4% per year of direct conflict. However, as the possibility of Iran retaking the development of nuclear weapons increases, I would say that Saudi Arabia will be hard pressed to eventually do a preemptive attack if the US decides not to intervene. That will probably generate a larger probability during the next few years (or even the next few months). Now with the recent attack there will be too a further enhance probability. If I take a factor of 4 or 5, this gives me 14.8-18.5%, which in a period of 1.5 months approaches a 2% probability of a direct conflict.

Saudi Arabia needs to find an actor to blame the attack on and needs to retaliate to save face internationally and domestically, however Iran's use of proxies gives them a way to save face and avoid direct confrontation with Iran [1]. Seeing as US government officials and Trump used equally harsh rhetoric on NK and military confrontation has been avoided and Trump just ousted Bolton, who was well known for his hawkish opinions on Iran, it is highly unlikely that the US will back the Saudi's militarily against Iran in the next 2 months, should the Saudi's conclude Iran was behind the attack and decided to retaliate militarily.

The damage to the oil and gas infrastructure has not been as catastrophic as first thought, and seems that the production will be back online fairly quickly. There is also the fact that a retaliatory strike would not have to be escalatory - the KSA could attack Iranian oil infrastructure, it does not have to attack military targets in Iran.

[1] However, despite its arch rival temporarily knocking out half of its oil production in a swift blow, I think it extremely unlikely that Saudi Arabia will retaliate against Iran unless it is reassured it has the strong backing of the U.S. - namely, that the U.S. is itself prepared to intervene militarily. Saudi Arabia is certainly aware that Iran's military is on its level and might even be stronger [2] so it will wait and see what the U.S. position is. The U.S. position is wildcard here. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo came out swinging immediately after the attacks took place by publicly blaming Iran [3] - apparently before all the facts were clear, since a U.S. forensics team sent to investigate had not yet arrived [4] and Saudi Arabia just today publicly released information on the debris of the drones/missiles used, which they said showed that the attack was clearly sponsored by Iran. In today's press conference the Saudis also stopped short of claiming that the attacks were launched from Iranian soil [5, 6] - meaning they are clearly not eager to retaliate immediately, otherwise they would've blamed Iran directly already. However, Secretary of State Pompeo today called the Iranian attack an \"act of war.\" [7] - and yet Trump himself has not publicly blamed Iran and has instead indicated that he will wait to see what 1) Saudi Arabia says and 2) what the results of further investigations are [8]. Also, Trump just ousted his national security advisor John Bolton - an Iran hawk who apparently clashed with the President quite often - and just today named a new, more mainstream national security advisor. [9] Finally - and crucially - reports are emerging that Pentagon officials are urging the White House to show restraint in its response. [10] So, there are a couple of key signs from the U.S. indicate that it is not seriously preparing itself to intervene militarily on behalf of Saudi Arabia if Saudi Arabia chooses to retaliate. The main one is that President Trump has shown himself to be averse to starting new wars. True, he is warm toward Saudi Arabia and his recent \"locked and loaded\" rhetoric may seem telling, but consider that he previously extended even more bellicose threats of war to North Korea - \"fire and fury\" - that is, before Trump met Kim Jong Un and then \"fell in love.\" Trump does not want to get involved in anotherwar, and the Pentagon is also apparently cautioning against it. Moreover, Trump has a new, presumably less hawkish, national security advisor. However, there are still a few signs that the probability a retaliatory attack should not be discounted: there is Secretary of State Pompeo's saber-rattling, a need by Saudi Arabia to show strength after this humiliating attack, and unconfirmed reports that Saudi planes have struck Iranian targets in Syria [11].  All in all, conflict is improbable but not insignificantly so. I do not have a base rate of whether such types of attacks have previously lead to conflicts between the two parties involved, so this determination has mostly been made on the basis of geopolitical considerations particular to this case.
