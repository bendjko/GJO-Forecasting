The Liberals appear to have arrested the Tories' momentum and pulled back into a tie or lead, depending on the poll. While the PPC's earlier gains seemed to come from non-voters, Greens, and undecideds, in the past 10 days it seems to have pulled from the Tory vote. (Just looking at CBC's poll tracker and 338).  13% of Canadians are undecided - they're not super likely to vote, but the data shows they don't look kindly on the Tories - probably a vaguely Liberal / NDP / Green mix. So if there's above average turnout, I suspect it could provide an advantage to the Liberals. (Link below) Reasons for no Liberal majority: \n- Primary: Polling range does not support a majority, statistically, as reflected by the CBC and 338. Plausible, but unlikely.\n- Potential Surprise: While I don't believe there are any \"shy\" Tories at this point - the party has moved further centre - but PPC voters could chicken out in the face of another Trudeau gov't and vote Conservative instead. \n- Potential Surprise: NDP could scoop up some more disaffected Liberal voters, though this seems unlikely as the NDP don't seem to have built up any momentum this election. \n- Potential Surprise: Liberal voters stay home. Left-of-centre Canadians generally seem more concerned about COVID and Canadians generally seem unhappy about the election being called. However with the real possibility of a Tory gov't, this does not seem highly likely.  Reasons for a Liberal majority:\n- Primary: PPC continues to peel voters off from the Tories, esp. with provincial Tory gov'ts putting vaccine mandates / passports in place in Ontario and Alberta\n- Potential Surprise: NDP wild card again - maybe support dries up from (1) Covid keeping their voters at home, (2) Liberals pushing leftward, and (3) threat of a Tory gov't drives some voters back to the Liberals. Again, the polls don't seem to be showing this and this election's Tories are left of their average making them less of a boogeyman to NDP voters, but it's certainly a potential avenue to a Liberal majority. \n- Potential Surprise: Undecideds turn up and vote Liberal.

Meanwhile, national support is holding strong at about 20% for the left-wing New Democrats - another option for progressive voters - and the Bloc Quebecois, which only runs candidates in Quebec and is polling in second place behind the Liberals in the vote-rich battleground province.\n\n=> Though none of this is good news for the Liberals, the election is \"by no means done\" For example, issues like climate change or childcare are matters that Trudeau is attacking the Conservatives on.   the Liberals unveiled a campaign platform  - on Wednesday , Sep 1- promising billions in new spending, with Trudeau urging voters to help the Liberals \"finish the hard work\" of the past six years on matters like climate change and reconciliation with indigenous people in Canada.
