In essence: Currently 8 states over 5%.  Of these, 5 seem sure to stay above 5%, given very slow declines over the last month (Con, Mass, NH, NJ, & NY). 3 are more borderline (Mich, RI, Penn). So I fired up the spreadsheet to look at these more closely. Michigan: The track record for Michigan is almost ruler-straight decline over the last month by ~0.05%/day. Extrapolating this forward to resolution date gives 5.6%.  RI: If you stare at the graph you can persuade yourself the rate of decline has accelerated recently. If you crudely model this with a quadratic fit and extrapolate forward you get ~4.3% at question close. (Or being more basic: it was 5.7% at the start of last month, 5.3% at the start of this one, so ~4.9% at the start of the next). Penn: Similar to Mitchigan, very straight declines (~0.05%/day). So extrapolating out gives ~5.2% To drop into the lowest bucket, 2 of these states need to decline faster than these projections. They don't have to go much faster, and there's a fair forecast error (drawing lines on time series is the opposite of robust technique), but still feels fairly unlikely, ergo some fractional tightening. I expect to be looking carefully over the next weeks to see if the expected rates are lining up. (Several states are showing fractional upticks in their CFR over the last couple of weeks. None of these are likely to add any 'new' states into the 5%+ bracket, but if the mechanism is right censoring (i.e. you only find out later how many cases survive) it could somewhat slow the decline in CFR in places which diagnosed more cases ~a month ago then they are doing now.)"], [38094, "2020-08-02T23:46:29Z", [0.3, 0.7, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "And why wasn't Puerto Rico added to this chart?

However, I believe the current number of infections is also under-counted, and at a higher rate. I am not a denier of Covid-19 and I believe it is serious.  In, fact, I do not believe schools should reopen in august for in-person classes.   This question is VERY hard to predict because the concept of the spread of the disease and its prevalence is not directly related to the amount of testing.  Looking at the chart many of the states that have the highest fatality rate were those hardest-hit earliest. We know deaths lag by 3--5 weeks, at least, after a spike in new cases is observed.  However, with the most recent problem areas infections in younger people seem more prevalent, as well as more testing overall, which both lower the measured fatality rate.   I have zero confidence that the overall disease spread will be tempered between now and September 1.  In fact, I expect it to be worse nationally then.  However, if we can sustain the same testing rates we currently have (if not improve them) I believe the measured fatality rate will go down, even though (shamefully) the number of fatalities could easily be at 250,000 by September 1.

Test positivity ratios are generally increasing, which typically means worsening case ascertainment, and so inflating (observed, crude) CFR above the IFR of (typically) 1%. On this story (and if you assume the epidemic will continue to grow over the next couple of months) you would expect more states to cross 5% than the current 12.   Yet, at least according to our world in data[1], crude CFR has been *declining* in the US as a whole since mid May. Moreover, when I check previous captures of the page we are forecasting, CFRs have been incrementing down over most states over the last 8 days or so. When I compare previous captures and do extremely dumb linear extrapolation, 3 of the states >5% now will fall below 5% at resolution (Ind, Ken, OH), the others remain ~stable, and none currently below 5% rise above it.  There are manifold general corrections which are relevant (e.g. right censoring, changes in testing trends, seasonality, reporting protocols, and latencies galore), as well as closer analysis of particular states. In aggregate they point to increasing CFRs. Engaging mechanistically, though, I think there's a stronger consideration pointing in the opposite direction: the 'inflation' you get from undertesting is non-linear, as severe cases are preferentially tested. As a benchmark. Wuhan near the peak of its epidemic (with, to my understanding, testing mostly limited to those presenting with symptoms, ICU/hospital capacity problems, so on) still did not report a CFR >5%. Even fairly indifferent testing regimes may be sufficient to 'dilute' fatalities with cases to reduce CFR < 5%, as *hospital fatality rates* can be lower than this.[2] Thus a Simpson's paradox-esque story: although prevalence outstrips testing, the testing increases are sufficient to reveal proportionately more of the 'sub-clinical' (or just 'sub-lethal') iceberg to drive down crude CFR (as a further paradox, states which are losing control of their epidemics stand a *better* chance of reducing their CFR below 5% than those which are bringing it under control - hence why CFR is a treacherous metric).  [Aside, toy example: Suppose 1000 infections, 10 deaths (IFR 1%), and 1000 tests at test positivity of 1%. Presuming you test all the deaths first, then use the remainder randomly on the population, you get 10 cases from the deaths, and find ~10 non-fatal, so a CFR of ~50%. Suppose the epidemic increases by an order of magnitude in size whilst your testing merely doubles (so test positivity is now 10%, IFR unchanged). So now 100 cases from the deaths, plus ~290 other cases, so the CFR has fallen from 1/2 to 1/3.]   However, bitter experience teaches dumb numerical models often do better than people trying to vaguely weigh up qualitative considerations in their head (especially for COVID, the numbers seem to be often gravity-defying by my intuition). Thus I'll mostly stick with the dumb extrapolation, and add more snapshots over the next few weeks to detect trend reversal (and assess forward prediction for intermediate times). I might also kick the tires more on my 'simpsons paradox' story (i.e. how well do increases in aggregate testing rates explain declines in CFR), and if so refine the forecast looking at the 12 or so states (+ any borderlines). Hopefully I'll quickly correct any overconfidence.

Of course, the more people you have Infected, the harder it is to confirm numbers of infection, meaning the infection fatality case rate will go up. But as test supplies become more limited, this will also impact the number in this set of data.  In other words, we are measuring our ability to evaluate the situation, not the situation itself.
