For the booster, Pfizer released data on July 8th and stated they submit early August. ~August 10th seems to be the exact comp, pretty close to the September 1 date.

This is the strongest piece of info I think we have.\n2) Framing of the question would seem to support CDC/FDA approval for just immunocompromised people - like cancer survivors and transplant recipients. Data seems to strongly suggest these populations need boosters. I could imagine pressure for this group working separately than a broader approval for elderly/everyone Thoughts in favor of after 9/1\n1) Surgeon General just stated \"you don't need to go out and get a booster shot\". Feels like a whipsaw to then approve it within 1 month\n2) FDA is just balancing more questions than it was before. Should they do a full approval (more important for getting everyone vaccinated), approve for kids (important for schools opening), etc.... The prior timeline was when it was the most important question before them. \n3) This Booster is not targeted at Delta. Pfizer is separately doing clinical trials for a Delta specific booster. Given the virility of Delta I wonder if there will be pressure to wait for data from that trial\n4) Public health officials are very focused on getting more unvaccinated people vaccinated. Most competition for vaccines could make that harder. \n5) US using more vaccines internally means fewer shots for the rest of the world. Optics issue with foreign policy + ethical ramifications.

Importantly, approval for a \"booster\" grants permission to use the vaccine on a periodic basis (e.g. every 10 years for tetanus boosters).  2) Alternatively, Pharma companies may apply for a change to their emergency use authorizations for their COVID vaccines, such as to change their vaccine from a two-dose to a three-dose label. It that happens, the 3rd dose isn't a \"booster\", it's a 3rd dose. [Think about it this way: the 2nd dose of Pfizer isn't a booster; it's a second dose.] Either of the above will likely be referred to as \"boosters\" in the press, confusing matters.  *What about \"fully vaccinated\"? *\nHere's another issue: If the FDA changes the authorization of Pfizer (for example) to a 3-dose label, or the CDC makes a 3rd dose recommended for some people, then they have also changed the definition of what \"fully vaccinated\" means. People can get a 3rd does, but now they aren't \"fully vaccinated\" until after they received the 3rd dose.  So my question is: Should this question resolve as \"Yes\" or \"No\" if the CDC recommends a third dose but without specifying that it's a booster?

First, I'll say that it seems certain that boosters will be necessary, so the question in my mind is \"when?\", not if. However the timing is far from clear to me. From a practical standpoint I think a lot of Americans have or will soon realize that they will have better protection with a third (or second depending on the vaccine) shot. There is also some ambiguity in the question: would changing Pfizer's approval from a 2-dose to a 3-dose regime count as a \"booster\". I would say \"no\" from a scientific standpoint but who knows how the GJOpen folks would score that. I'll ask. Apparently, increasing the doses is more likely in the short run than approving a booster. For the shorter buckets, I think the issues are practical and public-health oriented (i.e. political). Factors that will affect timing: \n1) for one of the major vaccines to get approved: application submitted by vaccine maker + time to approve. Fauci: \u201cWe\u2019re a long way from that.\u201d [1] I'm going to say that's >3 months\n2) the wild card here is approval of a delta-variant-specific booster. That scenario could be fast, and at least one is in trials. [1]\n3) \"Deciding to add a third shot to the Pfizer series comes with all sorts of other opportunity costs, too \u2014 including further delaying access to vaccine for low- and middle-income countries. \" => I don't know how much this will affect the thinking of US health officials. My guess is that it will only to the extent that they believe that it will affect the expected health outcomes of Americans. I believe that at the margin, that will cause them to err a little on the side of waiting.\n4) How much will news of delta variant spike put political pressure on the FDA to act? I'm not sure, but in the past they have appeared to largely ignore political pressure. \n5) there will be a wave of people who were vaccinated in Mar - May who will have waning immunity by around 6 months later (Sep - Nov) and those folks will start getting COVID in larger numbers and with greater severity. That will put some real pressure on the system to move. \n6) finally, I think there's a bit of wishful thinking here. I\u2019m sure many forecasters would love for boosters to be approved sooner ... because it makes scientific sense and because they want to be protected and protect their loved ones. Unfortunately I think it will take longer.  My take on all of this is that the short bucket is unlikely and I'm split between Sept - Dec.

He added that FDA is also exploring all possible regulatory routes that could provide additional access to vaccines in situations where data suggests that benefits outweigh the risks. https://www.politico.com/newsletters/prescription-pulse/2021/07/23/cdc-advisers-hold-off-on-covid-booster-shot-call-796674\n"], [90237, "2021-07-25T06:01:49Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [101288, "2021-07-25T03:27:30Z", [0.65, 0.2, 0.08, 0.07], "According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_dose, there are relatively few booster vaccines.

Furthermore, there has been data from Israel's Public Health Ministry that states that certain vaccines are relatively ineffective against the Delta variant (39% VE), which may signal a greater need for boosters. However, this should also be considered in context with contrasting UK studies. I think that there is a significant chance that a booster is approved in the coming month, especially with the CDC and White House commenting on the matter.

The vaccines have continued to show strong protection against variants, though slightly reduced. However, immunocompromised people throws a wrench into things, as other commenters have pointed out. I think though that there's a decent chance the FDA and CDC may not officially recommend immunocompromised people get a third shot without further study. [1] and [2] are informative on this. Especially the following quote from [2]: \"...the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices cannot recommend that until the Food and Drug Administration gives full approval to the currently available vaccines or amends its emergency use authorization. The FDA\u2019s existing authorization permits only a two-dose regimen of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, or a single dose of the Johnson & Johnson product.\" But there may be ways around that. Again from [2]: \"Amanda Cohn, the CDC\u2019s chief medical officer for vaccine policy, said the agency is exploring options to make additional doses possible for such patients. 'I think what you\u2019re asking about is, you know, is there a way to offer a third dose to individuals \u2026 through a study, or through an investigational new drug format for this population? I will just say that we are actively looking into ways that could be done to potentially provide access earlier than any potential change in regulatory decisions,' Cohn told panel members.\" So the first part of that, a study, would be slow. The CDC and FDA are generally cautious (too cautious in my opinion as they've demonstrated throughout the pandemic), so it's a definite possibility they go that route. But if they took option two and did an investigational new drug format that could be pretty fast. And there's precedent for that as well. In 2013 the CDC recommended use of an unapproved vaccine at Princeton university due to a meningococcal outbreak [3]. If the above doesn't happen or they opt for a slower approach through a study, I think a booster shot recommendation is pretty unlikely by the end of the year. I think the most likely scenario would be that they recommend a second dose of Johnson and Johnson, or even an mRNA booster for J&J because J&J is the least effective of the three approved (and my impression is that it's less effective by a decent margin). One factor in this is that recommending a booster makes the vaccine hesitant even less likely to want the vaccine. That would just reinforce the misconception among the hesitant that the vaccines aren't effective or that it's futile to get the vaccine because you'll just need another dose every 6 months and then people associate it with the much less effective flu vaccine. Overall I'm giving a 75% chance of a booster recommendation by the end of the year primarily due to the potential for a recommendation specifically for immunocompromised people.

Need to balance that with encouraging the recurring revenue shot (how best to leverage fear amongst the already fearful.)\n- As more of these high profile COVID cases are documented amongst the vaxxed, it becomes necessary for Gov to have a position.  That the vax doesn\u2019t work won\u2019t fly.  Need a booster cuz new strain!\n- Will the PCR test use cycle counts up or down?

Instill more fear in moms. Beyond my meager thoughts, here is a relevant statement: (https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-covid-19-cases-united-states-almost-all-among-people-unvaccinated/) \"Both the FDA and CDC said no on Friday; the fully vaccinated \"do not need a booster at this time.\"  But both Pfizer and BioNtech officials announced they were seeking emergency-use authorization for a booster because antibody levels in the blood may decline six months after immunization, though studies dispute that, and leading physicians are counseling a go-slow approach.\"   So, I conclude that since: - I think they need to encourage the booster before announcing the next variant.  Take advantage of the Delta hype.\n- Trump rammed the vaccines through in his term - Biden will need to do the same with the booster to show leadership parity.\n- March and April were the peak months for the jab, that would put us at Sep/Oct for the 6-month recommendation and gives enough time for Pharma to get their emergency use authorization through.  They will go full-force in this timeframe.\n- But, I believe the booster will be recommended for at least the \"immunocompromised\" in August.  Get the public warmed up to the idea before full-court press and take advantage of the influx of Delta variant cases. 75% Before Sep 1 / 25% Sep 1 - Oct 31"], [767, "2021-07-23T18:33:16Z", [0.0, 0.4, 0.3, 0.3], ""], [1333, "2021-07-23T18:12:58Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [60695, "2021-07-23T18:00:43Z", [0.0, 0.4, 0.6, 0.0], ""], [100184, "2021-07-23T17:38:58Z", [0.29, 0.5, 0.2, 0.01], ""], [88452, "2021-07-23T17:21:54Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""]], "open_date": "2021-07-23T17:00:52Z", "close_date": "2021-08-13T02:00:28Z"}
