Even if the paperwork has not been completed, if we assume that the English law rule applies the written document only acts as evidence that the verbal agreement was made. (I have no idea if EU law uses the same assumption.) An observation; one reason for the Brexit mess is that hardly anyone is thinking strategically, all the effort is being put into tactics. What does BJ really want? He says he wants his cake but to be able to eat it too, but what exactly does that mean? He says he wants to do wonderful trade deals with non-EU countries. That sounds fine, but what countries is he talking about? What goods and services does he think trade could be improved in? What evidence is there that these other counties want trade deals that would benefit the UK? BJ's trade advisors have said that their vision of free trade would lead to a decline of UK manufacturing and agriculture, and that the UK should be a provider of services. What services?  What jobs would the former agricultural and manufacturing works do? Unless we know what types of jobs these displaced workers will do, how can the retraining start? The whole Brexit idea seems to be based on the EU being a problem that is holding back the UK and if the EU is removed that will automatically improve the UK, and no one need spend time or effort on figuring out how. \nIts a similar to the ideas of the Neoconservatives regarding Iraq; get rid of Saddam Hussein and some how the middle east will sort itself out. No need to worry about how, it will happen by itself. It didn't. \nA good Brexit requires a well thought out deliverable destination, and then a strategy on how to get to the destination. BJ does not do plans, he does tactics and opportunities.  The opposition are no better. Corbyn's message seems to be vote for me because I am a good person and I will do good things, they must be good because I am a good person. Anything that I do that does not appear good, only appears not to be good because you are failing to see the good. \n"], [70711, "2019-10-28T10:29:38Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [70711, "2019-10-28T10:27:50Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.6, 0.4, 0.0], ""], [59882, "2019-10-28T10:25:31Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], "The EU has agreed to the UK goverenment's request for an extension; https://twitter.com/eucopresident/status/1188748108764721152"], [691, "2019-10-28T10:13:36Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.99, 0.01, 0.0], ""], [78343, "2019-10-28T10:02:05Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], "Happened"], [784, "2019-10-28T09:56:09Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.9, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [32438, "2019-10-28T09:55:03Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [32438, "2019-10-28T09:54:41Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.95, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [49149, "2019-10-28T09:40:41Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [67609, "2019-10-28T09:38:55Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], "Apparently the EU has already agreed on the extension, though the decision has not been formalized in a written procedure.

On Monday the PM will try and get a GE via the Fixed Term Parliament Act (which requires a 2/3 majority). Its not clear that if he wins the vote that he will legally set the date for the GE, because the FTPA allows the PM to then choose the date. I am pretty sure he would choose 12 Dec, but legally he would probably not do so until the EU had extended A50. But the PM wants to link the GE to an agreement to complete the Parliamentary progress of his WA Bill. This would need to be completed by 6th Nov. Its very unlikely that MPs will agree the timetable for the WA Bill. So this method of getting to a GE will almost certainly will not work, if it were the date would probably not be set until after A50 had been extended.  A new idea from the LibDems and SNP is to have a Short Bill, setting aside the FTP Act that would call for a GE on 9th Dec, if A50 has been extended. This would only require a simple majority of MPs and so has more chance of becoming law because the Conservatives, LibDems and SNP have the numbers. Labour might also think they also have to support it as well. The problem for this as far a the PM is concerned is that there would not be time to pass his WA B. So this has a chance of happening (30%?) but if it is conditional on the EU agreeing to Extend A50 to 31st Jan (as the LIBDems are saying it is) then logically the A50 extension would be before the GE date is set. (i can see some argument being possible, but if we follow the normal invitation, offer, accept  sequence of a contract, then the A50 extension would be before the GE date was set.) There is also a possible time problem with this plan. It requires a complete bill to pass, it would be tight to complete by 31st Oct and any extension to A50 has to happen  by then even if the bill is incomplete. If the bill is not complete before 4th Nov the GE could not take place on 9th Dec.

The EU has not yet officially replied to BJ's request to Extend A50. \nIts possible that the EU will not give its extension reply until after the vote for a GE next week.  Bj has also offered to revise his timetable for voting on the WAB to give MPs from the 28th Oct to 6th Nov to debate and pass it. This time table is a far shorter period that MPs want/need, but in order to hold a GE on 12th Dec, Parliament needed to be dissolved on the 6th Nov.  It seems very unlikely that MPs will give BJ the 2/3 majority for a GE under FTP Act next week or to agree to BJ's new WAB time table. By next week it will be too late to get a GE by 12 Dec via a vote of No Confidence (this takes 7 weeks) but a Short Bill (setting aside the FTP Act) could be tried as this could be passed by a simple majority. The problem for BJ is that he does not have a majority, so he would need to get some opposition MPs to vote with him. In theory the SNP and LibDems want a GE, but the SNP also wants a Referendum on Scottish Independence so I would guess it would not want to annoy Labour because it will need Labours votes in future. I am not sure what the LibDems and DUP would do, but I doubt the LibDems would want to help BJ. Its also unclear what the ex-Conservative MPs would do. They may be promised to be re-admitted to the party, but many of them are retiring and may not want to help BJ. Also  the Short Bill is amendable and things that BJ does not want could be added. My guess is that BJ could try the Short Bill route. But could probably not get it passed by 31st Oct as it would need to go through all the stages of a normal bill.

Commentators are saying that some countries such as France want to short extension to allow BJ's WAB to be passed, other say that the extension will be until 31st Jan (as requested in the letter that BJ sent the EU).  I am sure that the EU wants to get Brexit resolved, but I don't see either a short extension or an extension to  31st Jan being very likely to resolve matters.  The WAB has so many problems, particularly with the section on NI, that I can't see it getting through parliament without a lot of amendments. Regarding NI any solution that does not involve the whole UK remaining in the EU Customs Union will mean either a border between NI and Ireland, or a border between NI and GB. Choosing either option will put peace in NI at risk as a border with Ireland will stir up the Nationalists, a border with GB will stir up the Unionists. Both Nationalists and Unionists are capable of violence. If the UK changes the WAB to stay in the EU Customs Union that presumably means more negotiations with the EU. If the EU extend A50 to 31st January to give time for a GE, I am not sure that MPs will vote for that to happen. Each of the ways that a GE could arise involve several weeks for campaigning, vote counting and than possibly negotiations between parties to form a new government. There is very little time get this done before Christmas/New Year. There are logistics problems having a GE in the lead up to Christmas (many of the usual polling stations may already to booked for festive events) and voters are less likely to turn out on cold, wet and dark December days, particularity older voters who tend to vote Conservative. I doubt that the public will want an election campaign over the Christmas period at all. If an election is not called until after New Year it could not be completed by 31st Jan.  A Public Vote might be added to the WAB, but this would require about 20 weeks to organize (and if BJ refused to do so, much longer.)    Obviously I am guessing, but if I was the EU I would  extend A50  for an indefinite period that included a break clause every three or six months so that when they are ready the UK could officially Leave the EU. If I were an MP I would press for a Public Vote as the only way to avoid being blamed for Brexit, which the majority of experts and voters believe will make them worse off. If the public still vote to Leave then MPs cannot be blamed (for the immediate consequences and  for the years of further negotiations that will be needed to get FTA's with the EU and other countries.) , if voters vote to Remain then Brexit would be cancelled and most people would be glad that its over (if in doubt check the Polls, most people think voting for Brexit was a mistake.)

I assume after the PM tries to pass a meaningful vote, the Speaker, Mr. Bercow, will block such a motion, but also that, whether the govternment's motion is allowed or blocked, some form of Letwin will ensure that there is a high likelihood of an extension to Article 50. There are sound legal reasons for the EU extending article 50: Gina Miller in a legal paper pointed out \u2013 \u201cthe wording of article 50(3) presupposes that the European council take the decisive lead with the consent of the withdrawing member state\u201d. Secondly, 'the EU has a legal duty to all its member states to ensure that any such withdrawal is not damaging to what article 13(1) of the treaty on European Union calls the \u201cconsistency, effectiveness and continuity of its policies and actions\u201d, or to the principle spelled out in article 13(2): \u201cPursuant to the principle of sincere cooperation the EU and the member states shall, in full mutual respect, assist each other in carrying out the tasks which flow from the treaties.\u201d' (https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/03/gina-miller-eu-delay-brexit-no-deal). The economic consequences of a hard Brexit will be massive. Consequently, I believe that the EU will grant, if needed, an extension to article 50. As I write, Mr. Bercow is speaking (https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/oct/21/brexit-johnson-to-push-for-deal-as-labour-woos-rebel-tories-eu-extension-live-news) and has just blocked the government's motion. Given Labour's concerns over withdrawal agreement Mr. Johnson has negotiated, and the concerns of the DUP and others, and the vast chasm between the opposition and the government on matters related to a custom's union and a confirmatory referendum, the EU will likely have to grant an extension. In the least, there is so little time left to get on with it. There is no majority for a second referendum as things stand. Mr. Johnson cannot achieve Brexit without an election, but, as recent polling indicates, he is unlikely to win an election without Brexit (https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/uknews/boris-johnson-will-only-win-a-general-election-if-brexit-is-delivered-by-31-october-poll-suggests/ar-AAICVfG), so his endgame is Brexit, deal or no deal. Yet, a \"People v Parliament\" election (https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/boris-johnson-lays-ground-for-people-v-politicians-general-election-tf9v7nkg5) could win him a majority, in my mind, and he may gamble that he has done enough to hurt the Brexit Party and his messaging and the manner in which he asked for an extension of article 50, suggest that that is his thinking (https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/18/boris-johnson-charms-parliament-brexit-election-050700) and he will call for a general election to Get Brexit Done.

Then a public vote of on the WA and the FTR. Then (if the public agreed) an implementation period started. \nThis is more or less what the sequence that was supposed be. All I have added is the Public Vote and that what was called the Future Framework is worked up into a legal text. The reason for adding the Public Vote is that the 2016 referendum was a vote to change the UK relationship to the EU, without clarity on what relationship the public wanted. The reason for making the FTR a legal document is that without legal certainty the public can't be sure where the UK relationship will finish up.  (With BJ as PM many are suspicious that the FTA will not be agreed because many Conservative Breiteers prefer what the Brexit Party wants, and the BJ deal is just a means of getting there.) The reason for starting the implementation period after both the WA and FTR become law, is that until the final destination has being agreed its not possible to start implementing it.   For example if the final FTR needs specific technological solutions and has staffing training and recruitment implications for governments and businesses, \"implementing\"  can't be done before you know what these are, and probably can't even be planned for until you know what they are. I am not expecting this to happen because it seems there is less political interest in successful outcomes than in taking bold leaps into the dark. The list of screwed up projects that the UK has started in the last few decades that have spectacularly failed because of the urge to \"do something bold\" without first working out if the project could ever work or the details and cost of doing it.  Example include lots of computer systems such as those for the NHS that cost billions before being scrapped, railway project that were started, stopped, restarted and stopped again, that were either not completed and/or way over budget. Universal Credit; a good idea that was not thought through, and was badly designed. Heathrow airport expansion never started because (like Brexit) is contradicts itself (any expansion will increase pollution in a heavily populated area.)   Joining in many wars in the middle east with no clear idea of what they were supposed to achieve, let alone a plan for achieving anything.   I agree with @esenechal that the EU will not refuse an A50 Extension if the withdrawal legislation is not passed by 31st Oct. It rather funny that the UK government says on one hand that the EU will refuse to extend because they are fed up with the UK (and who could blame them), and that a No Deal outcome would hurt the EU more than the UK. So the Government claims to think that the EU would do itself a lot of harm rather than delay Brexit for 3 months. After the time wasted by the UK so far what does another few months matter?

MPs have pointed out that seems to be against the rules of the house. However in relation to this forecast; it seems BJ should request the extension to A50 now as he does not seem to be putting his deal in front of MPs today. I am assuming he will do it. It is not clear when or what the EU would do about this.  The Letwin Amendment is that MPs cannot fully agree that the BJ deal will happen before they have examined, debated and passed the WA.   The passing of the Letwin Amendment gives some clue as to how MPs would vote on the WA, but Letwin himself says he will vote For the WA, while it is assumed most MPs who voted for the Letwin Amendment would probably vote Against the WA. My guess is that all who would reject BJ's deal voted for the Amentment (which got 322 votes), If as we know at least some who voted for the Amendment intend to vote for the WA it seems likely that BJ would get the Commons to vote for the WA, but as the Amendment only got 306 there seem to be 16 MPs who did not vote on the Amendment. So one question is; is there time to pass the WA before 31st Oct? My guess is that to debate the whole of the WA and getting it passed would probably be difficult but not impossible to do in 2 weeks.

They vary according to different sources and I find myself having no clear idea of how many Tory and Labour potential rebels there are, which means that my numbers are not expected to be accurate, but mostly a ballpark estimate. For the probable outcome of the vote, I will use [1], which seems to be a good source. For the \"moving parts\" of the vote, I will use this twitter post [2]. From [1] a base case scenario is: 318 yes, 321 no Now we remove the \"moving parts\" of the voting process: this include 21 Tory rebels (or maybe 22-23, actually it's not that important) from the yes, 10 DUP MPs from the no, 25 Tory MPs from the ERG (again, sometimes they are counted as 28) from the yes, and 22 moving-piece Labour MP's ([1] counts 7 as yes, 15 as no). Outcome: 265 yes, 295 no And now comes the probability calculation, the most important piece: (i) the crucial factor (as we will see) is the DUP, whether they will really vote against at the end (ii) for the Tory rebels, I will assume they will vote individually and give each of them a 90% of  probability of voting for the deal (according to Oliver Letwin [3]). This gives us a binomial voting distribution. (iii) for the Labor \"swingers\", I will also assume that they will vote individually (probably incorrect, but also probably irrelevant), with a 0.3 probability of voting for the deal. The binomial distribution peaks at 6 yes votes, which 5 and 7 also probable, while smaller and bigger number of \"yes\" votes increasingly improbable. Actually they will be whipped, but the outcome is expected to be similar. (iv) the ERG is the most interesting piece: they vowed to vote with the DUP, but they are having doubts [4]. Two scenarios them: (iv.a) if DUP votes against, I will give the individual ERG MP will have a 30% probability of voting against and a 70% probability of voting for (I'm betting on them breaking their previous vow). Again, a binomial distribution. (iv.b) if DUP votes for, they will all vote for. With this, after crunching a few numbers, the outcome is that if the DUP votes yes the deal is approved 99.15% of the times, if the DUP votes no the deal is rejected 99.83% of the times. In short: DUP is the freaking key for the deal to pass The DUP has stated and restated that they will not vote for the deal. But they could change their minds, as this is politics. Let's say 25%. Now, if the voting fail, there is a change of a vote of no confidence, followed by a chance success of that vote, followed by a change of success of a new election, followed by a change that the date for a new election will happen before the extension is granted. We fermi it: P(GE) = P(vote of no confidence) x P(goes through) x P(set a date GE) x P(if GE, it is set before the extension is granted) I will rule out the possibility of the EU negating the extension. Not knowing how to estimate the said probabilities, I will give a 50% chance each, which gives a total of 1/16 (6.25%) of a date for a new GE set before the EU grants an extension. This is compounded of course with the base 75% probability of the vote failing, yielding a 4.7%. The rest of the probability (70%) goes to extension. Note: try to improve the estimation of the probability of the DUP changing its vote. P.S. There is a second outside view, based on how many votes has BJ won in the house of commons. From memory it seems that it has been 1 of 8, giving a 12.5% for BJ to pass the deal. Seems to be on the same ballpark than the 25% I am conceding to him. On the other hand he might try really hard, and the probability could be as high as 40 or 50%. UPDATE: I have been tinkering with the probabilities above. A few results: 1) If I made the ERG completely thrash out their vow to the DUP and vote for the deal, that will give a 6% pass probability if the DUP says no. So final probability: P_PASS = P_DUP + (1-P_DUP)*0.05 = 0.295 for P_DUP = 0.25. 2) If I reduce the probability of the Tory rebels to vote for from 0.9 to 0.8, then the probability of the deal not passing even if the DUP says yes will be 0.08 (8%). This will require a correction of the type P_PASS = P_DUP * (1 - 0.08) = 0.23 or 23% for a base probability of 25%. 3) Combining both scenarios I would arrive at a 27-28%. 4) One can play other games like modifying the voting probability for the maximum of 22 Labour that could change their votes, but we end up with the same type of bands. 5) The exception might be in the extreme cases, e.g. I make all the ERG vote for, and increase the probability of Labour \"rebels\" voting for to 0.4 (i.e. assuming between 8 and 10 Labour voting for), then I end up with a 22% probability of passing. 6) The point is again that the bulk of the probability comes down to the DUP changing its current stance, maybe corrected by factor ranging from 0.8 to 1.2 (probably not important), with the biggest corrections happening if their probability of no changing their stance is zero, [1] https://www.ft.com/content/c0c6298c-f0e6-11e9-bfa4-b25f11f42901\n[2] https://twitter.com/GoodwinMJ/status/1184842110626869248/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1184842110626869248\n[3] https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/brexit/purged-tory-grandees-preparing-to-back-boris-johnsons-brexit-deal-816352\n[4] https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/17/its-painful-to-choose-erg-locked-in-internal-talks-over-brexit-deal"], [80036, "2019-10-18T10:41:24Z", [0.0, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0, 0.3, 0.0, 0.5], ""], [172, "2019-10-18T10:33:06Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], "I\u2019m banking on Bojo not getting votes in parliament triggering extension and election in that order.

This is due on Saturday. \nAs the DUP has said they will not back the deal, and as BJ removed 21 Conservative MPs from the party BJ cannot pass the deal by relying on Government votes alone. Most of the 21 who were removed will probably vote for the deal (thus showing they were honest in saying were against No Deal not against Brexit at all. Sir Nicolas Soames and Alistair yesterday both said that BJ was not trying to negotiate a EU deal until after a meeting the 21 had with him to challenging him on the point. It seems BJ was only trying to get a deal in the last couple of weeks.) Its unclear how many Labour MPs will vote for the BJ deal, but in the past fewer Labour MPs have actually voted for the government than has been predicted before the vote. My guess is that there is about a 40% chance that the government would get the WA passed. There are at least two potential problems with the deal. There is a court hearing today in Scotland on the legality of the WA deal. The same people who got the prorogation of Parliament ruled illegal are saying that having NI apply EU customs is in conflict with a UK law.\nUnder the current law, Section 55 of the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Act 2018 prevents Northern Ireland from having difference customs rules than the rest of the UK. \nPresumably BJ would need to first change that act before agreeing the WA.\nThe same court case raises some other objections (e.g. MPs need the full legal text of WA before voting on it).\nThis could delay agreeing the WA. If the WA is delayed after Saturday of any reason BJ needs to ask for an Extension, but the EU does not need to grant it immediately or at all. So the Scottish legal action will probably not have any affect on the outcome of this question. (I will reduce my forecast a little) Another legal issue that does not (yet) seem to have come to court must surely be the consent of NI. On the face of it (to a non lawyer) the WA as it applies to NI must be a change that requires the consent of the NI Assembly before it starts, not confirmation of consent several years afterwards. If a court ruled that the NI Assembly needed to vote for the WA NI provisions that would present a major problem. The NI Assembly is not sitting, most parties in NI are against Brexit, the DUP is (or has been) pro-Brexit but is against BJ's WA deal.

While I agree the numbers are not there for the agreement to pass (at the moment) - Recognize the situation that the UK is in.  Does the UK want to continue this infighting for another three months?   Consumed by fighting in the trenches, day after day.  And like it or not this shifts the calculus for the EU as well.

Both because of the example of what happened to the Tories, and because they are desperate to retain traditional labor values going into the next election. 7.

In that case the UK will need to set dates for a referendum or a GE and this would likely need to be agreed prior to the approval for the extension. There has been some discussion around the period needed for the UK parliament to agree the current WA as it will be a very large piece of legislation - however it appears that the current negotiations are being made around the pre-existing agreement with the exception of the Irish backstop portion.

Maybe they will change their minds, but if the WA is as described in the media it would create a big problem for the DUP.\nIt might be thought that as the DUP is a party in favour of Brexit it would be keen to agree BJ's deal, but that ignores what the point of the DUP is. Without going back into Irish history its necessary to understand what the DUP's raison d'etre is. Its underlying purpose was to stop what their supporters saw as the risk of  Irish Protestants being overwhelmed by Irish Catholics. The Protestants saw themselves as British, the Catholics were seen as Irish Popests. Before the 1960s the NI Protestants controlled the NI government, police and business, but the 1960s saw the rise of protest movements in many countries where communities who felt they were being denied civil rights started agitating for their civil rights. When you increase the civil rights of one group the previously dominant group if usually not happy. \nSo the DUP raison d'etre is to stop NI becoming like Ireland. The Good Friday Agreement recognized this and gave both the Protestants and Catholics vetos on changes. \nAs far as I can understand the issue with the BJ WA is what exactly \"a change\" is. Most people in NI would see \"a change\" as being something that alters the current arrangement between NI and Ireland. The DUP sees \"a change\" as something that alters the current arrangement between NI and GB. Logically if GB itself changes (by not being in the EU and having some as yet unknown trading relationship) but NI remains aligned with Ireland and the EU, then a future change in NI to remove this alignment with the EU, this change ought to be agreed by both communities. \nAs the majority of voters in NI were not in favour of Brexit, it seems unlikely that there would be cross community consensus for NI to change what (I assume) is in the BJ WA. So the DUP would see NI's economy becoming more integrated with Ireland's and less like GB's. The inconvenience of the paper work and duties paid and maybe refunded required for NI/GB trade compared to frictionless trade between NI and Ireland (and the EU) would be certain to gradually mean NI become more like Ireland (and probable eventually lead to a united Ireland. \nSo for the DUP the long term affect of voting for BJ's WA could make the party irrelevant.

As the deal between Mrs May and EU ran to over 600 pages, (and was very difficult to read because lots of sections required that the reader read other legal documents in order to understand variations to them that the WA would entail). I can't see MPs voting on such an important document that they (or their legal advisors) have not had time to read, and that they have not had time to discuss with their constituents, by 19th Oct. \nIts possible that if BJ requests an Extension to A50 as required by the Benn Act, that the EU could delay replying to the request until they have a clear idea what the UK would use the extension for. For example they might delay replying in order to see if the UK Parliament will vote for it before the 31st Oct. If the extension had been requested but the UK Parliament then voted thru a WA, then the Extension would (probably) not happen. Given that having the UK agree a WA was supposed to happen six months before the Leaving Date it seems quite possible that the EU side will require more that two weeks to study the legal text (I am assuming that the EU 27 have some idea what Barnier might agree to, but don't have a legal text.) Some in Germany have spoken of needing an extension of two months in order to ensure the legal document is acceptable to them.    How likely it is that the UK Parliament would approve the WA is very difficult to know. From media reports it seems that BJ has offered things that the DUP has previously said were unacceptable so they may not support it, and some other Conservative MPs may not support it for the same reasons. The Conservatives are well short of a majority in Parliament (about 40 votes short) so they will need quite a few other MPs to support them. How many of the 21 MPs that BJ expelled from the Conservative Party would vote for the deal? I don't know. Some Labour MPs might vote for a deal. But I suspect that the ex-Conservative MPs and any Labour MPs who voted a a deal would only do so if Brexit was conditional of a new Public vote (obviously that would require an extension to A50, which would have to be granted before a date for referendum could be set.)     If MPs decided they did not like Bj's deal (as the opposition is almost certain to do) then they could try and kick out BJ. If they can't agree first to replace BJ with someone other than Corbyn I don't see the opposition kicking out BJ. If they did kick out BJ and get an new PM the new PM would have to get an extension to A50 before either a GE or a referendum. If BJ lost a non-confidence vote after 19th Oct if the outcome was either a new PM or a GE the extension to A50 would presumably have to take place under the Benn Act.  As the rules are that Parliament has two weeks to find a replacement PM before a GE would be called, if the two week period started after tomorrow, then it would last until after the 31st Oct. So a GE being called before 31st Oct could really only happen if 2/3rds of MPs voted for it, which seems very unlikely. Then there is the question of will a WA be agreed at all this week. \nIts all very uncertain. My Forecast of 100% extension is less that I am certain that it will happen, than the chances of any of the other options being so small that I can't put a number on them.

The rationale is as follows: (i) meeting are happening for trying to clear up what are the obstacles for a new deal,  (ii) the actitude of BJ, the Irish Taoiseach and Donald Tusk seems to be in the process of becoming more flexible and compromising, but (iii) there is a certain degree of instability in what could happen on \"Super Saturday\" (the 19th of October). For (i) and (ii) check link [1] and for (iii) check link [2], which I recommend because it contains a marvelous flow chart about the Brexit process and \"Super Saturday\".

It could be (as some reports suggest) that BJ has dropped all the red lines are just wants a deal. And that he has dropped the \"cake and eat it\" approach. A deal along the lines of Norway + staying in the EU Customs Union could (possibly) be agreed in a few days, although it sounds unlikely. It could also possibly be agreed by the UK Parliament, not with votes of the hard Brexiteers, but with votes from soft Brexit Conservative and Labour MPs. It seems possible but unlikely as Labour is now talking about agreeing a WA deal conditional on another referendum.   A more likely possibility is that NI remains in a Customs Union with the EU and follows EU rules (so a  Norway + for just NI) while GB (UK minus NI) leaves the EU CU and rules, and the border is between  NI and the GB (and between GB and EU). The hard Brexiteers may agree to this, but I am not sure that a majority of MPs would. Those two possibilities are fairly clear and easy to understand and could maybe to turned in an agreed deal in 20 days. But getting parliament to pass it seems very unlikely.  The another perhaps more likely possibility is that BJ is suggesting a totally new approach (it was reported his idea was to get the Future Trade outine agreed before the WA). If this is what BJ wants I can't see it being done without extending A50 by some considerable time.  Its also possible that BJ and/or Varadkar are just spinning the process out and trying to blame the other, and the path does not exist. The referendum idea seems to be gaining momentum. Tony Blair has said a referendum would not need to take the 22 weeks previously suggested, because the 22 weeks included 12 weeks to pass legislation. So a referendum could be carried out in three months or so. But that would also require extending A50.

The EU has been asked to keep it confidential. One has to ask why, what does it say that BJ does not want the public to know?  I note that BJ has continued with give fake reasons for leaving the EU. In Parliament yesterday he claimed that the EU prevented the UK from improving animal welfare and that leaving the EU would allow the UK to ban the live export of animals for slaughter. This is of course totally false. The EU sets minimum animal welfare standards, member states can improve on them. The UK's suggested post-Brexit rule that animals must be slaughtered at the nearest abattoir and cannot be exported live does however contravene WTO rules on unfair trading practices. (a well sited abattoir could double or treble its prices if the farmer is forced to use only that one.) So if the UK intends being in the WTO post-Brexit it will not be able to do what it likes. The proposed law sounds to be unworkable anyway because the real issue is how animals are transported, not why they are being transported. Many animals are exported (cattle, race horses, zoo animals) some are exported to fatten up, so how would the law know what the animals fate would be? Would you be allowed to export a sheep but have to promise to keep it alive? How long? A day, a week, a month and year?  Improve the rules of how animals are transported Boris, but don't claim its got anything to do with Brexit.

The reason for having the excuses ready are so that BJ can claim that its not his fault for failing to leave the EU but the EU's/Parliament's/Soft Brexiteers/Hard Brexiteers/Ireland/Labour etc. BJ will need to blame someone when the next GE takes place. \nThe folks he is going to try to blame for his failure know what BJ is trying to so, and so they are in turn each tying to blame some other group. Therefore rather than just reject BJ's proposal they are all pretending that they are taking it seriously.   But lets join the game and pretend BJ is serious about his proposal and give it consideration.  \nFor some reason BJ has published only a description of his proposal not the legal text. What has been described sounds complex, but I suspect putting this in a watertight legal text will be very complex. Exactly how do you define the EU rules that NI would need to obey in order to have goods (including foods) conform to EU standards? Would those who produce the goods need to conform to EU employment law? Would NI have to conform to EU environmental laws? Would a business in NI be able to sell goods to any EU country and include a service contract? Would a NI service provider be able to operate in the EU? Would it be able to if it sold a product that was both a goods and service? \nIf the NI Assembly remains out of action (as it has been since March 2017) how would it be able to agree in the next 4 weeks that it would not block the BJ NI deal at the end of the implementation period? If it did block the BJ deal (which it could do if even one party in the Assembly wanted to) the EU and Ireland would appear to have signed a deal that would be never implemented. If NI remains under some EU rules what is the legal process to deal with disputes? Does the ECJ still try NI dispute cases. \nHow exactly would the new NI customs system work, which checks would not be done at the customers premises? What would happen when the customer is not in NI (for instance a freight shipment to/from Scotland.)\nHow/Where would the checks that goods from Britain (UK excluding NI) to NI be carried out to ensure that they conformed with EU rules (at the ports in NI? on ferries? at the ports in Britain?) Would the EU trust a 3rd country (the UK) to carry out these checks on its behalf? It sound to me that getting a fully watertight agreement would take a big team a lawyers months to draw up. \nThen the EU Parliament would need to agree the deal, and each Parliament in each EU country, as well as the EU Commission and UK Parliament (and NI Assembly). Originally the EU/UK timetable allowed for 12 months to prepare the WA legal text and 6 months for ratification. BJ insists in must be done in 28 days. He has repeatedly said that he will not extend the deadline by even a few days, if the deal is not complete by 31st Oct the UK will walkout with No Deal. Of course you may not believe him (I don't) but when someone insists that something has to be done by a particular date for no real reason, when it involves agreeing complex details, I assume I am dealing with someone who is afraid that the flaws is in the deal will became clear if too much time is spent looking at it. I am sure this is the case with this deal. So I am sure the EU will not agree to it., but if they did it would take more time and A50 would need to be extended. For UK MPs those who today say they would vote for the BJ proposal are in many cases also saying that BJ needs to make further changes to WA. My guess is that they are hoping that the EU reject the deal before they are called on to vote in Parliament.  Clearly Corbyn's plan is to force BJ to fail to deliver a deal before November, as a GE after that date would see BJ's Conservatives as Brexit failures opposed by the Brexit Party, both fighting for the Pro-Brexit vote.  The polls show that only 40% of voters think that leaving the EU is a good idea and the majority think another referendum is needed.      But I am sure A50 will need to extended first.

Assuming he can bring along just 15 of his own party members, can he get 5 more?  Or can he get the whole 22 from the Conservatives, including a couple of ERG members?  That seems very possible, if far from assured.  So I will put it at 52%.   Bringing us to the EU side.  Ireland may yet veto the UK government's new proposal, and their language is pretty strong against it.  The deal would require unanimity, wouldn't it?  And presumably most of Europe would defer to Ireland anyway.  But if Johnson can get parliamentary approval for his deal, that makes the Benn Act moot, and so the EU will be playing chicken with a Johnson government clearly happy to crash out.  So rejecting the deal would mean a crash out.  So maybe something less than even odds the E.U. would accept the new offer?  45%?  So 45% of 52% gives us 23.4%.  But I think I will tweak that upward to 25%.

This of course would not be enough, but the paranoia of Boris Johnson being willing to do whatever it takes to leave the EU has evidently set in and instead of waiting around these parties seem to be increasingly willing to respond.  Another thing to consider is that Boris Johnson used tactical voting in order to secure his position as PM, the votes were engineered in such a way that made Jeremy Hunt the 2nd place candidate over Michael Gove in the Conservative leadership contest, this was done because his campaign deemed JH to be less appealing to conservative party voters and therefore less of a threat. It's not impossible for BJ to use the same tactic in order to trigger a vote of no confidence, with a view to set a date for a general election after leaving. The worst case for BJ in triggering a vote of no confidence is watching Jeremy Corbyn request the extension which plays into BJ's rhetoric of JC being all about \"dither and delay\" so even this outcome would be a small victory for him in the run up to the General election that would follow.  On the flip side if the Vote of no confidence is triggered and the opposition parties cannot agree on a caretaker PM, the conservatives would be able to set a GE date for post Brexit, resulting in either a rehashed deal being brokered or a hard Brexit... It's not clear to me what would come first, but I'm fairly certain that a vote of no confidence will take shape and that the conservatives will 'lose' that motion.

Negotiations with the EU will continue in the meantime.  So it is possible that a new or amended WA agreed by the UK negotiators and the EU might be ready when Parliament returns.  The only action that I can see that can possibly occur in the absence of Parliament is the extension, as this does not require parliament to do anything further if the extension given by the EU is until the end of January.    However, this would require BJ to ask for one before he absolutely has to, which is very unlikely given his opposition to asking for an extension.  So it is very unlikely that anything will change or be resolved until Parliament starts its new session on 14 Oct.   The first day or two will include the Queen's speech, and the Government setting out its business for the new parliamentary session so there will not be a lot of time to discuss Brexit.  If a new or amended WA is on the table. then I can see BJ may wish to ask the MPs to vote on it in the first few days as if it passed then BJ would not need to ask the EU for an extension.  Now that the DUP is no longer able to prop up the Government as the two parties combined are now in a minority, it may be possible to reintroduce the idea of Northern Ireland being part of the Customs Union so that trade can freely flow between the North and the South and effectively put the border in the Irish Sea between Ireland and GB.  Although this is not acceptable to the DUP it might not meet significant resistance from the English, Scottish and Welsh MPs across all parties.  This would also remove the need for the backstop, which is the main element which prevented TM's WA from succeeding.  If no new or amended deal is on the table, then BJ may ask the MPs to vote for TM's WA.  Although this was previously rejected there is a chance that it may pass this time, as it would probably be more palatable to BJ to leave in accordance with the WA than to ask for an extension and he could whip his MPs to vote for it under threat of deselection, meaning even the ERG may vote for it this time.  There would probably also be enough Labour MPs that would vote for it to allow it to pass. Once a (new or old) WA has been passed by Parliament, there would be no need to ask for an extension. I think that there is a fair chance that a (new or old) WA will be voted on before 19 Oct.  If it passes, then the question will resolve once the UK leaves the EU on the Terms of the WA.  But it could still be possible that Parliament passes a WA and then sets a date for a GE between the date of passing the WA and actually leaving, which would cause the question to resolve in favour of a GE.  So we cannot discount this option yet.  It is very unlikely that there will be enough support for a GE until either an extension has definitely been obtained or a WA is passed. If no WA is agreed by 19 Oct, then BJ will have to ask for an extension.  Assuming that the EU agree (and I can't see them not agreeing as they are keen to avoid a no-deal exit), the question would then resolve in this way.   A no-deal exit is looking pretty unlikely on 31 Oct at this stage. So it seems as if an extension, leaving with a WA (old or new) or setting a date for a GE are the possible outcomes.\n "], [78343, "2019-09-10T15:14:51Z", [0.0, 0.2, 0.34, 0.0, 0.46, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [59882, "2019-09-10T13:03:59Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], "All-in on 'extend' because having broken down all the routes I can think of for Boris to avoid an extension, I can't see how any of them can succeed.

The government's plan is to test the legal limits of the Benn bill designed to force Boris to request an extension, but I think the government is doing this not in order to leave without a deal but to get a better deal from the EU. However even if the government's lawyers succeed in circumventing the bill, the EU is not daft - they know that all they have to do is refuse to budge then sit back and watch the chaos.

The latest polls on which party people would vote for in a GE show why BJ want to hold one now, and why besides stopping BJ from using the election process to stop the UK falling out of the EU, the other parties would prefer to wait until November The polls that specifically asked about voting intentions if the GE was before 1st Nov or after 31st Oct and the UK had not left the EU. If the GE was before 1st Nov the Conservatives would get the highest percentage of votes, if the GE was held after 31st Oct and the UK had not left the EU then either Conservative and Lobour would get an equal percentage of votes or Labour would get the highest percentage of votes. The Brexit Party would gain several percentage points if the UK has not left the EU by 1st Nov. The combined percentage  of the Conservative plus Brexit Party remains fairly constant no Brexit moves votes from the Conservatives to the Brexit Party.  An issue with the polling method is that some polls present the party choices differently. They offer some named Parties and \"other\" but the parties that are named are not the same in all polls. If \"other\" is selected the person being polled is then offered other Parties as options. From looking at the results any party that is one \"named\" will get more people chose it than if the person polled has to first select \"other\" and then choose from the smaller Parties. The biggest effect of this seems to be on the percentage of people who choose The Brexit Party. I understand that in some polls the Brexit Party is a first level option and on others its a in a sub-list within \"other\". I suspect (but I don't have the time or means to confirm) that the highest percentages for the Conservatives are when the Brexit Party in part of the \"other\" option.  For example the latest YouGove poll has the Conservatives on 35%, but it only lists Cons, Lab, LibDem and Brexit, while other polls have 10% of more of voters planning to vote for other parties. As some of these \"other\" parties such as the SNP will get high percentages in a region, and are likely to get a lot more seats that the Brexit Party or the LibDems the poll is misleading.  My conclusion (and that of the polling companies) is that when ever a GE is held the result is likely to be hung parliament, and if held after 31st Oct without Brexit happening it will probably be a hung parliament. My second comment is rather broader.\nAs the Brexit crisis has developed UK politics has changed more than it has in decades. We have been told that \"the will of the people\" is true democracy and that representative democracy is not. We have been told that MPs must vote for what \"the people want\". That MPs must vote for what the Leader of their Party tells them to. That Parliament must vote for what \"the people want\" even if their constituents do not want that. That Judges must take account of what \"the people want\" when ruling on legal disputes. Parliament can talk, but not set policy, that a job for the PM and his advisors. like children MPs should be seen and not heard.  In the last few weeks we have had Parliament being prorogued because, according to the PM having it sitting is inconvenient for the executive. We have had MPs kicked out of the ruling Party because the PM is sovereign and members of his party who disagree with him are inconvenient. Spending time coming up with policies that MPs will agree with wastes time, Arguing to find better policies is also a waste of time. \nWe are told that the PM does not need to obey the law if it contradicts what \"the people want\". And the only person who knows \"the will of the people\" is the PM.  We now hear that its very inconvenient have a Speaker in the Commons who does not toe the Government line. The old convention that when elected Speaker the holder ceased being a party representative and was therefore elected in his constituency unopposed.  So because the Speaker who was a Conservative has not given some Conservative MPs their own way, rather than allow Parliament to select its own Speaker, the Government will attempt to put up another Conservative candidate in his constituency so that the current Speaker  will cease to be an MP.\nI would not be surprised if the new Conservative Populist Party did not do what many Populist Government do and grab hold of the process of choosing the Supreme Court Judges.  After all the UK Supreme Court only dates back to 2009 (before that the Law Lords in the House of Lords had a similar role). It should easy enough to have the judges appointed by the PM. With no codified constitution, and with \"convention\" being thrown out the UK is in great danger of having an elected dictator as PM, who controls the executive, the legislation, and justice. Voters in other countries have allowed this to happen on many occasions. Cries for a decisive leader are answered by a strongman, who when crossed becomes a tyrant.\n\nIn this bright new world BJ would be sovereign. I doubt that \"the people\" will let him. So my forecast is that if BJ is not kicked out in the next few months the UK will be stuck a with him. Because there will be no effective parliament \"the people\" will take to the streets much as they have in Hong Kong.  So the Brexiteers were right and the UK will have become like the countries of the far east. Like Singapore where you have complete political freedom as long as you vote for the one party or Hong Kong where you have to give up all your political rights.  I hope the UK goes back to being a country of reason. I think it will but it will not be the same it will need a proper codified constitution.

BJ has said He will not go to the EU to ask for the extension. So his easiest way of getting out of that task, is to give the letter asking foe the extension (the letter is already written and included in the anti No Deal law) to someone else to take to the EU. BJ can speak to the EU by phone. Problem solved.  BJ has claimed that under EU rules the UK needs to supply a Commissioner to the EU and by not sending anyone after 31 Oct, the UK will be thrown out of the EU with No Deal. My guess is that the EU can get around that by simple having a chair marked \"UK Commissioner\" and when meetings where the UK Commisioner is supposed to attend just recording that the UK Commissioner failed to attend. As @Deelou suggested  BJ could simply present May's agreed WA with a few words changed in the accompanying Political Declaration, and say that it was new WA.  A more radical alternative would be for the EU to offer a real new WA, which as the UK seems unable to cut the Gordian Knot, the EU could write itself without any UK input. I am thinking of something along the lines of what was suggested (and rejected) on 24th June 2016, that the UK leaves the EU, but remains in the EEA and the Single Market. This would meet the objective of the UK leaving the EU (as per the 2016 Referendum question) but provide for frictionless trade between the UK and EU and would of course mean that no Irish Backstop was needed. I  fact is would be remarkable close to what BJ and others told voters before the referendum, that Brexit would be like.  BJ could then present it to the UK parliament. If any Conservative MPs failed to vote for (I am sure the ERG would not) BJ could deselect them as he has promised if they failed to back him. Maybe enough Labour MPs would vote for this WA to get it thru parliament.  I don't give this option much chance of happening, but the public might go for it as a way of ending Brexit (no more negotiations needed.)

He has repeatedly said that the UK is leaving on 31 Oct \"do or die\".  But a law is due to be passed on Monday which will force him to ask for an extension if there is no deal agreed by 19 Oct.  He's in a tricky situation now. What will he do? Break the law or backtrack and ask for an extension? Or try to find a way out?  He's a slippery politician and the way out route might seem the best face-saving option to him.  He could resign, but I don't think he's ready to move out of Downing St just yet. Holding a GE is another way out, but requires the other parties to agree to one.  They don't trust him and are likely to refuse until they have a Brexit extension in the bag unless the date of the election is guaranteed, which is not the case under Monday's motion, as the PM can choose the date of a GE.  Another way out would be to have a deal  agreed by 19 Oct. But time is running out for negotiating a new deal or even amending the old one.  So will he try to push TM's deal through in the new Parliamentary session before 19 Oct, possibly whilst claiming that he couldn't force the EU to give the UK a better deal because his negotiating strength had been curtailed by the threat of no-deal being taken off the table? He would then have managed to take the UK out of the EU by 31 Oct as he promised and could blame the Tory rebels and Labour for his failure to provide a better deal or indeed a no deal exit. That would probably allow him to keep his pro-Brexit supporter base and put him in a reasonably good position for contesting a GE. But how would parliament vote on the WA?  Would they be relieved that a no deal exit had been averted and take the WA this time? Or would they push for an extension then a GE in the hope of ousting Boris and installing a more pro-EU government? Could be a risky gamble.  Accordingly I'm increasing odds on leaving with a WA.

This forecast of mine is partially strategic.  Since the vote to hold a GE could happen in just a few days, closing this question, my forecast for a GE is higher than I think it really is.  I actually think that extending A50 is more likely.   I've made 24 forecasts on this question to date!  There's no way I'm going to score well, but I sure have learned a lot!

Emil presented me with a logical argument that I even could follow . . . but . . . . it seems counter-intuitive to me to not increase my forecast for a GE when it could be set in the next 4 days, when the other options either couldn't occur in that time-frame (the 3 leave options) or are extremely unlikely to happen in the next 4 days (revoke or set a date for a referendum since legislation to do either has not been submitted).  Even extend A50 is extremely unlikely to occur in the next 4-5 days because it hasn't been requested and the 27 EU countries do not have a meeting scheduled.   If a vote to set a date for a GE passes on Monday, when I knew it was on the agenda, and many analysts said it might, wouldn't I regret not having adjusted my forecast upwards for set a date?  I sure would!  If the vote fails, then I'll decrease my forecast.  Yes, my Brier score will suffer if I'm wrong (duh!) , but I won't feel as foolish about that as I would if I didn't adjust my forecast upwards for a GE today.  I'm willing to take the risk of being wrong for 4 days because maybe I'll be right.

The bill that is now going through the Lords should receive Royal Assent on Monday and would force BJ to ask for an extension if no WA is agreed by parliament by 19 October (or parliament had agreed to a no-deal Brexit which is very unlikely). BJ has tried once to call a GE, but didn't achieve a 2/3 majority.  It looks like another motion to call a GE is on the order paper for next Monday, again requiring a 2/3 majority. So what is likely to happen FIRST?\nThis depends on how the MPs vote on Monday.  Although the Opposition parties want a GE, they will not support one until they are sure that a no-deal Brexit isn't going to happen on 31 Oct.  On Monday, the bill should become law, but will this be sufficient for Labour to vote for a GE?  Keir Starmer is against this, as are the Lib Dems, as no-one trusts BJ not to shift the date of a GE once it has been voted for.  It would (to my mind) make more sense for them to abstain again and instead wait until either a WA has been agreed by Parliament or an extension has been granted by the EU.   If they don't vote for a GE and are then prorogued, nothing will happen until the start of the next parliamentary session.  At this point they will have until 19 Oct (a Saturday, and parliament doesn't usually sit on Fridays) to decide whether to accept a WA or not (likely to be TM's WA as it seems unlikely that another one will be agreed by then) and if not, BJ will be forced to ask for an extension. It seems that the potential Outcomes could be:\nA GE date is set first (if the Opposition parties vote for one next week which seems a bit risky)\nA WA (probably TM's given the lack of time) is agreed by 19 Oct\nBJ asks for an extension by 19 Oct.

Lord Lisvane, former Clerk of the House of Commons, who is obviously an expert on the process of passing legislation was interviewed last night. The view was that given yesterday's commons defeat for the Government the bill to prevent a No Deal brexit should get through the Commons today. A specific process in the House of Lords would be used that should see it passed on Friday. All this assumes that there is a majority for the bill at every step, but that seems likely because the Government now has no majority in either the Commons or Lords. It should have a majority in the Commons similar to last nights vote (i.e. around 27) and much bigger majority in the Lords. BJ has said he does not want a GE, but he is going to try and get the Commons to Vote for one under the FTP Act on Thursday. (I assume BJ does not expect anyone to believe a word he says, or think that it matters) This would require Conservative and Labour MPs to vote for it. Labour and the other opposition parties say they will not vote for a GE until they can be certain that their bill to stop a NO Deal brexit has become law.  As the bill to Stop a No Deal Brexit is unlikely be become law (assuming it passes) until next Monday BJ will not have much time to get MPs to vote for a GE before Parliament is prorogued. The order for Prorogation says that the earliest Parliament will be prorogued will be Monday 9th Sep and the latest will be Thursday 12th Sep.   As BJ is not trusted I would expect the opposition would not vote for the GE as soon as the bill to Stop No Deal is passed, but require that the date of the GE was guaranteed. The FTP Act does not allow amendment to be added, so it can't used to set guarantees or conditions. To have these another bill would first need to be passed  setting aside the FTP Act. Then another amendable bill could be passed guaranteeing the date of the GE, but the opposition could also add any other conditions such as a having a second referendum (aka Public Vote on Brexit). If BJ won a subsequent GE with a majority a new Government could overturn that, but it would show the public how this endless Brexit shambles could be ended (A No Deal would just be ending step one of Brexit and be followed by years or decades trying to get new deals.) If I was Corbyn I would not trust BJ to actually extend A50. The No Deal bill would not require BJ to seek an extension until after 19th Oct (if parliament has not passed an WA). BJ has said he would obey the law, but he has also said there is no way he will go to the EU to ask for an A50 Extension. (I guess one of these statements is true, but maybe neither is true.) Who knows what BJ will do. So using the excuse that as Parliament is being prorogued there is no time to get the FTPA set aside and get a a GE date agreed it make more sense to talk about a GE after 19th Oct and after BJ has got A50 extended. I would have thought that this would give Corbyn some tactic advantage regarding the subsequent GE. A GE held in November would show that BJs ridiculous \"do or die Brexit by 31st Oct\" was just hot air, that (probably) he has not negotiated a new WA by 31st Oct, the Conservative Party would be completely split between the Populist wing and the traditional wing. The longer he is PM the more mistakes BJ (and Cummings) are likely to make. We saw how Mrs May blew her chances at the 2017 GE, Cummings could do the same for BJ. Of course there are still the court cases that could mean the Prorogation has to be changed. Its not really relevant to this forecast, but BJ/Cummings/Rees-Mogg seem to be going out of their way to ensure no one from the centrist Conservatives would want to vote Conservative. RM acting like a cartoon version of the uncaring, arrogant, upper class toff in the Commons is unlikely to attract votes. I would recommend the other political parties run a Facebook campaign with picture of RM lounging on the benches in the commons with the caption \"vote Conservative, to get a No Deal Brexit, help my offshore investment fund, and lose your job\".

Initially, that made me think, \"Aha, there'll be an extension of A50!\"  Then, it occurred to me that no, there's no extension of A50 until the PM requests it and the EU agrees to it, neither of which has happened, and furthermore, BJ says he will NOT do as instructed, and even if he does, the EU may not vote on it until it meets Oct 17-18. A lot could happen between now and Oct 17th!  And this question is about what will happen FIRST. BJ is saying that if he is forced to ask for an extension of A50, he'll call an election (in hopes of re-gaining a majority and being able to pass legislation that reverses that requirement, and in hopes that having a stronger majority he might be able to negotiate a better deal.)

That means either BJ gets May's deal thru parliament (unlikely) or a new deal agreed by the EU and passed by parliament (very unlikely by 31st Oct) or the PM has to ask the EU to Extend A50.  Bj pretends he does not want a GE (but no one believes him, actually no one believes anything he says) but lets it be known that the GE he does not want can take place on 14th Oct. All he needs to do is get the opposition to vote for the GE that he does not want. Some of the turkeys are scratching their heads, but most know that they are being invited to vote for Christmas   The opposition knows it can't trust BJ (actually almost everyone knows not to trust BJ). A GE on 14 Oct could produce a hung parliament and even if BJ does not get a majority he could still be PM on 31st Oct, or Bj could just change the date of the GE after parliament had voted for it. So it looks as if the opposition will not agree to a GE until A50 has been extended.  If BJ kicked out 20 or so Conservative MPs for voting against him, the opposition would be stronger and the Government weaker. So without a GE Bj would be PM in name but unable to get anything contentious thru parliament. If I was Corbyn I would be quite happy to have that situation of a few weeks or months. I would offer a GE after BJ had extended A50 and had got into law that any Brexit Deal would need to be approved by a Peoples Vote.  Meanwhile its seems that Conservative local groups are starting to push back against BJ. Hammond one of the \"rebels\" threatened with de-selection has been re-selected by his local constituency (a poke in the eye for BJ). The idea of those kicked out by BJ forming a new independent conservative group  (or maybe they will call themselves the True Conservatives) is taking hold. They would probable be the 3rd biggest opposition group in parliament.\n What Cummings and BJ are doing is regarded as dangerous by some Conservatives, and they are adding up the things they don't approve of; bullying and dismissing staff without due process, proroguing parliament (not playing the game according the spirit of the rules), throwing out previously loyal Conservatives while promoting people who have been consistently disloyal for decades, claiming that they are negotiating a deal with the EU in good faith while privately saying they are just going thru the motions  This is not how traditional Tories expect people to behave. So its possible that by some trickery a GE does take place. Its possible that due to the complexity of the process the Opposition law to block No Deal fails to get thru. But the probability is that A50 is extended first and a GE date is set afterwards. It might be agreed to hold a referendum but until a question is agreed there is not much point in setting the date.

He said there will not be a GE (but who knows, its BJ saying it so it might be true it might not be. The BBC commentators don't believe him. They are suggesting he could well try and get an election by Thursday).  He also claimed he had made progress with getting a deal with the EU (I don't think anyone believes that. It is reported that the two committees tasked with writing up a detailed description of the Irish Border solution, to give the EU, have reported that the ideas they are supposed to be including regarding the Irish border have serious drawbacks, and so BJ has nothing to give the EU explaining the answer to the border). So all BJ said was that MPs have to back him and not try to get an extention to A50. It is now reported that 22 Conservative MPs will vote to stop No Deal (the names have been released and they include some very eminent Conservative figures.) In the background could be heard a crowd jeering at the PM all the way through his speech.  \nBig build up, to nothing. Ex-PM Blair gave a good speech this morning (in my opinion and of several media people). In it he warned Corbyn of facilitating a GE that would lead to a No Deal exit.  Vernon Bognador who is often described as the foremost expert on the constitution is saying that BJ seems to be trying to say that he could turn a vote into Confidence issue and if he loses it call an election. Bognador says this is not allowed under the Fixed Term Parliament Act. BJ would need to get a 2/3 majority to call a GE himself, or Corbyn would have to call a No Confidence motion and win it. He also pointed out that BJ's comment that there was no way he would ask the EU for an A50 extension, was wrong because parliament could tell him to. A guy from Deltapoll gave an explanation of the risk to the Conservative of having a GE. His point was that although the Conservatives appear to be well ahead of Labour in the polls, it was by no mean certain that the Conservatives would get a majority in an election. The reason is that voters have switched parties in a big way since previous elections.  Broadly the Conservatives used to be party of business and the middle class, Labour used to be the party of the Working Class. Gradually the Conservatives became the party of the upwardly mobile, and Labour the party of redistribution. Since 2016 the Conservatives have tried to become the party of Leaving the EU, which has meant trying to get the votes of the very people that were most damaged by the Thatcher Conservative government of the 1980s. but this has driven out many of more liberal Conservatives. Labour since 2015 when Corbyn took over has tried to become the party of the radical left, driving out middle class voters who liked Blair. The LibDems have become the party for Remain, picking up votes from voters who had supported Labour and Conservatives. The Brexit Party has picked up voters (mainly older voters) from the right and left who like Populist policies delivered by a strong leader. So in short most voters would hardly recognize the party that they had voted for five years ago. What is not known is how many voters in each constituency have changed party and which party they have gone to. For example Conservative voters in London have largely switch to the LibDems.  Because of the UK voting system there is a big disconnect between a parties share of national support and the number of seats it gets in parliament. A party need to get it vote concentrated in specific constituencies and not spread too thinly.  A new problem for the Conservatives is Scotland where the leader of the Scottish Conservatives resigned a few days ago. She was credited with getting all the Conservatives in Scotland elected, without her leadership (and BJ's unpopularity in Scotland) commentators are suggesting that the Conservatives could lose six MPs from Scotland. A similar problem could arise in Wales. As the BJ Conservative Party is seem in Scotland and Wales as an English nationalist party.

Courts and \"legislation\" and arguing about how many days Parliament sits before the Queen's Speech and Party Conferences is meaningless.\nits all tactics by Bojo to enrage and motivate the Brexit base for election.

The remainers in the Tory Party  may lose the whip over legislation proposed but they will never ever support\nA Motion of No  Confidence when Corbyn will become PM for a second. Corbyn will not give way to Ken Clarke or anyone. Under this Five Year Act ( another bright idea like the referendum by Cameron to keep Lib Dems from leveraging their coalition status) there must be a 2/3 vote for a general election before the expiration of 5 years There must be  2 week notice and  a 6 week campaign. That means even if there was a 2/3 vote to call elections, the 8 weeks will expire and elections will be in November which is, of course, after October 31,2019. At that point EU and Johnson can agree on  30 day extension.\nJohnson wants  his government to present their program in the Queens Speech to build support beyond his Brexit base.\nSo far Johnson has promised $5-billion in goodies for NHS  and schools as well as corporal punishment and a war against knife crimes and grab and run theft. Johnson  realizes he needs Tory Remainer votes and Labor Votes to call a general election. What choice does the opposition and Tory rump have at that point? \nBojo is not stupid. He knows there is no negotiating to be done with EU and I presume he wants a general before Brexit where there is the potential for his support to crater if  he cannot  manage Brexit properly. The Tory  remainers who survive will campaign hard for him  over Corbyn for many reasons. At some point he  will  sit down with Hammond and Corbyn and agree on a date for general elections before 10-31 and that creates the  2/3 vote.   Once elections are called for a date certain then Bojo can ask EU for the 30-60  days necessary to allow for general election without alienating his supporters. i suspect Bojo will do this as soon as Parliament with the Opposition and Remainer Tories pass meaningless legislation that is unenforceable upon the executive. The Courts will do nothing on the suspension of Parliament or enforcing the legislation At that point Bojo can point to the traitorous Tory remainers and Corbyn for the delay of the promised Brexit date and this will whip up the Brexit base against the undemocratic elite attempting to void the referendum.\nHe needs every Brexit supporter's. vote, plus whatever seats Brexit party  win in an electoral coalition for the campaign and Farage has already indicated his acceptance of an electoral pact.

Several sources are saying that at least twenty Conservative MPs are saying they will vote to ensure a No Deal Brexit does not occur. I have heard nothing, in the last week, that suggests any opposition MPs intend supporting the Government in stopping the anti No Deal MPs. So in theory the anti No Deal MPs have the numbers to stop No Deal.  Threats to deselect  Conservative MPs who  vote against the government have been hinted at, but its not been made official.  (technically remove the Conservative Whip and ban them from standing in an election as Conservative MPs).  How real a threat is this? The Government has a majority of one, so if any Conservative MP has the whip removed, the Government will not have a majority at all. With no majority it would be impossible to govern. Until 2011 a GE would have been called by the PM, but now the PM could only try and get parliament to vote for a GE with a 2/3 majority. A 2/3 majority would need the Labour Party and the Conservative Party to both vote for a GE. Kier Stammer (the Labour Shadow Minister for Brexit made clear today that the Labour Party would not vote with the Conservatives for a GE if it would result in a No Deal Brexit on 30 Oct (so any GE would have to take place after A50 had been extended and the GE would be after 30 Oct.) So I think that rules out a GE called by the PM being \"called\" (i.e. a date being set) before 30 Oct or before an A50 extension. If Conservative MPs had been deselected what would happen at the next election? Its quite possible that the deselected MPs could stand again for their existing seat but run as an independent. If the election was to take place (say) in November or December the Conservative Party would need to find new candidates. So you could have the \"official Conservative\" and the \"independent conservative\" plus all the other parties running against each other. Who knows if either the \"official\" or \"independent\" Conservative would win. The \"independent\" would have name recognition and might win. The \"Conservative\" vote might be split and someone from another party might win. In any event it would be unlikely to help the Conservative cause. The next election looks very difficult to call, so splitting the Conservative vote would not be a smart move. (An election with \"conservatives\" having a choice between \"No Deal\" Conservatives and Brexit Party candidates and \"anti No Deal\" conservatives.) Starmer is not giving details of the cross party plan to stop a No Deal, but reading between the lines it appears the plan would be (a) try to get the Government to keep parliament open (b) try to get time to try and vote through legislation that would have the effect of extending A50. Items (a) and (b) to take place next week. If this fails then around the 21 Oct have a vote of No Confidence in BJ. If that passed then parliament would vote to see if it had Confidence in Corbyn. If that failed (as it probably would) then immediately have a vote to see if MPs had Confidence in a backbench MPs such as Ken Clark or Harriet Harmon. If it did then they would ask the EU to extend A50. Then MPs would vote on what to do next. That would likely be to both try and get a better Brexit deal from the EU (probably by staying in the Customs Union and Single Market) and then having a public vote. Presumably a GE would happen at some point.  Is what I believe is the anti No Deal plan, likely to be deliverable. I don't see a big problem with the numbers. If 20 Conservatives are committed even if a few chicken out the numbers are there. I doubt that more than two or three Opposition MP would vote with BJ. The problem is the time. I don't know what the government can do toslow things down. Assuming that the Speaker stops attempts to block the bill it should be passed by the Commons. Its less clear how much it could be slowed in the Lords, but the Lords has a means by which Lords can just vote to force another Lord from wasting time with speeches. So I would think there is a 60% chance of getting anti No Deal legislation through. With a vote of No Confidence (now that it appears it is agreed how to follow up and get a new PM) I would give that an 80% chance. So I make that a 92% chance of extending A50.

First none of them thought that the UK was making any serious effort to get a deal with the EU. They assumed he was saying that he was trying to get a deal was just hot air for the benefit of a UK audience. They all rejected the idea that \"remainer\" MPs trying to stop No Deal would discourage the EU from coming up with a new deal. They pointed out that the UK did not seem serious about the \"alternative\" arrangements for the Irish border, as it had not set up any trials of the the supposed solutions.  And they thought that no one in the EU wanted to offer BJ anything because they had no trust in him to deliver anything that he agreed. They foreign correspondents were very doubtful that MPs were sufficiently organised to be able to either pass legislation or remove BJ from office to stop No Deal. The one UK national did think parliament had the numbers to block No Deal, but had doubts that would be able do it. All were agreed that the Government (under Cummings the de facto CEO of the UK) was well organised and ruthless. (e.g. any Conservative MP voting against the Government would be deselected and would not able to run as a Conservative at the next election.)  So their conclusion was that No Deal was almost certain.   Steve Richards (the only UK member of the panel) was of the opinion that the Conservative ERG MPs were unlikely to vote for any deal with the EU, and that even if BJ managed to get the EU to agree a Brexit that might be acceptable to enough Labour MPs get get a majority in Parliament, BJ could not put it forward because it would split the Conservative Party permanently. This was in spite of their opinion that BJ really did not want a No Deal but had no way of achieving ant deal. My opinion is that BJ has started a fire that he has lost control of, and can't put it out. The role of Dominic Cummings is critical. His belief in strong, ruthless, single mindedness is both a strength and weakness. The current Government is filled with weak people, but even weak politicians might resent finding just when they achieve what they thought was high office, that their actual role is to dance to the tune of an unelected Special Advisor who sets the policies and runs the government. The staff dismissals that been made shows who is the boss (e.g. Cummings fires Minister's staff without even telling the Minister). I would have thought that spending years to rise to a political office and then be told you can't speak to the media, can't announce policies, and can't chose your own staff, and that your role is simply to vote for what you are told to vote for, would be resented by Ministers. As for MPs their role only exists because the outdated system requires them, it would clearly be easier to shut Parliament permanently.   I think that MPs might be able to \"take back control\" and stop No Deal. In the longer term I am certain that the current Populist Authoritarian take over will not last.  I note that the Sun and Daily Mail newspapers have headlines claiming that the polls show  that BJ 's closing parliament for 5 weeks  has boosted the popularity of the Conservative Party. The poll they are referring to carried out on 29th/30th Aug has the Conservatives on 31%, which is actually lower than the any of the last 6 polls and almost exactly the same as the polls taken by the same pollster on 6th/11th Aug. 31% is not an obvious number to win an election. The same pollster asked on the same day Should the UK Remain or Leave the EU, 51% said Remain, 46% said Leave. A different pollster asked the day before \"with hindsight do you think the UK was Right or Wrong to Vote to Leave the EU?\"  40% thought it was right, and 50% thought it was wrong. This does not look like much support for the Conservatives or a sign that a GE would be walkover. I think BJ has started a fire, not only can't he put it out, but he lit the fire at the only exit to the building while he was inside. And to make matter worse he has hired a guy to throw extra petrol on the flames.

It has been pointed out that the proroguing Parliament for 5 weeks only reduces the number of planned sitting days between now and 31 Oct by 4 or 5 days, so its not that big a deal. But this ignores the detail. First, BJ knows that MPs were planning to call for a vote on keeping Parliament open during the \"conference\" period so that this increases the shutdown, but the bigger difference is that what BJ has done is have two separate sessions; 3rd Sep to 12th Sep and then 14th Oct onward. As they will be separate session any business started before 14th Oct but not completed will die, and will have to be started again after 14th Oct. Also normally when a new session of Parliament starts the first week is taken up with the Queens Speech (the statement of what business the session will aim to deliver) and then several days discussion of that business. So in fact there is very little contiguous time to pass legislation. May 4 or 5 days before Prorogation and 5 or 6 days after the new session starts. The Government is suggesting that it has additional ideas of how to block the opposition e.g. by the PM refusing to present new legislation to the Queen so that it does not become law, and/or creating new Bank Holiday Days (Statutory days when businesses, including Parliament are closed), This behaviour is totally new to UK democracy, which has depended on unwritten codes of what is acceptable. It is known that Dominic Cummings does not hold with this. Presumably he learnt a different system of democracy in the years he spent in Russia. Or maybe Munira Mirza (BJ's Director of Policy) learnt it in her years as a Member of the Revolutionary Communist Party. She has studied how Direct Democracy can be used to help Autocratic leaders get power. In any event BJ is not playing by any unwritten rules and so its unclear if he can be stopped.  If Bj would really not get Royal Accent to bills passed by Parliament, or would refuse to step down if he lost a vote of No Confidence I have no idea. Its clear that many Conservative MPs are prepared to go along with BJ, and its less clear how many Conservatives would not.  Its unclear how far the Speaker would go to bend the usual rules, and its unclear if the Supreme Court would interfere in matters that do not break laws, but are clearly aimed to stop Parliament. Its unclear if the public will go along with a PM with no majority in Parliament, that has not got any mandate except to Leave the EU, who seems to believe in the rule of the Big Man, not democracy.  I am finding it difficult to figure out what BJ's aim is. (I assume Cummings and Mirza's aims are to create chaos so that they can put a revolution into place.) I don't see Bj's actions leading to the EU giving the UK a Brexit Deal that has no backstop and BJ getting that through Parliament before 1st Novemember. I don't see a completely new WA deal being agree by then either. So I keep returning to the the only way to leave the EU before 1 November would be with No Deal. This would probable suit Cummings fine, but for BJ it would be a failure. For Corbyn having the Conservatives engineer a situation so that its impossible to block No Deal could be ideal. A GE after 1 Nov, where BJ can be attacked as the autocrat that stopped Parliament preventing No Deal would not do Labour election chances any harm at all.     On the other hand it looks unlikely that Corbyn would go along with helping BJ set a GE date of his choice.

The UK media has gone into complete meltdown this afternoon and is simply not reporting the facts. The government today advised the Queen to prorogue Parliament \"no earlier than Monday 9th September and no later than Thursday 12th September 2019 to Monday 14th October 2019\" [1]. Parliament voted in July to suspend House of Commons business so that MPs could attend their respective party conferences (which they do every year) [2] so parliament will not be sitting anyway from Thursday 12 September to Wednesday 9 October. So all today's announcement did in terms of parliamentary debating time was move the October opening date from Thursday 10th to Monday 14th. Parliament does not sit on Friday, Saturday or Sunday so only one sitting day has been lost. But for some reason remainers in parliament, the media, even the speaker of the house are screaming that it's a constitutional outrage! Why? They don't say. Boris has prorogued parliament when it was due to be shut anyway, as voted for by MPs in July. The only thing that this move by Boris does is to prevent parliament from cancelling the party conference break and thereby allowing parliament to sit through that period. The fact that all the usual suspects (Grieve, Soubry, Bercow et al) have gone so completely crazy today makes me think that they had a plan to stop brexit which relied on cancelling the conference break and this move by Boris has scuppered their plan. In his letter [3] to Tory MPs today, Boris highlighted the meeting of the European Council on 17-18 October and set out his aim to get a deal approved by the EU at that meeting then get it passed by parliament on 21-22 October. So it would appear that Boris is trying to get to that meeting with no-deal still available to him as an option, in order to put maximum pressure on the EU and give himself the best chance of getting a deal.

As has been widely reported the opposition parties agreed to work together to try and stop a No Deal Brexit by passing legislation in Parliament requiring the Government to ask the EU to extend A50. The first question is do they have the number of MPs to do this. It is highly probable that they do. It would seem unlikely that more than one or two Opposition MPs would vote against the proposed legislation and very likely that quite a few Conservative MPs would vote for such legislation. For Conservative MPs (most of whom are not in favour of No Deal) voting for an extension to A50 would be far easier to justify than the alternative idea of voting that they had No Confidence in their own PM (although in reality they don't have any confidence in him).  It seems that the opposition to No Deal group is in touch with all the actors that are needed to get this to work (e.g. the speaker, Conservative MPs, the EU, experts on parliamentary procedure).   As the Opposition is backing the legislation route to avoid No Deal I don't see how BJ would be able to get Parliament to agree to let him call a GE. Opposition MPs are fully aware BJ might try and call a GE and are fully aware that BJ can't do that without the Opposition backing a GE call in a vote, and so are fully aware that BJ aim would be achieve a No Deal occurring automatically on 31st Oct. So I can't see a GE being called by the 31st Oct. Of course BJ might try to Prorogue Parliament to prevent the Ext. A50 legislation getting through Parliament. Although (like many things in the UK) it not 100% clear if BJ would be able to Prorogue Parliament in order to stop Parliament voting, it is clear that using Prorogation to block the will of Parliament is not following the spirit of how parliamentary democracy is supposed to work and so might have consequences when the next GE does happen. So I doubt that BJ will risk trying Prorogation. There is a question of would the EU grant an A50 extension? Presumably if the Opposition Legislation just told the PM to request an extension with no reason given, the EU might turn down the request. If the there is no reason given in the legislation for the extension I think it is probable that the EU would grant it (there are talks going on with the EU). But from the UK's point of view there has to be something that happens during the extension period to resolve Brexit. If that is a GE or further talks about a revised deal, all that might achieve is delaying the problem and having exactly the same situation in a few months (or years) time. A resolution to Brexit requires not just leaving the EU, but leaving the EU with a clear framework for the Future Relationship or an agreement to cancel A50.  A No Deal Brexit would not resolve matters. By far the quickest means to a Brexit resolution would be to hold another referendum. If the public voted to Remain after all that would end Brexit. If however the public voted to Leave again unless a majority voted for a specific relationship with the EU nothing would be clear. In my opinion having been stupid enough to have started this process the UK should stay in the EU until the majority of the public vote for or against a specific Future Relationship.  In order to hold a referendum on Brexit A50 would need to be delayed by at least 6 months (until June 2020?).   I don't detect any sign of BJ making any serious attempt to renegotiate changes to May's Deal or putting forward any outline of another deal. I don't see where BJ hopes to finish up in the UK's relationship with the EU. I suspect he has no idea either. He does not appear to be someone who has a plan. His advisors don't appear to be people who have any plans either, apart from having power for powers sake. I guess this is how Popularism works; drift in the current in whatever direction the opinion polls are going.

I have begun by eliminating options 1 and 4.  Option 1 doesn't serve the interests of any of the competing parties.  Option 4 would require a degree of cooperation which is highly unlikely.   Options 6 and 7 - if they occur - are likely to occur before 31 October as a means of resolving the problem.  Therefore their probability of occurring FIRST is increased.  Option 6 seems more likely than Option 7 because (a) the Labour Party is seeking an election to achieve its objective of attaining power and (b) PM Johnson may wish for an election to consolidate his power.  In general very few politicians seem to like to idea of popular votes except as an expedient to get their own preferred policy through.  They would much rather have an election which offers them the prospect of securing enough power to force it through without  a popular vote.  Also, Option 7 requires a \"date\" to be set for the referendum. Even if one is legislated, it seems unlikely that the date would be set before the calling of an election.  On balance Option 7 is very unlikely and for convenience I have set its probability to 0. We must now address the question of what would happen if an election were called.  If called with PM Johnson in control it would NOT be preceded by an extension of Article 50.  If called by Remainers , they will almost certainly not do so without first extending Article 50 (as failure to do so would lead to their worst possible outcome). In the absence of better information I place equal probabilities on Remainers and Leavers winning the battle in the Commons.   If Remainers win, then Option 5 will occur first.   If PM Johnson wins then I place equal probability on his calling an election first and NOT calling an election first.  If an election is NOT called, then I judge that he will pursue No Deal over a revised deal because (a) the EU have shown reluctance to renegotiate and (b) it would be logistically impossible for them to do so in the time frame. The final probabilities are therefore: Remainers win (Option 5) 50%\nPM Johnson in power calls General Election (Option 6) 25%\nPM Johnson in power, no General Election, No Deal (Option 3) 25%\nNo General Election Revised Deal 0% (That's the best I can do for the moment.

According to Johnson these goods include; bell peppers, wine, pork pies and shower trays. \n2. An email has been seen that indicates that Johnson has been asking for legal views on proroguing parliament.\n3. Many contentious issues are said to be being \"considered\" e.g. HS2 a very high cost rail link from London to the North that the Brexit Party says it would abandon; reduce fuel duty which has been frozen frozen for several years, its unpopular (what tax is not?) but is supposed to be a \"nudge\" to help improve air quality and reduce CO2. Expect many more things such as care for the old to be \"reviewed\" in the next few months.\n3. Rumours are circulating that Bj wants an election in mid-October, and wants to call it on 9 Sept.  So what does this all add up to? The \"reviews\" sound like preparation for GE. They are a great way of dealing with contentious issues as long as the issue is being \"reviewed\" different groups of voters can be told that the government wants to do exactly what that group wants e.g. young people concerned about the environment can be told that BJ wants cars off the road because they pollute and that he is in favour of public transport, while older drivers in rural areas can be told BJ wants them to have cheaper fuel for their cars, paid for by not building public transport.  I assume the remarks about the difficulty of exporting pork pies etc, to the US are intended to show what a tough negotiator BJ will be. But most people, and particularly the media, will notice what BJ is saying stop UK exports to the US is very similar to what he used to write about, in the 1990s as EU rules that stopped UK exports to the EU. They will also remember that BJ was (is) notorious for making up these types of stories, and so will assume that they are probably either untrue or that BJ has taken a grain of truth and built it into a misleading mountain.  But for now I will assume they are true, which raises the question of what was his purpose of telling reporter about the problems with exporting. The UK has spent 40 years working with all the other countries in the EU to create a Single Market of 28 countries with a population of 500 million people, that originally all had their own product, health, safety, labour, environmental  standards, rules and systems, in order to avoid the export problems that BJ says occur with trade outside the EU. Businesses that trade internationally will tell you that the specific rules in each country are not the problem, its the fact that each trading zone has different rules that creates trade friction. So you can't have one product, produced the same way and packed in the same packaging rolling off the same line, but multiple variations that add to costs and complexity.  So BJs remarks seem to show why a trade deal with the EU which at the moment has the same rules and standards as the UK is worth a lot more to the UK than a trade deal with US that has different standards. Of course BJ may think the US will happily changes its rule to please the UK, but its a lot more likely that UK will be told to change its rules to fit the US (in fact it already has been told that.)  So on the one hand BJ seems to be gearing up for an election, on the other hand his poll numbers don't look that good, and how would he actually engineer such an outcome. As far as I can see the most likely outcome of a GE (before Brexit) with these polling numbers would be a hung parliament, with the Conservatives and Brexit Party both fighting for the same ex-Labour voters in the English Midlands and North. My guess is that the Brexit Pary would get few, if any MPs but would take votes that might have otherwise gone to the Conservatives (there is some doubt that they would because many ex-Labour voters would never vote Conservative). While Labour and the LibDems/Greens seem to be fishing in the same pool the LibDems/Greens tend to be younger, more interested in the environment and not interested in the type of 1960s Socialism that Corbyn is keen on. Corbyn supporters are left wing young people and older tribal Labour supporters. The LibDems tend to be stronger in the South and Labour in the North.  To get Parliament to vote for a GE, BJ would need to persuade Labour and Conservative MPs to take a huge risk of losing their own seats and for their own Parties to end up with fewer seats than they have today. For both groups (the majority of whom do not want a No Deal Brexit) it would increase the risk of No Deal happening (because it could take weeks after a GE to form a new Government). Its possible that MPs would be stupid enough to vote for something they don't want (MPs have not shone in their ability to act rationally over the last 3 years.  So it boils down to how, even if he wants to, would BJ get 2/3 MPs to vote for a GE? Obviously TM got Labour to vote for a GE in 2017 when, like now they were trailing the Conservatives by a long way in the polls. In 2017 voters in the actual election votes differently and more tactically than they had said they would vote in the opinion polls. About half the UKIP supporters seem to have switched, initially they appear to moved to Conservative, but in the last few days they appear to have also switched to Labour. Many voters thought Labour was less of a hard Brexit risk and switched from all the small parties (LibDems, Greens, PC, SNP), Labour might think this pattern would happen again, But the difference was that in 2017 the LibDems, Greens and UKIP were all only polling at 10% or less, which under FPTP means that if your favoured party has less than 20% of support in your constituency it makes sense to switch from voting for who you like, to voting for who you least dislike. In 2019 there are far more constituencies where the LibDems are polling closer to the 20% mark and either the Conservatives or Labour look like the no hopers. So the Conservatives might expect to pick up 5 or 6% extra from the Brexit Party, but it looks unlike that Labour would pick up much from the LIbDems.  If I were advising Labour on a strategy I would refuse to fall for the offer of a GE without first getting an undertaking (legally binding) that BJ would rule out a No Deal Brexit and extend A50 so that a Public Vote on Brexit would happen (and make sure that BJ could not fix the question to be voted on.) As 52% of the public want a Public Votes (vs 29% who don't) doing this would help Labour in a GE as well as avoid a No Deal.      I have not heard anything that makes me think BJ is seriously working on a proposal to give the EU for a revised WA. So far all has said is the same as he has being saying for a couple of years. As BJ says if you don't put the effort and enthusiasm you don't get want you want.

My reading of what France and Germany seemed to be saying is; its up to the UK to sort out which of its contradictory red lines it really wants, don't expect us to try and solve your problem for you. The position of the EU is unchanged it wants a resolution and it would talk, and could even change the WA but only if the UK first deals with the contradictions. The obvious main contradiction is it needs the befits of the Customs Union and Single Market to give it frictionless trade with the EU and to keep the Irish Border open, but also wants to be outside the Customs Union and Single Market in order to reduce (or control) immigration from the EU and to do FTAs with 3rd countries.  The problem with removing the contradictions is that the ERG section of the Conservative Party will not vote for a WA that includes any commitment to staying in the Single Market and Customs Union. However the ERG only makes up about 10% of MPs. If faced with the option of No Deal or a compromise deal (e.g. an EEA type deal) a combination of the majority of Conservative MPs (say 200) plus a majority of Labour MPs (say another 200) could vote through a WA. Is this very likely, no. Is it possible, yes. Would it mean changing the WA? It could be done by just replacing the Backstop with a statement that the UK would remain in the Single Market and Customs Union at the end of the Implementation Period. The Political Declaration would need to be changed to reflect this. Could it be sold to the ERG? I would sell it on the basis that the WA had got rid of the backstop they did not like, and that if at some future date the UK wanted to leave the Customs Union and Single Market they could give notice and do it (where as the Backstop has no unilateral exit clause, being in the Customs Union and Single Market as part of being in the EEA there is a unilateral exit route.)  Would the EU agree to it? I am going back to what Macron and the EU have said many times before; they are not minded to waste time with talks unless the UK first shifts it position on its red lines. The above would be a shift and I think the EU would be willing to discuss it in detail and if need be extend A50 to give time to produce a revised WA.  I don't see any realistic prospect of the EU agreeing to just remove the Backstop as Johnson has requested, and even if they did its unclear that the ERG would vote for the WA anyway. The \"solution\" that Johnson is proposing to produce seems to be based on the same ideas already rejected by the EU. The current border with Ireland is a very simple concept. The same rules apply both sides so for most purposes the border is invisible even though the currencies and VAT are different. The \"solution\" is far more complex and requires forms, registrations and,  because all the rules will over time diverge.   In my opinion there is now more doubt that MPs will block a No Deal. It is no secret that Brexit appeals to the Right and Left Populist/Authoritarian part of politics. Corbyn faction is of the Left Populist/Authoritarian end of the spectrum and he personally wants Brexit (to him the EU is a right wing capitalist conspiracy). As long as the Conservatives get blamed for any problems that arise from Brexit he would be very happy because that gives him a great opportunity to win a GE and being outside the EU he can introduce the hard left socialist policies (nationisations, state aid etc.) that the EU competition rules prevent. So the best outcome for Corbyn would be for him to appear to have tried to save the day by trying to block No Deal, but to have been thwarted by the Conservatives.  Johnson's objectives are in some ways not that different from Corbyn's. His preference would be to get the WA passed, but appears to have no idea how to do it (he's forgotten about a soft Brexit that moderate Conservatives and Labour MPs could both support). So that appears to only leave him the option of a No Deal Brexit. But he knows a No Deal comes with the risk that whoever's fault failure to get a deal is pinned on, is unlikely to win a GE. So either he needs a GE before too much of the disadvantages of No Deal manifest themselves or better he needs to pin the blame for failure to get a Brexit on someone else. As everyone is aware of this so blaming someone else will not be easy.   One way out for Johnson would be to get Corbyn to support the idea of GE. Johnson could just try and get Labour and Conservative MPs to both vote for a GE or to let Corbyn call a Vote of No Confidence with a GE to follow. It might well suit Johnson if Corbyn were to become a caretaker PM, and Extend A50 and then have a GE a few weeks later.  (Blame Corbyn for not delivering Brexit and hope to win a majority in a GE.) But many commentators think that its very difficult to predict how a GE would play out, the polls may be very misleading. In 2017 the Conservatives were on over 45% at the start of the campaign, but ended up with no majority. Labour was on 25% at the start and finished up on 40%. Johnson must be aware of that. The latest poll shows the Conservatives appear to have picked up most of the Brexit Partiy's support (they are on 42%, Labour 28%, LibDems 15%). This is one poll and quite a lot different from other recent polls. The same polling company has consistently been out of steep with other pollsters. It currently shows Remain only 1% ahead of Leave when other polls have Leave between 7% and 4% ahead. But they are also showing that 52% of voters want a Final Deal put to a Public Vote vs 29% who don't. I suspect the 42% support for the Conservatives could be that the people polled expected Johnson's visit to France and German (which happened after the polls were taken) to be likely to result in a deal.    Both Johnson and Corbyn would want to avoid a Public Vote (i.e, a referendum) because they both want Brexit (the Labour Party officially is still unclear, but Corbyn has been against the EU for decades) and the probability is that the public would vote to Remain.  Many MPs will want to avoid a GE (because many of them would lose their seats).  So lots of complexity!

So I have rejected the idea that any of the parties has a cunning plan to solve Brexit. This makes forecasting very difficult because its not possible to workout from clues what is going to happen.  The announcement that the Freedom of Movement will end on 31st October is typical. What does it mean? What exactly will be different on 1 November? Why announce it now and then say the details will follow later? Without details the statement means nothing. The only facts that I can extract from the announcement is that the government is afraid of announcing what will be in its post Brexit immigration bill, and afraid of putting in in front of MPs. \nMany of the people I meet have experience of delivering projects (in the UK and abroad and we understand the complexity of getting something new installed and running. We have all dealt with significant projects, but obviously nothing approaching the complexity of Brexit. So naturally we ask each other what the Brexit project looks like compared other projects. Of course Brexit does not look like any project we have ever seen. No sane organisation would plan to introduce such a change in this way. So either the government is bluffing and has no intention of having No Deal, or the government has bluffed its way into a hole of its own making and does not know how to get out of No Deal. \nTo give just one example of why No Deal will be a mess, if Freedom of Movement really ends in October. One of my friends is an Italian with a UK Residents Permit, which says its valid until \"Indefinite\". Does she need the new UK \"Settled Status\" after Brexit? The Home Office web site says under \"Who Should Apply?\" that EU citizen need to apply \"even if you have a UK Permanent Residents Document\". If you follow the process it describes what some types of Permanent Residents Document might be, but none of them are called \"UK Residences Permit\", but it then says you don't need to apply if your document says \"indefinite\". So does my friend need to apply for \"Settled Status\" or not? \nAfter Brexit will immigration control recognize her very old \"UK Residences Permit\" allows her into the UK, will the NHS ask to see it if she goes for treatment, will he employer recognize this old document. The Home Office web sites makes it clear that valid documents come in all types, shapes and sizes, they have several valid names and at least some names that are not valid (e.g. if it says \"Document Certifying Permanent Residences\" that is good, but if it says \"Registration Certificate\" on it, that is no good.) \nSo how is a small business or a landlord supposed to distinguish between EU visitors who are only supposed to be in the UK for a few months, from EU citizen who intend being in the UK for a few years, from EU citizens who intend becoming permanent residents who have some sort of old residences document? As a former employer I had no idea what the difference was between a \"certificate of residences\" and \"Residences Permit\". Are employers required to check their employees status every few months?

I can't see what Corbyn describes happening as per his letter, but raising it now gives time for all MPs to come around to a sensible view of how to proceed.  A No Confidence process has to start with Corbyn calling for a No Confidence vote. Only the Leader of the Official Opposition can do that (No other MP including the PM can call for a No Confidence vote.) If Corbyn wins the vote a process would start to find out if any MP had the Confidence of the House. Corbyn might want it to be him, but he would be very unlikely to chosen.  The reason he is very unlikely to be chosen, is the same reason that MPs would vote to get rid of Johnson,  MPs who are not Labour MPs want to firstly stop a No Deal Brexit, and then have a referendum on Brexit with Remain as an option, and with a Brexit deal option that exists (e.g. the deal agreed my Mrs May or some variation of it). And then have a GE. What they don't want is another PM who talks about deals that don't exist and, is unclear if there would a public vote on any deal. They especially don't want a Labour Government, what they do want is a non-partisan caretaker government that's only policy is delivering a Brexit outcome that does the least economic and political damage.  Many (probably most) Labour MPs also want this.  A \"Labour Government\" would only have 247 MPs out of a total of 650 MPs so would be unable to govern without the support of other parties. Corbyn is not trusted by many Labour MPs and certainly is not trusted by non-Labour MPs. He has no experience in government. He is a divisive figure. Totally unsuited to being a neutral centrist caretaker. Conservative MPs in particular would not trust the competence of the people in Corbyn's Shadow Cabinet, a Corbyn PM would depend on the votes of Conservative, LibDems and SNP etc. MPs to govern. Its very unlikely that they would give Corbyn their votes.  I am not sure that even Corbyn believes in the idea that he could be a good caretaker PM.  So my view is that the Corbyn letter is not serious about him being PM and is not serious about having a Labour caretaker government. So why write it? My assumption is that people in the Labour Party want Corbyn to look as if he is trying to be PM, when its obvious that he won't get enough MPs to support his bid to be PM, Plan B can be tried.  A Caretaker Government that is formed to deal with one task needs to consist of people from as many parties as possible (to show that its non-partisan in everything except the one task) and it should have as PM a person who has no ambition to remain as PM after the one task is dealt with. A Caretaker PM should not then go on as Leader of a Party into a GE to try and become a majority party leader PM. It also needs to be a person whose political views are as close to the centre as possible   The possible outcomes from Corbyn's move are\n (a) he eventually stands aside, or is pushed aside and an Anti-No Deal Brexit government is formed. This would plan for a referendum, but would first need to extend A50 to give time for it to be held.     \n(b) A No Confidence vote is lost by Johnson, but MPs cannot agree on a new PM and Johnson carries on as PM. Not likely because MPs would presumably rather have the Downing Street cat as PM rather than a No Deal Brexit.\n(c) To stop losing a vote of No Confidence the PM could promise to extend A50 and hold a GE and/or a referendum. Also not likely, but more likely that option (b).  The other options of course still exist; No Deal Brexit, Mrs May's Deal or a variation is passed by parliament etc. but all are very unlikely as each one produces more problems than it solves. The problem with May's Deal is that it has no real Framework for Future Trade, and no NI border solution. The least damaging exit from the Brexit process is to have the public vote on either a specific detailed Brexit Deal (that includes a future trade framework and solves the NI border problem), or vote to Remain. \n   https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-49352250"], [67771, "2019-08-15T07:19:40Z", [0.01, 0.0, 0.23, 0.01, 0.44, 0.3, 0.01], "Continuing the analysis of analysis' in my previous forecast, but extremizing towards a vote of no confidence & a delay/date for a GE"], [78126, "2019-08-15T01:17:04Z", [0.02, 0.25, 0.4, 0.02, 0.09, 0.2, 0.02], ""], [2965, "2019-08-15T00:35:28Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [32438, "2019-08-14T21:49:16Z", [0.1, 0.05, 0.25, 0.05, 0.3, 0.05, 0.2], ""], [78091, "2019-08-14T19:17:05Z", [0.01, 0.01, 0.25, 0.02, 0.3, 0.4, 0.01], ""], [78124, "2019-08-14T18:03:44Z", [0.05, 0.15, 0.18, 0.02, 0.3, 0.3, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2019-08-14T18:03:18Z", [0.02, 0.02, 0.1, 0.02, 0.27, 0.55, 0.02], ""], [78125, "2019-08-14T17:23:44Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.0, 0.45, 0.4, 0.05], ""], [11200, "2019-08-14T17:05:21Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.9, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [11200, "2019-08-14T17:03:37Z", [0.0, 0.4, 0.6, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [37413, "2019-08-14T15:34:04Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.4, 0.15, 0.05, 0.2, 0.1], ""], [78112, "2019-08-14T13:50:04Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.9, 0.1, 0.0], "The new UK PM does not have the Parliamentary numbers to force through a NDB and the speaker of the HoC has stated that he will not allow the closure of Parliament to allow a NDB.

The Johnson backing newspaper the Daily Telegraph commissioned a set of opinion polls a few days ago and then tried to use the result of one question to show that the public supported a No Deal Brexit. \nThe Telegraph claimed that 54% backed No Deal. Many commentators have argued that the wording of the question was loaded and pointed out that the Telegraph had also adjusted the actual percentage by excluding the 20% who \"did not know\".\nThe pre-adjusted figure was 44% that agreed \"that Boris needs to deliver Brexit by any means possible including suspending if necessary in order to stop MPs from stopping it\". The question did not mention No Deal at all. ). \nThe more interesting results of this set of polls were for other questions.\nBrexit should be halted if problems over the NI border threaten to split the Union? 39% agreed, 37% disagreed\nAre you Concerned or Not Concerned about supplies of Fresh Food after No Deal? 53% Concerned, 40% not concerned.\nConcerned or No Concerned about supplies of medicine after No Deal? Concerned 59% not concerned 32%.\nAre you concerned about the cost of living increasing in the event of No Deal? Concerned 68% , not concerned 24% How loaded the questions are is the not my point here. What Johnson should be have noticed is that most of people polled believed that No Deal creates a lot of concerns. The majority of people don't want No Deal (other polls have shown that) and if he delivered No Deal and any of the concerns turned into real problems he would be in political trouble. Its a lot easier to be macho if you don't think about the consequences, but if the PM does something that does not work out well the PM gets the blame. \nSo I think Johnson will not allow No Deal regardless of parliament stopping him.\nMy personal view backed by no hard evidence, but looking at Johnson's body language is that he is looking very worried. His tactics of setting red lines before starting talks with the EU seems to have backfired, as did Mrs May's. Setting very public red lines makes it very difficult to get agreement because backing down is then also very public for both parties. Making threats to shoot yourself in the head is also not usually a good tactic, as it carries the high risk that your opponent will just let you go ahead. His only exit from the corner he has put himself in may to allow MPs to block No Deal, but to do so in way they they would be blamed by the significant minority of voters who don't mind No Deal.

However while the Conservatives lead the polls on voting intention if there was a GE, they are a long way short of the figures that would guarantee a Conservative win. (e.g. Conservatives on 31% now, at the 2017 GE they got 42% and did not get a majority, at the 2015 GE they got 37% and a majority). A more similar (to now) spread of votes was the 2010 GE when the  Conservatives got 36%, Labour got 29%, LibDems got 23%. At this election UKIP's support in the opinion polls almost disappeared at the actual GE. If the same were to happen to the Brexit Party in 2019 it is not clear if the Conservatives would pick up their votes or not. The Conservative Party has clearly changed since 2010 and its policies are very similar to the old UKIP (the Brexit Party does not have policies as such) so the Conservatives might pick up extra votes from the Brexit Party, but if the Brexit Party vote does not collapse it would split the vote of Brexit supporters. The 2010 GE still  resulted in a hung parliament  My conclusion is that a GE would be a very high risk for both Conservatives and  Labour, but Johnson has built up expectations. Most UK voters now expect Brexit to happen on 31st Oct and most of them expect it to be a No Deal Brexit (most voters don't want No Deal, but they expect it.) . If Johnson fails to deliver his credibility is shot. Most voters don't want the negotiated deal so if that happens voters will be unhappy. Most voters don't want No Deal (but expect it) so if that happens voters will be unhappy. No Deal has the potential to be noticeably bad. So the PM appears to have a big problem. A GE while ahead in the polls is an attractive idea  for the PM when delay is likely to be produce a worse result. But for individual MPs its not such an attractive idea when many of them are likely to lose their seats.  It looks as if a lot of sitting MPs could lose their seats in a GE because those supporting each party are in flux. The New Labour supporters are deserting the Labour Party. The liberal wing of the Conservative Party are deserting the Conservatives, so both are likely to lose seats where they have traditionally had strong support, even if they pick up some new ones in other places. The national opinion poll percentages for party support are misleading because voters are aligning in different ways to how they have previously.   It seems unlikely that a No Deal Brexit would happen before a GE is announced, because it seems inconceivable that the majority of voters would feel their lives had improved after a No Deal Brexit. Even the Brexiteers concede their will be \"bumps in the road for while\" after Brexit. So a GE after a No Deal (after the first day or so) would be hard for the Conservatives to win, as they would have to explain what the befits of the \"bumps in the road\" were, and they would have to explain to voters who had assumed that Brexit was the end of the process, that it was just the start of the new process of trying to do new trade deals, and trying to build new alliances,l and settling into a a new place in the world. None of this adjustment would be easy.   Its unlikely that the rush to invest in the new post Brexit reality will happen until the major new trade arrangements are implemented. How long that would take is anyone's guess. There could be a quick trade deal with the EU, but that would almost certainly only happen if it looked like being in the Single Market and Customs Union, if not its likely to take years to sort out (in the meantime business investment will have gone elsewhere.)

No other route looks feasible (e.g. a caretaker government) #2 The UK will leave the EU with a new or renegotiated version of a Withdrawal Agreement in place\nRenegotiation must include agreement from both the UK and EU. The UK government has asked for big pre-conditions for negotiations to re-start (dropping the backstop) and the EU government doesn\u2019t seem to be prepared to do so. However the chance of renegotiation is not trivial because enough time still remains for either party to change their mind. #3 The UK will leave the EU without a Withdrawal Agreement in place\nThis is currently the default option and the negotiation position of both parties seems to imply that this is the most likely outcome. However the sequence is important here, there is a non-trivial chance that while \u2018no deal\u2019 could be the eventual outcome, a date for General Election is set before this occurs. It is currently being discussed that a plausible scenario is that the Government loses the confidence vote (which means setting an election date) but pushes through a \u2018no deal outcome before election is held. #4 The UK will revoke Article 50\nThis is unlikely as was not a popular choice during the MP voting cycles so it doesn\u2019t look like there is majority in the parliament for this option without a new referendum. One remote scenario is that a caretaker government steps in to revoke, however that doesn\u2019t look plausible.  #5 The UK's Article 50 period will be extended beyond 31 October 2019\nAn extensio is a likely scenario since this was the previous route taken by the last PM. However there are three things that make it less likely. 1) Firm stance by the UK government to leave on 31 October. 2) Requirement of the EU to agree an extension and the fact that they might not agree if there is no line in sight for any changes to the position (Macron\u2019s argument), 3) Sequence of events might mean that the date for a General Election is set first and only then extension is given. I give it a fairly high probability as despite the points above, there could be a \u2018technical\u2019 extension of a few days / weeks to allow finalising negotiations for example. #6 The UK will set a date for a General Election\nEarly general election looks increasingly likely due to ever-diminishing majority of the UK government and the staffing decisions made (i.e. more focus on campaign than governing). There have also been a number of rumours / comments by people close to the government saying that election is likely to be called soon. That basic principle aside, the timing of setting an election date is crucial for that question and it is not obvious. For this option to be right, government either has to do it independently or through loss of a confidence vote (which looks to be planned for September). There seems to be a reasonable chance that an election might be on the cards, but the date is not set before other options occur. #7 The UK will set a date for a referendum on Brexit\nNew referendum is not a policy of either of the large parties so it is a low probability option. There are two \u2018wild card\u2019 scenarios that I see, either a caretaker government comes in and decides to hold a new referendum (instead of an election, - looks very unlikely) or due to PM\u2019s desperation to stay in power, he calls a new referendum and therefore stays in power until that date (also looks very unlikely)"], [5002, "2019-08-09T08:30:14Z", [0.1, 0.2, 0.45, 0.0, 0.05, 0.15, 0.05], ""], [77816, "2019-08-09T07:50:33Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.15, 0.5, 0.25], ""], [24028, "2019-08-09T06:45:02Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.1, 0.4, 0.0], ""], [66742, "2019-08-09T06:41:08Z", [0.0, 0.07, 0.16, 0.01, 0.46, 0.3, 0.0], ""], [77805, "2019-08-09T06:22:47Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.2, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1], "The eu have made it clear they wont negotiate"], [77806, "2019-08-09T06:21:51Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.05, 0.25, 0.15, 0.05], ""], [77800, "2019-08-09T06:09:54Z", [0.0, 0.3, 0.7, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [77797, "2019-08-09T05:36:46Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.25, 0.25, 0.0], ""], [77797, "2019-08-09T05:36:06Z", [0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.25, 0.0], ""], [77791, "2019-08-09T04:38:14Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [77784, "2019-08-09T03:14:46Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.9, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [77753, "2019-08-09T01:38:38Z", [0.0, 0.2, 0.8, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [72427, "2019-08-08T22:34:49Z", [0.02, 0.05, 0.35, 0.02, 0.28, 0.18, 0.1], ""], [63835, "2019-08-08T20:59:51Z", [0.01, 0.27, 0.2, 0.01, 0.4, 0.1, 0.01], "The EU would prefer an orderly w/d - but will take a no-deal w/d if handed to them. \nSo I think there is a heavy bias towards \"delay', and thus extending Article 50 past Oct 31.

Cummings (Johnson's advisor) is spreading a lot of misinformation. Presumably he is trying to provoke MPs into having a vote of No Confidence in Johnson in order to blame them for Johnson not delivering Brexit by the end of October. If a No Confidence vote is lost by the PM either Parliament will be able to find another PM who will Extend A50 (so that will be the first thing to happen) or it will lead to a GE, before or after the end of Oct. If the UK is heading for a GE either A50 is Extended first or the Date of the GE is set first. Leaving the EU without a Deal (No Deal) would only occur first if Parliament failed to win a No Confidence vote (i.e. did not hold a vote or Johnson won the vote) and Johnson allowed the UK to Leave the EU without any other action.\nI think Johnson is bluffing and would not want to Leave the EU on No Deal terms because while the Conservatives might reduce the attraction to (some) voters of the Brexit Party (and hope to pick up votes) a GE would probably be needed anyway (due to lack of Conservative MPs). A GE after a NO Deal Brexit is unlikely to go well for the Conservatives because while many voters say they support No Deal no one really knows how much much disruption No Deal would cause, but is seems fairly certain that some voters will find they are seriously negatively affected and its very unlikely that any voters will find that their lives have improved. In these circumstances it would be easy and logical of many voters to blame the Party and person that caused the problem and not vote for them. Obviously I could be totally wrong but Cummings is often described as very clever. As far as I can see his cleverness has not been in the field of negotiating deals, but in the field of using behavioral economics to influence voting, in much the same way that advertisers do. e.g. taking advantage of voters preferences to use automatic fast thinking rather than reflective slow thinking and using targeted ads to very small subsets of voters and carefully measuring which adverts get each sub-groups attention. In other words he is expert in doing the opposite of what Thaler and Sunstein's \"Nudge\" aims to do, which is \"Improve decisions about health, wealth and happiness\". What Cummings is aiming to do is take advantage of the human frailty whereby we prefer to take the lazy fast, but wrong choices (as per Homer Simpson) , to the taking of more difficult logical choices (as per Mr Spock). I don't see how his methods would be of any advantage in negotiating  with the EU. (But maybe he has other skills that I am not aware of.)

A Politics Home article [3] also touches on this issue quoting a \"senior Downing Street official\" as saying;\n\"Someone put Grieve\u2019s idea to Cummings on Friday that if we lose a vote of no confidence the PM will have to resign \u2014 he spat his drink out laughing.

Johnson has little incentive to call a referendum on Brexit. But  a referendum on \"no-deal\" is still a possible option.

Mirroring this the Conservative liberal wing support could continue its move to the LibDems.

If the Conservatives lose their Parliamentary majority (even including the DUP who are supporting them) drops to 1.

They can vote in EU elections and local elections. but not national elections. The numbers vary from year to year, but in 2017 only 3 EU countries were in the top 10 countries of migrant origins of people granted UK citizenship and the total number of EU nationals granted citizenship was only around 14,000. Hardly enough to swing any future votes.\nThose EU citizen that become UK citizens were mainly because they had married a UK citizen or they were EU citizens who were born in the UK.\nMost internal EU migrants do not intend remaining in the country where they are currently living for the rest of their lives. Most intend either returning to their native country or moving to whatever country offers them the best opportunities. I know many people who have done that, or are doing that. Its much like internal migration within the UK or within the USA. You see an opportunity, you move to where it is. It may be for a short term project or you may be there for years. The actual Brexit vote was:\n\"England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave.\"\nI don't know where you got your figures from for England? I have discussed the Brexit issues with lots of Leavers and Remainders, and I have asked contacts to ask other Leavers to ask specific questions on their attitudes, so I have quite a good idea what Leavers think. The issue of social changes comes up talking to Leavers and Remainers. The difference is that Remainers tend to not equate the changes with immigration, but with other factors and accept that things do change. The Leavers tend to be more upset by changes and are keen to blame someone or something for the changes. In some places the changes appear to be linked or at least coincide with the migration of EU citizens from Eastern Europe. So some examples; there have been changes to church attendances. The number of native British people attending church as been falling for many years. The Catholic Church (in particular) has had problems. In the Church of England the Church is far more liberal than many of the congregation, is, its attitude to gay people has changed, it has women and black ministers. I have been told by Catholics they don't like the fact that the church is now \"full of immigrants\". If the immigrants had not been there its probable that the church would have closed due to lack of a congregation. So we have a social change that few go to church (not due to immigrants) but rather than welcome the fact that the church only continues because of the immigrants they somehow blame the immigrants for the change. Of course as few Brexit voters actually go to church the immigrants don't really affect them, but (some) Brexit voters have said the social change to churches was a reason for wanting Brexit (even if does not affect them at). Many long establish chains of shops have closed. Leave voters tend to tell me that the closure of a high street shop makes them sad. This sadness has little to do with any inconvenience they may suffer from the shop being closed, because I have establish that they feel almost as sad when a shop they had never actually been a customers of closes, as they do when a shop they actually use closes. If the long established shop gets replaced by a new shop with a foreign name or it sells foreign stuff the Leavers equate the old shop closing to the increase of immigrants. The reality is that the old shops are closing because retailing is moving online. Its a similar picture with banks. Almost all the banks in small town have been closed in the last ten years. Not because of immigrants but because their customers use the branches less because most people bank online. The Leavers tend to get angry or sad about it. The Remainers tend to be a bit irritated that on the rare occasions when they might want to visit a bank they can't, but they realise that the closure was because people like them had stopped using the branch, so they shrug and carry on using internet banking. Pubs have closed in large numbers. There are few of the old fashioned traditional pubs left. What has replaced them are family restaurants and coffee shops. For those who used to spend their leisure time smoking and drinking in their local pub things have changed a lot. With smoking banned inside they have sit outside. The reason for the changes are customers don't want to go to the old pubs, society has changed but not due to immigrants. Old businesses have closed, repairs shops hardly exist, heavy industry declined decades ago, now light industry is in decline the Leavers find this upsetting, Remainers see this as inevitable change. Its got nothing to do with immigration, but Leavers tend to equate change with immigration So my point is two things have happened at roughly the same time, changes and EU immigration. In many cases they are not related at all, but Leavers tend to treat the coincidence as if it was the cause. Is there any other evidence? I think there is. This idea of linking things that happen at about the same as being due to the same cause, when its not is not new. In 1516 the Spanish Royal line ended and was replaced by the Habsburg Charles V who came from what is now Belgium. May civil servants went from Flanders with him to Spain. At about the same time migrants who were originally from India arrived in Spain having crossed from North Africa. They brought with them a style of singing, dancing and music. The Spanish public assumed that the arrival of this new music had been brought by Charles V, so they called it Flamenco (or Flemish). In the US when Trump was elected his supporters seem to have had a similar issue with the changes to their lives as the Brexit voters did in the UK. But in the US there was no big increase in immigration to the areas where people voted for Trump. So we have two groups of people, one in the UK, one in the US, who felt that their lives were changing for the worse. The group in the UK blamed the changes on Eastern European immigration, the US group blamed it on other things that they could not control. My point is that if the reason to Leave the EU was immigration, stopping immigration from the EU is not going to help the Leavers with the real problems they have. Leaving the EU is not going to bring Woolworths back or bring back smoke filled pubs, or fill the churches with native Englanders.

Leave w/ May's Deal: 1% (4\u2193)\n - Seems to be effectively a non-starter on both sides of the isle. Certainly not impossible, but very unlikely. Leave w/ Renegotiated: 0% (5\u2193)\n - This is very unlikely given the timeline, however given BoJo's hardline towards a no-deal Brexit I see this as effectively impossible (to happen first). Leave w/o a deal: 25% (20\u2191)\n - I see this as being one of the more likely outcomes given BoJo's persistence on a no-deal route. It's certainly not a given yet but with time running down there are limited options remaining. Wildcard here is the possibility of a vote of no-confidence in order to avoid such a route. Revocation of A50: 1% (4\u2193)\n - Again technically not impossible, but this appears not to be a practicable option. Extension of A50: 35% (19\u2191)\n - Swapping likely order w/ the option of setting a date for a referendum. Setting of a Date for a GE: 33% (7\u2193)\n - This is a tricky one & I'm not entirely sure how the progression would look here, but I see the primary path towards this option now as being similar to the order of setting a date for a referendum. AKA it is unlikely that this would occur before an extension of A50, unless...\n - Unless a vote of no-confidence against BoJo passes... In this event I would see the progression as [Vote of NC \u2192 Date for GE set \u2192 Extension to A50 \u2192 Date for Referendum set]. If a NC vote is raised & passed this becomes my all in option, and I will look to increase the likelihood on this significantly. Setting of a Date for a Referendum: 5% (20\u2193)\n - From what I can decipher it is impossible to hold such a referendum w/o an extension to A50 as such a referendum would take 22 weeks to hold. Thus the only question here is could a date be set on the premise that an extension was imminent but not yet officially granted? I view this as highly unlikely but not impossible tl;dr...\n - Only real progression I see are (in order of likelihood) 1a) BoJo pushes for a no-deal Brexit & triggers a vote of no-confidence. Vote passes & an extension is requested & granted in the immediate aftermath, followed by a date for a GE & referendum\n1b) BoJo pushes for a no-deal Brexit & triggers a vote of no-confidence.

I'm very appreciative to @Tetbury, @cafebedouin, @nigster and others who have set me straight on a number of facets of it. So, here's my current thinking:  from least likely to occur first (#7) to most likely to occur first #7 REVOKE. 0% (no change)  @Chrisp says that there are sufficient Remainers in Parliament that they could Revoke without election.  Maybe, in theory, but the fact that this hasn't happened suggests to me that it won't, because so many of the MPs who are Remainers represent folks who are Leavers.  I think it's more likely there'll be a No Deal Brexit or a referendum, or one of the other options, than that A50 will be revoked. #6 LEAVE W/ May's WA:  0% (no change)  As @Tetbury says, \"May's deal is actually the nearest to what voters were told Brexit would be by many of the leaders of the Leave campaigns\" but Parliament isn't going to go for it after having voted it down 3x.  There will have to be an extension first to hold a referendum on it or there will first have to be a GE to get a new parliament to vote for it.   #5 LEAVE W/ new WA: very difficult, but not impossible. 3% (no change)  Other forecasters have pointed out that it seems that the EU thinks No Deal would be the worst outcome, so even though the EU has repeatedly said that they won't negotiate further, they probably will.  As @Chrisp points out:  \"On a No-deal Brexit, the backstop is gone. So the question for the EU is this: is an orderly withdrawal without the backstop better than a disorderly withdrawal.\"    Or perhaps the new PM can wrangle some minor superficial changes so that he can call it \"new and improved\" WA.  It can't happen before 10/31, and is likely to require an extension, so it would not be the option from this list that happens first.    #4 LEAVE W/NO DEAL.  Is an increasing possibility given what the PM continues to say.  16% (no change) I am totally confused about who--the PM? Parliament?--can stop a No Deal Brexit.  If I understand @Tetbury correctly, Parliament may be able to block a No Deal Brexit and @cafebedouin says  Parliament can stop a No Deal Brexit by changing the law, but @Tetbury later said:  \"Assuming [AG] Cox is right and parliament cannot stop No Deal Brexit, a PM pushing it through just because he could not be stopped would not look too good on the PMs CV unless the No Deal was such a great and instant success that the pubic forgot it. My guess a PM who did this would become an even bigger hate figure for all those affected than Margaret Thatcher became. They say that Johnson is (rather like Trump) a man with no friends who longs to be loved by people. Would he want his legacy to be the most hated PM in living memory?\" Clearly, however, there's no way that the EU can stop a No Deal Brexit. #3 SET a DATE for a REFERENDUM.   16% (decreased from 33%)  Some scenarios in which there may be a 2nd referendum are: -progress has been made in negotiations and there's a new WA, but Parliament won't go for this new WA. Since there seems to be public support for the \"right kind\" of Brexit and the PM may be most reluctant to call a GE to try to get the votes in Parliament, rather than call a GE, the PM might call for a referendum. -all other avenues have been blocked: Parliament has voted to deny the PM the right to leave with no deal, or the EU won't give the UK an extension so it can complete negotiations on a new WA; (however, in this situation the request for an extension would have come first).  -to deflect blame/responsibility from the PM and Parliament.   -with No Deal looming, the public clamors for a vote . . .  -It  make some sense to have a national vote again even though May's WA has been voted down by Parliament 3x.\nHowever, the idea of a 2nd referendum is outrageous  in the minds of Leavers.  @nigster says, \". . . .to brexiteers a second referendum is a betrayal of democracy. If there was a 2nd ref. it would make me question everything about this country that I was brought up to believe. If politicians are our rulers not our representative, if they can override a clear democratic vote, then what next? The government loses an election but says \"those stupid working class people didn't know what they were voting for so they must vote again\". Or \"the opposition lied so lets vote again\". Or \"most of the people who voted against the government didn't go to university so we must vote again\". Where does that end? . . .  The most depressing and also the scariest thing to me about brexit is that smart and decent friends of mine who voted remain do not see that making people vote again is wrong. . . .  All of the leave voters would be utterly outraged by a 2nd ref.  . . \"   @cafebedouin has convinced me that if the PM or Parliament wanted to hold a referendum, it would get the EU to agree to an extension while it worked out the language, set the date, etc for the referendum, so setting a date for a referendum would not happen until an extension had been requested & granted. #2 SET A DATE for a GE:  30% (increased from 26%) The PM may not want to do this as polls & recent election results seem to suggest that his party would lose many seats.  (See @Tetbury for a more comprehensive analysis of this.)   If the polls changed, all bets are off!  Also, if threatened by a No Deal Brexit or forced to form a new government by a no confidence vote, this may be seen as the least bad option. @nigster says:  \"One possibility that exists (but I have hardly seen mentioned in the media) is that a GE is triggered by the opposition but Boris simply sets a date for the election such that we leave on 31 October then the election happens shortly afterwards.\"   This scenario, then, has setting a date first, followed by Brexit, then an election. @nigster also said:  \"The Fixed Term Parliaments Act sets a minimum time from triggering a GE to polling day but it leaves setting the date of the GE to the discretion of the Prime Minister. A Times article today said that Attorney General Geoffrey Cox is understood to believe that there is no legal basis to prevent the prime minister from taking Britain out of the EU, even if October 31 arrives amid a general election campaign triggered by a no-confidence vote in the government over no-deal.\" @Chrisp also says: \"The PM (and the queen) lost that ability [to call a GE]   with the fixed parliaments act.\" Will there be a vote of Confidence, when, and how will BJ fare?   @Tetbury says:  \"Only the Leader of the Opposition can call for a Vote of No Confidence in the Government.\nConservative MPs can choose to remove Johnson from being their Leader, but that does not stop him being the PM.\" @Chrisp says, \"Right now the conservatives have enough votes to block a no confidence vote - however several conservatives have said they will vote to bring down the government in the event of a no deal Brexit. . . . There is nothing to prevent a no-confidence vote - except that right now a lot of tories, and quite a few labor know that it will end their political careers.\" @Tetbury sums it up thusly (edited):  \". . . the PM can no longer just call an election.  He has to get MPs to vote for it with a 2/3 majority, and [then] the PM would be able to set the date of a GE. Or the Labour opposition has to first win a Vote of No Confidence and then if no alternative candidate for PM can win a Confidence Vote the PM has to call a GE. It seems that many forecasters see this as the option most likely to be in play in the short term even though the PM and many MPs will/could lose their positions if one occurs.  @cafebedouin suggests that the PM\" might use an election tactically as a surprise move to prevent Parliament from taking any action against a no deal Brexit,\" or \"to change the composition of Parliament to pass May's deal.\" #1 EXTEND.  35% (increased from 22%) The EU and a majority in the UK & Parliament do not want a no-deal Brexit. An extension could be necessary (and palatable to the PM) if there appeared to be some possibility of negotiations becoming fruitful. It would also be needed if there was to be a referendum (since they take 22 weeks to hold).  If there is going to be a GE, the UK & EU might opt for an extension rather than have a No Deal Brexit.   THIS MUST HAPPEN BEFORE 10/31 IF IT IS TO HAPPEN AT ALL. The likelihood of it is linked to the progress of negotiations with the EU; if progress is being made, I don't think the UK will ask for it until the last minute.   @cafebedouin has convinced me that even a last-minute request by the UK for an extension will get through the EU, as \"there's no way the EU is going to set themselves up as the bad guy if an extension is asked for and not granted\". As @Chrisp suggests, \" . . . one way Extend happens is the PM loses a noconf and Remainer Tories and Labor form a government.\" @cafebedouin has said for an extension to happen, 1) Parliament must pass legislation that changes the October 31 date or  2) after a no confidence vote some kind of caretaker government is formed with the sole purpose of changing the deadline. But @Chrisp counters:  \"I don't agree think it is settled that Parliament can change the extend date. Remember, Theresa May changed the date without Parliament, and that's because an official government or head of state is what's required. Parliament - regardless of what laws it passes - is neither of those.\" All of this adds up to muddy waters for me! From my perspective it seems that every side in this situation has done its best to erect a wall to prevent others from achieving their goals.  Linked together, all of these walls have left no maneuvering room, no space for compromise, no common ground.  Everyone's hands are tied by their own words/actions or those of their opposition.  So, which walls will be the most fiercely defended?  which will be breached?  Who will release themselves from the bonds/commitments that they have made?

SETTING A DATE for a referendum is not a complex process, as far as I know.   (Actually creating the ballot is, however!)   It can happen any time prior to any of the leave options.  If the PM gets a new deal, but can't muster the votes in Parliament for it and doesn't want to hold a GE, he might call a referendum.  He might even call a referendum on May's WA to deflect blame from himself if Brexit is rough.  Increase from 0 to 33%  (This is a reversal of my thinking because maybe it does make sense to have a national vote again even though May's WA has been voted down by Parliament 3x.)

The question they are asking is when will the GE be.  Johnson has said there will definitely be no GE before 31st Oct, but (the media say) this could be part of the mind games that the PM's election team is playing, and of course we know that May said there would be no GE in 2017 and then went for a walk one day and changed her mind. So I am ignoring what the PM says. If it looked as if Johnson could win an election I am sure he would not bother with what he said yesterday. What is more likely stopping Johnson calling a GE is that currently it looks as if the Conservatives would loose seats, not gain them. The polls (for a GE)  show the Conservatives on only 25% (at the last GE they got 42%) there has been no Boris bounce so far.  If the polls are not to be believed there is also the evidence from an actual election to consider. On Thursday (day 2 for the new PM) a  two small local elections took place in Gloucestershire (for the local Council). In each constituency there were Conservative, Labour, LibDems, Greens, UKIP and Brexit Party candidates (the first time the Brexit Party had stood for a domestic election). Of interest was how would the new Brexit Party do and how would it affect the Conservative and Labour vote.  One of these seats had been held by the Conservatives. This seat was won by the LibDems, with the Conservatives well behind in second place and the Brexit P. a long way behind that. Even if the Conservative, Brexit P, and (tiny) UKIP votes were added together the LibDems would have still won. Presumably this had been a Conservative area that did not like way Brexit was going. The other seat had been held by Labour, it was also won by the LibDems, just ahead of the Conservatives, with Labour third just ahead of the Brexit Party. My guess is that this area had been Labour Pro-Brexit and that Labour lost votes to the LibDems (from anti-Brexit Labour voters).  Its clearly complicated as voters are shifting from the Right/Left division to Inclusive/exclusive (or liberal/illiberal, or Leave/Remain however you want to define it) but what is clear is that figuring out what the result of a GE when the Cons are polling 25%, the LibDems are on 23%, Labour is on19%, the Brexits are on 17% and the Greens are on 9%, is very difficult. The LibDems are working with other parties (Greens and PC) in local pacts, which adds to the complication. What does seems clear is that calling a GE when you are only polling 25% would be unlikely to give you a majority in Parliament. But the possibilities of tactical voting and local pacts are endless, and too many to explore here.  (If there was a Conservative/Brexit Party pact (or a LibDem/Green pact) would voters actually vote for a party they did not support just because it was in a pact?) However my main reasons for thinking a GE before November is very unlikely is that it would need to be called by mid-September, Before mid-September it seems unlikely that the PM could claim that a GE is needed because the EU is refusing to negotiate with the UK, or because \"remoaners\" are blocking a No Deal Brexit. According to the truth (according to the Brexit Believers) the EU always gives you want you want at the last minute. The \"last minute\" will not have arrived before mid-September. For similar reasons the \"last minute\" to stop No Deal will not have arrived by mid-September, so that can't be the reason for calling a GE.  I presume that Dominic Cummings will try and provoke anti-Brexiteers into taking some action that can then be blamed for stopping Johnson from achieving his target of Brexit by the end of October. I also presume that the anti-Brexiteers and the anti-No Dealers (two different groups) are well aware of this and will try and avoid giving Johnson the excuse that he had to Extend A50 because his No Deal Brexit was blocked. I note that the latest Sky Poll on people's preferred Brexit outcome (24th July) shows 41% prefer to Remain in the EU, 15% would prefer a deal similar to the May Deal, and 26% would prefer to Leave the EU with No Deal, (17% had no opinion). Since January this poll has shifted with 3% more preferring to Remain,  5% fewer wanting a Brexit Deal like May's and 3% fewer wanting No Deal.  It would be brave PM who would risk a No Deal Brexit when 76% of voters don't support it. (I know there are other polls that have other conclusions).    So things could change but today I think a GE very unlikely, but not impossible.

To an electorate that can see problems everywhere Johnson's idea of tackling everything energetically has appeal.  His problems are that he has a very small majority, lots of enemies in his own party (as well as no support outside his party in parliament) and that he has promised to deliver Brexit by the end of October. The obvious move would be to call a GE hoping that his mood of optimism is contagious and that he can ride this wave to get a big enough majority so that his Conservative enemies can't block him by working with other parties. If he called a GE today its possible that there could be a GE in early September, and if he got a big majority it would boost his chances of hitting his 31st October target. If he does not call a GE today then he would need to recall parliament in order to have the vote to trigger a GE or wait until parliament restarts in September.   A similar timing issue would affect parliament trying to force a GE, The bottom line is if the GE process is not started today the results of a GE would be known until late October. So as a means of helping deliver Brexit by the end of October a GE is not likely to help unless the GE was held in early September. A GE in October would probably not be helpful to Johnson. By then presumably his new ministers will be setting out how they will be sorting out all the UKs problems, but none of the problems will be sorted out. So its just the time when the media will be probing their plans and picking holes in them. For example if Mrs May had called a GE for September 2016 after she had given her speech saying she planned to solve all the UK's problems she might have increased her majority, but she held it in 2017 after saying how she intended to solve social care. The public likes the idea of solving the problem, but does not like any of the means of doing it (just like Brexit).   Advisors such as Dominic Cummings might be willing to shake things up by recalling parliament during the summer, so that Johnson can get a GE vote through. So there is a scenario where a GE takes place in early September, its very high risk, but getting it done before the inevitable reaction to the optimistic mood sours might make it worthwhile. The optimism will sour because like everyone else Johnson says he want change, but has not fleshed what the changes will entail. If everyone agreed what the answers to the problems were, the previous government would have already implemented the changes. So clearly whatever the Johnson government's solutions turn out to be, will be seen by many MPs (and voters) as negatives, Its far more popular to say you will \"fix the housing problem\" and \"fix the social care problem\" than to actually do it.  The other GE date scenario is to set the date after 31st October. That is a lot more likely, but would either be because the UK had left the EU with a deal, or had left with No Deal. I don't see how Johnson would get the existing deal thru parliament and I don't see the how a new deal could be negotiated in time. Also I don't see why if Brexit was about to happen why parliament would want a GE that would be too late to change the form of Brexit. So a GE after October is only likely if an A50 extension had been agreed.

Boris Johnson makes a claim that purports to illustrate what is wrong with the EU; - that its a over bureaucratic organization that unilaterally imposes pointless rules on hard working citizens and takes away sovereignty from democratic national parliaments. And leaving the EU will bring back control to the UK. The story of the EU's rules of selling kippers is totally untrue, so why did Boris say what he said? Because saying things that are untrue is part of Boris's nature, he can't really help himself making up stories. Its what story tellers do, they make up stories to entertain. Audiences enjoy hearing about authorities creating stupid rules. If Johnson had wanted to he could easily have checked to see if the EU actually had set up the kipper postage laws, but he didn't. He didn't because it suited his purpose to make up a story. The truth is a lot less entertaining than Boris's story. The kippers are packed as they are in order to reduce the risk of the consumer getting food poisoning as smoked fish can be infected by listeria if not well packed. But a story that kippers are sent in protective packing to avoid listeria will not entertain many people. The fact that the packaging rules are set by the UK Government and are nothing to do with EU laws will not excite Brexiteers as they want to hear that the EU stops the UK doing things or makes the UK do things. The fact that the Isle of Man from where the kippers were sent is neither in the EU or UK shows that if you want to export to another country you have to follow the rules of that country. So the real story is that the Isle of Man's sovereignty over kipper exports has been overriden by the UK, and if the UK was outside the EU and wanted to export to it, it would still need to obey the laws of the countries it was exporting to. So this is typical of Boris's Brexit arguments; facts twisted and blended with things that are untrue, facts that are made up. Disregard for truth and accuracy.\nThey are just entertaining stories. As Boris is likely be PM by the end of next week, now he knows that changing the rules on packaging kippers is something that the UK PM has total sovereignty to do, I expect to hear that he has made it a priority to deregulate how kippers are sold to the public. The freedom for kipper retailers to poison their customers is a right that its obviously worth going back to. So what difference to this question does the kipper issue make?\nI think it shows how unreliable Johnson is. It shows he is too lazy to do anything that requires any work, such as checking the facts. His character is that he needs instant gratification (getting a laugh is an instant hit). I expect he will have not progressed Brexit at all by the end of October. So as long as Parliament can stop him doing anything really stupid before they throw him out nothing will happen.  (I hope I don't seem biased on this question!

A vote on the Northern Ireland Bill showed that MPs could (probably) stop a No Deal Brexit. I am going to assume that Johnson becomes the next PM. The TV debate yesterday gave a good idea of his thinking. I see no chance of any version of WA emerging before November that the Conservative ERG would vote for, so the Conservatives alone could not get it thru parliament. Labour would only vote for a WA if the bill included a Public Vote. A Public Vote could not happen before November, Therefore I agree with @Anneinak. the two WA options cannot happen.\n(I don't see any chance of enough rebel Labour MPs voting with the PM to get a WA thru parliament if the Conservative ERG vote against. It seems a difficult sell to get Labour MPs to vote for a WA without a Public Vote that their party is willing to vote for if it includes a Public Vote.) Both Johnson and Hunt convinced me in yesterday's debate that the No Deal \"preparations\" are just bluster. Any one who thinks you could create new border control system in a couple of months is either bluffing (unconvincingly) and/or has never been involved in designing, producing and rolling out any sort of system. Unless we assume the majority of MPs are totally irresponsible it will not happen.   It has been claimed that Johnson might call a GE immediately he becomes PM. I think this is very unlikely. He made it clear in the debate that his whole objective is to be PM (Brexit was his means to become PM) and would not commit to resigning if he failed to leave the EU before November. As both the Conservatives and Labour are only polling at around 20% to 25% support it would be stupid for them to agree to have an election soon, as both parties would likely lose a significant proportion of MPs and the result would almost certainly be a hung parliament  (and they would need to agree to get MPs to vote for an election). If Johnson or parliament waited to see how negotiations with the EU went it would be too late to have an elections before November and then do anything. So in that case an extension to A50 would need to agreed with the EU before setting a GE date.  The case for having a Second Referendum is similar to having a GE. An SR could not happen before November (the minimum period seems to 22 weeks after calling it) so presumably the UK would decide, in principle, have a SR, go to the EU ask to extend A50 and when the EU agreed it would set a date.  (I guess the PM could go to the EU and say \"we intend to have a SR\" on a particular date, but \"setting\" the date I assume means setting the date in law.)   So we are left with Revoking or Extending. (I have already rejected No Deal). Revoking is the emergency option that parliament might have to apply if a PM refused to ask the EU to Extend A50. Surely Revoking A50 would be the end of Brexit and of Johnson as PM. Extending A50 would be a very bad outcome for Johnson, but he could dress it up as someone else's fault,  So I am going for 100% Extend A50  "], [75949, "2019-07-10T05:38:07Z", [0.1, 0.1, 0.05, 0.05, 0.6, 0.05, 0.05], ""], [484, "2019-07-09T23:55:38Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.01, 0.15, 0.55, 0.15, 0.13], "Convinced by @Anneinak argument about whether any of the leave options can really occur before 1 Nov."], [13158, "2019-07-09T20:55:19Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.2, 0.5, 0.25], ""], [38, "2019-07-09T19:41:29Z", [0.0, 0.03, 0.06, 0.0, 0.48, 0.43, 0.0], "@nigster, @Tetbury, @dowser, @Emil, @Jim2 I don't have the brain wattage that you guys have so I focus on simple things like the words in the question.  This question asks what will happen FIRST. All of the leave options--with the May WA, a new WA or no WA--all can't/won't happen until Nov 1st.  What can happen before that?  revoking A50, extending A50,  and setting dates for a GE or referendum.  Right? Since revoking A50 requires action only on the UK side, it would, theoretically, be quicker to achieve than extending A50 which requires EU agreement, as well. Now, what are the processes for setting a date for a GE and a referendum?  Which process can be faster?  It sounds to me like setting a date for a GE could be much faster than setting a date for a referendum, since the process of defining what the referendum will be on is so much more complicated than the process for calling a GE, either at the behest of the PM/government, or through a vote of no-confidence. So, POLITICS ASIDE, I see the sequence (first to last) as\nset a date for a GE\nrevoke A50\nextend A50\nset a date for a referendum\nall leave options Now, I add in the politics. \n\nSetting a date for a referendum seems highly unlikely because there's no agreement in sight about what the referendum would be on.  So, that option drops to even after all of the leave options, I think. Revoking A50 is also highly unlikely.  May's not going to do it.  Neither BJ or Hunt would do it.  Parliament won't vote for it.  There'd have to be a GE first.  So, that option falls on the list to after the leave options, too. There's several plausible scenarios which would result in date being set for a GE.   What will the new PM do:  will he call a GE?  Will parliament force him to?   Would BJ call a GE?   I think he'd not want to call a GE, but his hand may be forced by parliament to do so.\n\n Extending A50 is possible, too, but would it be preferable to the PM or parliament?   If the new PM was for it, then it could happen before a GE was announced or before the leave options.  What does BJ say about extending A50?   It seems to me that what the UK does best is kick the can.  Extending A50 would allow everyone to save face and to continue to promise Brits that Brexit will enable them to have their cake and eat it too. That means that it looks to me like when politics are considered the sequence of events could be\nextend A50\nset a date for a GE  \nleave:  with May's WA, a new WA or no WA\nset a date for a referendum\nrevoke A50 But I'm not too sure of that, or much anything else, either. . ."], [62808, "2019-07-09T18:55:56Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.0, 0.57, 0.41, 0.01], ""], [1333, "2019-07-09T18:14:38Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.2, 0.34, 0.21], ""], [41373, "2019-07-09T17:18:15Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.17, 0.0, 0.28, 0.41, 0.14], "Thanks @dowser, @Tetbury, @nigster for your responses on dating an election.

However if BoJo moves to precipitate an election (confidence motion or fan-dangling a non-confidence motion) he may well not get the mandate from Parliament. Meanwhile, Corbyn would (or should) only want an election as a last resort to derail Brexit as defined currently. If he initiates a non-confidence motion he may well succeed. \n22.2: If there is non-confidence and we move on to an election it is unlikely that a new government will be formed before Halloween (October 31st). \u201cThe Right Thing\u201d would be for the acting PM to request an extension to A50 and for EU to accept, with a sigh.

Thanks to @Emil @cafebedouin @Anneinak and others for clarifying that the referendum date would be set only after deliberation on the question. In all probability the EU will be asked for extension during this time, and again they will likely accept with a sigh. However, they may demand the question and the date first, depending on when the request is made, and they may say No; revoke first (!)\n22.4: BoJo\u2019s posturing about re-negotiation is a sham, and may be a delaying tactic to stall the discouraging but necessary agreements for a well-managed hard exit. If no referendum or election is called first, then there may be an extension towards the end of October to finalize the details. Will the details constitute a \u201cnew Withdrawal Agreement\u201d?

I perceive Boris Johnson to have a relationship with facts and truth that is similar to DJT's, so, I do not see him having any trouble putting lipstick on the pig (the WA) and calling it a New WA.  However, it's been pointed out that even putting lipstick on the pig will involve a lot of steps, and though the charismatic salesman BJ might be able to sell it to the public, MPs might be a much harder sell.  Also, there is the time factor for getting all the steps completed for a New WA.  So:  reducing my forecast for a New WA from 20 to 13. The forecasters I've cited have also convinced me that BJ might voluntarily call a GE or be forced to, so I'm increasing my forecast for setting a date for a GE, from 9 to 17%. However,  I'm reminded that this question will resolve on the basis of which happens FIRST, so maybe I've got my forecasts for extending A50 and calling a GE in the reverse order.  Would the UK ask for an extension of A50 BEFORE it set a date for a GE or a referendum?  Wouldn't the UK argument for an extension of A50 be that we are having a GE or referendum?  So, wouldn't setting a date for either one of them have to happen first?

They can't do that before 4th Sep, (I assume a vote of No Confidence in Mrs May would be pointless because she has already said she is resigning)  because the process for forcing a General election requires two No Confidence votes two weeks apart and Parliament will be closed from 25 July to 3 Sept (Mrs May is expected to remain PM until 23 July).

The full quote from \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\"  is: Someone had blundered.\n   Theirs not to make reply,\n   Theirs not to reason why,\n   Theirs but to do and die.\n   Into the valley of Death\nRode the six hundred. The Charge of the Light Brigade did not work out well.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_of_the_Light_Brigade Blundering and not reasoning why, certainly fits Boris and his fans approach. Its difficult to disentangle what the two candidates for PM will actually try to do about Brexit from what they would like to do in their dreams. Both dream that they will  go and ask the EU to remove the Irish backstop from the WA, so that the pure Brexiteers will help the UK Parliament pass the WA legislation. There seems no evidence that the EU has any plan to just scrap the backstop without replacing it with some similar e.g. that NI only stays in the EU Customs Union and EU Single Market until a totally open, but totally secure solution to the border with Ireland is found, while Britain (UK minus NI) is outside the CU and SM. As most Conservative Party members have told pollsters that  they would not be bothered if NI (or Scotland) left the UK, they would be presumably be happy with Britain outside the EU while NI was in a backstop. But the same is not true of the DUP MPs who would not vote for any Brexit deal that changed the status of NI vis a vis Britain. Without the DUP's vote the Conservatives cannot get the WA thru parliament unless some other party backed it.  Even if the WA was agreed by MPs it would be difficult to get all the legislation through before 31st Oct (as there are only 20 sitting days between now and 31 Oct.  It seems very unlikely that EU would drop the Irish backstop, unless Ireland agreed because EU politicians need to show they are  backing the remaining members rather than helping the UK, that is leaving.  I don't think that either Johnson or Hunt are bright enough to see that their only hope of staying as PM is to call a General Election or another Referendum. The Referendum would need to be on Accepting the WA as is or Revoking A50. The chances of them staying as PM are pretty low in any event, but not doing one of these things will almost certainly be fatal to their chances of remaining as PM.  (A smart PM who had not said he would \"do or die could have engineered matters so that \"the people\" could solve Brexit in a vote. If No vote, then it will be Blame the PM.) So given that Johnson (or Hunt) will almost certainly not get what they want, what will they do when that becomes clear? The myth that Brexiteers hold dear is that the EU always folds at the last minute so presumably whoever is PM will hold out until 31 Oct waiting for the EU to fold. As most Conservative MPs say they \"believe\" (in Brexit, in the myth that the EU will fold, that No Deal is not a bad outcome) they will not want to sound the alarm before the PM's ship has hit the rocks because if they do try and stop the PM and succeed the Brexiteers will claim that if they had waited another few minutes the EU would have folded. This will be a dilemma for those MPs that think a No Deal will be a very bad outcome. \nI could see midnight on 31Oct being reached with nothing being done. At that point there are still options. The EU could stop the clock and give UK the option of going thru with crashing out, or Revoking A50 or extending A50 again. Revoking A50 would destroy the PM, Extending A50 would destroy Johnson if he were PM, Crashing Out would probably destroy the Conservative Party and the PM.

The MP says Johnson has assured him that the WA will not be renegotiated, it will merely have a few words  added to the Backstop section, which the MP considered too small a change to count as renegotiation. While the studio guests argue if this is or is not renegotiation, a tweet is sent by Steve Baker who is also a Johnson for PM supporter  to say that he has been promised, by Johnson, several other changes to the WA in particular that the European Court of Justice will not have any role during the 2 year implementation period. \nIt seems likely that Johnson is promising different things to each MP that will vote for him to be PM. \nSo now travel forward a few weeks and Johnson is PM and he goes to the EU (and lets assume they agree to discuss the WA) does he say \"I don't need to renegotiate the WA I just need a one line change to the Backstop\"? My guess is that either the EU just say \"No\" or they say \"if we agree this one line change can you guarantee  you can get it thru Parliament?\" If Johnson says \"yes\" and the EU agree to the change, but then Baker and ERG (Conservatives) refuse to vote for it because they demand more changes, the EU wil tell Johnson to take a hike. If Johnson says \"No\" the EU will certainly tell Johnson to take a hike. As the EU is as capable as I am of watching BBC TV they already know that Johnson is telling different supporters different things and that what ever he asked for from the EU will be rejected by at least some Conservative MPs (and almost all non-Conservative MPs) so nothing short of full renegotiation of WA with nothing hidden so no last minute surprises arise, will produce a WA that Parliament will vote thru, and that WA would need cross party support not rely on just the Conservative Party MPs and DUP MPs. It would only take a handful of Conservatives to block any version of a WA as too hard or too soft (especially likely with Johnson as PM). There is not time to do a complete renegotiation of the WA before November even if the EU wanted to. To pretend otherwise is setting things up for a certain failure. So as far as I am concerned Johnson might as well be written off now because his statement that agreeing the WA is feasible before November can only happen if he has a way of getting Parliament to vote for Mrs Mays's WA.

I will list my reasons for the likelihood of each one, but I think there are only two main things that will happen, given we have 133 days as I write this question, but 101 from the 22nd July, the date when the UK *will* have a new Prime Minister (could happen sooner), and the proposed leaving date of 31st October. 1. The UK will leave the EU with the November 2018 Withdrawal Agreement in place - Parliament returns on 1st September from its summer recess. This assumption is that the new PM tries to pass the previous PMs deal which is a/not their own b/already failed three times with a more important deadline, March 29th. I don't think that a new PM could not at least try a renegotiation over the summer, and the new deal would be have to be passed by the commons and the lords before the 31st . Or the new PM tries to pass the Mays deal, which it will not pass through the commons with the current makeup of parliament.\n2. The UK will leave the EU with a new or renegotiated version of a Withdrawal Agreement in place. This is what the new PM will probably want to try to do, but time would not be on his (all the candidates left are male) side, and therefore in order to do this would need a mechanism to get more time.\n3. The UK will leave the EU without a Withdrawal Agreement in place. This is not what the candidates left want to propose, and the EU would also not want this outcome. Although the Brexit party may want to see this happen, Parliament and the negotiators have a lot of incentives to avoid this and have already demonstrated they can come up with extensions to avoid this.\n4. The UK will revoke Article 50. Almost impossible politically (it may well be a smart negotiating tactic, but come on) and the option of another extension is easier.\n5. The UK's Article 50 period will be extended beyond 31 October 2019. I think this is one of the two big options. I would say this would be more likely if the Government collapsed, as the EU does not want to have to suffer a no deal. It is also the option that might be announced ahead of a general election if you were concerned about financial stability, or if the EU agreed to further talks under different red lines (allowing free movement of people for instance)\n6. I think this is from the British side the most politically likely option. The parliamentary arithmetic can't change without one, the tories could strike a deal with the brexit party as to not lose too many votes. The result would likely be a coalition but I think the likely PM will see this as the only alternative, to 'gain a new mandate' / provide a reason for a further extension of Brexit.\n7. This solves nothing for any party involved, and the debates as to what the question will be, funding etc would take this past the time limit. I do not think it is a serious option and I do not think the consequences have been thought though, *especially* by those proposing it on the remain side who assumes that the only reason they lost in 2016 was because voters were 'not informed' about the risks, not accepting that people weight risk differently. My big assumption is that the EU likes to kick the can down the road and the UK not leaving benefits them, and I think this is a fairly safe comparison. But the main factor here is timing, there is very little time for any of the more complicated proposed situations above to happen.

Considering that one of the strong reasons for voting in the UK EU Referendum to Leave the EU was because the UK was culturally different to the rest of Europe, its interesting that the EU Parliamentary Elections appear to show that UK voters changes in political views since the last EU election are almost exactly the same as the EU average change in voting. The centre right and centre left lost votes, the Liberal Democrats and Greens gained votes as did the more extreme Nationalist. As far as this question is concerned I don't detect any signs that the EU's views on a Brexit agreement will be substantially different to the views of the old EU Parliament. So I don't anticipate the EU changing its views on the Irish Backstop before November 2019.  As far as the UK is concerned the big change since I last looked at this forecast is that Mrs May has resigned as Leader of the Conservative Party (but is still PM). It is assumed that once the Conservative Party has chosen a new party leader that person will become PM. It is generally being assumed that this is automatic, but it is perhaps less automatic than it appears. The new Conservative Party Leader will need to show that they \"have the confidence of the house\". This means a majority in Parliament. Currently the Conservative only have 313 voting MPs, a majority needs 322 MPs (650 - 7 non-sitting MPs - the speaker = 642 / 2 = 321 +1 = 322). As the leader of the largest party the Queen would (presumably) invite the new Conservative leader to try and form a government, but without the \"confidence of the house\" he (all men in the contest) would not (I believe) be PM. Several Conservative MPs have suggested they might quit the party if a new leader says he will aim to leave the EU with No Deal. In all probability they would not quit until nearer November (if at all) but the Conservatives would still need to get the support from at least 9 other MPs to have a majority. It is assumed that the DUP could be persuaded to continue with the current support arrangement they have with Mrs May's government, but I am sure they will have a price.  And if a couple more Conservative quit even the DUPs 10 MPs would not be enough. This could well delay the formation of a new government and the appointment of a new PM. Obviously much of this forecast depends on what the next PM does. The UK local elections and the EU parliamentary elections have shown that both the Conservative Party and Labour Party would risk losing a lot of seats in a UK Parliamentary Election. Its very difficult to predict what the outcome would be but the Conservatives would almost certainly loose most seats, but no party is likely to have an overall majority. So it seems likely that a new PM would prefer any other outcome than a General Election.   While several Conservative candidates for PM have said they would actively aim for a No Deal Brexit, those whom their fellow MPs considers crazy enough to mean it have been knocked out of the running, while those whom their fellow  MPs assume are just trying to sound as if they are crazy enough to mean it, but would not actually go ahead with No Deal have been forced to make clear that this would be the last resort. The majority of MPs (from all parties, but mostly Conservatives) seem to have the delusion that you need to threaten No Deal in order to win negotiations (No Deal is of course a reasonable position if it means maintaining the status quo, but its a crazy position if No Deal puts you in a much worse place than the status quo, when the status quo is on offer. Maybe the education system needs to be looked at if MPs don't understand this point.) So I think leaving without a deal will not happen. Conservative MPs would resign, Attempts to prevent MPs voting to stop a No Deal would probably destroy both the Conservative Party and the UK's constitution.    So can a new PM do a Brexit Deal with the EU before November? I suppose a new PM might have slightly more chance than Mrs May did, but the problems remain the same. MPs have got it into their minds that they will not vote for the deal agreed in November 2018 mainly because they don't like the Irish Backstop. So is it likely that the EU will agree to change or remove the Irish Backstop before November? This seems very unlikely especially as the EU's current Commissioners have agreed their position with EU Governments and the outgoing EU Parliament and have stuck to their line for many months (the principals were agreed in 2017). The current time table would suggest that between now and November there are only about 60 business days at most. It seems very unlikely that the EU would fold days before the new Commissioners took over. So I don't see this happening. The only way I can see to get a deal agreed before November would be for a new PM to convince MPs that he had changed Mrs May's deal in some way, but for the deal to in fact be exactly the same as the WA that has been agreed by the EU and rejected by Parliament three times. A great leader might be able to pull it off, but I don't see anyone of that caliber running for PM So the most likely thing to happen is as the end of October comes and no Brexit progress has been made the question of extending A50 again comes up. The EU will want to know why the UK wants to extend A50. To hold a General Election will not happen. I suppose the UK could claim that they could do a deal with the new EU Commission that will start in November. A new PM would surely not want to agree to another referendum, but it might be the only option they have to find a way out of Brexit. But this would only be a way out if the option on the referendum was the November 2018 WA or Remain in the EU. (any other answer would just repeat the same loop again.) But that would surely be a better way out than No Deal or Parliament Revoking A50 without the cover of another referendum.  But another referendum would require an extension of  six months. \nMy feeling is that the EU would prefer a extension of 6 months for another referendum rather than No Deal or forcing the UK to Revoke A50 as the only option to avoid No Deal.

General elections are  unlikely would be result of a split of the conservative, 7 conservatives would need vote no-confidence in their own government. Given the precedent of  \"Change Britain\" this means that 7 MPs would essentially choose to give up their seats. This is not impossible, but I expect that potential conservative rebels (such as D. Grieve or Hammond)  will explore every possible alternative before voting no confidence in a conservative government, and I expect that the next PM will also try to avoid to put them in such situation. ......Probability =5%         I don't see the EU offering a new deal or even being open to negotiating one. They would jeopardize their credibility, open the door to very difficult subsequent negotiations with the UK and in addition France's Macron would likely veto it.

On the plus side: this is the default option and the new conservative PM position will likely be \"no deal is better than a bad deal\" (not unlike the previous PM). However, there are two issues: 1/ it is easier to say \"no deal is better than a bad deal\" from the back benches than in downing street, where one will face the consequences of no deal. 2/ The arithmetic of Westminster has not changed. With current speaker John Bercow (remainer) indicating that he intends to remain in his seat this option will be difficult. Proba: 20%  The least unacceptable options are to extend one more time or call a referendum. This would occur after taking \"negotiations\" with the EU to the brink no-deal exit and possibly Parliament finding a legal way to force the government  to avoid \"no-deal\" brexit.   Between the two solution a referendum is more likely, as extending one more time would put the next PM once more in an humiliating position vis a vis the EU (worse than Theresa May) and bolster the Brexit party ratings at the expenses of the conservatives.

The EU elections results indicate that the country is more split on Brexit than one might have thought before, which will likely drive MPs apart as well. This will make it more difficult to pass a new WA. A referendum or a GE offers a way to resolve the differences in Parliament. Tories will want to avoid a GE as the last UK election and the EU election didn\u2019t work out well for them. They will want to avoid a scenario where Labour pushes for a GE and thus be more willing to go along with a referendum. To watch/resolve:\n* Who will be the new Tory leader? This is particularly important for the odds of a no-deal exit.\n* Will Tories be able to get a new WA in time and elicit enough votes for it without most of Labour (who seem in support of a referendum)?\n* What would the EU prefer to avoid? A no-deal exit or concessions needed for a new WA (e.g. the Irish backstop).

It's a messy situation so I started from the bottom up: I see no real prospect of the original WA passing. This should probably be 3% or something but I've simplified. I am likewise very very unconvinced a different deal can be agreed given the indicative votes were so split. If a new PM proposed a Single Market Brexit or similar it could probably pass the Commons and EU Parliament, but I see very little prospect of a Tory PM doing so (or Corbyn, for that matter). I really don't think there will be a snap election as the Tories voting for it are a necessary component of holding one and they think they'd be destroyed. Even if they might be willing to risk it, Tory MPs fear Corbyn becoming PM far more than a normal Labour leader. I think that makes them even more risk averse for holding an election.

These are my views:\n1. Leave with existing WA implies that May gets her the deal through parliament on her fourth try (at a moment where she seems weak and after European elections that will likely end disastrously for her party). I think the option is therefore unlikely. A new PM is also unlikely to try what May has failed at several times, but I guess it is still possible for May to reach a cross-party agreement that falls within the frame of the current WA. 2. Leave with a new WA before 1 November implies a renegotiation (be it in part) of the agreement with EU and have it pass parliament in 5.5 months. With the elections, summer recess and a likely change of the PM, all falling in that period, it seems improbable. I think it is possible with a new PM and maybe some shifting of red lines or if the government and Labour reach an agreement. 3. Leaving without a deal. I do not see why the government (or a majority in parliament) would do that, but sometimes ... 4. Revoking, Article 50. The government's position is to deliver Brexit. I can only imagine the government revoking Article 50 before November 1, in some crisis. 5. I think more time is needed and extending beyond 31 October is the most likely option at the moment. If no cross-party agreement can be reached with labour, a solution will take time. The current paths to Brexit create problems and risks that the EU expects the UK to resolve. At the moment, there is little incentive for the EU to change the status quo (they have already offered a longer extension before and will most probably do it again). Within the UK, blocks are very divided, and the government is unable to unite and solve the issues. There is no easy solution out of this situation.  6. I am not sure how the decision to hold a General Election would come about. As the government is somewhat unpopular, there is not much incentive to call for general elections. Should more significant numbers of conservative members start moving to other parties, a general election might happen.\n\n7. As the situation drags on and the situation does not resolve itself, another referendum might be called before November 1. Politically it might make sense (it is a \"democratic\" solution), But: 1. The government will have to decide on the referendum question (To be fair, the referendum would need one remain option and more leave options, watering down the leave vote). 2. The last referendum caused a situation that was very difficult for the government to deal with (they are weary). 3.

If circumstances arose that made No Deal the default I believe MPs would block it by forcing the Government to Revoke A50.  \nMPs would only Revoke A50 if the choice was that or No Deal. There would be a huge complaint from 35% or so of the pubic if A50 was revoked without some very good reason. In spite of the Government being unable to govern and the official opposition saying they want a general election both main parties will avoid risking it after the bad results for both Conservatives and Labour in last week's local elections. Projections of the result of a General Election suggest no party would get a majority, and neither Conservatives or Labour would find it easy to find  coalition partners (the LibDems will not be offering any help as being in coalition with the Conservatives nearly wiped out the LibDems in the last election).  The remaining options are more difficult. \nThere is not much chance of a referendum on Brexit unless it is a referendum on a specific form of Brexit. For there to be a  specific form of Brexit agreed to by the EU and the UK Parliament any referendum would not be based on a unicorn wish list (as was the 2016 referendum) and so be pointless because no one would know if what they were voting for was a deal that even existed. Even if the idea of having a referendum was agreed by parliament a date could not be set until legislation had been passed. If the referendum question included the option of accepting a Brexit proposal or Remaining in the EU, it would make no sense to hold the referendum (let alone set the date for the referendum) after the UK had already left the UK. So if a referendum does take place it has to be before leaving the EU.  It would take at least 22 weeks to arrange a referendum. To hold a referendum before 1st November would need parliament to agree to it almost immediately because several weeks after a referendum had taken place would (assuming the result was to Leave the EU) still require legislation to take place, so its almost certain that if a referendum was to be held the EU would need to first agree another extension to A50. Therefore before the date for a referendum could be set an extension to A50 would need to be agreed (but the question here is not will an extension be agreed, but will it actually take place first.)\nLabour has adopted the rather odd position that any deal that they don't back should include another referendum, but any deal they do back does not. Clearly if the government could get a deal through parliament that Labour did not back it would be able to ignore Labour's idea of a referendum on it. So on Labour's current plan they would never back a referendum on a deal they liked and would be unable to get a referendum on a deal that the government could pass without Labour's support. So I don't expect the Labour leadership to be able to stick to this line.\n  There is probably little chance of extending A50 unless it is to hold a referendum and a date would need to be arranged for that before 1st Nov. Therefore there is little chance of reaching 1st Nov without one of other of the other options being reached first.  The WA agreed in Nov 18 could get agreed by parliament, but does not look probable. Its been rejected three times so for it to be agreed would require either the hard line ERG faction of Conservative to back it alone with some MPs from opposition parties to back it or a lot of opposition MPs to back it.  It is possible that some more ERG Conservatives will cave in and back the Nov 18 deal, but it seems very unlikely they will all cave in. What difference will the local elections last week and the EU elections in three weeks make? What we do know is that voters are unhappy with both the Conservative and Labour parties. What is less clear is why they unhappy. Presumably some are unhappy because they want the UK to Leave with no deal, some are unhappy because they want to Leave the EU with a deal, and some are unhappy because they don't want to Leave the EU at all. It is thought that about 75% of Conservative voters wanted to Leave the EU, so presumably 25% of Conservative voters are unhappy because the Conservative are no listening to them and that they are unlikely to  continue voting Conservative. Of the 75% of Conservatives who it is thought support Brexit the opinion polls suggest that most of them would prefer a No Deal Brexit to the Nov 18 deal, so there would seem to be little electoral benefit to the Conservatives in forcing the Nov 18 deal though parliament when 75% or 80% of there voters don't like it. \nOf the opposition parties in parliament the DUP supports Brexit, but is very firm in its opposition to the Nov 18 deal so they are very unlikely to change their minds and back it. The LibDems, the SNP/PC and Greens are all firmly for Remain, so are very unlikely to change their minds and back the Nov 18 deal.\nThat leaves the Labour Party. It is estimated 75% of Labour voters are not in favour of Brexit. The leader of the party is less clear. Most constituencies that are held by Labour voted Leave in the referendum, but of course many or most who voted for Leave might not have also voted Labour (presumably in constituencies won by Labour MPs there are lots of voters who voted Leave in the referendum but vote for the the Conservatives or UKIP in most elections). Most Labour MPs supported Remain. So for Labour MPs to change to support the Nov 18 deal they would have to vote against their own judgement and vote against the views of the majority of Labour voters in the hope that they don't lose more votes than they lose. And take the not inconsiderable risk that those constituents who did indeed vote to Leave probably hate the Nov 18 Conservative Brexit deal. I it were me I would not go down route because its is almost certain to lose votes.     Finally there is the possibility of a re-negociated withdrawl deal. Its possible in theory but presumably would only happen if Mrs May resigned and there was a new PM. The EU would not want to re-open negotiations, and although 1st Nov seems a long way ahead between now and then we have the EU Parliamentary Elections (May) no sitting EU Parliament (June),, the summer holidays (August), agreeing the new EU Commission (September/October?). There does seem much time for the EU spend on negotiations.  (I assume changing the Political Statement that goes with the Withdrawal Agreement does not count as re-negotiations.) So the bottom line is that Brexit is a mess with no way forward if everyone sticks to what they are currently saying. The least damaging way out would be for the Conservastives after a change of PM has taken place to agree another referendum. Then the public can be blamed for whatever the outcome is.

Revokation seems very unlikely as May\u2019s government has repeatedly ruled it out (unless another PM is in place) No deal has been voted on and shown to be very unpopular in Parliament. Same with the existing WA. The other three options appear almost equally likely to me for now. Lack of confidence in May suggests the possibility for a GE. A GE has been suggested before and would resolve the gridlock.  A referendum would help resolve the current grid-lock too and may be preferable to Conservatives (who lost in the last election) so I am considering that slightly more likely. Renegotiating with the EU appears unlikely as Tusk and others have stood firmly behind the existing agreement. Though they may be willing to avoid a no-deal.
