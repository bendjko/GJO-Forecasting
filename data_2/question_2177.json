In 2021, the US evidently built Level 2 and DC Fast charging stations at the rate of 57.8 per day, up from 21 per day in 2020 and 10 per day in 2019. So let's stake out a few markers here: - If construction proceeds at the same rate as in 2021, we're looking at 6800 new chargers, which puts us right at the 53,000 line.\n- If construction rates double, as they've roughly been doing, we're looking at 13,600 new chargers, which puts us at the 60,000 line.\n- If construction rates MORE than double, as they've been doing a bit more precisely for the past two years, then we're in 61k+ territory. So all in all, at least initially, I'm not disposed to put much credence in either of the lowest two buckets. But thanks to @Ryan-Beck, we know that spikes in the historical data indicate re-categorizations of existing chargers, not necessarily actual installations, so perhaps I mean \"construction\" not construction. Our 2021 rate looks a lot more like our 2020 rate if we take the January 2021 chargers out of the equation. If chargers open at that rate, then we're at just about 49,000, so perhaps I should give that some more credence. Here's some more information - the dataset is up-to-date for today, the first day of the year, with twelve chargers evidently already in place. Hm. In December 2021, we have 1072 opening. In November we have 800. In October, ~2000! The monthly rate barely dropped below 600 in 2021, and didn't rise above 2000. I think that should be out 95% CI to start with. That puts us between 48500 at the low end and 54,000 at the high end. I think that's a big update for me. I'll take a step back and think of this just as a Poisson process with a mean of 1000, e.g. a slightly bumped-up mean for 2021 from February to December.

It sounds like the big jump was because two companies or data sources were added which added more stations and broke existing ones out into multiples. So it seems less likely to me that we see another sudden big jump. \"As you noted, there is a jump in EV charging station counts starting in February 2021 because the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is transitioning EV charging counting logic to align with the hierarchy defined in the Open Charge Point Interface (OCPI; https://evroaming.org/ocpi-background/) protocol: stations, electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) ports, and connectors. With this transition, the number of charging outlets in the Stations Locator is being updated to represent the number of EVSE ports (or number of vehicles that can charge simultaneously) at a station location, rather than the number of connectors previously counted. The Station Locator still identifies the available connector types.  NREL imports networked EV charging data, including Blink, ChargePoint, Electrify America, EVgo, FLO, Greenlots, SemaConnect, OpConnect and Webasto, via each network\u2019s application programming interface (API). Most networks have adopted the OCPI protocol to support roaming agreements with other networks, and to date, NREL has integrated Electrify America, EVgo, Greenlots, and ChargePoint\u2019s OCPI-based APIs. Additionally, all non-networked charging data in the Station Locator follow the OCPI protocol.  Greenlots and ChargePoint\u2019s OCPI APIs were integrated last in January 2021. This resulted in jumps in station counts because of the way that station data were shared under the protocol: in many cases, one station split out into several new stations to represent different physical locations of EVSE ports at one address. While the new stations shared the same street address, they have different coordinates. Additionally, jumps in station counts were attributed to new installations being added via the APIs.

That's pretty huge and well above trend, and we're also looking at a 6 month period. So for my low end estimate I'll assume an increase of a quarter of that in 6 months, which would get us to 48.3k stations. For the high end I'll assume the same increase of about 13.2k, so about 58.2k. The average of those two numbers is about 53.3k.

I will approximate no more than 4,000 will be able to be installed based on these limits. Hertz also announced it would be installing chargers in 65 cities concurrent with its recent 100,000 vehicle deal with Tesla. Unfortunately the details of number of chargers per city is difficult to determine therefore it is difficult to estimate the whole number of chargers to be installed.

Tabulation of # new stations/month for Feb-Oct 2021 is given here: [602 553 833 803 668 744 794 1446 1853]. Why list just Feb-Oct? Well, January 2021 apparently had 11,171 new records in just that month (~1/4 of all stations ever)... so it seems that our data set of active charging stations may not have been \"smoothly\" entered in sync with the actual timing of new charging stations coming online. As others may have noticed too, there are a few specific dates (\"Open Date\" attribute in the table) that have a very disproportionately large number of records associated with them, e.g., 1/27/2021, 10/25/2021, etc. This suggests that the data entry methodology probably involves some \"catch-up\" periods where large pulses of backlogged records are suddenly added to the data set, far beyond the \"normal\" background accumulation rate of new station entries. This aspect of our data will presumably make prediction of the number of stations on 29 April 2022 a bit more \"interesting\", since at any point between now and April there could suddenly be, say, 10k new stations added from one month to the next. I recognize that I've casually assumed that such a high pulse of entries concentrated in a single day will reflect simple backlogs in data entry being addressed, but perhaps someone has an idea for how else these pulses might arise? (And how they might even be predictable?) For now, my forecast will assume that the recent months' station count data (as given above) will be typical going forward, so that the average monthly rate of new station adds over the question timeframe will be between 500/month and 1800/month, including maybe some additional \"backlog-spikes\". How to more optimally weight the various possible monthly growth rates that can be inferred from the data (noteworthy that September/October rates are much higher than the other months, but also include possible backlog-days!) will be very interesting to think about, as well as how to best account for the possibility of future \"shocks\" to the growth trends.
