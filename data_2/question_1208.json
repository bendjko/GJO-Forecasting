The last assessment concluded that the national and regional risk levels remain very high, while global risk levels remain low. While the relatively lower case incidence observed is encouraging, it must be interpreted with caution as the situation remains highly contingent upon the level of access and security within affected communities. Concurrent with the decline in case incidence, there was a shift in hotspots from urban settings to more rural, hard-to-reach communities, within a more concentrated geographical area. These areas bring additional challenges to the response, including an extremely volatile security situation, difficulty accessing some remote areas, delays to engaging with the community which in turn lead to mistrust and misunderstandings, and potential under-reporting of cases. The recent security events and disruption of response activities underscore the fact that the risk of resurgence remains very high, as do the risks of re-dispersion of the outbreak with cases travelling outside of hotspots to seek healthcare or for other reasons.

Faced with a lethal Ebola outbreak threatening eastern Africa, public health officials are conceding that their battle plan is failing and have proposed a comprehensive new strategy for containing the virus. It envisions reframing the epidemic as a regional humanitarian crisis, not simply a health emergency. That may include more troops or police to quell the murders and arson that have made medical work difficult, as well as food aid to win over skeptical locals. The Democratic Republic of Congo also plans to deploy a second vaccine to form a protective \u201ccurtain\u201d of immunity around outbreak areas. The outbreak . . .  has persisted in part because of a fierce but hidden power struggle within Congo\u2019s government for control of the response, according to documents obtained by The New York Times and interviews with Ebola experts. Dr. Ilunga was the target of a scathing internal government report produced in April, just as new cases began soaring above 100 per week. The report was written by a commission convened by Congo\u2019s new president, some of whose members are now overseeing the response. The report said \u201carrogant\u201d national health officials took \u201can aggressive and ostentatious attitude\u201d when they visited the outbreak area, renting deluxe hotel rooms and expensive cars and \u201cbrandishing large dollar bills\u201d while local health workers went unpaid. A spokeswoman for Dr. Ilunga called the report \u201cweak.\u201d She said he had resigned not because of it, but because the president had split the authority to oversee the response between his office and an independent commission, which she claimed was a violation of the Congolese Constitution. Dr. Ilunga\u2019s departure pleased some donors and agencies supporting the fight against Ebola. The United States is by far the biggest donor. Tibor P. Nagy, the State Department\u2019s top official for African affairs, told a Senate subcommittee on Wednesday that Dr. Ilunga\u2019s resignation \u201cmay be an improvement to the situation.\u201d The country is seeking $288 million to implement its new Ebola strategy, and is likely to get it. The World Bank recently offered $300 million. The United States increased its previous giving by $38 million this week, and federal aid officials have said they are committed to containing the outbreak at its source. The new plan may include a campaign to win the hearts of the traumatized population in the isolated eastern provinces by immunizing them against other diseases, treating children for parasites, handing out food and even creating thousands of jobs. Experts hope efforts will be made to negotiate a truce with local militias. The health ministry\u2019s strategic plan for the period from July to December, written in cooperation with the W.H.O., has not been officially released but is circulating among the donors and health agencies, and a copy was obtained by The Times. While it envisions a much broader response, the plan is vague on specifics \u2014 omitting even references to which vaccines should be used. By contrast, the commission\u2019s report in April endorsed the second vaccine by name and called for many specific actions, like giving hot meals to malnourished children. Because its main authors are now leading the response, experts expect those steps will be taken. In May, the United Nations made a similar shift. David Gressly, the deputy head of the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Congo, was put in charge of coordinating U.N. humanitarian and political efforts so that the World Health Organization could focus on the health response. Even though the W.H.O. and many donors endorsed the new vaccine, made by Johnson & Johnson, in May, Dr. Ilunga vigorously opposed using it. He said it would confuse the populace and be difficult to administer, since it requires two doses given 56 days apart. To avoid confusion, it will be deployed differently from the current single-dose Merck vaccine. While that one is used to \u201cring-vaccinate\u201d everyone around each known case, the new vaccine will be used in areas further away to encircle the hot zones with immunized people. For example, while the Merck vaccine has been given to Ugandan health workers on the Congo border, the new one will be deployed in Mbarara, a regional capital 60 miles away with a big hospital that ill patients might travel to. Close to 200,000 doses of the Merck vaccine have been distributed. The company has plans to produce 800,000, but some experts fear shortages, especially if the virus escapes into South Sudan, which is as dysfunctional and war-torn as eastern Congo. Johnson & Johnson has offered 500,000 doses; the vaccine is easier to store and has been tested for safety on 6,000 human volunteers, but has not been deployed in the field. At its core, the political struggle within Congo pitted Dr. Ilunga, 59, who had been a minister since 2016, against Dr. Jean-Jacques Muyembe, director-general of the country\u2019s National Institute for Biomedical Research. It also was a struggle between President Tshisekedi and his predecessor, Joseph Kabila, 48. After 18 contentious years in office, Mr. Kabila stepped down last year and is now a senator for life. In December, Mr. Tshisekedi won a disputed election, beating Mr. Kabila\u2019s chosen successor. But since then, he has only slowly replaced Mr. Kabila\u2019s cabinet ministers. Dr. Ilunga, who visited the outbreak area several times, is respected by some Ebola experts. The head of one international agency, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid involvement in another country\u2019s dispute, called him \u201cprincipled and data-driven.\u201d Dr. Muyembe, 77, is an internationally respected authority on Ebola who has helped fight every outbreak since the virus was discovered in 1976, when the country was named Zaire. The report by the commission led by Dr. Muyembe accused Dr. Ilunga of \u201cweak governance, weak leadership and a hyper-centralized response\u201d that failed to coordinate with other ministries, including the police and army. In addition to accusing Dr. Ilunga and his staff of arrogance and ostentation, the report also cataloged serious medical failures. People with fevers who entered screening centers to see if they had Ebola did not get test results for three to five days, by which time they might become infected with Ebola \u2014 or infect others if they had it. Private clinics and traditional healers held patients in order to make money, Little was done to protect areas where the virus had not yet appeared or to coordinate with neighboring countries, the report said. And while the commission\u2019s field visits had gone \u201cgenerally well,\u201d its work was hampered because Dr. Ilunga had refused repeated requests to meet with members and his office had been uncooperative with information requests. Jessica Ilunga, a spokeswoman for the former health minister, derided the report and said it \u201chad no data\u201d \u2014 such as the names of health workers who claimed they had gone unpaid. She denied that national officials had spent too much money and scoffed at the idea that outbreak cities like Butembo even had luxury hotels. National officials had needed running water and internet connections to do their jobs, she said, while some had even slept in tents. The ministry did cooperate with neighboring countries, she said, pointing to efforts with Ugandan officials when the virus briefly crossed the border. In her view, the commission had failed to contact the ministry, even after being asked to explain what it was investigating. Also, she said, its members had met separately with outside agencies and had tried to countermand ministry orders to its front-line workers. In addition, she said, since he took office in January, Mr. Tshisekedi had refused to see Dr. Ilunga. The tense atmosphere was fostered by rivalry between the current president and the former one, said Dr. Peter Piot, director-general of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. But, added Dr. Piot, who is a discoverer of the Ebola virus and serves on W.H.O. advisory committees, there also appeared to be personal antagonism between the two doctors. In late spring, he said, when he and Dr. Muyembe went to Dr. Ilunga\u2019s office to discuss the second vaccine. Dr. Ilunga \u2014 \u201cappearing quite autocratic,\u201d he said \u2014 agreed to see him but refused to admit Dr. Muyembe. \u201cI thought, \u2018Oh, God. I didn\u2019t realize how bad the dynamics were.\u2019\u201d\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  The good news is that it seems that the efforts to contain, treat, and prevent ebola will improve and be increased.

First of them being, what kind of Ebola is this? It is the Zaire strain which (without the vaccine) is 90% deadly. The next thing to know is how Ebola is transferred from person to person, it can only be transferred via human liquid exchange with something like a kiss, an erotic hug, and greater. This matters because the countries bordering Rwanda are Uganda, and Rwanda.  The next thing to note is the location of some of the cases. And the last time I checked there was a case that was found in Uganda about a month ago between a 5 year old and a 50 year old [1]. The next thing to note, symptoms of Ebola have a dormant period between 2 and 21 days.  Initial Screening:\nWhen you are at the border, the initial symptoms are self reported by the travelers or they appear to present with Ebola, after filling in a survey at the border station.  If they do present with symptoms, then they have to go through a secondary screening which includes.  Secondary Screening:[2]\n-They have no known risk of EVD exposure as determined by the secondary screening interview;  \n-They do not appear to exhibit any of the signs or report any symptoms consistent with EVD as determined by the secondary screening interview; \n-AND  They do not have a fever of 38.6\u00b0 C or 101.5\u00b0 F or higher, as verified during the secondary screening  There is also an ongoing war in Ituri between the Hema and the Lendu. Which, by the way,  killed 140 people a couple of weeks ago, and displaced 300,000 people,  What Would It Take for This to Happen: \n-A driving force to push people to drive\n-A sufficient amount of people to go to the border\n-A high distrust for government officials in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\n-Cases popping up in cities near borders  So, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is a very large country. And since it takes a couple of days to drive across other countries, along with the incubation period, I would put the chances of a case appearing in the third part option to be a non-zero chance given the incubation period. I am going to upgrade a case popping up in Rwanda due to the high amount of traffic due to displacement. But for the third option. That means they have to travel through the entire country of Rwanda, and slip past all the security personal, without transferring it to someone in the country.  If you are dormant with symptoms, there is sufficient motivation to lie if you are fleeing from the country. The only reason I am going lower on the second option is because, Rwanda is small and prepared, South Sudan is much larger, and harder to navigate based on lack of infrastrure, genocide, that kind of thing. But is Rwanda small enough that you can travel the entire country in less than 21 days to Kenya to spread Ebola there? That is why I am going to upgrade that to 3%. And because of the high amount of traffic at the border with the war, I am going to downgrade the last option to 14%. Plus the cases are increasing, so I am going to upgrade option 1 to the 68% and I am going to downgrade the second option to 18% But it seems unlikely that it can be contained, so i am going to put no at 11%. The Trail of bodies needed for a case to be in Kenya is at 8% given the amount of preparedness and the WHO applauding Rwanda for being so prepared. With the amount of traffic, I am going to upgrade the first option to 78% [4]. https://www.africanews.com/2019/07/19/uganda-intensifies-surveillance-after-who-reports-new-ebola-incident/\nhttps://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/139691/WHO_EVD_Guidance_PoE_14.2_eng.pdf?sequence=1\nhttps://www.africanews.com/2019/07/19/uganda-intensifies-surveillance-after-who-reports-new-ebola-incident/\nhttps://reliefweb.int/report/rwanda/who-applauds-rwanda-s-ebola-preparedness-efforts\n"], [37435, "2019-07-25T17:19:21Z", [0.65, 0.2, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [77396, "2019-07-25T09:43:53Z", [0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.9], ""], [77395, "2019-07-25T08:02:46Z", [0.65, 0.15, 0.2, 0.0], ""], [77393, "2019-07-25T06:16:40Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.65, 0.25], ""], [77391, "2019-07-25T03:48:14Z", [0.8, 0.1, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [73813, "2019-07-25T03:47:56Z", [0.1, 0.7, 0.2, 0.0], ""], [77390, "2019-07-25T02:38:25Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [38, "2019-07-24T16:32:30Z", [0.55, 0.3, 0.11, 0.04], "http://news.trust.org/item/20190723212404-oepob/ Numerous media reports reveal that the people at the epicenter of the epidemic are in a panic due to conflicts between the Congolese Army and Islamist groups.

The WHO has warned that the nearby countries of Rwanda, South Sudan, Burundi and Uganda are the most at risk, while Central African Republic, Angola, Tanzania, Republic of Congo and Zambia are in a second tier."], [38, "2019-07-18T16:33:32Z", [0.5, 0.3, 0.16, 0.04], "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/health/ebola-outbreak.html?nl=todaysheadlines&emc=edit_th_190718?campaign_id=2&instance_id=10976&segment_id=15311&user_id=0a0c579776f0cfaf13a2bd3672253728&regi_id=286991830718 July 17, 2019 \"The year-old Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo is now considered a global health emergency, the World Health Organization said on Wednesday, in a formal declaration that many public health experts called long overdue. \". . . . the panel was persuaded by several factors that have made combating the epidemic more urgent in recent weeks: The disease reached Goma, a city of nearly two million people; the outbreak has raged for a year; the virus has flared again in spots where it had once been contained; and the epidemic hot zone has geographically expanded in northeastern Congo near Rwanda and into Uganda. Violence against health workers has been a constant worry, and intensified after two Congolese workers were killed in their homes in Beni last week. Officials are also dismayed by the persistence of the epidemic even with the extensive use of a successful vaccine. This was the fourth time that the W.H.O. had considered whether to declare a global health emergency in the Congo outbreak. It stopped short the first three times, even though some aid agencies and public health officials had called on the organization to do so in hopes such an order would elicit more funds and recruit more health workers to the region. But government officials have repeatedly expressed competing concerns about interrupting trade or restricting travel, which Dr. Steffen emphasized should not result from the emergency status issued on Wednesday. Emergency declarations are issued sparingly, reserved for outbreaks that pose a serious threat to public health and could spread to other countries. Only four such declarations have been made in the past: in 2009, for pandemic influenza; in 2014, for a polio resurgence in several countries; in 2014, for the Ebola epidemic in West Africa; and in 2016, for the Zika virus epidemic. Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the W.H.O., has described this outbreak as one of the world\u2019s most dangerous viruses in one of the world\u2019s most dangerous areas. Public health experts warn that the implacable spread of the virus means the outbreak could easily continue well into next year. It is the second largest Ebola outbreak in history after the one in West Africa in 2014-15, which infected 28,616 people and caused 11,310 deaths. Earlier Ebola Outbreaks, and How the World Overcame Them\nHemorrhagic fever inspires almost mythic terror, but whether it can be beaten depends more on people than on medical advances.\nJuly 17, 2019 The decision on Wednesday was based on a vote by 11 members of an expert panel convened by Dr. Tedros to reassess the current outbreak after an infected man carried the virus to the city of Goma, a densely populated transportation hub close to Rwanda that has an international airport. That patient has died.\n. . . \nRebecca Katz, director of the Center for Global Health Science and Security at Georgetown University, said in a statement: \u201cAlmost all international legal and policy experts agree that the conditions for declaring a public health emergency of international concern were met long ago, so we are delighted to see that the emergency committee and the director-general have finally come to this decision. Not only do we believe that the decision will help bring additional needed attention to this ongoing crisis, but also move nations in the regions to take all necessary steps to address the potential spread of the disease.\u201d The executive director of Unicef, Henrietta Fore, said in a statement: \u201cThis is an emergency. There is a very real risk that the Ebola outbreak could spread to neighboring countries, so the international community should urgently come together to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d . . . At a United Nations meeting about the outbreak on Monday, one official said he had seen syringes and gloves being reused because equipment was becoming scarce.\n. . . \nMore than 161,000 people have received an Ebola vaccine made by Merck that is considered highly effective. Concerns about the supply have led the W.HO. to recommend using smaller doses to keep from running out.\n. . . \nThe W.H.O. and other experts have advocated the use of a second vaccine as well, made by Johnson & Johnson. But Congo\u2019s Ministry of Health has declined it, saying that the Merck vaccine is known to work, and that it is the only one the nation\u2019s citizens, after a period of mistrust and suspicion, have come to accept. Dr. Michael Ryan, the executive director for W.H.O.\u2019s health emergencies program, said, \u201cW.H.O. still supports the introduction of a second vaccine.\u201d He added that the agency was discussing it with officials in Congo. The man who brought the disease to Goma was a pastor who had preached in seven churches in the epidemic zone, laying hands on the sick. He became ill and was treated by a nurse, but got on a bus to Goma anyway. The bus stopped at three checkpoints meant to halt the spread of the disease by screening passengers for symptoms, but his illness was not detected. He gave a different name at each checkpoint, apparently hoping to avoid being detained, local health authorities said. Sick and feverish by the time he arrived in Goma, he went to a clinic there, where the disease was diagnosed. He was the only patient in the Goma clinic, which was disinfected after his visit. Health authorities have been tracking the 18 other bus passengers and the driver, as well as others who might have been exposed to the disease by the pastor, and providing vaccinations. So far, 257 people \u2014 contacts of the pastor, and their contacts \u2014 have been vaccinated.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  The significance of the case in Goma is that Goma has a population of about 2 million, is only 45 km from the border, and has an international airport."], [76230, "2019-07-18T15:09:53Z", [0.3, 0.15, 0.55, 0.0], ""], [76607, "2019-07-18T14:58:37Z", [0.28, 0.28, 0.28, 0.16], ""], [76606, "2019-07-18T14:55:07Z", [0.99, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01], ""], [76602, "2019-07-18T14:37:17Z", [0.05, 0.01, 0.1, 0.84], ""], [76299, "2019-07-18T14:01:12Z", [0.55, 0.25, 0.15, 0.05], ""], [76595, "2019-07-18T13:52:56Z", [0.15, 0.2, 0.65, 0.0], ""], [76570, "2019-07-18T13:50:13Z", [0.3, 0.1, 0.6, 0.0], "Very aware how difficult to control as there may be carriers without it affecting them"], [76440, "2019-07-18T13:40:58Z", [0.15, 0.02, 0.03, 0.8], "Ebola is not moving far but as cases increase likely of air travel transmission increases.

At a biological level, the two outbreaks are identical. . .  However, there have been positive developments: New drugs are being studied in organized trials in the current outbreak. And perhaps the most important factor of all is that a safe and effective vaccine has been deployed. A preliminary analysis of the vaccine in DRC indicates it has been more than 97 percent effective. These results strongly suggest the Ebola vaccine has saved hundreds, if not thousands, of lives. These factors, along with an organized international response implemented more quickly than in the West African outbreak of 2014\u201315, have resulted in a smaller number of cases, and, until recently, prevented international spread. But other circumstances have hindered efforts to contain the virus, and these have led, I believe, to the outbreak spreading into Uganda. Unlike Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea\u2014the three principal countries of the West African outbreak\u2014the North Kivu and Ituri provinces of the DRC have been a war zone effectively for the past generation. The Kivu conflict alone includes armed groups representing the interests of multiple regional and European states. The fighting has led to millions of displaced people. To a great extent, an area the size of Alabama has spent more than 20 years in a state of lawlessness. This instability, combined with the ongoing military conflict in the DRC, is an ideal environment for Ebola. As with many outbreaks, the misery of a given infection is defined as much by the structural inequalities brought on by war and poverty as it is by a microbe's biological characteristics. International aid workers have been attacked by hostile groups, forcing medical groups to close down treatment units and curtail their vaccination programs. The consequence has been a rise in new infections, which may lead to a feedback loop in which more people become harder to treat, causing more infections in turn. According to reports, militia groups are very likely involved in these attacks, but locals may also be involved, motivated by suspicion and fear. This happened at the height of the West African outbreak, when villagers attacked a group of health professionals trying to teach Ebola prevention techniques in rural Guinea, killing eight. The good news is that attitudes toward the Ebola vaccine appear to be positive in the affected areas. The bad news is that there remains a significant percentage, maybe as high as 20 percent of people, who profoundly distrust the government, often because the government has acted as a \"battlefield enemy.\" Further, a recent New England Journal of Medicine commentary by a doctor working in the region suggested that people who live in DRC are often skeptical of the intentions of international aid organizations who set up Ebola treatment units, yet seem to be unconcerned with tuberculosis and malaria, which are major and longstanding scourges in Africa. All these factors may cause families to \"hide\" Ebola cases from contact tracers, leading to further spread. Thus, the vaccine keeps the current outbreak partially in check, while instability prevents its eradication. By contrast, the West African outbreak of 2014\u201315 rose with such unprecedented speed that it dominated world headlines for nearly four months between August and October of 2014. The alarm it generated led to the international response that helped contain it; today's DRC outbreak has not resulted in the same alarm. The longer Ebola persists in the DRC, the more likely an improbable event will occur\u2014like the spread of the virus beyond the borders of the DRC, or perhaps much further beyond its borders. The spread into Uganda may simply be a warning sign. There is little cause for optimism that the epidemic will end anytime soon.\n, , , , \nThis article was originally published on The Conversation.
