Coronavirus may now be scarier to swing voters in higher risk groups who may NOT have been overly concerned about COVID before but at least acknowledge it now. Those voters who had planned to turn out, may end up being more afraid of coronavirus, than they are of the prospect of a republican senate. They just may not be motivated enough, and they are probably more likely to believe that COVID is a thing and something, now, they should be concerned about getting. \n2. Conversely the actions of the president and others have further mobilized, not only the base, but also the far right contingent(s) of republican voters, many of whom are motivated to \"save America\" and they generally tend to be less concerned about transmitting and/or contracting the coronavirus. \n3. Current polls which vary wildly, could just be so skewed Democrat (access to and use of technology is NOT as ubiquitous as we all think, even though it very nearly is, there are some glaring blind spots, and there could be an influx of rural voters, predominantly republican, who haven't been an active part of the conversation, except for the signs, and other Trump flags they are flying on the country highways everywhere.  I just think it will be a numbers game that every little bit will hurt the democrat and help the republican.
