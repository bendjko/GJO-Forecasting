In order to reach the AED 68.9bn target, they would need to grow revenue by over 115% in H2. Unfortunately, international travel has continued to stagnate in the latter part of 2021. A recent report by the UN's ICAO (prepared December 2021) presented five different forecasts for total international passenger volumes in each month of 2022 (page 39 below). Across those five scenarios, total international passenger volume between October 2021 and March 2022 (which corresponds to Emirates H2) was between 35% and 50% larger than total internal passenger volume between April 2021 and September 2021 (which corresponds to Emirates H1). 35-50% passenger growth is well below the 115%+ growth Emirates needs to reach the AED 68.9bn target. Consequently, there's little chance of this happening. 1. Emirates H1 2020-21 Results: https://gulfbusiness.com/dubais-emirates-group-reports-1-6bn-half-year-net-loss/\n2. ICAO Report: https://www.icao.int/sustainability/Documents/Covid-19/ICAO_coronavirus_Econ_Impact.pdf --- Update ---\nI've been trying to think of some other factors that could lead Emirates to reach the threshold, but it still seems very unlikely to me, unless I'm missing something.\nA. Revenue per Passenger: Even if growth in total number of passengers is modest, Emirates could boost revenue further by increasing their revenue per passenger. According to Emirates' 2020-21 annual report, passenger yields (revenue / revenue passenger kilometer) did increase by around 3% from 2019-20 to 2020-21, so one could argue that similar growth might be achievable in 2021-22. But this seems unlikely given the trend in yields so far this year. While the press release about Emirates H1 2021-22 results doesn't mention what Emirates' yields were in H1, comparable firms like Lufthansa actually saw a -1.2% decline in yields in Q1-Q3 2021 relative to Q1-Q3 2020. Intuitively, this sounds right to me given that business travel generates higher revenue per traveler than tourist travel and it's been widely reported that the business travel segment has recovered much more slowly than the tourist travel segment and may not fully recover until 2024 or later (bloomberg article below). Therefore, it seems like yields are more likely to decline than rise for Emirates in H2 2021-22, and even if yields do increase, they'll very likely increase by less than 5% which only boosts the estimated growth range above from 35-50% to ~40-60%.\nB. Geographic Mix: One could argue that Emirates may experience higher growth than the overall international market if it has greater exposure to geographic markets that are expected to see above-average growth. The ICAO report above actually provides region-based forecasts of both international passenger volume and international airline revenue for Africa, Asia Pacific, Europe, Latin America, North America, and Middle East. If you weight their forecasted revenue by Emirates revenue composition in 2020-21, you get a growth range for H2 relative to H1 between 47-68%, which is higher than the overall market but still well less than the 115%+ growth Emirates needs to reach the target .\nC. Peer Firms: Emirates does not provide any guidance for H2 that I have been able to find, but some of its peers do. Lufthansa is one peer that does provide guidance on expected passengers in Q4 2021 and Q1 2022. Like Emirates, Lufthansa is a large established airline with a diverse geographic base. There are, however, some differences in geographic revenue composition. For example, Emirates is more exposed to Asia Pacific (28% vs. 19% for Lufthansa) and ME + Africa (20% vs. 8%) and less exposed to Europe (26% vs. 38%) and Americas (14% vs. 34%). But it still seems close enough to be worth using Lufthansa as a sense check / benchmark. On page 21 of their Q3 presentation, Lufthansa gives some guidance on expected passengers for Q4 2021 and Q1 2022 relative to 2019 for tourist vs. business segments. We don't know what share each segment is of Emirates' or Lufthansa's revenue, but the bloomberg news article suggests the business segment could account for 30% of passengers and 60% or more of revenue in non-pandemic years. Given business travel has suffered worse recently, assume that revenue is now split 50-50 between the two segments. Lufthansa' passengers were around 18% of 2019 levels (page 28 of Q2 presentation) in Q2 2021 and 46% of 2019 levels (page 28 of Q3 presentation) in Q3 2021. Management now forecasts (page 21) that they'll be 51% (avg. of 40% and 62.5%) of those levels in Q4 2021 and 59% (average of 45% and 72.5%) of those levels in Q1 2022. That would suggest that passenger volumes in Q4 2021 + Q1 2022 (51% + 59%) (which corresponds to Emirates H2) are expected to be 70-75% higher than passenger volumes in Q2 2021 + Q3 2021 (18% + 46%) (which corresponds to Emirates H1). 70-75% is on the high range of the estimate in point B, but it's still well less than the 115%+ growth they need to reach the threshold.\nD. Non-Passenger Revenue: One could argue that Emirates might be able to generate greater revenue through non-passenger revenue. They were in fact able to do this in 2020-21 when they increased cargo revenue by ~50% and they mentioned in their H1 2021-22 press release that cargo revenue \"continued to perform strongly\". But in a usual year, 80-85% of Emirates revenue comes from passengers and another ~5% comes from sales of goods and hotel operations that are likely to be correlated with passenger volumes. Therefore, in order to reach the threshold, it seems pretty clear that passenger revenue is going to need to generate an overwhelming share of the growth.\nE. Seasonality: In a normal non-pandemic year, Emirates' full year revenue is typically split 50-50 between H1 and H2; there don't appear to be any strong seasonal effects. Therefore, the 115%+ growth they need to generate in H2 is going to have to be driven entirely by reopenings and changes in macro conditions that lead to more travel.\nF. Market Share Changes: It's always possible that Emirates could find a way to grow faster than individual peers and the overall markets by gaining market share. But at this point they are a pretty large, mature company and so it seems unlikely to me that dramatic market share changes are likely to occur at this stage of the company's lifecycle.\nG. Tail Events: I can think of tail events that would lead to a dramatic and sudden decline in airline revenue in the next three months (new Covid variants, military conflicts, terrorist attacks) but it's a lot harder to think of tail events that would lead to dramatic and sudden uptick in airline revenue. It could be something like China unexpectedly abandoning it's no-covid policy earlier. An unexpected acquisition could be another way to boost revenue dramatically, but that can't be feasibly accomplished before the question deadline. Sources.\n3.

So if we assume an average of 23B in revenue per quarter, the end of H1 has returned ~47% pre-pandemic revenue.  If this grows linearly to 70% this quarter, then we have an average percentage of (70-47)/2 + 47 = 58.5% or Q3 = 13.5B. Using the same logic for Q4 to mid 2022, we can assume 85% of pre-pandemic revenue can be met by end of Q4, so (85-70)/2 + 70 = 77.5% or Q4 = 17.8B Which gives a H2 estimate of 31.3B leaving things about 16B short to resolve as yes.  Alternatively applying 70% of Q3 and 85% for Q4 only gets to 35.6B revenue for H2. Or seeing as we're not forecasting revenue, if the reporting of 21.7B is correct for H1, then they require pre-pandemic revenue for Q3 and Q4 to hit ~69B. 1. https://www.emirates.com/media-centre/emirates-group-announces-2019-20-results/\n2. https://www.emirates.com/media-centre/emirates-group-announces-2020-21-results\n3. https://centreforaviation.com/news/emirates-group-revenue-up-81-in-h1fy2022-1102208\n4. https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1347939 e. missing reference"], [1333, "2021-11-11T15:20:52Z", [0.89], ""], [86367, "2021-11-11T00:50:49Z", [0.0], "The H1 results are out and the implied required revenue rate for H2 is around 47bn (which is close to pre-pandemic revenues for H2 which i feel is clearly not possible). \nComing down from 90% to 0% (Should have never gone so high in the first place)\n "], [691, "2021-11-05T18:45:46Z", [0.88], ""], [102642, "2021-11-04T17:04:40Z", [0.83], ""], [62808, "2021-10-31T16:51:14Z", [0.95], ""], [691, "2021-10-31T15:48:44Z", [0.8], ""], [27661, "2021-10-27T10:08:19Z", [0.55], ""], [34959, "2021-10-26T04:28:04Z", [0.83], "No change in forecast today, this article's (1) main points are summarized below; - 6000 additional employees to come on-board over 6 months;\n- 90% of network now restored; \n- 70% of pre-pandemic capacity by EoY; and\n- return to pre-pandemic numbers by Mid 2022.
