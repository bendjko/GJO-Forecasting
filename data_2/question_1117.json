One is resignation of one of the \"cooler heads\" in AMLO's government, Urzua, Mexico's finance minister in July, with sharp critique of the AMLO's policies. Secondly, Trump delayed applying tariffs on Mexican goods in June in anticipation of Mexico preventing migrants travelling to the US. My guess is the traders' expectations that Trump's administration will review Mexico following its promises and may still establish tariffs. \nThere is of course also a background of a continuing trade spat between the US and China and looming world economy crisis because of that. When something like this is happening, investors run for safety of the dollar - during the financial crisis in 2008, dollar paradoxically appreciated.\nSo it looks that while fundamentals push for peso appreciation, the sentiment takes over and forces depreciation.

Also of note is the fact that the timeframe for this question is rather long, which suggests a wide range of possibilities.
