Israel's coronavirus case numbers are coming down and less time's available for an event that would lead to postponement, so I'm lowering my estimate of such a postponement's likelihood to 2% (half the historical rate). Over the last week's polling, Likud's average estimated seat lead over its nearest opponent is now 13, around 7 times larger than the typical fortnightly change in the polling average since October. So with under four fortnights until the scheduled election, the probability of that seat lead falling sufficiently, under a Gaussian random walk, is less than 0.1%. Realistically, therefore, Likud will only fail to win most seats in an out-of-model scenario, such as a significant large-party merger (very unlikely, given the opposing parties' rhetoric and electoral incentives and the remaining time); a rapid, condemnatory, and poll-shifting decision against Netanyahu in his trial (rapidity and poll-shifting both being unlikely); or a major vaccine failure for which the government is blamed (extremely unlikely).

Israel's postponed only one of its 23 scheduled legislative elections to date (in 1973, mentioned by @TheLopen and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_Israel), but either the coronavirus crisis or Passover's effect on the vote count could be reason to do so.

Israeli opinion polling's historically rather accurate (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2020_Israeli_legislative_election and its equivalents) and, over the last week of polling pulled from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2021_Israeli_legislative_election, Likud's average estimated lead over its closest opponent is 10.5 seats. This is four times the standard deviation in that estimated seat lead over the last three months of polls so, even supposing volatility over the coming three months is twice as high, a normally distributed Likud seat lead would have a 2% chance of being less than 0.5. A fat-tailed distribution'll be more appropriate, some party consolidation's likely, and big news events will likely increase volatility (evidence in Netanyahu's trial, the vaccination process, ?), so I'll use a more conservative estimate of 90% for the probability of Likud winning most seats, conditioned on the election going ahead as scheduled."], [31859, "2021-01-02T21:47:14Z", [0.31, 0.49, 0.2], ""], [97648, "2021-01-02T21:00:19Z", [0.75, 0.15, 0.1], ""], [96954, "2021-01-02T20:37:39Z", [0.7, 0.2, 0.1], "The only occurrence of an election being delayed in Israeli history was during the Yom Kippur War.

However, following the call for new elections last month 8 Blue and White legislators have left the party for various other parties or left politics all together. Current polling has them dropping below the 3.25% required to win seats. With the collapse of Blue and White it appears Likud will easily be the party with the most votes. Though there is a new offshoot of Likud called New Hope which is going to split the vote, currently new hope is polling at 17 seats while Likud is at 29. Though their odds appear good, the corruption trial against Likud leader Netanyahu will begin in February just as the campaigning is reaching its peak. The 20% chance of Likud not holding the most seats is for the possibility of Likud support collapsing if the trial were to go badly and Netanyahu was no longer able to run. https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-heads-elections-nothing-different-everything-has-changed https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.timesofisrael.com/in-1st-election-poll-predicts-gantzs-blue-and-white-will-fail-to-enter-knesset/amp/ Election data is from Wikipedia \n"], [87440, "2021-01-02T17:24:22Z", [0.73, 0.24, 0.03], ""], [88422, "2021-01-02T16:54:18Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [90709, "2021-01-02T15:39:14Z", [0.15, 0.6, 0.25], ""], [78587, "2021-01-02T14:06:18Z", [0.01, 0.99, 0.0], ""], [94783, "2021-01-02T10:17:10Z", [0.5, 0.3, 0.2], ""], [79142, "2021-01-02T01:57:34Z", [0.75, 0.2, 0.05], ""], [11447, "2021-01-02T01:04:57Z", [0.81, 0.17, 0.02], "Elections are scheduled so I have no election as a very outside chance.

I looked at the previous election to see how long this pattern has lasted and was surprised to see that Blue and White had been a serious contender for most voted party [3], but now barely gets the half the votes it used to.

Using the average of the Channel 12 and Kan polls (https://www.timesofisrael.com/as-knesset-to-dissolve-likud-leads-in-polls-but-no-clear-majority-for-netanyahu/) we have Likud at 28.5 seats and New Hope on 19 seats. The polls disagreed on the third party but agreed that it would only get around 15/16 votes. Unfortunately, there was no margin of error disclosed on the Kan poll but assuming it was similar to that of Channel 12 (4.2% or 5 seats), we get a probability of 97.5% of a Likud majority.  Allocating a 6% chance of the election being postponed from March 23rd for Covid/Political reasons, and smoothing the resultant Likud probability by 8% as it is early in the cycle, and we haven't had a lot of polls, I get an 84% chance of Likud.\n"], [1333, "2020-12-22T23:07:30Z", [0.35, 0.65, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2020-12-22T22:43:17Z", [0.25, 0.75, 0.0], ""], [97462, "2020-12-22T20:57:32Z", [0.7, 0.3, 0.0], ""], [53391, "2020-12-22T19:45:50Z", [0.75, 0.25, 0.0], "Knesset has 120 members, 36 are likud (largest party).
