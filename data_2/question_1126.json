The official rationale for the project is that Europe needs more gas, and this is the best way to get it. Yet the pipeline, combined with other planned projects, will actually reduce Russia\u2019s export capacity. And even as Nord Stream 2 promises \u201cthe further diversification of energy routes to Europe,\u201d it will actually concentrate Russian gas exports into a single pipeline corridor in the Baltic Sea, where it will bypass Ukraine and reduce that country\u2019s gas load to 10 percent of current capacity (Para. 1). And Putin himself may be a bigger danger. The history of Nord Stream 1, which terminates in Germany just as the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is planned to do, demonstrates that he\u2019s more than willing to use pipelines for political leverage. After the commissioning of Nord Stream 1, he wanted to keep a tight grip on gas supplies to Ukraine, reducing them when the country angered him\u2014either by cutting off some lines or hiking prices. But when Europe announced that it would resell Russian gas back to Ukraine at a lower price than Russia had offered, Putin got angry and in June 2014 threatened to punish the involved parties\u2014Austrian, German, and Slovakian firms\u2014by reducing the supply of Russian gas to their home countries (Para. 7). *\nReference\n*\nKorchemkin, M.

[1] ~~~\nContext\n~~~ The alternative route could add half a year to the timeline (initially Nordstream constructor eyed a year-end start of flows, whereas now they say it can be second half of 2020) according to one estimate [2] Steps necessary: a third route will need to go through stakeholder comment and full environmental review [3] as well as consultation with countries in relation to the UN's Espoo Convention.  ~~~\nBase rates\n~~~ The environmental review is a significant delay. Under the EU EIA directive, reviews take a considerable amount of time. Speaking of Base Rates [4] states \"The average duration of an EIA procedure was estimated to be 11.3 months but figures range from 5 to 27 months. The average time taken to reach the final EIA decision after completion of the consultations was 2 months.\" It is somewhat telling that Nordstream is appealing the DEA's decision for an assessment of a third route [5], most likely because they realize it makes their original timeline for production by year\u2019s end infeasible. ~~~\nFurther info\n~~~ After the environmental review is complete, Denmark would have to make a decision. It has discretion to reject it and has the support of the US in dragging it out, though is probably under pressure from Germany to approve it.

The agency is holding a consultation on Gazprom's application, and stakeholders can submit their views until 10 July.

Moreover, experts argue that \"sanctions against the members of the consortium financing Nord Stream 2 are not going to be that damaging, since Russia, or even Gazprom alone, can gather enough funds to continue building the project.  Denmark is under pressure as well, since, as @M_W mentioned, Nord Stream 2 is going to appeal the decision of the Danish Energy Agency on submitting a third application. It is claimed that the Danish decision didn't have legal legitimacy and has cost the Russian side 2-3 billion krones. Hence, when the situation is so tense, the probability of the dramatic development of the events is possible, meaning Denmark might be pushed to make final decision.

Furthermore, the US seems willing to impose sanctions on companies involved in the Nord Stream 2 project. Deteriorating US-German relations probably decrease the likelihood that Trump will drop his plans to impose sanctions.  These developments further intensify the pressure on Denmark to delay or decline the approval of Nord Stream 2.

Firstly, due to the introduction of a new law the foreign minister can still veto that initial route option going through the territorial zone of Denmark. He could do so on grounds of national security. As for the other route options it is more a question of delay than not granting at all, as in the 'worst case scenario' for Nord Stream 2 AG the pipeline would still be laid, however in international waters instead of the EEZ of Denmark. Yet, the delay so far has already altered the predicted day of finishing of the project, as Nord Stream 2 was supposed to be finished by the end of 2019 (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gazprom-nordstream-2-denmark/nord-stream-2-says-denmark-tries-to-delay-pipeline-as-it-seeks-third-route-option-idUSKCN1RR15F).  In light of recent developments of March 2019 that the Danish Energy Agency has asked Nord Stream 2 AG for the assessment of a new, third, to investigate a South-Eastern route on the continental shelf of Bornholm, I do not believe a decision will take place before the end of the year. The DEA makes this decision based on the opinion that the most environmental good and safe route will be chosen. However, now for this route as well public hearings will take place which are scheduled to begin mid-June. The public consultation of the application received in April 2017 took until September 2017, the public consultation of the application received in August 2018 took until December 2018. It therefore can be assumed that the public consultation of the new proposed route will take just as long and then counting in the decision-making process that still needs to be done afterwards that all in all the process will take substantially longer than until December 2019 (https://en-press.ens.dk/pressreleases/new-nord-stream-2-application-for-two-southern-route-options-2860674) Lastly, the DEA clearly states that it cannot say when a permission can be granted, therefore leaving little hope for a quick handling of the issue, last of all since it is not in their interest to do so.  Another thing to consider for the substantial delay are the recent Danish parliament elections. Now a new government is to be formed and it can be awaited what their stance on the take is, to speed up the process of keep it hanging lose. \nFurthermore, there is political and economic pressure on Denmark from two sides. On the one hand there are claims being made by Gazprom, the Nord Stream 2 operating company, that they found the extensive delay illegal and would want to be compensated for the millions of losses resulting form the delay, this could pressure Denmark and the DEA to eventually speed up the process not to face any charges or costs from this side. On the other hand, US President Trump and the US Congress are not a fan of the Nord Stream 2, claiming it would alter geopolitical imperatives and make Europe and the EU more reliant on Russia(n gas). Denmark therefore experiences political pressure from the US to delay the process, as the US was even threatening European cooperating companies with sanctions for supporting the Nord Stream 2 process. As, additionally, having a Russian gas pipeline in one's backyard is no favourable position to be in for any country, Denmark has no reason to speed up the process and make sure that it will not delay the constructions any further (https://www.rt.com/business/461296-nord-stream-us-denmark-novak/ ; https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/21/nord-stream-2-explained-what-it-is-and-why-its-proving-controversial.html ; https://politiken.dk/udland/art7237024/Dansk-pokerspil-om-Nord-Stream-2-koster-Putin-og-energiselskaber-milliarder ; https://borsen.dk/nyheder/politik/artikel/1/382769/dansk_spil_om_nord_stream_2_koster_russere_milliarder.html)  All in all, however, previous handling of the Nord Stream 2 issues and other cases from the DEA show a processing time of at least 7 months, which would make an approval date to be clearly later than December 2019, and hence substantially delaying the process (https://politiken.dk/udland/art7237024/Dansk-pokerspil-om-Nord-Stream-2-koster-Putin-og-energiselskaber-milliarder).

I was too focused on the opinion of a single researcher, who anticipated that the pressure on the Danish government was bigger that it seems to have been. Very little has been said about the Nord Stream 2 project from Danish politicians, so it seems to be a low priority topic at the moment. National elections in Denmark is most likely the cause of this.  If I were to guess, then I think the government are deliberately delaying the decision until after the election because it's such a touchy subject. By delaying it they can just hand over the tricky decision to their political opposition if they lose power. Should they end up maintaining power, then they are pretty much just at status quo and can pick up what where they left off.  The Russian company have been asked to asses a third route option by the Danish authorities, which they are seeing as deliberate efforts to delay the process. Legal actions against Denmark is supposedly being considered. (https://www.energyworldmag.com/nord-stream-2-gas-pipeline-could-be-delayed-because-of-denmark/) Manfred Weber have stated he will stop the project, if he becomes the next president of the EU commission. Another reason why a \"wait-and-see-strategy\" from the Danish government seems sensible (https://jyllands-posten.dk/international/europa/ECE11336468/tysk-euspidskandidat-vil-stoppe-nord-stream-2/). Summarising it all, before June 1st is off the table. Before August 30th is equally unlikely, but I'm retaining a small probability for this option. The two remaining options are pretty much equal imo. There are too much uncertainty because of the election, but judging by the past behaviour of the Danish government I have chosen to leave a slightly higher probability in the \"not before December option\"."], [67423, "2019-05-19T19:36:21Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.55, 0.45], "Update: Us Sens.

Sanctions would affect the vessels involved in the construction, deny visas to those executives of the vessel companies, and companies that provide insurance for the parts of the project. \nThe relationship with US is the center of Denmark's hesitancy to approve the project, as the US has long been Denmark's closest international ally. In proposing, and potentially approving such a bill, US lawmakers are underlining their opposition to the project and the political importance of it. Consequently, DK would have a hard time approving a project that an ally is sanctioning. This development only supports the hypothesis that Denmark will delay their decision even further.

It is very unlikely that the current prime minister and its government will decide about the Nord Stream 2 (NS2) project after they have been delaying it for the last years. It is more likely that the current government will postpone any decision to avoid responsibility in the case of a change of government. Additionally, the Danish Parliament will have its summer recess soon after the general election. As a result, it seems extremely unlikely that any decision will be made before the 31 of August 2019.  The first Nord Stream project from 2011 was already very controversial back then. Indeed, the notion that the new pipeline is only an economical project was contested by critics who claimed that the pipeline will be used by Russia to leverage its influence in Europe and to diminish the dependence on transit countries (a goal shared among western European states - especially Germany). In 2011 Sweden and Denmark approved the construction of underwater pipelines through their Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) after Russia had abandoned its goal to establish an offshore platform close to the coast of Sweden (the Swedish government feared that this platform could be misused for intelligence gathering or as base for military operations).  So, what changed in the meanwhile? It\u2019s the perception of Russia as a trustworthy partner for the West which changed mainly due to its support for Bashar Al-Assad in Syria and for separatists in Eastern Ukraine. Not only did Russia block any decisions in the UN Security Council addressing Russian allies, this time it aids its partners with arms supply and direct military assistance \u2018on the ground\u2019. Furthermore, Russia challenges treaties and security structures established in the end of the cold war and directly opposes the EU and USA. As a result, the debates on joint programs with Russia, and particularly NS2, emphasize more the political rather than economical aspects nowadays. Therefore, undermining the dependence on Ukraine as a transit country has became more important than it had been during the construction of Nord Stream 1 as it alters into a threat for the Ukrainian stability and ultimately its sovereignty. The EU commission, several EU countries (specifically Baltic and Eastern European states) and the US oppose the Nord Stream 2 project based on the argument that it would leverage Russia\u2019s political influence in the EU. The US also threatens the project with imposing sanctions on involved businesses and vessels. Denmark avoided a final decision so far. On the one hand it shares the concerns stated by adversaries of NS2. On the other hand, it doesn\u2019t want to undermine its diplomatic relations to Germany (one of Denmark\u2019s most important trading partners). So how will it decide in the end?  A view into Sweden might help to estimate if Denmark will approve the NS2 in this year or not. Sweden is like Denmark a Scandinavian country; hence, both share a common history and (to some degree) political traditions. Furthermore, all Scandinavian countries promote regional partnership through cooperative programs in various areas of the society. It is therefore very likely that the Swedish stance on NS2 would influence Denmark\u2019s final decision. The Swedish Minister of Enterprise and Innovation stated that despite concerns about the increased political influence of Russia and a probable decline of Ukraine\u2019s revenue, Sweden \u201ccannot reject this project\u201d (quoted from EURACTIV). The reason is that the pipeline will be built outside of Sweden\u2019s territorial waters, hence, Sweden is obliged to allow Nord Stream to proceed with its project pursuant to the UN Convention on the Laws of the Sea (UNCLOS). Denmark delayed the first proposal of Nord Stream as it planned to build the pipelines through Danish territorial waters. Nonetheless, the last proposals suggest courses through the Danish EEZ. Like Sweden, Denmark would be faced with the decision to adhere to the UNCLOS or to deliberate ignore it (the latter seems extremely unlikely to happen regarding the fact that Denmark is a democracy and that its maritime industry relies on the UNCLOS). Another aspect which will further increase the pressure on Denmark is that the EU isn\u2019t able to block the pipeline through its institutions. There is no legal ground for the EU to challenge the project as the latter one adheres to all necessary obligations under the UNCLOS.  For these purposes this forecast estimates that Denmark will try to delay the pipeline as long as possible as it shares the criticism of NS2. Demanding a third environmental impact assessment, a process which requires months, would enable Denmark to prolong the project beyond the 1st of December 2019. However, there\u2019s a possibility that Denmark will approve the project before the end of this year regarding that Nord Stream adheres to international law. Sweden approving the project, despite having severe concerns, may be a precedent which Denmark might follow, hence, increasing the overall likelihood that Denmark will approve the project after all.

With that being said, the people behind the Russian company that is currently constructing the pipeline have critiqued Danish politicians for not taking a decision, as the pipeline is fast approaching Bornholm, which could speed up the process. On the other hand, one must believe that the coming election will influence the choice, both the EU election and the Danish parliamentary elections. Some Danish politicians have expressed worries that the pipeline will undermine the EU's energy strategy, as well as the fact that Russia will use the pipeline to put pressure on other European states, and state that Russia has shown willingness to do this before. (https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/regionale/bornholm/omdiskuteret-gasledning-naermer-sig-danmark-dag-dag-politikerne-bruger).  Earlier this month it was made known that USA Senators are drafting a bill to sanction work on the pipeline.

In contrast, the pipeline has already been approved by Germany and Sweden, two of Denmark's neighbours, putting Denmark in a difficult situation seeing as they are all close allies.       "], [67424, "2019-05-15T09:59:39Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.85], "The Danish position towards building the Nord Stream 2 route, that is often described as a \"highly controversial project\", has been quite obvious to be negative, since the country\u2019s been trying hard to postpone making a final decision. It is believed by number of east European, Nordic and Baltic Sea countries that the Nord Stream 2 will increase EU dependence/resilience on Moscow. The major concerns that occurred over the past few years are: (1) the route will double the amount of Russian gas delivered to Germany through the Baltic States; (2) will \u201cmake little commercial sense\u201d; and (3) will lead to \u201cexert energy leverage over Western Europe\u201d for Putin. In the beginning the European Commission, the Baltic States and Poland as well joined the United States in opposing to the idea of the pipeline. However, Finland, Sweden and Germany have already approved the construction of the pipeline. Therefore, the Danish refusal is a major challenge for the Gazprom project. Besides, in February 2019, the EU allowed the project to be proceeded, a deal that was compromising the positions of different states was introduced by Germany and France. The pipeline must meet several EU requirements and the process is going to be led by Germany. Furthermore, it needs to be noted, that the route will leave Ukraine without lucrative gas transit fees, that the country still heavily depends on. The project is also contradicting the restrictive measures that the EU and the US have imposed on Russia due to the invasion of Ukraine in 2014.  The only country left to issue a permit to allow the construction is Denmark and the delay of the construction has already cost the project up to 750 DKK million. Denmark has already received two route applications from the Russian-led company. The first was submitted more than two years ago, but in March 2019 the Danish energy agency asked the applicant to asses a third route option, that will go along the southern route delineated in Danish territorial waters. This action is perceived as \u201ca deliberate attempt to delay the project\u2019s completion\u201d and might delay the project for one more year. However, the territorial waters of Denmark that the southern route goes through is subject to a specific law that allows Denmark to view the topic of the construction of Nord Stream 2 as an issue of its foreign and security policy. Hence, the investigation of the environmental impacts for a route south of Bornholm in the continental shelf area is necessary and needs to go through a public hearing as well. The process of assessing the impact of the third route (that has not been created yet) on the environment will be time consuming as well and delay the process of making decision by Denmark.  The project has sparked serious concerns about sanctions as well. Denmark is kind of in between Germany and the US and would rather have seen the EU blocking the route in the first place. The US government has warned Europe several times that restrictive measures would have been imposed if there were steps taken in order to finalize the Nord Stream 2. Currently the US is working on a bill that will be introduced next week and will target companies and vessels involved in the construction of pipelines for the project. According to the draft of the bill that the Foreign Policy obtained, the people who continue to sell or lease boats, that will be used for the construction, will become subject to a US travel ban and assets freeze in the US. Moreover, different types of penalties will be imposed on the people, who are supporting the project either financially or technically. The bill mainly targets two companies \u2013 Switzerland\u2019s Allseas and Italy\u2019s Saipem, that are the \u201ctwo of only a handful of companies worldwide that operate pipe-laying vessels\u201d and will pressure the five partner companies of Gazprom - Uniper and Wintershall from Germany, Anglo-Dutch Shell, OMV from Austria, and Engie of France. It is for sure, that imposing sanctions from the US will delay the process of construction and will postpone Denmark\u2019s final decision as well.  Nord Stream 2 has been in process for eight years already. If it took this long to come to this state, it will take at least 1,5 years until the final decision is made by Denmark and the constructions are finalized. Hence, I do believe that Denmark won\u2019t approve the construction of Nord Stream 2 through its territorial waters or Exclusive Economic Zone before December 1, 2019. However, I'm giving the two possibilities that imply Denmark approving the routes before December 2019 in total 15% chance, since there\u2019s a huge pressure from the EU countries on Denmark and the deadline of the project itself.

Denmark doesn't want to antagonize superpowers as the US, so much against the NS2, plus, has submitted an application for a third route option for the pipeline: this act it's a strategy to postpone further the construction of the NS2. In spiete its will Denmark has not many tools to use. Indeed, \"Denmark still has the possibility to veto the initial route option after it passed a law in 2017 that could allow it to ban the pipeline from passing through its territorial waters on security grounds.

As it is argued by countries like Poland, the Baltic states and Ukraine, this is clearly the project that increases Russia's influence over Europe via dependence Russian gas. As harsh as it sounds, successfully implemented NordStream 2  would become a highly powerful tool in Putin's hands to do the impact on European decisions. In addition, this project goes against Europe's energy policy in terms of diversification of the energy sources and of transit countries within the EU itself (with the Nord Stream II pipeline, Russia would export even more towards the EU and Germany would acquire a predominant position as a point of entry of natural gas (30% of gas would be arriving in the EU via Germany, an increase from the current figure of 15%). Presenting the context, it quite well reveals the reasoning why Denmark is working so hard on delaying the approval. There are key points why I don't expect for Denmark to approve NordStream 2 before at least before December 2019: Year: 2011 was the year when first Nord Stream was launched and easily approved by the Danish Government. From the very beginning, the project was seen as highly beneficial for Germany, firstly, in terms of financial benefits. Being a close ally to Germany, Denmark was likely to intend to present a nice gesture towards Germany by approving the project without further investigations. It is worth mentioning that Poland, the Baltics back then were already sending the warning signals about Russia's, specifically, Putin's ventures. However, Denmark and Germany, like most of other EU countries were denying it until 2014, when Russia started the war against Ukraine. That was definitely one of the turning points in the process of the Nordstream 2 project. More and more countries had to admit themselves first that the pipeline from Russia is, first of all, political project rather than an economic one. Quoting the re-elected Head of Danish Government Lars Lykke Rasmussen, the geopolitical situation in the region has changed, and the \u201cpolitical side\u201d of the gas pipeline can no longer be ignored.  The U.S. Factor: it was stated very clearly that Trump's administration opposes the implementation of Nord Stream II. In NATO summit in the fall of 2018, Trump even accused Germany of depending on Russian gas. The U.S is a strategic partner to Denmark, hence, it is quite unlikely that Denmark would like to find herself in the position of such accusations. What is more, the U.S. is talking more and more on imposing sanctions against those EU companies that are financing Nord Stream 2. As a result, the costs can be not only in terms of diplomacy but, also turn into huge fines, as well.  Foreign minister's veto: in 2018 December deputies accepted an amendment that allows the foreign minister to veto any project on the continental shelf of Denmark if he believes that this threatens the country's interests in the diplomatic and defence sphere. In February minister himself stated that \"nothing of what Russia is doing now can be an argument in favour of approval.\".  Danish Election: to my mind, all the context explained before is in favour of further Denmark's delay of the project until at least December 2019. However, I should add some words why I do not believe at all that agreement can be reached before June or before the end of August. EU parliament election is on the 23-26 of May, Danish election on 5th May, to bring NordStream2 project issues before those elections, to my opinion, would be suicide for any party. If you do not want to look from the perspective of politics, environment questions are rising as well. Hence, no chances before June. Another question is how much a newly elected government should be willing to resolve the issue of NordStream 2 during the first months of the cadence and, over the summer. I do not see it coming.  Overall, I see it highly likely that the project will be further delayed and approval won't be given by Denmark before December 2019. As there might be some factors that I did not think about or that are not available publicly, I left a 10 % chance of project to be approved during autumn. Mainly, my idea is that it is happening this year, this is only appropriate and reasonable time do it. However, I am sticking to my belief that it won't happen.

As discussed in my original forecast on this question, ultimately Denmark will not have any decision-making power on a pipeline that does not go through it's territorial waters but will attempt to delay as long as possible. Since the pipeline is due to be complete at the end of the year, Denmark's approval will likely come as late as they possibly can make it -- after September. Nord Stream 2 has already said that it is on track, though Danish actions may push the completion date back. How long of a delay Denmark can create will determine when it's approval finally comes through. Equal weighting is given to each timeframe after September, accounting for their wish to postpone further on the one hand (giving an after December 1 approval) and their lack of veto power to really do anything about it on the other (giving a between September 1 and November 30 approval).

In my view, the procedure will be time consuming and prospects for easy-coming authorization in the near future are futile. Having in mind that the last application for construction including and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) involving an alternative route was just submitted on 15th April 2019 (nearly a 9 months after the last application submitted and a year and a half after the original application was passed to Denmark for examination. Therefore so far, for Denmark to conclude that a route does not comply with its interests take nearly 9 months. Moreover, even though the application for construction together with an EIA for an alternative route south-east of\u00a0Bornholm was  filed on 15 April 2019\u00a0\u00a0(https://www.nord-stream2.com/permitting-denmark/south-eastern-route/&gt; ) , the permitting process is far from being in the last phase of decisionmaking. Before the Danish Energy Agency to decide on Nord Stream 2's alternative routes, there has to be a public consutlation phase, which is yet to be announced. Following the public consultation period, all statements are given to Nord Stream 2 ( according to their website page, see above link), and the latter need to provide answers to the national and international stakeholders opinions and concerns. It is only after NS2 provide satisfactory answers to the given statements following the public consultation period that the Danish Energy Agency will decide on the last so far application for alternative route.  One insight that this calculation is not putting thought enough on could be another's actor inclusion, meaning what if NS2 try to get away from Denmark's way to deal with Russia ( having in mind recent cyber security issues involving Denmark-Russia relationship). This could potentially mean for NS2 to pass through Polish Exclusive Economic Zone near the Bornholm island. This however seems not as possible as Gazprom still resting on Denmark to permit the building of the pipelines, as Poland is among the biggest opponents of Nord Stream 2 in the European Union discussions over energy independence specifically due to the political influence coming along iwth the Russian gas.  Final remark, the public phase is not yet published as a date or period and my calculation rests on the multiple steps involved in the permitting procedure plus the past behavior from Denmark which is significantly postponing such decision. However, I am unable to find information how long the period is for the public consultation (conflicting dates on the internet - it could be 8-10 days but it could be 30-90 days), therefore there is minimal but still possible opportunity for Denmark to reach a decision in the period \"Between 1 September and 30 November 2019, inclusive\" instead of my prime suggestion which is \"Not before 1st December 2019\". \n"], [67423, "2019-04-30T14:22:43Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.65, 0.35], "Update: Manfred Weber, the conservative candidate to lead the EU commission, says that he will work to halt the Nord Stream II project, should he be chosen for the powerful position.

This would make any decision between Now and the end of June highly political and highly unlikely due to the fact that it would open up the current Danish Government to  criticism. Therefore, it does make political sense for Denmark to approve the pipeline before June 2019. For this reason I think there is a 0% chance of that happening. Moreover, after the election, any new government would have to form a new cabinet and take time to transition to leadership and making a decision on Nord Stream 2 so early on has the potential to undermine the authority of the Danish government in the eyes of their voters. Therefore, I find it highly unlikely that it'll be approved soon after elections. Of course this logic really depends on the party platforms of running parties and which party wins the election, but since elections haven't started it is hard to speculate these factors.  Now looking at the actual objections, Denmark has requested an environmental impact assessment, before they can approve the pipeline. Nord Stream 2's CEO Mathias Warnig has claimed that this request could take years to complete (https://industryeurope.com/denmark-puts-brakes-on-nord-stream-2/). Which means if Denmark is truly sincere in its request than it is practically impossible that Denmark will issue it's approval before the December 1st 2019.  Nord Stream 2 is also facing opposition within the EU as Donald Tusk has characterized the project as not being in the EU's interest. Moreover, a serious candidate for the new EU Commission President, Manfred Weber,  has alreadry come down hard on Nord Stream 2  (https://www.euractiv.com/section/eu-elections-2019/news/weber-seeks-powers-to-stop-nord-stream-2/). All of this reflects a growing dissatisfaction and opposition to the project from most of the EU, whom are likely putting pressure on Denmark to continue to stall. Because, in the meantime, the EU has already increased regulations and Nord Stream 2 has threaten to take the EU to court over \"discrimination\" (https://www.politico.eu/article/nord-stream-2-threatens-to-take-the-eu-to-court-over-new-gas-rules/).

Germany is  Denmark\u2019s most important European relation, whereas the US has long been the most prominent international ally. Lastly, Russia is of major importance in relation to Denmark\u2019s pending negotiations in the Arctic. Hence, many interests need to be balanced.  Currently, Denmark has two different Nord Stream 2 solutions to consider. One, the original plan, will have the pipeline pass through Denmark\u2019s territorial waters which means that Denmark can refuse this particular solution. The other plan will lead the pipeline North of the Danish island Bornholm and into the exclusive economic zone. This plan requires an official approval (on the basis of an environmental impact assessment), but it cannot be denied by Denmark. Denmark is yet to make decisions on any of these solutions. In addition to the two solutions that the Nord Stream 2 project has officially applied for, the Danish Energy Agency has asked the Nord Stream 2 project to provide an environmental assessment of another route closer to Poland. This seemingly indicates yet another delay in the process.  With the Danish general election coming up in sometime soon (before June 17th), the Danish government is most likely not going to make a decision before the election. A new government would need time to constitute itself after the election and the Danish parliament officially breaks for summer vacation between June and October, so for a decision to be made over the summer seems unlikely. Moreover, it seems unlikely that a new government would have this particular case as at top priority. In addition to this, Manfred Weber has announced that he would seek to stop the Nord Stream 2 project, should he be chosen as the new president of the EU commission, thereby moving the final decision away from Denmark and into the realm of the EU (something Denmark has long been attempting too). A decision that would relieve Denmark of its current predicament of choosing between Germany and the US. It would therefore be likely that Denmark will continue its current course of dragging out the process.  However, as Denmark\u2019s future negotiations in the Arctic will be aided by a good relationship with Russia, Denmark would gain from making a decision sooner rather than later \u2013 either to show good-will towards Russia by approving Nord Stream 2 in Denmark\u2019s territorial waters. Or, in case of a denial, to leave enough time to let the Russian annoyance settle before the Artic negotiations commence. Moreover, Denmark will need to provide an approval of the environmental assessment, as the route through the exclusive economic zone cannot be denied.  Hence, I find it highly unlikely that any decisions will be made before September 1st. Most likely, a decision will be made between September 1st and November 30th, however, a significant likelihood remains that the decision could also be pushed to after December 1st.

For this reason, I'm skeptical also about the idea of approving it in the months following the election, which will be a government transition period.\n- in the end of 2018 Denmark has put an end to the dispute with Poland about the maritime borders in the Baltic Sea: this has allowed Danish Emergency Agency to ask for an evaluation of the eventual environmental risks caused by the pipeline. We should remember Denmark is very concerned about environmental issues\n- EU is also skeptical for multiple reasons: it doesn\u2019t want to rely on Russia dependency on gas, in particular now that the sanctions are still active and because of the unresolved dispute in Crimea. Moreover, EU has recently changed the project, and now it\u2019s under the European Law. Also, for EU this stream represents an energy security issue, because Gazprom has the monopole of the pipeline.\n- EU is already building the TAP (trans Adriatic pipeline), in order to diversify gas supplies importing it from Azerbaijan. I don\u2019t see a lot of coherence in implementing a project as Nord Stream 2, with the opposite effect of relying on Russian supplies.\n- Russia has launched an alternative to bypass Denmark, focusing on the Balcan route and export gas through those countries\n- Among the \"against Nord stream 2\" there are US, Baltic countries and Poland, all of them worried about the rely of Europe on Russian gas. US is an historical competitor of Russia in the economic military and political fields, while Poland and Baltic states have historically been scared and threatened by the power of Russia, so their rejection is due to this fear However, \n- So far, the percentage of gas consumed in Europe are 74% imported from Russia, 34% from Norway and 10% from Algeria. But the gas in the north of Europe (Northern Sea), is becoming scarcer and will be necessary finding other ways to cover the European energetic needs. \n- Germany, which has a strong role in European policy and economy, is pressing for the construction of the pipeline, assuming it would bring economic advantages.\n- Russia wants to avoid the passage through Ukraine and the dependency on it to transport its product. In order to accomplish this aim, the Nord stream is the best solution so it could pressure for its construction.

The request could delay the permitting procedure to build the pipeline in Denmark's exclusive economic zone. There is no timeline available for the process, DEA said. Once Nord Stream 2 provides the requested environmental impact assessment, it will have to undergo normal procedures including public hearings, the agency said. A decision will depend on the completion of this process, it said. Nord Stream 2 will \"carefully evaluate the request\" to include the route option in its environmental assessment, the operator said. But no decision has been made on two pending permit applications for the previously requested routes, Nord Stream 2 said. The original route would pass through Denmark's territorial waters while an alternative route would only pass through the country's exclusive economic zone. The Danish government has previously said it could block or delay construction of the pipeline in its waters for security reasons. Russian state-controlled Gazprom has already received permits for construction from all other countries along the 55bn m\u00b3/yr pipeline's proposed route.

However, even though Russia is under sanctions, Nord Stream 2 (from now on NS2), a Russia-Germany undersea gas pipe that has divided Europeans and angered America, is not. Day by day, the companies contracted by Gazprom, the Russian state-owned gas giant and NS2\u2019s sole shareholder, are laying their concrete-coated steel pipe segments on the bed of the Baltic Sea. They aim to finish by the end of the year (https://www.economist.com/europe/2019/02/16/the-nord-stream-2-gas-pipeline-moves-on).  That said, Denmark is the last country still to complete its national permit procedure for the gas pipeline. Several reasons make Denmark unwilling to allow the pipeline (e.g. environmental concerns), however, the most important is because it does not want to rely on Russian (a country with which has already many disputes, especially in relations to the Arctic). In this regard, the members  of the European Parliament have recently expressed a similar view, establishing that the EU should remain open to imposing further sanctions if Russia continues to violate international law and also retraining their concerns that the NS2 project could reinforce the EU\u2018s dependence on Russian gas supplies and threaten the EU internal market. \u201cRussia can\u2019t be considered strategic partner of EU anymore\u201d was the conclusion of the Parliament. For these reasons, a definitive block of the project or a long-lasting period of impasse cannot be excluded. On the other hand, at stakes there are high interests from both sides and most of the project has been already realized.  Coming to my forecast, since the upcoming elections in Denmark, I don\u2019t think that the actual government will take such a sensitive decision in the very last period of its term. Denmark elections are likely to be between May/July (see my forecast about Danish elections), therefore I assess a 0% chance to the first option (Before 1 June 2019). In this regard, I see quite unlikely that the decision could be taken \u201cbetween 1 June and 31 August 2019, inclusive\u201d since the new government will need a period of transition after the election to take power and start discussing sensitive issues like this. Only a strong pression by the EU might led Denmark to choose before, but as the EU in turn is very focused on the upcoming European Election (end of May) I do no see it as likely. Therefore, I assess only a 5% chance in regard to the second option.  An \u201cok\u201d by Denmark to the project (between 1 September and 30 November 2019, inclusive) is more likely than the two previous options. However, considering that Denmark enjoys the support of the European Parliament, the one of the USA (which has strongly criticized the project many times) and also considering that none of the major political parties have expressed a positive opinion regarding the NS2, Denmark, in the end, might not give the ok at all. Furthermore, Russia in the past announced that an alternative route not including Denmark would be possible. On the other hand, as said at stakes there are high interests from both sides and Denmark will consider the matter very accurately before to call itself out.  Concluding, regarding the third possibility (between 1 September and 30 November 2019, inclusive ) a margin of possibility must be left open and thus I assess it with a 20% chance. That said, I see the option \u201cnot before 1 December 2019\u201d by far as the most likely and, therefore, I assess it with a 75% chance.

With or without Danish permits though, the project was never going to be derailed since its EEZ is effectively governed by international laws.  The EU passed new energy laws early this year (Feb 12), ultimately denying Denmark any authority in the decision-making over the project (placing power primarily in the hands of German regulators), while also ensuring its governance over the Russia\u2019s Nord Stream 2. This effectively binds Denmark to the project, removing its capacity for a lengthy delay (Simon, Euractiv 13 Feb 2019). For this reason, and in considering the project is set to be complete this year, it is predicted that the approval will come in the coming months, most likely during the summer or closely thereafter. The rhetoric toward the project in government indicates the approval will still not be a priority though, and surely won\u2019t occur before Danish national elections \u2014 thus before June 1 is considered highly unlikely. After December 1 is considered improbable also, though more likely than before June 1 considering the Danish authority\u2019s stance on the pipeline to date.

The Danish government is the last one, whose approval is still pending. That the project has not proved very popular with the Danish government becomes clear by looking at the approval process to date. Only after Nord Stream 2 submitted its application, the Danish parliament passed the amendment of the Continental Shelf Act (01/01/2018), which enables the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs to veto infrastructure projects handled by the Danish Energy Agency (DEA) in case they run contrary to Danish security interests (https://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/mecklenburg-vorpommern/Nord-Stream-2-Daenemark-lehnt-geplante-Route-ab,nordstream302.html). \nPredicting a possible negative outcome, Nord Stream 2 AG proposed an alternative route - 36 km longer than the original one - but outside of Danish territorial waters, only running through its exclusive economic zone (EEZ). This route can only be prevented/delayed by serious safety or logistical concerns - not political ones. It is considered highly unlikely Denmark would risk rejecting a project in its EEZ for obvious political reasons, given that it has historically relied so heavily on commerce from its important trading route waters. The government would risk being seen as an untrustworthy maritime operator (https://www.forbes.com/sites/davekeating/2018/09/05/as-of-today-russias-controversial-nord-stream-2-pipeline-is-already-underwater/).  On top of its individual concerns, Denmark has experienced fierce lobbying and pressure by Russia, EU allies and the United States. While particular Germany (Denmark\u2019s closest EU partner) and Russia pushed in favor of the 9.5 billion euro project (co-financed by five western firms), the US (traditionally close ally) opposes the project, alongside some Eastern European countries (https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-eu-gazprom-nordstream/russia-led-nord-stream-2-seeks-new-route-to-avoid-danish-waters-idUKKBN1KV118). Hence, it doesn\u2019t come as a surprise that Denmark does not want to act alone on this matter and was particularly interested in a common EU strategy. This decision has been made now. It calls for all import pipelines to meet EU energy market rules by not being directly owned by gas suppliers, applying non-discriminatory tariffs and transparent reporting and allowing at least 10% of capacity to be made available to third parties. This might slow down the building process, but not stop it. In particular, because the updated directive denies the DEA in Denmark a decisive say over the project and puts that power primarily in the hands of German regulators (https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/eu-reaches-deal-on-rules-to-govern-russias-nord-stream-2-pipeline/).  In sum, there is not much Denmark can do about the pipeline now, besides postponing it. The forecast at hand estimates the chance of Denmark issuing the approval before 01/06/19 as of only 10%. Main reason therefore are the elections of the Danish government (that will most likely fall into this time period) and the European Parliament (refer to forecast regarding Danish electoral date). Dealing with this highly political topic within the campaign could harm the government dramatically. Instead, they can just proceed with their strategy of postponing it and hiding behind administrative processes. However, the forecast at hand estimates that the Danish government (independent from which parties will actually lead them) want to get rid of the topic as fast as possible to stop further escalation and pressure moves from the above mentioned countries. By referring to their limited possibilities in the EEZ, they have the perfect excuse for that matter. However, the forecast takes into account that the newly elected government might not want to make a corresponding announcement right after entering (or re-entering) office. Thus, it estimates the chances of the approval being given between 01/09/19 and 30/11/19 higher, as of 50%, than between 01/06/19 and 31/08/19, as of 30%. A small rest chance, that the approval will be delayed until 01/12/19 or later is considered to prevail due to Denmark\u2019s antipathy against the project, which might motivate the Danish government to stand up the pressure and position itself firmly. This chance is, however, perceived as only small, as of 10%."], [67422, "2019-03-08T10:43:43Z", [0.0, 0.6, 0.4, 0.0], "Denmark is postponing the approval for the construction of Nord Stream 2 for political reasons which opposes the context where Nord Stream 1 was built.

In that sense, I expect Denmark not to make a decision before the works come to proximity but in late July-August. In additon, I believe that for economic interests; because the UE is not much willing to hinder the project; and because the German-Russian project will go through Danish waters anyways (using the alternative of EEZ), it is most likely that Denmark will approve the construction of Nord Stream 2 through its territorial waters.

If Russian, German and Gazprom's lobbying will be succesful, it will require time, and a careful bargaining over Denamrk's interests. I think the most likely outcome will be an impatient Gazprom tired of waiting and eventually deciding to adopt the more costly, but possibly time efficient plan B avoiding Denmark's exclusive economic zone - the fact that there is a plan B could be a bargaining device to speed up Denamrk's decision-making or an actual sign that the project will be done without Copenhagen's approval."], [691, "2019-03-07T19:24:31Z", [0.01, 0.01, 0.1, 0.88], ""], [35217, "2019-03-06T20:51:43Z", [0.0, 0.03, 0.2, 0.77], ""], [67418, "2019-03-06T18:04:23Z", [0.05, 0.25, 0.6, 0.1], "Denmark is the last country involved in the Nord Stream 2 project to have not agreed to the construction of the pipeline. Concerned by geopolitical reasons, especially with Russia, Denmark rejects the project, seeing a political negative impact rather than an economic benefit, as see Germany.\nGazprom, the Russian company that is driving the project, has already applied for the first pipeline route in April 2017. Nevertheless, Denmark has made a wait-and-see attitude, asking for a greater examination of the environmental impacts, through an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA).\nNord Stream 2 to counter this voluntary delay submitted on August 10, 2018 a second building permit, allocated with an EIA, for an alternative route in the northwest of Bornholm, this time. This second request is different than the first one, as the second route passes through Denmark's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), where its jurisdiction is severely diminished, unlike the first route through the Danish territorial waters. This second route is only 36km longer than the first, which is not a major obstacle, and Denmark would not be able to block it anymore. In addition, work on the pipeline has already begun, and the closer they get to Denmark, the sooner the construction agreement, whether in its territorial waters or in the EEZ, will be felt.\nDenmark is going to decided very soon between the two projects,  due to the arrival of the pipeline near its waters, and can not therefore refuse an agreement, because the second alternative will be done automatically if the first route is not accepted, and Denmark will therefore lose economic profits due to a excessive wait-and-see attitude. \nIn addition, it should be noted that the Nord Stream 1 project was approved in the Danish waters and is still in service, which strengthens the chances of an agreement in 2019, because the geopolitical consequences in the case of a bad scenario will be there anyway. Secondly, the EIA for the alternative route has shown that the pipeline would have a minor, negligible, and not significant effect for the environment, but also for tourism and even military practices. There is no impact at all.

[3] \"the pipeline looks unstoppable\" [4] so, once again it is about timing.  So, no reason for Denmark to approve too quickly (before June 1st). Also, Denmark will go into general elections not later than June 17th. Better leave the issue to the new government, probably a coalition that will take a while to decide (after August 31st). NS2 is expected to compete works by the end of 2019, probably will take more than 3 months to reach Danish waters (this is a guesstimate). Then, Denmark might simply reject the approval in line with Eastern countries, knowing that this will not change anything under the new routes (would be EEZ, under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, countries cannot block other nations from laying underwater pipelines and cables, so we have to consider this). 25% to this option.

The Danish government hoped that the European Union would block the project thereby avoiding having to make the decision themselves [2]. The EU decided to not block the project, though with some conditions. This has put pressure back on the Danish foreign minister to deliver his considerations on the foreign policy and security dimension of the project, since his approval is one of the last remaining steps. Wanting to avoid further controversies with Germany and Russia, there is a 55% probability that an approval will arrive before June 1st. This year is an election year and that could cause the prioritisation of the project to be lower than expected. The government might delay the approval until sometime after the election, choosing to focus on campaigning and national topics such as health care reform, which has been a priority up until very recently. Waiting even longer is an unlikely option, but the Danish foreign minister have previously used the behaviour of Russia as an excuse for not approving the project. I am not aware of any recent and significant changes in the Danish-Russian relations but is an option for further delay nonetheless.
