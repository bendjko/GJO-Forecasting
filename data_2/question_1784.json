So;\nOutside View:  \nRegarding the possibility of MBS becoming king due to the death or incapacitation of his father---\nKing Salman is 84, has dementia, and had gallbladder surgery in July, although he seems to have recovered from that and there don\u2019t appear to be any new reports of adverse health of the king.  \n@jtrusz had a good outside view analysis of the general stats regarding longevity of the Saudi male population, the typical length of a monarch\u2019s reign, etc\u2026 following that analysis, I\u2019d say that it seems not likely that the king would die or hand over power in the next 6 weeks.\nSome teammates wondered if the King could die of COVID.  I assume that the King lives in a pretty protected bubble, so I doubt that he\u2019d be likely to catch it.  If he did catch it, though, according to my research he could die from it in as little as 2 weeks, given his age.  So in other words between now and Dec 1 would be enough of a time window for Covid to kill the king--- assuming he caught it in the first place.\nInside View:\nOn the question of whether MBS might try to overthrow his father---\nA classmate who is a Saudi national remarked that there has never been a coup in Saudi Arabia, and it is \u201cculturally inconceivable\u201d for a son to usurp a father.  So unless MBS is willing to break some very strong cultural norms (and some would say he already has), seems unlikely that he would brazenly grab power from his father in a coup-like scenario. \nThis classmate predicts that MBS will stay Crown Prince because things are going well in the country, and a coup is unlikely especially if there is stability and prosperity in Saudi.\nHere is an analysis from a State Department colleague who is an expert on the Mid East:\n\u201cThere was some speculation earlier in the year that MBS was clearing the decks (eg detaining/sacking royal family rivals and critics) to accede to the throne around the G20 Summit later this year:  (https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/exclusive-saudi-crown-prince-plans-become-king-novembers-g20-summit). \u201cThat hasn't remained in the media much later in the year after the pandemic took hold, and Covid may have thrown a wrench into his plans - a royal leadership transition could be a lot in the midst of a pandemic and pretty far-reaching cultural reforms.   \u201cSo I think \"No\" is probably the most likely outcome, but there's also a bit of a generational shift going on in the region right now with the Abraham Accords seeming to herald new relationships and priorities.  And the Saudis love Trump, so a Biden win could potentially push them to empower a new monarch to work with a new US admin they see as suspect.  So I don't think it's as farfetched as it might seem.   \u201cI would probably guess something like 35 percent Yes, by becoming king, 5 percent Yes without becoming king, and 60 percent No. \u201c My take:  It\u2019s obvious that MBS plans to become King, and has been maneuvering to make that happen.  The insider knowledge I was able to glean does not seem to think that MBS will become King by natural or political means in the short term.  The time horizon to Dec. 1 is pretty short, reducing the likelihood of events that would elevate MBS to the kingship, but the one big wild card between now and Dec 1 that could play a role is the Nov 21-22 G20 Summit in Riyadh.  I will keep an eye on that event as a potential influencer in the outcome.  \n"], [95728, "2020-10-19T11:58:28Z", [0.09, 0.01, 0.9], "No significant change to the King's health."], [92863, "2020-10-19T11:43:52Z", [0.09, 0.01, 0.9], ""], [27661, "2020-10-19T09:30:36Z", [0.05, 0.0, 0.95], ""], [86658, "2020-10-19T09:08:50Z", [0.34, 0.01, 0.65], ""], [28899, "2020-10-19T03:09:36Z", [0.17, 0.01, 0.82], ""], [12694, "2020-10-19T01:32:35Z", [0.1, 0.0, 0.9], ""], [12694, "2020-10-19T01:32:13Z", [0.15, 0.0, 0.85], ""], [57778, "2020-10-18T23:41:25Z", [0.19, 0.01, 0.8], ""], [57778, "2020-10-18T23:39:42Z", [0.29, 0.01, 0.7], "https://www.the961.com/prince-mohammed-to-be-saudi-king/"], [94889, "2020-10-18T22:51:36Z", [0.1, 0.01, 0.89], "Decrementing as no indication position of power is threatened and no negative news on health of King."], [31275, "2020-10-18T20:33:09Z", [0.5, 0.0, 0.5], "https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/saudi-purges-why-mohammed-bin-salman-can-never-rest\nhttps://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/middle-east/saudi-arabia-s-failure-to-win-human-rights-seat-a-rebuke-to-crown-prince-1.4384480\nhttps://www.the961.com/prince-mohammed-to-be-saudi-king/"], [96450, "2020-10-18T11:16:55Z", [0.02, 0.02, 0.96], ""], [96318, "2020-10-17T23:25:32Z", [0.2, 0.01, 0.79], ""], [96318, "2020-10-17T21:05:35Z", [0.93, 0.07, 0.0], ""], [40584, "2020-10-17T13:15:09Z", [0.02, 0.01, 0.97], ""], [87854, "2020-10-17T09:45:07Z", [0.03, 0.01, 0.96], ""], [92863, "2020-10-17T08:47:30Z", [0.1, 0.01, 0.89], ""], [29646, "2020-10-17T05:36:39Z", [0.01, 0.0, 0.99], "Adjusting for passage of time."], [62808, "2020-10-16T13:12:03Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [61598, "2020-10-15T23:08:05Z", [0.04, 0.0, 0.96], ""], [86658, "2020-10-15T17:14:13Z", [0.35, 0.01, 0.64], ""], [95992, "2020-10-15T14:54:58Z", [0.01, 0.0, 0.99], ""], [96427, "2020-10-15T13:47:33Z", [0.1, 0.0, 0.9], ""], [884, "2020-10-15T02:15:51Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.9], ""], [12694, "2020-10-14T17:46:21Z", [0.01, 0.0, 0.99], ""], [27661, "2020-10-14T16:31:46Z", [0.04, 0.0, 0.96], ""], [38, "2020-10-14T15:44:26Z", [0.02, 0.09, 0.89], "I'm hearing nothing more about MBS' ambitions or how he might achieve them.

The question deadline is 1 December So what is his probability of surviving 2m and 1w?\nActuarial table shows chances of death in 1Y for an 84 year old is 8.8% and chance of death for an 85 year old is 9.7%.\nhttps://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html\n9.7% per year is closer because he is nearly 85 now, but he is very wealthy so can afford much better health care. He also doesn't drink or smoke obviously.  So lets go with 9% chance of death per year. We also notice probability changed by about 10% over a year so a linear interpolation of probability over 2 months will be accurate to about 2%, considerably greater than errors over guessing his current health. So this moves us to 9/12*2.2 = 1.65% of death. We also know he had an apparently successful gall bladder operation in July this year. He isn't dead so the operation itself didn't kill him, and a gall bladder issue doesn't seem to be a typical terminal problem. So this provides as much evidence of bad health as it provides evidence of access to best health treatments money can buy. So, 2% chance of death. There is also a possibility of the king handing over to his successor.  A quick glance at a single article\nhttps://www.brookings.edu/blog/markaz/2017/06/23/will-saudi-arabias-king-salman-abdicate/ The king seems to have had early dementure in 2017 (now is 3 years later).\nThe problem though for abdication is there is no obvious motive. The Crown Prince already does pretty much all of the daily governing, and if the King wanted the prince to do even more, he could just give the Crown Prince more powers without abdicating. Further, the Crown Prince can get a \"get out of jail free\" card by the King abdicating after a disaster and handing over to the Crown Prince, as long as the Crown Prince isn't too complicit, in which case nothing lost. But the thing that convinced me is there is no historical precedent for abdication other than down the barrel of a gun. There is no obvious threat of coups, or revolutions, political resistance or constitutional crisis. Nor is abdication common in the region at large. So the chances of abdication are almost zero. It is possible there was a long-standing plan to groom the crown prince for being King and it just so happens to happen between now and December. But even if that was the plan, the probability of the abdication happening then is still low, as it's just 2 months and a week. But the clincher, as per the article, is that no deputy crown prince has been appointed yet, which seems to be an urgent requirement for a planned handover. I'll go with 1% for abdication, which I add to the 2% chance of death.\nThe probability of The Crown Prince being fired is zero, because the King loves him and despite the anger by the West about the killing of a single journalist, those in the region barely bat an eyelid. And if he was going to be fird, he would have been fired long ago. Nor does it seem him not being made a king is likely. The Crown Prince has far too much power for rivals to have a serious chance. Weaknesses: I am very reliant on just one report from the Brookings institute. But I have a job to do too, so can't do everything.  That being said, the Brookings institute is \"ranked as the first-most influential and first in credibility among 27 think tanks considered. Yet \"Brookings and its researchers are not so concerned, in their work, in affecting the ideological direction of the nation\" and rather tend \"to be staffed by researchers with strong academic credentials\". So it is about as strong a source as you can get. Politically independent and expert.  Further the author is Bruce Riedel. He has prolific experience and expertise on these things frequently required at the very highest levels. So if he is good enough for both the PM of the UK and the President of the US, he's good enough for me. His closeness to Barak Obama gives me some pause, given Obama's insane and terrible foreign policy ideas. However, these policies seem mostly Obama's personally, and I see no sign Bruce Riedel \"bought\" Obama's \"strategic patience\" nonsense. So I have no reason to doubt his word. It's about one of the best views on this it is possible to get. Caveat: Western experts in the Middle East tend to be way out in terms of understanding that region. But this article seems sensible, and none of the regional quirks that send so many Western experts down the wrong direction seem to apply for this question.

What King Salman really wanted was for his own son, MBS, to carry on the throne.\nIn June 2017, Nayef gave up his claim to the throne to his cousin, MBS, who had just turned 31. Since then, MBS has ruthlessly tried to eliminate all his domestic threats to consolidate power. Which he has achieved very successfully.  On 31 Jul 2020 King Salman left the hospital after a 10-day stay where the 84-year-old underwent surgery to remove his gall bladder [1]. It was not life-threatening but his deteriorating health will undoubtedly hamper his ability to be King, even if that just means a few public appearances.  MBS may want to become King before the November election due to his relatively good relationship with the Trump administration compared to a future Biden one, giving his 'promotion' more legitimacy. (amongst several criticisms, Biden promised to end the sale of US weapons to Saudi Arabia for its war in Yemen). However, he is already the King in every way apart from name. Becoming King will not change much for him and he may want to wait until the death or abdication of his father out of respect. If his father chooses when he abdicates, it could happen next week or in 2023. But, his health and age mean it will probably be sooner rather than later. Seems very possible before 1 Dec due to the US elections and his fathers health. A situation where the answer is 'Yes, without becoming the King of Saudi Arabia' is very unlikely.
