By May 1st, the reality and gravity of the situation will have become more apparent, in the form of more (and stricter) lockdowns, and number of reported casualties. This will fuel erratic markets, maintaining a high VIX. (There is a possibility that the gravity of the situation, and its economic consequences, could completely paralyze the markets and reduce the VIX. There is also a possibility that trading might be suspended, which would also reduce the VIX. I believe those possiblities are unlikely to happen, based on the widespread belief in the power of \"The Market.\")"], [85001, "2020-03-26T23:40:44Z", [0.0], ""], [86726, "2020-03-26T23:18:57Z", [0.15], ""], [86726, "2020-03-26T23:17:50Z", [0.45], ""], [11817, "2020-03-26T22:46:05Z", [0.0], ""], [80764, "2020-03-26T21:05:23Z", [0.02], ""], [9576, "2020-03-26T19:28:29Z", [0.2], ""], [82587, "2020-03-26T18:51:31Z", [0.55], ""], [86690, "2020-03-26T12:39:41Z", [0.25], ""], [86513, "2020-03-26T10:46:30Z", [0.02], ""], [18322, "2020-03-26T09:31:02Z", [0.02], ""], [86700, "2020-03-26T08:45:39Z", [1.0], ""], [54962, "2020-03-26T08:26:37Z", [0.1], ""], [54962, "2020-03-26T08:25:34Z", [0.01], "Comment deleted on Mar 26, 2020 08:27AM UTC"], [59881, "2020-03-26T08:14:06Z", [0.6], ""], [86696, "2020-03-26T05:18:27Z", [0.25], ""], [86690, "2020-03-26T02:07:39Z", [0.25], ""], [86687, "2020-03-26T00:47:15Z", [0.2], ""], [691, "2020-03-25T13:16:24Z", [0.01], ""], [36105, "2020-03-25T03:56:39Z", [0.31], ""], [75863, "2020-03-24T22:19:46Z", [0.02], ""], [1474, "2020-03-24T18:19:58Z", [0.02], ""], [58851, "2020-03-24T16:46:13Z", [1.0], ""], [84645, "2020-03-24T15:53:46Z", [0.04], ""], [36105, "2020-03-24T13:55:51Z", [0.3], ""], [81287, "2020-03-24T11:56:13Z", [0.04], ""], [67844, "2020-03-24T07:33:34Z", [0.01], ""], [86615, "2020-03-24T07:14:51Z", [0.05], ""], [6709, "2020-03-24T06:09:28Z", [0.1], "Too soon for the Coronavirus to dissipate and the Markets to recover to that degree"], [79042, "2020-03-24T05:13:59Z", [0.74], ""], [1450, "2020-03-24T02:50:08Z", [0.21], ""], [11817, "2020-03-24T02:45:34Z", [0.0], ""], [86613, "2020-03-24T02:26:07Z", [0.1], "The number of cases in the US is still exponentially increasing.

Before the market opened on 20 Feb, news about the spread/lethality COVID-19 around the world began to create warning alarms in the news [2]. Today, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin stated that the US government would re-assess the impact of the fiscal stimulus in the next 10-12 weeks [3], which means that the government is planning to issue a second stimulus due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the market is pricing the VIX between 55.00 and 65.00 based on option chain analysis [4]. Additionally, many analysts are anticipating skyrocketing unemployment throughout the 2nd quarter with a possible spike up to 2 million claims across the country. During the last economic crisis, the CBOE VIX did not drop below 15.00 for the entirety of 2008 [1] and some economic leaders believe the economic impacts of COVID-19 could be worse/more volatile than the impacts of the 2008 economic crisis [6].  Thus, I assess a 2% chance that the CBOE VIX will fall below 15.00 before 1 May 2020.
