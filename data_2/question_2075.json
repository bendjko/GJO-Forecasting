For Brazil, it seems as if their rate has almost quadratically increased, which is close to the structure at the beginning of the logistic curve. A logistic curve is generally used to model the spread of a disease (see SIR models), and seems reasonable here since although there is an acceleration of vaccines at the beginning, but will slow down near the end due to less people available to vaccinate, and the accessibility issues.  A good baseline to start with is how long it took for Brazil to vaccinate 93M people because that is roughly the same percentage of people vaccinated as if India were to vaccinate 600M people. This took 155 days according to: https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/brazil/. If we were to look at 155 days after the first time India truly started administering vaccines at a widespread level, it would be around mid-September. Now to change this baseline, we have to think about factors specific to India. First, if we look at the the graph of **percentage of population** vaccinated, it is much slower than Brazil. If we adjust for this, it ends up being more mid-October. Furthermore, there are news of supply shortages of vaccines and concerns related to this have also pushed projections even lower. I hinge the probability of only 30% of the population getting vaccinated per this link: (https://scroll.in/latest/995465/covid-india-will-vaccinate-only-33-of-population-by-end-of-2021-in-current-scenario-predicts-imf) on the probability that the 5 vaccines that are yet to be approved are actually approved to be administered in India.
