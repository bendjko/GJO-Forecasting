Specifically, Fan BingBing was a public figure that broke Chinese law and dissapeared from public view for 3 months in 2018, and did not make a public appearance until April, 2019 [1]. Mr. Ma's trajectory seems to be following a similar flight path as he dissapeared from the public eye in October of 2020, and just released a video earlier this month [2]. Both Ms. Bingbing and Mr. Ma flaunted the Chinese communist party and, essentially embarrassed party leadership by coming across as being more powerful than the institution [3]. The Chinese communist party seems to have protocols in place that include public disappearance, followed by a video appearance, and finally public appearances and the the time span seems to encompass multiple months. Since Mr. Ma only just released a public video, it seems unlikely that he will make any public appearance any time soon, let alone outside of the PRC. This does not take into account the additional travel restrictions imposed by COVID-19 but that will, likely, also contribute to a lack of travel for Mr. Ma. Thus, I predict a 0% probability that Mr. Ma will make a physical appearance outside of the PRC before 1 April 2021.

Jack Ma may have his financially powerful company broken up and become a non-person and disappear from public life and certainly be contained within the borders of China.
