The CDC reports that the US is at approximately 123 million fully vaccinated as of 5/16, with 15 days to go. The 123 million for the 16th will bump up a bit once delayed reports come in. Even ignoring those delayed reports, we only need 17 million more fully vaccinated people to hit Bin D. That's an average of roughly 1.13 million per day for the remainder of the month. It's tough to see how the average drops that quickly, especially with new incentive programs for vaccinations (https://theconversation.com/beer-doughnuts-and-a-1-million-lottery-how-vaccine-incentives-and-other-behavioral-tools-can-help-the-us-reach-herd-immunity-160591) and efforts to make getting a vaccine more convenient (e.g., https://www.expressnews.com/news/local/article/Officials-want-to-make-it-easier-for-you-to-get-16181404.php). These programs are especially important for getting second doses into the arms of the roughly 34 million people who already have taken a first dose but have yet to complete the program. They already showed willingness to be vaccinated; we simply have to make it worth their while to take the time out for dose 2.

As of the same date, a little over 152M had received at least one dose. This figure, plus any one-dose J&J vaccinations occurring through the remainder of May, represents something close to the theoretical maximum of people who could be fully vaccinated by the end of the month, given the minimum three-week lag between 1st & 2nd doses for Pfizer & Moderna. With the J&J vaccine just coming off the recommended pause and the obvious hesitancy of people to resume taking that vaccine, it seems nearly impossible for the # of fully vaccinated to exceed 160M at the end of May. My initial assumption is that the average daily rate of fully vaccinated individuals for the 25 days after May 6th will be between 1 and 1.4M. The 7-day rolling average of daily new \"fully vaccinated individuals\" as of May 6th was a little over 1.3M; however, the trend was somewhat downward. That trend should have been based almost entirely on new Pfizer & Moderna fully vaccinated individuals given the J&J pause. My base case is that the resumption of J&J vaccinations will be roughly enough to offset the downward trend for 2nd doses of Pfizer & J&J, making the 140-150M bin overwhelmingly the most likely outcome. I'll now review the crowd data to see whether I want to adjust this initial forecast. After that, I'll be watching the trend data closely over the next week to refine my estimate of the average daily number of new fully vaccinated individuals.

Current considerations are number of people with first dose already because we only have time for more Pfizer 2-dose vaccinations and the J&J single-dose fully vaccinated. We must also consider the number of people who are vaccine hesitant or will refuse a vaccine because this decreases your ability to get fully vaccinated people when these appointments are going unfilled. I'll be using the current 5/4/21 number at 108,780,169 as a reasonable starting point so 27 days remaining gives us averages of:\n415,555 per day average for 120M\n785,925 per day for 130M\n1,156,296 per day for 140M\n1,526,666 per day for 150M I'll stop there because the current 7-day moving average on the CDC's website is at 1,318,000 with little indication that it will move back toward the peak, so in my opinion 150,000,000 or more is definitely out as a possibility. Clearly we should also hit the 120M mark at a minimum because that should happen in the next 10 days at current pace. So we are down to only two threshold questions - will we hit 130M and will we hit 140M? The answer depends on how sharply numbers fall - as fewer people can be vaccinated we have a natural lengthening of time between vaccinations because people's schedules interfere and they feel it is less urgent to get vaccinated since others already are vaccinated. This is fighting against the potential boost from the J&J single-jab vaccine and the government distributing the vaccine to local pharmacies since people trust those more than the hospitals. I'm pretty skeptical Americans actually know what is best for themselves - especially with all the misinformation surrounding COVID (we're still losing over 700 people per day). Looking at the 1,282,773 7-day average from 5/1/21 I have very little faith we will maintain that number above 1,156,296 for the remainder of this month. I'll give it a nod just in case some miracle happens, but I'm much more confident in the lower numbers but not too low.\n"], [55987, "2021-05-07T15:38:09Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.53, 0.47, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [97140, "2021-05-07T14:06:04Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [99496, "2021-05-07T13:06:38Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.6, 0.2], ""], [73970, "2021-05-07T09:54:37Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.92, 0.08, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [20156, "2021-05-07T08:37:16Z", [0.0, 0.27, 0.52, 0.21, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [80790, "2021-05-06T21:45:25Z", [0.0, 0.12, 0.81, 0.07, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "Following on from yesterday, I think having read up on why vaccinations are dropping (links in comment on the one or more dose question) the rate will still keep dropping, but not as fast as 1st doses.

(It was a little under a month in March, but almost exactly 30 days right now.) I also agree with him that the J&J vaccine isn't moving much, and that its effects are likely to be pretty negligible on the forecast total. I include 3 days for back reporting. So, I'm looking to forecast the total reported on June 3. So, if I allow 30 days for people to get a second shot, then the number of people who have had at at least one dose on May 4 (today), 148.6M, should be about the number of people who are fully vaccinated on June 3. By then, though, it might take 31 or 32 days for the same number of people who have had at least one shot to get a second. So this should be a rough upper limit. Looking at it from another angle: 9.5M people added to the total in the past week, or 1.36M/day. If we continue to add 1.36M/day for the next 29 days, we'd get to 107.3M (total today) + 39.4M = 146.7M. I would think this would be an upper limit, as vaccination slows down. 146.7M and 148.6M are thankfully in the higher middle region of the 140M to 150M forecast bin, and I'll be going largely with that one, with a little weight on the lower bin in case a slightly larger fraction of the current population, which is overall less interested in getting vaccinated, decides not to get a second dose. That would require going down to adding an average of 1.13M people/day, which seems very unlikely to me. Also, I'm trying to restrain myself from making 100% forecasts in the beginning, even if I'm 100% certain... at that moment, lol. Update 5/8: 112.6M reported fully vaccinated as of today. 103.4M as of May 1. 9.2M added in 1 week, or 1.31M/day. (93.1M as of Apr 24; 10.3M added that week, or 1.47M/day.) 31 days left in forecast period (allowing 3 days for back reporting). Doses administered are falling every week (by 0.16M/day/week from 2 weeks ago to 1 week ago), so total might be something like 112.6M + 7 * (1.15M + 0.99M + 0.83M + 0.67M) + 3 * .65 = 140.0M.
