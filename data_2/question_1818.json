It's worth noting GOOD design and development should involve testing, but it would appear that in this case funds are specifically requested for testing, so it's hard to tell if this is a smoking gun there's only 1 test coming until FY2022, or if it's just written lazily because only the authors and a handful of key stakeholders will read it. I can't bring myself to shift heavier against the crowd at this stage, but will keep an eye out for other sources which may shed light on this question.  1. https://news.usni.org/2021/07/20/report-to-congress-on-conventional-prompt-global-strike-and-long-range-ballistic-missiles-4\n2. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year#United_States"], [94872, "2021-07-20T05:47:32Z", [0.0, 0.19, 0.23, 0.48, 0.1], ""], [1333, "2021-07-17T15:03:44Z", [0.01, 0.02, 0.1, 0.86, 0.01], ""], [691, "2021-07-16T17:06:32Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.84, 0.08], ""], [94563, "2021-07-15T15:34:23Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.25, 0.6, 0.1], ""], [94872, "2021-07-15T01:19:59Z", [0.0, 0.17, 0.21, 0.44, 0.18], ""], [101926, "2021-07-14T22:16:00Z", [0.6, 0.4, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [101902, "2021-07-13T19:59:24Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.9, 0.05], ""], [691, "2021-07-09T15:51:27Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.07, 0.86, 0.07], ""], [1333, "2021-07-09T13:27:16Z", [0.01, 0.02, 0.09, 0.87, 0.01], ""], [94872, "2021-07-08T04:46:47Z", [0.0, 0.17, 0.21, 0.44, 0.18], ""], [40584, "2021-07-08T01:10:46Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.12, 0.47, 0.31], "This question poses some questions.

The Navy announced that they tested the first stage of the Solid Rocket Motor (SRM) which will be used with the hypersonic glide body. But the release definitely makes it sound like this is distinct from the hypersonic glide body itself, and also the release says the following: \"This successful SRM test represents a critical milestone leading up to the next Navy and Army joint flight test, which will take place in the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2022, and ultimately the fielding of the CPS and LRHW weapon systems.\" Previous information had said there would be 3 tests this year, the first in the third quarter of FY 2021, which for the US government means April through June (the FY starts in October). So I'm wondering if this motor test was the first one they're talking about? Or maybe their schedule slipped? Or maybe the test is still happening soon and I'm just not seeing any reporting on it. Either way, I'm a lot less certain in 3 tests this year.

To meet the schedule, each test will have meet multiple objectives which increases the complexity of the subsequent flight tests.

There is 1 case with all 3 tests fail, 3 cases for one successful test, 3 cases for 2 successful tests and 1 for 3 successful tests, out of 8 possible outcome combinations.  Therefore the probabilities for 0, 1, 2 and 3 successful tests are 12.5, 37.5, 37.5 and 12.5%, respectively. Inside view:\nHistorically complex weapon systems frequently have encountered significant delays and over the budget.  I don't see how this particular case is any different. Since the planned number of tests is 3 for 2021, it is very unlikely that >3 tests will happen, let alone >3 successful tests.  0% for the >3 basket.   There has been one successful flight test in March 2020 already [1]. It is very likely that at least one  \"successful\" (as defined in this question, which has a low bar) test will happen in 2021.  I put 0% in the first basket (zero successful test). I would increase the probability for 1 successful test to from a base rate of 37.5% to 50%, 2 successful tests to 40%, but reduce the 3 successful tests to 10%.  The adjustments are attempts to account for the increasing difficulties in achieving the DoD goals in subsequent tests (and not whether the glide body reaches its designated impact point alone).  The third test might not even happen in the time frame of this question due to unforeseeable technical difficulties.
