The main one being the correlation between people who think they can predict the future and people who are crypto-zealots. Thus, I would take the crowd estimate as an an unrealistic ceiling and heavily discount that signal even before doing the following  fundamental analysis: SEC has good reason to be concerned about the crimes enabled by BTC and the price manipulation of BTC that's going on currently, as well as the inherent volatility. For these reasons the chances of a BTC-only ETF are very slim. OTOH, SEC wants to have more oversight and control over the crypto markets so there's a chance they would use a BTC ETF as a wedge into it. However, the new Chair has said he's prioritizing ETFs on BTC futures already regulated on the CME (https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/new-sec-chairman-gives-his-first-speech-2149304/) which makes sense as their solution to get a wedge into the market, as then the SEC would not be responsible for investigating fraud and such in the underlying BTC market, which is impossible to do anyway. Finally, the SEC has a history of taking many years to make regulations and to approve applications on new technologies, for instance see the state of the crowdfunding regulations nearly a decade after the JOBS Act required the SEC to regulate.  From the SEC's standpoint, time is their friend; if BTC implodes or otherwise loses market dominance to the hordes of other cryptos nipping its heals, then the SEC's caution will be vindicated. On the flipside, if the approve an ETF and either of these things happens, they will look bad and so there's no actual upside of approving a BTC-only ETF.

This kind of volatility and subjective valuation is not a product that I believe should be sold to average Americans who do not understand that they may as well be playing black jack; Imagine a novice investor who spent his quarantine getting a BS degree in YouTube finance cashing out his Roth-IRA MF holdings so as to jump on BTC or Dogecoin - is that not cringeworthy enough of an image to see why broadening access to exposure of BTC  could end poorly, and quickly? \"Put everything on BTC/Doge\" sounds very similar to \"Put everything on black\" as even after a \"winning hand\" you are exposed to BTC volatility as long as you hold it, almost in the same way you are when holding your winning chips on a casino floor - and the casino quite literally banks on you prolonging that risk. That is not value investing, that is gambling, and I find it to be immoral how anyone with any fiduciary responsibility and ethical sense about them would call it anything but a gamble.
