However, the murders are being performed by many different groups, no one of which is likely to hit 1,000.   It will come down to the scorers:  Either each separate police and military agency is a different \"armed group,\" or together they are an \"armed group\" of Duterte's minions even though they wear different uniforms.   Depends, I guess, on what the Early Warning People intend to issue warnings about.  If it's systematic mass murders encouraged by an identifiable leadership group, the Philippines will hit 1,000 every couple of months; if it requires a single organization to do the killing, the Rwanda genocide wouldn't have counted.  Similar situations prevail in Nigeria and a couple of other countries.
