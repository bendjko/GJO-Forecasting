I looked at past data, adjusted for recent trends and ended up at the wrong end of the spectrum here. For much of the duration of this question I had 0 or near zero in the 6+ bucket. That's not surprising because 6+ had never happened before. Through mid September it seemed like it was going in the direction I predicted, but towards the end of the season a whole series of big storms sprang up. One observation that was interesting to me is that since about mid September the forecasts have consistently underestimated the severity and speed of development of the storms. The ensemble models have consistently seen a rate of storm development that was outside the range of any of the components. By a lot.  That suggests to me that the Atlantic basin hurricane models may need some tweaking to reflect current climatic conditions.  @cafebedouin"], [1333, "2020-11-16T15:27:59Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "Iota is a CAT IV this morning.\n"], [529, "2020-11-16T15:13:49Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [6978, "2020-11-16T15:12:30Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [88010, "2020-11-16T15:12:03Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [88010, "2020-11-16T15:11:52Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [88010, "2020-11-16T14:33:50Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [43189, "2020-11-16T14:33:40Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT1+shtml/161143.shtml?"], [88010, "2020-11-16T14:33:31Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [87897, "2020-11-16T14:32:08Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [88560, "2020-11-16T14:29:18Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [83, "2020-11-16T14:17:10Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [96935, "2020-11-16T13:57:01Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [68294, "2020-11-16T13:43:09Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "Done, thanks @Daveinsea for the reply"], [86658, "2020-11-16T13:31:05Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.3, 0.7], ""], [75363, "2020-11-16T13:17:23Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [88743, "2020-11-16T10:34:57Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [60948, "2020-11-16T07:22:43Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [60948, "2020-11-16T07:18:29Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [88010, "2020-11-16T04:22:50Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [88010, "2020-11-16T04:22:38Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [88010, "2020-11-16T04:22:22Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.98], ""], [68294, "2020-11-16T03:13:34Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.92], "Adjusting again.

The hurricane season for 2020 in the Atlantic runs from June 1 to November 30 while the Eastern Pacific hurricane season runs from May 15th to November 30th. The Atlantic basin includes the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has never forecast 25 storms in a single season, typically only producing 12 named storms in a season. Conditions are more conducive to such storms as water temperature and wind shear as key indicators in predicting the strength of a hurricane season. Both of which are higher than average this year. The amount of available moisture\u00a0versus the volume of disruptive winds is also a primary indicator.\u00a0\n\tAs of 10/7, 25 storms have already been named, with 53 days left in the season. Eight hurricanes have developed this season with three upgrading to a major storm. The three major storms were Laura, Teddy, and Delta. Laura tied the 1856 Last Island hurricane in being the most powerful storm to hit the state of Louisiana.  Nine named storms have made landfall within the continental United States. The Greek letter system, resurrected this year, has only been used one other time in 2005. Hurricane Hanna, Isaias, Laura, and Marco have struct the coast in varying degrees, one developing to a category four storm. Total damage is placed over $24 billion with nearly 145 fatalities. Models show that mid-September to November is typically the apex of hurricane activity. Therefore, the season is slowly winding down yet still has the potential to produce another major storm. Thus, three to four major hurricanes will likely occur resulting in a total of four to five major hurricanes for this the entire season, one of the most active on record.\u00a0\n\u2028\nSources\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2020/05/11/us/2020-atlantic-hurricane-season-fast-facts/index.html\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2020/08/06/weather/noaa-2020-hurricane-forecast-revision/index.html\nhttps://www.nhc.noaa.gov/climo/\nhttps://www.accuweather.com/en/hurricane/record-setting-atlantic-hurricane-season-kicking-into-overdrive/810794\nhttps://www.nhc.noaa.gov/\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/hurricane-season-is-so-bad-that-we-are-running-out-of-names-11599841440\nhttps://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutsshws.php\nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/08/21/florida-gulf-hurricanes-nhc-forecasts-two-tropical-depressions/3406310001/\n"], [88743, "2020-10-08T20:03:34Z", [0.0, 0.22, 0.44, 0.25, 0.09], ""], [38094, "2020-10-08T19:46:31Z", [0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0], "Climbing on the fence, it's not over yet."], [95292, "2020-10-08T18:11:15Z", [0.15, 0.7, 0.15, 0.0, 0.0], "I believe my predictions for the number of major hurricanes in the Atlantic to be accurate.

The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 through November 30\u2026 NOAA\u2019s Climate Prediction Center is forecasting a likely range of 13 to 19 named storms (winds of 39 mph or higher), of which 6 to 10 could become hurricanes (winds of 74 mph or higher), including 3 to 6 major hurricanes (category 3, 4 or 5; with winds of 111 mph or higher). NOAA provides these ranges with a 70% confidence. An average hurricane season produces 12 named storms, of which 6 become hurricanes, including 3 major hurricanes.\u201d (NOAA, 2020) Three major hurricanes a year is the average hurricane season.  NOAA predicts 3-6 major hurricanes.  However, as of 30 September, while the number of named storms is above average at 23, there have only been eight hurricanes, two of which were major (Laura and Teddy), and one of these (Teddy) never made landfall in the U.S. (Scott, 2020). In order for there to be an \u201cabove average\u201d year, two more major hurricanes would have to form between now and 30 November. What is the likelihood that this occurs?  What is the probability of major hurricanes forming in October and November? \u201cFrom mid-August through mid-October, the activity spikes, accounting for 78 percent of the tropical storm days, 87 percent of the category 1 and 2 hurricane days (Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale), and a whopping 96 percent of the major (category 3, 4 and 5) hurricane days.\u201d (NOAA, 2016) In other words, the most dangerous period for forming major hurricanes will be over in 12 days, after which major hurricane activity becomes extremely unlikely. In fact, it is likely that if a next major hurricane occurs in this period, it is currently being tracked as a tropical storm or a tropical depression. There are two storms currently in the Atlantic.  Neither of these are likely to become anything stronger than they already are.  The only other storm is north of Venezuela and has a 60% chance of cyclone formation and may very well become a tropical depression.  But it is already too close to land, and it is likely to run into Tropical Storm Gamma (which is moving southeast).  This may strengthen Tropical Storm Gamma, but it\u2019s only like to make Gamma a hurricane, not reach major hurricane status. Due to the lack of a qualifying candidate for major hurricane being present, and the end of the peak time for major hurricanes occurring on 15 October, I am forecasting with 80% confidence that this year\u2019s hurricane season will have only two major hurricanes, with 19% for three major hurricanes and a 1% chance of four or more major hurricanes.

This prediction is based off of established NOAA hurricane averages; that being 6.4 hurricanes and 2.7 major hurricanes per year. I predict a high likelihood of an above average number of major hurricanes due to ACE index trends (Accumulated Cyclone Energy). According to this index, both the 2018 and 2019 hurricane seasons had above average storm formation rates, leading me to predict approximately one more serious hurricane than the average of 2.7. With the Atlantic hurricane season ending on November 30th and one major hurricane having occurred as of this prediction, it is likely that there will be an above average amount of major hurricanes. I predict a 15% chance of 5 or more storms forming due to that being almost twice the NOAA average, and unlikely to occur.

We currently have 5 tropical cyclones are in the Atlantic at the same time, and this happened for only the second time in history. The last time it happened in the Atlantic was in 1971. However, there was only one major hurricane in this season. So the fact that we have 5 current cyclones now do not change our base rate much.  Right now, we already have one major hurricanes. Out of the five current ones, Teddy is forecast to become a major hurricane (Category 3 or higher). With the existing one major hurricane this year, we already have 2 major hurricanes up until 9/16/2020.  The question then becomes how many major hurricanes we will have since 9/16/20 this season. According to major mid-season forecasts, the experts seem to be forecasting around 11-16 named hurricanes and 3-6 major hurricanes.

Currently, there has been 1 hurricane, however the peak of the season is still ahead of us (month of September). It is currently predicted that this season will be above normal regarding hurricane activity with a probability of 85%. As pointed out by @dzhou3, the Colorado research report gives a very good insight into current hurricane predictions and they predict in total 5 hurricanes for this seasons (https://tropical.colostate.edu/Forecast/2020-08.pdf). The report also suggests that there is on average 2.6 major hurricanes (category 3 and above) per year and with a standard deviation of 1.94. Adjustments:\nSkew:\n@pchi pointed out correctly that there has been no season in recent history with more than (or equal) 4 hurricanes building after September 6. This would indicate that we should take back from our right skew as with the the likelihood of having many hurricanes very close to each other is being decreased.\nCurrent trends:\nWe are in the front half of the busiest month for hurricanes and the National Hurricane Center is not predicting any major hurricane building in the next 5 days (https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gtwo.php?basin=atlc&fdays=5). They put 10% and 30% formation probability of a cyclone in the Atlantic, and they have 1 Storm in the Eastern Pacific (Julio), but they put very low probability into it turning into a major hurricane. Forecast: In August 5, they put an 85% probability that there will be an above average activity of hurricanes. Given that there has been already one hurricane, we decrease our probability of first bucket to 9%. Given that there has been no precedence of seeing >= 4 hurricanes after September 6, we seriously decrease the probability of 6 or more hurricanes happening in aggregate. For 3-4-5 we cannot really build a differentiated opinion as it is still very early to have strong priors. We put the major bulk of probability into 4 as this would be around 1 standard deviation away from historical mean, underlining that this hurricane season was more active than previous seasons.

It's also relevant to recognize that the 2020 hurricane season is actually outpacing the very active 2005 season in terms of number of named storms (but not number of named hurricanes).  The latest NOAA update (August 6) is still predicting between 3-6 major hurricanes for the season this year. Considering we've only had 1 major hurricane to date, the upper bound of this range seems rather high. The 2005 hurricane season had a total of 7 major hurricanes, 5 of which had formed by September 5. The 2004 hurricane season, which was also quite active, had a total of 6 major hurricanes, 3 of which had formed by September 5.  On the contrary, the 2017 hurricane season is worth mentioning, with a total of 6 major hurricanes, but \"only\" 2 major hurricanes by 9/5. Generally speaking the development of major hurricanes is independent, and a lack of major hurricanes at the beginning of the season doesn't mean a lack of major hurricanes at the end, and vice versa. The 2005 and 2017 seasons both serve as good examples. In order to get a better of the current season, there are no current active systems but there are two \"Invests\" (potential systems) with one given a high probability of developing into a named storm. This invest is a \"cape verde\" which is where most long-range major categories typically develop from in the second half of the season so is certainly something to consider.  Preliminary forecast is given above, with most weight given on 4 and 5 as looking from historical data there have been ~3 major hurricanes following the halfway point in active seasons. I give the >=6 bucket less weight because that would mean 5 major hurricanes in the remainder of the season, which would be quite extreme considering that most of the activity will be occurring in the next month and half.

Once arrived at the Florida keys, it is likely to strengthen over the very warm gulf surface, and to organize into a Hurricane of category 1 or 2 at least, making landfall somewhere between Louisiana and Florida panhandle before 28 August 2020.

I am more optimistic that the coming season will be less severe than some have suggested. Both my regression models and an aggregate of expert opinion seem to indicate that this season will bring a fair number of hurricanes. However, I think that the crowd's prediction that there is a 30% chance of 5 hurricanes and only a 1% chance of 2 or less is too pessimistic. Since there are no hurricanes developing as of 14/06 I fail to see why these predictions could be so high. That being said, the forecast does look odious and Atlantic sea temperatures are warmer than normal so I have tweaked my predictions upwards a little to account for this. I have outlined how I generated my predictions below. The first part of my prediction (40%) used a Linear Regression model to project the number of Cat. 3 hurricanes in 2020. The model uses data from 1969 to 2019 and tries to account for growth across the time period. Essentially, it uses a line of \u2018best-fit\u2019 to make a prediction for 2020. The model predicts that there will be 3.664 category 3 hurricanes in 2020 and I used a normal distribution formula to work out probabilities for each bin. I got the 1969-2019 data from Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane_season) Linear Regression Predictions: 2 or Fewer = 36%\n3 = 23%\n4 = 20%\n5 = 13%\n6 or More = 9% The second part of my model (40%) uses the average prediction by experts and institutions from around the world. Rather surprisingly the average prediction comes in only slightly higher than the linear regression model at 3.8 cat. 3 hurricanes. It is worth noting that of the 11 forecasts l looked at only 2 studies predicted more than 4 major hurricanes in the coming season. Again, I used a normal distribution formula to generate probabilities for each bin. It is likely that the experts will use different methods to generate probability distributions but I only had access to hurricane number predictions and therefore had to generate probabilities using my own methods. Source (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Atlantic_hurricane_season). Average of Expert Predictions (11 Institutions from around the world including the NOAA and the Met Office): 2 or Fewer = 32%\n3 = 22%\n4 = 21%\n5 = 14%\n6 or More = 10% It is interesting to compare the expert predictions to the best-fit projections I made in part one. As you can see, the aggregate expert prediction is not too far removed from the \u2018mean regression\u2019 prediction I made above. I think in some respects the seemingly over-pessimistic forecasts by the crowd may be due to too much focus on the NOAA prediction and fear inducing articles such as this - https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/14/weather/hurricane-season-2020-records-forecast-june/index.html. I may be wrong, but the crowd's prediction that there is only a 1% chance of 2 or fewer cat. 3 hurricanes seems extreme and contrasts with recent history (Even if you take the last 21 years, there have been 2 or less hurricanes on eight occasions). The final part of my model (20%) uses a simple base rate for each bin over the last 21 years. This is a simple count of the occurrences of each bin over the last 21 years. Base Rate Probabilities: 2 or Fewer = 45%\n3 = 15%\n4 = 15%\n5 = 15%\n6 or More = 10%\n"], [89379, "2020-06-15T04:18:12Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.9], "Basing it on previous years and trends."], [88209, "2020-06-15T03:49:39Z", [0.0, 0.06, 0.49, 0.43, 0.02], ""], [89785, "2020-06-15T01:42:50Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5], "An average year produces 5 hurricanes a season.

I assume that early on a lot of major hurricanes were missed because they were minor hurricanes when they hit land or they never hit land.
