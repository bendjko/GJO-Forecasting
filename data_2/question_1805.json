The Oliver Wyman pandemic navigator has the cases at about 2200 by December 1: https://pandemicnavigator.oliverwyman.com/forecast?mode=counties&region=US_US-NY_005&panel=baseline All of this would basically skew the probabilities to something like 80%. The thing that is tempering it down a bit for me is (a) not understanding the recent (albeit small) downtick in NYC; (b) some potential funkiness regarding testing and total number of cases around thanksgiving.
