Both artists had a breakout year, with appearances on Saturday Night Live (no other artists on the list appeared in the latest season). Lizzo was selected as the musical guest for a historic episode, marking Eddie Murphy's return in 35 years. Also, both present an alternative image of femalehood gaining rise in modern media. Bon Iver scores high due to an established, successful career, and emotionally charged melody of \"Hey Ma.\" Though not as mainstream, images of Beck's 2015 surprise 7 Grammy ninja attack come to mind. Lil Nas X had a successful year in crossover history, scoring high in Hip Hop, Pop, and winning a CMA for Musical Event of the Year. That said, the odds appear likely \"Old Town Road\" will be his biggest hit. Khalid's sophomore album in 2019 showed the growth of this artist, nominated the previous year for \"Best New Artist.\" Though \"Talk\" is an amazing record, I would not say his exposure has been broad enough to garner the top award. This is the same for Post Malone and Swae Lee. Despite international popularity, Ariana Grande's 7 Rings fails to showcase her vocal talents or live up to past hits. H.E.R. scores lowest, as she is still very new.
