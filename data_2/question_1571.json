Esto utilizando los datos totales del pa\u00eds y su evoluci\u00f3n a medida que pasa el tiempo. Tras 27 d\u00edas de confinamiento, van al rededor de 16000 muertos en dicho pa\u00eds.  Esta predicci\u00f3n se basa en t\u00e9rminos ambientales y sanitarios de la regi\u00f3n en la que se encuentra el pa\u00eds. Los \u00faltimos d\u00edas las cifras de muertos en dicho pa\u00eds han disminuido de pasar de cerca de 900 muertos diarios en su peak a 605 el d\u00eda reci\u00e9n pasado. Esta baja lleva ya algunos d\u00edas, por lo que algunas predicciones se pueden hacer. Considerando que en Europa el invierno ya esta alejandose y los climas de ac\u00e1 al 1 de mayo comenzaran a ser bastante m\u00e1s c\u00e1lidos, dan para pensar que estos contagios disminuir\u00e1n, ya que las defensas de las personas vuelven a subir disminuyendo resfrios e infecciones contagiosas. Es por el \u00e9poca del a\u00f1o que ocurri\u00f3 todo en Europa una de las razones de esta explosividad de contagios, ya que los agarr\u00f3 en pleno invierno, \u00e9poca m\u00e1s critica para enfermedades pulmonares sobre todo para adultos mayores.  Tras ver los datos, se puede ver que los muertos por d\u00eda han ido bajando. Esto se relaci\u00f3n en gran medida con el clima y el sin fin  de medidas que se han ido adoptando en t\u00e9rminos de santifizaci\u00f3n, trabajos, escuelas, etc. Es por esto que ya con la gente preparada y al tanto del tema, que predigo que en los pr\u00f3ximos 21 d\u00edas habr\u00e1n entre 9 y 12 mil muertos m\u00e1s, con un promedio de entre 450 a 600 muertos diarios. A la fecha se va con un promedio de casi 700 muertos diarios pero considerando las primeras semanas donde el virus reci\u00e9n brotaba y la cifra de muertos era mucho menor.  Esto generar\u00e1 un tipo de campana de gauss, haciendo que a medida que nos acercamos al verano Europeo los contagios comiencen a bajar. 25% restante de la predicci\u00f3n es producto de lo impredecible del virus y su mutaci\u00f3n, ya que nadie sabe como se puede seguir comportando. Existe la opci\u00f3n de que ocurra lo de Jap\u00f3n, donde luego de mejoras gigantes, se tuvo que volver al estado de emergencia. Lo mismo podr\u00eda ocurrir en cualquier otro pais.  Es por estas razones que mi predicci\u00f3n de Espa\u00f1a es que tender\u00e1 a ir a la baja en cantidad de muertos diarios, ya que su peak m\u00e1s alto esta siendo dejado atr\u00e1s. No significa que esta pandemia se acabe en este pa\u00eds, ya que falta la etapa de baja, luego la de manutenci\u00f3n y un buen  tiempo esperando si existe o no un re brote de la pandemia.
