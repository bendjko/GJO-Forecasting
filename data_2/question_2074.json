If the daily rate of COVID-19 remains the same through 12 November 2021 that will add an additional 458,080 cases to the count. To reach a total caseload of 22 million, there will need to be 483,033 additional cases. Even though the rate of daily cases is decreasing, it will be cutting it close to the 22 million mark.

In order to pass the benchmark of 24,000,000 and reach the next level of prediction, the average number of daily cases would have to immediately increase to 70,498, an increase of 53,724 (420%) and maintain that level throughout the next month. Based on this information, I would place my confidence at \n90% that the number remains between 22 and 24 million with a 10% holdout that it could remain below 22 million if Brazil undertakes and sustains a sufficient level of transmission management.. It is far more likely that the number of new daily cases plateaus or even reduces, which is why I have assigned the small possibility (10%) that the number will not reach 22 million. Analyzing data directly from the World Health Organization (WHO) seems to back up the conclusion that new cases, overall, have been decreasing week by week, with the highest rate of week-to-week growth being September 20th at 142, 028 cases (WHO, 2021). Although this also happens to be the highest single week growth rate going back to the start of the pandemic, this information further corroborates my assertion that the likeliest outcome is the number of coronavirus cases in Brazil reaching a level of at least 22 million but fewer than 24 million.

While the numbers again dropped off, there is still plenty of time left during the month of October for there to be yet another dramatic spike given the unpredictability of the virus in the shape of different and sudden variants. Also taken into consideration, is that people in Brazil may become complacent with a drop such as the one shown and disregard the short but sharp rise in mid-September and choose to spend more time with family or friends as a result. With this sudden exposure, there may be yet another spike to carry the numbers north of 22 million. There is also the issue of halting the use of China company SINOVAC\u2019s vaccine as health concerns grow over its use. Allegedly, a 16-year died as a result of the vaccination causing a panic. Whether or not local health officials will allow this to deter the use of what appears to be Brazil\u2019s only means to a vaccine or if public fears will sway those yet to receive the shot, remains uncertain. If this does cause a drop off to immunizations, then I believe that there will be an excess of 22 million cases in Brazil before or on 11/12. As for the 20% speculation that it will reach and or surpass 22million, there is always uncertainty. As of today, numbers show that cases are still dropping despite the sudden and high spike in September. So, if Brazil can manage to stay on its current trajectory while taking the necessary precautions and continued vaccinations then it may very well avoid eclipsing 22 million by 11/12."], [102931, "2021-10-10T19:45:31Z", [0.3, 0.7, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "As of 10/10/21, Brazil has 21,516,967 confirmed cases.

The WHO also reported that as of 1 October 2021, 225,795,545 vaccine doses have been administered. Although there was an increase in the number of confirmed cases from 7 October to 10 October, the daily confirmed cases should decrease with preventive measures and the number of vaccines administered. Therefore, the total confirmed cases of COVID-19 the WHO will report for Brazil as of 12 November 2021 would likely be between 22 million and 24 million, inclusive (75%) (low-moderate-confidence), more than 24 million but fewer than 26 million (23%) (low-confidence), and between 26 million and 28 million, inclusive (2%) (low-confidence).

Cases will depend on the ratio of vaccinated to unvaccinated Brazilians: greater vaccinations will reduce the rate of spread, and thus the rate of increase in confirmed cases. Yes there are some other political variables to consider, such as institutional trust. But I think this is a solid starting point.\u00a0 As of October 8, Brazil had 21.6 million confirmed cases and 72.5% of the population received at least one does, which is approximately 90% effective against transmission, so adjust that to 65.25%. Brazil has a total population of 212 million people. The CDC also estimates that true Covid numbers are at least\u00a06 times higher than confirmed cases. So approximately 125 million people (59% of the population) already have natural immunity, while 138 million (adjusted) have vaccinated immunity. Yet there is inevitably some overlap. I'm a little rusty on my probability calculations, but I think this would be P (A U B) --> P (62.5% U 59%) --> P =84.6% of the population with some form of immunity. That breaks down to approximately 178 million Brazilians with little to no chance of contracting Covid, leaving 34 million susceptible. Divide that by the original 6, which shows only about 560,000 more infections are likely to be confirmed.\u00a0 Of course reinfection sometimes occurs, and as testing continues to expand the ratio of detected/undetected cases will decrease. But this would more likely be in the long term. This sets an upper bound of about 22.2 million of total possible confirmed cases, leaving only two possible choices.\u00a0 If Brazil stays at its current average of about 15,000 cases a day, that puts the upper bound at 495,000 cases by Nov 12, right above the 22 million mark. While this is likely to decline as vaccinations and natural immunity increase, there is a diminishing rate of vaccinations- only a 1% increase over the past two weeks. This is likely to slow further as most who want the vaccine already got it. Thus new vaccinations probably won't be enough to bring the projection below the 22 million mark.\u00a0 But it will be close!\u00a0\n"], [89038, "2021-10-10T13:25:53Z", [0.2, 0.8, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [102913, "2021-10-10T02:38:00Z", [0.2, 0.8, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "Judging by the COVID rates from the past 24hrs, it does not seem likely the COVID cases will skyrocket past 26 million.

November 8 is exactly one month from today and at a significantly decreasing rate of reported contractions in a country of 212.6million (2020) people the total of confirmed is roughly 10% with first reporting numbers occurring March 16 of 2020, approximately 17months for 10% of the population and one month left to record and though underreporting is possible the population of Brazil is roughly 88%urban.  With 17months recorded exposure, 10% confirmed at 21.2million and an 88% urban population it is unlikely a massive increase will occur in the next month to impact the total number of cases, especially based on current regressions according to the WHO. The average weekly total increase for August and September was at 175,871.5 with an average .85% Weekly Rate of Change.

From 8/11 to 8/21, cases declined by 0.17k/day. At this rate of decline of the decline, cases should stop declining within ~2 weeks. At that point, the growth in Delta cases will balance out the decline in non-Delta cases. But because case levels are so high, we know that Delta cases will already be growing quickly, more quickly than non-Delta cases are falling. So we can expect cases to start growing very soon after cases stop falling, in contrast with the long plateaus seen in the UK and the US. And then we will see how fast a Delta wave grows and how big it gets in Brazil. There is huge uncertainty because we really don't know what levels of existing immunity there are, but I do think the Delta wave will be substantial. Here's an example of just how different Delta waves can be in individual communities because of different levels of previous spread: https://twitter.com/EricTopol/status/1429141726266990597 Broadening the forecast more between bins 2 and 3 because, looking at previous case data in Brazil, I am reminded that it can be very, very noisy. For example, suppose that cases stop growing around the end of August and start growing in early September, with just over 2 months left to the forecast. Case growth from similar levels last fall, around Nov. 12, added >4.5M in just over 2 months. Update 8/24: Brazil's CFR is 1.69x the US CFR, suggesting that 59% of the proportion of cases the US detects are detected in Brazil. Brazil's population is 64% of that of the US. So, 30k cases/day in Brazil would correspond to something like 28k cases/day in Brazil. The Delta wave in the US started when cases were ~12k/day. By the time cases were 28k/day (July 16), cases were increasing quickly. I think we can anticipate an upturn in cases within a week or so in Brazil. Cases will grow slowly for a while, as non Delta cases continue to fall, but case growth will then accelerate."], [34959, "2021-08-22T13:38:42Z", [0.05, 0.92, 0.03, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [99993, "2021-08-21T16:03:51Z", [0.07, 0.84, 0.09, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [62808, "2021-08-21T01:08:48Z", [0.0, 0.93, 0.07, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [55987, "2021-08-20T21:48:56Z", [0.02, 0.92, 0.06, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2021-08-20T17:48:06Z", [0.0, 0.91, 0.09, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [89038, "2021-08-20T12:59:58Z", [0.02, 0.86, 0.12, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [100653, "2021-08-20T06:27:03Z", [0.0, 0.6, 0.25, 0.05, 0.1], ""], [94872, "2021-08-20T05:13:02Z", [0.12, 0.77, 0.11, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [79142, "2021-08-19T21:55:36Z", [0.0, 0.96, 0.04, 0.0, 0.0], "Aug, 19 85 Days* today\u00b4s 7 days average (32000) = 23.136.000 / need 19000 or lower to be fewer than 22 milion\nAug, 10 94 Days* today\u00b4s 7 days average (34000) = 23.353.000 / need 19000 or lower to be fewer than 22 milion\n03AUG 101 Days * today\u00b4s 7 days average (39000) = 23.553.000\nToday\u00b4s trend - low\nDelta variant being detected\nWHO data has a 4 days delay"], [691, "2021-08-19T18:44:59Z", [0.0, 0.89, 0.11, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [34959, "2021-08-19T15:32:12Z", [0.05, 0.86, 0.09, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [99943, "2021-08-19T14:58:15Z", [0.0, 0.9, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0], "Basing Delta wave growth on the previous decline."], [99943, "2021-08-19T14:57:40Z", [0.0, 0.85, 0.15, 0.0, 0.0], "Cases/day declined from 55k on June 30 to 35k on July 30 (0.67k/day), and from there to 30k on Aug. 18 (0.26k/day). Although there is considerable uncertainty in the current rate of decline (it could be closer to 0.47k/day), it's clear that the decline is slowing and that the Delta wave is approaching. 3.5 weeks ago, I thought we'd likely be seeing cases starting to rise by now, but instead, it looks like maybe cases will start rising within the next 2 to 4 weeks.  We may see an abrupt transition from decline to rise. In the UK, cases were already low and almost plateaued when Delta emerged. If we think of the case curve as the sum of 2 separate curves, Delta and non-Delta, then in the UK, the Delta curve was somewhat to the right (in time) of a full decline in non-Delta cases. The same was true in the US. I suspect that in Brazil, the 2 curves are going to be squished closer together. Delta is coming up in numbers and percentage while non-Delta cases are still in fairly steep decline. I suspect that at some point over the next few weeks, there's going to be a comparatively sudden turnaround, at which point Delta will already be going strong enough to have made up for ongoing declines in non-Delta cases; in other words, the starting point for the Delta wave in Brazil will appear to be much higher than it was in the US or the UK. In other words, if Brazil's non-Delta cases were really low now as they were in the UK and the US just before their Delta waves, I suspect we might all be saying that the Delta wave has already started or is about to start. When the Delta wave will *appear* to start in Brazil (meaning that we see total cases start to go up), how fast cases will rise, and how high the peak will be are still the open questions, to my mind. If we suppose that cases start increasing in early September, then we will essentially see 2 months of a Delta wave for the remainder of this question. As of right now, Brazil is at 20.46M cases. By the time cases start to increase, the total may be around 21M.

Combined with the relatively high number already exposed I wouldn't be surprised to see the daily spread continue to slow (finally). Moving average has been dropping almost 1k/day over the last month. Lets say it averages ~33k/day over the next month and vaccinations remain steady, that's 20.3M mid-august and ~55% first dosed. Then close to 20k/day for the next month, so ~21M mid-sept and >60% 1st dosed. Shy of a new variant that breaks the trend I'm not seeing it over 22M on Nov 12. That said, as @belikewater notes (https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1308857), Delta isn't a factor there yet, so it's possible the trend could be wrecked in a bad way. I suspect the true number of infections has been much higher than reported, so hopefully there's more herd immunity than we can account for.

The peak this year is a bit earlier than last year's peak, though, and I'm not sure whether this is due to fewer susceptibles around, more precautions, or both. I think we can expect cases to continue to decline overall for a while now. But Delta has yet to hit. Delta is present in Brazil but represents <0.5% of all sequences in the past 60 days. Its frequency seems to be rising in the small numbers of recent samples. It's hard to say what its current frequency in Brazil is, but I'll say it's in the ballpark of 2%. If other countries offer any guide, cases won't start to increase until Delta cases are approximately 2/3 of new cases. In the US, Delta went from approximately 2% to 2/3 of all cases in a bit over 2 months. In the UK, the same transition happened over about 6 weeks. So, perhaps cases will continue to decline in Brazil over the next almost 5 to 7 weeks, then plateau for 2 to 4 weeks, and then start rising again somewhere around mid September to early October. So, I will estimate that ~1.9M or fewer cases will be added by late August or early September, cases will plateau around 10k-20k starting somewhere around late August or early September (plus or minus a few weeks), adding 0.1M to 0.6M, and then cases will start to increase again sometime between mid September to mid October. It's possible that Brazil's population has more immunity to the virus than elsewhere because restrictions have been so lacking, so it's possible that the rise there won't be as steep as in the UK and the US. The main vaccine they're using there is not the most effective, but it helps, too. The total is currently 19.26M. Before a rise in cases, I'll expect in the ballpark of 1.5 to 2.5M cases to be added to the total. Once cases start rising, I'd expect in the ballpark of 1.0M to be added. So, with giant error bars, I'll expect 2.5M to 3.5M cases to be added as of Nov. 12, for a total of 21.8M to 22.8M. The total could be lower if the decline is steep over the next month or so, as it has been. So, I'm concentrating my forecast on the lower bins. Update 7/19: The consensus has shifted towards the second bin, but I still think there's a substantial chance of the first bin, especially if the current decline continues to be steeper than the decline last winter and spring (in Brazil).
