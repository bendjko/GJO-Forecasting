And banks are mostly estimating 5 hikes in 2022. [3] At 4 hikes my guess would be at the economic projections meetings in March, June, September, and December, but 5 makes May more likely I think. Finally this CME group tool [4] is giving a very high chance of hikes in all of March, May, and June. But if I'm understanding it correctly it gives a 0% chance of no hike in May, which to me seems implausibly low so I'm wondering if there's a weird methodology quirk and it makes me discount their information some. Overall I feel that the FED sees inflation as higher than expected but likely to ease in 2022 due to smoothing of supply chain issues, and I would think they wouldn't want to raise rates too suddenly and risk hurting markets.

If they don't start in March, they have to start in May, because further wait would be untenable. Either way, the May rate will be higher than the March one.  The only way the May rate is the same as in March would be if the economy crashes in the next few months, which would be a major surprise.

Fed officials had already indicated in December that they expected to raise interest rates three times in 2022, something that was repeated in the release on Wednesday. The market\u2019s response last month was muted, but investors reacted strongly to the detailed minutes with a growing sense that higher interest rates were inevitable as the outlook for the economy has only improved since then. Government bond yields are seen as a proxy for investor expectations about interest rates, and they jumped on Wednesday. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes climbed as high as 1.71 percent, a level not seen since April, when bond yields were spiking over concerns about inflation. Higher bond yields can dampen investor interest in riskier investments like stocks. And big technology stocks, which have proved sensitive to changing views on interest rates, were sharply lower. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite fell 3.3 percent, its worst one-day performance since late February. Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, fell 4.6 percent while Microsoft dropped 3.8 percent and the Facebook parent company Meta dropped 3.7 percent. Apple fell more than 2.5 percent and Amazon slid nearly 2 percent. The sheer size of the tech giants \u2014 Apple was a $3 trillion colossus as of Monday \u2014 means they can influence the direction of major benchmarks like the S&P 500. Fed officials had said in December that the central bank would quicken its pullback on large-scale purchases of government-backed bonds to cool down inflation, paving the way for the Fed to raise interest rates as soon as March. . . . .\n. . . \nOne reason investors may have reacted strongly on Wednesday, rather than in December when the central bank first said it would move more quickly to remove economic support, is recent data about the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, said Anu Gaggar, a strategist at Commonwealth Financial Network. The emergence of the variant, in late November, had created an uncertain outlook for the economy that might have discouraged the Fed from acting too quickly, Ms. Gaggar said. But data now suggests that the new variant is milder than initially feared and that the wave of infections may peak soon. \u201cIt appears the economic impact of the Omicron variant is going to be much more muted than what we thought in December, when the Fed announced the taper and the rate hikes,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you factor that in, the market is actually starting to believe that the Fed will do what they say they will do.\u201d Two key reports of economic data will arrive over the next week and help guide the Fed . . . . December\u2019s job report is scheduled to be released on Friday, and economists expect a gain of about 400,000 jobs last month. A separate report on Tuesday showed that the number of Americans quitting their jobs is the highest on record. The Fed minutes noted that members were closely watching the labor market, with some meeting participants saying that work force conditions may already be consistent with maximum employment. And the Labor Department will report fresh data on consumer prices in December next Wednesday.

Using the wisdom of markets (not only on this site but using the futs/options market) it appears there is a high probability (~46%) of a hike in March, with reasonably odds for a May or June hike as well (32%, 48% respectively). But this question is interesting because it's conditional on what happens in March. I.e. do they raise in March or push off to May? And if they raise is March, will they feel they have to raise in May as well or push off to June (which odds seem to imply). Odds markets seems to imply a March, *June* (edited), and Sept (or Dec) raise to satisfy the Fed's 3 in '22 target. @JPH summarized this fairly well. With that said --- I willk note that Jay Powell was pretty clear that they'll only think about raising rates when the taper is complete -- and current estimates suggest that is by March. So I think it would be too aggressive to complete the aggressive+liftoff rates in the same month. Considering there is already uncertainty with how the market will react to the completion of the taper. So if we do hike in March, its doubtful we'll need a May hike (=same). I'll split the difference between the crowd on here (30% same) and the wisdom of futures (45%) and call it 37%. With that, I'll put the remainder on higher which accounts for a hold off in March and a raise in May. Not marries to this but think it's fair to believe we hold off in March (on account the taper was tightening enough) and raise in May to stifle any lingering inflationary pressures.

Given that inflation is still rising and is way above the target, there will almost certainly be a rate rise in the first half of next year, save for some economic disaster (could be covid related or otherwise). I think the chance of a rate hike is at ~90-95% to occur in the first half of next year. One question as @Anneinak points out is whether a rate hike takes place before or at March's meeting or not. I think a lot of this depends on whether inflation continues to spike in the numbers released for December (released Jan 12th), January (released Feb 10th) and February (released March 10th). The December numbers will be released before the January Fed meeting (https://www.bls.gov/schedule/news_release/cpi.htm), and the January + February numbers before the March meeting. But at the May meeting they will only have March inflation numbers - not April.  My feeling with this is that even if the Fed raises rates in March, that doesn't mean they won't be raising rates again in May. Going in March would signal that inflation is more of a worry than previously anticipated, and they are unlikely to see effects of a higher rate by May. In fact, as mentioned above, they will only have one additional data point which their interest rate hike would have affected (March inflation data) - and even then only partially.

Fed has stated that it will not raise rates until tapering is done because it would be counteracting. Current \"dot plot\" shows all 18 members expect at least 1 hike in 2022, with the vast majority expecting at least 2 hikes. Fed stopped using the word \"transitory\" for current inflation, giving cover for strong action in 2022 and 2023. Odds strongly favor multiple hikes, likely 3, starting in March or May. Initial forecast strongly favors a May hike, with lesser possibility that data forces either earlier more dramatic action or outright delay which could leave rates steady in May. Would need significant counter evidence to suggest a decrease in May 2022, so probability very low for now.
