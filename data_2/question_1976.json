Here is what I know  a) Retroactive adjustments are likely- mostly because of a delay in reporting and these are likely to add to the numbers.\nb) Cases are falling, at least 15% in the last 2 weeks. This ought to translate into lower hospitalizations  i.e. of course we should expect decreases in hospital admissions that will be lower than case decrease.\nc) This is a weird one- could easily trip me up. Hospital admissions are lower on the weekends- that just seems to be empirically true and not just an artifact of reporting.  Would that mean, we should see lower numbers for the balance of days? May be. (a) is a blackbox, at least the backlog if it exists, shouldn't be significant- unlike the vaccinations. (b) is true on average, very hard to be conclusive about *this* particular week.
