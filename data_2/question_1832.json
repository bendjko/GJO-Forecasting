I could make the argument that the base rate should be the rate of expansion by China in the SCS (or even more generally, http://www.ecoti.in/oa99LY), rather than the rate of ADIZ development historically, as the ADIZ is really just another form of expansion (vertical expansion, into the air domain).

I actually think the inside view bumps up the base rate, in this case. 1. great point made by @Monkeywithdarts that COVID context and much lower air traffic through SCS gives China a rare opportunity to throw up an ADIZ without nearly the visibility and provocation it would otherwise cause; 2. another smart observation by @Poli_Sci_Guy - that for the last 20 years China has tested new administrations very early on with provocations.

As it turns out (https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R43894.pdf), Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Philippines, Burma, Vietnam, and India all declared ADIZ's more than 20 years ago, mostly in the post-war periods, following the US lead of first establishing them in 1950.

China's declaration of their first ADIZ in the ECS came with some warning--preceding research and expressed intent to create one, which we lack in this case (but with the acknowledgment that they don't need to do research for this second one), but the official declaration took place the same day that the ADIZ became active and just before a high-profile visit by Biden to China, Japan and ROK.

China developed the necessary infrastructure for a South China ADIZ several years ago, however, they have yet to enact one.  While China can declare an ADIZ with little warning, this would be a significant departure from the status quo and likely be preceded by some other geopolitical event. As early as 2015, China built runways and high-frequency radar stations on several islands and reefs in the South China Sea.  Since this time, they have deployed airborne early warning aircraft, surface-to-air missile systems and anti-ship missile systems to these locations.  With these capabilities already in place, China could enact a new ADIZ with very little advance notice. China, Japan, South Vietnam, South Korea and the Philippines have all declared ADIZs at one time or another (South Vietnam\u2019s and the Philippines\u2019 are no longer active).  Each of these countries established an ADIZ after some major geopolitical event like the Korean War or Vietnam War.  China established the region\u2019s most recent ADIZ in 2013 in the East China Sea.  China announced their intention in 2010 but did not actually establish the ADIZ until 2013, after Japan nationalized the disputed Senkaku Islands. Today, China has little to gain from proactively declaring an ADIZ in the South China Sea.  China and ASEAN re-entered talks for a South China Sea Code of Conduct in September 2020.  While the COVID Pandemic has delayed negotiation, China hopes to ratify an agreement sometime in 2021.  Proactively declaring an ADIZ would undoubtedly disrupt this process. Like in 2013, China may reactively declare an ADIZ if they feel another nation directly threatens their territorial claims.  This perspective is more in line with recent statements from pundits sympathetic to the CCP\u2019s territorial claims.  With only 49 days until 1 March, I would assess the probability of such an event as low (8%).  China has already established a dominant position in the disputed islands of the South China Sea.  Competing nations have not telegraphed the intention or the ability to challenge China\u2019s position in the near future. However, a South China Sea ADIZ may also be a collateral effect of China\u2019s diplomatic position with Taiwan.  On 9 January 2021, the U.S. Secretary of State lifted all self-imposed diplomatic restrictions with Taiwan, a move China views as highly provocative.  Although not directly tied to Taiwan, China may enact a South China Sea ADIZ to assert their dominance in the region early in the Biden Administration\u2019s term in office.

I could make the argument that the base rate should be the rate of expansion by China in the SCS (or even more generally, http://www.ecoti.in/oa99LY), rather than the rate of ADIZ development historically, as the ADIZ is really just another form of expansion (vertical expansion, into the air domain). But for now, I'll use the 8% base rate that @pietrokc calculated, based on the time elapsed from consideration to establishment of the ECS ADIZ from 2007-2013.  How does that base rate get modified by the inside view? I actually think the inside view bumps up the base rate, in this case. 1. great point made by @Monkeywithdarts that COVID context and much lower air traffic through SCS gives China a rare opportunity to throw up an ADIZ without nearly the visibility and provocation it would otherwise cause; 2. another smart observation by @Poli_Sci_Guy - that for the last 20 years China has tested new administrations very early on with provocations.

On Wikipedia I found that the first ADIZ was established 70 years ago, and that there are ~30 of them today (counting expansions of existing ones) [1]. This count is uncertain as I couldn't find a real list anywhere. In any case, that makes for an ~11% average chance that an ADIZ will be created or expanded somewhere in any given 3-month period. However this question is about one specific ADIZ, so the base rate for that is lower. Another base rate: China had been considering the East China ADIZ since at least Dec 2007, and it finally was implemented in 2013, 6 years later. That puts the average rate of ADIZ creation/expansion in China at less than 6% every 3 months. So let's call the base rate for this event, 8%. INSIDE VIEW\nThis specific ADIZ is more controversial than the average ADIZ in that it covers an area that other countries claim. On the other hand, some in the defense community have noted that China expanded into the SCS in a big way, building bases, ports and whatnot; and put this forward as evidence that they will declare ADIZ there. Of course, for X to be evidence for Y, we need to consider also the chance that X happens even when Y doesn't. In this case, China could be expanding into SCS even without the intention of declaring ADIZ. So here is my simple bayesian calculation. We noted above that the raw probability of ADIZ in the next 3 months is P[ADIZ] = 0.08. We want the probability of ADIZ in the next 3 months, *given that* China is doing all this expansion, P[ADIZ|expansion]. I estimate P[expansion|ADIZ] to be 0.95; if they were planning to do ADIZ they would almost certainly be expanding. Otoh I estimate P[expansion|no ADIZ] to be 0.7. Even if they were not planning ADIZ in the next 3 months, they might still be planning it later (so expansion is still needed), or they might be expanding for non-ADIZ reasons. This means that the raw P[expansion] is 0.95*0.08 + 0.7*0.92 = 0.72. So by Bayes' theorem we have P[ADIZ|expansion] = P[expansion|ADIZ]*P[ADIZ]/P[expansion] = 0.95*0.08/0.72 ~ 11%. The part that I'm least sure about is P[expansion|no ADIZ], so it's reassuring that the final estimate is not that sensitive to it, because the base rate P[ADIZ] is so low. If I had used P[expansion|no ADIZ]=0.5 instead, I would get 13% instead of 11%.

This information raises my forecast slightly.\nhttps://thediplomat.com/2020/11/is-china-preparing-to-set-up-an-adiz-in-the-south-china-sea-with-taiwan-in-mind/"], [96756, "2020-11-13T03:57:22Z", [0.65], "China has clearly stated their intent to establish an ADIZ in the South China Seas. PRC state-run media declared intent to establish these in ECS and SCS back in 2008. Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of National Defense (MND) reported on 4 May 2020 that China was planning to set up an ADIZ in the SCS. The CCP cannot back down on its territorial claims in the SCS without catastrophically losing legitimacy with domestic audiences. It has backed itself into a corner with its territorial claims. Enforcing an ADIZ in this area is operationally paramount to asserting these claims. However, the question is not does China have intent or a plan, but will they actually declare an ADIZ. This appears to be more of a question of when, not if.\nChina carried out its promise in the ECS. On November 23, 2015, China made a sudden declaration of an ADIZ in ECS. Why hasn\u2019t it also declared the SCS ADIZ? The fact that tensions haven\u2019t triggered a SCS ADIZ may indicate that USN pressure in the SCS is working. Will this strategy change under Biden?\nWhether the Biden Administration will shift its China policy by 1 Mar 2021 and pull back any of the US military forces deployed to the area is unclear. The Biden Administration will be under a lot of pressure to be tough on China. A new poll conducted by the Pew Research Center found that 73 percent of Americans had an unfavorable view of China, the highest in at least 15 years. Under the Obama Administration, Biden was criticized in earlier years for being quixotic in his foreign policy, although he and Obama became increasingly jaded over time in their view of China\u2019s authoritarian and expansionist policies. His platform has been talking pretty tough on China. However, Biden has to deal with Covid-19 and the economy. China\u2019s view of the Biden administration also has relevance, in anticipating their view of the costs/risks of declaring an ADIZ. Recent remarks by state-run media imply that China will see the Biden administration as an improvement over Trump, but China will not harbor any hopes that Biden policies will be consistent with its own objectives; basically, PRC patience will not change US regional policy in their favor anytime soon (with regard to China\u2019s territorial claims in the SCS). The only advantage that time buys them is a chance to further build up their military strength to better enforce a SCS ADIZ later (which may be a challenge for them now, but my data on this is limited).  A potential advantage (that China MAY perceive) of acting in the near-term, is leveraging the chaos of the US administration changeover. \u201cForeign adversaries believe that the United States is preoccupied during transitions, and it\u2019s in our national security interest to demonstrate that we are not,\u201d said David Marchick, director of the Center for Presidential Transition. (WPost) In summary, if we assume that China will not relent on its SCS claims and that it perceives an ADIZ as central to that goal, is China 1) willing to wait 4/8 years for a new administration (after Biden) that may or may not be more receptive to honoring its territorial claims (assuming nationalistic domestic elements will accept this), or, if not, 2) will there be any more opportune time militarily to make this move than right now? Taiwan's reporting buttresses the claim that China intends to make this move in the near-term. https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/The-Big-Story/US-election-Trump-s-China-policy-is-here-to-stay-no-matter-who-wins\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/07/world/asia/china-biden-media-reaction.html\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/defense-transition-trump-election/2020/11/11/7ca500a2-21ff-11eb-8599-406466ad1b8e_story.html\nhttps://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R43894.pdf\n"], [96796, "2020-11-13T03:35:28Z", [0.1], "As US support for Taiwan increases, as seen in the sale of MQ-9B, China will be driven to assert more force in the area.  One way to do this is to establish and ADIZ in the South China Sea.  While I believe at some point China will establish an ADIZ in the area, I need to look at the chance they would prior to 1 March 2021.  China has typically been instigated by US ships in the area and have responded to other international disagreements with an increase in activity in the South China Sea.  I see the biggest factor in determining the timing is the changeover of US leadership in January.  China is not in a strategic rush to implement an ADIZ, so they will wait until it\u2019s necessary to assert dominance.  So as not to instigate unrest with a new president, I think it is unlikely they will assert an ADIZ over any part of the SCS prior to 1 March 2021.

I believe the likelihood they will establish another one before March is largely dependent on who wins the 2020 US Presidential race.  If President Trump wins, China is likely less inclined to alter the relationship in a negative way.

So the real question here is when will they do so.  I'm definitely projecting here, but if I were China I would set it up when I expected to be able to enforce it without inciting a crisis and/or when I could use it as a bargaining tool in some way. The country most likely to interfere with China's ability to enforce the ADIZ, either directly or indirectly, is the U.S.  The most pertinent event to this question from the U.S. side between now and March is the change (probably) of administrations. If I'm China I'm probably not going to gamble on a Trump administration response but I might want to make this an opening gambit in my relationship with a Biden administration.

Additionally, the circumstances of that event are very different. However, information from the ECS ADIZ declaration can aid as a potential indicator of China actions. The ECS ADIZ caused a lot of angst for all parties, China included. Although China might be consider themselves as overall successful in establishing the ECS ADIZ, they were not initially prepared to enforce the ADIZ. Therefore, China may not establish a SCS ADIZ until they are feel prepared to enforce. PRC messaging indicates that there may be plans already developed to eventually declare an ADIZ over parts of the SCS, when they are prepared. It is difficult to determine what level of preparedness China requires prior to establishing the SCS ADIZ. Perhaps, they are already prepared and are waiting for the appropriate time to make an announcement. They do have multiple air bases established in the SCS with defensive systems, therefore, it seems logical to suggest that they may be close to readiness level necessary to enforce an ADIZ. The ECS ADIZ was announced in November of 2013 and overlaps other countries ADIZs. Any extension of the ECS ADIZ or the declaration of new ADIZ will cause significant international attention. With only one other China example, it might be necessary to expand to other states that have established ADIZs. However, these events are very infrequent and don\u2019t exhibit clear patterns. Any increased tension in the SCS or significant opposition or challenge to China in the SCS will increase the likelihood of an SCS ADIZ. Currently, through opensource information, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any indicator of China\u2019s motive to declare a new or updated ADIZ."], [96748, "2020-11-12T20:33:36Z", [0.05], ""], [96763, "2020-11-12T19:29:04Z", [0.05], "China established an ADIZ in the East China Sea in 2013.

The PRC also seems inclined to make declarations when overtly threatened by the US or another nation. This seems less likely given the US election result and Chinese officials statements vis-a-vis a Biden vs Trump administration. I suspect that Xi Jinping's administration will wait to see what the Biden administration's policy in regard to China are before taking proactive actions like declaring an ADIZ (this would only be 40 days into a new presidency). The PRC's foreign minister greeted the election result positively. Much of the antagonism that has driven Chinese declarations in the South China Sea has been related to US Naval Patrols, which seem unlikely in the current environment in the US after the firing of the Defense Secretary and during a probable election transition. The PRC has only declared a single ADIZ since its inception over the East China Sea in 2013. This is such a rare event that a frequentist model is useless. The PRC officially holds that the South China Sea islands are the sovereign territory of China much as was claimed about the East China Sea islands. Both claims have been met with skepticism internationally. Conversely, if another rare event were to occur like a Trump surprise victory in the US election then this would increase the likelihood of this event as the PRC sees Trump's position as more clearly anti-PRC and the chaos in the US from a highly contested election would give the PRC more room to maneuver internationally to avoid sanctions from such a declaration. Thus, without a party platform for this announcement, without an overt international reason driving its immediacy, lacking overt antagonism by its main rival, but with the possibility for a rare event to destabilize this situation I would estimate a probability of around 20.0% per year.

Currently, shoals, reefs, and man-made islands in the South China Sea fail to meet the standard of undisputed land that would provide justification for an ADIZ over sovereign land. Coupled with the direct challenge to FONOPS by the US and the implied risk such a provocative move could have on the trade routes to the SCS, this would be a risk without enforceable gain.
