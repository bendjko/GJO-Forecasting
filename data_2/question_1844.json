If that holds, the overall would be around 90,330. Widening the range a bit (either it tails off to closer 300 or ramps up to an average of 500 per day) makes the range 89,131 to 91,531 Will track and see the enrollment trends... but would be most interesting is if there was a way to see the number of people that actually complete the course after signing up. That would be a more interesting question!\n"], [1646, "2020-11-18T13:06:24Z", [0.0, 0.09, 0.29, 0.27, 0.35], ""], [1646, "2020-11-18T13:05:46Z", [0.0, 0.03, 0.25, 0.27, 0.45], ""], [1646, "2020-11-18T12:44:58Z", [0.0, 0.02, 0.06, 0.27, 0.65], ""], [73970, "2020-11-18T07:59:05Z", [0.99, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [73970, "2020-11-18T07:52:40Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.13, 0.87], ""], [94556, "2020-11-18T04:35:43Z", [0.16, 0.55, 0.25, 0.02, 0.02], ""], [94556, "2020-11-18T04:34:02Z", [0.33, 0.56, 0.05, 0.03, 0.03], ""], [94556, "2020-11-18T04:31:53Z", [0.0, 0.02, 0.05, 0.07, 0.86], ""], [11278, "2020-11-18T02:35:42Z", [0.05, 0.15, 0.35, 0.4, 0.05], ""], [49359, "2020-11-18T01:38:16Z", [0.0, 0.7, 0.3, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [86946, "2020-11-18T01:13:20Z", [0.3, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [57778, "2020-11-18T01:09:10Z", [0.4, 0.34, 0.15, 0.06, 0.05], ""], [57778, "2020-11-18T00:54:21Z", [0.5, 0.3, 0.1, 0.05, 0.05], ""], [92079, "2020-11-18T00:28:40Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [95565, "2020-11-17T22:44:18Z", [0.0, 0.14, 0.75, 0.11, 0.0], ""], [62808, "2020-11-17T22:13:51Z", [0.0, 0.2, 0.8, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [62808, "2020-11-17T21:57:52Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], "What an interesting and pleasant subject online course.. ^..^"], [75093, "2020-11-17T21:57:43Z", [0.15, 0.7, 0.15, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2020-11-17T20:01:01Z", [0.03, 0.15, 0.73, 0.08, 0.01], ""], [88452, "2020-11-17T19:16:29Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.12, 0.88], ""], [59881, "2020-11-17T18:41:07Z", [0.01, 0.99, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""]], "open_date": "2020-11-17T18:00:44Z", "close_date": "2020-11-29T08:01:44Z"}
