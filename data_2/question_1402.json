I think this could go either way (Con, Lab). Richmond Park has recently switched back and forth between Con and LD. Large remain vote of 71% likely to mean LDs will win seat from Con this time.  Cheltenham held by Con but has strong LD presence and is 57% remain. LD likely to take this seat helped by Green Party standing down as part of remain alliance.  NE Fife is an ex LD stronghold won by SNP by 2 votes in 2017. Could revert back to LD but depends how strong Scottish independence vote is.  Brecon was won by LD from Con in a by election this year and could well be held by LD following the alliance with Plaid and the Greens.  52% leave vote. Likely to stay LD. Canterbury is a 55% remain constituency with a large student population.  Lab won from Con last time by a narrow margin. This time the election will be at the end of term. If students mobilise and vote in Canterbury rather than their home constituencies, Lab should hold. Workington voted 60% leave and has an older than average population.  This is a traditional Lab constituency and is being targeted by Con. Brexit party are also standing here and are likely to take votes from disgruntled voters who voted leave. This is likely to split the leave vote and may allow Lab to hang onto this seat. Bolsover has been a Lab constituency for decades and incumbent Dennis Skinner has also been there for decades.  Unlikely that he will be voted out although 70% voted leave. The Brexit party are standing here and this could result in the leave vote being split and Lab retaining the seat. Kensington is a difficult one to call. A highly affluent part of London, traditionally Con but with a 69% remain vote. Ex Con Minister Sam Gyimah standing for LDs this time around could result in the remain vote being split and Con taking the seat.  Crewe was narrowly won by Lab from Con last time and voted 60% leave. This one could go either way.  Tactical voting may well play a part in these constituencies and there are now numerous sites explaining who eg remain supporters in Kensington should vote for including sites by the vote remain alliance, the people' vote, etc."], [80559, "2019-11-16T07:21:33Z", [0.03, 0.11, 0.44, 0.39, 0.03], ""], [56, "2019-11-15T23:45:56Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.5, 0.3, 0.05], "[Erased calculations on this forecast because they were wrong and I don't wish to mislead anyone.]\nSee update: https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/924879 Hastings & Rye: Sally-Ann Hart is a new Tory candidate running against Peter Chowney, the Labour candidate that came within 346 votes of beating the Tory incumbent Amber Rudd, who was the Home Secretary in the last election. It's been in Tory hands for an age and voted Leave by a ~10% margin. So, let's say 40% chance of a change.[1,2,3] Richmond Park: Zac Goldsmith is the Tory incumbent that won last time around by 45 votes over Sarah Olney of LIberal Democrats. Given the 71% vote for Remain, it's hard to see the Tories holding on to this seat, particularly when you consider that she one it from him in a by election in 2016. But, on the other hand, Zac Goldsmith is one of the wealthiest MPs. I'll give it 70% chance of a change.[4,5] Cheltenham: Alex Chalk of the Tories in the incumbent. There's a 15% plus margin to Remain and last election was a Liberal Democrat seat in 2010. Financial Times has an article that the odds favor Liberal Democrats here, so let's say 60% of a change.[6,7,8]  North East Fife: Liberal Democrat stronghold for years. Their Remain message is going to resonate with a +27% advantage to Remain votes. I think the chance of this flipping is almost a certainty, 90%.[9,10,11] Canterbury: Rosie Duffield is the Labour incumbent. She narrowly defeated the Tories in their stronghold last go around in a surprise win. The +9% remain vote will help, but everyone is going to be investing a lot of resources to win this seat. The key is that the Liberal Democrat Tim Walker pulled out of the race three days ago, which I think puts Rosie over the top. Only 20% chance of this seat flipping. [12,13] [Edit: Looks like Liberal Democrats are still fielding someone, which makes me think this has probably a 60% chance of flipping.] Workington: I think this says it all: \"The Conservatives\u2019 hopes of taking Workington will have been boosted this weekend by a Survation poll for the Daily Mail which found that they were on course to win by more than 4,000 votes, with a 10-point swing from Labour.\" I'd put it at about 95% chance this flips. [14,15] Bolsover: Dennis Skinner is Labour's \"Beast of Bolsover\", political royalty. Labour has been taking a beating here with 70% voting Leave. But, Skinner is the forever incumbent and well liked. I think he'll pull it out. Let's say 35% chance of flipping.[16,17] Kensington: Tempting to think that the Liberal Democrats will split the vote in this one and leave the door open for the Tories. But, Sam Gyimah, the Liberal Democrat candidate, was formerly a Tory and has recently made some remarks that will likely sink his bid, despite ~2/3 voting for Remain. Tories probably have about a 20% of taking this one, given they are fielding a newcomer.[18,19] Crewe and Nantwich: Laura Smith was a surprise win by Labour in 2017. She's a former school teacher and closely tied to Corbyn. Given a constituency that voted +20% on Leave, I think the chances are good, 80%, this flips to the Tories.[20,21] Brecon & Radnorshire: This seat was won by Liberal Democrat Jane Dodds in a by-election caused by a recall because the previous Tory MP has a scandal involving expense reports. It was seen as a test of Boris Johnson at the time. Conservatives have held this seat for the last two elections, and they have a fresh face in Fay Alicia Jones. I think there's a 80% this seat flips. Personally, I'd vote for Lady Lily the Pink of the Official Monster Raving Loony Party.[22,23] [1] http://democraticdashboard.com/constituency/hastings-and-rye/\n[2] https://www.hastingsindependentpress.co.uk/politics/ge2019-sally-ann-hart/\n[3] https://vote.labour.org.uk/peter-chowney\n[4] http://democraticdashboard.com/constituency/richmond-park\n[5] http://www.swlondoner.co.uk/general-election-2019-meet-the-richmond-park-candidates/\n[6] http://democraticdashboard.com/constituency/cheltenham\n[7] https://www.gloucestershirelive.co.uk/news/cheltenham-news/general-election-2019-candidates-standing-3541625\n[8] https://www.ft.com/content/9ef28158-04a4-11ea-a984-fbbacad9e7dd\n[9] http://democraticdashboard.com/constituency/north-east-fife\n[10] https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/general-election-2019-the-key-scottish-battleground-seats-1-5035867\n[11] https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/lib-dems-target-snps-stephen-20851260\n[12] http://democraticdashboard.com/constituency/canterbury\n[13] https://news.yahoo.com/lib-dem-candidate-tim-walker-215023590.html\n[14] http://democraticdashboard.com/constituency/workington\n[15] https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/02/workington-man-cumbria-brexit-labour-bellwether-town-general-election\n[16] http://democraticdashboard.com/constituency/bolsover\n[17] https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-7668911/DAN-HODGES-Jeremy-Corbyns-Brexit-betrayal-kill-Beast-Bolsover-49-years.html\n[18] http://democraticdashboard.com/constituency/kensington\n[19] https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/lib-dem-sam-gyimah-grenfell-fire-election-labour-emma-dent-coad-tories-a9198921.html\n[20] http://democraticdashboard.com/constituency/crewe-and-nantwich\n[21] https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/can-labour-win-general-election-20811718\n[22] http://democraticdashboard.com/constituency/brecon-and-radnorshire\n[23] https://www.euronews.com/2019/08/01/why-is-the-brecon-by-election-so-important-to-boris-euronews-answers Yes, I know this answer is mental.
