My prior is based on three different criteria.  1. First, the statistic on peaceful protests being successful about 53% of the time, from @LokiOdinevich. [Our findings show that major nonviolent campaigns have achieved success 53 percent of the time, compared with 26 percent for violent resistance campaigns (https://www.belfercenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/files/IS3301_pp007-044_Stephan_Chenoweth.pdf]. For that I'm assuming a 1.5 year half-life, so that translates to a 21.7% odds over a 6 month period.\n2. The statistic on military regimes attrition of 90% over 10 years (https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1642040). I'm assuming a memoryless process (i.e. if youre in power it doesn't mean youre conditionally more likely to decline, which I think makes sense since sometimes it does mean your closer to the ends and sometimes it just means you have entrenched power). That translates to 10.5% odds.\n3. My own search that Thailand has had on average a change of power every 2 years. Translates to 15.5% odds.  So that prior, on average, is 15.9% (average of all three measures). Call that the outside-in view.  For the inside view, I don't have much of an edge. I have questions and stray thoughts\n- protests can persist for a long time without a change (e.g. I would have thought Carrie Lam would be out in Hong Kong). \n- more broadly, who would replace the PM? Are there other concessions that could be offered \n- secularly, I worry about democracy globally and in Asia. \n- this overthrow is 100% something that will be internal, I don't see any outside power helping one way or the other. With perhaps the exception of Germany telling the king he needs to leave.  I am evaluating the comments here and I see credible perspectives on both sides, with the more credible views drifting a little bit higher. Ian Bremer says the PM is \"massively in danger\", while the monarchy isn't. https://www.gzeromedia.com/in-60-seconds/world2/thailands-monarchy-nigeria-protests-bolivias-new-president-covid-latest. Also some other credible looking forecasts (wide dispersion) are a bit higher. I'll call the Bremer/expert opinion 50%.  My own discretionary opinion, which isn't really stress-tested, is that the protesters made a mistake by going after the monarchy. If they directly went for the prime minister, then it would make sacrificing the PM an easy move for both the military and the king. But since they went after the monarchy initially, if the PM is sacrificed then it's a show of weakness and who's to say the Monarchy isn't next. Call these odds 10%.  I weigh the prior heavily because of the historical data. 75% weight for the prior, 25% weight for the inside view (which I'll give the expert opinion a 2:1 weight view vs mine). That leaves me with 75%*16% + 17%*50% + 8% * 10% = 19.4%.  So this is a tiny revision, but wanted to put my logic out there. Also curious what indicators are worth watching or what objective media sources might be able to indicate if the facts are changing.  I'm trying to think of what factual indicators I'll follow to update my probabilities. "], [691, "2020-10-28T14:45:05Z", [0.36], "Staying fairly high on this.  This guy is wildly unpopular.

However, he has lost influence over the armed forces with his ascension in nominally civilian politics. Prayuth shares power with King Maha Vajiralongkorn, the former playboy crown prince who spends much of his time in Germany counting his billions and enjoying members of his harem, and the new military hierarchy, in which hardliners allied with the king are ascendant. Now tens of thousands of Thais are taking to the streets in protest against this self-serving triumvirate. Thailand was an important U.S. military ally during the Vietnam War. Once known as Siam, it remained independent as Western imperialist powers gobbled up colonies nearby. In 1932, a military coup overturned the absolute monarchy. Since then, Thai politics have tended toward the tempestuous, with 12 coups and 20 constitutions. Prayuth used bodies controlled by military henchmen\u2014250 junta-appointed members of the Senate, the junta-selected Election Commission, and the junta-chosen Constitutional Court\u2014to gerrymander districts, outlaw opposition parties, file charges against hostile politicians, and steal MPs from regime opponents. In today\u2019s Thai system, democracy is but a fa\u00e7ade, acting as lip gloss for the dictatorship in place of the pig. More than 80 protest leaders have been arrested. Gatherings of more than five people have been banned. Riot police have been deployed. Roads have been blocked. Public transit has been closed. The increasingly desperate authorities mulled suspending the app Telegram and censoring television coverage. The regime threatened two-year jail terms for simply posting a selfie at a rally or visiting a protest website. Major General Yingyos Thepjumnong, speaking for the police and thus the junta, declared: \u201cIt is like you are taking your own evidence of disobeying the emergency decree\u201d But still the demonstrators came. Protesters will not be satisfied by platitudes. As one student told the New York Times: \u201cThe goal is to change the whole political system, including the monarchy and the prime minister.\u201d\n\n The new king grabbed control of heretofore public assets worth $30 to $40 billion, asserted personal command over two Bangkok-based military units, and spends most of his time at a German resort accompanied by a retinue of servants and concubines. An unnamed aide told The Economist that his priorities are to \u201cbike, f*ck, eat. He does only those three things.\u201d \n\nhttps://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/2006643/history-not-on-the-side-of-gen-prayut\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Thailand/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayut_Chan-o-cha\nDuring the political crisis that began in November 2013 and involved protests against the caretaker government of Yingluck, Prayut claimed that the army was neutral[10] and would not launch a coup. However, in May 2014, Prayut staged a military coup against the government and assumed control of the country as NCPO leader.[11] He later issued an interim constitution granting himself sweeping powers and giving himself amnesty for staging the coup.[12] In August 2014, an unelected military-dominated national legislature appointed him as Prime Minister.[13][14] *** tl;dr: Prayut Chan-o-cha seems like he has all the levers of power (police, military, monarchy seems absent, senate, political elite).
