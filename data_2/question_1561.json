This article suggests mid-June is a best case scenario. My thinking aligns with their thinking. It will take probably 8-10 weeks for this to sort out, and then a further month before things really kick off again. NBA will probably take it slow, but could potentially do regular season play with no fans, and then let the fans in for the playoffs. That would allow a June start date.
