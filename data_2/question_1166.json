Kim\u2019s comments showed how skeptical North Korea has become regarding the South\u2019s usefulness in talks with the United States, said Shin Beom-chul of the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. \u201cTo them, the South Korean government is only a nuisance,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the message is either \u2018Persuade the United States,\u2019 or \u2018Stay out of it.\u2019\u201d Overseeing Thursday\u2019s launches, Kim Jong Un said the new missiles had to be developed to neutralize the weapons being acquired by South Korea and turn them into \u201cscrap iron\u201d. South Korea\u2019s acquisition of American F-35 stealth fighter jets, the first of which arrived in March, would force its neighbor to develop and test \u201cspecial armaments\u201d to destroy the aircraft, the North had warned in mid-July. While Moon has faced some domestic concern that national security could be affected by his North Korean pacts, from a no-fly zone to fewer guard posts and landmines along the heavily fortified border, he has also pushed ahead with plans to modernize and invest in the South\u2019s already large military. In January the defense ministry unveiled a plan to boost military spending for the next five years by an additional 270.7 trillion won ($228 billion). Still, some observers believe Kim Jong Un is leaving space for engagement by focusing on South Korea\u2019s military. \u201cThe state media report shows the North was still willing to maintain inter-Korean ties, as they mostly targeted the military forces, not the whole government,\u201d said Kim Dong-yup, a professor at Kyungnam University\u2019s Far East Institute in Seoul. An official at Moon\u2019s office said it would not comment on the state media report but the government remained committed to working to revive momentum for nuclear talks.

Based on the naive Bayesian method, we establish a short\u2010term prediction model for North Korea's nuclear and missile tests using international news reports from North Korean media between 2006 and 2018 as a dataset. The test results show that the overall accuracy rate of the model's predictions of North Korean historical activity is greater than 80%, and its robustness is strong. To solve the problem of relatively delayed data collection, we use the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) time series analysis method to simulate the values of feature sets. The estimated data are statistically reliable, and the prediction accuracy is high. This study proves that although the DPRK is extremely closed, it is possible to make relatively accurate predictions of its behavior using appropriate methods. The modeling approach in this paper can provide inspiration for developing general approaches to national behavior prediction.

This summit is known for being symbolic for 1) stating a commitment to denuclearization, and 2) having the Panmunjon Declaration. Since then, 2 other summits have been held between North Korea and South Korea, but the long-awaited visit to Seoul has yet to come to fruition since 2018. It will be a historical moment when the Seoul Summit is held, which must be held for both symbolic and political significance. Plenty of preparatory work must be done between these states, as well as an intention for the Summit to occur. While the possibility of Kim visiting Seoul exists, but there does not seem to be a concerted effort to iron out details of a summit within the next 3 months in general.\nA few key developments which support the likelihood of Kim's visit to Seoul: the aforementioned 2 inter-state summits between North Korea and South Korea that happened within 6 months of the maiden Peace House Summit all within 2018; most recently Kim's sister -representing the delegate of North Korea- visiting the DMZ to commemorate the death of the former South Korean first lady. These are all symbolic gestures, with the third summit occurring in North Korea's capital, Pyongyang, speaking volumes on a commitment to potentially ending the armistice and declaring the inter-state Korean war to be symbolically over, and potential reunification. These developments give a decent possibility that Kim may visit Seoul eventually.\nHowever, thinking that the visit to Seoul occurring before 1st October 2019 seems like a quantum leap to make. Firstly, there has not been a commitment from both countries to work towards the Seoul summit, and given the short timeframe available, it seems highly unlikely. Even if there would be more time available for both countries to work out a schedule, the agenda for the meeting, presumably on honoring the Panmujom Declaration and work towards denuclearization, must happen at the opportune moment. South Korea has been the mediator for the latter commitment towards denuclearization, but seeing how North Korea and the US are still at loggerheads on an agreement between disarmament and lifting embargoes, this author doubts that even South Korea's mediation now would provide an effective solution.\nCurrently, both countries are embroiled in their own political affairs to commit to the Seoul Summit. Kim's international visits now are geared towards securing an ally in China, a potential economic partner and ally who provides a counterweight against the US.

He had a hoop outside the apartment and would play out there often, sometimes making more noise than the neighbors would have preferred. Every day at 5 p.m., when the school bell rang, Kim Jong Un would head to the basketball courts at his school or at the high school in the nearby city of Lerbermatt, less than a 10-minute walk away. He always wore the same outfit for basketball: an authentic Chicago Bulls top with Michael Jordan\u2019s number\u201423\u2014and Bulls shorts and his Air Jordan shoes. His ball was also top of the line: a Spalding with the official mark of the NBA. Kim\u2019s competitive side came out on the basketball court. He could be aggressive and often indulged in trash talk. He was serious on the court, hardly ever laughing or even talking, just focused on the game. When things went badly for him, he would curse or even pound his head against the wall. From his base in Europe, he was even able to see some of the greats. He had been to Paris to see an NBA exhibition game and had photos of himself standing with Toni Kukoc of the Chicago Bulls and Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers. It was his mother, Ko Yong Hui, who first sparked his interest in the sport. There\u2019s an old tale that Korean mothers, North and South, like to tell their children: If you play basketball, you\u2019ll grow taller. Kim Jong Un was short as a child, and his father was not a tall man\u2014he was only 5 foot 3, and famously wore platform shoes to try to compensate\u2014so Ko encouraged her son to play basketball in the hope the tale was true. He grew to be 5 foot 7, so maybe it worked a bit. She was thrilled to see her son taking to basketball, a sport that she believed would help him clear his mind and loosen his childhood obsession with planes and engines. Instead, Kim Jong Un\u2019s mother and aunt soon saw that basketball had become an addiction, too\u2014the boy was sleeping with his basketball in his bed\u2014and one that came at the expense of his studies. His mother would visit Bern regularly to scold her son for playing too much and studying too little."], [23006, "2019-06-17T21:05:16Z", [0.01], ""], [14107, "2019-06-16T14:36:31Z", [0.08], ""], [691, "2019-06-16T12:37:48Z", [0.02], ""], [63963, "2019-06-15T20:11:16Z", [0.0], ""], [1333, "2019-06-15T19:14:47Z", [0.04], ""], [67424, "2019-06-14T21:17:49Z", [0.08], "Update:  There has been a positive sing of the relations between the South and North Korea improving.

Kim Jong Un\u2019s sister, Kim Yo Jong, met South Korean officials in the demilitarised zone last Wednesday. She expressed her condolences on behalf of North Korea concerning the death of former first lady Lee Hee-Ho. Lee and her husband, former president Kim Dae-Jung, are known for their commitment for a peaceful reunification of both Koreas. Therefore, the act of paying respect should be seen as a symbolic gesture of North Korea to South Korea. Indeed, this represents another step for improved relations between both Koreas. Furthermore, North Korea sent a positive formulated letter to Trump, according to the US president. Trump will be visiting South Korea at the end of June before he departures to the G20 summit in Japan. Indeed, this could be a possibility that Kim Jong Un and Trump will meet in Seoul in order to revive their negotiations as both parties declared their interest to continue these.   Nevertheless, these positive signs are overshadowed by recent trends and actions. First of all, the North Korean media didn\u2019t mention any letter to the US, thus undermining the positive signal this could have become. The recent trend in US-North Korean relations is characterized by deterioration. Both sides accuse each other to break the agreements of the Singapore summit. North Korea is unwilling to proceed with its denuclearisation before the US lift sanctions. Contrarily, the US refuses to lift sanction before North Korea doesn\u2019t proceed with its denuclearization program. The US, supported by 26 other nations, accused North Korea to disobey UN sanctions through illegally importing more fuel than stipulated.   It is this gridlock that nullifies any recent positive signals or complaisant statements. Kim Jon Un himself declared that he will wait until the end of the year to determine the future steps of his country. As a result, this update adjusts the likelihood to 7% (a 3% decrease from the initial forecast).

Including the announcement following the  September 2018 inter-Korean summit, were it was announced by Kim & Moon that Kim would visit Seoul by the end of the year (2018) (https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-northkorea-southkorea-summit/north-koreas-kim-says-to-scrap-missile-sites-visit-seoul-idUKKCN1LY30K). However, the visit did not happen, and as of today (9/6-19), a visit had not been announced. Recent developments indicate that the positive developments one observed last year may have come to a halt. For example, the February 2019 Hanoi Summit between President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong Un, which was cut short without an agreement (https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/02/world/asia/trump-kim-jong-un-summit.html). For South Korea this has grave consequences as a close ally to the US on the one hand, but wanting to continue their positive negotiations with the North Korean Chairman. It is understood that as long as US sanctions still cover North Korea it will be difficult for further collaboration between North and South Korea. Even though a visit could still happen, it would most likely happen in connection with some form of negotiations or at least talks about the future. However, the lack of a US-North Korea agreement, as mentioned means that such discussions become impossible (https://www.npr.org/2019/03/04/700173356/why-the-second-u-s-north-korea-summit-dealt-a-setback-to-south-koreas-plans?t=1560083939593). Therefore a visit is unlikely to happen before the US and North Korea can resume their talks. \n\nSince the failed summit, the North Korean Chairman have been on one other international visit, to Russia, to meet with President Putin. It was the Russian President's understanding that North Korea needed international security guarantee in order to give up their nuclear arsenal, hence why he invited the chairman (https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/putin-arrives-in-russian-far-east-ahead-of-first-ever-summit-with-kim-jong-un/2019/04/24/a2d941f8-65c6-11e9-a698-2a8f808c9cfb_story.html?utm_term=.904f42ec9985). Following the meeting Kim invited Putin to North Korea, though as of yet no new meeting has been announced. Another factor that point to a stalemate in the visit plans, is the fact that North Korea in early May launched two short-range missiles (https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-48212045), this was its second weapons test in less then a week. The tests are assumed to be a reaction to the fact that  a top US envoy arrived in South Korea for talks on how to revive nuclear negotiations.  All in all, based on the evidence above I would say that it is very unlikely that Kim Jong Un will visit Seoul before 1 October 2019.

Kim-Jong Un will not visit Seoul before September 1st 2019 due to several reasons: \nThere is a certain time needed to prepare for that visit, surely Kim-Jong Un could come without publicly announcing it, as with the second Inter-Korean Summit that took place last year, but as for now there are no indicators that point towards a visit from the North Korean leader. More so, however, the timing needs to be right. Kim-Jong Un, if he came, should be positively received in South Korea also by the population, which is strongly linked to progress in the denuclearization of North Korea - much more progress is hence needed, for that to be the case. As a matter of fact, the North- South Korean relations have experienced a downturn due to North Korea withdrawing from their South Korean liason office for constant communication in March 2019, as well as engaging in weapon testing in April (https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-47665514?intlink_from_url=https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cp78wz6vexet/north-koreasouth-korea-relations&link_location=live-reporting-story). \nMost important from all, however, the North - South Korean relations are highly dependent on the North Korean - US relations, also due to the aforementioned issues about denuclearisation. The deadlocked US - North Korean diplomatic relations after the meeting between US President Trump and Kim Jong-Un in Hanoi in the past February leave the two nations without a deal, as Kim rejected the 'big deal' by the US to lift sanctions in return for a quick dismantelment of the entire North Korean nuclear weapons program. The summit was dissolved without reaching an agreement (https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/24/world/asia/kim-jong-un-vladimir-putin.html). Furthermore, Kim Jong-Un, who has only been on 5 state visits since entering into his position, travelled to Russia to meet with Vladimir Putin instead to further closer cooperation, and additionally targets hostile comments agains US President Trump (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-usa/north-korea-accuses-us-of-evil-ambition-says-use-of-strength-not-a-us-monopoly-idUSKCN1SZ2AM). \nThis shows a turn from North Korea towards the Soviet side, against the Western US and ultimately also against South Korea. Therefore, a state visit by Kim Jong-Un to Seoul by the 1st September 2019 is highly unlikely.

On this occasion, a single anonymous source has told a newspaper in Seoul that Kim Hyok-chol, the former North Korean envoy to the US and a key figure in talks ahead of the summit between Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump in Hanoi, was executed at an airport in Pyongyang.\nFrom: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-48477248"], [32258, "2019-05-31T22:45:49Z", [0.0], ""], [1333, "2019-05-31T18:15:44Z", [0.05], "After the Hanoi delgation executions - I'd hate be his travel agent..."], [67416, "2019-05-31T14:53:02Z", [0.65], "Typically to answer a question on GJO, a good starting point is a baseline. How often does something similar happens? \nIn order to answer this question, some of my fellow forecasters looked at the meetings of the East/West German leaders. Some others at the visits of american presidents to Vietnam/Cuba. \nI do believe, that asserting baseline is very important, but in case of South/North Korea it is impossible to compare to other cases. The dynamics of the relationship, and  Kim Jong Uns (one man) world perception of is crucial, which disables all comparison to other cases. That is why, I will jump right away into looking at the inner relationship between South/North Korea and if they are motivated to meet.  2018: Kim Jong Un, was the first North Korean leader to cross the border to South Korea since 1953: https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-asia-43916858/kim-jong-un-crosses-korean-border-for-summit\nThere have been 5 summits between North and South Korea. 3 of those took place in 2018. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Korean_summits\nKim-Trumps summit in Singapore. \n2019: Kim-Trumps 2. Summit in Hanoi.  The recent increased frequency of the meetings shows that something has changed. It could be Kim Jong Uns belief, that North Korea should not be, as isolated, as his father wanted. It could be, that North Korea is more pressured, because of the sanctions. It could be, that North Korea has developed the nuclear weapons, and has a good starting point to bargain. But it does not matter, because he is willing to meet and bargain with his rivals/enemies.  So lets look at the factors that drive North Korea Seoul: \n1. Pressured economy. GDP of North Korea had negative growth rate (https://www.indexmundi.com/g/g.aspx?v=66&c=kn&l=en) \n2. There are shortage of food supplies in 2019 (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-sanctions-un/north-korea-warns-of-food-crisis-slashes-rations-before-next-leaders-summit-idUSKCN1QA2X9) \n3. The road to lifting some of the sanctions, that will ease the economic pressure, goes through Moon to Trump.  Does South Korea wants to have a summit in Seoul: \n1. Moon has put his political fortune on improving relationship with North Korea. Kim Jong Uns visit will be historical and help on Moons domestic popularity. That is why Moon will be determent on having a visit in Seoul.     Russia and China helping North Korea with food supplies helps Kim Jong Un to show american administration, that North Korea still has diplomatic alternatives, that to negotiate with USA and South Korea. That could delay the Kim Jong Uns visit. \nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/25/kim-jong-un-meets-vladimir-putin-for-first-time-at-vladivostok-summit All in all, I think it is very likely, that Kim Jong Un will visit Seoul in the near future. It would be historical, as when he crossed the border and met with president of the United States in 2018/19. Four month from now on is plenty of time, and it could be happen soon. That is why around 65 % for that happening before October (only timeframe does not puts it further up).

Bolton took a similar approach to Pyongyang during the Bush administration and blew up a denuclearization deal reached by President Clinton. That agreement wasn\u2019t perfect but, in retrospect, would have avoided the predicament we are in today, facing a nuclear-armed North Korea able to attack American cities. There is a reason why the North Koreans call Bolton \u201cthe father of their nuclear weapons program.\u201d\n....\nThe small deal that was on the table in Hanoi, dismantlement of the large Yongbyon nuclear facility in return for lifting some sanctions, should serve as the basis for further bargaining. Our objective should be to secure dismantlement, particularly the immediate and irreversible disabling of key facilities so they can never be used again. In return, we should be willing to allow more limited sanctions relief than the extensive demands made by Pyongyang. In particular, we should relieve those sanctions that will give South Korea greater leeway in providing assistance to Pyongyang and promoting North-South reconciliation.   We should also be willing to quickly move forward with steps to begin thawing the political relationship between the United States and North Korea. One is a joint declaration that the Korean War is over and the immediate beginning of negotiations for a peace agreement to replace the temporary armistice that halted the war. Another is the establishment of diplomatic relations between our two countries. A third step is people-to-people exchanges between the United States and North Korea, including reuniting Korean-Americans with their relatives in the North.

I therefore think that many other forecasters are way overconfident when they estimate probabilities in the 0-5% range. @pietrokc reached a similar conclusion. I recognise that the short term relationship between the leaders plays an important part nonetheless. The inside view points our attention to some serious obstacles in the short term, most importantly the timeframe of the question, which lowers my estimate. Also the symbolic significance and security concerns of a North Korean visit to Seoul, recent missile test by NK and somewhat of a standstill in the U.S-NK nuclear disarmament negotiations. These obstacles lower my estimate significantly, but no further than to 30%. Outside view\nOther forecasters have already looked at comparisons with East/West Germany but there are other possible cases for comparison in my opinion. These are: North/South Vietnam, India-Pakistan, Taiwan-China  and U.S-Cuban relations. I will look at some of these cases to try and estimate a baserate timeframe. Nonetheless, North Korea is quite unique so comparison has its limitations and my methodology is rather imperfect. Some of the cutoff points for calculating the time frames, for instance, are quite arbitrarily chosen. Borrowing from @mbayer123 and @SRM-Nostradamus, it was 42 years from the from the end of WWII until relations had normalised enough between East/West Germany to allow the first visit by Erik Honecker in West Germany in 1987. In the case of Vietnam, I think it\u2019s more reasonable to look at how long it took for a U.S president to visit. Summarising the historical development after the unification of Vietnam in 1976, it took 24 years until bilateral relations had normalised enough to allow Bill Clinton to visit in 2000. \nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/nov/23/clinton.matthewengel\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Vietnam_since_1945#The_Tet_Offensive_and_the_end_of_the_war\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_visits_to_Southeast_Asia  After the end of the Cuban revolution War it took 57 years for relations to normalise enough so that Obama could visit Havana in 2016. An alternative calculation could be from the end of the Cold War, and in that case it still took 26 years for a visit. \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba\u2013United_States_relations#After_the_Cold_War  It was 1949 when China became communist and the Kuomintang established a government in Taiwan. The first meeting between the two sides was in 2015 after 66 years (it was in Singapore, so I guess it technically hasn\u2019t happened yet. But I\u2019m going to let it pass anyway.)\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma\u2013Xi_meeting\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-Strait_relations\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-34742680  I throwing the towel in the ring with India-Pakistan. The history is very complicated and I don\u2019t have the time or knowledge to be able to make sense of it.  In short, the mean timeframe from hostile relations to a visit is around 47 years. I tried making some statistical estimations from my \u201cpseudo sample\u201d and this showed that, with a mean of 47 years, a 95% confidence interval\u2019s upper boundary would extend to 66 years. This is very pseudo-scientific, but the take away point for me is that a visit to Seoul is not unlikely to happen.

The leaders of the two countries have met five times in total so far, three of which in 2018 alone. Three meetings were held in Pyongyang, and two in the Joint Security Area.  When the two Korean leaders met last September in Pyongyang, Kim said he promised Moon he\u2019d visit Seoul \u201cin a short time.\u201d Moon then said Kim agreed to visit Seoul within the year unless there are \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d. However, this never happened. A summit in Seoul would have much deeper diplomatic weight than those that have come before. Moon was welcomed in Pyongyang by streets filled with tens of thousands of cheering citizens, and he delivered a speech to 150,000 people. Things would be very different in the democratic South, the only Korea with a real public opinion to be accountable to. Many South Koreans still harbor deep anger towards the North, ever since the 1950 attack that started a war that killed and injured millions. In order for a visit to occur, Moon must create a positive atmosphere in the country, and the only way for this to happen is making progress towards the denuclearization of North Korea.

The question of a Kim's visit to Seoul is therefore strictly tied to the chances of the North Korean leader accepting to make concessions on the nuclear front. Kim, his father, and his grandfather spent decades and hundreds of millions of dollars developing a nuclear program that they\u2019ve considered essential to ensure the endurance of their totalitarian regime. No nation with as sophisticated a homegrown nuclear arsenal as North Korea\u2019s has ever given it up. It is hard to imagine that Kim would be the first to do so, nor has he ever stated to be open to such a possibility. I therefore assign only a small likelihood to the \"Yes\" answer.

The analogy between South-North Korea and West-East Germany is more than obvious (@mbayer123 offers good arguments for the comparability of both situations). This forecast will identify key events and underlying socio-political drivers which influenced the reunification in Germany and analyse if similar (or contradicting) key events and drivers can be found in the Korean reconciliation process. Comparing the current events on the Korean peninsula with the historic development in Germany should improve the accuracy of this forecast as it offers a structured orientation to analyse the events taking place.  The German reunification (brief summary): \n-\t1945: End of second world war with 4 administrative zones (each occupied by one Ally)\n-\t1949: Foundation of the German Democratic Republic (GDR)\n-\t1961: Construction of Berlin wall \n-\t1970: First meeting of West and East German leaders in Erfurt (East Germany)  \n-\t1972: Signing of basic treaty between both states leads to diplomatic recognition \n-\t1987: East German leader, Honecker, visits West Germany [in Bonn]  After the second world war the occupied zones formed two major blocs: the east zone (comprising Soviet occupied territories) which became the GDR and the west zone (comprising territories occupied by the US, GB and France) which became the German Federal Republic (GFR). Both states maintained a hostile attitude towards each other which culminated in the construction of the \u201cBerlin wall\u201d. This hostility started to decline with Willy Brandt\u2019s \u201cOstpolitik\u201d (east-policy) as it comprised concessions regarding territorial disputes with soviet states (such as Poland) but also, for the first time in the history of the GFR, contained the promise to acknowledge the GDR as a sovereign state. After a first meeting in 1970 of both leaders from east and west a basic treaty had been signed in 1972 which institutionalized Brandt\u2019s policy as a fundamental pillar of East-West-German relationship. However, it took another 15 years until the first general secretary (= head of the state) visited West Germany. This lengthy process demonstrates that a reconciliation (not to mention reunification) process requires a lot of time and good intention on both sides to improve the relationship. This constitute the first two factors to analyse the Korean history. The presence of \u2018good intentions\u2019 will be determined by the number of meetings, talks and negotiations and the obedience of both states to adhere to stipulated agreements since the ceasefire. Furthermore, this analysis will take into account the occurrence of major benevolent or malicious activities since 2011 as this is the year when Kim Jon-Un succeeded his father. By assessing the event timeline, it will be possible to evaluate the overall trend in the relationship between both Koreas.

A planned second meeting gets cancelled as both countries accuse each other of failing to deliver on agreed terms Like Germany, the divide of Korea along the 38th parallel can be seen as a result of the second world war (with the USSR liberating the North and the US liberating the South of Korea from imperial Japan). In 1950 the North had invaded the South which resulted in a three-year long war with heavy casualties until the signing of a ceasefire agreement in 1953. This constitutes a significant difference to the situation in Germany as there wasn\u2019t a direct military confrontation between both adversaries and shows that the comparability of the two scenarios is to some degree limited. Since then the Korean history is shaped by several attempts of both sides to achieve a reconciliation but also by numerous malicious assaults and breaches of agreements and treaties. The first summit between both countries took place 32 years after the signing of a ceasefire agreement. Such a long phase of total isolation also took place in Germany lasting 21 years. However, it took additional 10 years for such a meeting in Korea and the summit lacked the attendance of the Korean leaders unlike in Germany. The first planned summit to host both leaders, 9 years after the meeting of government representatives, was cancelled due to Kim Il-Sung\u2019s death in 1994. It took another 6 years (15 years after the first summit) until the leaders of the two Koreas met in Pyongyang (North Korea) where they signed a joint declaration to work towards reunification in 2000. The second summit took place in 2007 in Pyongyang. In 2018, for the first time in the Korean history and 18 years after the last summit in Pyongyang, a North Korean leader entered South Korea. Kim Jong-Un met his counterpart Moon Jae-In in the demilitarized zone at the border of both countries. Both leaders met again later the month in the same place. Nevertheless, it required numerous summits and a lengthy time period for a North Korean leader willing to meet \u2018only\u2019 at the border. For comparison, it required 47 years for a meeting between both heads of each state to meet for the first time (in one of their countries), while it took 21 years in Germany for a similar meeting. The Korean reconciliation, indeed, proceeds slower than the German one and new milestones, such as a North Korean leader visiting Seoul, seem unlikely to happen soon. There\u2019s another argument which influences the likelihood of a summit in Seoul: trust between both countries.  A North Korean leader visiting Seoul would represent a highly symbolic move toward reconciliation (or even reunification) and would require that both sides have established a trustworthy relationship between them. As the timeline above illustrates, there were more malicious activities that undermine this trust than there were actions which would boost it. Indeed, North Korea broke several times treaties which had been agreed on in Korean or international summits. Furthermore, numerous attempts to harm South Korean government officials, as well as exchange of fire between military personnel of both countries, indicate that there is no sufficient fundament for both countries to trust each other. Inter-Korean relations depended quite often on the personal stances of South Korean presidents in the past. The relationship improved when presidents in the South were willing to make unconditional concessions, like Kim Dae-Jung\u2019s sunshine policy, and it deteriorated when they adopted a more confrontative stance towards the North. The recent meeting in the demilitarized zone, despite numerous activities of North Korea which provoked the international community, could be seen as a result of Moon Jae-In\u2019s focus on diplomacy and a more open approach towards the North. However, it seems unlikely that he will be able to achieve further significant steps until October which would increase the likelihood of Kim Jong-Un visiting Seoul.  The latest promises of the North Korean leader to meet the South Korean president more frequently to talk about the denuclearization of Korea fit into the timeline of unfulfilled promises. Especially regarding the unsuccessful summit between the US and North Korea and the cancelation of a following summit between both countries decrease the likelihood for an immediate inter-Korean summit in Seoul as North Korea isn\u2019t convinced in South Korea\u2019s ability to influence the US significantly. The US on the other side won\u2019t lift sanctions as long as Pyongyang isn\u2019t willing to proceed significantly with its denuclearization. Recent investigations by \u201cBeyond Parallel\u201d (a research program of the Center for Strategic & International Studies) show continued constructions of missile bases despite promised concessions by Kim Jong-Un. This dilemma very likely won\u2019t dissolve itself before October 2019, however, a small probability for a Seoul summit remains as president Moon Jae-In needs to achieve a diplomatic success as soon as possible in order to boost his party\u2019s popularity for the upcoming general elections in 2020.

Kim Jong Un even promised the president of South Korea to meet him in Seoul in 2019, but nothing has been announced yet. Besides, I don\u2019t think any kind of meeting is going to take place in Seoul before the US and North Korea agree on how to denuclearize the North Korea. Since South Korea and the US have been allies for a long period of time and the US\u2019s major concern is to find way to control the nuclear capabilities of the North Korea, it is obvious that the relations between the US and NK are affecting further development of relations between NK and South Korea.

The best comparison would be Erich Honecker being the first East German leader to visit West Germany in 1987. As history shows this happened during a time of increasing relations and the slow loosening of soviet restrictions, resulting in the fall of the Berlin wall just two years after Honecker's visit. This would suggest that a Kim Jong Un visit to Seoul would be done during times of change and improving relations. This of course isn't a great comparison, but it does show how rare these types of events are.  This prospect of Kim Jong Un visiting Seoul first arose after the first summit between Kim and Trump in Singapore and then after his meeting with President Moon at the North Korean town of Kaesong. It was widely thought that this visit would likely take place after a third summit between the Kim and Trump, presuming everything went well. However, The Second summit in Hanoi produce little if anything. This diplomatic failure has severely hampered positive diplomatic relations and Kim has stated that while he is still open to negotiations, he will only meet for a third summit if the US significantly changes its demands by the end of 2019. The primary objective for Kim is to estrange Trump from his primary advisers, Mike Pompeo and John Bolton, who are more hardliners when it comes to North Korea. It is believed that they are the reason Trump refused to accept North Korea's offer to only partially denuclearize in return for complete sanction lifting. Since then Kim has purposely insulted both Bolton and Pompeo, even at one point calling for Pompeo's resignation. At the end of the day Kim is looking to gain diplomatic leverage as can be seen with his recent meeting with Putin at Vladivostok. However, since then relations have begun deteriorating. North Korea started testing missiles again in response to perceived US military training exercises with South Korea, which the US denies. Moreover, experts noticed that these tested missiles look and act eerily similar to known Russian missiles that have the capability to deliver a nuclear weapon. Then just recently, the US seized a North Korea vessel that it claims was violating UN sanctions.  All of this suggests that since the failure at Hanoi, relations between North Korea and the US, therefore subsequently South Korea, have chilled. Neither party seems willing to budge on their negotiating positions and Kim has refused to make the first move, putting the impetus on the US. Therefore, it becomes extremely unlikely that Kim will visit Seoul before a possible third summit. At this point in time there hasn't been any meaningful posturing towards a third summit therefore, pushing it's potential date further into the year. Then for Kim to visit Seoul after this possible summit, the summit would have to be very successful and would happen after an appropriate amount of time from the summit, not to mention rigorous security plans and itineraries would have to be mapped out. Because of this, I would predict that if a third summit would happen it would happen at the earliest in September and it would have to be very successful to convince Kim to visit Seoul and this visit would most likely happen after October 1st, probably into the year 2020. Therefore, I give this forecast only a 5% chance of happening, because while I believe it is highly unlikely, I also believe that due to Trump's nature there could be rapid developments that could speed this timeline up. https://www.cbsnews.com/news/north-korea-fires-missiles-possible-launch-south-korea-today-live-updates-2019-05-09/\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-48221507\nhttps://www.npr.org/2019/05/08/721135496/north-koreas-newest-missile-appears-similar-to-advanced-russian-design\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-47972954\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/world/north-koreas-kim-open-to-third-trump-summit--but-only-if-us-changes-its-stance/2019/04/13/a24b90be-5db6-11e9-b8e3-b03311fbbbfe_story.html?utm_term=.f736aaafba7f\nhttps://www.nknews.org/2019/04/why-both-kim-jong-un-and-donald-trump-want-a-third-summit/\nhttps://www.scmp.com/week-asia/geopolitics/article/2176977/when-will-kim-jong-un-visit-seoul-if-he-knows-hes-not-telling\n"], [23006, "2019-05-10T02:24:21Z", [0.02], ""], [176, "2019-05-09T23:43:54Z", [0.0], "Bolton soon to be sacked: https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/a-frustrated-trump-questions-his-administrations-venezuela-strategy/2019/05/08/ad51561a-71a7-11e9-9f06-5fc2ee80027a_story.html?utm_term=.beafbee63b24 Does that leave any time for this question?

The North Korean news agency KCNA reported on Sunday that the exercise took place on Saturday - when North Korea apparently fired a short-range missile for the first time in more than a year. Kim had also examined \"the combat performance of weapons and equipment\" and reminded the soldiers of the \"iron truth\" that \"true peace and security are only secured and guaranteed by powerful strength\". It was only on last Friday that South Korea's Foreign Minister Kang Kyung Wha called on North Korea to take \"visible, concrete and substantial\" steps towards denuclearization if it wanted to ease the current sanction regimes. Earlier, North Korea's Deputy Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui had warned Washington of an \"undesirable outcome\" if it did not adjust its stance on economic sanctions.\n(https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/ausland/nordkorea-testet-neue-raketenwerfer-16171220.html)  These latest developments seem to support the argument I've made it in my original forecast, pointing to the re-escalating rhetoric within the conflict, which in turn reduces the chances of a visit of Kim in Seoul. However, I do not see these tendencies as strong enough, yet, to reduce the original stated likelihood of 20%.

However, the summit in Vietnam did not end in a signed deal between the US and North Korea mainly due to the request from North Korean side that the exchange for the nuclear program removal should be lifting of all sanctions, not just some. The risk that prevents the US from accepting such step is the risk of North Korea simply freezing the missile program which in itself contains multiple regional and global security risks. And this risk has somehow realized yesterday with news breaking that Kim Jong Un was supervising the first missile test since 2017. It was a solid fuel SRBM with multiple projectiles directed towards Japan signaling the end of the NK's nuclear coma. The response from US was sensitive with Trump insisting in a tweet that a deal between the US and North Korea is possible. A very diplomatic move but also quite mild having in mind the historic account of responses Trump usually takes when it comes to other rogue states or states that do not comply with the American set rules. Therefore, it could be seen that the US is willing to set a deal, however South Korea is concerned according to official statements due to the difference between nuclear freeze and nuclear program dismantle. Therefore, having in mind the now unstable and still evolving activities between the US, North Korea and South Korea, it seems that it is not impossible, but the chances are relatively low in the temporal framework set up by the question. The prospects for Kim Jong Un visiting Seoul after October 2019 are much more optimistic. Some side notes: Trump is acting mild because setting up a deal with NK would be a huge win, regionally and globally.\nFrom the other side regionally there are multiple problems involving China - if China plays along with the US and puts pressure on NK, the NK case could be a way for the two trade almost enemies to sit from the same side of the table. \nChinese involvement, therefore, is also crucial in terms of dealing with North Korea's nuclear behaviour and in ameliorating the chances and making it more probable for Kim Jong un to visit Seoul before the 1st October 2019.

Reports do add that it would be enticing for him to go, seeing as he would be the first North Korean leader to visit the South. Additionally, talks with South Korea could also result in more economic stimulation for North Korea. Nonetheless, my very slim probability is due to his recent missile testing activity as of the beginning of May, 2019. Sure, these tests were reported as being short range tests and North Korea is really only restricted by creating long range missiles. But a BBC report noted that North Korea is still working with radioactive material. According to the report, \"The country claims it has developed a nuclear bomb small enough to fit on a long-range missile, as well as ballistic missiles that could potentially reach the mainland US\" (BBC, 4 May 2019). While this isn't really \"new news,\" it still shows that Kim Jong Un is not particularly interested in following US and South Korean demands at the moment and is willing to still \"show off\" what tactics he has to work with.  https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-48158880\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/world/asia/south-korea-north-korea-trump-kim-summit.html"], [176, "2019-05-06T00:13:03Z", [0.0], "CNN has a pretty good report:\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2019/05/05/politics/north-korea-missile-launch-image/index.html\nA new satellite image obtained by CNN shows the smoke trail of a Friday rocket launch by North Korea that is likely a short-range missile, according to the group that analyzed the picture. \"The location of the launch, the thick, smoky appearance of the exhaust and the fact that there is only one rocket trail all suggest this was the short-range ballistic missile that North Korea showed in its propaganda,\" said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute.\nThe Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey provided CNN with two images of the smoke trail. The South Korean view from Pyongyang:\nIn particular, Kim warned:  \u201cIt is important to understand before it becomes too late that it will be hard to expect any progress in the north-south ties and any result of peace and prosperity as long as the war-like south Korean military forces are left intact in their disguised persistent hostile acts including the resumption of the joint military exercises with the U.S. in other codenames, though they were agreed to be stopped\u2026\u201d  Following up Kim\u2019s warnings, the CPRC statement was both at a higher level and tougher than the North\u2019s comment on South Korean military activities over the past year. It was obviously meant to be taken seriously in Seoul. The South\u2019s claim that the MRL drill violated the spirit of the inter-Korean agreements will undoubtedly draw a horse laugh from Pyongyang, which had noted in the CPRC statement that, \u201cWhatever steps we take, the south Korean authorities can never make any complaint, and if they cavil at, that will render the issue and the situation further complicated to let it go out of control.\u201d  There may still be an escalation on the North\u2019s part aimed more clearly and directly at the US, for example the sort of multiple Nodong missile launches that were carried out in 2017. Such a move would stay just within Kim\u2019s pledge not to further test intermediate or long-range missiles, but unmistakably signal a serious deterioration in the atmosphere for US-DPRK talks.

As Trump has had two summits with North Korea, it has pulled away from the efforts of President Moon to have more of a relationship between the Koreas and further and foster inter-Korea economic relations. However, with North Korea's unwillingness to denuclearize and stop the furthering of their nuclear program still creates a large wedge between the two Korea's. The lack of effort by the North Koreans to denuclearize and foster a more peaceful mentality between the Koreas, further supports his lack of care to better the relationship with South Korea, especially such a historic move like visiting Seoul. Until we see steps by North Korea to even show interest in a better relationship with South Korea, such as denuclearization, it is unlikely we will see a historic visit to Seoul by October.  https://www.npr.org/2019/03/04/700173356/why-the-second-u-s-north-korea-summit-dealt-a-setback-to-south-koreas-plans "], [72719, "2019-04-28T17:47:15Z", [0.85], ""], [60723, "2019-04-28T15:50:20Z", [0.15], "Kim and Trump bromance is leading to nothing beyond some excellent photos.

Visiting Seoul for the first time is of fundamental and symbolic meaning. The (future?) visit should be understood as a testimony of a strong political commitment to openness and cooperation with South Korea, in my opinion.  The assumption for this forecast is that Kim Jong Un will visit Seoul when North Korea will be at a place where the State trusts the rest of the world, resulting in being ready to compromise with its neighbour and being ready to fully show credentials, using the visit in Seoul \u2014 the State capital and not simply a demilitarized zone \u2014 as a symbol of this state of mind. \nPut differently, I find it unlikely that Kim Jung Un will bother to initiate a visit in Seoul \u2014 initiating such a historic with the media etc. \u2014 in a context where Pyongyang is not ready to write a new page with its neighbour (e.g economic cooperation with South Korea).  Key to the future perspectives between Pyongyang and Seoul, are the current denuclearization discussions between Trump and Kim Jung Un, with Moon Jae-in as the negotiator in between. The nuclear matter between the US and North Korea is central to the denuclearization perspectives of the Korean peninsula, hence, the promises for peace between the two Koreas. In other words, the current denuclearization discussions between the US and North Korea will determine the future perspectives between the two Koreas i.e meeting in Seoul.  Thereby, I think the denuclearization issue appears as a good indicator on which to base the forecast at hand, allowing us to know where the current discussions are going (which scenario)  If Moon Jae-in succeeds in bringing Trump and Kim Jong Un to an agreement, one could expect that President Moon will gain an important legitimacy in the eyes of the North Korean leader, facilitating a  significant breakthrough in relations between the two Koreas i.e meeting in Seoul and potential start of economic cooperation https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/world/asia/south-korea-north-korea-trump-kim-summit.html. This is the ideal scenario that we were expecting since the first meeting between Trump and Kim Jong Un, followed by the historical meeting of the two Korean leaders in 2018.  Nevertheless, in the face of the current stage of the denuclearization discussions, I find it unlikely that the  nuclear issue will be resolved in the following months. For instance, the last summit in Hanoi, Vietnam did not bring Trump and Kim Jong Un to a deal. The discussions seem to witness a thorough discrepancy. Several factors are blocking the progress of the \u2014 potential \u2014 agreement e.g US sanctions on NK; US. military presence in South Korea (an important pressure felt by Pyongyang) hindering North Korea\u2019s efforts to cancel all its nuclear activities\u2026 Mutual trust is not yet on the agenda; long years of deterrence  are struggling to make room for a new relationship between the US and NK. \nFurthermore, taking into account the complexity of the case, Trump has stated not being in a rush. For instance, the US President will soon be particularly focusing on his re-election campaign, thus moving away from his ongoing negotiations in international affairs.  To sum up, I believe that Kim Jong Un will visit Seoul once the issue with the US is solved, with a positive outcome. However, this is not to be expected before 1 October 2019, taking into account the current stage of the discussions on denuclearization.  https://www.npr.org/2019/03/04/700173356/why-the-second-u-s-north-korea-summit-dealt-a-setback-to-south-koreas-plans\nhttps://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2019/02/28/sommet-de-hanoi-aucun-accord-entre-donald-trump-et-kim-jong-un_5429305_3210.html\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/world/asia/south-korea-north-korea-trump-kim-summit.html"], [71340, "2019-04-28T08:01:07Z", [0.1], ""], [172, "2019-04-27T21:49:49Z", [0.35], ""], [48085, "2019-04-27T20:19:49Z", [0.14], ""], [72705, "2019-04-27T17:07:14Z", [0.05], ""], [42472, "2019-04-27T15:28:20Z", [0.0], ""], [67420, "2019-04-27T13:14:19Z", [0.2], "Base line or rather point of departure for the forecast at hand are the summit meetings between the heads of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRD) and the German Democratic Republic (GDR), respectively. This comparison is made due to several similarities. First, in both cases former united nations were separated after World War II. Consequently, as a second similarity, both cases share a certain form of system competition with both the BRD and South Korea having won this competition. While North Korea is struggling, both in terms of economical parameters, as well as international standing, South Korea has developed into a stable, mature democracy. As a modern industrial country, it belongs to the countries with higher incomes and is a member of the OECD and G20, among others (https://www.swp-berlin.org/fileadmin/contents/products/research_papers/2018RP12_hlp_mro_eds.pdf#page=12). Thus, it does not come as a surprise that both cases also share the same refugee movement from east to west and north to south, respectively (https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/nord-und-suedkorea-die-euphorie-ist-der-realitaet-gewichen.724.de.html?dram:article_id=447159). Another crucial similarity touches upon the reconciliation processes or rather attempts. Even though both BRD and South Korean societies were/are majority-wise in favor of the reconciliation, they were/are still divided. Nevertheless, both the BRD and South Korea kept pushing the reconciliation process. Thereby, both reconciliation processes experienced ups and downs ((https://www.swp-berlin.org/fileadmin/contents/products/research_papers/2018RP12_hlp_mro_eds.pdf#page=12).  In the German case: Only in 1970, 25 years after the division of Germany, there have been a first visit of a BRD chancellor in the GDR as part of its reconciliations strategy - not even meeting, then head of state Walter Ulbricht. Despite big symbolic gestures and euphoria for the reconciliation process, it took 11 years more until the next summit meeting. In 1981, again a BRD chancellor visited the GDR, this time meeting with its GDR counterpart. The expansion of mutual relations was decided. However, after the summit relations cold down again and it took 6 years more until, for the first time, a GDR head of state visited the BRD in 1987 (http://www.zeitklicks.de/ddr/zeitklicks/zeit/politik/die-beiden-deutschen-staaten/gipfeltreffen/http://www.zeitklicks.de/ddr/zeitklicks/zeit/politik/die-beiden-deutschen-staaten/gipfeltreffen/). The major take away of this point of departure with regard to the forecast at hand is to not underestimate the time reconciliation processes need. It took more than 17 years after the first visit of BRD chancellor in the GDR for its counterpart to return the visit. Thus, according to this baseline it seems highly unlikely that Kim will visit Seoul before October 1, 2019.  However, it is worth taking a closer look into the context of the inner-Korean reconciliation process as well. Only on April 27, 2018 North Korean head of state Kim met South Korean President Moon at the inner-Korean border strip in Panmunjom  for the first time. As the first German meeting huge symbolic gestures were exchanged. On June 1, a summit meeting between Kim and Trump took place which equally promoted further hope of a soon reconciliation. In September, Moon finally visited North Korea, the first visit of a south Korean political since 11 years (https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/nord-und-suedkorea-die-euphorie-ist-der-realitaet-gewichen.724.de.html?dram:article_id=447159). However, the second meeting between Trump and Kim in February 2019 perfectly illustrated how hopes shouldn\u2019t get too high. The dispute over the complete denuclearization of North Korea before sanctions would be left lead to a quick end of the meeting. Since then rhetoric has armed up again and Kim met Russian president Putin, instead of the Trump administration (https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-48047279). Despite South Korean moderation attempts, a visit of Kim in Seoul gets less likely this way. Not only because South Korea itself maintains a sanction regime against North Korea but also because - from a North Korean point of view - it could undermine its negotiating position in the bargaining with the US.  To sum up, as well as the chosen baseline the contextual factors leave little hope for a visit of Kim in Seoul before October 1, 2019.

On the other hand, Kim needs to establish some reliable and solid partnerships via diplomat exchange in order to survive until the next US-North Korea meeting can be arranged.  The recent Kim-Putin meeting indicates North Korea\u2019s willingness to seeking soft approach via diplomatic exchange with its potential allies, and the dialogue with the U.S. is still open simultaneously. Although Russia is not able to change the UN sanctions momentarily, if Russia could lax about the implementing sanction, that would help North Korea\u2019s economic sphere to stay at a self-sufficiency level. Before UN sanctions finally lift, Russia\u2019s support will play a significant role in North Korea, and this image also illustrated that North Korea not only heavily lean on China solely.  Despite there is less room for South Korea to insert its effort to persuade the U.S. lift sanction bar. It seems necessary for inter-Korea to keep posting a tied relationship to soften the nuke tension around the peninsula. On the other hand, South Korea could, or may not, provide economic support from the side to help North Korea before the next dialogue with Trump, if he still sits in the White House before the third meeting arranged.

However, Kim\u2019s speech revealed some interesting insights into the shape of domestic politics and the economy that are worth exploring. The speech was framed within the successes of last year. The 2013 Byungjin Line of promoting two fronts\u2014economy and a nuclear deterrent\u2014simultaneously had finally been delivered. The country lives under the protective umbrella of its nuclear deterrent and can turn its focus to the \u201chigher goal\u201d of economic construction. Kim acknowledged that challenges to this domestic agenda certainly exist, noting especially the misallocation of labor, lack of expertise and poor productivity. In his speech, he instructed a reallocation of labor and resources, both for the military and the Party, to start to address these barriers to success.

I think that's overconfident. Kim and Moon have not only had one summit already [1], but they arranged a second one in a matter of weeks [2] when the need arose (negotiations regarding US-NK summit, which had soured for a bit). Then, less than 4 months later, Moon went to Pyongyang for a third summit [3]. The obstacles that I could see to this meeting are: (1) timeframe too short; (2) security concerns for Kim; (3) Kim doesn't want to be perceived as compromising more than his opponents. My reading of the US/SK/NK drama is that NK tends to regard SK as a separate entity from the US, especially with the new liberal govt. So for (3), whatever is going on with the US, the fact that Moon went to Pyongyang first suggests to me that Kim would not \"lose face\" by going to Seoul. (Plus, currently US/NK are back on friendly terms with talk of a third summit. The friendliness level is very noisy/oscillating in the short term but I believe is trending upwards, as it is in the interest of both parties' govts.) As for (1), remember that they had an impromptu summit organized in less than 30 days [1,2]. I think it's fair to say that NK is SK's #1 priority, and SK is at least NK's #3 priority (after US and China), so both would put aside most other concerns to make a meeting happen if one was agreed upon. Finally, for (2), which might also impact timeframes: there are probably lots of people in SK that would like to see Kim Jeong-Eun dead. So ensuring his safety would be harder than it was for meetings in Pyongyang or the DMZ. Then again, they managed to ensure his safety in Singapore and Hanoi --- the former a straight-up ally of the US, and the latter having reasonably good relations with the US. The train trip to Hanoi is very long, whereas Seoul is only ~40km from the NK border. Finally, Seoul is again very close to the border, so NK can retaliate very effectively if KJU is taken out; hence it is in SK's every interest to keep him safe. My last consideration is that it was rumored that KJU would visit Seoul in Dec 2018 [4]. The source is apparently someone who was present for the Sep 2018 summit. While that hasn't happened, a number of other lower-stakes steps have [5], notably (in my non-expert opinion) the \"Opening of Inter-Korean Liaison Office\", \"Ratification of Summit Agreements\", and \"Buffer, No-Fly, and Peace Zones Established\". Given all this, I want to say there's at least a 75% chance KJU/MJI meet before Oct 2019. (Moon is pushing for another summit.) The question is, do they meet in Seoul? They've met in the DMZ twice already, once on each side of it, for symbolism I suppose. Then once in Pyongyang. I suppose they could meet in the DMZ again, but Seoul makes more sense. And in the end, it's not like meeting in Seoul binds KJU in any way. So I want to say 2/3 chance the meeting is in Seoul. That gives 50%. If by early Sep there has been no announcement I will regard NO as the certain outcome. There are about 20 weeks till then, so I will reduce by 5% every two weeks if no announcement comes.

Why it will happen?\nSince the Korea War (1950-1953), the two Asian countries have suffered periods of tensions alternated with periods of quietness, also in relation to their allied powers\u2019 decisions (Russia, China, US). With the death of the former president Kim Jong-il, his son Kim Jong-un took office (2011) and started a new policy for the country.\nSince its establishment, he has pursued an aggressive policy investing on atomic programme, already started by its predecessors. Because of its numerous missiles tests he has received accusations and critics from the entire international community, but Kim goal was keep going with the training and make its enemies aware of the atomic power that North Korea (NK) was becoming. Indeed, iin 2017 the international community remained surprised by the technological advance developed during Kim regime, making NK disposable of intercontinental missiles able to get to the American soil. Such a behaviour created tension principally with South Korea (SK) and US. Under the guidance of president Park, SK announced retirement by some cooperation programmes, for example, closing the military base in Kaesong, supposed to be managed by both Koreas. US instead increase its attendance in the area and reinforce the collaboration with SK, plus engaged a threats war against NK which can be resume in \u201cwho had the most powerful nuclear tool\u201d. In addition, Kim often reacts in front of any proof of alliance between US and SK, like during joint military trainings, when he revoked the armistice signed in 1953. In spite of challenging external actors all the time, I believe that this was just the first part of a more forward-looking strategy to scare the enemies. Indeed, NK is extremely isolated, poor, surviving only thanks to humanitarian aids, without allies (except for China, even if even it has condemned NK actions). Therefore, in order to create some room for manoeuvre for negotiating au pair with the other states, Kim decided to develop its only ace in the hole, the nuclear weapons. Indeed, after the peak of tensions in the beginning of 2017, the relations between US, NK and SK have slowly started to improve. Is not in the interest of anyone, neither of NK, to engage a devastating war. \nIn addition, since the start of his term in office, the North Korean leader announced its intention of implementing double track policy (byungjin): the first concern is achieving the status of nuclear power, as a deterrent in foreign policy, the second one is developing economy and prosperity, even opening to external markets.\nSome signs of distension have been the participation of NK at 2018 Olympic Games, or the symbolic cross by both the leader of the wall in Panmunjom village, on the 38\u00b0 parallel, which divides NK from SK. In particular this last meeting (April 2018) has been described as the first real step towards peace after decades of diplomatic ups and downs. These rapprochements make more realistic the path of denuclearization, and this is what Trump wanted to obtain during the summit in Vietnam in the end of last February. Also, Kim has shown his predisposition in finally signed the end of Korean war, which end has never been officially declared. This move would finally open the NK to some external markets, trading with China, SK and some Asian countries. Besides, China would be happy for a reduced presence of US on the Asian territories and SK president would be remembered as the one that reached the peace.\nIt\u2019s also true that the past history is full of very precarious situations and diplomatic setbacks, compared to which Hanoi doesn't look that bad. Also, at the last point, I would take in account that, in spite of divergences about economy, politics, social system and ideology, the two Korea come from the same cultural background (5000 years of history as one unique country can\u2019t disappear). So, I think that this common ground can facilitate a bit the future possible negotiations, in order to understand the reasons behind some requests from each side. Why not before 1 October 2019?\nThe described scenario is still far to reach. During the Hanoi summit between Trump and Kim, no real concrete solution about denuclearization has been reached, which instead was strongly expected by Moon, the current SK president. A visit in Seoul would be the first-ever visit to the South by a North Korean leader (Kim in 2018 promised to do that), is now likely to be put on hold. Indeed, I don\u2019t expect such a meaningful meeting planned without some evidences of Kim\u2019s intentions in denuclearize its country,  because random declarations (like the ones announced in 2018) are not enough.\nAlso, denuclearization is quite unlikely to happen right after the NK has achieved the power it was looking forward. Is not a case that last month, Mr. Trump\u2019s director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, told Congress that North Korea was \u201cunlikely to completely give up its nuclear weapons and production capability because its leaders ultimately view nuclear weapons as critical to regime survival.\u201d The 3 states still have to figure out and bargain on what means starting a denuclearization, and I don\u2019t expect any meeting in Seoul before it\u2019s made clear.\nMoreover, there are factors as the next SK presidential elections, which do not guarantee the prosecution of Moon policy. The current president, from the left-wing, became famous for its effort in reaching an agreement with the NK and the ambitious plan of a concrete cooperation, but maybe the next one will pursue another policy. Also, such a delicate meeting would be probably planned carefully and not in hurry during the last period of Moon\u2019s term, leaving such a burden for the next charger.\nHowever, I take in account the pressures of ther countries like US and China. US would push for a meeting in Seoul considering that accomplishing this purpose Trump could claim to be the architect of the peace between the two Koreas (translated: prestige useful for 2020 US elections). https://www.lindro.it/corea-del-nord-usa-un-accordo-che-sha-da-fare/#prettyPhoto\nhttp://www.occhidellaguerra.it/i-rapporti-tra-corea-del-sud-e-corea-del-nord-nel-corso-del-tempo/\nhttps://ilmanifesto.it/kim-e-moon-solo-un-anno-fa-era-una-pace-impensabile/\nhttps://www.corriere.it/esteri/18_aprile_27/storico-incontro-corea-sud-nord-moon-kim-sono-felice-incontrarti-ff529d74-49ae-11e8-91c2-712f6a8efc34.shtml "], [70219, "2019-04-12T09:24:52Z", [0.0], ""], [70176, "2019-04-12T06:07:11Z", [0.0], ""], [70171, "2019-04-12T05:49:56Z", [1.0], ""], [70166, "2019-04-12T05:17:05Z", [0.0], ""], [70162, "2019-04-12T04:53:46Z", [0.0], ""], [70148, "2019-04-12T03:35:59Z", [0.15], "Unlikely to happen given current news"], [70137, "2019-04-12T02:42:45Z", [0.08], ""], [70134, "2019-04-12T02:33:04Z", [0.85], "He has been educated in a western society an fears trump, adapting will be a survivor trait and soul is part of the plan.

He also defined himself regret not having done that before.\n-\tLast year in this period (On April 27), Kim Jong-Un crossed the military line that divides the two Koreas, becoming the first North Korean leader since the end of the Korean War to do so. As you can see in the video (first link in the resources) the two leaders seemed like 2 old friend meeting after a long time. And while crossing the border hand in hand like a cute couple:  all kidding aside, this gives reasons for hope!  Following these considerations, the likelihood of the 2 leaders meeting in Seul in the future is quite high. However, one thing is what it will happen in the long run, another what will happen from now to October first. Such a historical meeting will be carefully planned before taking place. This not only because of the importance of the event but also because long planning and carefulness are intrinsic features of the Korean culture. Up to now, no formal negotiations (excluding random declarations from both sides) between the diplomacies of the two countries are taking place (unless it is happening in a secret way).\n\nA good date for the meeting could be the Liberation Day on August 15 where they commemorate Japan's acceptance of the Allies' terms of surrender in 1945 and the following liberation of Korea. As it is seen as a positive celebration in both centuries, it might give a good pretext to hold the meeting. However, South Korea is strongly tied with the US (full of military bases on its territory and protected in more than one occasion, especially during the war in 1950) and the last meeting with Trump and Kim Jong Un did not end as hoped. The same South Korean PM Moon defined the meeting as an unfortunate setback.  This, of course, does not mean that relationships are now going to be colder and colder. However, it might definitely slow down a bit the process, with South Korea less willing to welcome Jong -Un until he does not reach at least a memorandum of agreement for the process of denuclearization with South Korean biggest ally. Finally, PM Moon is now at the last year of his term, he might prefer to let this burden to the next president (although it might also be seen as an occasion to write history and thus be remembered, but I think the last meetings have already contributed enough to this).  Concluding, I think this meeting will happen but is more likely to happen after October. However, I have no reason to exclude it completely, especially since the common willing of both sides. Therefore, I assess a 20% chance.

In a rare letter to Seoul, Mr Kim said he wished to pursue peace between the countries and \"solve the issue of denuclearising the peninsula together\", a spokesman for Mr Moon said. Mr Kim also expressed \"much regret\" that he could not visit Seoul in 2018 (https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-46714299).

That said, South Korea is a historical US ally, and it's definetly foreseeable that North-South Korean relations will be influenced by US-North Korea talks about nuclear disarmament (for a way too detailed chronology, see https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/dprkchron whose sum up is that relations are going pretty well, eventhough there's still not a deal about disarmament for releif from economic sanctions).

It took 5 months to go from the first neutral-territory summit to Pyongyang, 3 months between the Pyongyang summit and the letter proposing Seoul talks.

Indeed, after nuclear tests in the North, Seoul proposed a meeting on January 9, 2018, which resulted in a North Korean delegation to the Winter Olympic Games in PyeongChang, South Korea, as well as the visit of the North Korean leader's sister, Kim Yo-Jong, first member of the North Dynasty to visit South Korea since 1953. Nevertheless, we still see the same promises, the same joint declarations, of prosperity and peace between the two states, whether in 2000, through the \"sunshine policy\" (policy of rapprochement and reconciliation of South Korea), with the opening of the Kumgang Mountains to South Korean tourists in communist territory and the inter-Korean industrial zone of Kaesong; or more recently with Trump and the North Korean leader meetings in Singapore and Hanoi, and Kim Jong Un's promise to come to Seoul before 2019 (which he did not do). Forecast:\nHence, we must not always take literally the North Korean claims, because nuclear is vital for the survival of the regime, and therefore denuclearization will always be impossible. North Korea's strategy is to juggle sanctions and their withdrawals, to raise enough economic resources to prepare for future waves. It should also be noted that the failure of the meeting in Hanoi between Trump and Kim Jong Un will surely mark a return to cold relations. Indeed, Trump demanded \"the complete elimination of their program of weapons of mass destruction\u00a0\u00bb. The United States does not want a \"progressive\" denuclearization of North Korea, but a total and rapid disarmament in exchange for a lifting of the sanctions, so it tends to backtrack, which is likely to encourage the North Korean leader not to visit Seoul. The momentum of rapprochement is lost, and the vicious circle starts again. Indeed, Satellites reveal that Pyongyang seems to have rebuilt a rocket test site it had promised to dismantle, and the official North Korean agency has openly \"blamed\" the Americans for the failure of the summit. Rockets launching site that North Korea had begun to dismantle as part of its rapprochement with the United States is again \"operational\" after being quickly rebuilt by Pyongyang, reported Thursday, March 7 experts.The Sohae site (or Tongchang-ri) is \"back to its normal operational status\" (Source: https: //www.france24.com/en/20190307-core-nord-lancement-fusees-nucleaire).\nIt should also be noted that there is a bias in the question. If there is a meeting between two countries with such an antagonist history, Seoul will obviously be not the right place. In the case of a meeting, they will choose a more quiet and secure place in South Korea (IF they meet in SK), rather than in a huge capital.\nSecondly, if they meet, it is more likely in a country than their home country (like for Israel-Palestine talks etc.).\nMoreover, North Korea still uses the South cynically for humanitarian and economic assistance (in case of famine in 2000, or severe floods in 2007), and when it comes to talking about denuclearization, South Korea is often excluded, in favor of the United States. North Korea for 2019 is likely to return to its hermit state, and so Kim Jong Un will not visit Seoul, even if that does not remain impossible in case of new favorable events."], [1333, "2019-03-29T18:23:52Z", [0.08], ""], [33124, "2019-03-29T13:46:40Z", [0.8], ""], [36801, "2019-03-28T19:37:12Z", [0.03], "I find it highly unlikely that Kim Jong Un would meet in Seoul, given the failure of the summit in Hanoi in February and that no prior meetings have ever taken place in Seoul.

It would show that Kim is so desperate for allies he is willing to go into what is for all intents and purposes enemy territory (as the Korean war has not officially ended).

It may happen later in the future, but given the current state of affairs, it does not seem to benefit Kim enough to take such a step.\n https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/28/white-house-trump-kim-meetings-change-of-schedule.html\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/u-s-drops-demand-full-accounting-n-korea-nuclear-program-n977251\n"], [31756, "2019-03-28T18:53:24Z", [0.0], ""], [67387, "2019-03-28T16:38:49Z", [0.1], ""], [42853, "2019-03-28T14:25:55Z", [0.01], ""], [30042, "2019-03-28T02:28:37Z", [0.01], ""], [35642, "2019-03-28T01:54:17Z", [0.0], ""], [172, "2019-03-28T01:51:27Z", [0.1], "Ok dropping down to 1 in 10.

Previous SK and NK meetings have occurred in Pyongyang and at the border. Kim Jong Un has consequently had two summits with the US, in Singapore and Hanoi. The latter of which broke down due to conflicting demands between NK and the USA. Moreover, South Korean intelligence shows North Korea has recently started to reconstruct nuclear missile installations, diverging from the cooperative narrative prior to Hanoi. I doubt that Kim Yong Un would want another Summit (Hanoi) that yields little substantial results due to the domestic image of \"more than human\" which he has to maintain. Despite this, Moon has built up rapport with Kim Yong Un, and has been asked by Trump to take a more active role following the collapse of Hanoi. Both SK and NK maintain that they want to continue talks with each other, regularly emphasizing the importance of inter-Korea summits. However, these talks are likely to be more of a lower level between government officials rather than heads of governments to continue bridging the large gap in demands that became clear in Hanoi. Because of successes of previous SK and NK summits, and a more recent commitment of NK to improve its economy I believe Kim Yong Un\u2019s visit to Seoul is in the books. However, this meeting is likely to signify a more significant breakthrough between the two nations. Therefore, I expect cooperation between NK and SK to continue on lower levels, potential meetings in border villages, before Kim Yong Un visits Seoul, something I believe is in the cards, however not before 1st of October. Breakthroughs in lower level negotiations can cause an expediated visit of Kim Yong Un to Seoul, but I deem it unlikely that this happens before October 1st.  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/30/kim-jong-un-vows-to-meet-south-koreas-leader-frequently-in-2019\nhttps://thediplomat.com/2019/01/what-to-expect-in-inter-korean-relations-in-2019/\nhttps://thediplomat.com/2019/03/first-impressions-understanding-what-happened-at-the-us-north-korea-summit-in-hanoi/\nhttps://www.vietnamnews.net/news/259962568/us-and-south-korea-study-next-steps-in-relation-to-north-korea\n"], [1333, "2019-03-26T15:56:36Z", [0.09], ""], [15196, "2019-03-26T13:08:49Z", [0.2], ""], [68140, "2019-03-26T12:38:13Z", [0.02], "The recent talks with the US did not go as well as planned.

Around 11m North Koreans, more than two-fifths of the population, are malnourished. Roughly as many have no access to clean drinking water. (In rural areas the percentage is much higher.) On March 6th the UN reported that total crop production fell to less than 5m tonnes last year, a 9% drop from 2017 and the lowest level in a decade. The situation is likely to worsen this year, as a summer of extreme heat and an autumn of floods and typhoons was followed by a lack of rain during the winter planting season. Even now, reckons the UN, nearly 4m people are in need of emergency aid.\" [2] Kim needs sanctions uplifted. He is bluffing with nukes but US seems to be firm in that partial denuclearisation is not enough. Visiting Seoul and coming back with a trade deal is still less likely than not, but it would be a smart (IMHO) move to gain the earlier while keeping his nuclear insurance. An probably the US will not be clear about it. After all, Trump \"likes Chairman Kim\" [1].
