""], [578, "2020-01-13T20:15:28Z", [0.01], "Lets examine the facts before forecasting this question. In December 2017, the total assets managed by the Chilean private AFPs are US$ 211 billion (1).  The AFPs registered a earning of US$197 million for the first quarter in 2019 (2).  This extrapolates to about US$800 million per year.  This results in roughly 0.4% of the total assets (I know I am mixing the years but the general conclusion should not change much).  It does not appear to be excessive.  This percentage is also in line with what is reported in an OECD report (3) - the Chilean pension fund fee is 0.6% of the salary. In 2017, the fund with the highest risk profile, fund A, performed the best over the 12 months, generating returns of 15.44% (1).   The worst performing fund was the most conservative, fund E, which generated returns of 1.01%. Fund C, with an intermediate risk level, generated returns of 7.51%.  These are respectable performances. It appears that the low pension in Chile is not due to excessive fees or poor performance.  Low contributions are frequently cited as the cause of the low pension payouts.  Reducing fees (in fact, removal of all fees) will not make significant increases in pension payouts.  However, government policies are frequently based on politics and not rational assessment of facts.  There is a small chance that this is going to happen.
