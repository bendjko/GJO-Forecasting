In the coming weeks, the largest events that could potentially swing FB's stock price from a sector's perspective are earnings releases on 7/29, as well as big tech's antitrust investigation by Congress. I'd expect earnings to be much more of a wild card, as the latter has been talked about since early this year, and results are general inconclusive, especially given how slow Congress moves on issues. The largest story here is how ad boycotting has affected Facebook during Q2, and if that's enough for investors to be worried about the long-term impact on Facebook's stock price.

Performing the calculations leaves me with an approximated distribution of: 4, 44, 47, 5, 0. The methods of backtracking from options prices fails to fully take into account potential macroeconomic trends or perform any strict fundamental analysis of Facebook's pricing. With the announced delay of Facebook's earning date, we have a D-Day of sorts on July 30th as FAANG as a whole release their earnings. SNAP and Twitter, for instance, provides a market outlook on overall sentiment post-earnings as they both beat their expected EPS.  The potential second wave of COVID-19 and the increased redirection of advertising spend towards alternate clients compared to FAANG likely has some implication on the FB pricing.

Just today, FB announced they are postponing their Q2 announcement by a day to allow Zuckerberg to appear before a Congressional hearing. I think this delay, combined with residual volatility from earnings trickling into the week of August 5th, flattens the middle part of the distribution.

This gives a log-return volatility of about 10.75% over the 10-day time period from now to August 5. Given the current stock price of Facebook sits in between two buckets, we should also have a roughly symmetrical distribution. Applying the given volatilities, a brownian motion should have about a 80% chane of staying within the $200-260 bands. I also biased my probabilities upwards as the Fed's continued buying and a new fiscal stimulus bill seem to cap downside on stocks in general, and FAANG sentiment seems to have barely slowed, even on worse than expected earnings from Netflix.

There are a few important events to highlight that will strongly influence Facebook stock. On 7/29, after market close, FB will release earnings. EPS expectations are lower that any of the past four quarters, due to new headwinds facing adverting revenues. The company has been subject to an advertiser boycott for not policing the veracity of content on the platform more closely, and lack of removing hate speech. Earnings will likely have a large impact on whether or not the stock price is up or down on the time interval considered.  Currently, we are in the midst of earnings season. Twitter reports earnings on 7/23. Snap reports on 7/21. Apple and Amazon report on 7/30. These are all events that could affect the stock price of FB, positively or negative depending on if industry trends are elucidated.  Finally, the federal reserve will report Q2 GDP figures on 7/30. This is likely to have a large impact on all equities. The median forecast is currently -31% (according to marketwatch) compared to the same quarter last year. This will potentially depress stocks further as retail investors respond to this news. FB stock closed at $240.86 on July 7. Today, FB closed at $245.42. There are 12 remaining trading days before August 5th. From implied volatility in options prices, we can calculate and model the distribution of predicted FB prices by the market. The August 7th 245 straddle is trading at $23.10, (this accounts for 14 trading days, not 12). A fine estimate is that the straddle at the current stock price for expiry on 8/5 would be trading at about $20. (In 50% of cases, the stock price would remain within $20 from the stock price). We can approximate the distribution of FB stock by using options expiring on 8/7. From these options, implied volatility in FB stock from now until Aug 7th is 54.73% annually. There are 12 trading days inclusive of the 5th of August. Implied volatility over the next 12 trading days can be calculated as Vol = 54.7% / sqrt(252/12) = 12% So we can expect that the distribution of FB prices is going to be normal with a mean of $245.42 and a std of 12% or $30. With this insight, a prediction can be made. <200 : 6%\n200-230: 24%\n230-260: 39%\n260-290: 25%\n290< : 6%"], [92879, "2020-07-21T01:42:47Z", [0.0, 0.17, 0.56, 0.22, 0.05], "We can first look at the extreme cases. Facebook is currently trading at 245.42 with 12 trading days left. The world has pretty much accepted Coronavirus, and thus we do not expect any drastic falls  so we can rule 200 with probability 0. Now, we must concern the two key events that could affect the Facebook price; the earnings on July 29 and the ongoing agenda of banning political/un-fact checked ads.  The earnings typically does not move the price more than 10%, but we must account for a potential 10% move in either direction. Furthermore, the facebook ad ban and hearings have not had a huge impact on the price, as I have spoke to several domain experts and looked at the price. We can now look at the chance of a price over $290, this can happen if they beat earnings and go up (18/31) times, and trend upward after and before. To quantify this, I would put the chance at about 5%. We also know that most likely the price will be around the current price, so we can set that to the highest probability.

I saw how others used option prices in their forecasts and wanted to suggest an improvement on that method.  The price of a call spread divided by the difference in strikes is roughly equal to the probability that the call spread expires in the money.  (Think about the limiting case as the difference in strikes goes to 0 to see why\u2014in this limit it is exactly true).  This can be used to back out a market-implied CDF for the stock price at expiration.  I used option prices in the Aug 7 weekly expiration to find these values using the closest available strikes.  I used the call spreads with boundaries at the relevant stock prices, and took the average of the two implied probabilities to back out what the implied probability would be very roughly for a call spread centered on the relevant value.   I think that this distribution is a fairly good \"base rate\" for the distribution on Aug 5.  However, there are a couple of things to consider.  First and most obvious is that there are two days between the end of this question and the expiration of the weekly options.  As compared with other approaches others have taken using monthly options however, we don't have to make any assumptions about earnings or interpolate across an earnings event.  If there are any events expected on the 6th or 7th, however, it could be important to take these into account and potentially adjust option prices accordingly.  If anyone knows of any, let me know and we can try to make this adjustment. As far as any other adjustments to these values go, I am fairly confident that the market collectively knows much more about factors affecting Facebook's stock price in the coming weeks than I do, so I don't think there is anything for me to gain by adjusting this base rate to include my own view.

Earnings results, especially surprises relative to analyst estimates, have largely driven price moves in the week following past announcements.  However, Facebook's beta (correlation) to the wider market performance is 1.2 (5 year monthly), and has in fact increased recently, as market stress has led to more correlation between stocks. So, while earnings may have driven returns in the past, macro factors such as the expected uptick in new cases over the next few weeks may be more/just as important.

The major driver for Facebook stock is COVID-19. As daily new cases continuously achieve daily record, and with fed providing enough liquidity to prevent systematic failure, tech companies like Facebook/Google/Amazon benefit greatly. Right now, I believe it is similar to April/May 2020, where value of technology companies was gradually discovered by the market.  Factors that can bring down the price may include bad earning news for the company, scandals, systematic liquidity issues, etc. However, most of these risks have been handled (e.g. systematic liquidity by FED) or absorbed by the market.

While not incredibly informative, I begin by heuristically examining the average change in Facebook\u2019s stock price over four week periods during the past two years. We usually see 2-3% price increases. I do not think the advertiser boycott is going to remain a significant issue in the coming weeks as (a) brands are responding to increased public awareness which fades quickly and (b) Facebook\u2019s stock price has gained over the past years despite similar pressure from regulatory bodies (for tax and anti-competitive practices). In my mind, the earnings report presents a much more difficult problem. Broadly speaking, stock prices react to earnings relative to expectation as opposed to in absolute terms. Hence, it is usually not sufficient to argue about stock price moves based on the public analyst expectation alone. In addition, looking at the four most recent earnings releases, Facebook\u2019s stock price has only returned to pre-earnings levels within the subsequent week once. (The forecast similarly closes one week after earnings.) This indicates that the result of the forecast could be influenced significantly by the earnings results. All things considered, my forecast remains primarily in line with the historical changes in Facebook\u2019s stock price. However, I would allocate more probability to Facebook\u2019s stock decreasing. This is solely due to the potential of an earnings miss.

As of now, there is no indication of a dividend by August 5. Given the way the question's answer is asked above, I thought it might be a good idea to look at option prices with the strikes corresponding to the bounds above. For example, I could look at a $230 strike put option to estimate the probability that FB price goes below $230. The current price of a July 17 230 put is around $1.47, and the price of an Aug 21 230 put is around $9.45. I don't know the ins and outs of Black Scholes yet, so I can't get an exact volatility measure of some sort (that could be a helpful calculation if someone is skilled in Black Scholes). However, given the lack of a dividend, it's fair to say that a hypothetical Aug 5 230 put would be priced between $1.47 and $9.45. For now, I'll just do a weighted average (by # of business days) of the two dates' options to get 13/25*$1.47 + 12/25*$9.45=$5.300. Likewise, I can get a value of a hypothetical Aug 5 260 option as 13/25*$0.70+12/25*$7.50=$3.964. Doing the same for $200, $290 gives a summary below: Hypothetical Aug5 $200 put: $1.325\nHypothetical Aug5 $230 put: $5.300\nHypothetical Aug5 $260 call: $3.964\nHypothetical Aug5 $290 call: $0.805 We get that the value of $230put-$200put is $3.975 and the value of $260call-$290call is $3.159. As a very rough approximation, we can guess that these prices are rough proportions of percent within each range (when I have more time to think about this later, I imagine I'll change this logic). For these ratios to be usable, I must also estimate the probability that the price lies within the $230-$260 range. I can estimate this by taking two more Hypothetical Aug5 calls and puts: Hypothetical Aug5 $260 put: $21.840\nHypothetical Aug5 $230 call: $17.608 Using these values to estimate our $230-$260 range gives $21.840-5.300=$16.54 or $17.608-$3.964=$13.644. Ideally these would give the same value, but so many assumptions and estimates went in, we can give our \"price\" to the $230-$260 range as the average: $15.092. Then our prices for each range are:\nLess than 200: $1.325\nBetween 200, 230: $3.975\nBetween 230, 260: $15.092\nBetween 260, 290: $3.159\nAbove 290: $0.805 Scaling these into percents gives:\nLess than 200: 5%\nBetween 200, 230: 17%\nBetween 230, 260: 62%\nBetween 260, 290: 13%\nAbove 290: 3% This is just a crude initial estimate, and will need to be updated to be both more precise and to update given future options prices.\n"], [87943, "2020-07-10T16:43:24Z", [0.0, 0.2, 0.75, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [13306, "2020-07-10T16:18:26Z", [0.1, 0.33, 0.55, 0.02, 0.0], ""], [66692, "2020-07-10T16:17:08Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.7, 0.2, 0.0], ""], [66692, "2020-07-10T16:15:56Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.7, 0.15, 0.05], ""], [66692, "2020-07-10T16:15:27Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.6, 0.25, 0.05], ""], [691, "2020-07-10T15:59:20Z", [0.0, 0.12, 0.83, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [93423, "2020-07-10T15:54:08Z", [0.1, 0.15, 0.6, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [93358, "2020-07-10T14:40:53Z", [0.0, 0.2, 0.75, 0.05, 0.0], "https://www.barrons.com/articles/facebook-advertising-boycott-has-its-limits-adl-and-color-of-change-say-51594329096"], [89371, "2020-07-10T14:23:44Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.9, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [88783, "2020-07-10T13:32:53Z", [0.02, 0.18, 0.51, 0.23, 0.06], ""], [57778, "2020-07-10T11:36:30Z", [0.02, 0.2, 0.53, 0.21, 0.04], ""], [27661, "2020-07-10T09:29:22Z", [0.0, 0.35, 0.65, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [20156, "2020-07-10T08:39:47Z", [0.05, 0.2, 0.6, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [88766, "2020-07-10T08:20:30Z", [0.0, 0.33, 0.67, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [61367, "2020-07-10T07:40:20Z", [0.0, 0.04, 0.8, 0.12, 0.04], ""], [67232, "2020-07-10T07:05:19Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.8, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [87440, "2020-07-10T00:04:55Z", [0.05, 0.35, 0.5, 0.1, 0.0], "Election season"], [86069, "2020-07-09T22:16:55Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.96, 0.03, 0.0], ""], [14027, "2020-07-09T20:04:14Z", [0.03, 0.23, 0.59, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [88010, "2020-07-09T19:09:26Z", [0.05, 0.4, 0.51, 0.03, 0.01], ""], [90237, "2020-07-09T19:08:10Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.75, 0.0], ""], [691, "2020-07-09T18:53:22Z", [0.0, 0.16, 0.79, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2020-07-09T18:10:06Z", [0.05, 0.15, 0.75, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2020-07-09T18:07:45Z", [0.05, 0.15, 0.65, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [93423, "2020-07-09T18:01:40Z", [0.1, 0.05, 0.7, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [38094, "2020-07-09T17:15:58Z", [0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0], "July 9=242.43 mid-day down 1/2%.

However, I am not sure how to do it, so I will take a less robust approach to prior calculation. Currently, the stock is at 243 and average vol hovers around 0.32 for the next month. Therefore, I will assume a 2% daily move from now until August. Although I couldn't find FB's Q2 earnings date, last year it's been in late July (July 24th) therefore I expect this year's earnings to be around roughly the same time. I expect this to be a large catalyst given uncertainty around advertiser boycotts, increasing government regulation/scrutiny of the platform, retailer/advertiser bankruptcy (Brooks Brothers, J Crew, etc), and general COVID anxiety. Given this catalyst and the high vol, I expect FB to have a relatively flat normal distribution of returns around the 230-260 bucket. Therefore my prior is a 10, 20, 40, 20, 10 distribution.  Likelihood: now to adjust for the above. Firstly, I believe equity markets, although a little rattled, will rally on any good COVID-related news. Given 100+ drugs in the vaccine pipeline and most countries being able to control their pandemics, I believe the tide of news will tilt positive. I believe the virus will force Republican governors to enact (relatively) strict lockdowns, which should contain virus spread. However, the timing of this is unclear, with my COVID projection conservatively assuming 1 month until they do, which would imply that the conditions would only worsen in the US until then. Even if this happens, I believe many pure software companies like FB are largely immune from any negative news related to rising deaths/infections - in Q1 the company reported only modest declines in ad revenue (down 17% YoY in Q1) and saw conditions stabilize. Therefore, I believe ad declines for the company are at or near bottom. All of the above makes me tilt positive to 5, 15, 40, 25, 15.  On the other hand, advertiser boycotts and increased government regulation remain the main risks for the company in our analysis (ie until August). Government regulation is likely to be focused on Chinese tech and not American tech for the time being, especially with the pandemic and US Tech firms' actions in HK. The ad boycott is an interesting issue to analyze. On one hand, the cynical side of me says that, companies will continue to advertise as long as they can make money via FB (clearly demonstrable given ad analytics). This side of me says that FB will do some surface level/moderate reforms which will be enough for these companies to save face when returning to the FB platform. This side of me says that companies are pulling back because of cash conservation (due to COVID - think Levis and sales down 70% YoY and they pulled out) and virtue signaling (socially acceptable/trendy/way to boost sales). This side of me also says that FB's $70bn in revenue in FY2019 is difficult to hit hard, especially when FB's largest advertiser, HD, only spends 178m (in FY2019). So even if all top 10 advertisers pulled out and had HD's ad spend (not true since MSFT in #3 only spent 115m. Regardless, even if all 10 pulled out completely, then FB loses 1.8bn in revenue off a 70bn base (has to be adjusted for COVID of course). On the other hand, it is possible that this time is different (in that a boycott actually forced a large corporation to fundamentally change) - massive social unrest & record unemployment aren't helping. However, I would not adjust my distribution of percentages given that I think Mark & the FB team are smart enough to handle this type of issue (however big it actually is). Therefore, my final distribution is 5, 15, 40, 25, 15.
