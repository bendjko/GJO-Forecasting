With no polling data in the last week, and no debate (Hernandez and his team didn't show up, didn't comply with court order) what can we look at that could possibly give an indication of what is most likely to turn the tide and in which direction? \n Looking at headlines, international newspapers giving the main focus to the Hernandez phenomenon. On social media, I found it surprising to see posts from influential figures like writers, singers who are Petro supporters using a defeated tone, hinting at a Hernandez win and reproaching Hernandez voters. The overwhelming number of replies to such posts were in support of Hernandez and the majority were citing \"miedo\" or fear of Petro and the onset of a Venezuela style socialism (for which there is no evidence of. As much as Petro might have been close to Chavez 15 years ago, there's plenty of evidence in the work he has done since that that is not the model he would pursue). Support for Hernandez is not so much the drive but adversion towards his opponent. \n So, to close the forecast, here's what is making me tilt the balance to give Petro the edge:\n - Google searches for Petro's proposals (including youtube) are again higher than Hernandez's. People supporting Petro believe he represents a better Colombia, while too many people supporting Hernandez do it because of a \"anyone but Petro\" sentiment. My bet is that the latter have less conviction and willingness to show up to the polls on Sunday if it's too hot or it's raining and in a close election that can make the difference.\u00a0 - Young people's votes. Well-organized groups of young people are behind Petro in very significant numbers and this includes the young people, college students, who participated in protests and saw many of their friends injured or die on the streets killed by the government's brutal crack down. I think that sentiment will be strong and can make enough of a difference. \n - Searches for Rodolfo Hernandez, including searches for \"propuestas\" and \"programa de gobierno\" hit quite a low in the past 7-10 days. Hernandez hasn't had much to offer in terms of proposals or program. He has said that his job will be to manage and hire the right people to run the different aspects of government.  But his anti corruption speech is very far reaching and his simplistic style in explaining government failures is very popular. He does manage a lot of information about running government and the problems with bureaucracies in Colombia. His engineering background also gives him a straight to the point, \"minimalist\" matter of fact. This has an impact on average people and his success in business adds to his appeal. Hernandez often said he will figure things out once he gets to the presidency and that he doesn't need to go out on the streets to campaign because he is managing the emotions of the people, adding that campaigns are too expensive because in Colombia, every headline or good word from the media has to be paid so he rather appeals to people emotions and for that he doesn't need to tour the country.  His supporters say they will vote for him because he is a business man who knows how to manage things and that they trust that while Petro inspires \"miedo\" or fear (almost 400,000 Venezuelans now live in Colombia after fleeing their home country and the \"socialism\" line of attack is at the forefront). That said, is Colombia ready for such a non traditional approach to campaigning? Doesn't Hernandez need to show up to the areas where he has the most support to consolidate? - The effort Petro's running mate, Francia Marquez, has made is very significant. I haven't seen such a vp candidate in Lat Am in a very long time. The campaign has taken advantage of her strengths and she's been traveling all over the country.\u00a0 - Taken aback by the rejection rate of Petro in some circles and wondering how far reaching that could be but seeing signs that people with high rejection rate for Petro would vote blank or abstain. \n - Looking at percentages of supporters of first round candidates who now support Petro. \n - Taking a look at the latest developments, news regarding the campaign, the most notorious is the video of Hernandez entertaining foreign investors and lobbyist in a yacht, dozens of women in bikinis dancing with the guests. But for Hernandez supporters, such a video, as exploitative it can be (capitalizing on Colombia's reputation for exporting women, uncomfortably touching on issue re sexism, human trafficking) would be a source of pride or humor and also a symbol their 77 year old \"viejito\" (little old man nickname) is virile and with stamina.  I don't think it'll do much damage in those undecided or planning to vote blank. As a side note, Pfizer execs are denying they had reps at the yacht party. \n Hernandez's blunder in which he said he'd welcome the virgin Mary and all the prostitutes that live in her neighborhood seem to have started a domino effect in which more and more people started noticing his gaffes. Another reason he may lose some people to blank votes. In some ways, he may be like Trump whose supporters are immune to his gaffes.\u00a0 Unlike in 2018, not very confident about this forecast. Changed location on Twitter to Colombia to see buzz but this is till a tough one to predict. As Hernandez said, a lot of people have to be paid to say something good about you while campaigning. It's become harder to discern sincere, organic engagement than \"influenced\" The blank vote is the one that seems to be gaining most ground in the end.\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"], [767, "2022-06-19T03:59:47Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.3, 0.7, 0.0], "."], [691, "2022-06-17T13:58:49Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.21, 0.79, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2022-06-17T13:08:40Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [96828, "2022-06-17T11:19:48Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.47, 0.53, 0.0], ""], [100653, "2022-06-17T09:33:32Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.69, 0.31, 0.0], ""], [88452, "2022-06-17T08:13:46Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.29, 0.71, 0.0], ""], [767, "2022-06-17T04:37:29Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.49, 0.51, 0.0], "No other polls have come out since I last updated (polls are prohibited 7 days before the election), then again polling wasn't very accurate on the first round. The election is still expected to be very close.  Haven't found reliable info on new support garnered by Petro.  Focus of media coverage leans towards Hernandez's rise in popularity and attacks against Petro's \"socialist\" or progressive proposals in a conservative country or the likelihood of Colombia going the way of Venezuela. Petro is often mentioned in relation to his guerrilla activities in his youth, past ties to Cuba and his closeness to Hugo Chavez (he now says that the Chavez model failed for linking it to oil revenues and for forgetting about its democratic principles). But he recently told Le Monde that his agenda would be considered as centrist in Europe while in a country like Colombia, his centrist agenda is seen as revolutionary (for things like seeking to create a pension system or having what are seen as radical ideas about environmental protections).  Social media indicators give Petro quite an advantage but 1) he's been around much longer, this is the third time he runs 2) social media engagement can be both positive and negative and thus not necessarily an accurate measure of acceptance or support. Google searches also favor Petro.\u00a0 Investors, businesses, the party in power, are behind Hernandez, as well as the wealthy. Petro attracts more intellectuals, progressives, middle class while the poor seem to be split in their support.\u00a0 This week, the WSJ editorial board called Petro \"a former terrorist\" not merely a former guerrilla member back in the 90s who went on to become a senator and also mayor of the capital, Bogota. Colombia has been the exception in Latin America in the last few decades in not veering towards leftist governments. That said, I was surprised to see the number of highly educated people, economists, that are against Petro, saying his proposals would take Colombia back to the 80s and offer nothing new.  The campaign saying that Petro would turn Colombia into another Venezuela has proven to be effective, but also is Petro's campaign for a \"humane Colombia\" as well as his running mate calls for \"vivir sabroso\" and her award winning environmental advocacy.  Both Petro and Hernandez sell themselves as anti establishment and are said to represent a change from the status quo but Petro's proposals to tax the wealthy, seize pension assets, introduce public health care, and ban fracking and new oil exploration -- replacing oil industry with tourism, are seen as a real threat by many. Hernandez has shown to barely know the country, and makes one gaffe after another, but seems less threatening to many. He made a fortune in real estate and construction and has promised to build minimalist homes for people in rural areas, a program that has given him much popularity. His supporters don't seem to care that he called Hitler his favorite thinker (to later say he meant to say Einstein). People chuckle and feel safer with a successful business man at the helm than with a \"socialist\" who they see as a threat to private enterprise.\u00a0 For one, Hernandez's campaign seems messy, scrambled, much less sophisticated organizationally and it's hard to believe people will vote for 77 year old who is funny on Tik Tok and is very much a Trump like figure (yes, with a quasi messianic component).  Digging but haven't found an element that'd make tilt the balance and I can't believe people will vote for Hernandez is not a sound rationale. A judge ordered a presidential debate to be held before Sunday\u2019s election. In Colombia candidates are said to often avoid going to debates when they are leading in polls and Hernandez would clearly be at a disadvantage against an experienced, more articulate candidate like Petro.\u00a0 I will wait to see what happens at the debate to get a better feel for the last stretch.\u00a0"], [31275, "2022-06-17T03:05:09Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.4, 0.6, 0.0], ""], [96828, "2022-06-17T01:19:21Z", [0.03, 0.01, 0.0, 0.14, 0.37, 0.45, 0.0], ""], [96828, "2022-06-17T01:15:35Z", [0.03, 0.01, 0.0, 0.15, 0.38, 0.43, 0.0], "It seems Colombians are quite interested in Rodolfo Hernandez.

He fancies himself as el Rey del Tik Tok (King of Tik Tok which has quite a reach). His campaign announced today that his life has been threatened by Petro's campaign and is cancelling all public appearances. Hernandez was campaigning today in Miami but some people thought he had fled the country due to safety concerns. Also notable this week is the resurgence of news related to Hernandez's daughter who as kidnapped in Colombia in 2004 and believed to be dead. Hernandez said she had been kidnapped in 2009, while his son said it was in 2004 and that she was kidnapped and killed by the ELN, then accused another guerilla group. All while the press leads with \"ex-guerrillero Gustavo Petro\" It's quite a contrast.  Hernandez also said the solution to the drug problem was to provide free drugs to addicts and that he had plans to do so. Meanwhile, he is being investigated for corruption while he was mayor of Bucaramanga, in relation for a $2 million bribe for public contracts involving his son. Hernandez is on tape made public by the district attorney saying \"that they lay doesn't matter\" but not even that seems to have an effect on his followers/ All these controversies have kept him dominating headlines and social media engagement.\u00a0\u00a0 -Petro on the other hand is relying on his message of \"humane\" Colombia to reach voters and is on the defensive -- he was part of a guerilla group, M-19, disbanded in 1990 and was mayor of the capital, Bogota, and senator since then but he has not been forgiven -- while Hernandez leads engagement. Supporters of 4th place candidate, Sergio Fajardo, and his vp running mate, are now supporting Petro, which means a part of the center right may vote for Petro.\u00a0   This is the third time Petro runs for president, will he have AMLO's luck? It's uncertain. The campaign behind Hernandez after the first round is very strong and well-organized. The traditional right, the party in power who represent Uribismo, and their candidate, Federico Gutierrez, are now supporting Hernandez.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/06/07/colombia-rodolfo-hernandez/?utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_medium=social \n \n"], [31275, "2022-06-10T15:34:51Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0], ""], [98842, "2022-06-10T11:48:05Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.65, 0.35, 0.0], ""], [94872, "2022-06-10T02:30:37Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.45, 0.55, 0.0], ""], [20156, "2022-06-09T15:58:16Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2022-06-09T14:31:43Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.57, 0.43, 0.0], ""], [1646, "2022-06-08T17:22:32Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.46, 0.54, 0.0], ""], [106470, "2022-06-07T22:08:39Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.44, 0.56, 0.0], ""], [96618, "2022-06-07T19:23:39Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.52, 0.48, 0.0], ""], [14432, "2022-06-07T16:29:49Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [88452, "2022-06-07T08:27:27Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.9, 0.0], "Hernandez does not even have a proper party or organization behind him, and his crowd/campaign had pretty poor results in previous elections. https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liga_de_Gobernantes_Anticorrupci%C3%B3n#Resultados_Electorales I wouldn't be surprised if recent opinion polling that sees him as front runner turn out to be manipulated and/or bought artefacts (he's not inside the media business like e.g. Silvio Berlusconi, but also made a fortune in construction; perhaps he has influential friends who own media outlets).

Colombia is a conservative country and it's not clear that much has changed since 2018 to catapult Petro to the presidency.
