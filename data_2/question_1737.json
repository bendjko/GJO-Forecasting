Kings County accounted for 27.5% of the overall vote (Rose 59.8%/Donovan 39.7%) and Richmond County accounted for 72.5% of the overall vote (Rose 50.5% / Donovan 49.2%). Donovan had won his prior election by a wide margin in a special election that only garnered 42,569 votes where he lost Kings County but carried Richmond County by a wide margin. Nicole Malliotakis has run for State Assembly five times. In 2010 she defeated two time incumbent Hyer-Spencer by a 52% to 42% margin (26,705 votes in total). She lost the vote in Kings County but won by a wide margin in Richmond County. In 2012 she defeated local deli owner John Mancuso 55% to 35% (38,004 votes) again losing Kings County but winning Richmond County by a wide margin. In 2014 she defeated Marybeth Melendez by a margin of 71% to 26% (21,147 votes) this time winning a close race in Kings County and again winning Richmond County by a wide margin. In 2016 she ran uncontested to retain her seat. In 2018, she beat Adam Baumel by a margin of 60% to 40% (34,731 votes). She lost the vote in Kings County and again won by a wide margin in Richmond County. In 2017, she lost in a mayoral bid to Bill DeBlasio by a wide margin, but garnered about 70% of the votes cast in her district. Both candidates beat an incumbent to win their seats. Rose in an apparent upset and Malliotakis in an even race. Rose\u2019s win was on a much larger scale than Malliotakis, who is by all accounts, a rising star in the local Republican party. Both candidates are more moderate for their respective parties, however Rose only voted with Trump 7.5% of the time so far during his stint in Washington.  Rose is against defunding the policy and Malliotakis is \u201cneither pro-life or pro-choice\u201d, however has voted against transgender bathrooms and is against NY being a sanctuary city and providing driver licenses for illegal residents. Malliotakis has been endorsed by Trump, which is debatable whether this will help or hurt her. Borough President James Oddo (Republican) has not made an endorsement and has work with Rose on many public endeavors.  Through the end of June, Rose has raised more than double the amount of Malliotakis ($5.7M to $1.8M). Bottom Line: Rose is a moderate that plays to both sides of the aisle. Malliotakis is less moderate and has been dubbed a rising star within the Republican party but has yet to face a tough challenger outside of her failed mayoral bid in 2017. Kings County will undoubtedly go to Rose, but he will need at least an even showing in Richmond County against the native Malliotakis to win.\n"], [88766, "2020-08-19T12:55:06Z", [0.5, 0.5, 0.0], ""], [57400, "2020-08-18T22:26:32Z", [0.35, 0.65, 0.0], ""], [31275, "2020-08-18T19:06:29Z", [0.8, 0.2, 0.0], "https://www.thecity.nyc/politics/2020/8/17/21372984/staten-island-max-rose-borough-james-oddo-malliotakis"], [64078, "2020-08-18T18:04:59Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [90733, "2020-08-18T15:18:27Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2020-08-18T14:52:11Z", [0.95, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [84880, "2020-08-18T01:37:58Z", [0.77, 0.23, 0.0], ""], [76743, "2020-08-18T00:43:32Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [90457, "2020-08-18T00:20:52Z", [0.87, 0.13, 0.0], ""], [89013, "2020-08-17T09:04:50Z", [0.85, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [36547, "2020-08-17T08:51:11Z", [0.64, 0.36, 0.0], ""], [95082, "2020-08-17T04:55:55Z", [0.75, 0.25, 0.0], ""], [88153, "2020-08-17T00:23:21Z", [0.65, 0.35, 0.0], "PredictIt, rated tossup by the major election handicappers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York%27s_11th_congressional_district).

Trump \"only\" won this R stronghold 56/41 in 2016 - he underperformed Donovan, the R House candidate by about 5%. Rose won on Staten Island and the small portion of Brooklyn covered by NY11, massively improving on the results from 2016. Is this district becoming reliably D or will Trump pull it back to R? This is the kind of suburban district that Trump has  looked increasingly weak in, but it is also a district with a disproportionate # of law enforcement officers and others who fit the \"law and order\" side of the R party - will they come out strong in repudiation of the BLM movement?
