Given that the Olympic trials have already been conducted in most countries, and that no cancellations has ever been announced this close to the games (we are now about one month away from the Olympics starting), I'm adjusting down my estimate from the base rate. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Olympic_Games_host_cities\nhttps://www.historyextra.com/period/modern/have-olympic-games-cancelled-postponed-tokyo-2020-coronavirus-pandemic/\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1940_Summer_Olympics\nhttps://www.nationalww2museum.org/media/press-releases/recalling-londons-lost-olympics-national-wwii-museum-highlights-history"], [101303, "2021-07-02T14:38:13Z", [0.01], ""], [101329, "2021-07-02T14:18:18Z", [0.01], "Let's first look at the historical base rate. There are just five out of 56 potential Olympics that have been cancelled, namely three out of 31 potential Summer Olympics (28 actually occurred) and two out of 25 Winter Olympics (23 actually occurred). So the base rate is, like Tony said, about 1 in 11.  However let's take the inside view now and adjust this estimate. There are less than 2 weeks until the given date stated of July 15, 2021, so if this announcement will come, there is not too much time left. Moreover, many of the potential reasons to cancel the Tokyo games are caused by reasons due to the COVID pandemic. There have been no cancellations of a modern Olympic games due to a pandemic in history: we can look at https://knowablemagazine.org/article/health-disease/2020/pandemics-recent-history and see that while these pandemics overlapped with Olympic games, there were no cancellations then. Additionally, with COVID infections dropping significantly in Japan since May from around 6000 to 1400 a day as one can see by a simple Google search, and the setup for the Olympics in full swing (https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/tokyo-olympics-set-open-month-after-waves-covid-infection-opposition-n1271794, and Olympics trials for national teams in many sports already having occurred), in conjunction with the limited time horizon it seems extremely unlikely that the Olympics will be cancelled.

London has around 2,000 case per day and a population of less than 9 million and is hosting the Euro 2020 tournament with large crowds allowed as well (whereas the Olympics will have no visiting crowds, and its unclear if any crowds will be allowed). Obviously these are not perfect comparisons as the Olympics brings together people from a wide variety of countries which presents more risk, but an IOC spokesperson said that \"well above\" 80% of residents of the Olympic and Paralympic Village in Tokyo will be vaccinated as well as around 80% of the media, which seems to mitigate this risk. \nFinally, the head of Japan's Olympics organizing committee ruled out a few weeks ago another suspension of the games (especially driven by the massive cost delaying the games had). Now that there are only about two weeks until the games are set to begin, it might be possible that all spectators will be banned but it is unlikely that the games are suspended/move as a whole.

While the Olympics have been canceled or postponed in the past, never before has such an announcement come so close to the commencement of the event. In fact, this is an extraordinarily rare occurrence for any mass international sporting event, and those movements/cancellations have almost always come as a response to a completely unprecedented event - typically natural disasters or similarly catastrophic events. In this case, base-rate comparisons are likely not as important as the specifics of the situation itself, and a variety of developments across the spectrum of interested parties have clarified that it would take a situation similarly shocking to last year's Covid cancellation in order to force another postponement of the Olympics. The IOC generates $4bn in advertising revenue from the Olympics each cycle, which given the Summer Games' popularity relative to the Winter Games implies Summer ad revenue of ~ $2.5bn. Given pressure from these sponsors, particularly television rightsholders like NBC, and the potential perception hit the IOC might take from a full-on cancellation given their already unsavory reputation, the IOC's incentives are strongly aligned in favor of holding the Games. Additionally, the IOC/Japan contract gives the IOC the ultimate authority as to whether or not the Games will go ahead, so even if Japan's government is against the Olympics proceeding, they'd need to take extreme action in order to prevent them from occurring at the given start date. The other primary stakeholder in this situation is the country of Japan, which may face the strongest incentive to postpone or cancel the Olympics given the public pressure to do so - upwards of 80%, given the country's relatively low vaccination rate (https://www.nbcnews.com/news/olympics/ahead-tokyo-olympics-japan-vaccination-rate-far-mark-n1272523) and the push by medical professionals and news media to more strongly consider that possibility (https://www.espn.com/radio/play/_/id/31519855). However, while the Japanese government would be the body most responsive to public opinion, there are several reasons why them doing so and not proceeding with the Games is unlikely: 1. Sunk-cost fallacy -- Japan has already spent ~ $30bn on preparations for the Games over the past decade. Not holding the Olympics would \"waste\" all this work, and although it's a sunk cost and shouldn't be taken into account, there's a strong emotional attachment to the Games on the part of Japan's government, which leads to...\n2. The Games' purpose -- Japan won the bid to host the Olympics under the narrative that it would showcase the country's rebound from the earthquake/nuclear disaster of 2011, a bid led by the Japanese government. This narrative has now pivoted to a worldwide Covid recovery-oriented one as the first Olympics since the onset of the pandemic, and as a country that has handled the pandemic relatively well vs. other nations, Japan's leaders are invested in showing the world the strength of both their disaster and Covid recoveries.\n3. Response to public opinion -- the current Japanese government, which supports holding the Games, is up for reelection this fall. This would normally give rise to concern about the possible negative impact of ignoring public opinion with an election in the near future, but the ruling Liberal Democratic Party has won sound victories of > 12% in every election since 2012. This implies that even a move towards opposition parties would still leave the LDP in a strong political position, lessening their concern about possibly losing power.\n4. Preparation efforts -- this does not mean that Japan is taking no steps to respond to the concerns of their population. Stadium capacity is limited to local residents at 50% with no cheering allowed, and the typically active Olympic Village is siloed to prevent excess interaction amongst athletes and with the larger Tokyo population. There are also very strict protocols regarding the teams themselves - for example, in gymnastics, if one team member tests positive for Covid-19, every team member is no longer able to compete. While some may view such measures as excessive, it's an indicator that there has been a measurable response to the concerns raised by Japanese citizens. In summation, with only two weeks until the close-out period of this question, my estimates have been revised significantly downwards to where I believe it's extremely unlikely it's announced the Games will not proceed in July 2021.

Since attending the sessions I have realised my original forecast is the worst possible prediction I could have made :-(  My epistemic overconfidence when making this forecast was high and mighty.  So let's try again: Outside Probability - There have been 31 Olympic Games in total (28 Summer Olympic Games and 23 Winter Olympic Games: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Olympic_Games_host_cities#:~:text=Since%20then%2C%20summer%20and%20winter,Games%20held%20in%2020%20cities).  Of these 31 games, only 3 have been cancelled (https://www.history.com/news/olympics-postponed-cancelled) due to World War 1 (1916) and twice during World War II (1940, 1944).  The IOC is fairly staunch when it comes to holding the games despite political turmoil and terrorism.   'The Games: A Global History of the Game' highlights the numerous times when \"Olympic officials turned a blind eye to violent human rights violations in order to ensure that the games went on\"(https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393355512).   The only Games ever to be postponed was the Tokyo Olympics (in March Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan and the IOC delayed the Games start date by a year).  This is an outside probability of cancellation: 3/31 = 0.097 (3dp) and an outside probability of postponement: 1/31 = 0.032 (3dp).  The total outside probability is 0.129 (3dp). Inside Probability - So, what effect does a pandemic have?  We have a precedent in that these Tokyo Games have been postponed already given Covid-19 so let's see what the situation was with the pandemic back in March 2020 when they make the decision to delay the Games.  On 15 May 2020, there were 102,759 daily cases recorded (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) and 4.8 million cases in total (since 22 January).  Fast forward to today, and on 11 June 2021 there are 414,857 daily cases recorded.  Based on stats alone you would think that given the number of daily infections sits at 400% of the original number that spooked the IOC into delaying the first time, they would most certainly delay or cancel.  So why haven't they? Possibly because: (1) the financial cost of cancelling the Olympics which would NOT be covered by insurance, (2) reputational risk given China (Japan's rival) is hosting the Winter Games in February 2022 and Japan wants to show it's resilience and save face and (3) we're now only 1 month away from the opening ceremony with Japan still adamant the Games will happen.  It seems the only reason the Games would be cancelled/postponed is if there is a sudden spike in covid-19 cases in the next four weeks (https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cancel-the-tokyo-olympics-its-unlikely-heres-why/).  And that is possible.  Looking at the same World-o-meter graph of daily new cases since 22 Jan 2020, I see have been 5 peaks, and right now cases are reducing and reaching the point of the last plateau (411,160 recorded on 19 February).  Each peak is higher than the last with a greater slope (likely due to new variants that are more transmissible - more people get infected at a faster rate).  I think there is a 25% chance of a spike in covid-19 large enough for Japan to cancel or postpone the Games, to occur in the next 4 weeks.  I think there is a larger probability for it happening in 2 months, but we only have 4 weeks to play with for this question.  Therefore my inside probability is 0.25.

On the other hand, you have the Japanese public, which is understandably resistant to an influx of ~6000 athletes and the thousands more coaches, administrators, media personnel that will follow. Finally, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has been facing a series of public criticism over his refusal to cancel the games. Fundamentally, the 7 day moving average of new cases in Tokyo is down 60% from a local max in early May, when many of the polls were taken. If we estimate this average decreases about 10 per day with a standard deviation of about 5 , then we can model this as a summation of roughly 50 (number of days) normal variables. Then we suppose correlation for consecutive days is about 75%. This means our summation (i.e. total change from now until the games) is distributed as N(-500, 5^2 * 50 + 2 * .75 * 50) = N(-500, 1325). If we assume that we need to reach early May levels for the games of having a 75% chance of being cancelled, then we can upper bound this as .75 * 10% (doubling our probability to account for fatter tails) to get a final answer of about 7. "], [101321, "2021-06-10T05:38:14Z", [0.06], "1. Referring to historical precedent, only five modern Olympics have ever been cancelled, either due to WWI or WWII (interestingly enough, Japan 1940 was one of the cancelled Olympics) - fifty-one games have been successfully hosted. By this calculation, there is a na\u00efve ~9% probability of an Olympics being cancelled. \n2. Since the pandemic is still ongoing, with many of its adverse effects still being felt (for instance, restricted travel between countries, increased suspicion of immigrants, reshaping/disruption of supply chains, changing power dynamics [via vaccine diplomacy], etc.), the probability of cancellation in 2021 is higher than any other non-pandemic/non-war year (i.e., if we condition on the existence of a \"global disruptor,\" then the probability of 9% would be an underestimate). Instead, we must consider the years for which a large ongoing conflict was co-occurring with an Olympic games. Referring to a list from Britannica, it appears that there were approximately 50 Olympic games that would have occurred during an ongoing conflict. For simplicity, we will assume approximately half of these conflicts would have not affected the host country and/or major participating countries. This means we have an updated probability of ~16% of cancellation.\n3. Moving to specific concerns in 2021, Japan has been faced with numerous challenges including 10000 volunteers who have recently pulled out of the games and intensely negative domestic sentiment towards the games. The first logistical challenge is offset by a reduced Olympic village and the presence of very few if any in-person spectators: there are less volunteers but also a lesser need for volunteers. The second issue is a bit more complicated to untangle. If we refer to surveys from 2020 around the time of the postponement, roughly 33.7% of survey respondents believed that the Olympics should be cancelled. Recent 2021 surveys have shown this number rise to around 40%. Given the upcoming parliamentary elections, negative sentiment could be political kindling for opponents of the current administration so perhaps an increase in the probability is warranted - arbitrarily let's say there is now a 21% of cancellation.\n4. Unfortunately, the sentiment of the Japanese citizens may not be too important in our calculation. As others have previously mentioned, the Olympics can ultimately only be cancelled by the IOC. Beyond this argument of irrelevancy, we also have to consider the fact that a successful Olympics (which should be defined as an event which has little Covid transmission, demonstrates Japan's competence, and generates commercial interest) will boost the profile of the current administration whereas cancelling the games will likely not have the same magnitude of positive sentiment. At the same time, the long-term perception of Japan may be affected if the Beijing 2022 Olympics proceed just six months later, i.e., geopolitical tensions in the area may motivate Japan holding the event. So we can return to a probability of 16% and actually decrease it a bit to - let's say 12%. \n5. Instead, we should consider the sentiment that actually matters to the IOC: those of participating countries. As of now, only North Korea has withdrawn from the games (in early April). This is in contrast to March of 2020 when several countries including Canada and Australia withdrew from the games which ultimately preceded the postponement announcement - Olympic committees from several countries had also voiced concern in 2020. From some cursory searches, I did not find evidence of similar statements being made. This suggests that the international sentiment - and specifically the sentiment of the IOC's constituent committees is in favor of proceeding with the games. We can therefore further reduce the probability (again, perhaps arbitrarily) by half down to 6%. \n6. Profitability is the ultimate deciding factor for the IOC in these games. In the most recent games, 73-75% of revenue was from broadcasting. Viewership figures are a bit unclear (they are broadly up, but not necessarily in the avenues that the Olympics will be broadcast and advertising as a whole has decreased). One thing we can consider are similar events to the Olympics and their relative performance. For instance, despite increased time at home, the 2021 Oscars had a record lower viewership (this can also be attributed to the fact that movie theaters were closed during the pandemic), and the 2021 NBA viewership has also not recovered to a substantial extent (aside from blockbuster matches). These events are US-centric and one potential event that could be used to extrapolate Olympic figures is the Copa America which has faced similar issues as the Olympics as a large sporting event. Depending on how Copa America precedes (begins on June 13), the IOC may consider revising their approach. Specifically, if viewership numbers are depressed and the event sees high rates of Covid transmission, the IOC may be more likely to postpone or cancel. As such, this prediction should be updated to reflect new information after the first few days of the Copa America. As it currently stands, there is an 6% chance the games will not commence in July 2021."], [101289, "2021-06-10T04:45:35Z", [0.03], "The extent of the preparations for the olympics can be seen on the website, including detailed schedules and timetables.

I would rate this probability at 5%. A situation in which the Japanese government defies the IOC and unilaterally \"announces\" the cancellation of the Olympics also seems plausible, and I would rate this probability at 1%, seeing that 1) it would be an extreme measure, not characteristic of diplomatic and deliberate Japan, and 2), the Japanese government does not seem to cave into public pressure often."], [101293, "2021-06-10T04:27:43Z", [0.03], "The IOC has been adamant about going forward with the Olympic games, and it is only a month before the games now, with no indication of the IOC budging on their opinion.

There will be frequent testing required and many rules in place to prevent the spread of COVID, and unless there is another significant wave of a new strain of the virus, the IOC is intent on having the summer olympics this year. With the start of the olympics quickly approaching and the number of preparations that are already underway, it would take a significant outbreak and change in the pandemic situation to incite another postponement. The probability of such a thing happening isn't insignificant, and since the pandemic status is constantly changing, I think there is a 10 percent chance of this happening.

After already postponing once, it would be unwise to postpone again this close to the anticipated commencement. Doing so would also have some nontrivial impacts on the economic and financial implications on the Japanese economy. It would also seem to go against the beliefs of Japan's Head of Government Yoshihide Suga. From a health-oriented point of view, Japan has been handling COVID19 much better since its second spike in mid-May, with just barely over 2000 new cases as of June 6, 2021. To establish precedent, postponements on this time scale rarely happen in the sporting world, which should establish an intuitive \"prior\" to this decision. Though COVID19 has changed that landscape and some events (like the World Indoor Athletics Championship) have been postponed twice (from 2020 to 2021 and now to 2022). While using precedent and data might be a mistake given the novelty of COVID19, I think an important comparison to use is the UEFA Euro 2020 tournament, which will be commencing on June 11.

It can be seen that the NBA opened limited capacity around march 30, for when the 7-day moving average was about 65000 for new cases. Scaling this down to Japan's population and dividing by a factor of 2 just to gain a lower bound, we would need to have a 7-day average of about 14.4k cases in Japan for the games to not be cancelled from this perspective, which is barely the upper bound of the number of cases by the time the games begin according to healthdata. Even when building our own model of the number of cases by empirically determining the parameters of some gaussian distribution to forecast future projections (and repeating it for, say 100 times to gain a 95% confidence interval similar to @zsekaran's) it will, only in rare circumstances, increase to levels deemed unfit for in-person attendance for the Olympics.

"], [101279, "2021-06-10T03:48:46Z", [0.03], "Currently there appears to be heavy pressure within Japan to cancel the games due to concern over the safety of the athletes. According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, currently both Japan and the IOC (International Olympic Committee) insist the games are a go. With the games commencing in less than a month, this gives strong confidence that the games will commence. However, to even better understand whether or not the games must be cancelled, we must look at who is capable of cancelling the Olympic Games, what conditions/penalties are incurred for cancelling the games, and what forces would push the entity to cancel the games.  From many reports, it is clear that the entity that has the power to cancel the Olympic Games is the IOC. According to BBC, the exclusive owner of the Olympic Games is the IOC and only the IOC can officially cancel the games.  Considering the games have already been delayed a year, and 73% of the IOC revenues are generated from the games, the organization can not afford to cancel. Furthermore, the organization has insisted the games will commence safely for athletes. Because the IOC is nearly certain to not cancel the games, the only entity that can prevent the games is potentially Japan. Japan may possibly attempt to prevent the games due to a strong majority of Japan citizens opposing the games, low vaccination rates, and uncertain Covid prevention measures. However, Japan has reportedly invested upwards of $30 billion in the games, and faces the potential of being sued by the IOC if they cancel the games as the right to host is explicitly included in the contract. This could potentially cost Japan billions of dollars. Because there is the potential nuclear option of Japan cancelling the games, I am thus assigning ~3% probability that the games are cancelled. Both entities have claimed the games are on, Olympic trials are under way, and the event is just a month away. The event is near certain not to be cancelled."], [101319, "2021-06-10T03:41:11Z", [0.1], "I think it is very unlikely the Olympics are cancelled because it would be a huge boost to Japan's economy, which like many other countries has been hit had by the pandemic.

Regarding A, the IOC, one week ago, stated that they plan on continuing with plans for the Olympics because 80% of athletes will be vaccinated. They stated this knowing that the Japanese population will not be vaccinated; therefore, it's unlikely that they will not hold the Olympics on the basis of low vaccination rates - otherwise, their reasoning would not be consistent. If their reasoning does change, then it would be much more likely for them to still hold the Olympics, but to have no live visitors.  B is also unlikely as the IOC has made it clear that the event will take place even if the Prime Minister says it should be canceled. They continue to urge that they believe the Japanese public will remain safe, regardless of the mounting concerns.      Dick Pound, the longest-serving member of the IOC, stated that the probability that the Olympics will be held is much higher than 75%. While of course his judgement is likely subject to a lot of noise, his opinion is the most credible basis upon which we can even make our predictions today, given that the IOC makes the final decision. With each passing day, there\u2019s a smaller probability that the event will be canceled \u2013 last year\u2019s decision was made 4 months prior to the event, while we are now 1 month away. Overall, I predict a small likelihood that it will not commence in 7/21, attributing it to the off-chance that governments step in and incapacitate the IOC from holding the event (3%), or that the IOC reconsiders their logic (5%).\n"], [101286, "2021-06-10T03:02:18Z", [0.05], "Given that that July 15 is just about a month away, it would take pretty drastic events to cause Japan to cancel/postpone the Olympics.

We should also consider the IOC's behavior during the postponement of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics during March 2020 and see the similarities and differences to now. First, the coronavirus status in Japan. Cases have been steadily declining with a weekly average of 2500 new cases. In addition, Japan's quasi-state of emergency is lifted in 3 of its prefectures and the other 5 will be lifted June 20. \nSecond, the vaccination status in Japan. Japan has had one of the lowest rate of vaccinations in the countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and now only 12% of citizens have at least one dose. Currently there are about 680,000 vaccines administered every day, which would only leave about 25% of the population partially vaccinated by the time of the Olympics.\nThird, international travel safety. The United States has recently lowered its travel advisory from Level 4 to Level 3. While travel is still not encouraged, fully vaccinated individuals can travel. While the vaccination status in Japan remains low, Pfizer has pledged to vaccinate all competitors and staff of the Olympics, reducing risk of transmission during travel.\nFourth, communications from the IOC. On March 18 2020, the IOC opposed the cancellation or postponement of the Olympic Games only 6 days before recounting the statement. However, in March 2020, key details about the novel Coronavirus was unknown and information about the situation was rapidly changing due to increased testing and large spikes in cases. Currently, there is much more testing and information about the pandemic in Japan. In addition, the postponement was 4 months prior to the scheduled games, and there is only six weeks before the scheduled start date now. The IOC is insistent on the Games continuing despite Japan's state of emergency. The IOC has also said Tokyo 2020 would be cancelled if it is postponed again. \nFifth, the local sentiment about the Games. In late May a survey was conducted that found 83% of residents opposed the Games occurring this summer. Thousands of doctors also oppose the Games, and have urged the Japanese Prime Minister to postpone or cancel. \nSixth, WHO sentiment. The WHO currently endorses the games happening given the current safety measures in place and contingency plans like empty stadiums.  Most factors point towards the Summer Games happening. While local sentiment and vaccination statuses would point to the Games being postponed, international factors like the IOC, international travel safety, and the WHO outweigh these factors to give a highly unlikely probability that the Tokyo 2021 will be postponed."], [101315, "2021-06-10T02:33:22Z", [0.09], "Declining Tokyo infection rates, the continuation of work in the city to prepare for the games, sunk cost rationale from the Japanese government, and strong economic pressures from broadcasters and sponsors seem very likely to outweigh concerns of Japanese citizens.

Although the IOC has stated that a second postponement is unfeasible, and the minister in charge of Japan's vaccination drive has stated that they will \"hold the Games in a way that is feasible\", there still does seem to be an argument for postponement of the games. In particular, the vaccination rate in Japan is slow, with less than 1% of the population being fully vaccinated, and access to the vaccine is extremely limited, even for healthcare workers and other high risk populations. The majority of Japanese citizens support a cancellation or postponement of the Olympics, and prominent athletes, such as Naomi Osaka, have also spoken about the risk to athletes, especially the concern if they do not feel safe. Despite these concerns, I do not think that the IOC will move to cancel the Olympics. Covid concerns can be greatly mitigated by preventing spectators, and having the athletes quarantined and possibly vaccinated. Furthermore, the costs of postponement or cancellation run upwards of $15 billion, which  would be a huge blow to the IOC and to the Japanese economy. Lastly, the vice president of the IOC stated that the Olympics would be held starting July even if Tokyo remained under a state of emergency.

Another postponement is not an option by the IOC.\nThere is also significant pressure from  stakeholders for the games to proceed.\nAccording to a poll conducted in March 2021, 59% of respondents were in not in favour of holding the Games in the midst of a pandemic, 30% supporting the event. The polls seem to vary dependent on the reporting  but showing a trend to postpone/cancel.\nToshihiro Nikai,  the Secretary General of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party suggested that the Games could be cancelled dependent on control of the pandemic, but this was quickly backtracked by him with the Prime Minister, Yoshihide Suga signalling a no- change attitude in the Government indicating perhaps a level of discussion being held as to a cancellation.\nThe British Medical Association have advised against holding the Games, given Japan\u2019s poor record in controlling the virus.\nPressure may be relieved (at a significant loss of income) in that there will no spectators. Foreigners will almost certainly will prohibited from entering the country.\nThe participants in the Games will be subject to a regime of testing and social distancing by their home organisations and the IOC. The World Athletes President, Sebastian Coe believes the Games will proceed given the testing regimes he experienced at a half marathon test event in Sapporo this month.\nFrom the Stakeholders point of view, the official Japanese budget of $15 Billion has climbed to $26 Billion and rising. This would be written down as a loss if the games if the Games were cancelled. The IOC who are the owners of the Games are determined for the Games to proceed to protect the 73% of their income by way of broadcasting rights.\nIt is reported that Japanese companies have paid some $3 billion in sponsorship deals with International broadcasters spending significant amounts (NBC paying $1.4 billion for rights).\nThe Games are the exclusive property of the IOC and only they can terminate the contract between them and the host city of Tokyo. The IOC does have an obligation to the health of the athletes and could cancel if this was threatened (a case could be made here due to the pandemic). Should Tokyo unilaterally pull out, the organising committee would be responsible for all risks and losses.\nThere is also a symbolic significance as the Games would show a revival of Japan post Fukushima and Tsunami according to  Professor Jack Anderson at the University of Melbourne. Given the IOC\u2019s refusal to even consider a cancellation and the corporate finances spent, the chances of the Games proceeding are positive in that a degree of the expenditure may be recouped. https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/may/05/sebastian-coe-expects-tokyo-olympics-go-ahead-after-test-event-japan-half-marathon-sapporo  https://www.dw.com/en/could-japan-cancel-tokyo-olympics-over-coronavirus/a-57223286  https://apnews.com/article/tokyo-coronavirus-pandemic-2020-tokyo-olympics-japan-olympic-games-da4ecb601dee77b963005b89631c2724  https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/may/05/sebastian-coe-expects-tokyo-olympics-go-ahead-after-test-event-japan-half-marathon-sapporo  https://www.dw.com/en/olympics-senior-government-figure-admits-tokyo-games-could-be-scrapped/a-57208063\nhttps://www.ksat.com/sports/2021/04/30/are-the-tokyo-olympics-in-danger-of-being-canceled/\nhttps://www.bmj.com/content/373/bmj.n962\nhttps://www.scmp.com/sport/other-sport/article/3133377/why-tokyo-thinks-2020-olympics-show-must-go-even-covid-19-booms\nhttps://www.business-standard.com/article/sports/ioc-push-ahead-with-plans-to-open-tokyo-olympics-during-state-of-emergency-121042800133_1.html\nhttps://www.sportsnet.ca/olympics/article/britain-yet-decide-pfizer-offer-vaccinate-olympians/\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-57097853  https://thediplomat.com/2020/02/what-would-it-cost-to-cancel-the-tokyo-olympics/\n"], [40954, "2021-05-17T09:12:36Z", [0.8], ""], [28171, "2021-05-17T08:08:19Z", [0.25], "It would be lose of face for Japan and the IOC to cancel again.

The Games will be neither fun nor light-hearted nor equal-opportunity competitions, even at this point. It's all hardship, and the PR effect and communications strategy is a catastrophe. The calls for cancellation make sense to common-sense\n/because of the four waves in total of CoV-2 infections that Japan had to go through\n/given their geographic situation as an island, compared to Iceland, New Zealand or Australia the protection level in Japan for its dense population was particularly bad in the past 15 months or so.\n/additional adminitrative areas are under emergency due to high case numbers, which makes even travel within Japan for the Japanese a limbo - why exactly should foreigners be allowed to travel in Japan? (for long, there has been a strange mix of xenophobia and fascination of the world, and a tendency to isolate in the Japanese society)\n/The official tests and statistics likely and increasingly under-estimate the real problem and spread of SARS-CoV-2 within Japan, since even during the third wave hospital capacities used to be stretched and many ill with COVID-19 did not even make it there but died at home without help instead, which is a silent catastrophe. Preparedness in Japan for a pandemic was shockingly ignoble for a G7 nation one year into the situation.\n/Some national OCs have already announced they will skip preparatory phases in Japan and will get boarded as late as possible, in order to keep their stay in Japan as short as possible (legendary parties at night will probably not happen either this year), which could also be an expression of uncertainty about the status of the Games. However,\n/the denial of the problem is still real by both Japanes politics and the IOC, and the will to continue at all cost is amazing\n/the IOC is having a big financial and credibility problem, if the Games get cancelled at this late stage, and with all the communication that happened before. They almost linked their fate to the 2021 Japan edition.\n/in the Japanese society and faith the individual is subordinate to the good of the group, which may just change now with a younger more individual generation which fights for a right to emancipate, a right to protest, a right to take part in decision-making etc.\n/unfortunately, their leaders tend to be very traditional, very close-minded, very old, very complying men with obviously no intention to regard let alone find out what the real situation in their country is, or to disappoint the IOC. I thus start forecasting \"No.\", but continue to watch for major natural disasters in the meantime (there has been an earthquake of strength 6.0 recently), the human cost of which and dissarray caused by which could swing political intentions around."], [100923, "2021-05-14T22:20:07Z", [0.73], ""], [13657, "2021-05-14T21:36:20Z", [0.2], "I find it amusing that the country that is probably the most fanatical about wearing masks is being so hard hit with the virus. I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that Japan has a pretty high median age. Also they don't have a problem with malaria so typically don't use Hydroxychloroquine.  Anyway, I'm betting that financial considerations will stop them from canceling all together. Although with a July 28th start date, any delay at all will push it out of the July time frame. These are athletes for crying out loud, and they are extremely healthy and young.
