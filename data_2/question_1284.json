If no one wins a double-majority, the House may choose the governor.\" [1] I have thus assigned most of the ~15% chance that I give to a Hood popular vote victory to the \"none of the above\" option in which Hood wins the popular vote but Reeves is selected by the Republican majority in the House. I have increased this probability because, according to The Economist article, Tate Reeves has \"refused to rule out letting the House decide.\" See my earlier post for more of my reasoning on this: https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/901186 In any case, this race still leans Republican anyway [2] and the recent Trump rally in MS [3] will likely give Reeves a boost, so I am also increasing the likelihood of a popular vote Reeves victory.

And finally, as others have pointed out, Mississippi is one of the most inelastic states in the country - meaning that we should take this base rate even more seriously.  On the other hand, this election is certain to be a lot closer than the base rate would suggest, given Jim Hood's popularity. Hood has won the past four elections for Attorney General by a margin of at least 10%. He seems unusually popular for a Democrat and has staked out a number of popular conservative positions on social issues like guns and abortion, which is likely to help in the election.  It should be noted that in order to win a gubernatorial general election, a candidate must \"receive a majority in the popular vote and must win a majority of Mississippi's 122 state house districts. If no candidate fulfills both of these requirements, the Mississippi House of Representatives selects the winner. As of May 2019, Republicans held a 74-45 majority in the state house.\"[5] Though Hood has a fairly significant chance of winning the popular vote, it seems extremely unlikely that he will win a majority of state house districts given the state house make-up. I have assigned a significant probability to \"none of the above\" for the scenario in which Hood wins the popular vote but is not elected governor. There has apparently been no polling since Reeves won the Republican nomination. I will update in light of new polling.
