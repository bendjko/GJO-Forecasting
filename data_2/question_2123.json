I'm older than NATO and my background is in the soft sciences;  I don't have the math & computer skills to plot curves.  So, I enlarged the graph, copy-pasted the last 10 days onto a piece of paper, printed it, then used a ruler & pencil to extend the current curve 10-20-30 days.  At the current rate of increase, it appears to me that there won't be a 7-day average of cases over 200k until towards the end of January even though on some days recently the case counts have been around 190k. For 200k to be achieved, omicron would have to be far more infectious and there must be an equal ramping up of testing & reporting.\nPossible, but growing less likely as data seems to suggest that the steepest part of the omicron variant curve will be after Jan 1st.

The main argument I\u2019ve seen for why this would be is related to the spatial and social compartmentalization of the US, and the need for the virus to \u201cjump\u201d into new sub-populations before it can continue to spread. This process would cause some delay in the onset/growth rate of the wave that would make a bin #2 outcome pretty difficult to achieve (only 2 weeks left), given today\u2019s case counts. 2) as pointed out by @belikewater, the US was seen to have a pronounced dip in cases last holiday season that was a pure artifact of detection/reporting delays. There is a high chance that we will see a repeat of this effect again this year. Apparent case counts will therefore be lower (possibly by much more than 10%), thereby further reducing chances of a bin #2 outcome. Avoiding bin #2 gives no comfort at all since it\u2019s hard to see any other outcome than a massive Omicron spike sweeping the country early in 2022 / bin #3 causing all kinds of additional sickness, death, and economic problems.

Looking at last year, I think we can expect that the highest number in December will be reached on Friday, Dec 17. After that, cases will dip around the Christmas holidays and not rebound until early January. So for 200k to be reached in bin 2, it would need to be reached by Dec 17. That's in 14 days - it's a really tight schedule. If cases reach nearly 200k/day by next Friday, then it's possible. This would mean cases would need to accelerate faster this year than last year, but that's a reasonable possibility because this year, Delta is circulating. Come January and February, we can expect Omicron to start dominating cases as Delta cases die down (likely not because of Omicron, but in parallel to it). I expect we'll see a big surge in Omicron cases starting in January, and it's not clear to me how much we're going to do to try to slow it down, because mitigations have become so politicized and 1/3 of the country opposes even wearing masks.

A commonly encountered interpretation of this observation is that there is 1) a lull in testing / strong incentive to delay seeking medical treatment until directly after the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays while families are gathered; 2) significantly increased chances for new infections driven by large numbers of people traveling together in confined spaces and gathering indoors for festivities with trusted family members. This explains the apparent dip in cases coinciding with the specific holiday dates and the strong rebound in cases beyond previous highs thereafter. If the above paradigm holds for 2021-2022 holidays, then we are currently at the pre-Thanksgiving maximum caseload and should see a drop in cases over the next few days/week (Thanksgiving) followed by a large rebound in mid-December, and another dip in the second half of December, with the ultimate maximum caseload from the current holiday peak expressing in early January. Comparison of current avg. caseloads vs those seen a year ago shows that we are nationally still far below levels seen then (just below 100k now vs ~170k then).\nA year ago, the post-Thanksgiving \u201crebound spike\u201d was the one that first rang the bell for > 200k cases, and it eventually exceeded the pre-Thanksgiving maximum by about 50k cases. If the same increase vs current levels were to occur this year, we\u2019d still be quite safely below 200k. I am convinced that all evidence points to this year\u2019s post-Thanksgiving \u201crebound spike\u201d being smaller because of the impact of vaccination and because the massive uptick in cases is not happening everywhere in the US at the same time.  Therefore I\u2019m now eliminating the possibility of a 200k+ spike in bin #2. Further analogy with 2020-2021 shows the post-Christmas \u201crebound spike\u201d shooting up to exceed the previous maximum by a further 40k cases. If both expected 2021-2022 \u201crebound-spikes\u201d (post-Thanksgiving AND post-Xmas) do end up expressing with a similar magnitude to the previous year\u2019s outcome, then we really could plausibly see another (barely) 200k+ ultimate maximum, so adjusting probability for bin #3 accordingly.

I am nevertheless making a very minor adjustment triggered by:\n- a recent uptick in reporting on a new COVID delta sub-variant observed in Europe, e.g., [1]\n- a new estimate that it may actually have somewhat higher transmissibility than initially reported [2]\n- widely acknowledged remaining uncertainty So far, everything only points to an \u201cearly indication\u201d that (hopefully and very likely) will prove to be insignificant. I am (for now) pulling ~3% probability back from bin #5 to reflect a new scenario where this delta sub-variant (AY.4.2) or its future mutants become much more of a factor in the US COVID story than is currently anticipated, leading to an unexpected new, large peak in cases.  Apparently AY.4.2 is responsible for a small but growing share of cases in the UK. \u201cAt this stage, experts don't think AY.4.2 is likely to take hold - so in time it could well burn out and drop off the watch list.\u201d [1] \u201c Prof Francois Balloux, director of University College London's Genetics Institute, said: \"It is potentially a marginally more infectious strain.\n\"It's nothing compared with what we saw with Alpha and Delta, which were something like 50 to 60 percent more transmissible. So we are talking about something quite subtle here and that is currently under investigation.\n\"It is likely to be up to 10 percent more transmissible.\u201d [1] Today, reported that Israel\u2019s Health Ministry thinks that we\u2019re dealing with something that\u2019s \u201c15% more contagious than Delta.\u201d [2] \u201cThe UN health agency is currently tracking 20 variations of the Delta variant. The AY.4.2 is \u201cone to watch because we have to continuously keep an eye on how this virus is changing,\u201d said Van Kerkhove [World Health Organization\u2019s technical lead on COVID-19]. In the US, the Delta variant accounts for nearly all COVID-19 cases. The newer AY4.2 Delta variant has been spotted \u201con occasion,\u201d but it\u2019s not yet a concern, health officials said.\u201d [2] For me, this story seems worth watching closely, as reporting on it seems to be rising \u201cabove background\u201d and because throughout the COVID outbreak, major new developments generally first express in the news as seemingly minor local developments that gradually become reported as more serious factors. Fingers crossed AY.4.2 will not be one of these (go bin #5!).

At least one of the compound peaks exceeded 200k/day (Nov20-Jan21 peak; we are currently in the midst of the second \"compound\" peak, TBD if it will exceed 200k/day)\n- By eyeball, during approximately half of the time interval since the first COVID outbreak, there was no active new infection peak (steady or falling baseline), and the longest between-peak time interval was roughly 4 months. The two \"compound\" peaks observed so far are 6-7 months apart.\n- The current new infection rate during the ongoing \"compound peak\" (Sep21) is now at ~150k/day, although this value has been stagnant for a while now. The previous compound peak achieved ~150k/day, and rapidly progressed to exceed 200k/day, whereas the current compound peak seems significantly \"flatter\" at present.\n- During the period of COVID, only the Delta variant emergence seems to significantly have changed the evolution of COVID in the US (beyond the initial COVID strain to hit the US population).  https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html Assumptions/Interpretation:\n- Heightened indoor visitation during vacations and holidays can drive new infection peaks. Timing of increased new infection impacts arising from this behavior are highly predictable.\n- Emergence of new virus variants can be another major trigger of new infection peaks. Timing of significantly more infectious virus variants emerging is completely unpredictable. History suggests that new, worse variants don't emerge super frequently (not 5x/year, for example), although the recurrence timing and impact on the vaccinated is still extremely uncertain.\n- Vaccination significantly decreases likelihood of major new peaks. Magnitude of decrease depends on fraction of US population choosing to immunize, and the ability of new variants to overpower vaccine-related immunity. \n- Vaccine efficacy will decrease over time to an uncertain extent, potentially growing chance of a new peak if boosters aren't introduced\n- If all locations in the US experience a local new infection rate peak at the same time (e.g., during common holiday times), then the magnitude of the US-scale peak will be much higher than if the \"curve is flattened\" by various geographic regions experiencing the same peak weeks or months apart (e.g., introduction of variants at random, with effects distributed in space and time) To assign probabilities to outcomes, first ask the probability of not seeing another spike before 1 May 2022. This requires the current peak not to get worse (my subjective prior: high chance), and no holiday peak > 200k/day (my subjective prior: very uncertain), and no unforeseen new variants changing the \"predictable\" evolution of the virus (my subjective prior: medium-to-high chance). Given current evolution of the Delta strain and expected consequences of public behaviors around holiday season, there will probably be some kind of new holiday peak, given prevalence of vaccine refusal and increased travel/congregation, but it very much doesn't have to be a big one. All in, I assess a slightly better chance than a coin flip that no new exceedance of >200k/day will be observed before May 2022 (~8 month window vs 1.5 year window previously observed, with the many caveats listed above). Next, assign probabilities to the other, earlier > 200k/day outcomes. \nUltimately, I assign virtually all probability of a new > 200k/day outcome before May 1 to one of these scenarios: \n1) Delta persists and people travel/congregate over the holidays just like last winter, thereby causing a big new delta-driven peak that hits the >200k threshold. Subjective prior: a little better than 1/5 chance of combined Delta + families gathering leading to >200k new cases over the holiday season. However, based on last year's evolution of new cases, if this scenario is realized, the next 200k/day observation will much more likely occur \"on the way up\" during the peak, and this is much more likely to occur between Nov-Dec (vs Jan-Feb).\n\n2)  A new, currently unknown, more infectious variant emerges, and spreads quickly across the US. My subjective prior: perhaps 1/5 chance of occurrence (uniform across next 8 months), so I equally distributed this probability between the middle three possible outcomes (each is of the same duration). 3) The current peak in new infections changes course and does get worse and hits > 200k/day, perhaps because of back-to-school or people spending more time indoors for some reason. If this happens it will express as \">200k/day before 1 November\", and my subjective prior on this outcome is a little less than 1/10 chance based on differences in the evolution in this current peak of new cases vs the earlier one from last holiday season."], [55987, "2021-09-21T15:18:43Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.18, 0.01, 0.8], ""], [102430, "2021-09-21T14:38:36Z", [0.05, 0.1, 0.3, 0.3, 0.25], "It is tempting to be optimistic as we see cases level off or drop but a look at last winter and spring does not give me enough confidence to go in strongly for \"not before 1 May 2022\".

Moreover, Delta is making its way through the population at the moment, and will likely cause a much smaller peak of cases this winter as population immunity reaches levels >90%. In addition, one or more new variants capable of taking Delta's place have not clearly emerged. In short, I don't see a strong case for >200k in bin 2, but it's possible. If one or more new variants emerge, perhaps even sublineages of Delta, then bins 2 or 3 could be possible, although a variant that substantially escapes existing immunity would be required imo. We're in uncharted territory here. Will cases start to settle down once nearly everyone in the US has some form of immunity? As for bin 1, I don't think we'll see >200k before Nov. 1 because I think the Delta wave will generally be winding downwards between now and Oct. 31 (with perhaps an additional, lower peak between now and then). I think bin 4 would require a variant with extreme immune escape. The fall/winter wave last year infected ~20% of the population (including all infections, not just confirmed infections). The Delta wave will infect ~12%. That is all this extremely contagious variant can do in the face of widespread population immunity. When Delta is done and around 95% or more of the population has some immunity to SARSCoV2, unless an extreme immune escape variant emerges, this winter may look like the low end of an endemic Covid season: perhaps 5% to 10% infected. Before the pandemic, flu viruses infected 5% to 15% of the population; a small number of people were susceptible each year as the virus mutated and children were born. Not everyone who was susceptible was infected each year. With Covid, I think it's reasonable to expect a similar or greater percentage of the population will become infected each year, due to waning immunity, genetic changes in the virus, and its high transmissibility. So, if ~12% brought us to >150k cases/day, and ~20% brought us to >250k cases/day, then ~15% will need to be infected to reach >200k.
