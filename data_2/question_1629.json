The UAE is dependent to a degree on tourism/services and its airline(s) industry, these being the glue that binds everything together. And these have been the worst hit in the pandemic.  The question is how well IndexMundi will reflect the state on the ground. And IndexMundi might well be correct from their perspective. The UAE is a country with an 80% migrant population and a 90% migrant workforce. This could lead to low reported unemployment even when the country as a whole sheds 30% of its jobs. This could explain how IndexMundi reports a small jump from 2.33 to 2.70 in 2008 to 2009 - while these years were BAD for the UAE. I believe there would be an uptick in the unemployment rate reported by IndexMundi for the UAE, it could go to 3.50 maybe even 4.25/4.50. But exceeding 5.00 seems slim as of now. Would like to start with a baseline estimate of 15% for Yes.

Since many of the non-working in the UAE are not UAE citizens [1] it is not clear to me if they would count in the UAE unemployment numbers, as they have to be tied to an employer, even if they are not being paid. UAE citizens are getting 60% of their paychecks during the lockdown [1]. With that in mind, Emirates has cut 30k jobs [2], and a survey notes that 70% of Dubai's businesses could go bust due to the COVID crisis [3]. All this and low oil prices, make things not look good for getting loans paid back and could cause a general collapse [4]. But, it should be noted that although the UAE was hard hit in 2009 [4], there was barely a blip in their unemployment rate around that time [5].  So, the question seems to me if the government has enough money to keep its own citizens in jobs through 2020. That seems possible, since they have a pretty good amount of cash reserves currently [6]. With that, it seems like this will be a low probability for now.
