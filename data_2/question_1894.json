Similarly, certain Democratic strategists believe that demography destines their party to dominate the future, while neglecting specific individual races, causing them to lose ground badly in the House and state houses while continuing to win large majorities of the popular vote nationally.

An election is not the only way a union can become your representative.

The effort in Alabama look especially difficult as Amazon is a major employer offering job well above the local mean. The risk of shutting down the warehouse is significant to those voting on the effort. As it only takes 30% of the workforce to call for a vote, it isn't clear that there is majority support. There also don't appear to be strong motivating factors to organize around. While the workload is increasing, the pay is good and more secure than other retail outlets. I can't find any workforce injuries or fatalities in Bessemer that would bring closeness to a call for more worker protection. Therefore, the general population may be more upset with Amazon than the employee population is. While the incoming federal administration may offer more support to disgruntled workers, I don't think that factor is the predominant deciding point. It should come down to those people casting the votes weighing the risk of losing their jobs versus whatever upside unionization affords. During the pandemic, a $15 per hour job with a company that is expanding while watching friends and family laid off at other establishments should provide more gratitude than grief.  I would rate this much lower if not for the fact that \"any\" group of over a million employees seems like a broad stroke. An effort in Seattle, for example, would probably have a much higher chance of success. And, given the culture of Whole Foods, employees of those stores may be more likely to organize than others. If this question was strictly about the warehouse workers in Alabama, I would score it much lower. Still, getting a vote together is a long process and an uphill battle.
