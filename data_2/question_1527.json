Scott Morrison is the current leader of the governing Liberal Party in the Federal Parliament and as such is the Prime Minister.\nThe Liberal Party selects its leader by a popular vote amongst its members of Parliament and given the three-year electoral cycle there is system of constant campaigning that is exacerbated by media poll findings on a regular basis that determine popularity of the incumbent.\nA change of Prime Minister can occur in a matter of three days and has resulted in  7 Prime Ministers in 10 Years.\nThe job security of a  Prime Minister is dependent on the majority of the Parliamentary party has in place which after the 2019 election is 9 seats.\nMorrison suffered a popularity slump due to his lack of actions concerning the severe forest fires experienced during the (Australian) summer but has recovered over his governments efforts to defeat the coronavirus and hold back the resultant unemployment and has the highest approval rating in the last ten years.\nHe held the unemployment at 7.5% against a projected 11.3% due the jobseeker program and there is media speculation that this program will be extended from the initial September date. Therefore, given his current popularity, his government\u2019s handling of the current issues with the pandemic and China, a leadership spill would possibly be ill-advised and unpopular, his position is potentially safe for the next six months albeit in a volatile job.\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com.au/list-of-australian-prime-ministers-2018-8\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8189155/Scott-Morrisons-popularity-surges-amid-coronavirus-crisis-bushfire-PR-disaster.html#comments  https://time.com/5377190/why-australia-changes-prime-ministers/ https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8500827/Income-support-continue-past-JobKeepers-planned-end-date-says-Scott-Morrison.html  https://www.newstatesman.com/world/australasia/2018/08/why-australia-burns-through-so-many-prime-ministers  https://globalnews.ca/news/4406960/australia-prime-ministers/ https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-52703265\n"], [13306, "2020-07-11T22:46:34Z", [0.0], "Only an act of God could cause Scott Morrison to cease to be prime minister within the timeframe given.

Therefore I will reduce the probability of B occurring\u00a0-\nB = 4% = B * 0.2 This has been proven given the Labor Party upon enacting a very similar rule in 2013 hasn't had any Coups since. Y = 24% = A\u00a0+ B\nX = 76% = 100% - Y With regard to A, given the severity & nature of the Coronavirus I am very skeptical that an election will be held before 1/1/2021. In addition the Australian economy is expected to enter recession this year, not an ideal condition for seeking reelection in. The next House of Representative Election (Prime Minister sits in the Representative) must happen either before or on 3/09/2022. In the most recent election, held on 18/05/2019, the new Government was sworn in on the 29/05/2019. Assuming a 10 day delay from the election, for the next Government to be sworn in before New Years Eve the election at the latest must take place on 20/12/2020.\u00a0 Today's date is 28/03/2020. It is 890 days from 3/09/2022 and 268 days from 20/12/2020. A = 30% = 268 / 890 As to whether Morrison wins/loses such an election, I would say 50/50 given Coalition and Labor are the two dominant parties in Australia.

If Morrison is still in office on 1 January 2021, he will have been in office for 861 days - just 31 days short of the average prior tenure length. The base rate implies that if today was 24 August 2018, Morrison would have just slightly under a 50% chance of ceasing to be PM before 1 January 2021. However, given that he has remained in office since 24 August 2018, the base rate will consider the # days left in this question's time frame and the average PM tenure: 320 days left in time frame / average tenure of 892 = final base rate of ~36%  Relevant considerations: Our base rate implies that there is a ~36% of Morrison ceasing to be PM before 1 January 2021 - however, there are relevant considerations that significantly reduce the percent likelihood for this question. In particular, given that a general election has just taken place this past May, the only likely path for Morrison to cease being PM in the given time frame is a leadership spill - essentially, an intra-party challenge to his incumbency. Leadership spills are how four of five of Australia's most recent PM changes occurred, including the last one [2]. In these past leadership spills, only a majority (50%) of a party's vote was required to replace a sitting PM - however, this threshold has recently been raised to two-thirds in the Liberal Party (Morrison's party) for leaders who win an election [3]. Given that Morrison won a general election back in May, his standing is affected by this change. For this reason alone, the probability of Morrison ceasing to be PM should be lowered by perhaps 3/4ths to just 9% (keep in mind that the last leadership spill, for instance, would not have been possible if this rule was in place!). Another relevant consideration is that Morrison's victory in the general election this past May was an upset - he was not expected to win [4]. This fact has probably greatly strengthened his position within the party. However, my guess is that this is cancelled out by recent criticism of Morrison's perceived poor handling of the bushfire situation in Australia, which has caused his approval rating to fall [5]. Thus, we remain at ~9%.

Using this wiki article [1] it appears that of the 11 prime ministers since 1970, 8 were in power for longer than 2 and a half years. That metric implies a rate 3/11 ~ 25%. That definitely seems pretty high, but it provides a decent base rate.\n\nLooking more closely at this situation in particular, a PM can be replaced due to  a) death\nb) loses an election\nc) resignation Since Scott Morrison is 51, the probability of death is about .5% [2]. An election occurs once every 3 years, and since the last election was held in 2019, the only way an election occurs is if there is an early election. So, this question is mainly asking about the likelihood of a vote of an early election and, if so, does the liberal coalition lose. The only way this seems to occur is \"A Double dissolution\" where the two chambers cannot agree on certain bills. Since, the liberal coalition controls both chambers, this seems highly unlikely to occur. However, there are enough votes in the senate to hold everything up between labor and the other minor parties. So, they could potentially force another election that way.  The current split in the House of Commons and the Senate is very close, with the liberal coalition holding a very slight edge over labor in both. Given that Morrison's approval has fallen and Marles is up, labor may be able to gain significantly by calling an election. However, they would need to convince the minor parties to support them, and I do not know how feasible that is.  Given the complication in calling an election and the potential risk of doing so, I'm going to give this a low probability (10%) of occurring.  @nichodges how does what you suggested relate to the double dissolution? I couldn't find any article relating the two, but they both seem very important to this question. I enjoyed the article and it was very informative.
