It's hard for me to determine the actual support for the PM himself separate from Likud.\nThe electorate has stood by him throughout the many elections in recent times.\nBut if former PM Olmert's journey and outcome is any indication - this matter is very serious, the public will eventually react, and it will probably eventually lead to BN's resignation. Maybe even on the eve of trial if a plea deal can be arranged.\n But by all accounts - not until 2021. The PM has fought this for at least two years plus.

The 17th of May 2023 is the latest possible date for an election. However, early elections can be called by a vote of the majority of Knesset members, or by an edict of the President, and normally occur on occasions of political stalemate and of the inability of the government to get the parliament's support for its policies. This has happened often.  Probability of early elections called by majority vote in Knesset:\n- The Likud party holds the most seats so not likely that they would force election before the 1st of January 2021. However, due to ignorance I am guessing at least a 4% chance due to someone really wanting to get him from his own party or two or more parties join forces. The trial is a factor that impact governments ability to support policies, however, I see this a less important than the average power fights in politics.

[source] If a budget is not passed by then, the Knesset will automatically be dissolved and new elections will be called for November, in what would be the fourth round of voting in less than two years. Legislation to prevent Netanyahu running would have to be passed before the dissolution of the Knesset, a difficult but feasible prospect, the Channel 13 report said. The threat of such legislation is also aimed at preventing Likud from giving its support to a bill, proposed by the opposition right-wing Yamina party, that would limit the power of the High Court Justice to strike down laws passed in the Knesset, the report said. Blue and White is against the bill and is hoping to at least force Likud to not back it, if not to actually agree to oppose the legislation. The so-called override clause is due to be brought to a Knesset reading on Wednesday. The Walla news site reported Tuesday evening that Likud lawmakers will skip the vote on the override clause. Blue and White\u2019s leaders are said to believe Netanyahu is manufacturing the budget crisis in order to force elections and prevent Gantz from becoming prime minister in November 2021 as stipulated by the coalition agreement.

I think a conviction is a near certainty for reasons stated in my last post.   Yet, Israel has never had to deal with a prime minister convicted of corruption while in office.  The only other prime minister accused of corruption resigned before indictment.  Also, all other ministers indicted of corruption either resigned or were fired.   The Israeli Supreme Court has ordered the removal of other elected offices for conviction of lesser crimes but Netanyahu's situation is unique.  In my initial research I found an article that said a Knesset member must resign all cabinet positions when indicted pursuant to Israel\u2019s basic law.    After making a post, I had a reply (a while back, which I did not have time to respond to) asking if an Israeli prime minister had to resign if convicted and how long an appeal would last.  I tried to find the original article mentioned above but could not.  I think it was on the Haaretz website.   Unfortunately, I have used up my free articles, and they want me to buy a $120/year subscription that I am not willing to purchase just to answer this question.   Regrettably, The Times of Israel, Jpost, I24news and the other English language Israeli news websites were not nearly as helpful. \nIn any event, I did save one very insightful Haaretz article.  In that article and several Wikipedia articles, I learned some very important new facts.\nIsrael has something called basic law.  It was enacted in pieces over several decades.  From the Haaretz website Article 18 states: \u201c18. (a) Should the Prime Minister be convicted of an offense which the court defined as involving moral turpitude, the Knesset may remove him from office, pursuant to a decision of a majority of the Knesset members. Should the Knesset so decide, the Government shall be deemed to have resigned.\n(b) Within 30 days of the verdict becoming final [this is an error in translation. The Hebrew text does not include the words \u201cbecoming final\u201d \u2013 EC], the Knesset Committee of the Knesset will render its decision regarding its recommendation pertaining to the removal of the Prime Minister from office, and shall present its recommendation to the Knesset plenum; should the committee fail to bring its recommendation to the plenum during the prescribed period, the Speaker will raise the issue in the Knesset plenum.\n[\u2026]\n(d) Should the Knesset decide not to remove the Prime Minister from office, and should the verdict as per section (a) above become final, the Prime Minister will cease to serve in office and the Government shall be deemed to have resigned. [end.]\u201d On its face, it appears that Netanyahu must be removed upon a \u201cfinal\u201d conviction.  A conviction is final under Israeli law when the time for appeal has passed and no appeal was filed or when the appeals process has run its course.    The only conviction of an Israeli prime minister involved Ehud Olmert.  He resigned as prime minister about 30 days before being served with the indictment.   He was convicted, and his appeals lasted seven (7) years.  Yet, he remained as interim prime minister until a replacement prime minister was sworn in.  The corruption charges Netanyahu faces\u2014bribery, fraud and breach of trust\u2014were considered crimes of moral turpitude sufficient to remove other ministers and officials.  A conviction was not required for the Israeli Supreme Court to order the removal of lesser minsters. Specifically, the Israeli Supreme Court ordered Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin to fire two ministers in 1993 for corruption after indictment but before conviction. The Court noted that there was no statute that required a prime minister to fire these ministers but held that the basic law set minimum standards for serving in public office and did not exhaust the reasons for which a minister may be required to resign.   Further, the court held that failure to fire these ministers would undermine public confidence in government.  According to Haaretz, the court further held, \u201cthat the presumption of innocence does not preclude the removal of public officials based on reliable administrative evidence of criminal wrongdoing that is directly connected to their service in public office. According to the court, a criminal indictment imputing serious offenses to a public official would suffice for removal.\u201d Interestingly, the Israeli Supreme Court on May 6, 2020, found that Netanyahu was not required to resign for mere indictment like other ministers had.  A corrupt minister can return to public life if elected to the Knesset after conviction. Specifically, there is the interesting case of Aryeh Deri, the minister of the interior, who Yitzhak Rabin fired for corruption, who was convicted of corruption in 2000, and who was reelected to the Knesset in 2013.   He served again as minister of the interior in 2016, and briefly in other positions including minister of the economy and minister for religious services.  He was forced out a second time due to new corruption charges.    The Deri and Olmert cases make clear that even if Netanyahu is convicted he can remain until 1) his appeals are exhausted (7 years for Olmert); 2) a new prime minister is appointed (as did Olmert); 3) and, he can return to public life if re-elected after conviction .   In theory, he be interim prime minister until he was reelected as the new prime minister.  Thus, he could be the new prime minister replacing himself. The Supreme Court could still order him removed as it did with other ministers despite Article 18.  As stated above, they did order Yitzak Rabin to fire two ministers despite the lack of statutory authority.  The most likely scenario, I think, is that he was convicted but filed an appeal, which lasted until after this question has closed.      I think there is a 40-60 chance however that he could be forced to resign or the Supreme Court could remove him as a result of his conviction on these charges.

He goes to trial on May 23, 2020, in the District Court in Israel.  The court does not have juries.  It uses a mixture of an adversarial system and an inquisitorial system (where judges, not lawyers, ask questions.)   Therefore, his popularity as shown in the public opinion polls will have much less effect on the outcome since there will be no jury. The post-trial conviction rate in Israeli criminal courts is about 93 percent.  That is stunning.  I did some research and found a number of cases were Israeli ministers were convicted of corruption on Wikipedia.   Part of the reason is the vast majority of criminal cases are dismissed prior to trail.  Thus, it seems only cases with merit go forward.   I cannot imagine a prosecutor in Israel taking a case to trial against a sitting prime minister without a near perfect case.  I am a former criminal lawyer, and if the prosecutors office in Israel is like prosecutors offices  in the United States, losing  this case could easily end a career.  Therefore, I suspect the baseline of 93 percent should be increased a bit.  Also, Netanyahu has four criminal cases against him.  (There is a fifth to be tried at the same time, but Netanyahu is not charged.)   Netanyahu has also admitted the facts of these cases to be true.  He is arguing that he did not have the criminal intent.  For example, Netanyahu admitted receiving just under $200,000.00 in very expensive wine, cigars and jewelry (for his wife), and he did help the donor with an American visa, tax breaks and regulations in Isreal.  Netanyahu just said there was no quid pro quo.   Finally, in his negotiations to create the new government, he had been insisting on permanent immunity from prosecution.  Thus, he seems worried.  I do not know who the specific judges are and their backgrounds.  I also do not know anything about the prosecutors.   Finally, Netanyahu is going to trial in the District Court.  He will have the right to appeal to the Supreme Court.  Rarely is a new trial granted or a conviction overturned in Israel.  However, I do not know how long this will take, and whether Netanyahu can remain prime minister while the appeal goes forward.  All in all it is not looking good for  Netanyahu. https://www.haaretz.com/1.4950727\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigations_involving_Benjamin_Netanyahu\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary_of_Israel#Criminal_and_trial_procedure"], [88422, "2020-05-11T23:48:33Z", [0.45], ""], [88422, "2020-05-11T23:44:04Z", [0.07], ""], [88485, "2020-05-11T22:47:40Z", [0.15], ""], [36054, "2020-05-11T21:12:33Z", [0.3], ""], [88463, "2020-05-11T14:30:09Z", [0.35], ""], [88452, "2020-05-11T14:00:43Z", [0.12], ""], [88328, "2020-05-11T13:59:50Z", [0.2], ""], [45594, "2020-05-11T13:25:34Z", [0.1], ""], [88444, "2020-05-11T09:20:02Z", [0.4], "political survivor"], [88438, "2020-05-11T08:07:42Z", [0.11], ""], [1333, "2020-05-11T07:54:30Z", [0.22], ""], [19127, "2020-05-11T06:40:25Z", [0.11], ""], [1646, "2020-05-10T21:59:33Z", [0.25], ""], [55331, "2020-05-10T14:02:23Z", [0.11], ""], [57778, "2020-05-10T03:01:50Z", [0.2], ""], [88387, "2020-05-09T21:33:25Z", [0.75], ""], [68240, "2020-05-09T16:57:52Z", [0.05], "The court has approved the next government.

The extended period of political deadlock that led up to the election was the result of close races in April and September 2019 that left both incumbent\u00a0Prime Minister\u00a0Benjamin Netanyahu\u00a0and opposition leader\u00a0Benny Gantz unable to muster a 61-seat governing majority, in\u00a0coalition\u00a0with their respective blocs of smaller, ideologically-allied parties.\nThis is not a real good starting ground for Mr. Netanyahu, considering that since December 2016, Netanyahu has been\u00a0under investigation\u00a0for corruption by Israeli police and prosecutors. On 21 November 2019, he was indicted on charges of breach of trust, bribery, and fraud. Due to the indictment, Netanyahu is legally required to relinquish all of his ministry posts other than the prime minister position.\nMeanwhile, the Knesset will discuss Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s request for parliamentary immunity from corruption charges on Thursday next week, the head of a key committee announced Tuesday.

Netanyahu is removed from office by Parliamentary vote after losing his corruption trial\n2. Netanyahu loses in upcoming elections\n3. Netanyahu dies before the question is over I think the odds of 3 are very low. According to Israel\u2019s actuarial tables, the probability of a 70 year old Jewish male dying in the next year is 2% (https://www.cbs.gov.il/he/publications/doclib/2019/1763/t05.pdf).  A quick search of the opinion polls suggest that the political stalemate in Israel is unlikely to be resolved in March. Beyond that it sounds like if a coalition can\u2019t be formed then new elections are held 5 to 6 months later. That would suggest two opportunities (March and again in the Fall) for a resolution on these grounds. I put the odds of a resolution in March at 10% and later in the year at 20% which gives me a 28% chance.  If I assume the result of the election is 50/50 (given how close it is), that\u2019d be an 14% probability.  Basic Law - essentially the constitution for Israel says that the Prime Minister can only be removed from office by a vote after all appeals are exhausted. While this may seem straightforward there is no precedent at the Prime Minister level. At lower minister levels, there is precedent saying that upon indictment, the minister should be removed from office. Either way, this would suggest a prolonged and complicated legal battle that would involve some allegations of the courts meddling in politics. Ultimately, I think the likelihood of a final court decision this year is low, about 15-20%.
