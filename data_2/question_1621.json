The probable loss of most of that revenue will put more pressure on an economy that has already been hit by the twin shocks of the oil price collapse and the pandemic.\n...The current pattern of hajj has been held regularly since the year 630. It has been disrupted for political, economic or health reasons on about 40 occasions, all before the founding of modern Saudi Arabia in 1932, according to a report by the Riyadh-based King Abdulaziz Foundation for Research and Archives.\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/5b2364be-42cb-4973-a10d-52ba62b1b0df\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-29/saudi-prince-mbs-s-vision-2030-confronts-coronavirus-oil-shock 2.  KSA is continuing with full reopening plan by 21 June despite increasing number of cases: \"More than 1,500 mosques in the holy city of Makkah are ready to welcome worshippers on Sunday as a coronavirus curfew is lifted in Saudi Arabia. Mosques have been thoroughly cleaned and sanitised and measures have been put in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Doors and windows will remain open during prayers and prayer spaces have been marked to ensure that worshippers maintain a distance of 2 meters from each other. Although Saudi Arabia will lift a curfew to prevent the spread of COVID-19 on Sunday at 6 a.m., the Umrah pilgrimage and international flights remain suspended.\n...Hadiyah, the Hajj and Umrah charitable organization, in partnership with the Ministry of Islamic Affairs, Dawah and Guidance, earlier launched an initiative to equip mosques that have no maintenance and operation contracts, as well as preparing to apply precautionary and preventive measures to ensure social distancing between worshippers.\nhttps://www.arabnews.com/node/1692961/saudi-arabia\nhttps://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/06/20/saudi-arabia-to-reopen-mecca-mosques-sunday.html 3. Delays in announcing Hajj decisions and Indonesia's restriction on allowing its citizens to go increases KSA's ability to reduce incoming numbers from participating countries and create way to allow for modified pilgrimmage system.  Furthermore, a delay suggests desperation to find a way to make things work; if safety was a greater priority than economy, KSA would have announced a cancelation a week ago, or even a month ago: The kingdom is \"buying time\" as it treads cautiously, the South Asian official said. \"At the last minute if Saudi says 'we are ready to do a full haj', [logistically] many countries will not be in a position\" to participate, he said. Amid an ongoing suspension of international flights, a reduced haj with only local residents is a likely scenario, the official added. A decision to cancel the haj would be a first since the kingdom was founded in 1932. Saudi Arabia managed to hold the pilgrimage during previous outbreaks of Ebola and MERS. But it is struggling to contain the virus amid a serious spike in daily cases and deaths since authorities began easing a nationwide lockdown in late May. In Saudi hospitals, sources say intensive care beds are fast filling up and a growing number of health workers are contracting the virus as the total number of cases has topped 130,000. Deaths surpassed 1,000 on Monday. To counter the spike, authorities this month tightened lockdown restrictions in the city of Jeddah, gateway to the pilgrimage city of Mecca. \nhttps://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/06/16/saudi-faces-perilous-haj-call-as-virus-spikes.html ...\"Possible solutions to the Hajj dilemma, besides cancelling it altogether, might include reducing the number of pilgrims or banning people at high risk of a severe COVID-19 case, in addition to health monitoring, disinfection, and even quarantines. While the majority of Muslim countries are still awaiting the Saudi decision before finalizing their own, some countries, such as Malaysia, Singapore, Cambodia, Thailand, and Brunei, have already announced they will not send any pilgrims this year. In Morocco, 34,000 citizens have been selected to take part in the 2020 Hajj pilgrimage. The future pilgrims have already made payments to the Ministry of Islamic Affairs and to travel agencies for their trip, accommodation, and catering. However, uncertainty will continue to surround their Hajj plans until Moroccan authorities make a decision.\"\nhttps://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2020/06/305926/minister-of-islamic-affairs-no-news-yet-about-2020-hajj-pilgrimage/ 4.  A possible plan has been published and KSA seems to be making a trial of it this week while delaying a formal Hajj announcement, despite having promised a decision by the end of last week: ...\u201cYes, it\u2019s possible to hold hajj this year, but with particular proportions. You have to have manageable numbers,\u201d said Mohsin Tutla, chairperson of the World Hajj and Umrah Care Foundation (WHUC Foundation) that authored the whitepaper \u2018Hajj Under Pandemic Conditions\u2019.  \n...The study also applies a \u201cqualification by filtration\u201d model to come to what it believes is a safe number of pilgrims for a hajj under a pandemic situation. The whitepaper suggests introducing strict measures to mitigate health risks, filter the more vulnerable pilgrims and introduce precautionary measures to hold hajj this year under pandemic conditions. It analyses some of the key issues including the ideal or manageable number of pilgrims that Saudi Arabia should host, how to arrive at that number, the process or method for distributing that number among participating countries, the health risks involved and how to mitigate those. WHUC says it studied the capacity of key touchpoints \u2013 Mina that is constricted to 20 square kilometres, the King Abdulaziz International Airport hajj terminal at 465,000 square metres, Masjid Al Haram with 400,000 square metres \u2013 to suggest the safest number of pilgrims if social distancing is to be followed.  WHUC\u2019s Tutla said \u201c240,000 to 275,000 pilgrims\u201d, 10-12% of the expected total number, is the range that the tent city Mina can handle if social distancing of two metres has to be maintained. He said the question now is how to allocate that number among the participating countries.\n\"https://salaamgateway.com/story/hajj-under-pandemic-conditions-is-possible-says-a-new-study 5. Given the current reopening, it seems minimally likely that KSA will allow Hajj for a limited number of participants within its own borders, certainly from Makkah provice and most likely from other provinces, and it will be less politically challenging for them issue limitations approving the number of participants for their own citizens than it will be for them to determine allocating significantly reduced numbers from participating countries still open to coming. ...Tutla accepts that everything will depend on what the health situation in Makkah would be. He believes there could be a few possible scenarios:\n- Hajj could be held with maximum participation from around the world, or\n- Hajj could be just with Saudi participation, or\n- Hajj with just Makkah participation, or\n- A symbolic diplomatic participation of hajj missions from around the world.\n\u201cThese are the four options. The fifth option is to cancel it but we know they're never going to cancel hajj,\u201d he said, adding that even if one man stands on hajj, it will be considered hajj.\n\"https://salaamgateway.com/story/hajj-under-pandemic-conditions-is-possible-says-a-new-study https://www.arabnews.com/node/1692821/saudi-arabia\nhttps://gulfnews.com/world/gulf/saudi/covid-19-strict-precautions-as-saudi-beauty-salons-back-to-business-1.72167989\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/06/18/saudi-arabias-crown-prince-uses-travel-restrictions-consolidate-power/"], [28899, "2020-06-21T09:55:19Z", [0.0, 0.3, 0.0, 0.7], ""], [88928, "2020-06-21T07:43:10Z", [0.0, 0.4, 0.17, 0.43], ""], [28153, "2020-06-21T07:16:38Z", [0.0, 0.45, 0.05, 0.5], ""], [90486, "2020-06-21T04:09:34Z", [0.0, 0.6, 0.0, 0.4], "If they're going to do it, I believe it will be very soon due to the arrangements.

The Saudi Ministry of Health reported 4,301 new cases on Friday, taking the total to 150,292, with 1,184 deaths. The country hit more than 100,000 cases on June 7. The number of new infections has continued to rise in recent weeks, as authorities began phasing out restrictions on movement and travel on May 28. The restrictions were imposed in March to help curb the spread of the virus. Authorities announced last month that the nationwide curfew would be lifted completely on June 21, with the exception of the holy city of Mecca and Jeddah. Saudi Arabia is considering drastically limiting numbers at the annual haj pilgrimage to prevent a further outbreak of coronavirus cases, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier this month.

Hajj was not cancelled during any of the modern wars:\n- 40 cancellations of hajj since 639 - 2% chance that it happens due to external factors (mainly war) in any given year since then\n- Out of the 40 cancellations, 9 were due to plague (22.5% of all cancellations, 0.6% chance hajj canceled due to plague)\n- The Hajj was last closed in 1798 - 1801 due to Napoleon's war in Middle East (https://www.arabnews.com/node/1653191/saudi-arabia) The last few global pandemics did not cause SA to cancel or suspend hajj, but put travel restrictions and encouraged certain segments of the population to postpone their hajj: \n- SARS (2002): Restrictions (http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Riyadh-fears-new-SARS,-restricts-visas-for-Hajj-28497.html)\n- H1N1 (2009): Restrictions (http://www.nbcnews.com/id/34193091/ns/world_news-mideast_n_africa/t/saudi-official-dead-swine-flu-hajj/)\n- MERS (2012/2013): Restrictions (https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2013/07/who-issues-mers-travel-advice-new-case-reported) However, SARS and MERS had fewer global cases and were considered to have less impact and governmental intervention compared to COVID. H1N1 seems to have the most number of cases, and should be studied in more detail below:\n- SARS cases: 8,098; Number of deaths: 744 (https://www.healthline.com/health-news/how-deadly-is-the-coronavirus-compared-to-past-outbreaks#2009-(H1N1)-flu-pandemic)\n- H1N1 cases: 700m - 1.4b; Number of deaths: 18,449 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_swine_flu_pandemic)\n- MERS cases : 2,494; Number of deaths: 858 (https://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/) Timeline of H1N1 seems to indicate lower number of cases during Hajj month and thus more less probability that Saudi Arabia would cancel or suspend Hajj:\n- May 1 - 31, 2009: Cases increased from 367 to 15,501\n- June 1 - 30, 2009: Cases increased from 17,398 to 70,893 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_flu_pandemic_table_June_2009)\n- July 1 - 31, 2009: Cases increased from 77,201 to 183,590 Ultimately, decision lies with Saudi Arabia if they want to cancel or suspend Hajj. There is no highest religious authority that can make a decision (similar to a pope), and the situation will need to be judged on how widespread COVID19 is in Saudi Arabia or religious travelers from Muslim countries and if they will impose a travel restriction on tourists.\n- Saudi Arabia will be easing movement controls by June 21, positive signal that they will not suspend or cancel Hajj (https://www.straitstimes.com/world/middle-east/saudi-arabia-to-end-coronavirus-curfew-on-june-21-except-in-mecca). Domestic flights will continue, but ban on international flights. Positive weight on not cancelling Hajj but restricting travelers by making it harder for them to travel to the site \n- Globally, countries are using the strategy of quarantining travelers for 14 days if they choose to enter the country. Saudi Arabia will likely (>90%) follow global standards in using this method to ensure that religious travelers are not COVID carriers\n- Another point to consider is the economic impact of Hajj, which contributes 7% of GDP (20% of non-oil GDP). Strong economic reason to keep Hajj available during the period as long as quarantine measures are being met (https://www.trtworld.com/middle-east/how-important-is-the-umrah-pilgrimage-for-the-saudi-economy-34163)\n- However, MBS has made multiple missteps on the global stage (OPEC price war, Khashoggi, detainment of royals) and might be pressured by the international community to postpone Hajj. This factor will be greatly influenced by what WHO's message will be during the next few months - will they be ok with cities reopening? or will they push for more lockdowns"], [85449, "2020-05-30T01:10:16Z", [0.07, 0.5, 0.0, 0.43], ""], [38094, "2020-05-30T01:05:44Z", [0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5], "There are 30 days in June, if I am diligent, I'll move 2 points from bucket #2 to bucket #4 each day."], [1034, "2020-05-29T21:07:40Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [85725, "2020-05-29T19:19:57Z", [0.06, 0.82, 0.12, 0.0], ""], [60695, "2020-05-29T19:13:54Z", [0.0, 0.75, 0.25, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2020-05-29T19:06:06Z", [0.05, 0.65, 0.05, 0.25], ""], [691, "2020-05-29T18:44:57Z", [0.12, 0.54, 0.08, 0.26], ""], [85073, "2020-05-29T18:23:17Z", [0.02, 0.38, 0.0, 0.6], ""], [88858, "2020-05-29T16:31:15Z", [0.01, 0.54, 0.05, 0.4], ""], [87064, "2020-05-29T15:28:37Z", [0.01, 0.46, 0.0, 0.53], ""], [79591, "2020-05-29T14:05:20Z", [0.03, 0.4, 0.0, 0.57], ""], [87889, "2020-05-29T13:33:52Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.09, 0.81], ""], [87064, "2020-05-29T12:23:09Z", [0.05, 0.42, 0.0, 0.53], ""], [85449, "2020-05-29T09:02:59Z", [0.23, 0.44, 0.0, 0.33], "450,000 is a lot of pilgrims to quietly repatriate over 5 days & implies that with international flights still suspended, Saudi won't be opening up to overseas pilgrims again any time soon.

The first phase, to begin this Thursday, May 28, will revise the 24-hour state-wide curfew to 3:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. The country plans to lift domestic travel bans, open mosques, and resume workplace attendance on May 31 and expects to lift the state of emergency on June 21.  However, the more than 1.5 million people residing in Islam\u2019s holiest city will remain under a 24-hour curfew until June 21.

The ministry earlier said it would decide by May 20.   The decision to wait a bit longer follows communications between President Joko Widodo and Saudi Arabia\u2019s King Salman bin Abdulaziz, ministry spokesperson Oman Fathurahman told Salaam Gateway. According to the spokesperson, President Joko Widodo discussed with Saudi authorities the different possibilities for this year\u2019s haj season, and then urged the religious affairs ministry to postpone any decision until June 1 in case of any developments. Some countries, including neighbouring Singapore, have already decided not to send their pilgrims for the haj this year, citing health and safety reasons. \u201cWe hope Saudi Arabia will make a decision on this season\u2019s haj immediately. Whether it will be cancelled, or if it continues with a limited quota of pilgrims, or if it will restrict any specific ages or countries, or if it continues normally,\u201d said Oman. He said there will not be enough time to make all necessary preparations if Saudi Arabia makes a decision after early June. \u201cWe need the decision as soon as possible as the time for the haj season is arriving and we need to make many preparations that usually must be completed 25 days before the start of the pilgrimage.\u201d The ministry is currently still processing the pilgrims\u2019 haj payments and finishing boarding preparations for health inspections and protocols but it has postponed any new contracts and stopped receiving down payments for pilgrim services such as accommodation, catering, and transportation. Oman said the quota for Indonesia\u2019s pilgrims this year is  221,000. 203,320 are regular pilgrims and 17,680 are pilgrims on special visas that are issued directly by Saudi Arabia. \u201cWe, along with commission VI of the house of representatives, have  already agreed on three possible scenarios: if the haj continues normally there will be tighter health checks, if the haj continues but with limitations there will be sorting to determine which citizens are eligible, and for the worst case if the haj is halted, we will refund pilgrims and carry forward all [of this year\u2019s] pilgrims to automatically become priority for next year in our SISKOHAT [haj] system,\u201d said Oman.

Mecca is still under strict lockdown & a new phase of national lockdown to coincide with Eid was announced some days ago.  With a spike in new cases over the last couple of days it seems likely more announcements including cancellation of the Hajj will follow.  The question is therefore of political timing.  While it seems unlikely that Saudi will drag out decision making as per Japan & the Olympics, there may be some advantage in allowing partially restricted business to continue as usual during Ramadan then announcing the cancellation immediately after Eid once the seasonal increase in spending is completed but in time to be seen to be protecting older generations in a culture where this is of great importance.  This move would allow the government to consolidate the economic hit and potentially time the announcement of the cancellation to precede or coincide with the death spike that corresponds to the current rise in new cases, depending on the specific point of infection at which these cases are being detected.   Since, as @cafebedouin has said, the pilgrimage begins in late June & resources spent preparing for it will be needlessly wasted unless it goes ahead, this factor is, again, pushing me towards anticipating a relatively early cancellation either at the end of May or the beginning of June."], [86678, "2020-05-18T22:33:25Z", [0.79, 0.18, 0.03, 0.0], ""], [86246, "2020-05-18T22:33:24Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "Based on the clarification \"An announcement of restrictions without a cancellation or suspension would not count.\"  KSA can not cancel the Hajj for several reasons.
