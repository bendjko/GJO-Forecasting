See here for more info: https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/841007 Other judgments: \n- EWP estimate at 8.8%. [1] \n- Crowd forecast here is 0%. Inside view: \n- in their 2017 report, EWP were particularly concerned about the 2018 election [2] There was indeed violence, but clearly less than 100 people seem to have been killed. [3] There seems to be ongoing political violence. [4] . Here is a good background. [5] From what I can tell most of the violence is non-lethal (so far).\n- The country has seen constant and increasing economic growth over the past decades [6] Overall judgment:\n- without the election as a flash point, I think there is very little risk of Bangladesh experiencing such an episode of mass killing. I'd guess 1% for unknown unknowns.
