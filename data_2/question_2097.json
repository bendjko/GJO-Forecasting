In particular, the US killed https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qasem_Soleimani:\n- I think it was probably a good move, and it reminded me of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Luis_Carrero_Blanco, the prophylactic assassination of one of the likely heirs of Franco (the Spanish dictator), which might have contributed to Spain becoming a democracy sooner\n- But I don't think that Biden would make such a move today. Or generally, Biden seems to be less partisan towards Israel than Trump, which might make Israel more bellicose (?). To make this explicit, if the opportunity to kill Soleimani had arised this year, it seems plausible that Biden would not have taken it, but that Israel would have instead.

In addition, Iran has been severely critical of Bahrain for hosting the United States Fifth Fleet within the Persian Gulf at the Naval Support Activity Bahrain base\nAfter the Saudi diplomatic missions in Iran were ransacked by Iranian protesters following the execution of Nimr al-Nimr, Bahrain followed Saudi Arabia's decision by severing diplomatic relations with Iran on January 4, 2016.[1] On 16 April 2019, a court in Bahrain sentenced 139 people to prison for forming terrorist groups backed by Iran. A total of 169 were arrested\nOn September 11, 2020, Bahrain announced it would establish official ties with Israel. The surprising normalization attempt by Bahrain has prompted anger from the Iranian leadership, as many Iranian officials openly denounced the deal and accused Bahrain of working with Zionist groups ## Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\nhttps://www.wikiwand.com/en/Iran\u2013Saudi_Arabia_relations\nIran and Saudi Arabia have no diplomatic relations following the attack on the Saudi embassy in Tehran in January 2016 after Saudi Arabia executed Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, a Shia cleric. Bilateral relations between the countries have been strained over several geopolitical issues such as the interpretations of Islam, aspirations for leadership of the Islamic world, oil export policy and relations with the United States and other Western countries. \nIn the Syrian Civil War, Iran has supported the Syrian government militarily and with billions of dollars of aid, while Saudi Arabia was a major supplier of aid to rebel groups. Both countries have accused each other of support for terrorism.[2][3] Iran and Saudi Arabia are both mixed up in the strive for dominance of their region\nThe major general of Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Qasem Soleimani was assassinated in a targeted American drone strike on 3 January 2020 in Baghdad airport, when he was invited by Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi as a mediator to talk about Iran's response to a previous message from Saudi Arabia related to normalization of relationship between the two nations.  ## Sultanate of Oman\nIran\u2013Oman relations are bilateral relations between Oman and Iran. The two countries currently share diplomatic and economic ties dating back to the Pahlavi period. Oman considers Iran not to be a threat perceived by the other Arab states of the Persian Gulf.[citation needed] Both countries are members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, the Non-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77. Iran has an embassy in Muscat whilst Oman has an embassy in Tehran.\nThough on two occasions the U.S. has dispatched high-level officials to discuss Iran with Oman, the fact that Oman has avoided publicly expressing any concerns regarding Iran's nuclear program is likely a reason why the two states have managed to maintain strong ties. \nIn addition to strong diplomatic and political ties, Iran and Oman cooperate economically on several fronts, including energy. Most recently, the Gulf neighbors signed an initial agreement to begin supplying large quantities of natural gas from Iran to Oman, a project that was earlier reported to be worth between $7\u201312 billion ## State of Qatar\nhttps://www.wikiwand.com/en/Iran%E2%80%93Qatar_relations\nDuring the 2017 Qatar diplomatic crisis, Iran provided diplomatic and economic support to Qatar.[17] On June 5, the day that the crisis erupted, Iran asked the Arab nations to settle their dispute through dialogue.[18\nAfter Saudi Arabia and its Persian Gulf allies blocked Qatar economically, Iran sent food supplies, amounting to 1,100 tons of fruit and vegetables and 66 tons of beef, to Qatar on a daily basis\nOn 26 August 2018, during a phone conversation between Emir of Qatar and Iranian President Rouhani, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani stated that \u201cThanks to the integrity and solidarity of Qatari people and cooperation and help of friend countries, especially Iran, we have overcome the issues of the unjust, cruel siege and we will never forget Iran\u2019s stances in this regard.\u201d\nProbability of conflict: ~0% ## State of Kuwait\nhttps://www.wikiwand.com/en/Iran%E2%80%93Kuwait_relations\nKuwait describes its relations with Iran as \"excellent and historical\". ## Israel\nhttps://www.wikiwand.com/en/Iran\u2013Israel_relations\nhttps://www.wikiwand.com/en/Iran%E2%80%93Israel_proxy_conflict#/Attacks_on_ships_and_incidents_in_2021 On several occasions between 2013 and 2017 Israel reportedly carried out or supported attacks on Hezbollah and Iranian targets within Syrian territories or Lebanon\nOne of the first reliably reported incidents took place on 30 January 2013, when Israeli aircraft struck a Syrian convoy allegedly transporting Iranian weapons to Hezbollah.[133] Habitually, Israel refused to comment on the incident, a stance that is believed to seek to ensure that the Syrian government did not feel obliged to retaliate.[133]\nBeginning in January 2017, the Israeli Air Force began flying almost daily attack missions against Iranian targets in Syria, dropping about 2,000 bombs in 2018 alone\nIn June and July 2020, a series of explosions targeted Iran's nuclear and missile programs and various other infrastructure. There were accidents and damages reported in the Parchin military complex near Tehran on 26 June, the Sina At'har clinic in northern Tehran on 30 June,[150] the Natanz nuclear facility on 2 July, the Shahid Medhaj power plant (Zargan) in Ahvaz and the Karun petrochemical center in the city of Mahshahr on 4 July. It has been speculated that Israel was involved,[151] and the damage at the centrifuge plant in Natanz alone could delay the Iranian nuclear weapons program by one or two years, according to intelligence officials\nIsraeli commandos carried out attacks which damaged numerous Iranian cargo ships carrying oil and weapons to Syria from late 2019 to 2021.[163] Israeli-owned ships were attacked in the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea, allegedly by Iran.[164] Israel was also reportedly behind an attack on an Iranian intelligence ship of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy in the Red Sea, which was heavily damaged by a limpet mine in April 2021\nOverall, these are surprisingly non-lethal *** Overall, my read of the situation is that Iran is in a worse defensive position and doesn't necessarily want to escalate. Saudi Arabia and Israel kinda do want to escalate the conflict, but the US really wouldn't. Although the whole region is a landmine, the period is also fairly short.
