March was 3.9%. It is well reported April was up 69%, which would be 6.59% for April. May is projected to be 8-10%, which would put the three month average between the 6-7% range. May would have to be above 10.45% for the average to go above 7%, which I find unlikely because it makes more sense for most of the unemployment claims to be in the first month of the lockdown. The lockdown started the last week of March. In the US initial jobless claims peaked the second week of the lockdown and dropped every week after that. So it is unlikely the UK May jump will be more than the UK April jump. I am giving the above 7% category a little extra credit because I don't want to underestimate the impact of the virus and because I thought we were heading into a global recession before the virus even hit. https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/07/uk-economy-to-shrink-by-25-percent-and-unemployment-to-double-warns-bank-of-england-coronavirus\nhttps://www.focus-economics.com/country-indicator/united-kingdom/unemployment"], [1333, "2020-05-31T14:54:41Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.96], ""], [88874, "2020-05-31T13:23:57Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [87064, "2020-05-31T09:36:39Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [86000, "2020-05-31T01:45:20Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.35, 0.55], ""], [31275, "2020-05-30T21:52:30Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.27, 0.73], ""], [79464, "2020-05-30T19:20:54Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.01, 0.98], ""], [1333, "2020-05-30T17:50:49Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.04, 0.95], ""], [88013, "2020-05-30T16:44:56Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.75], ""], [57778, "2020-05-30T10:37:09Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.29, 0.7], ""], [87064, "2020-05-30T07:32:39Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [84880, "2020-05-30T04:29:07Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.01, 0.98], ""], [38094, "2020-05-30T01:39:15Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "A day to go and I'll go all in."], [62808, "2020-05-29T21:10:12Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [75863, "2020-05-29T21:06:55Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.03, 0.22, 0.75], "\"Ministers have told the Financial Times that Mr Sunak and prime minister Boris Johnson are planning a big stimulus package, expected to be announced before the summer, amid warnings that Britain\u2019s jobless rate may soon hit 10 per cent of the workforce.\" https://www.ft.com/content/425f4baa-ab57-44a5-93ee-8a90a856789e\n"], [87064, "2020-05-29T20:56:31Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [11286, "2020-05-29T19:54:33Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.8], ""], [31251, "2020-05-29T18:12:50Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.03, 0.23, 0.74], ""], [88858, "2020-05-29T16:57:19Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.65, 0.35, 0.0], ""], [87107, "2020-05-29T16:42:26Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.8], ""], [87064, "2020-05-29T15:16:10Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [88849, "2020-05-29T13:18:12Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.4, 0.6], ""], [87064, "2020-05-29T11:37:13Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [88452, "2020-05-29T09:22:29Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [88766, "2020-05-29T09:00:43Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.4, 0.6], ""], [88766, "2020-05-29T08:59:39Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.6, 0.3], ""], [13657, "2020-05-29T08:50:55Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [86429, "2020-05-29T08:32:15Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.09, 0.91], "Bank of England talking about potential doubling of unemployment rate in second quarter."], [87064, "2020-05-29T06:06:50Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [87064, "2020-05-29T06:03:33Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [73436, "2020-05-28T22:36:30Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [88840, "2020-05-28T20:29:04Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [691, "2020-05-28T15:29:16Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.21, 0.79], ""], [1333, "2020-05-28T13:12:57Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.94], ""], [87064, "2020-05-28T12:18:42Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [87064, "2020-05-28T11:54:32Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [87064, "2020-05-28T11:40:56Z", [0.0, 0.03, 0.9, 0.06, 0.01], "Comment deleted on May 28, 2020 11:50AM UTC"], [57778, "2020-05-28T10:44:54Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.35, 0.64], ""], [80764, "2020-05-28T10:15:12Z", [0.0, 0.02, 0.36, 0.44, 0.18], "Last adjustment, before the question ends.

Note that the most data for this survey was collected prior to the lockdown. It's also important to read section 3 about how anyone who works at least one hour or is expecting to return to a job (includes furloughed workers) do not count as unemployed: \"The International Labour Organization (ILO) definition of employment includes those who worked in a job for at least one hour and those temporarily absent from a job. Workers furloughed under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme or who are self-employed but temporarily not in work have a reasonable expectation of returning to their jobs after a temporary period of absence. Therefore they are classified as employed under the ILO definition.\" It's also very important to note that given the question will resolve based on Mar-Jun, it will include in its average the March numbers, which we know from the recently published Single-Month unemployment rate estimate for March [2] was 3.7%. So, as an example, even if real unemployment in the single month of April jumps to 7% and May jumps to 10%, the unemployment average over that period would still be below the highest bin, at 6.9%. HOWEVER, a Berenberg analyst suggests a rise to 9.5% in late second quarter from the 3.9% for the period ending in March [3]. I read that 9.5% number to mean the June numbers to be published in the Apr-Jun report, since 3.9% is the same as the Jan-Mar report released today. Assuming the growth is linear between the period ending in March and the period ending in Jun, that would mean the reports would look something like this: Jan-Mar | 3.9%\nFeb-Apr | 5.8%\nMar-May | 7.6%\nApr-Jun | 9.5% In this case, the correct answer for this question would be 7.6%, which puts us in the highest bin. That would be pretty alarming - it would suggest that even when averaged with March's ~3.7% single-month rate, April and May's single month numbers would have to be an average of ~10%, so perhaps 8% and 12% or something like that. If, however, the analyst is talking about single-month metrics, then maybe the figures above would instead be  Mar | 3.9%\nApr | 5.8%\nMay | 7.6%\nJun | 9.5% in which case the average for Mar-May would be 5.8%. I'm going to lean toward the former, interpreting the analyst as speaking about the Jun report suggesting that the rate will be closer to 7.6% in the Mar-May report. We should be able to narrow it down once we get the Feb-Apr numbers on June 16th. I'm revising my forecast upward, but still leaving some in the middle and mid-to-high bin.

Assuming we have ~34 million as the base of people able to work, then we would only need to have ~2.38 million unemployed people to get above 7.0%. In reference to official statistics, Berenberg indicates that the unemployment rate was ~3.9% in March, ~6.0% in April and expects it to be ~9.5% for May [4].  That said, I'm still conflicted about the probabilities here. I've just realized I I'm lacking crucial knowledge about the way the three-month unemployment rate will be estimated eventually. Do they take averages? If so, the average of the three months will be close to 7.0% but not above 7.0%. Or do they only count the totals of those unemployed at the end of May? Then the rate is in fact above 7.0%. Maybe someone can enlighten me?

So can assume a base rate of around 4%. Unemployed people are defined as those aged 16 or over who are without work, available to start work in the next two weeks and who have either: a) been actively seeking work in the past four weeks, or. b) are waiting to start a new job they have already obtained. The UK has put in place significant support measures for companies, allowing them to furlough staff and the gov will pay up to 80% of their wages. Anybody in this situation will not count as unemployed in the stats as they are not actively seeking alternative work. The same applies for the self-employed.  We can assume that faced with difficult economic prospects most firms and self-employed will simply seek to temporarily cease all or parts of operations, allowing employees to access these funds and avoid unemployment. Where we will see increased unemployment is where firms actually become insolvent. I've been unable to find any evidence of increasing insolvencies. Firms most susceptible to this will be ones where a significant proportion of expenses aren't wages. So will fall hardest on the non-service sector. But these sectors are ones the government is prioritising for support - construction, food supply, transport. So we can assume the government will prop up a significant proportion.  So we conclude that unemployment as defined and measured by ONS won't see a huge change. However, there are currently 1.34 million unemployed and 32.99m employed. It would only take 1% of those employed to lose their jobs to lead to a 1ppt rise in the unemployment rate.  We therefore conclude there is virtually no possiblity of unemployment being below 4% the current rate and only a slightly higher probability of it being above 7%.  The most likely outcome seems to be it woudl be within 4% and 6%. We estimate it is twice as likely it is higher than 5%.

The large majority of Furloughed staff, both PAYE and Self employed will not count towards unemployment stats. Those self employed with a UTR number will also not count, as there claim would be based on working on the reference date which I believe to be February 28th.

I expect current lockdown will continue for the duration of this question and given the economic package announced I don't expect another surge like we've seen with the initial spike. I think the crowd is underestimating the chance of a 6-7% unemployment rate as data suggests that is the current level however I accept there is the capacity for this figure to grow - even if not as much as the initial spike and this would take it over to the 7% figure. Given the post GFE baserate of unemployment being over 7% in the UK is quite high and adjusting for this extraordinary scenario I make 7% or over the most likely outcome but between 6-7% also being feasible.
