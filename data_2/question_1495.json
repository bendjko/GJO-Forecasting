Brief reminder: this q is equal in probability to whether the Dems will win the election, and that probability is 98%, 1% to account for tail events caused by Biden or Trump's death and 1% for me being spectacularly wrong. I think chess and forecasting have many similarities. When your opponent does a move in chase that doesn't make obvious sense, you have to work out their plan to confirm if you or they made the mistake. This week, Trump 1) suffering from a collapse in support for his Covid 19 strategy caught Covid 19, paraded himself in a car, claimed he has some kind of magic immunity and claimed he is not infectious; and 2) being behind in the polls and so needs as many \"key moments\" as possible to catch up refused to take part in a debate because it is virtual. Why is Trump doing this? Is Trump making the mistake? Or am I? 1) To me, his actions are obviously losing. A clear demonstration of how incompetent he is at understanding and dealing with Covid 19 will not improve perceptions of his Covid competence. Despite his brovado, there is still about an 8% chance he might be dead in a month. It is also medically impossible for him to not be deeply contagious right now. What is he thinking? What is clear is Trump has no interest in convincing America he is the right man to lead for Covid by demonstrating a mastery of facts. Instead, he is trying to pretend he is some kind of superman, as if the laws of epidemiology don't apply to him. Sure, he might be dead in a month. In which case nothing lost by this rhetoric. But if he lives he can and is claiming some kind of divine power making him survive.  So Trump is assuming he will not die (fair enough). And trying to make the fact that he doesn't die a big deal. There seems to be two themes in his propaganda. A) a religious \"chosen one\" perception, justified by his talking of miracles. Why would he do that? Well, he's trying to appeal to evangelicals, part of his core base. Imagine how motivated they will be if they believe Trump suffered a near death experience and was immune to it similarly (but clearly not identical) to Jesus?  And B) Trump is very strong and won't be stopped by a disease even Covid. This seems to be his main angle. Essentially, he is judging his manhood by his ability for his immune system to manage Covid. This seems to be more than propaganda but about his own personal sense of manhood, but he is assuming many in his base will think Trump is a real man by refusing to take a day off sick for an apparently minor disease. I can see how those who have not lost loved ones who want a \"strong\" leader with many man points to lead them.  The problem with B is that it is weak not strong to be unable to admit when you have a big disease. Just like it is weak not strong to be unable to own up to your mistakes or take any responsibility for your actions. When I do these things, I have to face down the demons of cowardice that make me want to back down and do the wrong thing to find an easy way out. I have for as long as I can remember found a way to overcome that cowardice and do the brave right thing.  But I also know many people have not made that personal journey and still fear taking responsibility and finding strength in admitting their fallibility. For these people, they think people will judge them badly if they admit they got ill.  And sure some people will be impressed by this. But the vast majority will not, and most will find his attempts to cover up his Covid sickness disgusting. But for people who lack the courage to take responsibility, they will never even think people will think that way. They see it as a a game of manliness. That game may have worked when he was 12. But as an adult campaigning for president? I'm sure there are many people in his core base who think it still works. But even in his base, many have grown up. And isn't a core conservative value about taking responsibility? The right are supposed to treasure that far more than the left. So even among his base, it's not going to be a winner. It's just a baby thinking baby things matter in a majority Adult conversation. And even this is too generous to Trump because it ignores that over half the electorate are women, who are less impressed by anti-factual macho male antics.  This explanation for why Trump is doing this makes sense, so I conclude I am right and Trump has indeed made a blunder.  But what about B) Why would Trump ditch a debate when his campaign is losing and badly needs these moments? To see my suggested answer, we must first consider the first debate. Biden spent a long time preparing. Trump did not. But Trump obviously must have had a strategy. We then got the debate. And Trump interrupted Biden all the time and made America a global laughing stock by the worst televised debate in history. But this was Trump's strategy. He knows he can't win on the detail, and rule-breaking bullying is his thing. So spoiling the debate was most likely his core strategy.  It also goes back to his \"strong man\" persona he seems to be trying to put forward because he thinks it wins votes. What happens next? The debate commission propose a format that, because Trump caught Covid, means Trump will find it harder to spoil the debate. And all of a sudden, the entirety of his preparation and planning disappears.  So Trump has two choices. i) fight a debate that he knows he can't win. Even if he tried to debate via normal non-cheating methods, he would have had to start preparing many weeks ago to stand a chance. Trump committed everything to his cheating strategy. And even though he lost the debate (according to the polls) and his poll rating started to plummet, this was his one and only strategy. ii) Not take part in the debate and restore man pride via claiming some kind of conspiracy. It seems from this the obvious move is ii. So I don't think Trump was trying to simply exchange probability of winning a fair election for probability of stealing an election via a violent coup. Instead, it seems Trump's bad move of avoiding the debate is simply the least bad move he could make given his core debating strategy for which he has past the point of no return. It follows his approach is not actually as bad as it first appears, but is simply his least worst move. I conclude Trump has not seen something I haven't. On A, it is the opposite and on B Trump doesn't have any better options. My forecast therefore remains 0% chance of Trump victory if neither Trump nor Biden dies and I am not spectacularly wrong."], [91598, "2020-10-08T22:45:22Z", [0.9], ""], [26666, "2020-10-08T21:18:58Z", [0.97], ""], [96318, "2020-10-08T21:00:05Z", [0.91], ""], [1305, "2020-10-08T20:10:32Z", [0.6], ""], [92331, "2020-10-08T19:25:22Z", [0.9], ""], [95117, "2020-10-08T19:22:26Z", [0.91], ""], [88743, "2020-10-08T16:27:58Z", [0.91], ""], [88098, "2020-10-08T16:24:10Z", [0.91], ""], [95867, "2020-10-08T14:34:10Z", [0.91], ""], [52772, "2020-10-08T13:54:16Z", [0.91], ""], [884, "2020-10-08T13:31:45Z", [0.9], ""], [87897, "2020-10-08T13:31:34Z", [0.91], ""], [75863, "2020-10-08T13:27:19Z", [0.91], ""], [95168, "2020-10-08T12:34:04Z", [0.65], ""], [60948, "2020-10-08T08:24:28Z", [0.91], "This forecast was programmatically produced by taking the (deluxe) 538 prediction and making a calibration adjustment unless this brought probability to <10%.

I was going to update my forecast today inline with reduced chance of Trump or Biden death now that we are only 1 month away. But then Trump got Covid and then debated with Biden for about 1h30m.  Brief summary of previous forecast: \nProbability : 98%\n0% chance of Trump victory in the popular vote so this question is equal in probability to who will win the election. \n0% chance Trump can win the election against Biden.\n1% chance Trump wins due to me being spectacularly wrong\n<0.5% chance of Trump winning by either Biden or Trump dying, which I round up to 1%. Total 98%.  Update:\nSo far, the election seems to be going down exactly the scenarios I had forecast: \na bad hurricain that made no difference;\ndebates, DNCs and RNCs that made no difference;\nCovid 19 has started raging again just before the election;\nTrump's campaign is poor relative to Biden's; THE BIG CHANGE\nTrump has Covid.\nBut this also corresponds to events I considered and forecast, essentially my post dated Aug 13, 2020 06:08PM, where I considered the chances of death of both candidates. I did this with Covid 19 in mind but also simply the old age of both candidates.\nOverall summary: If Trump dies, the probability the GOP wins is 5%. And the probability Trump dies is 2.5%. Total probability of GOP win from Trump dying = 2% * 5% = 0.1%. If Biden dies, the probability the GOP wins is 5% and the probability Biden dies is 2.5%. Total probability of GOP win from Biden dying = 2.5% * 5% = 0.125.  So we just need to revise the probability to include Trump's chances of death. Trump is 74. Mortality by age of Covid is as below.\nhttps://ourworldindata.org/mortality-risk-covid#case-fatality-rate-of-covid-19-by-age\nThis graph gives 4 different locations. But South Korea, China and Italy were mostly impacted early on before we knew as much as we did today while Spain has had a longer impact closer to today's probability. Similarly, Trump's ethnicity (which we know impacts mortality) is closer to Spain. So Spain seems the best choice. Trump also has the best medical assistance money can buy, but beyond close monitoring there is not much money can do against Covid. In addition, the graph shows age boundaries of 70-80 and Trump is close to the middle. \nSo we choose the 4.8% chance of death. The new probability of the GOP winning the election via Trump dying is 0.24%. But Biden may also have Covid 19 due to the debate. Lets look at the picture. \nhttps://www.cleveland.com/coronavirus/2020/09/trump-biden-skip-handshakes-social-distance-at-podiums-for-debate-in-shadow-of-coronavirus-pandemic.html\nBiden was about 3m or so away. The evidence suggests being within 1m for 15m indoors gives a reasonable chance of catching the virus (say 50%). The room had very high ceiling though so was closer to outdoors, except no breeze, so we assume the Covid spread in a sphere rather than a circle. And Trump never shouted or sung, so no adjustment needed for that. And the debate was 1h30m = 6 times longer than 15m. The probablity is therefore 50% * 1^2 / 3^3 * 6 = 66%. Divide it by 2 because Trump was early in the Covid cycle by then, so we get about 33%.  I know, this is very rough and ready, but some justification is better than none.  Probability of Biden's death at 77 if he has Covid is probability a bit higher than the 5% because he is a bit higher than the medium age, so we will go for 8%. New probability Biden dies is .33*.08 = 2.6%, which is about the same as it was before. So the new probability of GOP winning the election via Biden dying is 0.132%. Finally, we ignore the probability of both Trump and Biden dying because it's second order. Hence the probability of GOP winning by either Trump or Biden dying despite Covid 19 remains <0.5%. Okay, so if deaths will not impact my forecast, what about the political impact on the campaign? Some may feel sympathetic to Trump. But most people I think will blame him for his super spreader events in which he caught it. And while he will get some sympathy, I don't think anybody will rally around to him because of it. At the very least it won't help him.  In addition, he loses at least one of the three debates, which reduces his chances of catching up even further, not that the debates would make much difference given the poll volatilty. Conclusion, no impact on the outcome of the campaign either.  So my forecast remains at 98%."], [172, "2020-10-02T12:06:52Z", [1.0], ""], [86233, "2020-10-02T07:45:02Z", [0.78], ""], [89005, "2020-10-02T05:31:43Z", [0.3], ""], [96183, "2020-10-02T05:19:50Z", [0.8], ""], [88569, "2020-10-02T02:13:34Z", [0.95], ""], [94632, "2020-10-02T01:32:15Z", [0.93], "Equivalent to my most recent projection for a Dem win overall.

To answer this question, I've divided each of those possibilities according to how likely they are to be accompanied by a popular vote win.  In Biden's case, there seems to be a negligible chance of winning the EC without also winning the popular vote (i.e. < 1%). In Trumps case, 3 out of the last 4 republican presidential EC wins have come despite the loss of the popular vote.

I have a chance to update my forecast. I decline to change it. The new events: No significant Biden Bounce after the democratic convention. Donald Trump presents a story in the republican convention that if I'm an idiot I could believe. Polls in swing states seem to be narrowing. Kamala Harris delivers great responses on Twitter to Trump's speech.  So why does my probability not change? Firstly, we have to remember, GJOpen only permits units of 1%. If you change by 0.0003 %, or even 0.3%, that means 0 in terms of prediction. Next, if we look at a normal distribution, if you are 5 sigma away from the mean, and you close in 1 sigma, you have indeed moved decisively, but in %age terms, you have only moved from 3x10-7 to 99.9%. Of coarse it's a big step forward, but in terms of probability, it matters little. Even a move from 4 sigma to 3 sigma is a move from 99.9% to 99.7%. And this move is still 0 given the unit of 1% imposed by this website. A move from 3 sigma to 2 sigma, however, is within the granularity of this website, and registers as about 5%.  So what has really changed here.  Lets start with my original position. I made in Jul 31, 2020 01:25AM. I made 10 points.  In terms of polling, point 1 was not just about polling lead about about the volatility caused mostly by polarisation creating an historically low number of people prepared to change their mind. And point 7 was about Covid killing people who would not then go on and thank via a vote Trump for killing them or their  loved ones.  And point 8 was about Trump the man being incurably incompetent.  So, assuming an historically low volatility, the natural prediction would be there would be a very low Biden bounce after the DNC followed by a very low Trump bounce after the RNC.  So facts right now is very little DNC bounce. But there was a bounce. People didn't change their minds who to vote for. But they did improve their support of Biden personally. Given the polarisation and low volatility, making those who already support Biden more committed to vote for him is about as good as one could get and in terms of voting outcomes is just as much a win as a normal bounce because those wavering now need more convincing to waver back to Trump.  Further, polls apparently show most people like Biden's speech. So Biden has created an obstacle Trump has to overcome for Trump to win back more votes, which still matters even if it is not shown in the absolute polling numbers. Although, I'm aware the counter-question is whether I'm making shapes out of clouds? I don't think so. The polling evidence for every statement I have made is strong. How could about 70% of the US people who listened to his speech saying they liked it not be a real signal? And albeit a weaker signal, how could a bounce of about 6 or so % in terms of people actually liking Biden not be a real signal? So My prediction has now played out with respect to Biden: there was indeed a limited Biden bounce after the DNC. But naturally, a partially completed prediction leaves the other half still remaining stochastic. But I have faith in my original view that volatility is historically low, making Trump's chance at a comeback a number of sigma's away. To prove true for sure, Biden's lack of clear bounce based on polling numbers alone must be matched by a small if any bounce for Trump after the RNC. We can only know that in a few days time. But for now, I hold my original prediction that there will be no significant bounce.  However, swing states have narrowed a bit. I entered into a discussion with a previous poster about the \"poll narrowing effect\", which seemed to me to be random noise. Is this the poll narrowing effect meaning that very conflicted undecides are breaking out evenly, or a genuine signal of change of views? Further, even if Trump can change the polls a bit, the RNC is his best chance of doing so. The only other big political game changers ahead are the debates, but with the huge influx of postal voting, where votes will begin to be cast in merely a few weeks, there may not be time for this to make a big influence.  I do note, however, some swing states have narrowed. Is this just statistical noise? We need more data. The best assumption for sudden polling showing something of interest is to assume it is just noise. So lets wait for more polls on this.  Biden is now within the same poll difference of Hillary Clinton. But the polls have recalibrated their turnout models, so much of what happened to Clinton is already factored in the current polls. But again the volatility of the polls is and has always been from the date of my first prediction the real indicator of significant difference rather than the mere size of the lead and that hasn't changed.  So we now move to Covid killing people. As I said in the first post I made, winter is coming. An no, I'm not talking about dragons and white walkers, but I might as well be in terms of Trump's election prospects. Trump has failed to keep Covid under control. When winter comes, it will get much worse with a deterministic probability. Even with a competent scientific literate Trump, he can't do anything about it. But the real Trump continues making fake cures and puts the FDS under pressure to approve them but people will continue to die as a result of Covid and a deterministic drift from Trump's base who Trump killed to the democrats will start speeding up via what I call the \"soldiers knocking at the door\" effect. So Winter is still coming and Trump remains scientifically incompetent.  So now I move on to when I listened to Trump's pitch, he presented a coherent story. To me, it was obviously false and rediculous, but to the average American? Does trump really have a message that he can sell to people? If so, that's a real step forward for him.  This is where I draw my  experience from PMQs in the UK. I have been following this very closely. And the question everybody wants to know is who won. And different people with their own biases have different views on who won. It's probably similar to US debates, except it happens every week. But I looked at it by looking at views of both sides and seeing what seemed to make an impact among the away crowd. And what I have learned from this is that when somebody says something that seems to me to be logically rediculous, it is a fools errand trying to assume many people \"may not have spotted why what was said was so idiotic\" and instead go on gut instinct about what the \"average obviously stupid person who supports my opponent\" might think. This way of deciding who wins a debate essentially infantises those with different views. Instead, what I have found is that those on both sides of the debate are adults, often intelligent too and they do indeed hear a very similar debate to the one I heard in the same way two people supporting opposing football teams still see the same game.  So the best way to judge who is winning the debate is to just listen as impartially as you can to what you personally hear and stop trying to second-guess what you think other people might have heard or be thinking because those people most likely heard the same as you.  And what I heard about Trump claiming it is the democrats politicising drug treatments rather than him is obviously stupid, and provably stupid by the large numbers (including the highly regarded Faucci) speaking out against Republican politicisiation of Covid treatments. And worse, those who might believe him now, will not be believing him in November when winter comes and Covid causes even more havoc. So the only people who might buy this factually rediculous sales pitch are those who already want to vote for him. I don't doubt for a minute the mere existence of a coherent message is a good thing, but essentially it comes down to the fact that a coherent message is not enough to overcome the \"soldiers knocking on the door\" effect.  The caviats to this is that I only listened to Trump's speech for a few minutes and heard only the highlights, and my knowledge of science might distort my view of the discussion relative to average people making it harder than normal for me to see it \"impartially\". But I still find it hard to see how any sensible person can swallow the core message \"the Democrats are so negative because they are politicising good trusted scientific cures, I know a good doctor that approved them\" while many very respected US scientists are speaking out strongly against those very same cures. And then we see the Democrats message of \"my father trusted Trump and believed Trump and now he's dead.\" Is my additional scientific knowledge really so blinding me to the political reality that I have a unique interpretation of such an exchange? But a coherent message still creates a reality that could potentially appeal to some people right now if they have not been severely impacted by Covid.  So we now move to Harris' good Twitter responses to Trump's speech. Kamala Harris is now fully behind team Biden. I knew she was a prosecutor. And I knew what prosecutors should be able to do. But on the other hand, the American system is a little strange in that becoming a state prosecutor is not earned by merit alone but is instead a position voted for by the public leaving an opening for politics to trump competence. And Biden does indeed have a vulnerability to outrageous lies, but given Kamala's experience, she really should make up the difference. Can she expose in a clear, obvious way that everybody can see the clear rediculousness of Trump's lies? And the answer seems to be yes. Her current Twitter responses include statements like : \"the tragedy in all of this is it didn't have to be this bad. Look around. It's not like this and the rest of the world... all we needed was a competent president.\" A single line, clear, damning and full of truth, attacking Trump where he is weakest. \"all we needed was a competent president\" being particularly good.  But Kamala seems to be in charge of responding to Trump's RNC speeches. I looked at only a few Twitter comments, and they are all equally clear, obvious, truthful and damning. Other examples include \"The Republican convention is designed for one purpose -- to soothe Donald Trump's ego. To make him feel good.\"; \"\"We must always defend peaceful protest & peaceful protesters. We should not confuse them w/those looting & committing acts of violence, including the shooter who was arrested for murder... We will not let these vigilantes and extremists derail the path to justice\"; \"Here's what you have to understand about the nature of a pandemic. It's relentless. You can't stop it with a tweet. You can't create a distraction and hope it will go away.\" What all of these statements have in common is a clear simple sentence short enough for a twitter feed that gets to the heart of Trump's narrative of lies and dismantles it at its root. This is a skill Biden's campaign did not have when I made my original prediction. So Trump has demonstrated the ability to conduct a convincing, coherent but false narrative. But Biden via Kamala has now demonstrated the ability to dismantle in plain sight that narrative.  This really matters because at the end of the day, what is an election anyway if not a competition of verbal jousting fighting ruthlessly over persuadable minds?  So finally, I move to my original point about Trump's incompetence. As I predicted a few post below, a savage Hurricain has indeed hit the US. But I predicted Trump would not gain anything from it because his core incompetence means such events make him if anything fall not rise in the polls. Anything that tests his competence makes him look worse not better. Sure, Clinton might be able to use this disaster to get a boost in the polls. But Trump doesn't know the public or private skills needed to do that. It's like giving a child a bow and arrow and asking him to at least hit the target 3 times in a row. Of course he can't.  This political situation now remains to be played out, but we should not forget the core strategic starting point of this. Trump does not know the first thing about hurricains or what to do in them or how to presidentially deal with them, and even if he knew, his personality prevents him from acting as such. Happy to be proved wrong. Indeed if I am, many lives will be saved, which is a good thing. But I doubt it. Instead, this will just serve as another opportunity to demonstrate how incompetent and self-centered Trump really is to the detriment of American lives. To summarise. We don't know yet what Trump's bounce would be, but everything is going as predicted. But Trump's surprising ability to create at least for a snapshot a convincing narrative during the DNC is matched by the skills Kamala has in dismantling that narrative in plain sight. And Trump's opportunity to demonstrate himself to be worthy of President via his reaction to the hurricain is matched equally by the fact that he is clearly not competent or worthy of such a position and he will therefore more likely squander this opportunity rather than exploit it.  So the only element that warrents a change is Trump moving a bit closer in a single set of polling data on swing state. This moves him half a sigma closer to victory, but I think he was 3.5  sigmas away and now he is 3. This difference does not reach a %age unit. Further, many commentators say this change is a result of the recent violent race riots. But they will be over in a few weeks when voting begins. Covid, however, will not.

Indeed, in my post made on Jul 31, 2020 01:25AM, I gave 10 different reasons why Trump couldn't win, and reason's 1-5 were all based on polls.  Should I rebalance now that somebody who knows polling better than I do thinks my 98% is wildly high? No. The prediction stays as is at 98%. The reason is due to my other 5 reasons: the economy, Covid 19, Trump's personal competence, Trump's base only strategy and the absence of plausible scenarios that can lead to a Trump victory.  Nate says correctly \"Models should reflect the real world, and COVID-19 is a big part of the real world in 2020. Given the choice between mild ad-hockery and ignoring COVID-19 entirely, I think mild ad-hockery is better.\" Nate then goes on to factor Covid 19 into his model.  But Nate does this simply by introducing new sources of risk into his model thereby increasing the volatility of the result. This knocks against my point 1, where I highlight the almost unprecedented low volatility in the polls makes Trump's chances of coming back much much harder than normal. But doing this is completely unrealistic relative to the actual impact of Covid 19 and gives Trump a huge boost. To see why this is unrealistic, I apply my \"slap on the head with a wet fish\" test. Nate's discussion of the details of his Covid 19 modelling approach is interesting. But his final conclusion at the end of it is that Covid 19 is helping Trump's chances of victory. REALLY???? Slap on the head with a wet fish. Of course that's nonsense. Nothing is hurting Trump's chances of reelection more than Covid 19.  Instead, Covid 19 is not a risk source of pure volatility but more a source of a deterministic drain on Trump's support. To see why, we should not model Covid 19 just as news volatility as per Nate but go to the actual scientific epidemiological models, which show the chances of the virus receding in any significant positive way between now and November are slight. And we need to look at why Covid 19 impacts voters so much. Voters are not some atomic unit of probability measure as implied by Nate's modelling approach. They are real people. And people are moving away from Trump due to Covid 19 because voters have been dying or losing loved ones because of it. So it's not something that will just go \"up and down\" like a game of roulette. The only way that would happen is if people dead from Covid 19 can come back to life again if Trump gets a \"lucky roll\" of his \"Covid dice\". Those who were strong Trump voters who lost loved ones before their time will no longer be reachable to Trump, and Trump suddenly discovering a faint interest in science to do something useful for Covid 19 isn't going to change that unless Trump can bring people back to life.  Even those who haven't lost loved ones may have lost a year of their lives. Trump can't give that back either. So to model Covid 19 like it's ordinary news I think was a big departure from reality made by Nate, who is a polling expert but not an epidemiology expert.  Then, we move to Nate's treatment of the economy. Nate simply again introduces more volatility to account for this. He justifies this by looking at the economic models and observes no doubt correctly \"forecasts based on economic \u201cfundamentals\u201d \u2014 which have never been as accurate as claimed \u2014 are a mess this year.\"  Well yes, of course they are. Covid 19 is not a normal recession. It's a recession based on a very close connection with a virus, so of course standard economic models used in normal times will not do well. The only possible models that can give a sensible economic prediction in these times must have epidemiological models either as an input or embedded within them. Otherwise, the single-most important risk factor driving the economic uncertainty is simply not being included in the model, so you end up with rubbish in rubbish out.  And as per my point 6, the fate of the US economy in November is heavily correlated by the fate of Covid 19 and so is almost certain to be very bad for Trump. Nate has ignored this correlation. My suggestion for Nate is as follows. He correctly says \"every time you correct for something so your model fits the past data better, you raise the possibility that you\u2019re overfitting the data and that your model won\u2019t be as accurate as claimed when applied to situations where you don\u2019t already know the outcome.\" However, he needs to find a better way of incorporating some risk factors into his model that isn't simply about introducing a new source of outright volatility. Instead, I think he needs to at least take into account skewness of the new risk factor (i.e. factor in that some sources of risk can only ever harm one candidate) and better yet when an issue impacting an election has available a rich source of scientific modelling (i.e. epidemiological modelling), that modelling should also be included somehow in his polling model.  Finally, Nate has made the classic false assumption that past performance represents future performance. In particular, he has noted in normal presidential races, the other candidate has been able to change their final voting numbers often to a large degree. But in automatically assuming Trump can do the same, he ignores my point 8, that Trump is incompetent to a level unseen by any previous president. So while skilled candidates might be able to turn it around from here if a lucky event happens, Trumps cannot and instead will almost certainly bungle the opportunity. Further, Trump's strategy is base only, while all previous presidential campaigns have been aimed at undecideds and swing voters. This means voters in this election are far more sticky than they were before making it far harder for Trump to make up the loss of any voters on Trump's side with fresh new voters changing sides. In other words, it's much more important for Trump to hold onto the voters he already has than in any election in living memory. So the past purely statistical election trends will unlikely give Trump a life time in this 2020 election. Nate does in fairness take this into account by modelling polarisation. But I don't think this goes far enough because polarisation alone does not capture the impact of a \"base only\" electorial strategy.  So I will keep my prediction at 98% because Covid 19 and the resulting economic recession has not been well captured by Nate's model, nor has Nate captured Trump's fundamental incompetence and his \"base only\" electoral strategy."], [67403, "2020-08-17T19:40:38Z", [0.33], ""], [94632, "2020-08-17T18:33:11Z", [0.95], ""], [95068, "2020-08-17T18:08:16Z", [0.88], "Yes, but...the real number would be something like 91% IF the electoral vote goes to the popular vote winner.

I estimated 2.5% chance of biden dying and 2% chance of trump dying and assumed \"conservatively\" it could go either way if either dies.  I then added a 1% chance I'm spectacularly wrong. Final probability is then (1-[2.5%+2%]\u00d70.5-1%) rounded down = 96%. I think forecasts should not only be updated by new evidence but also by double checking ones assumptions with the same evidence to produce an enhanced prediction.  In this case,  if biden or trump dies, can I do no better than 50-50?  If Trump dies,  the Republicans will then face a big big problem.  They have a binary choice: choose a trump loyalist or choose a trump critic (in any event it will likely be Pence). If they choose a critic, Trump's base will be outraged and consider it an establishment stitch up.  Many of them will be so outraged they won't vote.  Meanwhile,  nearly all senior Republican's were staunch Trump enablers (eg all but one republican senators voted to acquit trump in impeachment without even looking at the evidence)  to the point they will not be able to distance themselves from Trump's legacy enough to win back any sizeable numbers of voters and with just a few months to go until the election,  there is not much time for enormous swings.  So even Trump's death will likely be too little too late.  I would say chance of republican victory upon Trump's death is about 10% but it shrinks to 5% given his successor will probably be pence and pence is also incompetent. Similarly with Biden's death,  we should remember nothing in my analysis mentioned anything particular about Biden except he was a moderate who unlike Clinton people do not hate much.  The large determination of his voters to vote for him is mostly motivated by getting rid of Trump. But any moderate who is not hated will do.  It's very unlikely the Dems will anoint someone like Sanders and most likely Biden`s new VP candidate Ms Harris will be the only person with the political legitimacy or even legal right to stand as president. And while Ms Harris is a women and is black and no doubt will be truly hated by many in Trump's base,  she will be truly loved by many of the Dems base for the same reason.  But more to the point,  there is no evidence Clinton was hated solely for being a women so most swing voters will unlikely care.  And Ms Harris is formidably competent and exactly the right person to hurt trump badly in the debates.  At the mo,  she can only \"do her thing\" against Pence for far less political gain. But against Trump?  Remember how strongly Trump's legal team insisted trump does not testify at congress under any circumstances? Apparently even light questioning made trump look awful. Well Ms Harris is a formidable prosecutor and will get many chances in one on one debates.  This alone will make up for any difference between misogynistic racists who might vote for a white male but not a black women vs new black voters.  So I think the probability of Trump winning if Biden dies i think is closer to 5% than 50%.  So if either candidate dies, not much will change.  The Republicans are too committed to Trumpism to be able to make any changes in strategy at this late stage if Trump dies. And trump will fair no better against all likely Dem leaders if Biden dies.  So we have 2.5% \u00d7 5% + 2% \u00d7 10% = 0.125% + 0.2% = approx 0.35% plus 1% chance I'm spectacularly wrong,  so 1.35% in all.

So the actual chance is what is the probability biden will win the election.  Let's first remember trump only beat Clinton by a few tens of thousands in key swing states.  So biden just needs to do better than that.  But he almost certainly will.   1) polling evidence for biden winning is vastly stronger than for clinton at a similar period.  The size of the lead is a bit more than Clinton's.  That alone is potentially enough. But the real difference is the lack of volatility in the polls. Most people have made up their minds. 2) Trump is behind in numerous states that should be republican that if he loses its decisive.  Not only does this create even more paths for victory for biden but for trump to defend against this threat,  he will have to pour resources into these battles diverting resources from more traditional swing states.   3) Trump is no longer the incumbent.  Many of those who voted for trump voted more against the establishment represented by Clinton than for trump.  But with trump now president this effect is a lot weaker.  And polls show such voters now overwhelmingly supporting biden. 4) Clinton failed to get black voters to rally round her.  But after George Floyd and efforts by Republicans to disenfranchise black voters,  the black community will be more motivated to vote than almost any time since the troubles of Martin Luther King. Similarly,  all polls show when considering how determined people are to vote against the other candidate,  Biden's \"enthusiasm problem\" is a myth created by asking the wrong question and the truth of relative motivation is biden voters are more likely to be motivated because his voters dislike trump far more than Trump's voters dislike biden. In an election that's in effect a referendum on trump, does positive support for biden really matter that much relative to active loathing of trump?  5) The polls are not wrong this time and if they are it will likely favor biden because the polls rebased their turn out models based on the turn out in the last election,  and the chances that a similar delta in turnout demographics happening a second time are virtually zero.  6) Many people support trump for the economy. However there are 2 types of such supporters. The first realizes a monkey could ensure a strong economy during good times and instead competence is the difference between good and less good economic success.  Those people will see trumps clear incompetence for Covid 19 and will significantly weaken their support.  The second type fails to realize that and will assume trump is responsible for a boom and for a bust and right now there is a severe bust.  So will there be a recovery by November? No chance.  Trumps handling of covid 19 is abysmal.  Even if Tump now does everything perfectly and undergoes total lockdown, it will take at least 6 weeks to bring the virus under control.  They brings us to mid  September or so.  That's when autumn / winter begin and schools restart and R will shoot up again. And trump is completely incapable of dealing with the virus in any sensible way. He is still debating whether even testing is a good idea and refunding testing,  so the idea he will have a fully effective track and trace system in place sufficient to end the recession in place by November is a fantasy. Nor is there any chance a vaccine can ride to the rescue because they will only be available by Chrismas at the earliest and that ignores the time taken to actually inoculate the entire nation and the anti vaccine lobby.  This election is taking place in a recession.  7) Covid 19 is turning Trumps base against him particularly for older voters who are almost certain to vote.  Trump can say lots of rhetoric.  It might even be soothing rhetoric in another era. But while old people are dying of the virus all over the country, rhetoric saying otherwise is making them very angry. Further, the elderly will not vote for someone that will likely kill them, especially while they are being killed. And the areas that are impacted most by Covid 19 incompetence are almost all republican strongholds,  even the areas in California currently being infected.  For these people,  it's not a debate any more, it's real and they do not support trump more than they support their own life.  Polling evidence is showing Trump's base disintegrating for exactly this reason in exactly the areas the virus is hurting most. This is fatal for Trump's base only electoral strategy.  8) unknown unknowns.  Trump is in a real hole.  For him to come back from here is not impossible.  He needs to be lucky,  and a week is a long time in politics yackety yack. But luck is not enough.  Trump also needs to ruthlessly exploit these opportunities with incredible political skill and maybe just maybe he could come back.  But trump has no such skill.  Worse,  he is fundamentally incapable of developing such skill or even sitting back and letting someone with such skill take control. We saw that with the recent attempt at pretending to be grown up during his recent return to Covid 19 press conferences. Trump based no doubt on advice finally publicly supported masks for the first time. But that grown up trump lasted just two days before he slipped back into his old self endorsing his ridiculous drug with no evidence of effectiveness whatsoever and then defended giving a platform to someone who he didn't know who believes alien DNA is in some medicines and then started storming off again after light questioning.  If unknown unknowns occur,  trump therfore lacks the skill to exploit them.  If anything,  it will be biden that exploits them and all that will happen by the unknown unknown is trump will once again demonstrate how incompetent he really is. It is really really important not to underestimate how big an impact Trump's personality and intellectual inadequacy has on Trumps ability to turn this around.  9) There are no remotely plausible Trump victory scenarios. They all fail due to at least one of the above 8 points. 10) the only realistic scenario in which biden could lose is can see is if he dies or if trump dies or suffers from a serious health issue. Biden is in his late 70s, trump in his early 70s. This is probably the main weakness in my %.  I can't be bothered to do in depth statistical analysis on the probability of both living to the presidential election conditioned on them being healthy today and having the best possible medical care money can buy. Instead I do a broad brush estimate. I guesstimate about at 75% chance somebody in mid 70s will not live another 10 years.  I then crudely estimate probability to be linear,  so 7.5% chance of living 1 year and 2.5% chance of dying in 1/3 of a year.  Trump being younger has a higher chance of survival so, say 2% chance.  Failing that,  the chance of a trump victory is basically just the chance of me being spectacularly wrong,  which I say is 1%. Round down for conservatism to 94%. Obviously with such a low probability of trump winning the electoral college,  his chance of winning the popular vote is zero,  and even if it isn't,  it is strongly correlated with the 1% chance of me being spectacularly wrong so adds no extra probability weight. Edit: okay,  if biden dies, the dems will get another challenger,  and the chance of the dems winning then is not zero.  In fact it's still high,  I'll guesstimate conservatively at about 50%. So 5% chance of dems not winning popular and electoral college vote becomes 2.5%, plus 1% chance of me being spectacularly wrong takes to to 96%.

Given the structural differences between rural vs. urban states (population density vs number of electoral college seats), historically the electoral college has disproportionately favoured rural states with lower populations than urban states. Given the current political-demographic trends, this can be broadly extrapolated to say that Republicans running tend to have an advantage in the Electoral College over Democrats. This is borne out by the fact that in modern history the only two times a president has won the Electoral College but not the popular vote, it has been a Republican. Republican Party:\nElections won = 8\t   \nPopular vote won = 6 Democrat Party:\nElections won = 6\t   \nPopular vote won = 8 So based on historical trends, statistically if a Democrat wins the popular vote there is only a 75% chance they will win the electoral college. If a Republican wins the electoral college there is only a 75% chance they will have won the popular vote. Assuming therefore that the race will be between Joe Biden (D) and Donald Trump (R), if Joe Biden wins the Electoral College there will be a 100% chance of him having also won the popular vote; if Donald Trump wins, there will only be a 75% chance of him having done so.  Taking these probabilities, we can apply them to current polling figures for each candidate, calculating an overall likelihood for a candidate winning both the popular vote and the Electoral College, weighted against their relative likelihood of winning the election. I have chosen to use Nate Silver\u2019s poll-of-polls (https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/national/) which currently has Biden polling 50.7% vs Trump on 41.6%. Removing undecideds from that gives us a current poll of Biden on 54.9% vs Trump on 45.1%. Based on historical trends, polling of this nature at this point prior to the election would place Biden\u2019s chances at 65% to Trump\u2019s 35%. Applying the weighting discussed earlier and summing the two ((0.65 x 1) + (0.35 x 0.75)) gives us an overall probability of 91.25% of the winner of the popular vote also winning the Electoral College.

The winner of the Electoral College has won the popular vote in 53 out of the 58 US Presidential elections ever held - 91.3 percent. [1] Of course, last time around, this did not happen. It is one of the only four elections when this did not occur. The real insight here comes if we look a little further. Of the the elections held immediately following (1880, 1892, 2004) for which we have results, the incumbent president or his party went on to win twice (66%).[2]. How does this compare to overall incumbent advantage? Nineteen presidents have sought re-election since 1900 and only 5 (Bush Sr, Carter, Ford, Hoover and Taft) have lost. This gives the incumbent a a 73 percent chance of winning on average, slightly more than the previous statistic. [3] These are extraordinary times however and only one of the five Presidents to run for re-election during a recession has won (20%).[4] Obviously, the question is not \"Will Trump get re-elected?\" but it is still a statstic worthy of note in trying to calculate a base rate. Looking for our base rate then, we can say with a reasonable degree of certainty that the likliehood of the winner taking both the popular vote in between 66 and 91 percent. If we examine the split elections as we might call them, there is an average of exactly 14 years between each (1876-1888, 2000-2016) and 112 years between each group. Thus, I think we can safely rely on that 91.3 rate and push it up even further to 94 or 95 percent. I think the reason the crowd rate is is so low is recency bias and that's understandable but looking at the longer term picture puts things into proper perspective in my view. Please feel free to critique my reasoning below or offer different ways of getting to a solution.

WINNING THE POPULAR VOTE\nOne way to look at winning the popular vote is assess the voting population and their likely voting preferences. Gallup currently has a percentage split between Republican (R), Democrat (D), and Independent (I) of 30/30/36 respectively (https://news.gallup.com/poll/15370/party-affiliation.aspx) with independents leaning R or D 42 and 44 respectively. If we assume for the sake of simplicity that these answers are all accurate and unlikely to change substantially between now and election day, that puts the D vote at a slight lead of 35.83% vs R at 35.12% and leaves a \"true\" independent figure of 5.04%. Again for simplicity, our base likelihood will be D-win 0.505 R-win 0.495. Clearly there a re a number of factors that can influence these numbers:\n- changes in perception of candidate/policy/action;\n- voter agency; and\n- misc/black swan modifications (death of a candidate, civil unrest, covid19 death rates disproportionately affecting one voter base etc.). Changes in policy perception are, I believe, likely to favour the D-win scenario slightly, as the R incumbent's reaction to the COVID-19 epidemic are viewed negatively in the majority of polls (https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/public_approval_of_president_trumps_handling_of_the_coronavirus-7088.html). The impact of this is likely to lessen the further away from peak death toll the election is. This may be further reduced by disapproval/approval aligning with previous political preferences. Accordingly, I will assign this a sway of 0.004 to D-win (arbitrary; 1% of R voters rounded up). Thus D-win 0.509 R-win 0.491. Voter agency has become a public issue with concerns over the continuation of the postal service and the mis-handling of Democratic primary voting  in light of COVID-19 transmission concerns. Nonvoters in general lean Democratic (https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/increased-voter-turnout-could-benefit-republicans-or-democrats-in-2020/) so a rough assumption would be that increase in voter turnout would result in a boost to D-win likelihood. Voter turnout is typically decreased by increased 'costs' of voting such as timeframe in which to vote and ease of registration (https://onlinepoliticalsciencedegree.eku.edu/insidelook/what-causes-low-voter-turnout-united-states). One might expect COVID-19 to have a huge impact on this, with high impacts discernable near election time likely to result in mail-in voting for more of the population, and thus increased voter agency. This may also be strengthened if America enters a \"second wave\" of COVID-19 fatalities/hospitalisations caused by the premature relaxation of social distancing requirements. Based on the above fivethirtyeight link, nonvoters represent 43% of the voting population, with 33% of nonvoters saying they would vote D and 30% saying they would vote R. Let's reduce the total number of nonvoters that we assume will actually vote to 5% of the voting population (on the assumption that political motivations and dramatic world events will make this a high-engagement election). This adds 0.017 to D-win and 0.015 to R-win. Net 0.002 to D-win. Thus D-win 0.511 R-win 0.489.  We will ignore high impact, low likelihood events for brevity's sake. End result 51.1% chance of D-win of the popular vote. WINNING THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE\nI will split this into two factors:\n1) historical precedence; and\n2) modifications to the effect of the popular vote. There have been 5 elections out of the 49 in which the popular vote has been counted where the winner has lost the popular vote (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_elections_in_which_the_winner_lost_the_popular_vote). This is roughly 10.2% of those elections or a 0.102 chance without modifications. I would argue we should discount 1824 as there were more than 2 candidates and thus it is unlikely 2020 will repeat the experience of no candidate gaining the threshold number of Elector College (EC) votes. Similarly, I would argue that we can discount 2016 due to both parties experiencing turmoil in candidate selection, arguably resulting in usual voter and elector disenfranchisement (I have no quantitative argument for this, all I will say is that I find the unprecedented number of faithless electors to be emblematic of this). This would take us down to 3/49, or a 0.061 chance of the popular vote winner losing the electoral college. The voting population is not evenly distributed, so while an increase in voter turnout may favour D-win in the popular vote, it is arguable that it will contribute to R-win in key states such as PA and FL (https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/increased-voter-turnout-could-benefit-republicans-or-democrats-in-2020/). I'm not smart enough to get granular on the maths here (as is no doubt apparent if you've read this far), so I will simply add this as 0.003 towards R-win of the EC vote. OUTCOMES\nThis leaves us with the following options: 1) D-win(pop) + D-win(EC); 2) D-win(pop) + R-win(EC); 3) R-win(pop) + D-win(EC); and 4) R-win(pop) + R-win(EC). (Calculations rounded to 3 decimal places) 1) D-win(pop) + D-win(EC) = 0.511 * ( 0.939 - 0.003 ) = 0.478 2) D-win(pop) + R-win(EC) = 0.511 * ( 0.061 + 0.003 ) = 0.033 3) R-win(pop) + D-win(EC) = 0.489 * ( 0.061 - 0.003 ) = 0.028 4) R-win(pop) + R-win(EC) = 0.489 * ( 0.939 + 0.003 ) = 0.461 Options 1 and 4 both meet the criteria for the question, totalling 0.939. Thus I would predict (based on a very limited number of factors and a HUGE number of assumptions) a 93.9% likelihood of the winner of the popular vote in the 2020 United States presidential election also winning the electoral college."], [87732, "2020-04-19T22:32:31Z", [0.8], "Likely to be a large Trump victory"], [87730, "2020-04-19T21:32:02Z", [0.55], "Given Trump's low approval rating and declining economic outlook, I would rate his chances of improving on his 2016 performance where he did not win the popular vote as remote.

Furthermore, a Republican victory may be achieved if Trump places much more attention on the swing states, just like in 2016.

Firstly, the turnout wave has not materialized: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/historic-turnout-in-2020-not-so-far/ and https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/2020-democratic-primary-turnout-problems-960784/ have covered this. Without a historic turnout, the race will be close enough for Trump to win the presidency without having to win the popular vote. Secondly, with COVID-19, turnout may be further dampened. I presume the elections will not be postponed. I am agnostic about the effects of the crisis: so far, Republicans and Democrats are polarized about COVID-19, as per data from https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/flu-comes-back-every-year-will-coronavirus/. Approval ratings are just noise: American politics is polarized, Republicans will vote for Trump, Democrats for Biden -whom I assume will be the nominee. Democrats form the majority in America so a Republican president in this polarized era of the last few decades is always going to have bad approval ratings. What matters is not who is most popular but whose voters turnout.  I may revise downwards more drastically in future based on turnout in the primaries and data on likely voters in the elections when it becomes available.  Last year, @Anneinak pointed out that according to The Keys to the White House idea (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Keys_to_the_White_House), Trump was the more likely to win in 2020. I think the short and long-term economy will be against Trump -but again, perceptions of his performance are polarized and I have seen data indicating that Republicans see the current economic trajectory as REASON TO SUPPORT TRUMP, but according to the Keys, I think he loses that metric. In terms of foreign policy or military successes, there have been none to speak of. I have mentioned on occasion that the performance of the left in national politics in the West has been abysmal over the last few decades. When the left wins, it is usually when it has a charismatic leader like Bill Clinton, Tony Blair or Barack Obama. Andrew Rawnsley at the Guardian wrote an article that makes a similar argument: https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/23/tony-blair-and-the-lefts-perverse-preference-for-failure-over-success. The left is not very good at winning elections. All that leads me to think that according to the Keys, Trump is likely to win and the turnout data suggests the Democrats may be struggling to get their voters to turnout. Why am I still at 90%? I am waiting for data on voter perceptions of Trump after a month or two of COVID-19. I am tempted to think his base may get a little antsy and COVID-19 and the looming recession may be enough to sink Trump.

Biden will win the Democratic Nomination and the Presidential election. First, in 2016, Donald J. Trump won the electoral college by carrying states that traditionally voted for Republicans while flipping Florida, Ohio, Pennslyvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. A feat pulled off most recently by one other Republican: Ronald Reagan[1]. However, Donald J Trump lost the popular vote by appx 2.86 Million votes [2]. In order for Donald J Trump to win both the electoral college and the popular vote in 2020, he must expand his influence with likely voters while holding all 5 swing states that he won in 2016. Further, Donald J Trump does not actually need to win the popular vote to win the states needed for an electoral college victory [3]. However, in order for Joseph R Biden to in the 2020 Presidential election, his campaign must hold all of the states that voted Democratic in 2016 AND reclaim at least 2-3 of the 5 swing states Donald J Trump won, or flip solid republican voting states (ex. North Carolina, Arizona, Texas, Etc.). Further, the Democrats need to mobilize voters that were part of the Obama coalition in 2008 to vote for Joseph R Biden and, most likely, cannot win the Electoral College without winning the Popular vote. So that leaves us with 5 outcomes for each candidate: 1- WPV/WEC\n2- WPV/LEC\n3- LPV/WEC\n4- LPV/LEC\n5- Tie (which would result in neither candidate winning the electoral college) The most likely scenarios for Donald J Trump are options 3 or 4. The most likely scenarios for Joseph R Biden are options 1 or 2. Looking at the most recent NBC poll, Joseph R. Biden has a lead of +4 over Donald J Trump [4]. Further, Joseph R. Biden has an average lead over Donald J Trump of +6.3 at a national level [5]. As we learned from the 2016 election, national polls did not accurately predict the outcome of the electoral college but came close to predicting the popular vote results [6]. Thus, it is imperative to look at the state polls for each of the 5 swing states. Of the 5 swing states that have had polls conducted, Donald J Trump currently only leads in Florida (by an average of +0.5) and is tied in Wisconsin. Joseph R. Biden leads in Michigan and Pennsylvania. Further, Joseph R. Biden is also currently leading in Arizona and North Carolina [7]. I do acknowledge that all of these polls are being released very early in the process and must be updated as the election gets closer. One final factor to look at in regards to Donald J Trump winning both the popular vote and electoral college is his approval rating by state. In Jan 2017, 45 states reported a positive net approval of Donald J Trump. As of Feb 2020, 25 states reported a positive net approval of Donald J. Trump [8]. After reviewing this data, I assess there is currently a 98% chance that Joseph R. Biden will win both the electoral college and the Popular vote. I also assess there is a 2% chance that Donald J. Trump will win both the electoral college and win the popular vote. Based on current polling data and approval ratings, I assess that Joseph R. Biden will defeat Donald J. Trump in the 2020 Presidential election. Thus, I assess that there is currently a 98% chance of Joseph R Biden winning both the electoral college and popular vote and a 2% chance that neither happens.  I will update this prediction as new information becomes available and the general election gets closer. Please correct/point-out any errors in my analysis or mistakes I have made.

The article discusses a theory of elections I agree with: there are no swing voters, the game is all about turnout. Each election is won by the coalition that turns up. In 2016, too many Democrats stayed home or voted for third candidates or were lured by Trump. In 2020, there is a palpable wave building and I feel the Democratic coalition will turn up. Biden has weaknesses, but I think the difference with 2016 is that Democrats who stayed home did not envision a Hillary Clinton loss or imagined that they were comfortable with either a Trump or Clinton win and many created a false equivalence that in retrospect they would not have.

Hayes, a Republican, won), 1888 (Benjamin Harrison, a Republican, won), 2000 (George W. Bush, a Republican, won), and 2016 (Donald Trump, a Republican, won). Given that there have been 58 presidential elections, we have then a 91.38% chance of a candidate winning the popular vote and also the electoral college. (In 1824, no candidate won the Electoral College and the presidential election a required contingent election in the House of Representatives under the provisions of the 12th Amendment.)  The electoral map is titled in favour of Republicans. By design, the electoral college attempts to give underpopulated states a greater in electing the president, by assigning two Electoral College votes for each state's senator, so that they are not alienated from the American project. Secondly, the winner-takes-all system that most states use to allocate Electoral College delegate means running up the score in California while losing Wyoming, is a waste of votes. Why does this disproportionately affect Democrats? The Democratic coalition is not optimized to win presidential elections, being too concentrated in fewer states than those of the Republicans. This article gives a good run-through of that from a Republican point of view: https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/05/electoral-college-favors-republicans-democrats-geographically-concentrated/.  The side-effect of this is that in closely contested elections, the probability of the candidate who won the popular vote losing the electoral college, jumps up. Research shows that America has become increasingly polarized over the last few decades (https://www.people-press.org/2014/06/12/section-1-growing-ideological-consistency/#interactive) -demonstrated in that prior to Bush' 2000 win, the last time a candidate had lost the popular vote and won the electoral college was in the 19th century- and increased polarization means an increased likelihood of close elections. In a paper entitled \"Inversions in US Presidential Elections: 1836-2016\", Michael Geruso, Dean Spears, and Ishaana Talesara demonstrate that in the last 30 years, a hypothetical Republican who won 49% of the two-party popular vote (excluding a third party), had an expected win rate in the Electoral College of around 27%. A Democrat with the same share of vote would have just an 11% expected win rate. Nudge that up to 49.5 percent of the popular vote, and a Republican would have an expected win rate of 46%, against a 21% expected win rate for a Democrat. If the popular vote was split evenly, a Republican would have an expected win rate of 65 percent chance. So we have to ask ourselves: will 2020 be a close election? Conventional wisdom says Republicans win by suppressing turnout in Democratic constituencies while Democrats win through turnout, ceteris paribus -though studies suggest this may not be strictly the case, that is, high turnout could favour either party (https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/increased-voter-turnout-could-benefit-republicans-or-democrats-in-2020/). Democrats in 2020 are driven to recreate the Obama coalition and win through turnout. I am minded to think at this stage that the 2020 election will not be close in terms of popular vote and therefore, the high base rate of 91% will hold. I will revise downwards based on projections of voter-turnout. Voter turnout is essentially why Democrats have lost elections in which they have won the popular vote: their margin of victory has not been big enough. They need a blow-out result, well, a not-close result. Republicans have a very small chance of winning the popular vote -demographically, Republicans are in retreat-, so it's down to Democrats to win big. Of course, my assumption is that Biden wins the Democratic nomination and high voter turn out helps him more than Trump.  I think there is enough evidence to show that 2020 will be a high voter turnout election: https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2019/11/20/what-does-high-voter-turnout-tell-us-about-the-2020-elections/, https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/06/2020-election-voter-turnout-could-be-record-breaking/591607/, https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/15/upshot/2020-election-turnout-analysis.html. ."], [15363, "2020-03-05T11:03:17Z", [0.45], ""], [14853, "2020-03-05T08:40:35Z", [0.65], ""], [41612, "2020-03-05T08:16:00Z", [0.49], ""], [484, "2020-03-05T06:08:14Z", [0.75], "Up 25%.

Instead, it's based on educated guesses about two pairs of probabilities we can use to compute this one: the probability of each party winning the election, and the probability of each party winning the popular vote. I see the election outcome as a toss-up at this point. We know the parties are fairly evenly matched at the national level; we know that fundamentals probably favor Trump by a smidge, but we also know from the last election that traditional election-forecasting models may not be as reliable as they used to be; we don't know who the Democratic candidate will be; and we know that the election is still nine months away, and a lot can happen in nine months. So, p(win) ~ 0.5 for both major parties. At the same time, I think it's highly likely that the Democratic nominee will win the popular vote. Clinton beat Trump by nearly 3 million votes (over 2%) in 2016, and she was a *demobilizing* candidate. At the national level, voters are concentrated in urban areas that lean strongly Democratic; it's just that the Electoral College sharply down-weights their votes. So I would give a generic Democratic candidate a 90-percent chance of winning the popular vote against Trump again. Now we can do a little math to get from those probabilities to our answer: p(Dem wins) =  0.5\np(Dem wins pop vote) = 0.9\np(D wins | won pop vote) = 0.9 * 0.5 = 0.45\np(Rep wins) = 0.5\np(Rep wins pop vote) = 0.1\np(Rep wins | won pop vote) =0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 So... p(Dem wins | pop vote) + p(Rep wins | won pop vote): 0.45 + 0.05 = 0.5 For now, my plan is to update this forecast using the same logic but adjusting the two key probabilities as we get closer to the election and poll-driven forecasts give us more information about the likelihood of a D or GOP win."], [30477, "2020-02-10T10:56:51Z", [0.44], ""], [80539, "2020-02-10T00:52:22Z", [0.5], ""], [75824, "2020-02-10T00:22:28Z", [0.9], "Base rate: 44 of 49 times (89.7%) the winner of the popular vote also won the electoral college (since 1824 when the popular vote started to be recorded) [1].

Hence, the question boils down to whether a Democratic challenger will win the electoral college. The answer depends largely on a few key swing states and who is nominated.

Since 1824, when the popular vote was first tallied, there have been 49 presidential elections. Of those, 4 clearly resulted in a split between popular vote winner and Electoral College winner, a 5th\u2014the 1824 election\u2014arguably resulted in such a difference, although in that election, no one received sufficient Electoral College votes and the election was decided in the House of Representatives. Possibly a 6th instance occurred if one counts the 1960 election and its Alabama discrepancies. That translates to about 8-12%. In contemporary, post World War II history, there have been 18 elections since 1948. Of those, 2 (and possibly 3, again accounting for the 1960 election) have resulted in a popular/electoral college vote split. That\u2019s 11-17%.  So let\u2019s blend them and call the base 14%. An April 2018 study prepared by the Center for American Progress, along with the Brookings Institution, the Bipartisan Policy Center and PRRI, ran a series of simulations based on various demographic assumptions. https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2018-19-4_metro_billfrey_electoralfuture-report2018.pdf\nOf the 16 scenarios ran, 5 (31.25%) resulted in a popular vote/Electoral College vote split. The authors, however, did not suggest how likely any particular scenario might be and it is clear from the study that the likelihood of each scenario is not equal. That is, some scenarios are more likely than others to occur, but without that info, weighting outcomes is not possible. Moreover, the outcomes may reflect a bias, because in only 1 scenario out of the 16 do Republicans win the popular vote. The remaining 15 have the Democrats winning the popular vote and then either also carrying the Electoral College, or in the 5 referenced instances where the popular vote is close, losing in the Electoral College. On the other hand, as voting demographics have shifted, the Republican base has shrunk, making it more likely for Democrats to win the popular vote, while lagging in the Electoral College, so the scenarios may reflect the modern shift in voting demographics. Indeed, the two most recent examples of a split (2000 and 2016) both resulted in Democrats wining the popular vote, but losing to Republicans in the Electoral College. Moreover, in the post-World War II era, no Republican has won the popular vote, even by a narrow margin, and lost in the Electoral College (with the possible exception of Nixon in 1960). \nLooking at recent polling results for the general election between Trump and the leading Democratic candidates show Trump lagging in the vast majority of the polls to all Democratic candidates. Recent CNN polls from January 22 put all Democrats ahead of Trump by a minimum of +3%. However, other, slightly earlier, polls put the races closer (often within or near the margin of error). Not surprisingly this early on, the best we can say is that the general electorate (i.e., the popular vote) is leaning Democratic and may be increasing in that lean, but not by a huge amount. This implies a closer popular vote, that might therefore increase the probability of a split between the popular vote and the Electoral College, as we saw in the simulations noted above. Notably, out of the 7 simulations where the popular vote was close (within 3%), the simulations resulted in 5 splits (71%) between the popular vote and the Electoral College. \nA review of the two national polls this year on Real Clear Politics  (Jan 13 and Jan 22) show various Dems winning 10 of 11 races against Trump, with 5 of the 10  wins being within 3% (4 of those are from the earlier poll). I won\u2019t weight the probability of any given Dem winning the primary and will just assume and equal chance. So if we assume a 50% probability of a race within 3%, and we use the 71% popular vote/Electoral College split result for close races from the simulation, we would be at 35.5%, interestingly close to the 31% result of the overall CAP review. This range, though, might be high, especially if we assume that once Democrats select a candidate, there will likely be some rallying around that candidate (though it is possible that a more controversial Democratic candidate could send some voters to vote for Trump). I think overall Dems are likely to grow in support of their single candidate, thus widening the win margin. That being said, recent elections have had narrower margins of victory. While Obama won by over 7% in 2008, he won by a narrower 3.86% in 2012 and of course, Trump lost the popular vote. Even after Bush won the popular vote in 2004, he did so by only 2.4%.  These narrow margins might also indicate the inaccuracies inherent in polling, so let\u2019s just offset them for now. That leaves us with a 36% chance of a split, assuming a Democrat wins the popular vote (and I've assumed for now the polls  are accurate) and that that probability is at 91%. So 36% for a close vote * 91% Democrat wins popular vote equals approximately 33% split. I'll assume if Trump wins the popular vote he will also win the Electoral College, which puts the probability of the winner of the popular vote also winning the Electoral College  at 100-33, or 67%.\n"], [84393, "2020-01-22T23:09:14Z", [0.85], "I think Americans are getting fed up with all the lies and deceit of Trump and will vote him out."], [71569, "2020-01-22T21:37:35Z", [0.39], "Blocking of voters by state in the new normal.
