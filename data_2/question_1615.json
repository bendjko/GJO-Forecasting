Susan Collins is best friends with Alaska's most effective senator, Lisa Murkowski. Lisa was \"primaried\".  Thinking her ultra-conservative Republic opponent was not a threat, she didn't campaign much during the primary and lost!  Some Democrats and others convinced her that she was electable if she ran as an independent write-in candidate.  Given that she doesn't have a common last name, would be a write-in, and was running against party candidates, it was a long-shot, but she won.  Now, if something like that happens in Maine, that would mean \"Someone else\" would be the winner.  Right?   I'm wondering how Maine voters rank DJT.  A Democratic senatorial candidate might out-poll the Democratic presidential candidate if folks think that it's important to flip the Senate, regardless, or because of who might win the WH. EDIT:  I'm thinking that we have to keep in mind that COVID is/could be a black swan this election cycle.   What if one of these candidates got a severe case of it and either was unable to campaign or died?
