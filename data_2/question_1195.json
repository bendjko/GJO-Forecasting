The pollsters are very divided [1] with regard to the Brexit Party. The last few polls from each company are; \u2022 YouGov: 28%, 30%, 34%, 35%\n\u2022 ComRes: 17%, 28%, 27%, 27%\n\u2022 Opinium: 12%, 28%, 29%, 34%\n\u2022 Survation: 27%, 30% An average weighted by date and poll size currently puts them on 32.5%. The latest survey by YouGov [2] has Labour on 15% (split 3-1 remain-leave) and the Tories on just 9% (split 1-1 remain-leave) so there simply aren't many more leave voters left to switch to the Brexit Party, however they are only 2.5% from the 35% threshold so they could  just sneak into that top bucket. Indeed if YouGov are correct, the Brexit Party are in the top bucket already and the crowd has got this one wrong. Crowd: 14%, 19%, 28%, 26%, 13% [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_European_Parliament_election_in_the_United_Kingdom#Opinion_polls\n[2] https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/05/17/labour-and-tories-lose-majority-support-brexit-pro"], [73605, "2019-05-17T21:33:18Z", [0.9, 0.05, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [45451, "2019-05-17T21:24:33Z", [0.03, 0.8, 0.1, 0.07, 0.0], ""], [73603, "2019-05-17T21:23:57Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [70364, "2019-05-17T20:21:58Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5], ""], [61055, "2019-05-17T20:13:46Z", [0.2, 0.6, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [68491, "2019-05-17T20:13:08Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [691, "2019-05-17T19:54:31Z", [0.06, 0.21, 0.46, 0.21, 0.06], ""], [71910, "2019-05-17T19:54:28Z", [0.2, 0.25, 0.25, 0.2, 0.1], ""], [54817, "2019-05-17T19:52:07Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.24, 0.45, 0.3], ""], [73584, "2019-05-17T19:39:14Z", [0.03, 0.12, 0.3, 0.35, 0.2], ""], [73583, "2019-05-17T19:38:26Z", [0.12, 0.5, 0.32, 0.05, 0.01], ""], [54817, "2019-05-17T19:36:22Z", [0.0, 0.35, 0.5, 0.15, 0.0], "Comment deleted on May 17, 2019 07:52PM UTC"], [70870, "2019-05-17T19:23:52Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.15], ""], [69394, "2019-05-17T19:12:05Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [70794, "2019-05-17T19:10:43Z", [0.05, 0.15, 0.35, 0.35, 0.1], ""], [68647, "2019-05-17T18:54:34Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.8], ""], [70330, "2019-05-17T18:48:13Z", [0.05, 0.15, 0.25, 0.4, 0.15], ""], [69222, "2019-05-17T18:32:11Z", [0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.5], "The polls keep swinging towards this eventuality."], [1333, "2019-05-17T18:26:38Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.4, 0.45, 0.1], ""], [72922, "2019-05-17T18:22:18Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.35, 0.6, 0.05], "Current polls already show a strong lead for the Brexit party.

The Brexit Party is now the Nigel Farage Party and that seems to be polling slightly below the level that UKIP was in 2014. There so far seems to little sign of the residual  4% of UKIP supporter switching to Brexit. So my guess is that 2% or so of the UKIP support which switch to Brexit, but either 3% or so of Brexit Party voters will not turn out or they will switch (back) to the Conservatives. So at this stage unless anything dramatic happens my guess is that the final Brexit percentage will be close to what it is today (29%).\nIts also interesting that for all the talk of Labour supporters changing their support to other parties their percentage support today is only 2% down on the 2014 result. The bigger shift that has taken place is that the Conservatives are down about 10%, while the several Leave supporting parties have picked up about 8% to 10% compared to 2014. \nThe UK local elections seem to have had the effect of reminding Remain voters that even under the D'Hondt system a vote for a party that is under 10% (in any Region) could end up with no seats."], [57797, "2019-05-09T11:12:57Z", [0.0, 0.08, 0.4, 0.37, 0.15], "Based on polls [1] and comments by @Tetbury that Conservatives votes may move to the Brexit party [2] My forecast is based on the presumption that voters will use this opportunity to voice their view on Brexit rather than vote for the party they'd typically support.

I assume this is reflected in the polling.\nIf the Conservatives and Labour parties become clearer on what their Brexit position is between now and the 23rd, the voting share for the party would change a lot. e.g. If the Conservative and Labour agree to a Brexit Future Trade Agreement both parties would lose Remainer votes to the LibDems and ChangeUK, and Leave votes to the Brexit Party. For this reason think both Conservativea and Labour will avoid reaching any agreement before the 23rd. Its quite likely that the Conservative vote will shrink below the 13% predicted in the polls.\nSo I would forecast that support in the polls for The Brexit Party to rise to over 35% between now and 23rd, but will fall back to between 30% and 35% at the actual vote\nThis election is only considered a protest vote for Leave and Remain, so few people with be concerned about voting with the party that they would normally support in a National Election.
