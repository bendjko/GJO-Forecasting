Some of the proposals put forward would technically allow for utilities to recover funds from 2018 fires, though such allowance would be incidental to implementing these recommendations, not instrumental within them. AKA implementing their recommendations would allow for the possibility of fund recovery from 2018 fires by increasing rates, but would not in itself allow for utilities to immediately do so (i.e. fault-based standard).
