However, I concede that the sample size from which I'm drawing this conclusion is only 3 or 4 instances, which is not enough to render this conclusion foolproof. On another hand, at the time of writing, there needs to be a 26% drop in order to meet 25k or under, which is not impossible but relatively doesn't happen as often, especially with the week or so left that the question is open. I guess this forecast is more a reflection of my ignorance on this subject matter than what the true probability of the event occurring is.

The only question is when, and July 1 is fast approaching.   Bitcoin has no use value in legitimate commerce for which there are no substitutes, that could lead to a higher bitcoin use value.  There is a small chance that bitcoin could substitute for a percentage, e.g., 10 to 25 percent, of the gold that is held as a store of value.   This would greatly increase Bitcoin's value.   However, this is unlikely because bitcoin uses a lot of electricity just to remain in existence; bitcoin cannot be used for any non-commerce purpose, e.g., gold jewelry, electronics,; and, bitcoin is at least twice as volatile and therefore more risky on the downside.  (Someone buying an asset as a store probably does not want much risk.) This isn't the first question that I have answered where public perceptions determined the value of something.  In those challenges, the persistence of the public in propping up the value of an asset or interest rate despite the fundamentals always lasted a lot longer than I thought possible.  Admittedly, I was just wrong in some of those.  But in others,  I was right on target in estimating the outcome based upon the fundamentals but not in the timeframe.  For example,  I predicted the interest rate for a specific type of mortgage would fall below a certain level while the economy was going down at the beginning of the Covid recession.  This prediction seemed to be a \"no brainer\" based upon the economic theory I learned in college.  Unfortunately for my Brier score, the interest rate bounced around above the target rate until after the end of the challenge.  I was sure of my analysis because the answer seemed so obvious for anyone who took even a first course in macroeconomics.   I kept checking the website used to determine the answer, and it did go down to a number very close to what I expected--but months after the challenge ended.

To estimate the prob of rising above 100k, I looked at the interval between peaks of double-price. I only found 1 suitable point of an interval from 2018 to 2021 to go from a price of 20k to 60k.

The issue is I don't know how much of the purchasing was people who actually believe in digital gold vs. people speculating on other people believing it, since both positions would encourage people to promote the idea in similar ways. There's also people speculating on Bitcoin because its volatile and conceptually simple. If the digital gold narrative being disproven becomes a narrative itself then it'd be a lot more impactful if most of the purchasing is speculative, people who actually believe in digital gold would probably be less phased by volatility (...it's Bitcoin, volatility isn't new). On the other hand speculation on other people's beliefs would probably be a lot more sensitive to new narratives since its all second-hand and its more difficult to think for people who aren't yourself. I have no idea if anything I'm saying is sensical, it's all circular and I'm working from the assumption that a lot of these positions are rational which implies a lot of conscious thought goes into Bitcoin purchasing.

That narrative should have some staying power, since there's probably going to be little change in the priorities of the Fed or Biden administration to the extent that it could undermine it, even though it could potentially be undermined by other factors. There appears to be much more institutional interest than there was before as well, but that's no guarantee that institutional investors aren't interested with full expectation of historic volatility and willingness to go with it, providing less of a countervailing force to market momentum than they do in other contexts.  I lower the 25k or less bucket because of a number of factors. A crypto hedge fund noted that there's a lot of interested buyers around the $28k mark that could make a support level around there (https://www.coindesk.com/why-is-bitcoin-going-up-and-will-it-crash), and if I had to eyeball it treating bitcoin as I would a stock, I'd say there should be a support around $30k, or around the trough after the first peak in the recent rally. A further crash doesn't seem as likely as it did when I was watching the original 2017 bitcoin rally because there's actually a halfway-decent narrative attached this time that people can make decisions around, as well as much more institutional interest. These factors lead me to assume it\u2019s less momentum driven than before and should be more stable going forward. That said, it's still bitcoin, and there's bound to be a lot of retail investors throwing money at it and adding volatility. The same article linked before noted a lot of bitcoin purchases at $600, the amount sent out in the first stimulus. GME was retail driven and dropped 85%. There\u2019s a lot of notable differences between the bitcoin and GME, but the chance of a huge crash is real. Overall, below $25k is possible given bitcoin\u2019s history, but there's more working against that kind of sharp crash than there was last time around, leading me to significantly discount it. As for $100k, it's more likely since Bitcoin has had a sharp upward trend over the past several months. I wouldn't have predicted that bitcoin would jump another 50% within 2 months when it was at $40k, so my intuition isn't super good here. However, the most recent spike is not on the same scale as the 50% jump, it was only higher by a few thousand dollars. That may indicate that the growth is slowing down, and price potentially settling. After all, if the dominant trend is BTC as a safe haven asset, then the main factor to consider is amount of money flowing in, and it\u2019s been a story so long that it might be the case that most of the interested parties have already invested, so there's less money coming into drive the price higher, and minimal exits since the intent is less speculative. The inflation fears that a lot of people cite will take months if not years to materialize (as mentioned below). Further, most stimulus checks have already been direct deposited as well, so if that was part of the recent rally then that should significantly slow down too. Lastly, GME peaked about 50% higher after its initial meteoric rise to $300 and its becoming a national story, and bitcoin has done the same since its recent rise to $40k. Though I'm openly predicting different ends based on the specifics of the two cases, 50% may be roughly the amount of rise that you can expect from FOMO investors following a news story. That's more of a personal theory to keep track of going forward than a weighted consideration. All these factors make a near-doubling in price in the next 3 months less likely.  Lastly, looking at the PCE price index data that just got released, inflation is still low at 1.6 but it is trending upwards nonetheless, which should help the inflation fear narrative that\u2019s driving people to bitcoin. It's only up to 1.6 from 1.4 though, which is still below the 2.0 the Fed aims for, so it\u2019s more maintenance of the narrative than a substantive change. Considering the timeframe associated with this question it only bumps the $100k bucket a point or two up, since inflation growing at this rate is a very long term fear.

Although, it does have too much of a tendency to put the frighteners up investors, so it's more likely to be a chop-shop this year. My 5% guesstimation rests both on the intestinal fortitude of investors (which hasn't shown to be made of iron re: BTC)  along with the fact that there will be more companies on the 'up' once COVID has settled, so investors could have exited the BTC safe-haven they've been sitting in for the first half of the year.

OK, not proverbial but ought to be. On the one hand, massive market manipulation typically leads to a crash. See, for example, https://priceonomics.com/how-the-hunt-brothers-cornered-the-silver-market/. See also  Stein's Law, \"If something cannot go on forever, it will stop.\" So if all that is going on in this market is manifulation by shadowy forces, a fall back below $25 K is a matter of when, not whether.  On the second hand, the computational/electricity/cooling costs of increasing the stock of Bitcoins has been increasing spectacularly. Nobody any more is \"mining\" bitcoin in their basements. Now it takes massive server farms running on cheap hydropower, cold climate for cheaper heat  sinking, and compliant local authorities. See, for example, https://www.genesis-mining.com/. So there won't be a rush of new bitcoins minted -- how many places are there left to build these mines at costs per bitcoin that could make a profit? In addition, the Hunt brothers were crashed by a sudden flood of millions of people selling their old silverware for scrap at sky high prices. By contrast,  there might not be a hidden source of bitcoin holders sufficient and willing to take their profits in enough quantities to drive the price below $25K before the forecast horizon. On the third hand, Elon Musk, having been bitten by the SEC for openly manipulating Tesla stock (https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-219). So far he apparently has been getting away with it, judging by the gigantic bubble in Tesla stock. I call it a bubble because it seems unlikely that Tesla really is worth more than all its competitors combined. So now he's publicly touting bitcoin, most recently by offering to exchange Teslas for bitcoin. Not surprisingly, this seems to be contributing bitcoin's soaring price. So Musk might well mobilize his believers to keep bitcoin above $25K well past the forecast horizon. Another factor in stabilizing bitcoin above $25K is the \"hodlers,\" people who have persistently waited for higher prices, many of whom think it could surpass $1M if only they hold out. If the population of dedicated hodlers has increased, then bitcoin might never drop below $25K. On the fourth hand,  over the last week bitcoin has been faltering, depite trading levels consistent with those over the last half year. So this faltering cannot be blamed upon an increase ifn profit taking.

However, we can at least use some historical information to give us an idea of where we stand today and how got here. It first hit $25K on December 26 of last year. Then it had an amazing run up and has recently had a pretty substantial drop followed by a slightly slower, but continuing drop in value. Part of the run-up had to do with some memery (reports are, in fact, that Elon Musk is being investigated for some of his tweets - https://electrek.co/2021/02/25/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-reportedly-under-sec-investigation-over-dogecoin-tweets/) as well as some relatively large corporations (including Tesla) taking some fairly large positions in Bitcoin (https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/tesla-buys-1point5-billion-in-bitcoin.html). I think, though, that folks may be reading a bit too much in to the Tesla investment - they've just announced that they'll accept payment in Bitcoin and as such, they need to have a fairly hefty reserve in order to weather the volatility of the pricing of the underlying currency. In other words, I think it says more about their own business model and desire to expand services than it does about the company's belief in the intrinsic value of Bitcoin itself. I think it's highly unlikely Bitcoin will more than double again in the next four months (though \"highly\" is relative given the volatility here). We did see it happen back in Feb-May of 2019, but we didn't see a doubling of the price again until August of last year, and that took almost 6 months (from about $5.8K in March to about $12K in August). The last time we saw an increase of a magnitude similar to that that we've seen recently was at the end of 2017 and the price had stabilized by the middle of February, then sat in a more normal range for a while.  Based on all of that, then, I'd expect there to be very little chance we bounce again past $100K - look for the next bounce to happen perhaps not until the end of this year (if at all). It's more likely that we'd see the price fall back to where it was before the meteoric rise, though again, the last time this happened, back in 2018, we saw the return right around now.
