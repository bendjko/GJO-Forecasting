An absolute value move that size (to the upside or downside) is about a 2.18 standard deviation event since 2007 (I looked less before then since the oil production picture in the U has changed massively). Using that alone would imply about a 2% chance. However, the US has produced 13 million bpd as late as early 2020 (spare capacity) and oil prices are up significantly. Given that EIA estimates 11 bpd tis year and 11.8 bpd in 2021, I would keep a low probability for exceeding 12 million in 2021, but significantly above what the historical z-score move would imply.  https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/report/us_oil.php\n"], [1333, "2021-06-25T11:17:42Z", [0.1], ""], [94872, "2021-06-25T06:57:10Z", [0.18], ""], [95992, "2021-06-25T02:53:46Z", [0.1], "Would need a very fast surge in oil production relative to history "], [8826, "2021-06-24T18:37:47Z", [0.9], ""], [55987, "2021-06-24T16:26:04Z", [0.18], ""], [1333, "2021-06-24T09:21:16Z", [0.09], ""], [14266, "2021-06-24T09:19:37Z", [0.14], ""], [529, "2021-06-23T22:25:48Z", [0.31], "https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&s=wcrfpus2&f=4"], [1333, "2021-06-23T09:22:17Z", [0.08], ""], [82102, "2021-06-22T21:54:45Z", [0.5], ""], [1333, "2021-06-22T13:03:30Z", [0.07], ""], [101031, "2021-06-22T05:39:39Z", [0.55], "oil price and rig count still rising, still looking possible."], [88452, "2021-06-22T00:31:09Z", [1.0], "https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/oil/062121-raisi-backs-irans-jcpoa-negotiating-team-but-says-trust-issues-with-us-an-obstacle"], [691, "2021-06-21T19:48:09Z", [0.3], ""], [16093, "2021-06-21T18:26:42Z", [0.01], ""], [1333, "2021-06-21T13:11:39Z", [0.06], ""], [94872, "2021-06-20T23:12:02Z", [0.22], ""], [101450, "2021-06-20T22:42:43Z", [0.05], "Control the controllable."], [1333, "2021-06-20T09:30:07Z", [0.03], ""], [87691, "2021-06-20T04:42:29Z", [1.0], ""], [56, "2021-06-19T20:34:36Z", [0.05], "Used the data from the site.

Found this excerpt quite useful from the EIA June 21 report\nWe expect that the rig count is likely to continue to increase in response to WTI crude oil prices rising from less than $50/b in late 2020 to a monthly average of $65/b in May. Our models show changes in rig counts typically lag behind changes in the WTI price from between three and six months, and production typically comes online about two months after rig deployment. Assuming that other factors remain constant, price increases over the past month will likely continue to drive rig deployments through much of the rest of 2021. However, the recent changes in rig counts indicate operators, notably in the Permian, could be deploying fewer rigs at current oil prices than they have previously deployed when oil prices were at similar levels.

There is a lot of details that are available and you can easily find yourself spending days trough through. The current EIA forecast has the production below at 11.38 Mbbl/d. Although looking at current oil prices above $70/bbl and their forecast has prices going down to ~$60 for Q4. EIA, like many strip prices are usually slow to adapt to a changes in price. The current oil price should bump up their forecast for Q4 and therefore production numbers should also increase.  In OPECs June Market report they have US crude production going to 11.6 Mbbl/d in December. June has already seen a $5/bbl rise from May in which the OPEC forecast is based off of. With this increased price with the hopes of the world economy reopening, their next month forecast should reflect an uptick based on this optimism.  I also believe with the weakening of the US dollar will increase oil exports. My main worry is that a ~700,000 bbls/d extra in the market will depress prices and won't sustain a 12 Mbbl/d production for 4 weeks. Given the recent optimism with a higher oil price, I believe there is a shot at a 4 week period to be higher than 12 Mbbl/d (67%).
