I dont expect the inflation to level off just yet, they are still in massive problems, namely the deterioation in their oil industry is still crushing their economy. According to the study on hyperinflation \"On the Measurement of Zimbabwe\u2019s Hyperinflation\" they conclude that the average hyperinflation period is around 20 months. Mind you with huge uncertainty given the very little data i.e. about 25-30 hyperinflation incidences in the 21st and 20th century and with uncertainty in gathering data. According to the con leche index, hyperinflation \"began\" around november 2018 - december 2018, given that the price doubled from 195 to 400 bolivars, a rapid increase. That is about 6-7 months of hyperinflation, vastly less than the average hyperinflation period of 20 months. Furthermore, even if inflation did suddenly drop to 1-2% per month, the annual inflation would still be higher. Thus, for the annual inflation rate to become less than 50,000%, we need to go from hyperinflation to deflation, which i dont believe is impossible but highly unlikely. The trend in annual inflation rate is slowing down, thus, i do think that it will grow, but i dont think it will in a matter of a few months grow beyond 100,000%. It is quite likely it does, but the most likely scenario given the current trend, the lower growth in M2 i expect inflation to be between 50,000-100,000% by september. 100,000-200,000 will be my next most likely scenario and will have the highest probability.

But I'm making my prediction without that - because simply looking at the numbers would make >50,000% almost impossible. My thinking...\n- This is a 1 year inflation rate at 25 Sep - so the starting point is 50 Bolivars on Sep 26 (*not* the 10 Bolivars that is the current start of the 12mo inflation chart)\n- For inflation to be above 50,000% on Sep 25 would require a coffee to cost 25,000 - 3.8x what it is today (6,500)\n- Looking at a rolling 3mo price increase, the last 6 months have been 18x, 10x, 6.6x, 2.9x, 2.75x, 2.2x - so a 3.8x increase would be a huge change based on that trend\n- Simply fitting a polynomial trend to the data from Sep 26 2018 out to Sep 25 2019 gives us a final price of ~8,300 (the R-squared is 0.971 - I realise economics and geopolitics isn't maths, but I'm only arguing that 50,000 is near impossible here!)\n- With a final price of 8,300 Bolivar, that gives us inflation of 16,500% from the 50 Bolivar coffee on Sep 26 2018. A very safe margin of error from 50,000%. Interestingly:\n- Calculated from the starting point of 10 Bolivar, a final price of 8,300 would result in 82,900% inflation - but that would be across 15 months, not 12.

Unless your currency is the basis that the world is set by printing unlimited fiat is ultimately a futile event. Power is inversely proportional to money. So a dictator thinks that the more money he has the more power he has. So if his power starts to wane he prints more money to even the balance. As his power continues to wane he prints more fiat to make up for his declining power. Power is actually directly proportionate to belief. If someone actual believes in you they will give themselves over to you.

So, any plan to address hyperinflation is likely to require a change in leadership, with a plan taking at least a few months to implement.  The crowd forecast for a Maduro departure by the end of September 2019 is currently at 16% [1]. Given the lead time to implement a plan, I've discounted the chance of bringing inflation under control (< 50k%) to 10%. Without a plan, I would expect hyperinflation to continue, although I have no idea how to forecast what range that will be in.   The current Cafe Con Leche Index places the price at 5,500 new bolivars, unchanged for the past four readings in the month of May.  The Index calculated inflation at just under 100k%.  However, the IMF is forecasting 2019 inflation rate of 10 million per cent [2]. Without a plan, I would expect inflation rates to continue to rise from current levels, and possibly accelerate.

Both rates hovered around this value until late April, when the black market surged and the official exchange rate followed suit, being set at 5,200 BsS per dollar. This BCV policy, along with measures to restrict the amount of Bolivars, has been credited for slowing down the economy\u2019s inflationary spiral, with inflation registered at 18,1 and 44,7 percent in March and April, respectively, according to the opposition-controlled National Assembly\u2019s finance commission. \nhttps://venezuelanalysis.com/news/14479 Venezuela: Maduro Announces Economic Reforms Including Monetary Reconversion, Tax Breaks & Currency Control Changes\nhttps://venezuelanalysis.com/news/13967 Looks like the economic reforms worked in braking the inflation rate to a more manageable 40-50% montly inflation rate.

There is certain pattern (with such a small sample) in the price of the cup, about doubling after being unchanged for 3 or 4 weeks, kind of changing prices by the end of every month. This does not need to be the case, but using this pattern, it will double again 4 or 5 times before Sept 25th. That would take the rate to 175,900% or 351,900%. Hyperinflation situation has been very well described by The Economist here [1]. It is \"a monetary phenomenon, with printing presses running nonstop\", (SPOILER ALERT) Money Heist type [3], due to a \"politically unmanegable fiscal burden\" [1]. Same article mentions that hyperinflation can end in a question of weeks, if a \"credible policy shift\" occurs: \"sustainable fiscal consolidation, [\u2026] credible pledge to stop funding [by printing money] and commitment to a new monetary framework\". \"New political leadership often helps, as does external financial support\". On the question, I set some % for such a simple rate being manipulated (to go down), a 10% chance.\nAssuming it is not, we do have some forecasts from the IMF [2] which puts it at 10^6 % at year end, but IMF figures have been questioned by academics [4]. A discouraging note: \"The IMF and the press are clearly unaware of the fact that hyperinflation can be measured, and measured very accurately, but it cannot be forecasted\" [4]. But this is Good Judgment anyway, so I'll give it a try: how likely is the \"credible policy shift\" to happen, and if so, will it have time before Sept 25th to reduce significantly?\n- Maduro (or similar) continues ruling the country, unable to access the funds from oil, only supported by Russia and maybe China, and with the need to \"buy\" the military's support. In this case, hyperinflation could reach 500,000% or more. While I really wish this happens soon, reality checks and Guaid\u00f3 lacks the trust of the Venezuelan people. This is the reason it takes so long to the inevitable change of regime. Sadly, only 50% chance it happens before August and split 25/75 below and higher 500,000%, weight on the lose of trust in the currency creating a vicious circle.\n- Government changes by August, 50% chance, measures are implemented, external financial support will come, petro-dollars flow again and trust is regained. It's a question of weeks, as per The Economist [1], and other cases show that disinflation can be experienced quickly [5]. 50% for less than 50,000% and 50% in the 200,000% (short time). \"For long-suffering Venezuelans, that cannot come too soon\" [1] [1] https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2019/01/31/hyperinflations-can-end-quickly-given-the-right-sort-of-regime-change\n[2] https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/PCPIPCH@WEO/WEOWORLD/VEN\n[3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_Heist\n[4] https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevehanke/2018/07/31/imf-produces-another-bogus-venezuela-inflation-forecast/#42f768c47dc8\n[5] https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevehanke/2019/01/16/zimbabwes-monetary-death-spiral/#4fc5eedc35e7"], [20156, "2019-05-26T06:09:37Z", [0.1, 0.15, 0.35, 0.25, 0.15], ""], [691, "2019-05-25T11:50:18Z", [0.1, 0.5, 0.3, 0.05, 0.05], ""], [71002, "2019-05-24T22:56:40Z", [0.3, 0.6, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [74107, "2019-05-24T19:39:27Z", [0.2, 0.7, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0], ""]], "open_date": "2019-05-24T16:45:47Z", "close_date": "2019-09-24T06:59:47Z"}
