Unfortunately, ACLED doesn't tell us which side the fatalities are on, but let's make a simplifying (if unrealistic) assumption of parity; 18% of all fatal incidents involving Turkish troops in Syria involve more than 8 fatalities.

There is a lot of ambiguity in this forecast. Partly because there is no set standard in determining if it has happened or not. Libya is a hotbed for misinformation and both Turkey and the LNA are under incentives to misreport fatality information. On February 25th there was a confrontation in Misrata where Turkish armed forces were involved. However, Erdogan admitted to 2 deaths whereas General Hftar bragged about 16. This incident demonstrates how future confrontations will likely play out: Erdogan wants the fatalities under-reported so that the Turkish public supports his foreign adventurism whereas Hftar wants them over-reported to galvanize his troops. The existence of Syrian mercenaries brought over by Turkey complicates this because some fatalities might not actually be Turkish (but are they still fighting with \"the Turkish armed forces\"?).  If I were to forecast alone on the probability that this would actually happen with the assumption of accurate reporting I would probably be between 55-60% since there is a good chance it has already happened (according to General Hftar at least). However I don't think there will be accurate reporting unless the incident is really dramatic and there are some structural factors keeping it from being dramatic.

Further factors suggesting caution on the part of Turkish troops:\n1) Turkish strategy doesn't appear to favour direct conflict, which would exacerbate regional tensions. Instead it seeks, by the presence of troops, to ensure it has a say any ceasefire and diplomatic discussions.\nSee https://www.politico.eu/article/road-to-peace-in-libya-goes-through-turkey-khalifa-haftar/ and https://www.dailysabah.com/op-ed/2020/01/13/turkeys-troops-in-libya-whats-their-mission\n2) The measure was domestically controversial and direct casualties would exacerbate domestic difficulties.

Situations in East Mediterranean, Syria and Ukraine are the main stages that determine the future of Libyan conflict. Some of the dynamics driving the level of tensions in these three stages are mainly political, diplomatic and economic. We know Haftar is well supported by Russia because Russia needs to have control over the supply of oil (due to sanctions). Kremlin related Wagner troops have been fighting for Haftar. On the other hand Turkey had no choice but to support Sarraj because Greek and Cypriot EEZ advancements threatened its sovereign rights over its continental shelf. So, it sought sea neighbors to back its EEZ claims to cancel Greek EEZ claims. \nRussia also backs Assad in Syria. Turkey is against Assad. In Syria, Russia and Turkey are disputing over Idlib province. Because of this dispute a military confrontation began lately and resulted with TSK casualties. Although Russia's aim toward Idlib is more complex (securing Iran's Latakia settlement to relieve pressure on Russian military settlements in Tartus) than it seems, it directed SAA to use more lethal force than usual on Turkish positions in the most recent counteroffensives. The reason for that was Russia's loss of 4 FSB special operations agents during Turkish led offensive toward Aleppo. So, that makes TSK casualties are result of a Russian retaliation. This means the risk of heightened conflict in Idlib may actually be lower than expected. \nHowever, the exchange of attacks led Turkey to take political steps in Ukraine. Turkey expressed support for Kiev and stated that it would not recognize Crimea as Russian territory. Turkey also beefed up its observation points in Idlib. Ankara stated that Syrian army and whoever are with them would be hit hard unless Syrian army retreat back to the line agreed in Sochi. Russian sponsored Haftar had left negotiations after Turkey insisted on conditions of ceasefire which Moscow also had disagreed in some terms. This shows Haftar does what Kremlin tells him to do. \nThere have been Turkish attacks in Libya against Haftar positions. Russian drones were downed outside Tripoli by Turkey backed groups, again in retaliation of similar Haftar offensives. Turkey deployed some radical proxies from idlib to Tripoli and sent armed vehicles and tanks. Such steps were to pose deterrence for Kremlin, which has been fighting in many other theaters in various different regions. Despite all these developments, we have not yet seen a serious all-out offensive has been taken against Turkish positions by Haftar. One of the most important reasons for that is Kremlin's understanding that Turkish soldiers are protecting and supporting a UN recognized government in Libya, and that any attack on Turkish troops would risk Haftar's legitimacy, therefore would undermine Russia's gains in Libya. \nTurkey is using its own troops mainly for conducting training, arming and consulting missions for Sarraj army in Libya. In turn, its military existence is much smaller in size compared to Idlib. This is also a factor lowering the possibility of casualties from Turkish side.\nHowever, if, by the end of this month Assad forces do not retreat back to the line Ankara has mentioned, there is a likelihood that a Turkish offensive in response may cause some Russian casualties on Syrian side, an answer to which may be coupled by Haftar's heavy artillery to Tripoli, resulting Turkish casualties.\nSo there's still a possibility of a lethal confrontation that may result in 8 or more deaths from TSK side in Libya.The main determinant for that likelihood will be Syrian army's position at the end of this month (Feb 2020) and the Turkish response to that. US support for Turkish offensive, as well as Turkey's geographical advantage may deter Russia which may result with Assad's retreat back to Sochi line.  I believe the likelihood of a lethal conflict causing deaths of Turkish troops in Libya will remain low within the next 5 months because diplomatic relations between Kremlin and Ankara aren't damaged as severe for Russia to order an attack on UN recognized government's positions which most of the Turkish troops are located at.

General Hafter who is fighting UN backed government is backed by Russia and UAE and has refused a ceasefire so fighting continues. Russia has a warming relationship with Turkey but that can go bad quickly. In Syria they are a odds over idlib. Russia bombing there is causing many refugees headed to Turkey. Russia has regular troops along with the mercenaries. Now Russia could have mercenaries kill some Turkish troops to cause Erdogan problems at home. Might not as just as Russia is trying to reestablish its Russian empire so Turkey dreams of Ottoman times. These two have been in competition for centuries.
