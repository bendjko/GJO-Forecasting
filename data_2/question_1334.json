Incentive-wise, given that the NCAA and the federal legislature have gotten involved, and given that NCAA legal team told the 9th Circuit Appeals court that they believe the CA law is unconstitutional, I'm guessing most other states will see state-level NIL initiatives as a waste of time they could be spending on other things.

According to multiple sites, the NCAA's board of governors voted on 29 October to allow college athletes to be compensated for the use of the name, image, and likeness (NIL).  Several states have bills drafted and at various stages of drafting or approval including: Florida, New York, Illinois, Kentucky, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Washington, Maryland, Connecticut, and South Carolina.  I have outlined the status of a few known bills at the state level based on an article from CBS sports journalist Matt Norlander.   According to the NY Senate website, Senate bill S6722B is in the Senate Rules committee as of 2 January 2020.  An Assembly bill A8620 was introduced in October and remains in the higher education committee as of 2 Jan.  This law goes beyond just NIL rights and extends to a form of revenue sharing.  To become law, the bill still needs to pass through committee, be scheduled for debate on the floor, pass both the assembly and the Senate and then signed by the Governor.  Unlike the California bill, the NY bill does not have bipartisan sponsorship.  The breadth of sponsorship is less of a factor for passage since the Democratic party has a majority in both chambers, however, it may slow down the proceedings. The New York legislature will be in session for only 38 days between now and 1 April.  The schedule for the bill's next steps are unclear - no known scheduled meetings or hearings.  Due to the expanded scope of this bill and the deadline for the question, it is unlikely this bill will pass in the time allotted.   The Illinois bill (HB3904) has passed the house, and moved into the senate in November of last year.  The bill is currently assigned to a subcommittee in the senate.  The bill is the only one assigned to the Subcommittee.  The bill has broad, though largely partisan, sponsorship.  The Illinois legislature will only be in session for 23 days prior to 1 April and has a deadline of 27 March for substantive bills to leave committee.  Though this bill seems to be making steady progress, the spring schedule appears to leave little time for the passage and signature into law prior to 1 April.   Washington state had a bill introduced at the beginning of 2019, but the bill does not appear to have moved since that time.   According to the Florida house website, the Florida House Bill 251 was referred to 3 separate committees on 10 October 2019 and has not progressed since that time.  Three other related bills (S 582, H287, and S646) were also referred to committee between 16 October and 6 November.  Two bills (1 house, 1 senate) are sponsored by democrats and 2 bills (1 house, 1 senate) are sponsored by Republicans.  Both parties have sponsored bills which seek an effective date in 2020.    The session ends on 13 March 2020.  It is likely FL will pass the bill and have it signed into law prior to 1 April.   I highly recommend the website legiscan.com for research on legislative affairs at the state level.  It provides a good starting place if you have only basic details.

Georgia\u2019s soon-to-be senior senator has joined a bipartisan working group attempting to deal with the implications of a suddenly viral concept that burst from the West Coast only three months ago: That athletes should get a piece of the $14 billion in annual revenue that colleges and universities collect courtesy of their sweat and pain. . . . similar efforts [to California's] in 20 or more states have jumped up, blurring the political line that separates red and blue. In Georgia, state Rep. Billy Mitchell, D-Stone Mountain, says that by the time the Legislature convenes in January, his measure, House Bill 743, will have more Republican signatures than Democratic ones.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, has endorsed like-minded legislation.\u201cSo here we go,\u201d Perdue said in a phone interview. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have an arms race between states about recruiting high school kids for college sports. That\u2019s a problem. All of a sudden now, we need a level playing field. .  . .  In October, Romney issued a warning to the NCAA, which has long balked at loosening rules on athlete compensation.\u201cWe\u2019re coming for you,\u201d Romney said. \u201cWe\u2019re coming to help these young athletes in the future, and the athletes of today, make sure that they don\u2019t have to sacrifice their time and sacrifice, in many cases, their bodies without being fairly compensated.\u201d\n. . . \n. . .  A 2017 poll by the Washington Post found that 54% of African-Americans support paying college athletes, but only 31% of whites felt the same. There was broader consensus \u2013 89% among blacks, 60% among whites \u2014 on permitting players to earn money if their name or image is used on merchandise.This is where most legislation, state and federal, appears to be headed. \u201cThat\u2019s the easiest to get at first. It\u2019s not the only issue,\u201d Perdue said.But even that has complications. Consider the fleet-footed star running back and the anonymous lineman who plows the field ahead of him. \u201cHow do you allow a kid to get paid signing jerseys with his name on the back? And then, how do you split that with the other players on the team, and the university?\u201d Perdue asked.Or should you? There is a labor-versus-management aspect to the issue of athletic pay. Booker and most other Democratic presidential candidates have endorsed allowing athletes to earn money from their names and images. Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts support allowing players to unionize as well.Others, and Perdue is among them, emphasize the preservation of college sports as an institution in a shifting landscape.\u201cMy concern is that we don\u2019t have agents sitting in kitchens signing contracts with high school kids and negotiating contracts \u2013 instead of being recruited by colleges, destroying the student athlete,\u201d he said.Five years ago, the NCAA benched star UGA tailback Todd Gurley for four games \u2014 for accepting money from autograph dealers. The Legislature quickly passed, and the governor signed into law, a measure aimed at those who tempt college athletes into risking their amateur status. The penalty: Jail time and a fine of up to $25,000.Those days appear to be on the edge of extinction.In late October, meeting on the campus of Emory University, the NCAA\u2019s top governing body voted unanimously to allow athletes to be paid for use of their name, image and likeness \u201cin a manner consistent with the collegiate model.\u201dWhat that collegiate model is has yet to be defined. Perdue said the NCAA is expected to come up with preliminary rules in January, with a final decision coming in April. The Power Five conferences, the SEC among them, are working on the issue as well.The senator hopes the two groups can come up with a solution that will pass muster with Congress.

The legislation is to take place in 2023.  The long delay for the law to go into effect is due to the expected lawsuits from NCAA and other schools.  Indeed, NCAA threatens to ban CA schools from participation in NCAA sports if the law goes into effect.  The law is also a way to prod NCAA into reforms. In fact, after the legislation was introduced in February, NCAA formed a working group to look into the matter.  Its final report is due in October [1]. There is no question a school allowing student athletes to receive financial compensation for their names will have a big advantage in recruiting athletes.  Will other states join the bandwagon?  I suspect not within the time frame of this forecast.  One reason is that the CA law does not come into effect until 2023 \u2013 there is no need to hurry.  The second reason is that NCAA might change the rule after its committee studied the issue.  If so, there is no need for other states to pass legislation for it. Furthermore, allowing student athletes to receive financial compensation for their names is a low bar compared with paying athletes.  It does not cost the schools (and NCAA) much, if any.  Therefore it is relatively easy for NCAA to change its rule on this.  If NCAA changes the rule allowing this, no school gains advantage or loses disadvantage.  While NCAA wants to maintain the facade of amateurism in its multi-million business, I suspect it will reform on this issue.   I liken this to the collapse of amateurism in the Olympics. There is a chance of one or two states that join the bandwagon.  The probability is 2/50 = 4%.

The same, arguably, goes for Texas and Florida and several other states with very large collegiate sports audiences.   Also, if compensation gives permitting states a recruiting advantage, which might reasonably be expected, other states are likely to fall in line as briskly as they can arrange to.

It said the NCAA could declare California schools ineligible for its events, because giving players the right to earn money from endorsement deals would give California schools an unfair recruiting advantage. Despite the threat, the California legislature passed its bill unanimously. Newsom signed the legislation earlier this week alongside one of its most prominent backers, LeBron James. In a statement Monday, the PAC-12 Conference said the legislation would \u201chave very significant negative consequences for our student-athletes and broader universities in California.\u201d\n. . . \nOpponents say the new laws would cause damage to the current system, which provides scholarships and even spending money to thousands of student athletes across the country.\n. . . \nBut West, the Minnesota Republican, said paying athletes would both broaden the number of people who benefit from their talent during their college years, and incentivize more players to stay in school to actually earn their degree.  \u201cA lot of high school stars, like king of the town who just tears it up, will never make it to the NFL,\u201d West said. \u201cThe super good players who are real prospects for the professional leagues now do have an incentive to stay in school and get their degrees.\u201d The NCAA has been under mounting pressure to spread its wealth around, as college athletics have become a $14 billion a year industry. Thirty-eight schools around the country generate more than $100 million in sports revenue annually, according to data compiled by USA Today. The NCAA itself generated more than $1 billion in revenue for the first time in 2017. But, seemingly aware that the dam was about to break, the NCAA earlier this year set up a working group to study potential changes to rules governing student athlete endorsement deals. That working group plans to finish its report by the end of October. After that report comes out, federal legislation is likely. Rep. Anthony Gonzalez (R-Ohio), a standout wide receiver at Ohio State who went on to play for the Indianapolis Colts, plans to introduce a bill once he sees recommendations from the committee. Gonzalez is close with Ohio State athletic director Gene Smith, the committee\u2019s co-chairman. In March, Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.) has introduced his own legislation similar to the California measure. Walker\u2019s Student-Athlete Equity Act has yet to receive a hearing before the House Ways and Means Committee.\""], [1333, "2019-10-05T18:40:40Z", [0.64], ""], [79461, "2019-10-05T17:22:13Z", [0.15], "Sports Illustrated is tracking the variety of bills related to this question. [1] They suggest that about 9 states are considering laws on these issues. A few have been filed, but most are still in earlier stages of the legislative process. Politically, these bills do not seem to controversial  (both Republicans and Democrats supported them in California). So, the main problem here is whether these bills can go through the legislative pipeline fast enough. In addition, it's unclear to me what incentives are for other states to pass these bills. On one hand the NCAA is not a powerful lobbyist at the state level, but I don't think there is great political gain in passing any of these bills. Similarly, I don't think there is any urgency for policy makers on these questions. I doubt any will get through in this 6 month period, but in a year or two I would assign a much higher probability. \n\n[1] https://www.si.com/college-football/2019/10/02/tracking-ncaa-fair-play-image-likeness-laws"], [691, "2019-10-05T13:50:37Z", [0.12], ""], [42004, "2019-10-05T09:51:50Z", [0.15], ""], [691, "2019-10-04T19:33:39Z", [0.12], "Irrespective of the merits on this issue, the calendar is working against such a bill, which is certain to be controversial for reasons both good and the other thing.
