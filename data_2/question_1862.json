The balance between the member countries' income requirements and the global supply (including the US supply) and the coronavirus impact is a fine line.

Russia's PM said they will push for production increase.\nBefore December's meeting: \"In the run-up to this week\u2019s meeting, reports surfaced of discontent among smaller members \u2013 notably Iraq, Kazakhstan and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\" [1]\n\"Russia\u2019s deputy prime minister said the nation plans to support a further gradual increase in OPEC+ production at the next meeting in January, because crude prices are within an optimal range.\" [4] - Historically, if OPEC reduced production, there was a risk that America and others would gain more market share by increasing production. So if OPEC felt like that was a risk, that would be a reason to increase production. However, American shale oil production is down, so don't see this as a risk.\n\"Not only did some members consistently produce more than they promised to, but producers outside the agreement, such as America, seized the opportunity to increase their own market shares.\" [2]\n\"At the same time, U.S. shale oil production continues to decline. The latest \"Drilling Productivity Report\" from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed U.S. unconventional oil output averaged 7.70 million barrels per day in November and is expected to decline to 7.58 million b/d in December and 7.44 million b/d in January 2021.\" [5]\n\"In effect, what OPEC+ is trying to do is achieve a trifecta of increasing their volumes, keeping prices at least at current levels, and finally not surrendering market share to producers outside the group, such as the United States and Brazil.\" [3] Reasons to not adjust production:\n- Predictions going into December's meeting were that production would not be adjusted, and then production was increased, so it would make sense to not adjust production in January.\nBefore December's meeting: \"Alegria\u2019s energy minister, who currently holds OPEC\u2019s rotating presidency, reportedly said on Monday that the cartel reached a consensus to extend cuts by three months. That would reinforce the status quo on prices say, analysts, while a six-month extension would help clear the storage glut and lift prices meaningfully.\" [1]\n\"This week OPEC+ will debate a second such production increase. With new lockdowns further hurting demand, the coalition is expected to defer it. OPEC countries such as Nigeria and Iraq, struggling under the burdens of covid-19 and reduced oil revenue, are unhappy. But without a sustained increase in demand, the coalition has little choice but to put up with painful limits.\" [2] - Uncertainty in demand due to COVID, vaccine, lockdowns, and stimulus\n\"What this likely means is that more than OPEC+\u2019s 500,000 bpd may be added to the global markets in January, at a time when it\u2019s still too early for the multiple vaccines to have had any impact on boosting travel, or on opening borders.\" [3]\n\"\"We believe a material increase in oil demand is unlikely to happen before [the second quarter of 2021] when we expect vaccines to become widely available.\" To complicate matters, a new, faster-spreading virus has raised concerns that tighter restrictions will impact the oil demand recovery.\" [5] Reasons to decrease production: \n- I can't think of any because oil prices have been stable. No meeting before February 1:\n- OPEC+ meeting is scheduled Jan 4. Even if for some reason it didn't happen on Jan 4, there would still be plenty of time to reschedule.
