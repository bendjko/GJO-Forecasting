So let\u2019s assume the following: 2.2m per day is average per COVID, so to get back to this we need to get back to 90pc of pre COVID travel. Therefore both international and domestic travel have to recover to 90pc.  It\u2019s highly unlikely that international travel is anywhere near 90pc of pre COVID and domestic is probably at the most near 90pc. Airlines are also only scheduling about 60pc capacity which is in line with the numbers of travellers being reported (40pc less scheduled flights at about 80pc capacity (very rough maths)\nhttps://www.oag.com/coronavirus-airline-schedules-data Of course we only need one bumper travel day to fulfill this question, but with international travel going to take longer to get back to 90pc it would take a massive boost in domestic to tick over the threshold.  Let alone the fact that airlines actually have to schedule more flights. It will tick up over the summer, but everyone is being very cautious and I\u2019m guess international travel will take longest to recover.

Generally speaking June - August are busiest months running 10-15% above the fall/winter period. \n2) If we saw average numbers of ~1.6M going into a holiday weekend then we would be likely to hit this limit if we assume a 20% bump for the holiday.\n3) We are currently running about 57% of that 1.6M rate and trending up at 5% / month.

Those peaks were around holidays (Memorial Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas), with Memorial day being the current record holder. Generally speaking June - August are busiest months running 10-15% above the fall/winter period.\n2) assuming peak travel around holidays remains the norm (and I have no reason to believe that's not the case), then if we saw average numbers of ~1.6M going into Thanksgiving, Xmas or Memorial day then we would be likely to hit this limit if we assume a 20% bump for the holiday.\n3) 1.6M per day is almost 3x our current level and it is currently trending flat to down. Plus I would expect seasonal factors to be a headwind. To be clear: I do expect it to go up, but just not by 3x before December 31. \n4) The next bucket is before the peak season and doesn't include any major travel holidays. If we don't get there by Dec 31st, then we're not getting there by Mar 31. \n5) The other buckets seem to be in play and it's a question in my mind of whether it's Memorial day (May 31, 2021) weekend or not.  I allocated my percentages subjectively. i don't see much point in going over 70% on the last bucket at this point.
