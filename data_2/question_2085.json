The biggest concerns were whether the emergence of a new variant of the coronavirus might torpedo the budding global economic recovery, and the restiveness of the United States and key Asian customers, including China, over high oil prices. In the end,  the group known as OPEC Plus decided to take the easy route and stick with a previously agreed-to program of gradually adding oil to the market. It decided to raise production by 400,000 barrels a day in January, just as it has in recent months. But to show worried oil markets that they are ready to change that plan if needed, the producers said in a news release that their meeting would \u201cremain in session\u201d so the producers could monitor the market and \u201cmake immediate adjustments if required.\u201d That  statement, analysts said, was intended to warn traders that OPEC Plus was ready to reconsider its production levels, including possibly cutting supplies, anytime the market appeared threatened \u2014 even before the next meeting scheduled for Jan. 4. \u201cIt puts a floor under prices, saying you don\u2019t know what they are going to do,\u201d said Bhushan Bahree, an executive director at IHS Markit, a research firm. \u201cIt matches uncertainty with uncertainty.\u201d That message seemed to be sinking in, at least on Thursday. Prices dipped sharply as it emerged that OPEC Plus would raise production. But they recovered quickly, and later in the day futures were trading 1.7 percent higher, at about $70.10 a barrel for Brent crude, the international benchmark. The producers\u2019 decision to keep adding oil to the market for now was also \u201ca victory for the Biden administration,\u201d wrote Helima Croft, head of global commodities at RBC Capital Markets. President Biden\u2019s aides had pressured Persian Gulf producers to continue increasing production in the hope of reducing gasoline prices for American drivers. Though many analysts predicted that the group might pause the monthly increases it agreed on in July, or even cut output, others said the decision taken on Thursday made sense. No one yet knows whether the new Omicron variant will prove a big hit to the economy, a passing worry or something in between. A hasty halt to the production increases might also have sent a negative signal to the markets about the group\u2019s view of the global economy. At the moment, oil market fundamentals remain strong. In recent months, strong demand for oil and the producers\u2019 restraint on output have drained stockpiles to low levels. And analysts pointed out that future demand is probably holding up at least in the short term. \u201cMiddle East OPEC members will likely have seen good demand for their crude in January,\u201d analysts from FGE, a consulting firm, said in a report on Thursday, as Asian economies powered ahead. Maintaining the planned increase will probably also ease friction with the Biden administration, which last month orchestrated a planned release of oil stocks from the United States Strategic Petroleum Reserve in conjunction with smaller moves by other large oil consumers. The unusual rebellion over prices, which included China, Japan, India and South Korea, all key customers for Persian Gulf oil producers, is a worrying development for countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. It could ultimately threaten both their national finances, which are dependent on oil revenue, and their control of markets. The planned release of the oil reserves, coupled with the impact of the new variant, have pushed prices down more than 17 percent since the seven-year highs of about $85 a barrel reached in October \u2014 probably accomplishing much of what the White House wanted. Analysts say lower prices will not only ease tensions with Washington but also accomplish other OPEC Plus goals, including discouraging investment in shale oil drilling  in the United States. Current prices may also reduce the incentive for the Biden administration to reach a nuclear deal with Iran in ongoing indirect talks. An Iran free of sanctions could quickly put substantial volumes of oil on the market, a potential worry for Tehran\u2019s fellow members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, like Saudi Arabia. Some analysts say that OPEC Plus may just be postponing inevitable cuts in deference to Washington, and that it will need to squeeze output if it wants to protect prices. \u201cThe longer they wait, the more they may need to do,\u201d said Bill Farren-Price, a director at Enverus, a market research firm. Still, for a diverse group like OPEC Plus, sticking to a plan at a time of uncertainty is an easier sell than a change of course.\n~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  The key statement to me in this article was that their decisions put a floor under the price.  \n@ctsats, @JamesEE, @GMR "], [98345, "2021-12-03T04:42:08Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.03, 0.58, 0.39, 0.0], ""], [97892, "2021-12-03T00:38:29Z", [0.01, 0.04, 0.14, 0.26, 0.29, 0.26], ""], [81456, "2021-12-03T00:10:06Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.12, 0.77, 0.11, 0.0], ""], [67312, "2021-12-02T23:16:35Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.11, 0.77, 0.12, 0.0], ""], [101612, "2021-12-02T22:52:44Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.1], ""], [14027, "2021-12-02T20:36:39Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.13, 0.61, 0.26, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2021-12-02T19:39:39Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.7, 0.3, 0.0], ""], [103444, "2021-12-02T19:30:22Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5], ""], [102737, "2021-12-02T19:24:05Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.69, 0.3, 0.01], "Wow.

The situation we arrived at in April 2020 where the price plummeted to below zero is not likely to happen again as producers will be wary of the danger - hence i am discounting <$30 and giving <$45 a low chance.  Omicron has already exerted downward pressure on prices.  We have a better handle on Omicron's ability to evade vaccines by mid December.  Until then expect demand to drop and prices with it.  If Omicron proves to not be a serious risk to public health, prices will rebound.  I am giving this a fairly high chance.  If Omicron proves to be dangerous, or still an unknown quantity, demand will remain low, prices will stay below average (c.$69 for 2021).   Even if early data shows good vaccine response to Omicron, people who consider themselves more vulnerable will remain cautious and limit travel.  The holiday period in much of the world will also limit demand.  I am therefore discounting the highest brackets.

Extrapolation from some higher-order fits seems to create predictions that are more consistent with the most recent (last few weeks/last few months) trends, while simple \"straight-line\" fits provide a longer-range perspective through time. Since 2021 has had its share of major news events and uncertainty, residual errors from the fits might be interpretable as indicative of the most likely range of deviations--and their relative probability--that might be induced by future news events in the next few months (assuming the events are not too extreme in impact).

Will have to look into this more. @Scrappy posted the US Energy Info Administration Short Term Energy Spot Average forecasts for Q4 2021 that had it at 67.79. Will have to look into oil prices and how they work in more detail.

Right now I think the safest bet is in the middle. The 60-75 range represents fairly strong demand from strong economic activity. I don't think COVID is going to be a limiting factor on demand because even if there are mask mandates, the economy is up and running. I think the oil producers are biased toward pumping more and holding on to market share. I don't think inflation is going to push oil prices up -- the relationship tends to work the other way.
