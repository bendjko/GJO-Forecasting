Our generation has never experienced such an uncertain wild card like a major pandemic, and this extreme level of uncertainty is toxic for markets. Current optimism is misplaced, when in reality, the wreckage of Main Street will severely impact corporate activity. Add to this civil and geopolitical conflict, and a surge in new cases resulting from large recreational and protest gatherings. Almost every expert has added the caveat \"all bets are off if a 2nd wave\". Since we are somewhere near halftime of the first wave, having never fully appreciated the extent of the current situation and soon-to-be-realized damage, people are making grand assumptions based on grossly incomplete understandings.  I believe all bets are in fact already off, and investors will be taken by surprise for a third time, waking up to the terror as reality sets in. This wide belief that society can pick up where it left off will prove disappointing. Last Thursday's gap-down open was smart money making their exit and likely made a top that sets up a sudden cascade decline, closely resembling the March top and subsequent decline, for a retest of the March 23 low. Friday also showed heavy stealth selling with odd momentum throughout the day. Dumb money may be dancing without a seat. I'm split on the timing because a lot of false data is being thrown around, from global case and death numbers to employment figures, and exceptionally irrelevant news has driven the market ever higher, giving every reason to expect this to continue. As such, timing this market has been challenging. A market-crushing catalyst hiding in the shadows is anarchy. While the US is certainly facing some, quite a few neighbors south of our border are at risk. Disruptions to food supply and the collapse of medical infrastructure will topple more than one government. This is unlikely before June 19, but highly probable before the end of the year.
