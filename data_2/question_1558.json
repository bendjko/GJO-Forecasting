She just repeatedly stressed, that under no circumstance will she once more apply for a seat in parliament nor being elected chancellor. The need for a re-orientation after 15+ years under Merkel's leadership will remain, more so as general elections are scheduled for 2021. However, discussions and eventualities brought forward now concerning the future personnel could harm the current impression of unity within CDU/CSU, and a constructive quietude.\nUnless she makes bigger mistakes as the party leader or will leave more negative impressions of her work as minister of defence, A. Kramp-Karrenbauer will be confirmed in her position for the sake of peace within the party.\nIt seems the congress had been \"cancelled\" for that date in December in the meantime (or rather put on stand by, I would say), but that @pstamp does not exclude for the next weeks and months, that the same special congress will be re-scheduled to e.g. September when large gatherings with 1,000 participants or more are likely to be admitted again. Circumstances due to the pandemic change fast this year, and it looks as if political processes have started rolling again now.\n I would rather read the last answer as \"No successor will be selected at the special party congress or there will be no special party congress before 1 Jan 2021 happening\".

The background is similar to my post on 21 April:\nhttps://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/1018969\nIt\u00b4s not the first part of that (you\u00b4re right about that contradicting opening football) but the second. As a result of very popular crisis management S\u00f6der (CSU) will most probably be the candidate of CDU and CSU together for German chancellor after Merkel. \n1) The job of party leader of the CDU is only attractive for the candidates, if they have a chance to get chancellor. The candidates with best chances to get elected (Laschet and Merz) would have nothing to gain from \"just being party leader\" without a perspective for more. Much work, little income, little real power. They could only loose.\n2) Current leader Kramp-Karrenbauer is in a much better position now than she was a few months ago, so there is no urgent need to replace her.\n3) As AKK and others announced, the population would not understand a public power struggle in times of crisis. That\u00b4s very true. The mainly left-wing german media would hang them for that. The next regular party congress is scheduled for early December (3rd-5th). A special congress could happen only shortly before that (argument: cancellation of Oktoberfest) so it makes no sense regarding the above mentioned reasons. None of the candidates or the party leadership is even talking about it. It won\u00b4t happen. I think, this question will resolve on 3rd December or earlier as \"special party congress cancelled\". 100% might be too much, of course, your current position is very clever strategically, can be adapted to all changes without having lost much.

Under Merkel the CDU for several reasons in many aspects turned towards left-wing/green politics (they strategically had to, to be precise). Many of the parties voters consider that good, others don\u00b4t (I don\u00b4t!). Merz would lead the party back to a more conservative track. That might get some voters back from AfD, but more could be lost to SPD or the green Party, so in the end it could be bad for overall results in elections. That\u00b4s a relevant strategic point, and even I would consider it more valid than having my personal favourite candidate Merz as the new party leader.
