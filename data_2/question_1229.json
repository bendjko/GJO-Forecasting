Now, the probability of killings follows an inverse power law distribution with an exponent of 2.5. 1) If I use Ubor as a baseline for the period 2011-2019, then there have been two 640+ events in the last 8 years and the probability of a 1000+ massacre will be about 33% that of a 640 one. This yields a 2/8 times 0.33 probability of 1000+ per year: 8.2% 2) If I use Pibor as a baseline, the probability of a 1000+ killing is about 77% of that of a 900 killing. This yiels 1/8 times 0.77 probability of 1000+ per year: 9.6 % 3) The average is 8.9% per year and there are 9.5 months till the dealine, so we end up with a 7% probability.
