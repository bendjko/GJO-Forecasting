I believe that this new rate of positive tests is a result of increased testing from people being tested when going back to school and possibly people being tested when going back to work after the lockdowns ended. Increased testing means increased cases, but with no increase in deaths that means we're not having a real surge. Or maybe any surge that Canada is having is happening in the younger populations such as school age.  since school age children are less vulnerable to Covid than they are to the flu with an R0 less than 1, this should not spread to the rest of the population in any major way. I would expect this increase in testing to be somewhat a temporary thing and should decline somewhat once people are in school and back to work.  Based on this reasoning I do not think the number of daily cases will rise above what it is now and in all likelihood will decline soon. I will adjust if I see daily deaths start to rise. Maybe the deaths are just delayed, but it has been long enough they should have showed up by now. This is a good page to see graphs and tends. Look at daily deaths for Canada.\nhttps://covid19.healthdata.org/canada?view=total-deaths&tab=trend"], [1333, "2020-10-08T18:08:41Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [88098, "2020-10-08T16:37:48Z", [0.05, 0.15, 0.55, 0.25], ""], [87827, "2020-10-08T16:05:39Z", [0.2, 0.4, 0.25, 0.15], "84 days left, currently around 2000 cases a day and climbing. I would guess they peak in the next couple of weeks and then from there it's just a matter of what level they return to. 2000 cases a day would get them around 385k. 1000 a day gets to ~260k. 500 a day (a little above their late summer average) gets to ~215k. I'm guessing somewhere between 1000 a day and 2000 a day, so more weight on 256 to 342. But I'm skewing the distribution right a bit, I've been underestimating the coronavirus spread somewhat since it started so trying to avoid that. https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&country=~CAN&region=World&casesMetric=true&interval=daily&hideControls=true&smoothing=0&pickerMetric=location&pickerSort=asc"], [79591, "2020-10-08T13:57:14Z", [0.65, 0.35, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2020-10-08T12:40:43Z", [0.01, 0.5, 0.47, 0.02], ""], [88452, "2020-10-08T11:15:50Z", [0.0, 0.85, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2020-10-08T10:54:21Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2020-10-08T10:51:56Z", [0.1, 0.15, 0.55, 0.2], ""]], "open_date": "2020-10-08T10:37:17Z", "close_date": "2020-12-08T23:00:22Z"}
