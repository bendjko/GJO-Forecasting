One thing that was very apparant, was that the rate of mean reversion drastically altered results. For example, using a high rate of mean reversion,we almost guarantee that the yield will remain around 1.37 - the mean during the time period in my question. Using a mean reversion rate of 0, yield a wide range of results. Using a variety of mean reversion parameters, the distribution for outcomes is as follows: Less than 1.2%: ~10%\nBw 1.2 and 1.4: ~55%\nBw 1.4 and 1.6: ~35%\nBw 1.6 and 1.8: ~1% Since I have no prior on the rate of mean reversion for US Treasury yields, I use my quantitative results combined with some qualitative insight to arrive at my final distribution. Specifically, last week at Jackson Hole, Powell strongly indicated that he intends to keep interest rates low in the near term as the Fed will target average inflation.

Unfortunately, it is quite challenging to use any typical interest rate factor model (e.g. Vasicek, Hull-White, CIR, Black-Karasinski) as, due to the pandemic, interest rates have turned very volatile and prone to the underlying assumptions. Therefore, we rather look at past sentiments in different market times and the implied Treasury yield to understand how investors price this Treasury in different situations. Setting the 1.4% as threshold, we see that markets are comfortably below 1.4% on some negative news and get above 1.4% on positive news. Since the Jackson Hole meeting, the Fed has given quite a lot of clarity into the future interest rate environment and market has been pricing this in by generally increasing the yield. Adjustments:\nFed meeting:\nThere will be another Fed meeting on September 16, however unless there is a major catalyst, there should be no major surprise from the Fed and they will reiterate their policy. Conclusion: there is no convincing argument for either bucket (1.2-1.4 and 1.4-1.6) yet, therefore we would generally give equal probability to both. However, yields have increased in general lately, thus we attribute slightly more probability to the later bucket."], [95395, "2020-09-07T00:11:03Z", [0.03, 0.21, 0.44, 0.17, 0.15], ""], [95306, "2020-09-06T22:24:21Z", [0.04, 0.31, 0.45, 0.2, 0.0], ""], [95397, "2020-09-06T21:18:12Z", [0.02, 0.45, 0.49, 0.04, 0.0], ""], [95333, "2020-09-06T21:04:35Z", [0.01, 0.43, 0.52, 0.04, 0.0], "Fixed some code errors in simulation"], [95331, "2020-09-06T20:16:05Z", [0.02, 0.3, 0.53, 0.14, 0.01], ""], [1333, "2020-09-06T19:46:24Z", [0.05, 0.5, 0.35, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [95333, "2020-09-06T19:44:49Z", [0.01, 0.51, 0.45, 0.03, 0.0], "Reran Monte Carlo simulation with new data, and using 3 months of historical data rather than 1 year.
