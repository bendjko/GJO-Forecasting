It appears from the infrequent Montana polls that the best Daines has ever done in the polling is tie with Bullock.  Moreover, there are fewer polls for the senate than the presidential races in 2020. However, they seem to show that Bullock has always been popular.  He even beat Trump in an October 8, 2019, hypothetical presidential poll against Trump by four points.    Biden also appears to be narrowing the gap against Trump. The economy is bad, which will hurt all Republicans.  However, the economy should be in a slow recovery by November, which will lessen the damage to the Republicans, but by how much?   Montana might not be as Republican as I first thought when looking at this question.  The other US Senator and the Governor (Steve Bullock, now senate candidate) are both Democrats.   Bullock won his first governorship by a hair,  48.90/47.34, and his second governorship by 50.25/46.35, in a year the democrats were trounced by the Republicans.    Daines did win the 2014 election 57/40, but he has also tied himself to Trump, which I suspect will hurt him greatly.   The only approval poll I found for both was dated January 19th, 2019.  Both candidates where popular but Bullock was more popular among in his own party and among independents.  Bullock was also less unpopular in the Republican party than Daines in the Democratic party.  All in all,  I think the popular Democrat right now has the lead.  https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/montana/\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Daines#2014_election\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_Senate_election_in_Montana#Polling\nhttps://www.montana.edu/news/18346/bullock-daines-have-most-favorable-ratings-in-new-msu-mtn-post-election-poll"], [86472, "2020-05-27T21:31:42Z", [0.6, 0.4, 0.0], "I feel the incumbent Governor going for Senate will have better success than the incumbent Senator (use FL's last senate race as an example for the success of the Governor).
