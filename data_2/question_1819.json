Additionally, these nations are last in line to receive the vaccine, which will leave their rates of infection climbing ever higher.[1] Consequently, I predict that there is a 100% chance that 9 or more nations will have 100,000 or more deaths attributed to COVID-19 as of April 30th.

Updating from 0/0/0/97/3. It will be 8 countries: US, Brazil, Mexico, India, UK, Italy, Russia, France. They're all already there, and for any other countries to break 100k we'd need one of those retroactive updates, where a big pile of data is suddenly dumped onto the system. Trouble is, the size of the update would have to be 5-10x larger than any such dumps that have occurred in the past. In all cases except Germany and Spain (less likely to have such dumps), the backlog would have to be 50% or more of ALL deaths so far. Plus it would have to happen in the next 11 days. I've done pretty well in this question overall. I don't want to brag (although who can resist a little bit of it?), but rather point out how simple were the heuristics I used to get a very good forecast all the way back in Dec 2020. (You can see it in [1].) On 20 Dec 2020, when I made my first forecast, the crowd was about evenly split between \"4\" and \"5 or 6\", with almost no weight given to higher buckets. In contrast, my own forecast gave \"8\" the highest weight. (I forecast each individual outcome, not just the question buckets.) I had \"8\" at 35%, as well as \"7\" and \"9\" at around 25% each. Moreover, I gave a probability to each individual country; and every country I gave >50% reached 100k, whereas no country I gave <50% did so. Even better, countries reached 100k roughly in the order of the probabilities I assigned them. E.g. I gave Italy and UK 90%, and they reached 100k long before Russia, which I gave 70% to. And Russia reached 100k three weeks before France, which I gave 60% to. And France, which I gave 60%, reached 100k today, very close to the deadline. Finally, the next highest for me was Germany at 40%, and of all countries which didn't cross 100k, Germany came closest. So overall I feel that in this question I was very well calibrated. No doubt some of this success is \"luck\". But probably not all of it. The only clear edge that I can see myself having over most is that I actually bothered to give each country its own individual probability, then I wrote a simple program to get the aggregate forecast. With 10+ countries in play you can't really do it by hand or by eyeballing. For the individual probabilities I just looked at where each country was, and how fast it was growing; occasionally I checked on Google which were doing lockdowns; and I made sure countries farther ahead and growing faster had higher odds than countries farther behind and growing slower. That's it. I know little about the politics or news of any country except US and Brazil (which were already over 100k when I started this Q).

Are they only now recording the \"backlog\" of 186k that the govt admitted to some months ago? Anyway, under 8k to go now, difficult to imagine they don't go over. Eta 2 April.\nFrance: 70%, down from 75%. Weekly deaths declining since late Jan, but cases are slightly rising since then. That suggests that weekly deaths are unlikely to decline much further, and at the current rate they make it. Eta 23 April.\nGermany: 10%, down from 20%. Their cases seem to be rising again but we are running out of time. Also, their cases have only a tenuous connection to deaths, as I'm told their testing policies change a lot. Eta 19 July. Spain: 1%, down from 10%, as their 4th (?) wave is over, there is not enough time for a 5th wave, and even if it was as big as the 4th it wouldn't put us over 100k. Eta 21 September. Weekly rate is from www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/spain\nColombia: 1%, down from 5%, as new cases are down 10x from peak, and would need to 10x up in the next week to make the deadline.

Depending on how they count deaths, that could impact.\nFrance is holding steady and I expect the current death rate (~400 per day) to hold through February. However they only need to average under 265 per day over the full period to come under 100,000 deaths. Over the remaining 60 days of the time period that would be 223 deaths per day. Their vaccine roll out has been slow (and frankly strange at times), but they have a good chance of having low death rates in mid-late March through April. Their cases counts are not encouraging however. Requirement for weekly count at 1st March: 1800.\nGermany should avoid the 100,000. They are currently at ~640 deaths per day and need to average 466 per day for the entire period. On current pace Germany will be at 460 deaths per day in another ~3 weeks. Even assuming a bad February, they should be able to manage to drop below the 460 deaths per day mark by the start of March. I will be looking at the weekly figure for 1st March with interest. If it is below 3,220 then \"9 or more\" will become very unlikely. Cases also dropping.\nRussia is most likely of the three to break the 100,000 barrier. It has recorded ~500 deaths per day for the past 7 days. It needs to average below 285 per day for the next 83 days to fail to break 100,000. The recent week on week decrease is significant and encouraging, but of course one cannot extrapolate too much from a single weekly count. it is less distinct in the daily figures, for instance. However the case rates are falling ahead of the deaths! Their vaccines seem decent and we should expect improvement.

However, Spain appears to have just had a spike in cases and is on its way back down, so I think Spain is very unlikely of passing 100k by the question end. Italy looks guaranteed to exceed. So the big question is whether France, Russia, or Germany exceed and put this in the 7 or 8 category. They would both need to average less than 270 deaths a day for the remainder of the time to not exceed 100k. That seems pretty unlikely, especially considering the slow pace of the vaccine rollout in these countries. Germany is currently around 700 deaths a day and would need to average below 480 deaths per day for the remainder to stay under 100k. I think this is very possible for Germany, they recently had a spike in cases and deaths and cases seem to be on the way back down, so deaths should be too soon.

Last time deaths were rising fast, but now cases started leveling off. 45k to go\nSpain: 15%, eta 30 June 2021. Cases have started rising recently. Data unreliable. 40k to go.\nSouth Africa: 10%, eta 22 June 2021. Last time deaths were rising fast, but then started falling just as fast. 55k to go\nIran: 5%, eta 31 July 2022. The window for them to release believable numbers is rapidly closing.\nSurprise country: 10%, will go down to 5% in a month probably, if none appear.

That might seem reasonable except vaccines are coming out and will go early to the most vulnerable. Given that, I don't see how a European country will reach 100k deaths  before May.  3) Iran. I don't know what the vaccination story is there. Looking at the chart, their current infection wave is falling fast. There may be another wave, but they would need to double the current death count by May, which seems unlikely, but maybe there's a 10% chance. (They would need 348 deaths per day and are currently at 213 a day.) 4) Russia. I'm confused by stories about the Sputnik vaccine. There are recent claims it is 91% effective, but according the Wikipedia \"The age for those receiving shots is capped at 60.\"[1]  What the heck? No explanation for this is given in the Reuters article. There is also another vaccine candidate in Russia which could be released soon.

They could very possibly drop well below 300 a day after this wave, but it's hard to say what will happen.

This is based on the UK's premature abandonment of lockdown, slow rate of reduction of the hospitalization rate, and the fact that daily deaths tend to decrease more slowly on the way down than up, plus the seasons are working against us. With Italy it is based those last 2 points and the height of its current peak, which is only just peaking now, and is just below where it was during the second wave. France could do so on a third wave (or indeed the UK or Italy, if they don't on the second wave), and there is always the possibility that Iran will correct their covered-up data (or indeed they may pass 100k even without that). What is hard to account for is the effect of vaccines. But since these are 2-shot vaccines separated by a 4 week waiting period, and the UK will probably not start vaccinating until next week, and Italy not until January, it would seem that the effect these will have on the death toll of the second wave will be minimal. However we should also consider that while only 2 shots of the vaccine is likely to be enough for 90%+ people to get immunity, it is possible that receiving just the first shot alone (and then getting infected sometime in the following 4 weeks) will be enough to avoid severe symptoms of covid. The UK expects 10m vaccine doses in December, if these are given to the 10m most vulnerable people as 1-shot vaccines (to be followed up with the second dose in January when more vaccine come in), then it is plausible that this could indeed have a significant effect on the total death count.

Italy have much fewer cases than France and Spain by comparison and so I think their winter deaths may be much less severe so believe it's unlikely they will. France have recently called a second National lockdown so they may have the virus under control again over the winter months so more unlikely.\n"], [96559, "2020-10-28T22:34:08Z", [0.01, 0.32, 0.58, 0.08, 0.01], "The bulk of the chances sit between 4 and 6 countries. We are very likely to see 100k from Mexico. The question becomes from the surging countries that could hit the mark in 187 days as of this writing. UK, Argentina, Iran, and possibly Peru or Colombia. The UK showed a high death to case ratio early in the outbreak, but clearly normalized. So given the new spike in cases, its questionable that the fatality rate will follow in step. If we make a rough estimate that around 4 million cases is needed to get 100k deaths, the question becomes whether UK will 4.6x cases in 187 days. Given the controls and better understanding today, the odds feel low. Argentina has recently hit 1MM cases, and the path to 4MM seems like it will likely miss the target date. Comparing it to Brazil which took 87 days to move to get to 1MM cases, while Argentina took 202 days. Their pace is 2.3x slower. Expanding to 4MM took brazil 73 days, so making the relative comparison would put Argentina at ~168 days to hit 4MM. Given that it feels we are seeing worldwide decrease in fatality rate it leans toward to NOT reaching 100k deaths for the target date.
