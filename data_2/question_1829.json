These tests coincided with a change in US political leadership and an increase in rhetoric and tensions. The following years were marked by US diplomatic engagement with North Korea, notably two summits between the leaders. During this time, all missile tests were limited to short-range projectiles. The emergence of a potential Hwasong-15 successor during a military parade in October can be seen as benefiting the North Korean regime in two ways. First, it may bolster/reinforce NK domestic military-political considerations. Second, debuting the missile at a time when the US Presidential election polling showed a potential change in leader enables NK to \"reset the clock\" to 2017 to begin a new period of engagement through provocation. This missile's debut appears to follow a similar playbook to 2016, which had two attempted launches of longer-ranged missiles during the final month of the US election, followed by no notable activity until February 2017 with the new administration was in office. There is little NK can gain by heightening tensions with a potential lame-duck administration or with the successor but can be seen as a way for NK policy to remain at the forefront of US foreign policy.
