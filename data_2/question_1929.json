He had also initially refused to give permission for Navalny to be evacuated to a clinic in Berlin for treatment, a transfer that was eventually authorised by Vladimir Putin. The impasse led to a tense standoff at Omsk\u2019s emergency hospital No 1, where close aides to Navalny said that Russian hospital officials were trying to delay tests that would show Navalny had been poisoned.

(I'm not counting the 93 constitutional crises). [1] [2] Therefore our 'base rate' (ignoring the current heightened tension) has to be quite low - in approx. 30 years, this event has not occurred once, so we'd put an annual probability <3%. We can't really reference a longer time horizon in Russia due to the significant changes in the country (Soviet Unicon => Russian Fed etc.) But another reference point, in the UK, a country that has had a similar political environment for >100 years, I'm not sure if we've had 5 or more fatalities from an anti-government protest in the last 100 years. i.e. base rate UK <1%. Obviously UK and Russia have completely different philosophies to policing and protest, so I wouldn't just naively apply UK's rate either. We're going to have to make judgement here, so let's make a pick of 1.5% for our annual base rate in Russia.  For the approx. 6 months left in the timeframe for the question, that gives us a base line probability of about 0.75%. Let's then add to this the a specific 'event' in respect of Navalny. I think we're going to need a few events to all line up in order for their to be >5 fatalities:\n1) Navalny dies within the above time frame (assigned 66% chance)\n2) Large protests emerge as a result (99% chance)\n3) 5 or more fatalities occur as a result of these protests (5% chance) The 5% chance in the third step is based on their being at least 10 'significant' protests in Russia in recent years (see links at bottom), none of which lead to 5 or more fatalities, so I really don;t think this prob can be assigned to be too high. Multiplying out 1-3 gives overall prob of approx. 3.3% of >5 fatalities from Navalny protests\nAdding this to our baseline of 0.75% of other protests gives an overall probability of 4%.

Their training and planning allowed them to inflict terrible beatings while not killing anyone as they systematically locked down the block where the riot was happening.

Current protests seem to be of a similar scale to previous protests, but with much greater violence and the number of injuries and arrests per protestor (almost an order of magnitude higher). This seems to imply a higher likelihood of deaths during protests. Similar protests over the summer in the United States and during the certification of the election results in 2020 and 2021 led to approximately 30 deaths for reference. The current set of protests is also focused at the government's failure to allow parties unaligned with Putin to stand in elections, as opposed to requests for better social conditions as in 2018. Thus, the higher propensity for violence coupled with the more existential nature of the threat to the Putin Regime and the United Russia party implies a much greater likelihood for casualties and deaths.
