As usual the first thing to do is to look at base rates, which I did not do myself. A second constraint is of course the Chinese government: the first update of the list of no-export technologies in 12 years just happened when the Tiktok deal seemed to be approaching. This indicates a certain probability that the Chinese gov simply want to avoid the sale of Tiktop. If I use \"phase space approximation\" (i.e. a physicists term to indicate that I equally distribute the probability between all the possibilities, in this case \"yes\" or \"no\"), this gives me a 50% chance that the deal will never be approved. This in turn could be compatible with the discussion that is going on in the Chinese internet, in which there seems to be a tendency towards \"\u4e0d\u80fd\u5356\" (cannot be sold). Another reason to increase the probability of a \"no\", at least a temporary one, is that the Chinese gov is likely to be waiting to what happens in the US elections. They might have the hope that if Biden wins, the situation could change: Tiktok could be used again in the US, still in the hands of Bytedance, and all these sweet user data of American users at the disposition of the CCP at the moment they want. So why rush if there is this possibility? But even if we are in the timeline in which the Chinese gov will allow Titkok to be sold, the approval requires at least 30 days, probably more. The wording of the question is whether a deal would be announced, and the deal could indeed be announced before the approval of the Chinese gov (and later maybe recanted if things go south?), but this does not look the most sensible thing to do."], [95233, "2020-09-06T01:04:50Z", [0.2, 0.8, 0.0], ""], [95325, "2020-09-06T00:08:03Z", [0.03, 0.32, 0.65], "after a lengthy convo with @RSparkes, readjusting forecast.

To occur before 09/16 would require negotiating Chinese approval within 2.5 weeks, or for Microsoft + Walmart to negotiate a deal that doesn't involve purchasing the algorithm within 2.5 weeks. Either seems very unlikely. Similarly, deal occurring by November is unlikely- Trump is unlikely to enforce deadline due to election uncertainty; also Microsoft would push for a deal at earliest date.

Finally, I multiply out the conditional probabilities. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tiktok-china/chinas-new-tech-export-controls-could-give-beijing-a-say-in-tiktok-sale-idUSKBN25Q05Q\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-walmart-oracle-buy-tiktok-bytedance-future-app-changes-analysis-2020-9\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tiktok-bytedance-exclusive/exclusive-aspiring-tiktok-buyers-pursue-four-options-in-effort-to-revive-talks-sources-idUSKBN25T2IG\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktok-deal-talks-are-snarled-over-fate-of-apps-algorithms-11598995674"], [95275, "2020-09-06T00:06:26Z", [0.04, 0.15, 0.81], ""], [28899, "2020-09-05T23:21:00Z", [0.02, 0.03, 0.95], ""], [28899, "2020-09-05T23:11:57Z", [0.11, 0.02, 0.87], ""], [1333, "2020-09-05T21:59:53Z", [0.3, 0.35, 0.35], ""], [95361, "2020-09-05T20:22:48Z", [0.22, 0.25, 0.53], ""], [86658, "2020-09-05T14:12:57Z", [0.53, 0.27, 0.2], ""], [13306, "2020-09-05T13:41:15Z", [0.07, 0.09, 0.84], ""], [60948, "2020-09-05T12:12:00Z", [0.1, 0.1, 0.8], ""], [19127, "2020-09-05T11:19:39Z", [0.09, 0.12, 0.79], ""], [56, "2020-09-05T06:20:23Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.9], ""], [95335, "2020-09-05T03:54:32Z", [0.26, 0.09, 0.65], "Like My colleagues, we can simplify this problem into event spaces.\nThe first is Event(A) = Microsoft does not announce deal before November 1. I view this option as the same as if Microsoft not announcing a deal at all. In a recent news, China has implemented new export restrictions that potentially can block or delay any deal for ByteDance to sell operations to the US.  Further, the US elections is on November 2nd, and if President Trump does not win, the pressure for ByteDance to sell TikTok may dissipate. I also believe that if ByteDance sells TikTok before November 1st, it will come across as if sold only because Trump forced them too, a weak image for Chinese tech stocks that China would likely not want to display.  Next is Event(B), Microsoft does announce deal. In this event space, either MSFT announces before September 16th or between September 16th and October 31st.  We know from statements made on Aug 2nd by MSFT, they stated that they will make a decision by September 15th in any event. Further, it is now known that Microsoft has teamed up with Walmart and Oracle indicating that they are still strongly considering a TikTok purchase.  It is difficult to empirically quantify the probability in each event space, so heuristically I will assign the following; I believe it is unlikely a deal will be announced by MSFT before November 1st, so I assign this a 65% probability. In the remaining 35%, I believe strongly that is MSFT were to make a deal for TikTok, it would happen at their originally stated deadline, Sept 15th. Let\u2019s call the probability that MSFT announces a deal before Sept 15th, P(X|B), where B is the event space B defined above, and I assign this a probability of 75%. Likewise, let P(Y|B) be event space Y where Y represents MSFT announcing the deal between Sept 16th and Oct 31st. P(Y|B) will be assigned a probability of 0.25%. I give some probability to this event happening because it is possible that the original statements made my MSFT were contingent on the White House\u2019s  initial deadline of Sept 20th, which has now been pushed back. From the above we see that:\nP(Not Before Nov 1st) = 0.65\nP(Between Sept 16th and Nov 1st) = P(Y|B)*P(B) = 0.25*0.35 = 0.0875\nP(Before Sept 16th) = P(X|B) *P(B) = 0.75*0.35 = 0.27\nI round up the middle bucket to make up my weights. \n"], [95325, "2020-09-05T01:09:09Z", [0.1, 0.3, 0.6], ""], [95395, "2020-09-04T22:17:36Z", [0.4, 0.1, 0.5], ""], [95401, "2020-09-04T21:51:37Z", [0.45, 0.1, 0.45], "Two components, timing and acquirer:  Trump has set a 9/20th deadline at first.

Therefore, to come up with a distribution for the announcement date, we used a more situation dependent approach. Official deadlines:\nMicrosoft deadline: As pointed out by @pchi, Microsoft made it clear in an announcement on August 2 that they will make a decision \"in any event event no later than September 15\".\nUS administration deadline: The current US administration will restrict US companies transacting with ByteDance by September 20, with a deal completion extended to happen by November 12. Other participants:\nCompetitors: The question asks about Microsoft announcing the deal, however, there are only other companies interested in the acquisition. Main contenders include Oracle, Twitter, Walmart, Facebook. These companies also have cash flow and balance sheet positions that would allow the (current) $20B purchase price. Furthermore, Oracle is also considering sweetening the deal for current ByteDance owners by offering participations in company profits for the next 2 years.\nChinese government: Two days ago the Chinese government also raised its voice and pointed out that the IP is Chinese, thus they will also need to approve the transaction. This just complicates the US-China relations further and may be the main reason none of the contenders have announced a deal yet. Therefore, in conclusion market seems to imply a 35% chance that Microsoft will not be the company to announce the deal. We furthermore weight that for the rest there is a 10% chance (in total 6%) of the deadlines being pushed further out and/or deal falling apart. However, the deadlines are unlikely to go out more than October 31, given that US elections are on November 3 and China is one of the current administration's target for convincing voters. The September 15 deadline by Microsoft was set a month ago and a lot has changed ever since. Therefore, it is not improbable that they will be also more lenient on their internally set deadline. "], [95369, "2020-09-04T03:35:41Z", [0.15, 0.25, 0.6], "I broke down this question into two sub-questions: 1) Will Microsoft be the one who acquired Tik Tok, and 2) if 1) is true, when the announcement will be. Up until 9/3/2020, Trump has announced that Tik Tok now has an extra 45 days to complete the acquisition on or before 11/15/2020, China has put additional protective measures on Tik Tok's core algorithm, and Oracle/Softbank are joining the bidding war.  Considering this kind of forced acquisition is fairly unprecedented, I decide to bring more inside view than outside view when analyzing this question. Even though Microsoft is a strong buyer, Softbank has a lot of capital to potentially outbid Microsft, and Oracle is willing to buy Tik Tok for half of its cash flow, I will assign 50% probability to Microsoft winning the bill. On the other hand, I assign the probability of China willing to let Tik Tok go/Tik Tok willing to sell to be 40% because both of them have shown evidence to fight back on the forced sale (China's announcement on its potential regulations on Tik Tok's core algo and Tik Tok's law suit against Trump administration). It is to Tik Tok and China's benefit to drag the acquisition longer.  Thus, the first scenario happens when the acquirer is Microsoft + China gives Microsoft a go before September 16. Because of the recent escalation discussed before, I will adjust the latter probability from the 0.4 baseline to 0.3. The total probability is 0.5 * 0.3 =   0.15.\n\nThe second scenario happens when the acquirer is Microsoft + China gives Microsoft a go between September 16 and October 31.  The total probability is 0.5 * 0.5 =   0.25. My last scenario is deal not happening at all/the deal drags along/the acquirer is not Microsoft, which has a 60% probability. "], [95347, "2020-09-04T03:09:32Z", [0.1, 0.36, 0.54], "Because this is such an unpredictable question, I had to make some assumptions. The first was that Microsoft/Walmart and Oracle, the two most likely groups to acquire Tik Tok, are interchangeable. I assumed that since the first group has two major players, it has a 2/3 chance to receive the deal, conditional on a deal occurring. I decided to break up the problem into two events, which I treated as independent. Event A: The group attempting to acquire TikTok would be willing to accept a deal without TikTok's proprietary algorithm. I gave this the most naive probability possible, P(A)=0.5 Event B: Beijing will ultimately be willing to approve of an acquisition deal which includes the algorithm. Despite the recent tariff expansion, I wanted to leave out any kind of bias and also give this event P(B)=0.5 Let D be the event that a deal is made before the November 14 deadline that the acquisition has been given. By the law of total probability and the independence of A and B we have\nP(D) = P(D|A,B)P(B) + P(D|A, not B)P(not B) + P(Deal|not A, B)P(B) + P(Deal|not A, not B)P(not B)\nIf A and B occur, then there is a higher chance of the deal occurring. Beijing would be willing to give up the algorithm and the buyer would be willing to make a deal without it, so there's more flexibility on both sides. However the deal could take until the November 14 deadline, and a deal this size always has the chance to fall through, so I set P(D|A,B)=0.75. If A occurs but B does not then a deal will come through if there aren't any more legal obstacles from Beijing's side blocking a deal without the algorithm. Combined with other things that could go wrong, I give P(D|A, not B)=0.50. If B occurs but not A, then by similar logic, I give P(D|B, not A)=0.50. One side is less flexible and things could go wrong in a variety of ways preventing a deal by November 14. Finally, if neither A nor B occurs, then a deal is unlikely. Beijing will not allow the sale of the algorithm, and the US counterpart will not accept a deal without it. So I assign P(D|not A, not B)=0. Altogether this gives us\nP(D) = 0.75*0.5 + 0.5*0.5 + 0.5*0.5 + 0*0.5 = 0.875\nand since Microsoft/Walmart has a 2/3 probability of being the US entity to acquire TikTok, this puts the probability of Microsoft/Walmart announcing TikTok before November 14 at 0.5775. Therefore we have an upper bound on the probability of an announcement at 0.5775. The crux of the problem is how much of this probability to assign to each period. If we did this in proportion with the length of each period we would end up with Before 16 September: (12/72) * 0.5775 = .09625\nBetween 16 September and 31 October: (45/72) * 0.5775 = .3609375\nBetween 31 October and 14 November: (15/72) * 0.5775 = .1203125 Frankly I do not think I have enough knowledge about these kinds of acquisitions to use any metric which is not linear with time.

Of course it is still possible for these dates to change.  Looking at current analyst opinions it also seems that opinions vary quite widely. Some have been confident saying the chance of a deal (in early Aug.) was 75-80% while others are much more conservative giving odds of 20%.

Trump's stated deadline is 12Nov, which is strongly pushing probability towards a deal occurring. However, we also consider that China's government has stated it must review the deal, and their antagonistic stance towards Trump. Thus, we can estimate an 65% chance that a deal occurs before 1Nov, regardless of buyer. The above process gives a 61% chance that MSFT is not involved in a deal before 1Nov Assuming MSFT actually wins deal, and it occurs before 1 Nov, need to consider probability of it taking place before 16 Sep.

This seems like a reasonable justification for moving some probability from option #1 to #2. A Microsoft deal was probably imminent, but has now been pushed back several weeks. But then... \n2.

Another option is, Mayer has not acted in the best interest of the company, e.g. not achieving a price target, delivering arguments for lowering the price, co-operating somehow too closely with US regulators (e.g. sharing inside views and first hand knowledge in order to save his own skin).

I just don't know, but a CEO quitting in the middle of a storm is not a good sign in general - for the company. http://www.businessworld.in/article/TikTok-CEO-Mayer-Quits-After-Three-Months-Just-As-Firm-Challenges-US-Ban/27-08-2020-313673/"], [95202, "2020-08-27T06:10:35Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [34959, "2020-08-27T05:31:05Z", [0.01, 0.06, 0.93], ""], [88497, "2020-08-27T05:16:36Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [13306, "2020-08-27T03:00:37Z", [0.0, 0.02, 0.98], ""], [19127, "2020-08-27T01:50:00Z", [0.04, 0.12, 0.84], ""], [75794, "2020-08-26T20:58:20Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [691, "2020-08-26T19:57:12Z", [0.01, 0.05, 0.94], ""], [89038, "2020-08-26T19:12:40Z", [0.02, 0.09, 0.89], ""], [1333, "2020-08-26T17:02:37Z", [0.05, 0.4, 0.55], ""], [88010, "2020-08-26T14:54:18Z", [0.01, 0.01, 0.98], ""], [88766, "2020-08-26T11:28:20Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [13306, "2020-08-26T05:28:33Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [87192, "2020-08-25T22:22:24Z", [0.15, 0.85, 0.0], ""], [27661, "2020-08-25T20:01:27Z", [0.01, 0.04, 0.95], ""], [91134, "2020-08-25T19:55:39Z", [0.25, 0.65, 0.1], "Presidential deadline is motivating but not a true drop dead date, and only meant as motivation.

Microsoft is looking to expand the business landscape in social media (SM) platforms. So TikTok is the steady growing SM platform; for that reason, the acquisition will be a reasonable move for MS.  We should remember Facebook and Whatsapp acquisition's characteristics.  Tiktok side; 7th largest SM platforms, and worldwide 800M monthly active users (source: Datareportal, Jul 2020). The acquisition is an excellent opportunity to stretch the barriers in many countries!  In the user/market, according to Alexa's Internet traffic analysis, 32% of Tiktok's traffic comes from the US in July 2020. With the 800M monthly worldwide active user platform is a significant market. From the government's point of view,  national security concerns about Tiktok acquisition is crucial.  On the other hand, the rising of contrast messages about President Trump on the social media platforms and president's negative approaches to the social media platforms in his messages with the 2020 US presidential election concerns are escalating the issue.  After the election, this deal will be high likely closed if all technical and business requirements will be done.

They have already lost India (the market that really matters), yet Microsoft might be well placed to take this area too, making it a substantial marketshare if they took N. America plus a few other territories in advance. I also think Microsoft has the real pull/reach to ensure all areas win (\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3$$$) behind the scenes despite any angst coming from China and US officials on the surface, during and post-deal. https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/08/02/microsoft-to-continue-discussions-on-potential-tiktok-purchase-in-the-united-states/"], [8826, "2020-08-10T16:24:29Z", [0.8, 0.15, 0.05], ""], [89013, "2020-08-10T16:11:58Z", [0.12, 0.03, 0.85], ""], [88284, "2020-08-10T15:42:26Z", [0.1, 0.1, 0.8], ""], [90167, "2020-08-10T14:41:20Z", [0.36, 0.14, 0.5], ""], [34959, "2020-08-10T14:25:31Z", [0.61, 0.1, 0.29], ""], [80540, "2020-08-10T13:57:51Z", [0.7, 0.25, 0.05], ""], [86658, "2020-08-10T10:41:55Z", [0.35, 0.47, 0.18], ""], [94370, "2020-08-10T10:34:20Z", [0.55, 0.35, 0.1], ""], [93502, "2020-08-10T10:11:16Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.9], "Trump putting forward a condition to the deal (that the Fed must get a cut from it), makes landing such a deal very complicated:\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/business-53633315\nAlso, Gates expressed his wariness on this deal, calling it a \"poisoned chalice\":\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2020/8/8/21359720/bill-gates-microsoft-tik-tok-deal-comments-interview\nFinally, when a major M&A deal is in the public spotlight before it is anywhere close to being agreed, it typically fails (or more-ften-than-not, it's never meant to be closed, but only meant to be a news distraction and/or a political posturing, rather than really intended to be a real deal).\nAlso I personally don't see the actual commercial value of a TikTok deal for Microsoft (TikTok is a fad, which exactly like Snapchat will evaporate before you say \"TikTok\", for reasons starting with \"its user base has peaked already\" to \"replacement apps by better positioned players such as Instagram, Triller etc. have already started emerging\"), but it's not just me, see article in Forbes about the non-sensical commercial justification for this deal:\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/bobbyowsinski/2020/08/09/microsoft-buying-tiktok/ For the above reasons, I am highly skeptical of this deal ever having been intended to become 'real', as opposed to just a distraction.

Perhaps they let Trump institute the ban on the application he is currently threatening to gain better pricing or other concessions.\nThoughts: I am not sure what the likelihood is that Trump would actually follow through on the ban. It seems like a good way to provoke a popular backlash for little gain to his camp. My assessment is that that threat of the ban is giving microsoft some leverage in the acquisition, so they will want to move forward swiftly before Trump fails to follow through. There are also factors that would incentivize Miscrosoft to want to keep the application in operation (and have not gaps due to the ban), although I can see factors that would incentive the opposite action as well so that Microsoft could announce the application's triumphant return.

It's mainly about content creation, but Tiktok is also delivering a stock pile of images used in AI/machine learning, face recognition, 3D sensoring of rooms and spaces etc. \n/There will be a due diligence process ahead of an acquisition, which will take at least 30 days, to support the price finding.\n/Together, it'll prevent the acquisition from happening before 01 September 2020.\nI would estimate the value of the business at 50bn USD, which would be one of the biggest acquisitions in Microsoft's history; with regards to US tech giants' liquidity at hand, it still seems affordable without constraints of too much debt involved.\n/As this is a political issue, almost surely the T. campaign will frequently use Tiktok as an example of the incumbent being allegedly tough on China during rallies ahead of November 3rd. Therefore, any settlement before 15 October 2020 would be \"lost political capital\" to POTUS.\n/If I see this correctly, the 45-days-period of the presidential order will end around 20 September.

(2) It suggests that the President intends to ban the app if the deal were not to go through, meaning ByteDance would lose a huge amount of money if they don't sell.
