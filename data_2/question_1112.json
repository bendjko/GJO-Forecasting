Time magazine had an interesting article on predicting this.  According to their algorithm, 3 main pieces of info can be useful to providing a good guesstimate here:  1. was the film also nominated for Best Director?  2. was it also nominated for best editing?  3. did it win top honors from the Director's Guild of America (announced before Oscars)? Romo meets criteria #1 and #3 listed above.  According to the article, the Dir's Guild award can greatly enhance the odds of winning.  The second criteria, which Roma did not meet, has a strong correlation to winning Best Pic.  The article mentions that the algorithm used does not take into account Hollywood internal politics and bias.  Working against Roma is the fact that the industry may not want to see a Netflix film win this award.   My second choice to win is Spike Lee's BlacKKKlansman.  I really enjoyed this movie, and feel this may be Spike's chance to win, much like Martin Scorsese finally got his deserved victory with The Departed. This film also meets criteria #1 and #3 above, but not #2. Working against this film, is the many enemies Spike likely has in Hollywood - politics in play again. My sentimental favorite is Black Panther, but I just don't see a Marvel film getting the nod.  I know Vice and The Favorite, also are strong contenders (and they meet criteria #1 and #3), however I just don't know too much about them. http://time.com/5533849/oscars-academy-awards-prediction-best-picture/"], [40272, "2019-02-24T21:08:02Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [37236, "2019-02-24T16:38:14Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0], "To undercut its chances as a \"contender\" The Green Book has been vilified by the worst forms of mendacity and effete critques by pundits and academics who follow culture and cinema.
