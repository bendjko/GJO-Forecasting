Yet, the average first day pop from 2010 to 2020 has been 18 percent according to the nasdaq article below.  Moreover, the pop is greater for popular IPOs, large IPOs and tech IPOs.  Also, the pop is larger if the market has increase by at least 2.5 percent in the last three weeks.  The S&P 500 and nasdaq 100 have beaten that.   The new IPO date seems to be November 10th.  The relationship to Amazon (20 percent owner) and Ford (5 percent) should produce a lot of interest as well.  It is sort of a seal of approval from blue chip companies that know high tech and have a long history of successful car manufacturing.  Also, the fewer the shares that are offered (\"floated\"), the higher the valuation at the end of the day.  17.6 percent of all Rivian stock is being floated in this IPO.  I really do not know if that is considered a small or large offering, even though it sounds small to me.  On the down side, one-third of IPO end up below their opening price.    Why did Rivian lower the IPO from $80B to $53B?  This seems to be key.    It could be the underwriters realized the market believed the IPO was greatly over-priced as stated in the Forbes article below.   I cannot think of any other \"good\" reason.   So, lets start with $53B * 1.18 = $62.54 billion.   Add in the positives and adjust the 18 percent upward as initial outside view.    All of the positive above suggests it could go up to 100 percent or $106 billion as a max.  It could also be cut way down. The Forbes article, which seems very well reasoned, suggested no more that $13B is the real value of Rivian.   At worst, I doubt the company would fall by more than 50 percent.  So the min is $26.5B. Putting this all together (which I am lousy at).   The 90 percent interval is probably $26.5B to $106B.  Halfway would be $66.2B.   Since I get $68B and $66.2B with what I suspect is a wide standard deviation, lets say 15B,  my best guess is high $83B and low $52B.  If I had more time for this question, I would go through all the IPO mentioned in the article posted by @DNK89, categorize the companies and then compute a mean and standard deviation.   I think this would reduce the undertainty even more. https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/trends-in-ipo-pops-2021-03-04\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2021/11/04/even-at-a-lowered-valuation-dont-buy-rivians-ipo/?sh=23cfb830d125\nhttps://www.retirebeforedad.com/rivian-stock-ipo/#:~:text=When%20is%20the%20Rivian%20IPO%20date%3F%20The%20Rivian,of%20the%20S-1%20filing%20occurred%20on%20October%201st.\nhttps://insideevs.com/news/545932/rivian-updates-ipo-price-range/#:~:text=The%20IPO%20stands%20for%20about%20for%20about%2017.6%25,IPO%20is%20now%20expected%20on%20November%209%2C%202021."], [86367, "2021-11-08T03:14:09Z", [0.2, 0.61, 0.19, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "Revising upwards on a report of revised valuation of $65bn\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/05/rivian-raises-ipo-price-range-and-could-now-be-worth-up-to-65-billion.html"], [67312, "2021-11-08T02:23:44Z", [0.23, 0.71, 0.06, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2021-11-08T01:26:01Z", [0.23, 0.63, 0.14, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2021-11-07T14:55:49Z", [0.0, 0.4, 0.6, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [79508, "2021-11-06T08:34:31Z", [0.1, 0.48, 0.42, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [67312, "2021-11-06T01:42:30Z", [0.23, 0.69, 0.07, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2021-11-05T15:27:56Z", [0.0, 0.38, 0.62, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [86367, "2021-11-05T04:49:02Z", [0.4, 0.48, 0.12, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "H/t @The_Fully_Clothed_Analyst\nThey have dropped the valuation from $80bn to $53bn now suggests tepid demand from institutional investors. \nMaybe there is a base rate to look at how stocks, whose initial IPO valuations have been revised downwards prior to the IPO, perform.
