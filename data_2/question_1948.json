Across two of the buckets (first years and other years), June numbers are on average lower than May numbers. In fact, only 4 of the last 23 years have seen increases from May to June, and all of them (00, 04, 16, and 20) were election years.   One thing I'm not sure quite what to make of is the giant spike in June and July of 2020, which is probably partially driven by all the discussion of police violence - perhaps wild notions about some coming civil war drove a spike in sales. Not a sure thing at all, but I'm inclined to believe that these two months are outliers as they quite clearly not in line with the summer patterns in any previous year (2016 also had a spike, but not nearly as dramatic, and 00 and 04 were tiny bumps/essentially flat, and all other years decreased from May to June).  To be over 12M, June would have to be ~5.3M, which would be ~13% higher than any other month ever. This strikes me as extraordinarily unlikely, especially given the lack of any obvious driver of gun-buying behavior in the last month. I'm assigning it 1% because zeroes make me uncomfortable. We haven't seen a month under 1.3M since 2013 I think, and the trend is clearly upward, so I'm going 0% on <8M. As for the two other buckets, I'll explore what I think are the most likely scenarios. If we use analogs of President first years, Obama 09 only, or Obama 09 and 12 to forecast June from January, February, March, April, and May data, we get a range of 2.5-3.8M with a mean of 3.15M and a median of 3.29M. Just looking at the May-June historical seasonality (including Presidential first years), I'd be inclined to give 8-10M a lot more weight than 10-12M (maybe as much as 80%+). I also get the sense based on the data that there was a rush to buy in the Nov-March time frame, but that bump appears to be returning closer to normal over the last two months. However, I do want to weigh in the mini-forecasts based on the data from the last few months combined with historical trends, which would put me close to even, but with a slight edge for 8-10M. Looking at all of that, I'm going to settle for 65% in the 8-10M bucket. I recognize this is very contrarian, so I figured I'd give a full explanation.

Besides those two cases it has averaged -3%, with a positive change in only 2 years out of 21. We'd need a 1.3% increase or larger to be above 10k, which occurred in 3 of 22 Junes (including 2016 and 2020).  Historic seasonality suggests another drop in June. That said, I thought the drop in May would be larger since we were at a higher point and were coming out of an election year and pandemic, but that doesn't seem to have been the case. May's drop was pretty much in line with historic numbers (-8.5%, vs -9.5% historically with SD of 6%). The uncertainty comes from the numbers being in a weird spot right now, and the risk of a mass shooting or other event in the next month scaring people into buying. We've had 11 major mass shootings in 5.5 years (2016-2021) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_shootings_in_the_United_States) including the recent San Jose rail yard shooting. There's no apparent preference for certain months so I assume the risk is equal over time, which puts the risk of one happening in June at about 17%. To cause a spike it'd have to happen sooner rather than later in the month and it's already the 6th, probably with at least 7 days left in the month, so that'd be a 10% chance of a mass shooting and subsequent increase. I'd bump that 2% for other possible events, for example like the George Floyd protests of last year, and add another 5% for uncertainty about applicability of historic trends to the currently very elevated numbers. The last main pieces of uncertainty come in around the hearings for David Chipman being appointed as the head of ATF and the spread of rhetoric about how he's going to take away everyone's guns, May purchases potentially being delayed to June by low inventories, lingering effects of the San Jose rail yard shooting, and an increase in the risk of a mass shooting as we reopen and large gatherings become more common. I don't have much confidence in my ability to price these in, all I know is that they're positive. Historically I've over-adjusted to new developments in my forecasts to my own detriment, so the total adjustment for all four of the previous factors combined is 7%, putting the 10-12M bucket at 24%.  Historically, background checks in June have increased by the requisite amount in 14% of months, so I am already betting on it at almost twice the base rate, but that still feels low.

The NRA has been in jeopardy due to their voluntary bankruptcy filing in the state of New York (which was declined in court) and their plans to move their domicile to Texas.\nWhat is interesting now, is that TX Gov. Abbott has recently signed into law a bill that grants permitless carry to all Texans, as it seems, unless they have been blocked from a firearm purchase in a criminal background check before.\nWith Montana, Utah and Tennessee csmonitor lists three more states that have joined the state coalition of 22 states in 2021.

Thus, I assume that between 5% and 10% of all new sales recorded in June 2021, which could come out at between 3.1mn and 3.4mn purchases (depending on the number of high scale events with large media coverage: criminal cases, assaults, mass shootings, terror attacks,...) under the April, May 2021 conditions, will now happen without leaving a trace of a NICS check at the FBI.\nAs a consequence, I have to revise down my forcast for June 2021 to 2.79mn to 3.23mn additional checks, which would almost certainly make the total of the months April through June 2021 fail to exceed 10.00mn NICS checks (they are required to exceed 3.263mn checks in June). Only in the extreme case, which would fuel much additional demand for firearms in all states but has little or no pent-up demand in the \"permitless carry\"-states, the third bin would still resolve this question.\nAnother thought of mine is, whether African Americans could have an incentive to increase the armament for self-defense (where eligible), now that the 100th anniversary of the 1921 Tulsa massacre is remembered and has some media coverage. It's really hard to say, until recently I clearly favored the third bin, but I also notice that in post-\"Trump insurgency\" times, the number of sales is likely to abate for some more month and normalize, since political order has been somewhat restored and uncertainty is kept at bay. Looting or fatal shootings happen, but at rates widely considered \"normal\" for the United States, and the reduction in checked sales could thus follow the same path as in June through September 2020, where advanced sales in the first month decimated new buyers in the following months."], [98516, "2021-06-03T14:00:34Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.47, 0.5, 0.03], "-2 on 8-10m\n+2 on 10-12m"], [99176, "2021-06-03T13:52:15Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.6, 0.2, 0.15], ""], [1333, "2021-06-03T07:57:52Z", [0.04, 0.12, 0.16, 0.28, 0.4], ""], [24139, "2021-06-03T04:03:52Z", [0.0, 0.25, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0], "revising estimate"], [3024, "2021-06-03T01:32:27Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.9, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [99857, "2021-06-03T01:21:01Z", [0.0, 0.13, 0.8, 0.07, 0.0], "April and May total of 6.734m makes passing 12m unlikely.

Prior to that there was a surge in the winter of 2015/16 following the San Bernadino shooting and increased talk of restrictions under the Obama administration. Pre-pandemic baseline would have been 5% and that momentum appears to be waning. That said, I'll still bump it up slightly to 7% with the caveat that an extreme event (large mass shooting) would significantly increase this probability. Conversely, with 3.266m needed to pass the 10m mark, a 17% drop in y/y checks would be very abnormal but still not impossible.

A more significant drop hasn't happened since Dec 2016 and only three times in the last 20 years, giving it a baseline chance of less than a 2% it will fall below 3.266m. But, after reading @p00h about the May-June jump (or lack thereof) it seems this should be upped. I'm completely fudging this math (someone please correct me..) but 2% big picture, divided by 15% month to month, puts me at 13% (6ish times more likely may-june than between the normal month to month)... sure...

I think I gave too much credence to the recent huge spike in my prior forecast, though it was difficult to say where it would stop. Now that a lot of the distortion from the election should be subsiding, I'd expect a return to more normal historical trends. April is just above the monthly threshold for 10M, so it could easily fall on either side. As for mass shootings and gun control bills, its unclear what's going to happen, which makes the outcome barring a drastic change very hard to predict. We may see more mass shootings as we come out of a relative lull from COVID which would make the seasonal dip smaller or potentially make the rate rise, or the initial hype around gun control legislation under Biden may die down with nothing getting done, as unfortunately seems to be the pattern.
