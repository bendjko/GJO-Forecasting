The DJTA includes airlines, transportation (marine, railroads, trucking) and delivery services. Historic performance doesn't need to explain future behaviour so I tried with other indicator like Brent and got a strong direct correlation from Jan 1st 2018 (which means that either my data and/or calculations are wrong or that there is no causality). My assumption was that higher oil price should impact the stock prices of the companies included on the index, but couldn't see that. Still, oil should be an indicator, if only due to phycological reasons. Short term price most likely will go up: \"What is today\u2019s oil market telling us? opec agreed in December to cut production. Demand is picking up. The spot price has risen from $53 to $70 a barrel since the start of the year. The market may well tighten further in the short term. Saudi Arabia, opec\u2019s largest producer, is pumping less than its quota; it seems keen on higher prices. Meanwhile foreign-policy hawks in America want to tighten the screws on Iran\u2019s oil exports. Power cuts in oil-rich but inflation-ravaged Venezuela have further reduced its capacity to pump oil.\" [1] Let's say the impact is -5 points to the 11K to 12K range. Macro data in the short term seems favourable (no recession on sight before August 30th as per my own estimate, strong performance of services [2]) at least for a few months. I add +10 points to the 11K to 12K range, given we are now very close to the 11K mark. Airlines business is having some issues: - Main one, in my opinion, the Boeing 737 MAX crashes (Southwest, American and United reported as 737 MAX major customers [3]). This might limit number of routes, revenue generation and efficiencies. Seeking compensation from Boeing will go further than August 30th.\n- Jet Airways, WOW and maybe Norwegian's problems. Opportunities for all carriers or just low-cost ones?\n- A curiosity, or an indicator: in-flight entertainment [4]. No impact short term, but tough competition is mentioned.\n- Another one: flight attendants routes [5], no impact either, but also interesting. Over all, -7.5% 11K to 12K.
