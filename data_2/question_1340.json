If it falls to the weak side, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (hkma) is obliged to sell as many American dollars as people want to buy for hk$7.85. That has stopped the currency falling further\u201d\n\u201cAccording to its defenders, Hong Kong\u2019s currency peg is \u201cvirtually impregnable\u201d. The hkma\u2019s foreign-exchange reserves amount to $440bn, twice as much as the money supply, narrowly defined to include banknotes and the banks\u2019 claims on the monetary authority. The banks would run out of Hong Kong dollars before it ran out of American ones.\nWhy then is it only \u201cvirtually\u201d impregnable? For one thing, there are broader definitions of money supply. A war chest of $440bn may be large compared with banks\u2019 deposits at the hkma. But it is small compared with customers\u2019 deposits with banks (hk$6.9trn, equivalent to $880bn). If every depositor wanted to convert their holdings into American dollars, there would not be enough to go around.\nSuch conversions would also have broader economic implications. Every Hong Kong dollar sold to the monetary authority disappears. All else equal, it then becomes dearer for the banks to borrow the diminishing number of Hong Kong dollars that remain. These high interest rates make holding the currency more lucrative and short-selling it more costly. But insofar as households and firms still need to borrow in Hong Kong dollars, these high interest rates also hurt the economy. How much pain would Hong Kong be willing to take?\nThe peg\u2019s downfall may be imaginable. But is it probable? One place to look is the options market, where investors can hedge against the risk of the currency moving outside the band. For about 40% of the period from June 2005 to July 2018, option prices implied that the odds of the peg breaking were above 10%, suggests a recent study by Samuel Drapeau, Tan Wang and Tao Wang of Shanghai Jiao Tong University. But for most of that time markets were betting on the currency strengthening past hk$7.75 to the dollar, not weakening past hk$7.85.\u201c"], [691, "2020-02-11T12:48:46Z", [0.0], ""], [767, "2020-02-11T00:20:50Z", [0.1], ""], [1333, "2020-02-07T13:29:04Z", [0.05], ""], [691, "2020-02-06T19:12:58Z", [0.0], ""], [63489, "2020-02-03T16:23:59Z", [0.78], "Any one-day close will qualify; devaluation of currency is a strong possibility given continuing political and economic unrest."], [1333, "2020-02-03T09:07:35Z", [0.1], ""], [78034, "2020-02-03T07:28:52Z", [0.0], ""], [31275, "2020-01-29T00:25:15Z", [0.27], "Today it is 7.78.

Notice how adorable they are: they make their projections with dart-throwing pandas, which are widely known to outperform dart-throwing chimps. Now, according to Tetlock's research, inevitable means about 80% probability. Using (1-0.056)^28 = 0.199, which the 0.199 the probability that the old peg will survive and 28 the number of years till the one country two systems expires,  this gives us a 5.6% probability of having a peg to the RMB per year. Summing (1) and (2) gives me a 10.6% of breakdown of the peg during the next year. If I notice that there are eight months, this gives me a 7%. Now, a few of the possible additions coming from the inside view are the following: (i) The original reason of the peg in 1983 was the uncertainty of the future of HK after the hangover. Sorry, I meant handover. This leaves (i.a) the peg is even more needed today than then, (i.b) maybe helmsman Xi will find this insulting, as everything in China is so much much better than in the west. (ii) The leadership of the HKMA (Hong Kong Monetary Authority) has recently changed, on the 1st of October. The new incumbent, Eddie Yue, has stated that there is no need to change the peg [1]. (iii) HK is used to move money from China to elsewhere. Now that capital controls are more and more strict by the day (getting money out of the country is a real pain), HK remains a loophole. The question is whether this is considered a bug or a feature by the communist party: should we avoid medium to high ranking officials to get their money out easily? or should that provoke too much of a backlash from within? (iv) The (apparently defunct) extradition bill was a close call, with a clear message of \"get your money out of HK and go to Hongcouver to get a new passport, ASAP\". The message might still be valid, and this might require some countermeasures. (v) The \"Hong-Kong has no future\" catchphrase has been part of Chinese propaganda since 2014. Being propaganda, it's probably only verborrhea. But who knows if they plan to do something with the excuse of the ongoing protests. I might try to integrate them into a more complete probability in future updates of this forecast.
