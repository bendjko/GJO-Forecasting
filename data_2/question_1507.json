The state cannot fine people it elects to represent them for not voting the way they choose.  At the same point, the question of electors voting on whether they can be mandated by the state is a different issue. When it comes to Congress, we think of our leaders as elected to make decisions based on their best judgment. That appears to be the same intent when it comes to the Electoral College ... not a great plan, but a plan nonetheless. Send people of our party we trust to vote on things the way we ask them to.  So the issue of deciding they have to vote a particular way has parallels in looking at the Senate and House, and would beg the question as to whether the state could bind them to vote Democrat or Republican on issues.

Well, maybe, but every timer there is a case that could slant the field toward the conservatives, he votes to do so.   Hence, I think he will vote with the conservatives.   I know I have focused on the politics without discussing the legal issues and theories at all.  However, most legal theories on this issue are results oriented.  For example, the doctrine of original intent is only followed by its conservative proponents when it yields a result the conservatives like--otherwise they ignore it.  See for example,  Bush v. Gore where Justice Thomas who correctly stated that the equal protection clause was only intended to apply to race cases, voted to apply the doctrine of equal  protection to an election case where there was no issue of race.  He did so because to do otherwise might have resulted in Al Gore becoming president. "], [53391, "2020-02-08T00:05:21Z", [0.1], "This question is not can the state control the electors but can the state fine an elector for breaking their pledge when being appointed.  Maybe the point of the fine is to control the elector or maybe the fine is to limit the pool of candidates for elector to only those who will not vote in bad faith. The petitioner are saying the purpose of the fine is to control the elector after being appointed (probaly intrudes on federal roles).  Washington is saying its a fine for making a false pledge (definetly a State role).  A $1000 fine is not going to control an elector decision. A $100,000 fine probably would control the elector decision.\nI think the court fudges and says the State can fine but the fine can not be so large as to prevent the elector from executing their independent judgement to select an elector.  Why not just say the State is not allowed to levy any fine? Because the State has the right to establish the conditions for the appointment of electors and if an elector intentionally violates those conditions then there should be a penalty for bad faith.  As I said its a fudge. They fudge to keep the ruling narrow, no large sweeping opinions.  Just recognize what everyone agrees on. Electors make a choice, States appoint electors, and the current system has fines. The decision can be written not to upset Blair.  What the decision accomplishes is a flag to electors that they can vote their conscience, and more will do just that, and we have more court cases in the future.

My guess is that originalists are more likely to side with plaintiffs, given the constitutional language indicating electors are meant to exercise their judgement rather than quasi-ceremonially confirm the state vote (and thus fining them for fulfilling their constitutional obligation seems unacceptable).  Other schools of thought are likely to be much less sympathetic, and more likely to attend to the risks of political fallout if faithless electors became common (or gave a different determination of the result), or to a general norm of democracy which this could be seen to undermine. So, my guesswork on the Justices (likelihood of voting 'yes'): Thomas: Arch-originalist (~95%)\nGinsburg: Not sympathetic to originalism (~10%)\nBreyer: Notably pragmatist (~5%) \nRoberts: Pragmatist, and politically sensitive (~10%)\nAlito: Seems hard to guess - reliably conservative, but particularist, and generally in favour of states rights etc. (~40%)\nSotomayor: Also hard to guess, I suspect would be inclined to follow Breyer, Ginsburg etc. (~20%)\nKagan: Pragmatist (~10%) \nGorsuch: Originalist leanings (~80%)\nKavanaugh: Reliably conservative, and so perhaps some 'originalist' style leanings (55%) Which gives ~ 3-4 votes.

But Ray also left unanswered the question of what happens if an elector violates this pledge after they are appointed to the Electoral College.  Ray held that \u201ceven if such promises of candidates for the electoral college are legally unenforceable ... it would not follow that the requirement of a pledge\u201d is unconstitutional. But that holding explicitly avoids the question of whether an elector\u2019s pledge to support their party\u2019s nominee can be enforced if violated. Chiafalo and Baca now place that question squarely before the justices \u2014 and the argument that faithless electors may choose not to vote for the candidate they pledged to support is hardly frivolous.

It also seems clear that there are circumstances in which the framers clearly intended for electors to be free to change their votes, although they did not explicitly prohibit states from preventing this for their own electors. To some extent this flexibility reflected the communication limitations of the time, but it also reflects a continuing need for the election process to always yield an unambiguous winner. The question in my mind is how SCOTUS will view this historical legacy in light of modern traditions and needs; and how they will balance the right of States to set their own rules in the absence of clear wording in the constitution.  In the absence of clear precedent, my guess is that they will choose on the basis of: \n1) the literal language of the constitution on the issue\n2) the intention of the framers as best it can be inferred \n3) Republican and/or Democrat bias of each member I don't know the political argument, but I would assume that conservative members will generally want to allow States to require electors to vote as committed; and Democrats will want electors to be free to change their vote. However I could be 180 off on that. If that's the case then it seems like there are a lot of headwinds to SCOTUS finding in favor of the electors.
