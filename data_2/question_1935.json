I have no doubt that at that point Iran would have happily complied with the deal. The Biden administration is essentially taking the same position as the Trump administration and saying that the original deal was not good enough. They are using the concessions the Trump administration put in place as leverage to try to extract new concessions.  Basically I see the United States as an arrogant bully that is used to getting its way. There has never been any real evidence that Iran has a nuclear weapons program. The IAEA has debunked every accusation made by the US and Israel. During the Iran Iraq war Iraq was invading Iran and using chemical weapons against them. I ran had the ability to make chemical weapons in return but they didn't because it was against their religion to use weapons of mass destruction, even though the outcome of the war was not certain and their lives and families were at risk. If they weren't willing to create weapons of mass destruction then why would they now? If Iran does have a nuclear weapons program it is because the United States has pushed them into it. The benefit of this agreement is that it would help stop the United States and Israel from attacking Iran for no reason. (I recommend the book Manufactured Crisis.) Keep in mind that both Iran and the United States are signatories to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty. This means that the United States has a treaty with iran, ratified by Congress and therefore binding under the constitution, which says that Iran has the right to develop nuclear material as long as it does not reach weapons grade. This means that all of the enrichment that Iran has been doing they have a right to do under that treaty and the US is violating the terms of the treaty by trying to penalize them for it. It is understandable that Iran does not believe anything the United States says. At this point Iran is asking for assurances that the United States will stay in the agreement. The United States says they could not guarantee what the next president would do, which is absolutely correct because in a democracy the people have a right to vote in a new president who wants to go in a new direction. And I don't see Congress ratifying the agreement to bind it on the next president. So then Iran asked for assurances that at least the Biden administration will honor the agreement until the end of Biden's term. The US wouldn't even agree to that. Lifting sanctions is really worthless for Iran without those guarantees because companies will not enter and invest in Iran unless they know there can be some stability that they can be there for several years and conduct business without being forced to leave. I'm a little concerned about what all of this means. If the United States would have allowed the agreement to be renewed earlier it would have helped the prior more moderate Iranian president stay in power. Instead it looks to me as if the United States intentionally wanted the more hardline Iranian president to come to power because that would help Iran look more like a bad guy and would justify more aggressive action against them. It really looks to me as if the Biden administration wants to give the impression that they tried to make a deal but they really don't want a deal, they want Iran to look like the bad guy."], [90157, "2021-11-20T04:22:38Z", [0.01], ""], [95503, "2021-11-19T17:26:12Z", [0.07], ""], [98424, "2021-11-19T01:30:23Z", [0.07], ""], [484, "2021-11-19T00:01:08Z", [0.3], "Down 10% for passage of time."], [103290, "2021-11-18T23:48:31Z", [0.0], ""], [62808, "2021-11-18T23:19:26Z", [0.03], ""], [62808, "2021-11-18T23:19:10Z", [0.5], ""], [28899, "2021-11-18T21:10:27Z", [0.08], ""], [87827, "2021-11-18T14:04:57Z", [0.03], ""], [84880, "2021-11-18T03:31:52Z", [0.01], ""], [87897, "2021-11-18T01:27:19Z", [0.08], "lowering again as time runs out"], [79142, "2021-11-17T16:09:57Z", [0.12], ""], [102664, "2021-11-17T02:25:41Z", [0.03], "Biden Administration certainly views this as a priority and negotiations are resuming on 29 Nov in Vienna.

Moreover, Iran currently experiences high tensions on its northern borders with Azerbaijan where it has multimillion Azeri population. Iran has deployed heavy military arsenal and warned that it would not tolerate any attack on its sovereignty. Making compromises in other international directions would undermine Raisi's domestic reputation as a hardline actor. The Biden administration has already mentioned more than once that they are ready to discuss JCPOA revival, but they have not received any substantive offers. They see their announcement of rejoining JCPOA as a main compromise to Iran. Taking into account the withdrawal from Afghanistan, the administration is unlikely to demonstrate much more detached position in this part of the Middle East. Even some European partners seem to be more flexible on this question, but their position had little effect on the US position. If you add to this equation Israel's hardened posture, everything becomes more puzzled. Recent developments in the US-Russia relations in terms of closing the Russian representation in NATO also demonstrates that the US currently is constrained in its eastern policies. I think when two states come from directly opposite political blocks with some turbulent political background, it is vital to lay a basis to recover the trust and willingness to understand each other's concerns.

By ruthlessly engineering the election of a hard-liner\u2019s hard-liner to the presidency, Mr. Khamenei has slammed the door on normalization and nailed it shut. \n> That\u2019s only one of the problems afflicting the JCPOA. Instead of welcoming the Biden administration\u2019s eagerness to return to President Obama\u2019s Iran policy, Tehran has turned up its nose at American attempts to chart a course back to mutual compliance with the terms of the deal. The ease with which President Trump was able to dump the JCPOA, and the inability of outraged Europeans to contest his imposition of unilateral sanctions, created a healthy skepticism in Iran about the deal\u2019s value. Tehran has realized that an executive agreement like the JCPOA has no legal force in the U.S. It is not simply that a future president could follow Mr. Trump\u2019s footsteps and reject the nuclear deal. President Biden could sign the JCPOA one week and reimpose American sanctions on whatever grounds he chose the next, and Iran would have no recourse. \n> Rather than seeing American withdrawals from Afghanistan and Iraq as friendly gestures meriting a constructive response, the mullahs appear to have interpreted them as a sign that the Biden administration can be safely defied. Likely believing the White House is bent on Middle East withdrawal, no matter the cost, Tehran seems to have decided to double down on its confrontational approach to capitalize on perceived U.S. weakness. \n> A deepening confrontation with a radicalizing Iran is not what the Biden administration expected from its Middle East policy, but that is the reality with which it must cope. Attempting to placate Tehran through patience and restraint will likely only stoke the regime\u2019s ambitions. The smell of blood in the water rarely inspires feelings of moderation and restraint among sharks.

I agree with your premise that both sides continue to have incentives to come to agreement. My point was that Iran and Iranian leaders tend to have a much longer time horizon than do Western democracies with comparatively frequent and meaningful elections. The clerical Iranian leaders likely see no dissonance between this shocking breach of international law (in my earlier post about Iranian intelligence seeking to kidnap an American on U.S. soil) and their continued, slow, painful negotiations in Geneva. The current grouping of states seeking to subvert the post-World War II rules-based International Order (China, Russia, North Korea, Iran) all engage in these so-called \u201csalami-slicing\u201d tactics, to which I did not give adequate weight. I was previously well above the crowd (80%) and this event caused me to reevaluate my excessive optimism for a resolution within our question\u2019s timeframe. I agree they very well may come to agreement, but I am just not as optimistic as I was that it would be in time for a \u201cyes\u201d on our question. In reference to your comparison, I do see important differences. In my view, one situation is a difference of tactics over confronting Russia\u2019s potential economic coercion among long-standing treaty allies with myriad, deep shared political, economic, cultural, and strategic values and interests. The other situation is a multi-decade pariah nation posing a grave threat to international peace and security. The U.S. tends to allow wide latitude to its allies in many areas, much to the chagrin of elements of the American public. We have no view on the Canadian, British, or German public health insurance systems, for example, even though this serves as a significant competitive advantage for them in trade since their public pays for something that is a cost for U.S. firms. We did not force European allies to break diplomatic ties with Iran or Cuba, for example. Canadian executives running businesses in Cuba that were expropriated from U.S. citizens fear few, if any, repercussions. This is a much different situation than with respect to Iran, which has been an adversary for 42 years. In my view, it remains to be seen whether the clerics in Tehran believe they \u201cneed\u201d to work with the U.S. or even agree that is possible to do so in way that guarantees their regime\u2019s continued existence. I tend to think they are close watchers of U.S. politics and will be seeing what happens in the 2022 midterms. If the Dems get trounced and lose the House or Senate or both, then I think the mullahs will say, \u201cwhat value is an agreement with one third of the U.S. Government, which may be gone in two more years, replaced someone who will snap back to 2017?\u201d"], [59836, "2021-07-18T13:30:24Z", [0.15], "Decreasing -75% due to the pause in negotiations until Raisi takes over.

The recent IAEA-Iran monitoring deal has expired, and reports suggest Western diplomats are warning Iran that failure to renew or extend the deal will potentially hinder an effective resolution to talks. Iran has indicated willingness to extend access to IAEA officials for one month, most likely a ploy to try and strengthen its bargaining position. It's still unclear how the talks are proceeding in regard to sanctions. That is a major sticking point for both the U.S. and Iran.

However, domestic and external factors may delay when the U.S. can rejoin the JCPOA. I don't think that the domestic politics in either country (i.e. Republicans v. Democrats or the upcoming Iranian Presidential elections) will play too heavy of a role. In Iran, Khamenei pretty much holds all of the power when it comes to foreign policy. With talks continuing to happen, it's generally a good sign he is interested in striking a deal for moving forward. I don't see the upcoming presidential elections having a significant impact on the outcomes of the talks and the U.S.' ability to rejoin the deal. In the U.S., the Biden administration currently has the support of Congress, and it will be important to have as many political wins before the Congressional 2022 elections. However, as time goes on, and depending on the success of the next round of more controversial domestic bills being introduced, the current administration may lose some support in Congress, but again, I don't think this will have a significant impact on that 1 January deadline. What I think will really matter in the next few months will be the influence of third-party nations to the discussions, especially Israel.

Any other actions to the same degree or greater as those suspected by Israelis in Natanz will most certainly put in jeopardy the U.S.' ability to reenter the JCPOA by 1 January 2022 since Israel is a historically close ally in the region. https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/high-level-talks-resume-returning-us-iran-nuclear-77550806\nhttps://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/tehran/inside/govt.html\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-56734657"], [88452, "2021-05-09T09:34:30Z", [1.0], "\"With the Iranian elections approaching in June, the nuclear talks are more important than ever.

The real questions here is how committed is Iran to the agreement and do they really have the ability/compacity to refine enough uranium for a nuclear bomb if they want to?  While Iran has a highly educated society and capable scientists, do the they have the resources and/or the real desire to have a nuclear bomb?  For example, despite being an oil rich country, energy prices in Iran are extremely high in comparison to other countries in the region.  This could make an argument for and against domestic nuclear energy.  On one hand the capital investment required to build a domestic nuclear reactor is in the billions (just look at the current nuclear power plant being built in Georgia, which is being delayed and at least a billion over budget).  On the other hand, once up and running, domestic nuclear energy is fairly cheap.

Perhaps the US is using Trump's sanctions as a tool to get the Irans to throw their hands up, but in the end the US will be the accomodator.

So it\u2019s possible it could take quite some time for Iran to re-enter compliance, even after it ceases to enrich uranium to 20%. \n2.The deal includes European nations as well, and NATO has just expanded its presence and mission in Iraq (https://www.npr.org/2021/02/19/969351655/nato-announces-plan-to-increase-presence-in-iraq). Iran may be less likely to want to negotiate with increased Western military activity in its backyard. The threat from Israel is also something to consider, with the assassination of a top Iranian scientist by the Mossad in November. \n3.

The main reason a rejoining of the deal is not assured is that \"hawks\" in Iran, and the US (and Israel) seem to be opposed to any deal with one another. As the Iranian government is largely unchanged since the original deal and the new US administration is committed to a deal in some fashion the \"hawks\" seem unlikely to sway the more moderate governing coalitions in both Iran and the US.

Oil production is set to increase in April, and Iranian non-compliance is set to increase beyond present measures within days. It is reasonable to infer that the Saudis are offering through this backdoor mechanism 'cover fire' for potential US actions. There is no secret that that multiple gulf states (and Israel) are oppositional to JCPOA as it stands because the general consensus seems to be (from their perspectives) that it effectively allows Iran to advance nuclear research under the cover of civilian means and intent.

Iran will stop IAEA inspections Feb. 21 if U.S. doesn't lift the sanctions. Reversible but still a potential escalation in the wrong direction. Biden seems to have shifted his messaging from wanting to rejoin the nuclear deal, to rejoining on the condition of Iran first complying with the original agreement by reducing their uranium from the current 20%.  Biden's secretary of state (Blinken) and director of national intelligence (Haines) have both cast doubt on it being a quick process. Following quote is from Haines, \u201c(Biden) has indicated that if Iran were to come back into compliance, that he would direct that we do so as well. And I think, frankly, that we are a long ways from that.\"  I only wish there was a timeline given beyond \" a long ways.\" If that means more than 6 months, then the Iranian election happens and suddenly seems like the window to get this done passed us by?  It's possible the game of chicken is all an act for both governments to appear strong or try to gain extra concession points.  On the other hand, here's my case for both sides actually being stonewalled. Iran complied with the deal until U.S. unexpectedly pulled out in 2018 and slapped tough sanctions, then killed Soleimani in a questionable manner. What incentive does Iran have to re-join? Lifted sanctions. But what good does that do if U.S. can pull out again in 4 years with another presidential change and slap on sanctions again.. back to square 1. U.S. has proved an unreliable and unpredictable partner for Iran, it is possible they don't want to deal with us right now without us first lifting the sanctions at least? On the U.S. side, does Biden want to spend political capital having to make the first move of lifting sanctions without Iran first reducing Uranium quantities? He will be attacked for appearing weak and appeasing Iran.  Biggest hopes for it happening are either Iran being sick of sanctions and reducing uranium, or Biden wanting to live up to the campaign promise and caving by lifting sanctions first. Both very possible, but I keep finding myself wondering if either was the case, why hasn't it happened yet?

Final item for caution: one of the smartest people on the Middle East, former Obama advisor Dennis Ross says there's no rush to rejoin the JCPOA to defuse tensions with Iran.[3] [1] https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-iran-deal/2021/01/29/9001d8a0-625a-11eb-9430-e7c77b5b0297_story.html\n[2] https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/13/us/politics/robert-malley-iran-middle-east.html\n[3] https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/01/19/biden-doesnt-need-rush-back-into-iran-nuclear-deal-defuse-tensions/"], [67232, "2021-02-13T17:35:19Z", [0.95], ""], [95503, "2021-02-13T13:32:09Z", [0.6], ""], [95503, "2021-02-13T12:27:34Z", [0.45], ""], [94872, "2021-02-13T04:03:59Z", [0.55], ""], [88452, "2021-02-13T03:00:51Z", [1.0], ""], [484, "2021-02-13T02:36:36Z", [0.95], "Up 20% to be ahead of the consensus."], [92079, "2021-02-13T02:31:32Z", [1.0], ""], [85986, "2021-02-13T01:55:39Z", [0.75], ""], [74903, "2021-02-12T21:03:39Z", [0.85], ""], [96721, "2021-02-12T20:48:05Z", [0.65], ""], [97522, "2021-02-12T20:29:59Z", [0.25], "I do see the US rejoining the Iran deal at some point in the future, and quite possibly under a Biden administration. Based on the current state of affairs I doubt a resolution can be reached before the end of 2021. Political concessions will have to be made by 2 or more parties to make ammends. Original negotiations took nearly 2.5 years ... and that was from the official meeting of P5+1 in Geneva which discounts the years of back channel talks between lower officials and proxies. Current bad blood leads me to be skeptical of political resolutions any time soon, but hey crazier things have happened in the 2020s."], [62808, "2021-02-12T20:26:36Z", [1.0], ""], [62808, "2021-02-12T20:26:27Z", [0.81], ""], [53391, "2021-02-12T20:13:39Z", [0.5], "Maybe.

I am assuming that this question resolves as yes even if the agreement gets modified. It's important to understand that Iran is still in compliance with the agreement and always has been. The JCPOA states that if the US ever leaves the agreement then some of the restrictions on Iran lift. So Iran can enrich uranium to the level that they are currently and is still in compliance with the agreement because of the fact that the United States left the agreement. But now the United States is trying to use the sanctions put in place by the Trump administration as a lever to get additional concessions out of Iran. I believe this is not in good faith, especially considering the fact that this is the exact same negotiation team that originally set up the agreement in the first place. As additional context, keep in mind that both Iran and the United States are signatories to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. This is a treaty that has been ratified by the US Congress, so it is binding under the US Constitution. The non-proliferation treaty states that Iran has the right to produce civilian grade nuclear material (which is understood to mean up to about 90% enrichment) . This means that the United States has agreed by a treaty binding under the US Constitution that Iran has the right to enrich material up to 90%. So it is arguably a treaty violation for the United States to put sanctions on Iran for enriching only up to 20%. whenever Iran goes to the negotiation table they always say they have a right to do this, and they are absolutely correct because the United States has agreed they have the right to do this. Not only that, but the non-proliferation treaty states that more developed nations like the United States have an obligation to assist developing nations like Iran in developing their program.  I'll also point out that it doesn't matter if they produce more civilian-grade material than they could possibly use in their reactor, because it is a product that can be sold internationally. Even the United States has purchased heavy water from Iran. Accusing Iran of wanting to develop a nuclear weapon just because they are producing more material than they could possibly use, is like accusing the United States of wanting to destroy the environment because they cut down more trees than they use every year. It is an exportable product, and Iran has the right to produce it under treaty. if you go through the last several decades the United States has consistently acted in bad faith with Iran. Us politics in the Middle East is very simple: the United States does whatever Saudi Arabia and Israel want it to do. However, the Biden administrations exit from the Yemen conflict leads me to think that the Biden administration is willing to ignore what Saudi Arabia wants to a certain extent. Ultimately I think both the United States and Iran want this to happen. It's just a matter of weather something stupid happens along the way to sabotage the situation."], [1333, "2021-02-12T19:38:37Z", [1.0], ""], [1333, "2021-02-12T19:34:27Z", [0.1], ""], [95503, "2021-02-12T19:28:58Z", [0.3], ""], [691, "2021-02-12T19:26:02Z", [0.52], ""], [87827, "2021-02-12T19:14:08Z", [0.75], "Initial forecast I would guess this is pretty likely.
