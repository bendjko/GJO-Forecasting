The challenger, Jamie Harrison (Democrat) raised an astounding $14 million over the same two months. Jamie Harrison is likely the strongest Democratic challenger to this Senate seat in a long time, and Lindsey Graham may be at his most vulnerable - even the most staunch of Southern Republicans can't help but make fun of his weasly ways.
