There doesn't seem to be much speculation regarding the test moving forward in the fall. Sweden has used a more open approach with COVID, as far as avoiding lockdown / closing the economy, there pattern of diagnosed cases each week has been quite consistent with around 400-700 new cases per day over the last few weeks [2]. It is unclear if that pattern will continue, or if immunity will build up, driving the infection rate down.
