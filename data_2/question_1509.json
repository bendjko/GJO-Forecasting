By some estimates the US might be facing the worst quarter of economic growth since records began.  In answering this question there are nine different possible paths of interest rates, looking at the movement from now until 29th April, and then the movement from the 29th April until the 10th June: Lower Lower, Lower Same, Lower Higher, Same Lower etc. Given the environment that we are in, with economic activity falling and a recent sharp fall in the oil price, I think it is possible to virtually eliminate any options which include \"Higher\" in either period, leaving the options LL, LS, SL, SS.\nGiven the lower and upper bound are 0-0.25% any move lower would encompass the lower bound breaching the zero bound (assuming that we maintain a 25bps difference between the 2 rates). I think this is unlikely because:\n\u2022\tThe previous and first time rates were at this record low level was during the financial crisis, when the US economy was again facing very significant challenges, the Fed still did not decide to push rates lower than 0% (as close as we can come to a base rate)\n\u2022\tThe experience of Europe and Japan with negative interest rates since then, is likely to further dissuade the Fed from pushing rates lower\nThere is a possibility that the upper bound is lowered while maintaining the lower bound at 0%, although I can\u2019t find a historical precedent for this (happy to be shown otherwise?). In the case that the Fed did either breach the 0% level or reduced the spread between the upper and lower bound, it is still possible that they do this before the forecasting dates and then keep the rates the same over the forecasting period i.e. a Lower Same option. On the flip side it is possible if the extent to the economic damage is revealed to be worse than previously thought, the Fed may keep rates the same until the forecasting period, before deciding to lower again with more data evident. Taking this all of this into account, I believe same should be heavily weighted taking into account the Fed\u2019s actions following 2008, lower as a low probability, and higher as a very outside chance.  https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20200315a1.pdf\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/20/goldman-sees-an-unprecedented-stop-of-economic-activity-with-2nd-quarter-gdp-contracting-by-24percent.html"], [40584, "2020-03-22T03:49:14Z", [0.1, 0.9, 0.0], ""], [15196, "2020-03-21T13:55:51Z", [0.0, 0.85, 0.15], ""], [80662, "2020-03-21T03:48:52Z", [0.0, 0.98, 0.02], "Economic effects of pandemic will still be felt and Fed will still be propping up the economy.
