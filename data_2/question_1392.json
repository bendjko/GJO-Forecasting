Factors that could reduce victim losses are the various counter measures (2 step authentication, bio-metric credit cards etc among a host of other measures), awareness campaigns, crack down on hacking groups, closure of dark web market places selling malware etc. 2018 reported figure for victim losses is 2.7 billion.
