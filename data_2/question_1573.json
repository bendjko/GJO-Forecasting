Mean daily deaths would have to be ~80 or less for this to miss (a drop of 4X-5X from current numbers). New cases are also rising, but this may be due more to increased testing than increased incidence.  Data from Spain, Germany, and Italy suggest it's unlikely to see a turn around in the death rate in less than 12 days. Anything approaching the current rate for more than a week would require a near halt in deaths to stay below 7000.  Finally, there is some evidence that the official count missed hundreds of deaths at home. Increased accuracy in the count would thus also push the numbers up.
