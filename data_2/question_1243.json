A list on Wikipedia of her novels: The Edible Woman (1969), Surfacing (1972), Lady Oracle (1976), Life Before Man (1979), *Bodily Harm (1981), *The Handmaid's Tale (1985), Cat's Eye (1988), The Robber Bride (1993), *Alias Grace (1996), *The Blind Assassin (2000), *Oryx and Crake (2003), The Penelopiad (2005), *The Year of the Flood (2009), *MaddAddam (2013), *The Heart Goes Last (2015), *Hag-Seed (2016), and the book in question, The Testaments (2019).[1] (Starred are on the list). Baseline, if you wanted to use all her novels would be 9/16 or 56%. It probably makes sense to drop the first four, which gives us 9/12 or 75% as a floor prediction. She's made the list for every novel but one for the last +20 years, so 7/8 or 88%. And, since Trump got into office, The Handmaiden's Tale spent something like 100 weeks on the list, and this is a sequel. This is being published on September 10th. It's probably already a bestseller based on pre-orders. I think we can safely call this one 100%.
