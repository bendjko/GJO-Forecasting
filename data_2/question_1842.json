But will this year be as dry as last year? I think there will very likely be more deforestation in 2021 than in 2020. But I don't think a drought of the same magnitude as in 2020 is likely.

And Bolsonaro has just cut money for enforcement. However, he has requested international help, but whether any country decides to strike a deal with him on this topic remains to be seen. So, unless current directions change, I think there are likely to be more fires this year because 1) many individuals perceive deforestation and the fires that go with it to be in their best interest, 2) there will likely be even less enforcement this year than last year, and 3) the federal government supports unregulated land use in general.  \"\u201cFire season\u201d in Amazonia begins in July when farmers in the region typically clear their land with fire to grow crops.

On the other hand, with la nina, that could mean a lower threat of wildfires like weather experts at AccuWeather forecast for South America this la nina season. I will weight their opinion more. There are other factors I looked at like el nino cycles and la nina cycles and compared to the historical wildfire graph to find correlations.

Here, they list 3, not 4 (as advertised in the title) main reasons why it is burning. Increased farming in the rainforest, which causes deforestation, infrastructure development and deforestation due to silence on the part of Bolsonaro, and road choked streams. These factors are only going to increase, due to the growing population of Brazil, Bolsonaro\u2019s unwillingness to spend money on saving the environment and using it for his benefit, and increasing infrastructure including roads. Segments of forests that have burned already, constitute only a small fraction of the total acreage of Amazonian rainforests, therefore there is still a lot more that could burn in the fire season (June-November) of next year. The second question was answered by https://www.globalfiredata.org/updates.html, which has month to month fire data. DUe to raising trends in deforestation which has a direct correlation to fires, I predict that 2021 will have an increased chance of meeting and or exceeding the 2020 fire count.

The average SST of the two time periods I selected when added together, multiplied by a random factor and added to the prior year's number of fires prove to be a moderate (~70% accuracy) predictor of the number of fires in a given year.

This, coupled with the correlation made (in an article posted May 22nd on the same website below) to the rise in fires with the rise in ocean temperatures, that is likely to continue to increase with global warming, makes me believe the number and intensity of fires in 2021 should increase. Without significant advocacy or enforceable governmental restriction, I don't see this changing, and potentially exceeding 2005 numbers (when the El' Nino drought caused significant increases in fires). Interestingly, the pattern of droughts in the rainforest has occurred in 2005, 2010, and 2015/16, which puts the course for additional drought activity patterned for 2020/21. Research has found that \"... when two areas in the Atlantic Ocean which are situated north and south of each other start to go out of phase \u2013 that is when temperatures are rising in one, but decreasing in the other \u2013 the Amazon is likely to experience a severe drought within 1-1.5 years.\" (from TiPES article  #2). Furthermore, as noted in an EcoWatch study, \"Faced with the effects of climate change, there is a risk that the Northern Hemisphere will heat up faster than the South, which would stimulate the occurrence of the Atlantic dipole and lead to a more intense frequency of droughts in the Amazon.\" (See EcoWatch article #3).

It has risen every year from 2014 except after 2016 which was a huge jump from 2015. Even if it reaches +700 this year that isn't too much to overcome for next year since it does seem to be following a rising trend from year to year. However the q is will total fire be more, so it only needs to be +1 from this year. Right now our total is 7420 and if we imagine it rises to closer to 7500 we only see 5 years since 2003 eclipsing that total and only 2 since 2010. Because our jumps are not uniform or consistent in anyway I can see, it makes more sense to look at totals. Therefore it would be improbable for it to hit over 7500 for 2021 as that only happened 5 times in 18 years or 28% (Baseline?). Because of climate change and a general rise over the last few years which may indicate a larger trend im giving it a 35% chance to cross 2020's number and will update every month.
