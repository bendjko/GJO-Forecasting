At least in Europe (but I think FDA is the same) you need to provide better results, either effectiveness or less side effects (or some combination thereof), than the current state of care. This is after you have proven safety (phase I & II trials). The reason why the few new vaccines pass stage three is that showing statistically better results is hard for things where effective vaccines already exist or, if non exists yet, there are very few cases and therefore the statistical significance is not reached in a reasonable amount of time (making it more likely to be a financial loss). \nFor Covid on these two reasons are non-issues. At least for the first couple of vaccines. I'm not sure how this translates to later applications though and I don't think it is a relevant contribution to the resolution of this question. I think here it is a combination of \na) does China consider a diplomatic victory more important than immunising their own population?\nb) does the production capacity suffice to make a) irrelevant b/c they can just supply everyone?\nc) does China think their data would stand up to EMA/FDA scrutiny? I think we can answer a) relatively safely with yes as evidenced by supplications to Indonesia, Turkey and Brazil. Some of that may be due to their own lack of pandemic activity and therefore limited efficacy testability at home, but I do not believe that they didn't also get some kind of concession politically. About b) I'm very unsure, I do not think it is too relevant though as China seems to have the spread \"under control\" by just locking up a few million at a time (it's a sledgehammer but it seems to work).

Third will the EU/US want to approve it. On the first point, I have mainly used the data under clinical trials here. https://www.goodrx.com/blog/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-availability-live-updates/\nThis suggests for a vaccine at the start of clinical trials there is about a 5% chance of getting through and for a vaccine in stage 3 at 20 - 30%. So for at least one of two that would be more like 10% and 36 - 51% if they are \u201cindependent\u201d. These vaccines are all in phase 3 trials somewhere from the news reports. It also seems that so far covid vaccines have done better on phase 3 approvals than the 30% would suggest. It also seems these trials are generally going well, despite one or two incidents (which other vaccines also had). On the flip side these are generally tests in jurisdictions that sound more lax and disinformation from a Chinese company would not be unheard of. In addition, I understand these are vaccines of the same \u201ctype\u201d so may be the results are correlated and these are traditional so the fact that so far covid vaccines have done well may not be relevant. All in, particularly the fact that they might not be \u201cindependent\u201d I am going for 30% at this point for this \u201climb\u201d. I think the Chinese will want EU and/or FDA approval if they can get it. They will want to roll out globally and this will be a stamp of approval as well as a diplomatic victory. They probably would not want to be refused, but that is to an extent filtered out by step 1 above (albeit maybe if it is \u201cclose\u201d they will be cautious). Hard to put a number on this but I am thinking high - 80% for now. Cannot seem to find much on the two companies intentions which would help. Step 3 - it does not look like they stop approving vaccines because they have one, even where the new one is less effective on some measures. People have also stated (from memory) that we will want several vaccines. Let\u2019s call this 85% for now.

If the administration weren\u2019t changing in January, I would have this question at zero for US approval (More of a negative number, Trump would rather poke his eye out with a pencil than allow China to profit off of the virus).  The inherent distrust that has been created this year would color the acceptance by the US on both motives and reliability.  Any distrust of vaccines would be multiplied by a factor of 100 if the vaccine came from within the country where it is perceived to have originated.  This would tend to limit application to the FDA by Chinese firms for two reasons: 1) They do not have a current contract with the US government to purchase the drug, and they are the only ones currently buying. There is no reason to apply without a guarantee of profit.  2) There is a huge non US Market where China could use providing the vaccine as both a source of profit and good will to consolidate its power and prestige. They do not need the hassle of applying in the US.  As far as the EU, after reading through the source materials, I do not see the same antagonism towards China that would make such an approval an issue.  I can see them applying to the EU.  So my estimate is not based upon whether the vaccine works or could be approved if they applied, it is based on whether China would even apply. 5% is probably too high, but I am hedging my bets on this one.

So, 1% for FDA. I wasn't able to find such clear information about the EU, but my prior is that it's similar, and the EU-China trade breakdown shows \"medicaments\" as very very small fraction of EU imports from China [3]. So 20% for EMA (from \"epistemic\" uncertainty more than factual uncertainty). Btw, how did I manage the miracle of googling \"chinese vaccine\" and getting something besides covid19 results? I just set the time range of the search to end on Dec 2019. INSIDE VIEW\nBase rates might be overridden if China was the only game in town. But, there are already ~5 companies with a very big chance of having vaccines approved by March 2021, and another ~5 by September. So I don't see how the Chinese ones would become a priority. EMA hasn't even gotten around to approving Pfizer or Moderna, so they seem even slower than FDA, at least on this, but not by much. One crucial thing that might bring the EMA odds way down is if any decision had to be unanimous by all member states (as so many EU decisions have to be). I would have given EMA 1% odds at best in that case. But they don't have to be unanimous; a majority suffices [4, p.6]. Finally, due to geopolitics, I don't see a way for FDA to approve but not EMA. I feel like FDA would only approve in some very dire scenario that would likely be worldwide (say, several of the now-promising vaccines turn out not to work). So I'll put the FDA 1% in the \"both\" bucket.
