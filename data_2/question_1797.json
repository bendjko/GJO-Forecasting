My previous forecast was Oct 1, 2020 12:08PM. There is nothing like a good stress to test ones forecast.  Since I forecast, Trump got Covid and so has much of the Republican party leaders including 3 members of the Senate judiciary committee. So if there was any event that could trigger any forecast to \"flip\" this should be it. I may not have forecast this exact scenario, but I did consider tail events and took that it into account in my original analysis.  My original forecast said \n\"b) An event happens that slows things down.\nThere is no reason why any external event will slow things down. Even if Covid goes up a lot, the GOP will be very motivated to make sure this happens at full speed. 0% to this countermove.\" So now Covid has happened and it spread much more among Senior Republicans than many could have considered possible. However, despite this the GOP have said they are determined to stick to their original timetable and I still cannot see any logistical hurdle that cannot be overcome by sheer political will as per my original forecast. The logistical hurdles seem to be that an in person vote must take place in the last week of October and 3 Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee have Covid so must self-isolate. Without those 3 votes, the Reps may lose. However, there is nearly a month between them contracting Covid and that vote, so plenty of time for some or all of those Reps to recover in time. Further, there is no legal reason why the vote must be in person. There are political reasons such as \"it's so important that doing it in person rather than online is a must\" yackety yack. Except that not a single Republican genuinely intends to listen to a single word of that hearing. It's all a farce from start to finish with the outcome determined by Trump and Mitch McConnel in advance. The probability of a single senator Rep or Dem being in any way swayed by even the most damning evidential fact is almost 0.  So there is no truthful reason to prevent an absentee or online vote. The Reps therefore can and if necessary will simply change the voting rules. So I can't see how even a shock as large as this will make any difference to the time table, so my forecast remains stable and flip resistant.  My way of judging forecasting accuracy differs a bit from the conventional GJO approach. In addition to Brier, I use an approach I call \"back-testing\".

I observe the impact of the shock in my updated forecast remains what I said it would be in my original forecast.

There is no doubt the Republicans will reject their past principles and elect the new judge. The timing is harder.  Possible moves:\nA) The senate elect the new judge after the election.\nThey can then wait and see who wins. This can give them more legitimacy and they will not be seen going to the electorate just after they have abandoned all their principles for naked political gain. But the new judge will not have a say on the election itself.\nFollow-up moves:\nIf Trump wins and the GOP wins the senate, they will argue a mandate has been granted and will appoint the new judge immediately. They could delay safely, but the mandate means there is no need to do so. They will then immediately appoint the new judge. In addition, by keeping the justice appointment on the ballot, it could motivate conservative voters who were thinking of not voting for Trump but might for the new judge. If Trump wins but the GOP lose the senate, they can still claim a mandate to appoint the new judge and argue they stayed true to their principles. The Dems will dispute it, but they were going to appoint the judge anyway and having some legitimate justification is better than having none.\nIf Trump loses but the GOP keep the senate, the same as above.\nIf Trump loses and the GOP lose the senate, they will at full speed appoint the new judge knowing they can still publicly abandon their principles given the next Senate election is 2 years away. Either way, all roads lead to appointing before 5 January.  B) The senate elect the new judge before the election. They will have the electorial disadvantage of publicly abandoning their principles before a presidential and senate election increasing the chances of them losing both.\nIn return, they get their judge in place to decide any controversial issues on the vote itself, potentially skewing the rules of the game in their favour.\nHowever conservatives turning off Trump will lose their motivation to vote GOP or for Trump, while Democrats will be rallied up for this issue to enable impeachment and expanding the Supreme Court to counter-act this bad behavior. \nIn addition, GOP senators will spend their time in the Senate rather than campaigning, potentially costing them even more.\nThe fact is though that the justices, even the new proposed justice, do seem to have more loyalty to the law than to Trump or the GOP themselves. The idea that they will simply whitewash any case Trump or the GOP throws at them even a case aimed at outright stealing a democratic election I think is low. Instead, the main threat is to abortion and the ACA, not electoral integrity.  But this nuance is lost on Trump and many of the GOP senators. And notwithstanding this, they will still get a slightly more favorable ear for genuine legal disputes as opposed to outright fraud.  Both sides know this is going to the Courts because Trump has refused to respect a democratic vote, so I think the temptation to help the GOP in Court action will be too high and I don't think a legal analysis of the strength of the case they seek to put to the judge has been factored into their thinking. Many of them, Trump in particular, think courts will vote similarly to the way the Senate or the House does. We can now observe if A or B happens, there is no motivation for confirming Amy Barrett after 5 January so we set this outcome to 0%.  The correct move I think is to impose the new judge in the lame duck period because the relative legal advantage of having a \"conservative\" judge in place before the election is small, but the electoral cost will be much higher. However, Trump has very poor political judgment, as does his entire team, and the Senate GOP have been much more zealous recently and probably don't have the power to stop Trump even if they wanted to. And Trump supporters will certainly not see the big picture game and will be angry if the new judge is not in place by election day as they are convinced a conservative judge will always side with the GOP rather than the law. So Trump's team are not strong players and will make mistakes. The evidence shows Trump is pushing the nomination at the fastest possible speed, formally making the nomination by this Saturday. This is the action that could only be motivated by trying to make move B. However, while it keeps B in play, it doesn't rule out A, so it could be simply holding the ball up until a later date before making the final decision. The new Justice is also speedily arranging meetings with Senators, the GOP have made public statements saying they believe they should appoint the new judge as soon as possible. But these statements are still reversible, as they could say as soon as possible means the lame duck period. Conclusion, 5% chance the GOP and Trump will play the optimum move, 95% they are trying to appoint immediately. C) Counter moves\na) GOP and Trump cannot appoint the judge before January if they lose the vote in the Senate. \nThe GOP majority is 53-47. We need 3 to flip. 1 said they will, 1 said they will and seems to be getting cold feet. Nobody else has declared. And the Senate majority leader is acting like he is very confident in getting the numbers.  I give a 2% chance of losing that vote, and 1% chance a second vote will win before January (1% each to both brackets). b) An event happens that slows things down.\nThere is no reason why any external event will slow things down. Even if Covid goes up a lot, the GOP will be very motivated to make sure this happens at full speed. 0% to this countermove. c) A procedural event happens that slows things down.\nThe only thing I can think of is a law case that creates an injunction on the Senate even if temporary. But I can't see any court doing that. The democratically elected chamber has the legitimacy to decide when and how it does its business and its not for the Court to interfere in that without a clear constitutional law being violated.

Although Democrats are still deciding on their tactics for how to handle the situation, they do not hold any silver bullet to stop the train and few options to slow it down. With the books cleared of other legislative issues (other than coronavirus relief), it would appear we are on track for mid-Oct hearings. This would likely set up a floor vote in mid-to-late October. Given the possibility of election court challenges, this would seem to increase the likelihood of a quick nomination. The only possibility for a lame-duck confirmation would likely be from Senators on the ballot in 2020 with close races. Spending time in Washington and not on the campaign trail could cause some concern among those Senators but seems unlikely to slow things down enough to slip pass the elections.
