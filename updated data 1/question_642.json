Using that assumption and an average monthly death for this year of 109, I calculated the probability associated with each bin @ 0%, 21%, and 79%.  2) Using this year's data, I created a series of moving averages of daily deaths with a length equal to the number of remaining days in the period. I then calculated the daily death rate range for each bin and determined the frequency with which rates in those ranges occurred in the data. I used those frequencies as a second set of probabilities @ 4%, 55%, and 40%. 3) I averaged out the results of the previous methods and got probabilities of 2%, 38%, and 60% for the respective categories.  4) Given the number of fatalities that have occurred thus far and the multiple reports of ongoing battles and a worsening security situation, I think there is no chance of less than 40 fatalities this month, so I prorated the probability associated with that bin out to the others, leaving me with 0%, 39%, and 61%"], [15548, "2017-10-12T15:33:40Z", [0.65, 0.3, 0.05], ""], [28414, "2017-10-12T08:28:30Z", [0.0, 0.8, 0.2], ""], [40165, "2017-10-12T05:05:26Z", [0.01, 0.24, 0.75], ""], [5018, "2017-10-12T02:27:20Z", [0.25, 0.5, 0.25], ""], [37239, "2017-10-12T00:08:24Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "Given recorded battle deaths over the last year and the increase over the last three months the target number for October will likely fall in the 200 range."], [38089, "2017-10-11T23:43:31Z", [0.2, 0.5, 0.3], ""], [38627, "2017-10-11T22:34:06Z", [0.22, 0.36, 0.42], ""], [1333, "2017-10-11T21:54:07Z", [0.15, 0.55, 0.3], ""], [12879, "2017-10-11T20:15:52Z", [0.13, 0.75, 0.12], ""], [16851, "2017-10-11T19:56:16Z", [0.1, 0.8, 0.1], ""], [29512, "2017-10-11T19:01:50Z", [0.05, 0.95, 0.0], ""]], "open_date": "2017-10-11T16:00:51Z", "close_date": "2017-11-01T03:59:50Z"}
