He has now called Johnson a coward for not agreeing to appear at the Sky debate and repeated his earlier remark that he would give Johnson \u201cthe fight of his life\u201d [1]  And what would be the motive to step down for Hunt?\n* Get on with the inevitable if he believes it\u2019s better for the country. However, it\u2019s not clear that a quicker election will make that a difference to Brexit given the Oct 31 deadline is so close anyway. \n* Avoid embarrassment from being trounced.

Johnson would have to come under serious heat to consider dropping out due to the fact that he is the overwhelming favorite to win, has been waiting for this moment for over a decade and is notoriously stubborn. Furthermore, he is well known for his eccentric personality and pension to say ridiculous things, thereby and has proven that controversies are hard to stick on him. Hunt is far more likely to drop out of the race due to a controversy or fading chances. However, He has alreadry signalled his willingness to stick it out promising Boris Johnson \"the fight of his life\".

However, with 27 votes, Dominic Raab, might gather enough votes to exceed the threshold of the 2nd round. In this scenario, the remaining four candidates would enter into 2 other elections, in form of postal votes, until only 2 candidates remain. In the final election, the conservative party will decide who of these 2 candidates becomes the new Prime Minister.  The next rounds (non-postal votes) will take place at the 18th, 19th, and 20th of June. However, the last elections will be postal votes and, therefore, will likely require more time.

These members have exactly 1 month to mail in their votes, which means a the new conservative leader and PM will be announced on July 22nd.  However, there are circumstances that could result in a new leader and PM being announced early.  First, similar to the last election the second candidate could stumble due to controversy and withdraw. Second, following preliminary results  a significantly trailing candidate could withdraw. Third, results could be called early due to a vast majority of potential ballots being submitted.   I find these options highly unlikely to result in a new leader being elected before July 1st. This is because from the announcement of the final two candidates, these events would have to happen in a week and it is highly improbable that in a week enough votes will be submitted to warrant calling the election early or to warrant a candidate withdrawing due to them significantly trailing behind.

While Johnson is currently leading the pack, I expect the odds to even out somewhat as more non-Johnson votes go to his contender whoever that may be. A lot of the candidates are Brexiteers who understand the need to neutralize Farage's threat to the Tories, including the most likely contenders (Johnson and Gove), i.e. they disagree not on the overall direction but on substantive details in strategy and competency. This points against a clear cut case in which one candidate is preferred and the other drops out.

She will be stepping down from her role on the 7th of June. This creates the demand for another PM to be nominated as early as possible.  According to the BBC, the Conservative Party announced the likely timetable for the leadership contest was that nominations would close during the week beginning 10 June, with candidates whittled down by the end of the month. Furthermore, as the next general election in the United Kingdom is scheduled to be held on 5 May 2022 under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, it is required that the next person to take up the difficult job of delivering Brexit as Prime Minister will have to be a Tory, who are now holding the majority of the seats at Westminster.  Given these facts, I am 90% certain that someone new among the Tories will be appointed in the 30-day interval between her scheduled resignation and the forecasted date. EDIT: I have read the forecasts below and people seem to be concerned that the 30 days will not suffice. However, I would like to point out that David Cameron announced that he would resign the office of Prime Minister on 24 June and stepped down on the 13th of July, the same date as Theresa May assumed office, which is less than 3 weeks from the announced resignation under similar circumstances.

The media are now expecting a more reasonable 12 candidates instead of the 20 they have been talking about for a while.

I believed that the Conservative Party had already a plan B, especially since the situation of emergency and the need for new a leader to lead the UK out (or in) the EU.

May finally gave in and will resign as Conservative party leader at the 7th of June. The internal contest in the Conservative party, deciding who will succeed May, will start at the 10th of June. It seems unlikely that the new PM will be chosen quickly as there are several Tory politicians who already declared their interest and many more who might run for PM as well. Another factor which decreases the likelihood for a fast transition is the factional divide within the Conservative party (Soft vs. Hard Brexit supporters) as it further increases the effort it takes for one candidate to gather enough votes behind him/her. The BBC estimates that a new PM will be in place by end of July. Also, the Guardian states that the internal contest \u201cis expected to last perhaps six weeks\u201d.    However, there are also arguments in favour of a quick change which could result in a new conservative PM before the 1st of July. First of all, the transition from Cameron to May, after the former had stepped down, only took 17 days. This seems less likely if one considers the worsened party coherence due to the tough Brexit negotiations which also took place within the Conservative party. A new PM will need to convince his fellow party members that he/she is able to find a compromise. Something which seems like a Hercules task at this point. Another argument for a quick transition could be that the Conservatives will try to avoid instability in their party and in UK as well. A fast election process could display symbolic unity, something the party lacked during the last year. However, regarding the mentioned circumstances, this seems unlikely, too.  Considering all the stated arguments it is necessary to adjust the forecast accordingly. The option \u201cNo\u201d will remain the most probable. Nevertheless, it will be reduced regarding that there are good arguments which support a fast transition. As a result, the probabilities will be distributed in the ratio 2:1 in favour of \u201cNo\u201d new PM before the 1st of July. A more decisive forecast wouldn\u2019t take into account the involved uncertainties, such as backdoor negotiations within the conservative party, at this point of time.

Hence, I looked to  the 2016 contest that followed Cameron's post-referendum resignation.  He announced he was stepping back on June 24th, the 1922 announced the official beginning of the leadership vote on June 27th and by July 11th May wins the leadership vote and takes office on July 13th. Hence, the whole leadership was changed in just 17 days. Should the 2019 contest follow this pattern, a new Prime Minister could indeed take office before July 1st , as May would officially step down.  However, it has been highlighted that while a leadership contest has been ready to commence for a while, with candidates gearing up for campaigning, this one will be a lot longer than the 2016 one. The Conservative party is in extreme crisis and very fractured. While there are favorites to take over for May, there isn't one clear candidate and the process could take a while longer due to the many potential candidates and the need to VERY CAREFULLY contemplate a new leader and the future of the Conservative party. This has led some to report that a new leader could be in place my mid-July.  Evidently, I am still very uncertain about how it will progress from here and I will be keeping close attention to the happenings in the conservative party and attempt to understand the process a little better.

While this is unlikely, and some have suggested it could take as little as few weeks, a selection of a leader in the face of a Brexit decision may draw out beyond July 1. As the new PM will be instrumental in Brexit negotiations and it's future, and the party having been divided on how Brexit should look, I see the leadership contest dragging out for at least three weeks (just as decisions on Brexit have dragged out). This would effectively leave May as PM on July 1. Still a possibility though, is a rapid decision to secure some stability in the party. 35% has been given to this option to account for such an event, while 65% has been given to the more likely scenario that a new PM has not yet been selection on July 1.

In the past days, Conservative voices have been ever louder in their criticism of May\u2019s leadership.  Allegedly,  Conservative party members met to discuss a vote to change the party rules that has secured May since her last vote of no confidence. May is set to meet with the 1922 committee tomorrow, Friday May 24th, to discuss the future of the Conservative party leadership. The committee has previously called for her resignation. \nWhile May has weathered many challenges and internal criticism, it seems the pressure for her resignation is more profound and widespread than previously. An end to May\u2019s run as prime minister could be near!  However, even if May did commit to stepping down in the near future \u2013 dates like June 6th, 7th and 10th have been proposed, - it begs the question, if a new Conservative leader would be ready to take over before July 1st? (The idea that May would step down before seems very unlikely considering the American state visit scheduled for June 3rd.) Around May\u2019s last vote of confidence, it was reported that a leadership contest in the Conservative party could take up to 12 weeks, while expected to be quicker in the current state of affairs. However, it seems unlikely that the process could be condensed to just 3 weeks and allow a new Conservative prime minister to take office before July 1st. Some sources have reported that if May agrees to resign in early June, the leadership contest is set to commence in July, thereby not leaving time for a leadership change before the end of June.  While May could step down as head of the conservative party, and not actually leave the position as prime minister, this is a very unlikely scenario, as it is not what the parliament have been calling for! Additionally, May could step down as both leader of the conservative party and prime minister without a new Tory leader waiting to step up. This would require an interim prime minister which is extremely rare and also rather unlikely. (Moreover, would an interim prime minister count as an actual \u2018new prime minister\u2019 as the question asks?) .  Hence, while I recognize that these days are crucial for May\u2019s continued time in office, and that the situation could be pointing towards a resignation, it still seems unlikely that a new prime minister will take office before July 1st.

A general election won\u2019t take place before the 1 of July anymore (due to the fixed time periods; see earlier forecast). As a result, this forecast will adjust the probability for a new Labour PM to 0%.  The only left alternatives would be that:  a) Theresa May steps down before the 1st of July. This is difficult to estimate as May has been demonstrating her willingness to continue for the last years despite the tough Brexit negotiations and heavy pressure from her own party. However, May proposed to her party that she will step down if they back her new withdrawal agreement. This could be interpreted as fatigue, but also as another try to unite her coalition and lure them into supporting her bill. May\u2019s proposal won\u2019t be published until early June due to the Whitsun recess of the Parliament (which ends at the 4th of June). The \u201csecond reading\u201d (first debate on proposal) is vaguely planned for the 7th of June according to government whip Mark Spencer. Some conservative MPs and party members, known as the \u201cbackbench 1922 Committee\u201d, held a secret ballot to alter internal party rules in order to initiate another no confidence vote against May if she won\u2019t step down until the 10th of June. The pressure on May is increasing steadily, though the next days will show if this pressure decreases due to the recess or if it sustains. Nevertheless, the probability for this sub-option will be changed to 10% regarding the involved high uncertainties if May is fatigued enough or not; or b) a no-confidence motion will be passed in the Parliament and an alternative Tory government is able to win the confidence vote within a 14 calendar days period (very unlikely due to internal divide of the Conservative party and the Whitsun recess of the Parliament). As a result, this sub-option (b) should be assessed with a 0% probability.

Hence, regardless of the extinction of article 50 by the EU until October, the Brexit process in now in an impasse. Today the European Elections are taking place in Britain and,  according to the polls, it will be the worst result in the Conservative Party history (https://yougov.co.uk/topics/voting-intention/all).

Dividing the two gives a probability of \u2248 19% that a prime minister will change a given year and 81% probability that it will not happen. Since the scope of the question is less that 2 months the estimate ends up at \u2248 4% probability of change before 1 of July 2019, if we were talking about an \"average\" prime minister.  Looking at the specifics of the UK right now it is reasonable to assume that there is a higher probability because of the Brexit process.  Theresa May has publicly stated that she will not continue as prime minister after Brexit is over, so it is a matter of WHEN not IF. Since Brexit have been postponed until October 2019, and the process still appears to be in a deadlock, I don't think this increases the probability of a new prime minister before July by much more than 2-4% on its own. This number reflects the probability of a Brexit agreement before July. (https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/16/world/europe/uk-theresa-may.html) The leader of Labour, Jeremy Corbyn, recently left negotiations of a Brexit compromise with Theresa May blaming their inability to reach agreement. (https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/world/europe/jeremy-corbyn-theresa-may.html). Yet another blow to Theresa May.  On the other hand, there are some things favouring her remaining as prime minister up until the point where the agreement is reached. In a podcast by Danish media Altinget several sources report that a large group in the Conservative Party fears that the replacement will be much worse, such as Boris Johnson. He is likely much more willing to accept the no-deal scenario and just leave.  Dividing the remaining probability between the other three options, the actual outcome of Brexit will have a massive impact upon which party can get the position of prime minister. Since this is an unknown, I have simply given them all equal amounts except for the \"other\" option.

Therefore, even though she is protected till the end of the year, she's recently announced that she'll set an election timetable for a new conservative party leader if her deal fails again in June. Her deal is expected to be brought up again beginning in June, but when the actual vote happens isn't known yet. I believe that her deal will fail once again, because it has failed three other times before, there is now no imminent drop out day looming about MPs and conservatives have now been promised that they can get rid of Theresa May if they reject her deal. This means May would have to get the Labour party on board and negotiations with Jeremy Corbyn and Labour leaders have esstentially stalled with Corbyn claiming that talkks \"have gone as far as they can\". Therefore, it's highly unlikely may will get Labour support.  For these reasons I am I find that Theresa May's deal will almost undoubtedly fail,  thereby triggering conservative party elections. However, if may's deal passes  then she'll continue to be PM at least till July 1st 2019. So whether May leaves by July 1st is really a question on how long leadership elections will take. First and foremost, according to conservative  party rules, the resigning PM will remain PM throughout the elections. Therefore, May's resignation announcement will not actually be the date she leaves office, that date will be when the conservative party chooses their new leader. So to look at dates, May's deal will first come to Parliament on June 3rd, but the likelihood it is voted on immediately is very low. however, it isn't unreasonable to assume that a vote on it will happen by Friday June 7th. So let's assume it fails on June 7th and May then works over the weekend with conservative leaders ans announces her resignation and subsequent timetable for elections on Monday June 10th. From here there are then 3 weeks till Friday June 28th for elections be held and completed for May to cease to be PM by July 1st. Moreover, it'll actually be less than three weeks, because of the nomination process, which normally takes a few days.  For the most part, conservative leaders have allotted a 2 month timetable for election, but rarely is all this time used. In fact leadership election usually take around a month. Thereby, placing May's resignation date eerily close to July 1st. An important aspect of this election procedure is that it is not first past the post, but rather is a succession of run off elections, where the lowest vote getter is eliminated until only two candidates remain and then in this final election is determined by a majority vote. Therefore, a candidate could be getting over 50% of the vote, but will continue to go through elections till they are only facing one other candidate. This system has the has probability of prolonging election over three weeks and into July if there are numerous, stubborn candidates.  Theresa May's assumption to office took just under 3 weeks after Cameron's resignation announcement. However, Theresa May was the clear choice and gained 50% of the vote on the first ballot while running against 4 other opponents and received 60% of the vote on the second ballot while running against 2 other candidates and then four days after her primary opponent dropped out and two days after that Cameroon formally resigned.  Based on this very generous and fast election data, it can be assumed that a round of voting will take 1 week. Therefore, in order for Theresa May to leave office by July 1st there would have to be at maximum 2 rounds of voting, with the possibility of 3 just barely making it in time for a resignation before July 1st.  Therefore, whether Theresa May leaves before July 1st is a question of the number of candidates running for PM, how evident the eventual winner is and how stubborn the other candidates are. At this point in time there do not seem to be any clear choices, as May quickly became when Cameron announced his resignation. Therefore,  I predict that there will be a myriad of candidates and that some of these like Boris Johnson, who has already announced his candidacy, will be very stubborn and won't simply drop out. For these Reason I predict that this election process will require, at minimum 3 rounds of voting. This also isn't unreasonable to conceive, because every conservative leadership election since 1997 till May required 3 rounds or more and the election in 2016 was heading into a 3rd round before May's primary opponent dropped out.  Due to this reasoning, I believe that conservative PM elections will run just barely into July, thereby meaning that May will continue to be PM by July 1st. However, it isn't impossible for her to formally resign before then. There a couple of factors are important to consider that could make this happen. First, May's deal could be voted on in parliament earlier than the June 7th I proposed. May could not drag her feet and already have election plans, thereby announcing elections the day the deal fails or sooner than I predicted. During the election process a clear leader could emerge and a fractured conservative party could come together to swiftly elect a new leader. because of these reasons, I give a 15% probability that May will cease to be PM by July 1st 2019. https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-48290760\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-48304867\nhttps://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/conservative-party-leadership-contests\nhttps://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN01366 "], [73519, "2019-05-17T10:36:07Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [73518, "2019-05-17T10:25:33Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [73516, "2019-05-17T10:18:36Z", [0.2, 0.09, 0.01, 0.7], "Votes on the Brexit bill are due to be made for a 4th time on June 3rd, which can be reasonably expected to fail, and local tory associations are expected to register a vote of no confidence in the PM on June 15th.  \nThe Pm has already suggested she would announce a time table for resigning should the vote on the 3rd fail, meaning she is likely to be leaving.\nHowever she may string out announcing resignation until the results of the 15th tory assoc vote of no confidence, and will likely take a couple of days after the 4th meaningful vote before she makes any formal announcement.\nAssuming the announcement comes towards the end of the week, this leaves only 3 weeks for a successory to be appointed, the party to canvas its members and vote, or for a GE.

Her supporters believe that elections for the European Parliament, scheduled for next week, will be bad news for both the Conservative and opposition Labour parties but hope that could help Mrs. May. They argue that, if Mr. Farage\u2019s Brexit Party performs well, it proves that voters are frustrated at Parliament\u2019s failure to agree on a plan to leave the European Union, which could increase pressure on lawmakers to pass Mrs. May\u2019s Brexit legislation.

Within her Conservative Party, activists are planning to hold a meeting on June 15 to discuss a motion of no confidence in Mrs. May. While nonbinding, that would be a huge blow to what remains of her authority. Senior lawmakers have threatened to change internal party rules that protect her from a formal challenge until December. That could mean her having to face a quick contest that she would probably lose. Rather than risk that fate, Mrs. May appears to have finally accepted that a fourth parliamentary failure would make her position untenable.\n. . . \n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  I don't know how things work in the UK well enough to know what happens if the PM loses a vote of confidence in her party, and how long it takes before there might be a new PM.  @KitsonJ, @Tetbury, @dsarin, @IanPitchford, @nigster"], [73423, "2019-05-17T03:15:17Z", [0.7, 0.2, 0.05, 0.05], "There\u2019s a trend towards conservative currently.

Many Conservatives are said to think that if she goes before the EU Parliamentary Election 23rd May that would be a much needed boost for Conservative candidates. But if she goes before or after the election, as far as this question is concerned, the important issue is if she is pushed by her own MPs to resign immediately or she just agrees to resign asap. \nWhen Cameron resigned replacing him with May took just under 3 weeks, but this time there is likely to be a lot more candidates, so whittling down to two will presumably take at least a few days more. And in 2016 after the MPs had reduced the candidates to 2, the other candidate (Leadsom) pulled out. If the full election process had been followed I thing it would have taken over a week and more like two weeks to have organised the required vote for all party members. So I would guess that from May announcing she was resigning to a new PM taking over would take it would probably take at least 5 or 6 weeks. There is less than 7 weeks until this question ends. \nIt would be possible to do it faster, but presumably they would be more interested in making sure the next PM was the best person, than they would in rushing the process. \nThe other possibility would be installing a temporary PM (who would be the new PM as far as this question is concerned) to give more time to choose the permanent replacement, but I don't see what the point would be. A temporary PM would not have authority to do anything apart from maintaining the status quo (and the EU would not want to negotiate Brexit with him/her).\nIt could be close but if May resigns this week there is a 50% chance there will be a New Conservative PM before 1st July and for every day after that the chances drop by about 1%. We will soon find out, but Mrs May will probably last long enough that a replacement is not in office until after the end of June. \n(There is probably no rush, because if a new PM fancies a different EU WA that has been agreed already with the EU I doubt that the EU would be able to renegotiate before November and to do that A50 woud need to be delayed again.

Its more likely she won't resign but announce a date (or event) when she will resign and that will trigger an internal election in the Conservative Party which would probably mean a new PM not taking over until after the end date of this question.  If May refuses to resign there will be a delay while the Conservatives argue about changed their internal rules so they can sack her. This could just about be done before July, but I suspect that many Conservative MPs would be unhappy changing the rules, so nothing will happen until the question closes. (They are called the Conservative Party after all). The other issue that will put off Conservatives sacking Mrs May is concern about who would replace her in the long term. Its very possible that Conservative Party members could elect a new Leader that does not have the confidence of enough MPs (of all parties) to form a government.

With the extension of the deadline to October 2019 it seems very unlikely that she will leave the government before the 1 of July 2019. Considering the obstacles which Theresa May had to deal with (no confidence votes, historical defeat in the parliament & etc.) she has proven that she is able to handle the pressure and the lack of support by her own party. For this reason, this forecast will solely focus on the support and opposition Theresa May faces by MPs as potential actors capable of forcing her to step down. Therefore, the forecast at hand will assess the party discipline among parties as the decisive factor which enables the success or failure of potential no confidence votes.  Theresa May won the confidence vote within her party in December 2018, however 117 members of her party voted against her. Another no confidence vote triggered by conservative MPs cannot take place before December 2019. The motion of no confidence in January, proposed by Labour, wasn\u2019t successful neither. Nonetheless, its outcome was a devastating symbolic result for May as she only won by 19 votes with 325 to 306 in her favour due to the support of her party and her coalition partner DUP. Labour might still try to get rid of May through a no confidence vote which would trigger a general election. It is worth to mention, that the remaining time until the end of this forecast may be enough for staging a successful no confidence vote, however, it seems extremely unlikely that a new PM will be elected by this time regarding the amount of time necessary to proceed and finalize a general election in the UK. The following scenario will exemplify how little time is left: a successful no confidence vote tomorrow (10.05.2019; this is very unlikely itself) against the government than would start a 14 calendar days countdown which will expire at the 23rd of May. During this time an alternative government must win a confidence vote. From the 23rd to the 4th of June the Parliament won\u2019t have any sittings due to recess. In the case that none of the alternative governments will succeed (very likely; see below) there has to be a new general election which can take place no earlier than 25 working days after the first time period expired. This means, in the case of a successful no confidence vote at the 10th of May the earliest possible date for a general election, given that no alternative government won the confidence vote until the 23rd of May, will be the 27th of June. The last day for a successful confidence vote in order to get a new PM before the 1st of July, under similar circumstances as before, is the 13th of May. As a result, the parliament has to vote in favour for a no confidence motion in the next two working days in order to appoint a new PM before the 1st of July. As there are no significant indicators which would imply such a move it is relative safe to forecast a 90% likelihood that Theresa May will remain PM until the 1st of July. It is worth to mention that the 1st of July is an arbitrary boundary and, thus, won\u2019t have any effect on the MPs voting decision. The remaining 10% derive from the unlikely possibility that May will step down by herself (see above) or that she will be unable to continue her term as PM. The following analysis should be understood as an estimation to identify which party would be able to appoint the next PM under in such circumstances.  For May the weakened party discipline results in a situation where the slightest disagreement with a conservative MP is synonymic with another lost vote to back her up. It puts the pressure on her to be responsible for maintaining and monitoring the loyalty of each MP of her own party. Therefore, she depends on the support within the parliament more than other PMs before her. Unfortunately for her, the current controversy regarding the Brexit has a negative effect on May\u2019s internal support within the conservative party. The party is split in two major factions: Tories who back May and her Brexit deal and the ones who insist on a hard Brexit and oppose her deal. This latter bloc is one of the main reasons why May\u2019s deal didn\u2019t succeed in the past. However, this bloc still supports May to some extend in order to avoid any possibility for Labour to trigger a new general election. The rise of Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party may further consolidate the loyalty of this bloc to May in order to avert new elections which may allow Farage\u2019s party to gain voters from their constituencies. Regardless, May cannot make to many concessions to them as she risks losing the support of Tories and Labours favouring a soft Brexit in the parliament. This internal factional divide in the conservative party makes it very unlikely that one of the blocs will be able to appoint a new PM out of their ranks which is able to gather enough support across the party nor that they will form a coalition to overthrow May together.  Labour on the other hand isn\u2019t in a good spot neither. The Labour party also got split in two halves: one bloc supports Jeremy Corbyn who is in favour of a soft Brexit, while the other bloc opposes their party leader as they prefer to remain in the EU. In the no confidence motion in January Labour voted against May in unity. Nevertheless, this doesn\u2019t mean that Corbyn can rely on the support of all Labour members to get backed up in his attempt to become the next PM. Similar to the conservative party, the newly formed factional divide might prevent a coherent support for one Labour MP to become the next PM in the current heated situation. However, Labour, despite also losing support in recent local elections, benefits from the Brexit as the government, or the Conservative party, is mostly held responsible for its disappointing progression by voters. As a result, it seems more likely that Labour will appoint the next PM in the unlikely event of a successful no confidence vote.  Due to the first-past-the-post-system in the UK, it seems extremely unlikely (less than 1%) that the next PM will be a member of another party. Despite recent gains in the local vote, these other parties are still to small (or characteristically unable to gain a wide support in the UK; e.g.: SNP or DUP). It is also very unlikely that Tories and Labour would choose someone from another party even if there are sporadically new cross-party alliances due to the Brexit.  Note on reference class and base rates: \nThe Brexit itself is a novelty in international politics. It is less the nature of the overall process which is new. States separated from their former supranational structure at the end of the Cold War era at a time when more and more former Soviet republics detached themselves from the USSR. However, the Brexit shouldn\u2019t be seen in this context as it represents a process in which a democratic state is detaching itself from a democratic organization (or community) while still trying to maintain close ties in areas such as the economy. Also, this separation doesn\u2019t take place within a national context of revolution or at least strong reformism, but instead happens within an institutionalized framework and in collaboration with the entity the state is separating from. Therefore, it doesn\u2019t make sense to compare base rates of former presidents and prime ministers in ex-soviet states during these times with Theresa May as references.

A coronation is unlikely next time around as the centrist and right wing factions are vying for supremacy. May has given no indication of imminent intent to resign, and has previously vowed to see the Withdrawal Agreement through parliament before she goes.

Last week\u2019s announcement drew immediate outrage from the British public, of which nearly 70 percent disapproves of the president, as well as in the British Parliament, which the president is currently banned from addressing. In the United States, it did not land any lighter as Trump took to Twitter the next day to accuse British intelligence services of spying on him. The cracks in the special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom are clear. Although they may start with the president\u2019s personality, they do not end there.

It seems like a long run. However, with all the opposition (even from the party she is the leader of) and her public approval ratings constantly sinking to the lowest numbers, we can assume that she won\u2019t be able to last long as a prime minister even though once she was perceived as \u201cone of the most popular Prime Ministers in the modern era\u201d. I assume that she will resign in the upcoming months, but not before the 1st of July 2019 due to the fact that she is not going to leave before Brexit is finally fulfilled. May has announced that she is not ready to delay Brexit any further than June 30, that might leave us with a possibility of her resigning before July 1 \u2013 one of the main reasons I gave the options of someone from either from the Conservative Party or the Labor Party to take over in total 20%.  However, the EU leaders are not in favor of that idea, since there\u2019s no deal achieved and the final result of Brexit most likely will still be unclear before July 1.  Another challenge for May might be the results of her party \u2013 the conservative party \u2013 at the European Parliament elections. Since the UK is still component of the above-mentioned elections, that is held on the 23rd of May of 2019 in the UK and the party was not happy about holding it in the first place, we can assume that they are not properly prepared for the elections. Besides, it is quite obvious that the ongoing process of Brexit is going to have a huge impact on the results. Hence, if the results are hideous, she might lose even more supporters. But again, the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union has been delayed until the 31st of October and without knowing concrete plan of actions, I believe that May will not resign. Moreover, for the past few months we have witnessed May experiencing significant failures, most importantly the MPs rejecting all of her options for Brexit, but she still remains the prime minister of the UK. Hence, after all the dramatic events, she has proven to have the ability of keeping the position.  Moreover, in September the Conservative Party will hold an annual conference, which is an opportunity for the members of parliament to choose two candidates and announce the winner if May resigns few weeks before the conference.

Therefore, there will not be another vote of no-confidence by July 1st 2019 (https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/24/theresa-may-survives-attempt-to-allow-early-no-confidence-vote). Nor will there be an election, because the Prime Minister is in control of calling early elections and she has already indicated she will not do this, nor would it make any political sense for her to do this. Therefore, there will not be another prime minister from a different party by July 1st 2019. Therefore, the only foreseeable way that there will be a new Prime Minister is if Theresa May willingly steps down. She has already claimed that if the UK were to participate in EU elections she would step down, but since the EU announcement of the extension till October 31st she has since been rolling back that claim. She has also shown extraordinary resilience and persistence in the face of tremendous opposition and criticism which makes me believe she will stick it through at least until July 1st, but there remains a small chance she could willingly step down.

UK PM Theresa May and EU leaders negotiated a delay in March and April 2019 for UK withdrawal from EU, but later the deadline extended to October 2019. In the meantime, Theresa May has stated her intention to resign as PM once the UK withdraws itself from EU successfully. The bill would have to pass through both lower House of Commons and upper House of Lords to ratify the deal and leave the EU, and the UK need to take part in the European elections in terms of the EU membership on May 23. If Parliament cannot agree on a deal soon and the UK does not take part in the European elections on 23 May, then a no-deal would happen on 1st June. If the elections take place, then the final line is 31st October. Thus, the UK would have to leave the EU in June without a deal.  There are some hurdles that could make her fall. May 2 2019, the local elections provide the most imminent opportunity for voters, and a bad result could force her to resign. \nMay 23 2019, the UK is forced to hold elections for the European Parliament, they present another chance for voters to give the government a kicking the PM would find difficult to survive.  Theresa May once confirmed that she\u2019s not prepared to delay Brexit any further than 30 June. She has asked the EU for an extension to article 50 until 30 June, and that date appears as the likely possible departure. However, along this lane, other possibilities emerged and showed that if she survived from the next wave, there is no point to force her to leave by her party until December, which under the Conservative Party rules. If she insists her resign aftermath, the Conservative leadership campaign will result in the appointment of a new prime minister.

Indeed, in this specific case, I think that focusing too much on every tiny detail creates confusion and makes losing the global overview of the event. On the 11th Eu and UK agreed on delaying Brexit to October 31st. According to May\u2019s purpose of ensuring the smoothest possible Brexit, I increase my expectation that May will remain Prime Minister at least until 1st July. Brexit is May's career main goal and the reason of its office.\nHowever, the possible scenarios are the following:\n- In my previous forecast I talked about the possibility of an agreement between Corbyn (Labour party) and May. If the agreement is reached before the EU elections (1), MPs vote on it. If it passes (1.1) the UK would negotiate a modified Brexit deal with the EU to make the UK leave as soon as possible (however, there is no evidence the new agreement proposals will be accepted by the EU). If it doesn\u2019t (1.2) \uf0e0go to point (2.2)\n- If the agreement is not reached (2) the MPs would vote other options: if they find an alternative agreement (2.1) \uf0e0 go to 1.1, if they don\u2019t find any alternative compromise (2.2) they should decide to take part or not to the EU election. According to the fact that the UK participation was a not avoidable condition for the extension of the art.50, if it won\u2019t be respected, Brexit will have to leave with no deal on 1st June (2.2.1). If UK participates to the elections (2.2.2) a lot of scenario could take place: go back to the approval of May\u2019s deal, re-start negotiations, referendum, cancel the Brexit, general election, no-deal. I think that in all these cases May will conduct the process as Prime Minister (we said a soft Brexit is her aim), except for cases 2.2.1 and maybe 1.1: if UK leaves with no-deal I think May would resign after the Brexit \uf0e0 new prime minister before 1st July. Also, the UK Parliament has rejected the idea of a No-deal, which will be supported by the Labour and by all the MP against a hard Brexit, so I think that scenario 2.2.1. is unlikely to occur.\nHowever, we should also consider that May has expressed her will of avoiding EU elections, so I expect efforts from her to reach an agreement before the end of June. In this scenario she will maybe resign, but I see it very unlikely to occur, because of the previous divergences. To me, the most likely scenarios as the 2.2.2, which would open various possibilities. \n- I think that the no-Brexit MP will take advantages for this extension of article 50 to re-shape the public opinion about the referendum. So far, I\u2019ve said that I see the launch of a new referendum as anti-democratic and politically masochist (look at my old forecast about Brexit), but I don\u2019t exclude it to happen. Indeed, the chaos in the UK Parliament and the continuous delays could pressure citizens to remain in the EU. Also, recent events like the disorder in Belfast can make people re-think about their choice. However, the whole preparation for the hypothetical referendum like the definition of the rules and of the question in the legislation, the campaign takes time (experts at UCL Constitution Unit suggest that the minimum time for all of the required steps is about 22 weeks). I believe May would handle this process, therefore, wouldn\u2019t leave her office before 1st July.\n- Labour could table another no confidence motion at any time. If the government loses the vote starts a 14-days countdown: If during that time the current government or any other alternative government cannot win a new vote of confidence, then an early general election would be called. Also, the election cannot occur for at least 25 working days. In this case I think that May wouldn\u2019t participate to the new election, but it\u2019s unlikely to happen before 1st July. Indeed, 14+25=39 days, plus some days to announce the new elections and vote (I would say, minimum one week). This means that the whole process should start at least around half may and anyway wouldn\u2019t leave time to the new prime minister to take office. Moreover, the current government already survived a vote of no confidence on 16 January by 325 votes to 306, which pulls away the possibility of a new vote of confidence.  In conclusion, I don\u2019t think drastic and immediate measures related to no deal would take place, I see more likely other scenarios which implies a longer time to reach a final solution. In this prospective, from my analysis appears that May will remain in charge at least until 1st July. Let\u2019s see what happen after the Easter break, during which the MP were on holidays (except for May negotiators). https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46393399\nhttps://www.ilpost.it/tag/brexit/\nhttps://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1114032/Brexit-news-Theresa-May-Nigel-Farage-Easter-latest "], [14667, "2019-04-22T09:00:35Z", [0.02, 0.0, 0.0, 0.98], ""], [72552, "2019-04-22T08:56:40Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "She would stay on to see through Brexit "], [72553, "2019-04-22T08:41:25Z", [0.13, 0.35, 0.0, 0.52], "Theresa has enjoyed a sunny walk in Wales over Easter and realises her life as PM is futile - 13% or, more likely, she remains stubbornly attached to power 52% or something unpredictable and  bad happens forcing a general election and labour wins 35%"], [72549, "2019-04-22T07:03:49Z", [0.3, 0.1, 0.0, 0.6], "No reason for conservatives to call general election and although PM is unpopular I think potential new Tory leaders would rather we were out of EU then pick up the mantle"], [72546, "2019-04-22T04:43:08Z", [0.1, 0.05, 0.05, 0.8], ""], [72541, "2019-04-22T02:33:40Z", [0.85, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05], "Brexit has been a disaster so May will be ousted.

However this is pretty unlikely given that they haven't been able to agree to a deal yet, so what could change within the next two months? At the same time, it seems like EVERYTHING can change in two months now a days.  I'm pretty unclear about what party will take over after May, but given some recent polling it looks like the Brexit party is doing the best, second is the Labour and third is the conservative, so I have spit my percentages accordingly. https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2019/04/brexit-party-s-poll-lead-scary-tories-worse-remainers"], [72459, "2019-04-19T18:13:06Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [67423, "2019-04-19T17:46:54Z", [0.2, 0.0, 0.0, 0.8], "Considering the current situation, it seems that May\u2019s future as PM is very much dependent on whether or not a Brexit deal is agreed upon before UK\u2019s scheduled EP elections on May 23rd.  As with any forecast related to Brexit, it is a difficult prediction to make and there are few prerequisites that are worth establishing: \n-\tTheresa May has previously declared that she will resign as soon as her Brexit deal has been delivered. It is assumed this apply to any Brexit deal.\n-\tThe Fix- parliaments act regulates when elections will occur: Elections are to be held every 5th year, unless parliament vote for no confidence in government or a vote of 2/3 of house of commons want a general election. \n-\tIn the wake of a no confidence vote, any MP has the right to attempt to assemble a majority in parliament and form a new government within 2 weeks. \n-\tAfter an election is called, it is to be held within 25 working days. \n-\tIn accordance with the Conservative Party rules, May cannot be forced from her position by her own party \ntill December 2019, as she has recently survived the no confidence vote.   The UK has been granted an extension on article 50 till October 31st 2019. This extension is dependent upon the UK holding EP elections on May 23rd, unless they manage to agree on a Brexit deal before this date. In case the UK fails to secure a Brexit deal and do not hold the EP elections, they are forced to leave the EU on June 1st without a deal.  Theresa May and other MPs have on several occasions expressed their desire to avoid British participation in the EP election. Consequently, they will be working very hard to secure a Brexit deal before this date. In case they do secure a deal before May 23rd, it is expected that May will resign immediately following this. May\u2019s resignation will, in turn, initiate a leadership contest within the Conservative party to elect a new party leader and PM. In this scenario, a new conservative PM could take office before July 1st.  However, as the parliament has repeatedly failed to secure a deal, it is unlikely that they will manage to do so before May 23rd. While some conservative MPs might be pushed to support May\u2019s deal in a last bid to avoid the EP election, most pro-EUs are even less likely to support a deal and instead utilize the EP elections as a means to showcase the continued support for Britain in the EU. As May, and a majority of parliament, have expressed their commitment to avoid a hard Brexit, May will most likely hold the EP elections to avoid just that. If the EP elections are held, May will most likely not leave her position as PM and she will instead remain in office to continue her work to secure a deal before October 31st.  Should the EP elections be held, parliament could initiate yet another \u2018vote of no confidence\u2019 to attempt to overturn the Conservative government. In accordance with the \u2018fix parliament act\u2019, this would allow for any MP to seek to establish a majority and form a new government within 2 weeks. However, due to the current chaotic nature of British politics, it is very unlikely that anyone would be able to achieve this. This would result in a general election 25 workings days later. A time horizon of 14 days + 25 days would not leave enough time for a new PM to take office before July 1st. Moreover, since WWII, only one government has been brought down by vote of \u2018no confidence in government\u2019. Theresa May and her government survived a no confidence vote in January 2019.  It is very unlikely that a Brexit deal will be reached closely after the EP elections. The elections will most likely instead result in calls for another referendum, re-negotiations etc.  In conclusion, whether a new prime minister takes office before July 1st seems to be mostly dependent upon whether a deal is secured before the EP elections or not. In case the parliament manages to secure a deal within the foreseeable future, Theresa May will most likely step down and another Conservative will take over. However, as of now, it seems unlikely that a deal will be reached. This will result in EP elections and after those, May will likely only leave office if she loses a \u2018no confidence vote\u2019. But in the case of a no confidence vote, a new PM will not be in office before July 1st. It seems very unlikely that either someone from either Labour or another party will become PM before July 1st.

There was much of doubt if May remains in the office back to the period of December - January when May was facing a vote of confidence in her leadership of the Conservative Party as well as a vote of no confidence in her government. However, many things have changed. Looking from today's perspective, May time in the office mostly depends on the future of Brexit deal. As she said herself, she will leave the Prime Minister's post as soon as the agreement will be achieved between the UK and EU. On 11th April, EU and UK agreed to delay Brexit to October 31st. Therefore, it is very likely that she remains Prime Minister until then.  15% (14+1) - As one of the EU conditions to delay the Brexit was an obligation for the UK to hold the EU Parliament Election. As now it is only a matter of time when the UK leaves the EU, many Brexiteers are angry about participating in elections at all, seeing it as only a waste of time and money. In addition, May herself made a statement that the UK can still leave before 22 May, if Parliament backs the withdrawal agreement she reached with the EU. In this case, the UK could also avoid EU elections. if Parliament agrees with May's Brexit deal - May has already decided to leave the office and, therefore, a new Prime Minister will have to be elected. As Tories are quite confident at leading the polls, it is a high probability that the Prime Minister would also be a conservative. Due to the unavoidable uncertainty, I gave 1 % of chance to Labour candidate even though I find it hard to imagine that someone from the Labour Party would lead the process of UK exiting the EU.\nHowever, looking at the previous UK parliament's votes when all possible Brexit solutions were rejected, it is considered very unlikely that Parliament somehow would switch their support towards May's deal in less than two months. Therefore, the chances of the UK and EU to reach an agreement and May to be replaced before July, are quite small.

(5) May and Corbyn fail to come to an agreement before the EU elections, the UK government organizes the EU elections: \nBrexit is postponed once again \nThe UK remains in the EU \nThe UK Parliament approves the agreement: the UK leaves the EU with an agreement before October 31st 2019 \nThe UK Parliament disapproves the agreement: unknown outcome Forecast: \nThe UK Parliament rejected the idea of leaving the EU without a deal. Discontented with Brexit, the opposition will not let the worse case scenario unfold, adding to the determination of the UK Parliament not to turn into an accidental \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit. Hence, I see scenarios (2) and (4) as less likely to happen. In that sense, I do not expect May to be facing a \"no-deal\" and thereby, forced to leave office in such circumstances (in June 2019). I expect May to remain Prime Minister passed July 1st 2019 because I expect future events to tip towards May\u2019s deal. But, I think the UK Parliament will take advantage of the fact that Brexit has been postponed to October 31st. In that sense, I see scenarios (3) C.b & (5) C as to be most likely, with (3) C. a. & (5) D remaining in the panel of fair possibilities. Hence, I find more probability in the UK Parliament and May to converge towards a \u201cpositive\u201d outcome, but requiring May to cling onto her patience. In any case, I believe that May will not give up until Europe has run out of opportunities.  Nevertheless, Brexit remains a topic of high uncertainty. Therefore I assign a probability of 20% for a new Prime Minister to take on the UK before the 1st July 2019. With a Conservative majority in Parliament, the successor would be found in this party.

However, a very possible very poor showing in the European elections could make the the negative noise around her so great that it will be seen by Theresa May as the reason to step down and for her foes to go in for the kill (against some of their own desires to wait) and she could step down swiftly for the sake of Brexit and her party. However, she is likely to resist this in the belief that a transition to a new leader without any form of a deal would be too much of a self inflicted wound at such a vulnerable and critical moment. She will weigh what will be the greatest cause of weakness, the noise around her or a transition to a new leader and ultimately her decision will be based on this. It could be quite likely that a strong Labour showing (possibly double the vote of the Conservatives based on initial polling) will make her position untenable and she will leave. She would be blamed for this good showing by her actions in legitimising Labour and their Brexit ideas by reaching out to them for a deal. It is unlikely that any general election poll will be called prior or after the European elections given the weak state of the parties and a transition to a new leader is the most likely outcome and therefore it is unlikely that Corbyn can get in.

I think it is unlikely that either of these will happen sufficiently soon for her to be replaced by 1 July (partly because I think it would make more sense for either an election or a leadership contest to take place during the summer recess, which begins on 24 July).  Therefore, I think by far the most likely outcome is that she will be in power on 1 July (though if there is either an election or a leadership contest I think she would, in practice, more or less have to stand down).  If she is replaced, it is far more likely to be because she stood down as party leader than because she triggered an election, and in that case there would automatically be a Conservative replacement.  And even if an election is called, it is not at all clear that Labour would claim a majority, so for those two reasons the probability of a Conservative replacement must be significantly higher than the probability of a Labour replacement.

This is the clear demonstration that her main goal since her nomination has been getting out of EU in the more convenient and less disorganised way. So, I don\u2019t think she will resign till she would have reach the Brexit. Five days ago May has proposed an extension of the art. 50 till the 30th of June, and the EU needs to choose if approving it or not (today/tomorrow). An approval will mean no pressure about taking a decision before 12th April or 22nd of May, but also confirm the participation of the UK to the European elections.\nMoreover \u201cPrime Minister Theresa May has won a vote of confidence in her leadership of the Conservative Party in December 2018 after securing 63% of the total vote: she is now immune from a leadership challenge for a year\u201d. In the next month she will remain in charge trying to unblock the situation (60% probability), proposing for the fourth time the agreement to the UK parliament or restart the negotiations with UE. However, the deadlock in the Parliament can open other possibilities. The MP have demonstrated to be unable to reach an agreement on no-one of the 8 possible solutions proposed in the end of March, showing the division inter and intra parties. Because May can\u2019t gather all the votes of her party (divided in who wants an hard and who a soft brexit) other scenarios are likely to occur. In the last days, because of the deep disagreement in her party, May has started negotiations with Jeremy Corbin, the leader of the Labour Party (at the opposition) in order to obtain a softer Brexit. In front of such a deadlock another possibility would be going for snap elections. However, the chaotic situation is dropping the approval rating for May but also for the entire conservative party, seen more and more as unable to manage the Brexit and to satisfy the citizens expectation and in this case Labour could maybe win. I think that this new election scenario is very unlikely to occor because Conservative parties are aware of the possibility of losing at this turn and would do their best to avoid them. That\u2019s why I asset the possibility of a Labour prime minister at 10% and of another party one at 0% Indeed, I believe that no new forces could arise so quickly and gain enough population support. Plus, the Brexit issue is fragmented enough, such as the two main parties: I think the Britain people doesn\u2019t want to add a new front in the debate.\nInstead, I see more likely the possibility of a new referendum, so much requested by the Labourists, even if May doesn\u2019t like this option because, again, her aim is respecting the Britain will and deliver on the 2016 referendum outcome.\n"], [68885, "2019-04-11T00:27:31Z", [0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5], ""], [68880, "2019-04-11T00:25:05Z", [0.5, 0.2, 0.02, 0.28], ""], [68875, "2019-04-11T00:24:26Z", [0.65, 0.25, 0.05, 0.05], "Bizarrely, even after all the cuts and blunders, Conservative is still polling higher than any other party.

And would admit that accepting an extension that could last after 30 June was concrete evidence of her failure. \nI see little prospect of Mrs May making any progress on Brexit, but I now doubt that she will admit it and resign. \nForcing a General Election would not be good for either Conservatives or Labour,and if they both don't want to risk an election I don't see how parliament could force it. The Conservative Party can't vote out Mrs May as leader. In these strange times I suppose the whole Cabinet could resign so she has no ministers, and that might force her to resign as PM. \nI suppose that legally an argument could be put forward that if the WA is not passed by parliament before the end of next week then the UK could not leave the EU before 30th June. My reasoning is that for the UK to leave the EU the EU Parliament has to agree the WA, which (I believe) can only take place after the UK Parliament has approved it. As the EU parliament will not be in session after next week until July my assumption is that legally the UK cannot leave the EU until at least July because the EU Parliament (presumably) cannot agree the WA if it is not in session. So if Mrs May has said she would not accept extending A50 after 30th June, then what ever happened to her WA after next week would mean crossing her red line. So it is just possible that Mrs May would resign next week, but I would guess she would find some excuse for not resigning.  \nI intend revising my forecast next week.

It appears her sole objective is to deliver on the referendum vote of 2016. This was made clear last week when she offered to resign in exchange for an approval of her withdrawal agreement. It appears then, that once she has produced a deliverable on Brexit, May will be inclined to resign \u2014 having fulfilled her objective as Prime Minister. Thus, whether May will still be Prime Minister on July 1 will likely depend on whether a Brexit agreement is finally made in the coming months. We know that having won a vote of no confidence in December, she is immune to another until the end of this year. Thus the scenarios in which May ceases to be PM in July are two fold: 1) she resigns, and 2) a snap election is called and the opposition wins.  1. Resignation\nIf a Brexit deal is delivered, as mentioned, this seems probable. It is also seems possible if, unable to deliver a deal, she accepts defeat. We have witnessed extraordinary actions by MPs crossing the floor and voting against their own party/ government \u2014 illustrating the party\u2019s fragility and May\u2019s weakening authority. In the last few days, she has also been been negotiating strategy with opposition leader, Jeremy Corbyn, which may fuel more anger and chaos within her own party. A failure to deliver a solution may result in her disenfranchisement, pushing May to step aside for another in her party to instigate new efforts at producing something tangible. May has endured many turbulences however, and seems determined to deliver. If a deal is not made, and a longer extension is granted, this may compel her to hold onto leadership to see a solution through to the end. At this stage though, she has voiced intention to apply for a short extension \u2014 seemingly optimistic that a solution can be agreed upon in the short-term. 2. Snap election\nAn early election may be a means for overcoming the deadlock the government faces. It appears that satisfying the majority of members is a near impossible task \u2014 based on May\u2019s failure to do so despite the high stakes. This seems an unlikely move, however. Given that the drama surrounding Brexit has divided the nation, the government risks losing leadership at this point in time. It seems more likely they will call a referendum to make progress on Brexit solutions before they call a general election, as this puts the government and May in a real (and probably) position to be defeated. Thus, the forecast that the Prime Minister of the UK will be a member of the Labour Party on July 1, is low (5%). The chance a member from a party other than labour or the conservatives is considered so improbable it has been exclude from consideration \u2014 no other party wields enough political or voting power to take leadership, even if a snap election were to take place.  In sum:\nThis determines the least likely leadership scenarios on July 1 to be PM from Labour (5%) or a member from a party other than the Conservatives or Labour (0%). It will largely come down to May\u2019s decision to step aside for the good of her party in the face of a longer extension, or her resignation in response to successfully delivering on the goal of her term (Brexit). Given her endurance thus far, it seems most likely that another member will assume leadership only in the instance that a deal is delivered and she steps down; only a major upheaval within the party would have her resign without delivering a deal. This may be ignited with her negotiations with the opposition, however. Ultimately, this forecast thus comes down to whether or not a tangible plan on Brexit is solidified in the coming months. With pressure mounting from both within the EU and UK, and considering May\u2019s optimism, it is foreseeable that something will be produced in the short term. However, it must be considered that May, with or without a solution, could want to see out her term (or at try to unify her party before another vote of no confidence can possible remove her).  It is difficult to determine who will hold leadership position by July, but May seems slightly more likely than another member of her party at this stage as a decision of Brexit will may take some time. Even if, as May hopes, a short extension is enough to find an agreement, this will take some months \u2014 a swift resignation thereafter will cut close to July. Thus, at this stage, a 55% prediction that May will remain in office until at least July 1 is given, while 40% is given to the prospect of another member from her own party.

First and foreleast, the probability of a party other than the two primaries taking the post is effectively impossible. More intriguing is the fight between labour & conservative parties, and it's worth noting that the only scenario, or at least the only one I'm aware of, in which rule would change hands would be in the event of a snap general election changing the simple-majority to the labour party, thus the odds of any non-conservative being appointed in the event of May's resignation is effectively impossible. On the note of that resignation scenario though, I would say at this points it's far more likely a scenario than normal for this (i.e. May throwing around her resignation as a sweetener to her Brexit deal like a BOGO deal at TJ Max...). Thus borrowing a little from @Scott_R's analysis I have the following...\n - Baseline Rate of PM Resignition (Since 1940) = 18.8%\n - Assuming a volatility of 300%, current likelihood = 72.9% (did a sketchy bit of calculating here but it puts it near betting odds, so we'll see (note 1 below))\n - Likelihood of death, 1.3% scaled for time remaining until deadline = about 0.4%\n - Total = 73.3% And for the probability of a snap general election, given the split house this would require at least 98 of 317 seats held by the majority to vote for it.

In total, 8 of the 13 Prime Ministers (62%) that governed the UK after 1945 had to leave office before the regular end of their respective terms. Only one resignation was the product of a no-confidence vote and a party switch in the government after a corresponding general election. In the other 7 cases the prime ministers that took over office from the resigning precursors were members of the same party. While three of the PM resignations were connected to individual issues, such as health or scandals, the vast majority, namely 5 were related to major political decisions, 1 domestic and 4 international. Particular, interesting is that the international-related resignations were related to issues concerning either the Middle-East or Europe. Turning to the Europe-related cases it is furthermore very interesting that both resignations Thatcher and Cameron were members of the conservative party. While in the case of Thatcher arguably other issues lead to her defeat, too, one great difficulty during her time in office was the issue of Europe. Her long-serving Foreign Secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe resigned in November 1990 in protest at her attitude to Europe. His resignation speech brought about events which were to lead to her exit from 10 Downing Street later that month. Michael Heseltine challenged her for the leadership, and while he failed to win, he gained 152 votes \u2013 enough to make it evident that a crucial minority favoured a change. Thatcher was eventually persuaded not to go forward to the second ballot, which was won by her Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major. John Major himself struggled with his party over Europe afterwards, too. He secured a number of opt-outs from the Maastricht Treaty regarding social policy and membership of the single currency \u2013 but this was not enough for a number of his colleagues. Throughout the rest of his time as Prime Minister, he suffered from continued attacks from his own party and Cabinet on Europe, which played a role in destabilising the government - however, he remained in office. Finally, in 2016 PM Cameron resigned after the Brexit referendum, when he campaigned to stay within the EU, but the majority of the British voted to leave. This very referendum is also crucial for the destiny of current conservative PM May and thus for the question at hand.  In sum, 62% of PM after World War II had to leave office early. Only once a no-confidence vote was successful with new general elections and ultimately a prime minister from a different party. Turning to the Tories it must be considered that all 3 conservative precursors of May were struggling over Europe - with only Major who could end his term - though the struggle over Europe was crucial in the lost general elections. Based upon that and further increased through the dramatic tensions in the UK related to Brexit, as well as May\u2019s announcement to be will to step back under certain conditions, the forecast at hand estimates a 65% likelihood of Theresa May to be replaced by a conservative party member. A 10% likelihood is estimated for Labor PM to replace her, due to the fact that one of the 10 (non-individual-related) resignations was a product of a non-confidence vote. Correspondingly, the forecast at hand estimates the likelihood of May staying Prime Minister after July 1, as of 20% and due to the high degree of uncertainty related to Brexit a 5% probability of a replacement that is neither member of Labour, nor the Conservatives.  *The information for the Base-rates were gathered from the official Prime Minister profiles as of presented by the British Government: https://www.gov.uk/government/history/past-prime-ministers\n"], [172, "2019-03-30T02:31:34Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [41922, "2019-03-30T00:24:06Z", [0.4, 0.3, 0.0, 0.3], ""], [14493, "2019-03-29T15:59:51Z", [0.95, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05], "@dsarin I agree with Matthias Struwe The UK needs to ask for help and understanding!"], [14493, "2019-03-29T15:48:45Z", [0.95, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05], "Mrs May had promised to resign if she won today's Brexit Withdrawal vote.

Backbench MPs will continue to work towards a consensus on what type of Brexit parliaments will stomach. This all needs to be done in the next two weeks. My guess is that if Mrs May gets the EU to agree the long extension to A50 she will resign, by April as no new negotiation on a new deal with the EU will take place until the autumn and she has been told by her MPs that she is not the person to lead the negotiations. The gap between now and the autumn gives a chance for the Conservatives to change the PM and figure out a plan (lack of a plan has been a problem for the last 33 months). It is possible that Mrs May might delay her resignations until after the UK local elections on 2nd May or until after the EU elections on 23rd May, but in reality there is no good time for the Conservatives to change the PM without looking weak and lacking any ideas.

(https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/27/theresa-may-to-resign-before-next-phase-of-brexit). She has not announced a specific date for her withdrawal, however provided that she can finally secure a majority for her deal (which seems unlikely) and she stays true to her word, this has to happen until May 22, the date the EU has set as a new deadline for the UK leaving the EU.  Today on May 29, parliament is set to vote for a third time on May's deal. Despite her attempt to secure the support of hardline-Brexiteers by tying the vote with a promise to step down, everything points to another defeat. While some Brexiteers, most notably Boris Johnson have said, they are prepared to vote in favor, May still lacks support of most of the opposition as well as 10 MP's of the Northern Irish DUP, who remain adamant in their opposition to the deal and about 20 conservative party members opposed to leaving the EU in the first place. If the deal miraculously gets through, the UK has time until May 22 to leave the EU. May will likely step down from office until or shortly after that date. If not, the UK must either leave or convince the EU to grant a further extension until April 12. May has not indicated whether she would remain in office in this case but both scenarios render that possibility unlikely: If the UK fails to come up with a new plan and is forced to leave without a deal, May would take all the blame and almost certainly be forced to step down. If another extension is granted in between now and April 12, she could carry on longer but would incur the ire of the Brexiteers who would feel betrayed and troubled by the chance of a second referendum.  Anticipating a defeat, May might already be prepared to push for a fourth vote in the time remaining until April 12. (https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/theresa-may-offers-stand-down-as-british-prime-minister-11388870). Chances are that some MP's from both the conservative party and the opposition, horrified by the prospect of a no deal would finally throw their support behind her. Regardless of the outcome of the third (and potentially fourth) vote, it is likely that May's days in Downing Street No. 10 are numbered. Cabinet members have already discussed installing a caretaker (https://www.ft.com/content/878b966e-4dbe-11e9-b401-8d9ef1626294). This remains a possibility, especially in the event of a crushing defeat. However, it also presupposes that she resigns on her own terms, as Tory party rules dictate that another leadership challenge cannot be brought against her until December (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-22/u-k-cabinet-ministers-are-wargaming-the-fall-of-theresa-may). Thus, even amidst seemingly growing pressure, from the in- and outside, there is a slight chance that May, will hold on to power for a while, especially if she is pushing for another vote or hoping to work out a another extension with the EU (though that would likely mean that the UK would have to participate in the European Elections, a prospect dreaded by many conservatives). It has become more and more evident, that within the conservative party, there is already a fight going on for May's succession with Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, Jeremy Hunt, Sajid Javid, and Dominic Raab being among the most prominent contenders. If May resigns, it is likely that a conservative MP will take over. First, because the hurdles of holding general elections are quite high, effectively requiring a (government proposed) motion passed by a two thirds majority or a successful vote of no confidence against the government (https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6864151/What-happens-Theresa-wins-vote-really-election-loses.html). Second, since opinion polls have been static for a long time, with slight losses for both Labour and the Conservatives (who are still ahead). (https://www.theweek.co.uk/94729/who-will-be-the-next-prime-minister-betting-odds-and-polls). At the same time, the deadlock between the Tory-led government and the parliament is likely to take its toll on the conservative party and none of the aforementioned candidates can be sure to gather support from every faction in the internally divided party. Add to this the possible scenarios of a hard Brexit, a second referendum or a participation in the European elections, all of which are dreaded by party members and part of the population alike. If things go awry, this might well play into the cards of Labour.  In summary: 80% Someone from the Conservative Party: Very likely given the fact that candidates are already positioning themselves, the obstacles for holding general elections and the polls showing the Tories ahead of every other party.  15% Someone from the Labour Party: Unlikely since Labour just like the conservatives is internally divided and their leader Jeremy Corbyn lacks the support of a large part of the population (https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/15/jeremy-corbyn-slides-in-approval-ratings-in-spite-of-tory-schisms). However, much depends on how the Brexit plays out and who is assigned the blame. 0% Someone from neither Labour or the Conservatives: No chance. None of the other parties is strong enough to challenge the conservatives. There is no sign of a candidate from another party enjoying bipartisan support and likewise no political movement like Emmanuel Macron's La R\u00e9publique En Marche, that isn't associated with one of the parties. 5% May will remain in power: Unlikely but not completely impossible if she loses the vote (and possible consecutive votes) on her withdrawal deal but manages to secure a further extension of the deadline from the EU."], [56294, "2019-03-29T13:57:10Z", [0.64, 0.07, 0.01, 0.28], ""], [66556, "2019-03-29T11:35:31Z", [0.4, 0.6, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [29652, "2019-03-29T09:54:11Z", [0.75, 0.15, 0.05, 0.05], "May is going to resign"], [68, "2019-03-29T05:52:09Z", [0.65, 0.0, 0.0, 0.35], ""], [67312, "2019-03-29T02:18:28Z", [0.47, 0.01, 0.03, 0.49], ""], [67799, "2019-03-29T01:39:46Z", [0.46, 0.0, 0.0, 0.54], ""], [172, "2019-03-29T00:17:21Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [55911, "2019-03-28T23:31:02Z", [0.95, 0.04, 0.01, 0.0], ""], [31461, "2019-03-28T23:06:59Z", [0.65, 0.05, 0.01, 0.29], ""], [61367, "2019-03-28T21:31:41Z", [0.4, 0.1, 0.0, 0.5], ""], [39937, "2019-03-28T21:01:41Z", [0.99, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01], ""], [1333, "2019-03-28T20:01:09Z", [0.9, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1], ""], [1333, "2019-03-28T19:49:11Z", [0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25], ""], [17875, "2019-03-28T16:45:37Z", [0.02, 0.01, 0.0, 0.97], "I'm reminded of the Benjamin Franklin's first, maybe best, original political cartoon.

Current Brexit Context: The EU has granted an extension until April 12 for Theresa May to get the agreement accepted. However, the agreement seems so uncertain to be successful that Theresa May does not consider it worthwhile to represent it a third time.\nIn addition, an outright revocation of the Brexit is called for by an online petition on the Parliament website signed by more than 5.5 million people in five days, a historic record. Position of May:\n- Prime Minister Theresa May has won a vote of confidence in her leadership of the Conservative party by 200 to 117. After securing 63% of the total vote, she is now immune to a leadership challenge for a year (https: // www. bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46547246).\nThis means that the internal trust (conservatives) is acquired for 1 year, and therefore the arrival of a new prime minister by this way is not possible for July 1, 2019. Nevertheless, she lost 1/3 of its supports.\n-On January 16, 2019, Theresa May won a no-confidence vote by 325 to 306. The PM won the vote by a margin of 19, including 10 votes from the DUP. If the party voted against her, she would have lost by one (https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46899466). The Tory MPs, however, unanimously supported her in the vote (the 314 voted for it). External trust is therefore extremely weak, and hard brexiters of the DUP can change everything. If the Brexit is not done in their own way (Hard Brexit) or is not done at all, they will not give their support (as they did by rejecting the Brexit agreements of May).\n-Theresay May serves as PM for one purpose: deliver the Brexit and leave the European Union. If Brexit becomes impossible, she will resign for sure.\n-She said she will step down as leader before the next elections in 2022. Base rate of no-confidence votes in the XX and XXI centuries(Source: House of Commons Library)\n- Conservative governments have seen off 20 confidence votes\n- Labor has won 12 - and only one was lost (in 1979, Callaghan was defeated)\nThe Base rate tends to show that the vote of no confidence may not be the most likely way to have a new prime minister. Possibility of next Prime Minister (there is no possibility for an another party):\nCorbyn (Labor)\nLidington (Tory)\nGove (Tory) Forecast:\nTheresa May will not leave because of an internal confidence vote. A vote of no-confidence (external) could push her out, but according to the base rates, it seems less likely, and especially knowing that she has won one (even if it was very short). Resignation would be the most likely way. Anyway, the pressure tightening on her, and no matter what happens, May will be strongly criticized by two camps out of three (Pro-EU, Hard Brexiters, Soft Brexiters).\n-Indeed, April 12 is a crucial date, because if Theresa May's Brexit agreement is not accepted by then, there will be the vote to hold European elections (in order to have an another extension for May), or the no-deal.\n-In case of no-deal, Labor and the Soft-Brexiters will be extremely irate, as well as the population and the economic circles, and the pressure will be so strong that the uncertainty will reign in the country, which could push May to give up .\n-In case of a decision to make European elections, the Soft and Hard Brexiters will feel aggrieved, and May could end up either vulnerable to a vote of no-confidence, or she could resign, seeing the possibility of Brexit (her only mission) gone, especially if the demand for a second referendum is very strong in the new deadline until May.\n-If the agreement is accepted, the Labor but especially important the DUP (and some Tory Hard Brexiters) will not be satisfied, and Theresa May will be extremely vulnerable to a vote of no-confidence.\nMay's room for maneuver is extremely weak, and she is forced in any case to frustrate two camps to have only the support of one, which leads to a precarious situation for her. Similarly, May met on March 25 with some Brexiters, who would have tried to negotiate their support for the deal in exchange for an early resignation of the Prime Minister.\nThe next few weeks seem to show a likely coup de grace in one way or another for a PM in crisis of authority. However, nothing is done, and we should not be so pessimistic for her, she has been very combative and resilient since the Brexit referendum (indeed, the threats of putsch of her ministers against her were disarmed very quickly), and she could always succeed a tour de force to stay in power by July 2019 and put forward the Brexit, its ultimate (and only) political goal."], [42680, "2019-03-25T20:28:54Z", [0.1, 0.3, 0.0, 0.6], "The shift is becoming more likely given the tenuous outcome of the pending Brexit deal (or lack thereof)"], [1333, "2019-03-25T20:23:05Z", [0.48, 0.0, 0.0, 0.52], ""], [39937, "2019-03-25T19:53:51Z", [0.89, 0.0, 0.0, 0.11], ""], [67415, "2019-03-25T19:40:01Z", [0.65, 0.1, 0.0, 0.25], ""], [63730, "2019-03-25T13:58:09Z", [0.69, 0.2, 0.01, 0.1], ""], [41922, "2019-03-25T13:46:37Z", [0.5, 0.1, 0.0, 0.4], ""], [1150, "2019-03-25T13:45:33Z", [0.4, 0.05, 0.05, 0.5], "Significantly increasing pressure on May to step down to get the assent of other ministers to back a Brexit deal.

A lot of this comes down to at what point a group could be brought together to bring the government down it would be a gamble for at least some of the people who would have to lose confidence. I have to introduce a chaos factor to draw the chance of eventualities closer together (30%).  Given a 7/16 Government falling by 25th May (it took 37 days in 1979 from lost vote to new PM) to 9/16 chance of government surviving. In the election the Conservatives would likely still be the largest party 5/6 (likely in a minority government needing a coalition) almost any situation is going to allow the partner to request May resign so if they don't get a majority May would have a 1/5 chance of survival boosted however by the possibility of delay so 2/5 [the leadership contest could be done in preparation for the election if a clear candidate emerged or a caretaker was appointed NOTE you do not have to be party leader to be prime minister].  So: 70% x 7/16 x 5/6 x 1/2 12% for May after the election 12 % another Conservative 5% Labour from the Government falls scenario. If Government survives it is hard to see who would want he job but the desire for power or the country/ party might be desperate I'll say 13/20. So: 70% x 9/16 x 13/20 so extra 26% for Different Conservative and 14 % for May. I'll split the chaos factor 9,9,9,3% 14+12+9=35% For May. 26+12+9=47% for another Conservative. 5+9=14%.

Of the 5% left remaining a 2% goes to the option \"Yes, someone from the Labour Party,\" and a 3% to the option \"Yes, someone from the Conservative Party\".  That is because, as I said in the previous forecast,  since T. May is likely to resign once the Brexit process will be over,  whether she is still PM by  July 1 or not will now much depend on the extent of this delay which is not completely settled. Indeed, the British Parlament accepted to delay Brexit, however, the EU has agreed to extend the Brexit deadline until 22 May only if the UK proposes a new plan before April 12. If that happens, then I still asses a high possibility to have the same PM in July since T. May won't resign until the transaction to go out of the EU will be completely over (as she declared), a process which requires time (at least all June and July).  On the other hand, today May has told MPs that there might not be a third vote on her Brexit deal next week if there is insufficient support for it to pass. This, of course, creates a deal of uncertainty because has highlighted by the EU if there is not a clear and alternative plan the UK is set to leave the EU on April 12.  In this case, the possibility of May resigning would be higher. However, I am still confident a solution will be found since it is in the interest of both sides and therefore Theresa May will stay in charge \"to get the job done\". \n"], [1333, "2019-03-23T18:38:59Z", [0.45, 0.0, 0.0, 0.55], ""], [54817, "2019-03-23T18:07:32Z", [0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.9], ""], [67448, "2019-03-23T18:00:59Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "No, because no one wants to be prime minister at the moment.

The second stage of Brexit, the New Trading relationship will in theory start by 23 rd May, but in practice due to the EU Parliament elections and electing a new EU Commission they will not really start until the autumn.  2. May's WA does not get through parliament.\n2.1 The UK then has until 12th April to decide if it wants to take part in the EU parliamentary elections.\n2.1.1 If the UK takes part in the UK parliamentary elections it can extend A50 in order to discuss options with the EU other than May's WA. These options could include a referendum, and/or a general election, and/or a different WA/Political Statement.\n2.1.2 If the UK does not agree to taking part in the EU parliamentary elections it will leave the EU with no deal on \n12th April. So how does that affect Mrs May? If the UK leaves the EU on 12th April it seems very likely she will resign. She would be able to claim that she had delivered Brexit, but I doubt if many people would thank her. So I think she would resign asap after 12th April before people start to notice too much damage.  If the UK takes part in EU parliamentary elections Mrs May will resign as she has said she rejects the ideas of fighting a general election, is against a referendum, and is against any alternative Brexit outcome to her WA. If she did not offer to resign she would be forced out as it has become very obvious she is not suited to getting a Brexit deal. If May's WA is passed by parliament she will resign sometime after completing the legislation on 22nd May and the start of negotiating the New Trade Arrangements. She could claim Brexit victory as long as she does not start the NTA negotiations which are likely to be long and difficult and its generally considered she would not be good at it. An earlier resignation would be better as it would give a new PM more opportunity to plan what to do.     If May resigns or is forced out it (almost) certain that she would be replaced by another Conservative, as they have the most seats in parliament.  So the only one of these options that are likely to see Mrs May remain as PM after 22nd May is if her WA gets through parliament, and even then there will be pressure on her to resign asap, but she might hold on until July. If you trust Mr Macron as a Forecaster Mrs May has only a 5% chance of the UK parliament voter her WA through. I think the chances are a little better, maybe 20%? And if she does get her WA through there is maybe a 30% chance of her holding on until July.

It is just as an aspirational wish list of contradictory statement that could never be delivered as a Free Trade Deal with the EU. It would be far harder to get any agreement than the WA has been.

This is the most time accurate, geographical and situational baseline that can be find on this forecast. Nevertheless, in the next days a unique event will see its final phases, namely Brexit. The day in which it will happen - as analyzed in the forecast about the Article 50's extension - depends basically from Theresa May's ability to draft a program for Brexit which finds the Parliament's agreement. Her success or failure in driving her country into a successful or failing Brexit will determine much of her resilience as Prime Minister. If the Brexit process will be moved after the 1 July, it's unlikely that she will have to face another non-confidence vote, as at least her party can't constitutionally invoke another no-confidence vote until next December (I would give this outcome a 60% probability, in line with the already mentioned forecast).

This is particularly true in regard to the Brexit talks outcome, which is very tied to May\u2019s future and in turn hard to be forecasted. Therefore, let\u2019s start with some general considerations for then narrowing the focus to the given situation.  Firstly, excluding the case where Theresa May dies (hopefully for her), there are three different ways in which the PM might change. These are a) Resignation b) Vote of No Confidence 3) New General Election \nThe latter, agreement for a new election, would require two-thirds of parliament (i.e. also the conservative majority shall vote in that sense). This outcome is particularly unlikely, especially before July 1. However, it cannot be completely excluded since calling for a new election, in case of a Brexit disaster, might become a strategic move for the Conservatives to launch a new leadership and obtain a strong mandate in order to deal with the aftermaths of Brexit.  The vote of no confidence wouldn\u2019t be that unlikely if such vote hadn\u2019t already taken place on 12 Dec 2018. Not only in this occasion May survived to the vote, moreover, according to party rules, another vote may only be held after 1 year. Of course, it could be called by the Labour party, however, since they are the minority they would need the consensus of a large section of conservatives which make it extremely unlikely.  Consequently, if the British PM is going to change before July 1 the first option, Resignation, is the one I see as the more likely. It is true that, as data shows, such outcome happened only 3 times since 1940 (out of 16 total PMs in the whole period), making the average of PM stay in charge at 4.9 years. However, the current British political environment, especially due to the Brexit situation, has some peculiarities that cannot be compared with any previous historical pattern. Furthermore, Theresa May has suggested in more the one occasion that she\u2019s not intend to reach the end of the terms (which is in 2022) but that she is willing to stay in charge until the end of Brexit in order to guarantee to the British population the possible outcome possible. Therefore, I see the chances of May resigning closely tied to the result of Brexit. In this regard, as I have already explained in a different forecast, I see as the most likely outcome that Article 50 (and thus Brexit) will be extended by the UK and the European Council before March. However, in this regard, much will depend on the upcoming vote  of March 12. In fact, The House of Commons (the British Parliament) will vote on March 12 the agreement signed by May with Brussels. In case of rejection (very likely), they will hold another vote the day after choosing between a no- deal or a deal Brexit (allowing in case an extension of article 50). Since the terrific consequences of a no deal, I see this outcome by far as the most likely, with May obtaining a new (although still weak) mandate to find an agreement with the EU after March. In doing so, May will try to snatch some concession to return to Westminster with a text more \"digestible\" for his deputies. This process is likely to end after the summer and for this reason I assess a 70% of chance that there won\u2019t be a new PM before July 1.  Concluding, what remains to be said is assigning the probabilities in case May resigned before July. In this case, I see the possibility of a new Labour PM much more unlikely than of a new Conservative one. Indeed, although according to IPSO\u2019s trends now both the two parties have the 38% of electoral consensus, if May resigned the most likely scenario is the internal election of a new PM among the Conservative Party. The third option, someone of a third party, although never happened after 1945, cannot be completely excluded in the given situation. In fact, in case of a no deal and therefore disastrous consequences for the British Economy, it is not completely excludable the creation of a government of national unity. However, if this outcome is quite unlikely in the long run, it is even more unlikely to happen before July 1.

To have a general election Conservative MPs would need to vote for it. That is very unlikely while Mrs May is the PM because her MPs will remember how she turned a good lead in the polls, before she called the 2017 general election,  into losing the Conservative majority by the time the election took place. While Corbyn is Labour leader is seems very unlikely that Labour would win an election. So any election that took place would probably result in Conservatives and Labour both losing votes and the result being very unpredictable (e.g. low turn out? More votes going to other parties, who may or may not actually win many more seats, a hung parliament?). What would happen in Scotland for example? Scotland voted to Remain, but neither May nor Corbyn has done anything to accommodate Scottish wishes to Remain or at least stay close to the EU, and to keep the EU Freedom of Movement. The SNP is a Remain party in a Remain country, so could pick up some more seats. \n\nIt is possible that Mrs May could resign if she manages to get an EU Withdrawal Deal agree by parliament. Probably that will not happen before 29th March, and if it did A50 would almost certainly need to be extended past 29th March . But as soon as the UK leaves the EU (if it in fact does) Mrs May could resign and the Conservatives would electe a new leader, who would automatically become PM.  My guess is the odds are about 35% that the EU Withdrawal Deal will be passed before 1st July.  Getting the EU Withdrawal Deal is the easy part of Brexit, the hard part will start after parliament approves it and the serious arguments on what type of Future Relationship parliament can agree to. It would need to work for the Irish border or NI will become a problem, and it will need to work for UK manufacturing and food business or the manufacturers will start moving to the EU and the farmers will start going broke (as forecast by the Brexiteers favorite economist Patrick Minford) and the hard line Brexiteers.  Meanwhile  with or without the EU Withdrawal Agreement being passed  by parliament the world economy looks to be turning down, and if it does the UK looks likely to suffer more than most countries because until there is a Future Trade Agreement agreed businesses are unlikely to invest due to uncertainty. Business tends not to stand still, it either invests and moves forward, or it does not and declines (or moves location in the case of Brexit). So it will be interesting to see what happens to the Brexit sentiment if the economy goes into decline. The Leave voters say they are clear that they don't mind being worse off after Brexit, but I am not sure that they have the imagination to picture themselves poorer (or relatively poorer) than the countries that remained in the EU.)

Take this as the outside view. Inside view: She has survived so much -- lost a general, lost critical Brexit vote, faced down a no confidence. She appears to be unyielding. Options are death or resignation. Death we can handle with ONS stats [2] since she's 62 she has a very high chance of living >140-ish days (<5%). Resignation is trickier because Brexit is such unknown. Taking the 6 possible outcomes I can foreseee and giving them a 16.6% chance each, I think that only a no-deal Brexit leading to civil hardship would make her consider resignation. I take this at only 6% likelihood total, giving an inside view of 89% likelihood of surviving. Taking the midpoint between inside and outside view (because I'm lazy) gives 74% of survival. To the question of who will replace her: I don't think a party from another party could get a foothold fast enough in this scenario, so I give it the minimum of 1% (I would go lower if I could).

May's so-called plan B was approved by a majority of members of parliament, with some amendments. And it's these amendments which have put flesh on the bones of that plan.\nIn short, Parliament has told us that it favors sending May back to Brussels to seek concessions on the Northern Ireland backstop. That's the part of the Withdrawal Agreement which aims to prevent the return of border infrastructure between the Republic of Ireland, which will remain in the EU, and Northern Ireland, which will leave with the UK. This has been the single most contentious issue in the ranks of Theresa May's Conservative Party.\nIn theory, Parliament also ruled out a no-deal Brexit. But it failed to pass any amendment that would have achieved that aim, such as commanding the government to request an extension to the March 29 Brexit deadline, in the event it couldn't pass a deal by the end of February. After two years of this nonsense, it's nothing short of remarkable that the people elected to represent the citizens of the UK still think that this is in their gift (Para. 1-3).\nBut there's a snag.\nThe EU has been consistent in saying that the Withdrawal Agreement is done, locked down, not up for renegotiation. It appears not to matter how many times EU officials, diplomatic sources or even May herself tells her rebels this, they seem to think someone is lying. But without the Withdrawal Agreement being reopened, the backstop cannot be changed (Para. 4).\nAnd if the government eventually decides it wants an extension to the Brexit deadline, that must be agreed by the European Council -- the body which comprises the leaders of each member state. It would need to be approved unanimously, meaning any country can veto and, as I'm sure you can see, 28 is a big number.\nUnless the UK is willing to concede that May's deal is dead, the EU is unlikely to give the UK more time to continue howling at the moon. As one European diplomatic source recently told me, the EU is loathe to redraft something which has taken 28 nations two years to negotiate in the hope of tweaking it with weeks to go (Para. 4-6). The threat also works for those mortified at the prospect of crashing out without a deal. The Article 50 process -- the official EU exit route -- is nearly over. Without a revocation of Article 50 -- the request of which is in the UK's gift, but is also a total headache -- the default is that the UK leaves the EU on March 29, with or without a deal.

May's proposal of a confidence vote indicates a high degree of confidence that she will win such a vote. The numbers support this analysis. A no confidence vote requires 2/3 support in the House, or 434 of 650 votes. Labour holds 229. Assuming all non-Conservatives in the House of Commons (HoC) express no confidence, 114 of 330 Conservatives (34.5%) would also have to express no confidence in the PM for May to lose the confidence vote. \nIf May were to lose the confidence vote, there would be a 14-day window for the Conservatives to build a new governing coalition. Successfully building a new coalition in the present circumstances would be extremely difficult, and if the Conservatives fail to build a new coalition, a general election would follow. It is impossible to assess the prospects for the Conservatives in a general election, and I expect they prefer not to test the public, having performed poorly in the last general election that they themselves initiated.  Therefore, the best of the set of unattractive options for the Conservatives is to support May in the confidence vote tomorrow, so I assess the probability of May losing the confidence as low (10 - 15%). As a result, the only route I see for May to exit from the PM role by 1 July is via resignation, and her recent comments and positioning lead me to believe that this is marginally less likely today than at my last assessment.

I think if the deal passes, May would would stay. If the deal fails to pass, there are 3 days to come up with the so-called 'Plan B', but I don't think there is much ground to be gained with the EU in that timeframe. So I actually see 'Plan B' failing to pass the Commons at 90% probability, factoring in that there might not even be a vote. What could change that is May threatening the no deal scenario, but I would think that she would face a vote of no confidence soon after that attempt. With plan B rejected, think it is certain that a vote of no confidence that allows for general elections in time before the question closes will follow. Given a vote of no confidence in time, I see a 95% probability of May/the government loosing that vote (in this scenario neither the deal nor Plan B passed).

If there was a General Election today, and Labour ran with the leader it currently has (Corbyn) and with a manifesto that is the same as its current policy (which includes \"to deliver Brexit\") it difficult to see how it could get more seats in parliament than it has now. Corbyn is seen by those who did not vote Labour in the 2017 as a good example of a 1960s socialist who has had no new ideas in the last 50 years, and is incapable of responding to the world of today. If they had felt Corbyn had anything to offer then they would have voted Labour in 2017. On the other hand there is a growing number of people who voted Labour in 2017 hoping that Corbyn really believed in letting Labour Party Members set the parties policies. but It has become clear that Corbyn's belief in policies set by the people, is as sincerely held by him as it was by Chairman Mao,  Stalin, and Mrs May (i.e.  the \"people's\" best interests are better served by an all knowing leader, than by taking any notice of the \"people\") \nThe advantage the Conservatives should have if an election were called before July is that presumably they would not be lead by Mrs May, who shares many of the faults that Corbyn has (does not know how to listen and change her policies, or how to lead - by which I mean, the ability to understand an issue, work with experts to formulate a possible solution and then sell that solution to people who had different ideas, in order that the solution is implemented.) In an election of Corbyn vs May the ineptitude of both would cancel each other out and the result could go either way, although Corbyn would have the advantage that as he has never held any government post voters have not had concrete evidence of how bad he would be. May on the other hand has been PM and there is lots of evidence how bad she is. \nSo in an election without May the Conservatives could have picked a competent leader with some ideas, which would be a great advantage and could attract wide support and give them a win. But the chances are that the Conservatives could replace May by leader who is as bad as May, and if the Conservative Party Members get their say they would likely pick someone as leader who is a lot worse, and would appeal to no one except the (few) Conservative Party Member. As Conservative MPs are (slightly) more sensible that the Conservative Members they will do all they can to avoid letting the Members pick a new leader. The easiest way to do this is refuse to vote for a General Election.\nTherefore my conclusion is that unless May resigns she will remain as PM because the only way to get rid of her by July would be for Conservative MPs to join the opposition in voting her out. They will not want to vote her out in fear of a worse leader (the Leavers fear another Remainer, Remainers fear a Leaver). \nIf the Conservatives are forced to elect a new leader then its a 50/50 chance that leader will have very little appeal to the wider electorate.

Therefore she would need to present a new plan of action to parliament by 21st Jan. \nThere are several things that could happen; (a) May could present a new plan, but a vote of no confidence in the government is called (b) May could herself call for a vote of confidence (c) parliament could present its own (cross party) plan and order May to carry out parliaments wishes. \nA confidence vote seems very likely, but May could win it by agreeing to do what parliament wants. The is big risk for both Labour and Conservatives is that it is very unclear which party would win a general election and its very unclear what the new PM that would inevitably be the result would do. The Conservatives could end up with their Members electing a new PM that could not control the Conservative MPs any better than May. If the Government entered a general election with May remaining as their candidate for PM its difficult to see how the Conservative MPs who had just expressed they had no confidence in her could back her. If May was still PM presumably her manifesto would be \"vote Conservative so we can pass the May Deal\", but as only around 25% of the public want the May Deal this hardly looks like an election winner. The alternative if May was still PM would be on a manifesto of \"vote for the Plan B which I have been telling you for months is not possible\". That does not sound like a winner either.\nLabour has a similar problem with the additional problem that the polls show them less popular than the Conservatives, so presumably to have a chance of winning an election they would need to change their Brexit policy (to being clearly against Brexit in the eyes of Remainers, but somehow being pro-Brexit in the eyes of Leavers. That seems to leave a very narrow policy option of the Norway+/Common Market 2.0)  e.g. technical outside the EU, but with most of the advantages (and disadvantages) \nhttps://labourlist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Common-Market-2.0.pdf\nMy guess is that an election will not take place, that A50 will be extended so a revised Withdrawal Agreement can be drawn up, and that a new detailed Political Statement for a new deal (quite likely based on Common Market 2.0) can be drawn up, and then a public vote to chose between Common Market 2.0 or remaining in the EU. (Other option such as No Deal Brexit will not get through parliament, a Canada ++ FT deal will cannot provide the frictionless trade needed to keep the Irish border as it is.  \n "], [31450, "2019-01-09T18:14:13Z", [0.3, 0.4, 0.0, 0.3], "While I don't think Brexit is likely on 3/29, if it does happen then I think there is a 30% chance that May then steps down with her job complete.

The poll was a large sample of 25,000 and the fieldwork was conducted over Christmas in the aftermath of all the uncertainty following the delayed Commons vote on Brexit and the 1922 no confidence vote.  It remains to be seen whether this public support for the Conservatives (as opposed to the Withdrawal Deal) will hold.  The key dynamic is that the Tory party (while divided between MPs' and members' Brexit preference) while risking a parliamentary split, in electoral terms has a much more robust coalition than does Labour (whose MPs, members and voters have more fault lines both between each other and within themselves, regarding Brexit preferences).   With a coalition much more likely to fracure this is why I have downgraded the likelihood of a Labour PM - although not by much, as any general election (if there were to be one) would not solely be about Brexit (which was how the YouGov poll was framed) but about many other issues (e.g. public services) on which Labour has more electorally attractive offers. It seems highly likely that Britain is in for a major political crisis over the next few weeks, as the difficulties of passing the EU Withdrawal Agreement become apparent, along with the associated risk of a disorderly 'no deal' exit.  The major volatility which will follow from this means that I do not want to underprice the likelihood of either possibility of a no confidence vote & Labour government (18%) or a complete breakdown of the two-party system and some shock result of a third party PM (2% - still *very* slim but not impossible - if it were to happen I think it would take longer than until July, but it can't be dismissed it entirely as if there is no deal/2nd ref then the whole infrastructure of parliamentary representation and party configurations will undergo immense strain over the next few months.  As with the Corn Laws, Irish Home Rule and Imperial Preference, it is quite possible for parties wreck themselves on these epoch-defining issues... 'Decades may happen in weeks' as Lenin put it.) I have given a slight uptick to a new Tory PM (from 40% to 41%) as if Theresa May fails to pass a deal (resulting in either a 'no deal' exit or a 2nd referendum) then there will be immense internal pressure for her to stand aside.  Currently this still seems the most likely outcome, as *even if the deal passes* it is likely that she will still be expected to stand down in order that the next stage of the EU negotiations can be taken with a fresh approach and imagination to define Britain's future relationship (rather than the necessary exercise in damage-mitigation that has been the exit negotiations).  I am still very concerned about the political instability we are likely to see across January-March, and it is very possible that events could move much faster than they might usually in 'ordinary' political time. It is difficult to assess this possibility against the 'timing' consideration I identified in yesterday's prediction. My biggest boost though is to Theresa May remaining in power on 1 July (from 35% to 39%), partly because the public are broadly sympathetic to her position (if not her deal), as evidenced by last night's YouGov poll and extreme impatience of the public with the no-confidence vote in December.

I think there will be significant fall out from the deal / no deal either way however so Scott_R's scenarios are worth revisiting in this context:\n1) Resignation - Given the infrequency of resignations I think it is hard to consider this to be a reliable data set. May is unlikely to resign and cannot be forced in the current circumstances, there is not a potential reason that I can see as convincing her to resign - I'd be interested to hear if other people have ideas, I suppose she may resign in the event of no deal but I am not sure she would. She would keep an eye on who might replace her leading to:\n2) Vote of No Confidence. I think this is the most likely option. However, it runs into the problem of timescale, there is unlikely to be enough pressure to cause this until very close to March - at which point the timescale is key. It takes about a month to organise a general election so there are two months in which I think a confidence vote is a practical possibility. This is a short timescale given the current dynamics in parliament and it is not quite clear whose interest having a vote of no confidence is in unless it is emergency back covering. Any washout period will also be unusually fraught given that the clock is ticking on Article 50 / its consequences after March. It would require substantial dynamism from the Labour front bench which I think is lacking. I think it is more likely to happen than be won.\n3) Agreement for a new general election - another way of putting it is this requires half of Conservative MP's - it's not in their interest - option two is more likely as it only require 34.5% I'd give the outcome of a general election 50:50 but I think it is unusually unlikely.\n"], [64045, "2019-01-06T05:24:04Z", [0.33, 0.67, 0.0, 0.0], "Brexit is becoming more controversial, and Labour is a bit more in opposition to it."], [53217, "2019-01-06T00:45:57Z", [0.05, 0.03, 0.02, 0.9], ""], [53217, "2019-01-05T23:51:27Z", [0.05, 0.03, 0.02, 0.9], ""], [691, "2019-01-05T21:20:05Z", [0.33, 0.1, 0.0, 0.57], ""], [64041, "2019-01-05T19:02:10Z", [0.4, 0.22, 0.03, 0.35], "I have amended this forecast slightly from my original submission a few mins ago, as it was my first one and I wasn't familiar with the format so accidentally submitted early. Rationale: Calling a general election is challenging under the Fixed Terms Parliament Act, which means that a Labour PM by July is not so likely (although I have allowed a certain amount of room for a vote of no-confidence in the event of a no-deal Brexit in March/April, so have given 22%)  For the same reason, the chance for a non-Labour/non-Tory leader is remote given the resurgence in the two parties' votes at the last election.  However, given recent volatility (with the looming probability of serious political turbulence when the Withdrawal Agreement stalls during Jan/Feb) I have given it a rating of 3%: not impossible, but pretty slim. Theresa May's credibility is largely shot among her own party despite having won her no confidence vote in December (which theoretically buys her another 12 months before an internal party challenge).   I strongly suspect that following the delivery (or not) of the EU withdrawal agreement, she will be expected to walk.   Given her humble \"I will stay as long as you want me\" promise to her backbenchers at the 1922 Committee after the botched 2017 election, I would be surprised if she clung on using the technicality of December's 12-month amnesty as a defence, if her party were to have had enough of her - she can be incredibly obstinate, but that trait is tempered by a deep sense of dutiful service which limits her susceptibility to stubborn power-hunger.  If the parliamentary party no longer wanted her, her character strongly suggests that she would go, allowing for a Tory colleague to take the reigns.  I have given this outcome 40% as the most likely. However MPs can be fickle and a material change in conditions favouring her could change her prospects - albeit currently it is hard to imagine quite how these might happen. Also to be considered is the timing, a Tory leadership contest can be quite a drawn-out affair (Conservative MPs arranging themselves into factions, then gradually narrowing down the contenders field to two acceptable candidates and finally asking every party member to vote on them).  Even if the PM agreed to step down sometime in spring/summer (May for instance), it is quite conceivable that she would still be in post by July 1st, even with a leadership contest ongoing.  I've therefore rated the status quo as a generous 35%, although this will need some adjustments as conditions change."], [64041, "2019-01-05T18:31:28Z", [0.57, 0.22, 0.01, 0.2], "Comment deleted on Jan 05, 2019 06:34PM UTC"], [64039, "2019-01-05T18:00:43Z", [0.35, 0.0, 0.0, 0.65], ""], [61514, "2019-01-05T17:51:16Z", [0.3, 0.0, 0.0, 0.7], "Labour is very strong in going nowhere, but making a lot of fuss along the way.\nLDP is, unfortunately, not going to run in a snap election as remain AND win a majority.\nConservatives in the UK and in the US are well on track to self-destruct by not offering workable political solutions.\nMrs. May did not get much done, yet is doing well in maintaining power while others are stumbling over their own feet or not getting majorities behind them.

I view this as quite unlikely, given that it would signal the end of May's political career and would be an exit in extreme duress, destroying her tattered political legacy \n2) Vote of No Confidence: Conservatives held such a vote on 12 Dec 2018, which PM May survived. According to party rules, another vote may only be held after 1 year. A Vote of No Confidence could be triggered by Labour, but given Labour's 229 seats in Parliament (of 650), they would need a minimum of 34.5% of Conservatives to support, assuming all Lib Dems and other party members support the motion, which is highly unlikely. \n3) Agreement for a new general election: this would require 2/3 vote of all MPs - extremely unlikely, given the split in Parliament.  Of the PMs since 1940, the avg PM tenor in office is 4.9 years, w/ a standard deviation of 3.0 years. As of 1 Jul 2019, PM May would have a tenor of ~3.0 years, which carries at ~25.5% probability, given the sample.  As a baseline, also important to consider that in the reference period (from 1940), there have been 8 party changes, on average every 9.8 years. Therefore, I'd consider the baseline probability of a PM change in any ~6 month period of time to be ~ 10% (0.5 years / 4.9 years), w/ a ~5% chance of a party change in the same period (0.5 years / 9.8 years).

There cannot be much chance that she can get her EU Withdrawal bill through parliament (close to 0%) and if she does not surely she should resign (10%). If she does not resign surely Corbyn would call for a Parliamentary Vote of No Confidence (30%) which he might or might not win (50% win). If May won a Parliamentary Vote she could carry on, if not she has a couple of weeks to try and sure up her support before having another vote. So there is only about a 20% chance that May would lose both No Confidence Votes. Even if she does lose both she is still in the game because then there would need to be a General Election and according to the polls the Conservatives could still be the biggest party (not because May is viewed as a good PM, but because Corbyn is not viewed as potentially a good PM). My feeling (based on no data) is that more voters could hold their nose and vote Labour to stop May, than could hold their nose and vote Conservative to get May, but this might be because most people I talk to see Corbyn as useless, but May as dangerous. Corbyn's mistakes could be put right later, May's would last for a generation. \nSo my thinking is if May can get past a Parliamentary No Confidence Vote she could hang on. If she loses a Parliamentary No Confidence Vote she might hang on in an election. Although May has got a lot of Conservatives MPs who have no confidence in her, they see that voting No Confidence in the Government (as opposed to voting No Confidence in May as Conservative Leader) would probably mean Corbyn became PM and there was a Labour government. So Conservative MPs are unlikely to vote with the opposition in a Parliamentary No Confidence Vote, An additional reason for Conservatives not to vote No Confidence in the Government is that the outcome could lead to a General Election in which MPs could lose their seats. \nBut its difficult to see how May could command day to day control of her party if she fails to get the Withdrawal Agreement through, and difficult to see how she gets thrown out!"], [34353, "2018-12-31T14:17:40Z", [0.15, 0.05, 0.05, 0.75], ""], [745, "2018-12-31T13:47:07Z", [0.15, 0.15, 0.15, 0.55], ""], [925, "2018-12-31T13:15:29Z", [0.55, 0.2, 0.0, 0.25], ""], [691, "2018-12-31T12:51:28Z", [0.35, 0.09, 0.0, 0.56], ""], [60463, "2018-12-31T11:42:54Z", [0.25, 0.5, 0.0, 0.25], ""], [675, "2018-12-31T03:39:52Z", [0.0, 0.51, 0.19, 0.3], ""], [24617, "2018-12-31T01:51:11Z", [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.7], ""], [63795, "2018-12-30T22:00:29Z", [0.06, 0.13, 0.01, 0.8], ""], [56, "2018-12-30T19:55:55Z", [0.2, 0.08, 0.02, 0.7], ""], [15674, "2018-12-30T19:33:48Z", [0.55, 0.45, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2018-12-30T19:15:35Z", [0.16, 0.21, 0.22, 0.41], ""], [60666, "2018-12-30T16:44:15Z", [0.6, 0.1, 0.0, 0.3], ""], [63852, "2018-12-30T14:38:33Z", [0.2, 0.05, 0.0, 0.75], ""], [1333, "2018-12-30T10:22:43Z", [0.16, 0.21, 0.23, 0.4], ""], [17875, "2018-12-30T06:06:57Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.0, 0.99], ""], [63558, "2018-12-29T16:29:09Z", [0.15, 0.11, 0.01, 0.73], "I know nothing of the UK Parliament or the election process. Hopefully by the end of this I will know something. To find a baseline I did some research into the United Kingdom Parliament and prime ministers from 1772 to present. From the information I found there have been 76 Prime Ministers. Of those 76, 15 have lost office. 11 coming from a vote of no confidence and 4 coming from resignation. That sets the probability that Theresa May will lose her position from either of those things at .197 probability. Next I looked at when these events happened, were they replaced by someone in their own party, or by someone from another party? of the .197 of position losses .33 went to their own party and .66 to another party. That puts me at a .065 probability it will go to someone in the Conservative Party and .13 probability it will go to someone in the Labour party. These two parties have dominated for decades dating back to at least 1935 and that is questionable to me since I don\u2019t know if there is a difference between the Labour Party and the National Labour Party. For the sake of the math and not believing that anything is impossible I will give the remaining parties and .002 probability of taking the Prime Minister office. To sum up the baseline, 6% - Yes, someone from the Conservative Party\n13% - Yes, someone from the Labour Party\n1% - Yes, someone from a party other than the Labour or Conservative parties.\n80% - No Looking through some of the top comments these numbers seem to be loosely in line with others who may be more educated on this topic. Considering that a vote of no confidence has already taken place, this cannot happen again until beyond the question deadline. That would mean that Theresa May will have to resign. From the information I could find that has only happened 4 times since 1772 which would increase the probability of \u2018No\u2019 to .9474. Each time a Prime Minister has resigned they have been replaced by someone of their own party so the probabilities in order become .05, .00, .00 and .95 respectively. Obviously there are a lot of outside factors, but these are good numbers to be aware of going forward. Theresa May has strongly indicated that she will be stepping down before her term ends in 2022, but has been determined to see Brexit through before resigning which is set for March 29, 2019 and a transition period following. The other possibility is the Labour Party could also call for a vote of no confidence and oust her and cause a snap election, but this would also require her own party to essentially bring down their own government.  Right now it seems that the front runners to replace her are Boris Johnson from the conservative party, and Jeremy Corbyn from the Labour Party. It seems to me that Corbyn has more control over the situation than Johnson because he could force a general election which he has shown signs of doing in recent days/weeks.

She's survived years of very serious criticism, a flubbed slap election in which she decreased her majority, opportunism in her own party, and most recently a no confidence vote. Another no confidence vote cannot take place for a year, so Brexit cannot dethrone her procedurally, she would have to step down. Here are the scenarios I imagine: 1.  The pressure from a bad Brexit deal forces her to step down before Brexit takes place (23%) the replacement is a member of the conservative party.\n2. She survives Brexit but the deal is so bad that she is forced to step down, by pure political pressure (5%), the replacement is a member of the conservative party.\n3. She survives Brexit but is not able to make an attractive post-Brexit agenda, she is seen as the \"Brexit prime minister\", and people in her own party force her to step down, the next PM is a conservative (5%)\n4. The situation around Brexit forces another snap election, the outcomes for that I predict are:\n4a. Given how shallow the Conservative bench is and how well Corbyn energizes his base, Labor wins and Corbyn becomes PM (7%)\n4b.

Parliament could vote in a new PM without a general election. They could also decide to call a general election even though they don't have to (I estimate 70% probability for this). If the vote of no confidence in the government as a whole is successful, there has to be a general election.\n4) In case of a general election, assuming that it will be a tight race, so 50% Conservatives win, 49% Labour wins, 1% other (see below) (http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/ , thanks @Futureseeker)\n5) In either a general election or new PM election case, I am assuming an outside chance of 1% for PM from neither of the big parties.
