There will be more killings in CAR before 2019, and the numbers will easily reach 1000 dead : but will these be targeting civilians in a single campaign, as defined in EWP guidelines? Factors that include an increase of tension include : \n- Between 2013 and 2015, the UN concluded that there was between 3000 and 6000 dead  (but it was not labelled \"genocide\" and would not answer the definition).\n- In April 2018, about 30 people were killed in attacks led bu the CAR forces and the MINUSCA jointly.  In May, there have been at least 25 dead in the PK5 district of Bangui. More tensions are to be predicted : the 1000 people mark will be easily reached incrementally. Should tensions reflame, this mark might also be reached. \n- EU and French missions to bring peace have been retreating and ceding prerogatives to MINUSCA but their track record for peacekeeping is lower. \n- Russian \"advisors\" have been working in collaboration with the CAR government but they have no incentive (historical, religious or economic) to prevent killings should they take place. \n- In 2013, Seleka members were estimated at 12 000 people ; anti-balaka ranged from 20 000 to 75 000 : killings in these two rival factions only could total higher than 1000 but civilians would not be directly targeted as per EWP definition. \n- In 2017, more than 80% of the country was divided under the control or influence of one of the 14 armed groups.  Limitations : \nAt once, killings tend to be less than 50 people killed at once. Those deaths are almost always framed as combattant death. Mass killings reach the hundreds but it remains unlikely that a mass campaign would kill 1000 civilians in one go and in once location.
