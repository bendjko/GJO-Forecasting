That saying means a fighter was close to a knockout, but spent too much energy trying to obtain a knockout and his power heavily decreased.  Burundi has the landmass of a small US state, with an unhealthy population of 11 million people.  War crimes are a constant and genocide of the Tutsi people was in the memorable past.  In my opinion, Burundi is \"punched out\" when it comes to genocide.  Systematically killing 1,000 or more civilians requires organization and Burundi appears to be extremely chaotic.  I find it probable, but unlikely that a group from within Burundi systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians in Burundi before April 1, 2018.
