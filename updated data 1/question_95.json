Ms. Suu Kyi is constitutionally barred from being a candidate. But her National League for Democracy is expected to use its overwhelming legislative majority to install a candidate from its ranks who is likely to have little of Ms. Suu Kyi\u2019s stature and whom she has already stated she will control from behind the scenes.\nThe new president will be the first to lead a democratically elected government whose leaders are untainted by military links since the armed forces seized power in 1962. The new government follows a nominally civilian transition regime of former generals who ruled from 2011 but were defeated in the November election in which the NLD swept both houses of parliament. The NLD hasn\u2019t said who it will offer up as a candidate, and party leaders have offered only vague clues. Win Htein, a central executive committee member, has said that Ms. Suu Kyi \u201ccannot be president\u201d and has suggested only that the candidate\u2019s name will have two words.

Not concerned about time zones.  A tiny bit of history.  President Obama has been sworn in three times.   How can he have had three when he has only had two terms?  Chief Justice Roberts screwed up the first oath in 2009.  The wording was wrong but President Obama followed along and said the wrong words.  Embarrassing to say the least.  Later that night, out of an abundance of caution, the CJ and President redid the oath without mistakes.  I believe the President signed either legislation or an executive order again also out of an abundance of caution.   Most Constitutional law experts said the second oath was unnecessary because the U.S. Constitution says the President begins the term on January 20th at noon.  By operation of law, President Obama became President at noon on January 20, 2009.  Nothing, even botched oaths, can affect that. That makes a lot of sense.  No country ever wants there to be even a second that they do not have a President (or equivalent).  I think that is a fair statement of government and one that is important in my analysis of this question.  The continuation of a stable government is the goal here.  Based on President Obama\u2019s multiple oaths and what I know about the U.S. system, I wondered what the Myanmar Constitution says about Presidential terms.  Granted, there is system is different and they do not have a set day and time like the U.S., but my same thoughts apply to their President\u2019s start time. The relevant portions of their Constitution say:   60. (a) The President shall be elected by the Presidential Electoral College. And  61. (a) The term of office of the President or the Vice-Presidents is five years.\n(b) After the expiry of the incumbent term, the President and the Vice-Presidents\nshall continue their duties until the time the new President is duly elected.\n(c) The President and the Vice-Presidents shall not serve more than two terms.\n(d) An interim period to serve as the President or the Vice-President shall not\nbe counted as one term of office.\n(e) If a vacancy is filled for the President or the Vice-President for any reason,\nthe term of office of the new President or the new Vice-President shall be up\nto the expiry of the original term of office. Let us assume that they do in fact elect a President from the NLD prior to the expiration of the current term.   According to the link from @Clinton, the last President assumed office on March 30, 2011.  So at midnight on March 30, 2016, if there is a duly elected President, he or she \u201ctakes office\u201d or assumes the Presidency by operation of law, just like President Obama in 2009.

In Myanmar,  that are two hugely different things, as mentioned in the description: The parlamentary elections were conducted in November. It took until February for the elected members of the parliament to take office. So the \"take office\" part is the interesting one here. The new president will likely be elected in March, but he will seemingly only take office on April 1. April 1 has been circulating since some weeks and been mentioned by the office of the president as the date for the transfer of power now. Or at least by a speaker of the office. According to a report (yes, some uncertainity here). I also asked a Journalist from Myanmar and the date seems pretty fixed according to him (besides that there are no official candidates yet of course & nobody, including myself, guaantees anything AND March 31 continues to pop up on some pages >_> ). Note that before the March 17 nomination-date was set, it has been regarded widely as self-evident that the new president would be nominated &  elected in February \"as one of the first acts of the parliament\". Note further, that the new parliament also did not taker over immediately from the old one alhough this indeed happened a bit faster than expected. How did this question develop so wrong?\nAccording to an extensive ICC report (from the end of 2015) on the election in Myanmar, president Thein Sein term ends on March 30 and he was correspondingly expected to step down on March 30.  The successor needed to take office on March 31 (no clue why there is a gap of one day, but that's how it was planned according to the news paper reports. I expect it's a ceremonial-thing.). That was the situation when the question was posted and thus the question maked sense (I started with 90%, then raised it to 99% through december, then started to drop it; raised it again and then kept it down...). However, Thein Sein decided to step down on March 31 in the meanwhile (around the end of december; no reason at all), thus moving the date for the inauguration of the new president to March 31 or, more likely, to April 1. I wondered if they just thought that having no president for one night might be strange and thus both events have been rearranged to the same day. If April 1 is correct now, that wasn't the case.

As I understand they are still very much afraid of the transition to come and the time thereafter with all it\u2019s unpredictable consequences they might face. So far Suu Kyi was not so much known as a compromising person but a very strong character. In the current transition process she seems to manage the situation in a very conciliatory manner, what also reflects in the first fewc nominations of last week in the new parliament. http://www.dvb.no/news/suu-kyi-pleased-with-first-days-of-new-reign/60607 The NLD also faces a still-powerful military, which is granted 25 percent of parliamentary seats -- giving it an effective veto on charter change, as per the current constitution.  However it still seems almost a given that finally the president will finally be nominated from the NDL, but possibly not Suu Kyi, due to the need of changing the constitution.  There seems not much hope that this will happen before the due date, and give way to the nomination of Suu Kyi, however this is not relevant to the question.  Another aspect I am taking in consideration is the fact, that there are no really free press reporting about inside Myanmar. Neither the outside sources nor the english speaking in side news paper give a true picture.

He is a close friend of Shwe Mann, the former speaker of parliament purged from the junta-linked Union Solidarity and Development Party last year and now a key Suu Kyi ally.\nSuch a temporary suspension, the thinking goes, could allow Suu Kyi to become president without formally changing the constitution, which requires the votes of more than three-quarters of parliamentarians - so giving the military, which holds 25 percent of seats, a veto - and a national referendum.\nWhile Myanmar's post-independence 1947 constitution allowed for the suspension of articles, the 2008 charter, which has been criticized as vague and open to interpretation, makes no mention of it. \"In our constitution, there's no provision saying whether or not 59 (f) can be suspended,\" Aung Ko told local media in December. \"In such a case, the law can be suspended.\"\nLEGAL GREY AREA\nKo Ni, the NLD's legal expert, as well as Nyan Win, a senior NLD official and Suu Kyi's legal advisor, said they thought the parliament could suspend the article with a simple majority. \"There is an informal way (to amend the constitution) in which we have to enact a special law to temporarily suspend the provision in 59 (f). This law can be enacted by 51 percent of votes at the Union Parliament,\" said Ko Ni.\nIt was unclear whether the top NLD ranks are planning to table such a proposal.

Though a fixed military presence remains, the NLD gets to choose the president. Outgoing President Thein Sein pledged to recognize the will of the people and said: \"All duties would be transferred to the next government systematically according to the schedule. We will make sure it will be smooth and stable without having to worry about anything.\" However - and this may be the only obstacle - Aung San Suu Kyi is banned by the constitution to take over the presidency. She repeatedly declared, that a solution for that could be found and she would make all decisions anyway. That can mean two things: Either Aung San Suu Kyi aims at amending the consitution or at selecting a loyal replacement. Both options could prove to be time consuming, since she either way would need the support of the parliament and the issues could brake party lines.
