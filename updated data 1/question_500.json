They said it was unclear what Wang\u2019s title would be and whether he would remain on the powerful seven-member Politburo Standing Committee. The other four said he would probably step down. The party signaled last year that the rule was not binding. However, deferring retirement would raise questions about whether Xi, 64, would himself use that as precedent to retain his roles as party and military chief beyond completion of the traditional two five-year terms. Another possible scenario is that the retirement age for Chinese officials would be extended to 70, the sources said. Wang could therefore retain his Standing Committee seat and head the National Supervisory Commission, a super-ministry that would absorb the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) he now heads. After an absence from the spotlight in the summer, Wang has been increasingly active in recent weeks, meeting with high-profile foreign visitors. Some analysts and party insiders said it was possible Wang would simply retire, as precedent dictates.\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-congress-wang/chinas-xi-looks-set-to-keep-right-hand-man-on-despite-age-idUSKBN1CG0JI\n________________________________\nCOMMENTS:  Some PRO & CONS on whether Wang Qishan would stay on. \nWhat resonate with me is:\n1.
