I think we are looking at late spring to summer,\" Spicer told the newspaper in an interview during Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny's visit to Washington late last week. \n[1]http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-trump-tax-idUKKBN16Q0AD [2]https://www.senate.gov/legislative/2017_schedule.htm\nhttp://www.house.gov/legislative/"], [34321, "2017-03-19T22:01:51Z", [0.7], ""], [34410, "2017-03-19T20:36:24Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-03-19T19:14:31Z", [0.0], ""], [10692, "2017-03-19T18:49:22Z", [0.02], ""], [19801, "2017-03-19T11:04:03Z", [0.45], "http://fortune.com/2017/03/15/donald-trump-tax-reform-gop/"], [498, "2017-03-18T21:44:06Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2017-03-18T20:46:55Z", [0.0], ""], [28091, "2017-03-18T17:24:25Z", [0.27], ""], [691, "2017-03-18T15:14:36Z", [0.0], ""], [11057, "2017-03-18T14:00:14Z", [0.06], ""], [34395, "2017-03-17T22:56:27Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-03-17T19:53:15Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-03-17T17:20:42Z", [0.0], ""], [11057, "2017-03-17T12:52:55Z", [0.0], ""], [5386, "2017-03-17T09:14:56Z", [0.01], ""], [33035, "2017-03-17T03:40:15Z", [0.02], ""], [29646, "2017-03-17T02:10:27Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-03-16T20:56:31Z", [0.0], ""], [28414, "2017-03-16T20:27:57Z", [0.0], ""], [31082, "2017-03-16T20:27:18Z", [0.01], "No way Trump administration will obviate the costs for lunatic electoral promises in such a blunt way."], [32836, "2017-03-16T15:30:50Z", [0.08], ""], [30364, "2017-03-16T13:47:43Z", [0.4], ""], [691, "2017-03-16T12:07:22Z", [0.0], ""], [31374, "2017-03-16T12:06:39Z", [0.0], ""], [32840, "2017-03-16T01:27:44Z", [0.05], ""], [9755, "2017-03-16T01:04:07Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-03-16T00:48:34Z", [0.0], ""], [500, "2017-03-15T21:49:33Z", [0.0], ""], [1207, "2017-03-15T21:39:02Z", [0.0], ""], [16355, "2017-03-15T14:31:40Z", [0.04], ""], [16355, "2017-03-15T14:31:28Z", [0.02], ""], [10994, "2017-03-15T12:06:12Z", [0.15], ""], [34358, "2017-03-15T01:43:26Z", [0.0], ""], [754, "2017-03-14T22:33:30Z", [0.0], ""], [14033, "2017-03-14T20:34:54Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-03-14T17:59:33Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-03-14T15:58:44Z", [0.0], ""], [4992, "2017-03-14T14:51:39Z", [0.0], ""], [26375, "2017-03-14T11:02:19Z", [0.0], ""], [28904, "2017-03-14T00:49:26Z", [0.1], "There are some positive comments at http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/27/news/economy/border-adjustment-tax-trump-trump-congress/, but it doesn't look like it has enough Senate support: http://thehill.com/policy/finance/322971-flake-becomes-latest-gop-senator-to-raise-concerns-about-border-tax-proposal. \nHowever, based on the question, Either the Senate OR the House would need to pass this in the next ~45 days.

The House leadership favours a 20 per cent BAT which would tax domestic sales, exempt exports and deny deductibility for imports. House speaker Paul Ryan - backed by economists - argues the policy would be pro-economic growth and not protectionist because the US dollar would rise up to 25 per cent due to the tax's impact on trade and capital flows. However, several Republican senators oppose any import tax because of concerns it could raise consumer prices or ignite an international trade war between countries. . . . Fiscally-conservative Republicans in Congress insisting on revenue neutral tax reform are worried Mr Trump will dodge slashing the government's $US19 trillion gross debt and may even add to it.\n. . . \n\"The \"skinny\" budget due in March will not be a complete fiscal document and be bereft of tax reform revenue projections, the President's budget director Mick Mulvaney said. The tax details are expected to be contained in a separate publication after the mini-budget, once the Congress agrees how to fix the divisive Obamacare health insurance law. \"For budget purposes we have to do healthcare before we do a tax cut,\" Mr Trump said, \"because we have to know what the healthcare is going to cost\".

That may speed up this legislation. There are clearly two different camps of thought on this issue (cited below).  I'm not sure (hence my 39% probability forecast)  for two reasons: (1) April 30, 2017 is 7 weeks away. There's a lot going on in Washington, albeit it could be fast-tracked.

So what is going to happen is companies are going to come back here, they\u2019re going to build their factories and they\u2019re going to create a lot of jobs and there\u2019s no tax.\u201d\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-interview-highlights-idUSKBN1622RG Trump may not fully understand it, but he does, somehow, reach the same conclusion promoted by knowledgeable proponents. It's ridiculous that the United States has not leveraged its large and lucrative domestic market for its own benefit. There is meaning in semantics, and It might help, a bit at least, if people considered themselves to be \"purchasers\" within an integrated system, recognizing their inherent purchasing *power*, rather than isolated and dis-empowered \"consumers.\" Despite its origin within the GOP, this is really a true populist item, designed to benefit the common good, the entire commonwealth. Clear sighted Democrats should be supporting this, but it is possible that they won't be able to see beyond their resistance to Trump to embrace this item of empowered democracy. In addition to the immediate economic benefits, I would personally welcome the increased manufacturing innovation and increased product variety that might reasonably be anticipated to be spurred by such an approach. My forecast remains low primarily due to timing. Edit/Update1: Here is the most succinct correct statement that I have seen so far of exactly what (at least one version) of the border adjustment tax actually is: \"The so-called border adjustment tax would revamp the corporate tax code, preventing companies from deducting the cost of imports from their taxable incomes\"\nhttps://www.buzzfeed.com/matthewzeitlin/companies-adding-trump-related-risk-factors?utm_term=.qtYEyOm4q#.bmE3n90JP In regard to the Buzzfeed article, corporations are well advised to make these disclosures of political risks. As an aside, can you imagine the nightmare which would have likely ensued under the \"investor protection\" clauses if the United States were bound to some of the macro regional trade agreements (e.g, TTIP and TPP)? In a speech today Trump vowed to make the GOP \"the party of the American worker,\" which is simply an astounding aspiration. These free trade deals have been the result of an alliance between the \"establishment\" of both political parties. American workers were sold out for special corporate interests, with the entire society suffering the deleterious effects (Ross Perot was right), covered by the sop of lower prices. That the Democratic party leadership betrayed their base constituency (domestic labor) and threw them under the bus to obtain benefit from a corporate clique, and are now being challenged by Trump over this key historical constituency is just simply amazing. I don't like Trump, consider him to be no more than a front for Russian-dominated organized crime, but on this one issue -- a populist approach to political economics -- he's correct (imo). I do worry that he's the wrong messenger for such an important message, which makes getting to the point where such a populist political economic program would demonstrate its merit very precarious; or that the good may suffer from association with the bad; or that Trump is being used, as he so often (willingly and knowingly) has been, to somehow set it up for failure; or that he will find some Trumpian way to perhaps go too far and screw it up. One more bit of assurance to those who may be reluctant to embrace this conception: the business does not go away! It is simply redistributed. Edit/Update2: Gary Cohn, chief economic advisor to President Trump, says \"no go\" on border adjustment tax\nhttps://www.axios.com/trump-econ-advisor-no-go-on-house-border-adjustment-tax-2282642439.html It is not surprising that Cohn, ex-President of Goldman Sachs, has come out against the border adjustment tax. If we understand corruption to be the selling out of \"the many\" by betrayal of some duty of protection inherent in some organizational role (whether fiduciary or in some weaker form of organizational trust) for the benefit of \"the few,\" we see that much of the Goldman Sachs business model is to act as corruptor to various \"insiders\" (the would-be corruptees) [think of the Greek debt, a private \"deal\" affecting public resources; or, as is common in insider-trading and bankruptcies, such as Trump's initial Manhattan Conrail property acquisition, where he was, I believe, the channel to siphon the benefit of the corruption]. By eliminating a systemic vulnerability, a border adjustment tax would radically change a condition of the system which Goldman Sachs relies upon for their approach. It would be much harder for them to extract profits from a broader set of diffused transactions (with the vulnerability [risk] of exploitation [via corruption] similarly diffused), among other things. Yet, there remains some glimmer of hope in that the White House has not, so far, come out in direct opposition to the House GOP plan. As is becoming expected with the Trump administration, there appears to be two opposing camps on \"border adjustment\" generally. For the sake of clarity, in future forecasts I will use the term \"border adjustment tax\" to mean the stronger, more populist (the equal protection of everyone's interests) House GOP plan (or at least that version of which I am familiar), and adopt the term \"border adjustability tax\" to refer to the weaker, less populist (allowing special interests to prevail) plan which the likes of Cohn et. al. might come up with. Obviously, since the latter term is adopted from the language of the White House, you can see that I am not optimistic that the stronger, better, plan will succeed. --\n\"In many cases, the entities involved have more resources than the countries they target and exploit.\"\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2017/02/23/us-uk-must-target-law-firms-facilitating-african-corruption/#f008eba12289 In a better world, the U.S. would be leading such an initiative, rather than letting struggling nations such as the Republic of Guinea flounder amongst the sharks.

Perdue \"previously served as the CEO of Dollar General, a company that imports heavily.\" A Senator is, nominally, charged with representing the interests of his/her entire state, as well as keeping an eye on the interests of the entire country. Instead, Perdue adopts the parochial perspective of a retailer that has built its business model around imports from China. One of my first posts on GJO was about how I was surprised that so-called \"Dollar Stores\" carried plastic drinking straws imported from China. Together with a few other forecasters we explored the economics of this. Contrary to the arguments of Perdue, the border adjustment tax would incentivize firms to have those straws made in America, which will add (or rather return) displaced jobs, increasing the overall economy, and allowing the greater volume of transactions to help everybody (as those workers spend their wages, and that spending is spent, and so on). Stores such as Dollar General are in a sweet spot, having optimized supply chains that reach into Communist party controlled factories in China. That they do not wish to give up the gravy train is understandable. But that Perdue, a U.S. Senator, should sell out his constituents in Georgia, and the citizens of the United States, is unforgivable. Stores such as Dollar General can adjust, but they'd rather maintain an inverted tax system to keep their near-monopoly via the Communist Chinese leadership. They are fat and lazy. \"If you go to a system like this, you're going to get massive economic growth\"\nhttp://www.weeklystandard.com/too-complicated/article/2006775#! I agree. MASSIVE is right. If people would just invest some time in understanding it, they'd see for themselves. Even CNBC, a cable network with roots as a financial news service, mistakenly (misleadingly?) describes the border adjustment tax as a \"proposal [which] would put a 20 percent tax on imports.\" But just because it is slightly more complicated, it's not that difficult to understand at all. More American workers. More investment in Plant & Equipment. More transactions, across-the-board. All businesses, as well as the workers, do better. In addition, and this point is often overlooked, there will be more diversity in all product offerings. Instead of the single Chinese source optimized to make \"basic\" product X with only the most basic standard features for the product category, you will have all sorts of variety and choice. I am not optimistic such a \"tax\" will be passed within the timeframe. I am also skeptical that the current crop of politicians won't find ways to pervert it in such a way so as to turn a really good thing into, as Trump says. a \"disaster.\""], [25997, "2017-02-10T03:07:19Z", [0.02], ""], [691, "2017-02-10T02:59:17Z", [0.01], ""], [33577, "2017-02-10T00:44:48Z", [0.05], ""], [33562, "2017-02-10T00:41:35Z", [0.05], "A border adjustment tax might be part of a larger corporate and individual tax package passed later in 2017."], [915, "2017-02-10T00:30:54Z", [0.0], ""], [32766, "2017-02-09T21:38:40Z", [0.15], "This is a tariff by any other name, isn't it?

The key to understanding this tax is to recognize that most Americans are both producers and consumers. By incentivizing American sourcing, thus increasing the demand for American production and workers, there will be more money (greater velocity of transactions) within the domestic economy which will, in general, increase the demand for *all* goods and services. The slightly more expensive tee-shirt at Walmart would be offset for that Walmart consumer by (first, having a job! and second, by) a wage increase (as a producer), and more than offset for that very same consumer by lower direct taxes to support non-productive workers in the economy. It will also drive major investment in plant and technology within the United States. It really is a better approach to corporate taxation than the model the U.S. currently uses, and would reverse the position of the U.S. getting \"ripped off\" (as Trump rightfully laments) by leveraging the size of the domestic market for the benefit of all citizens. On this one point Trump is exactly correct. The rest of the G7, in private, must really think the U.S. is a bunch of fools for having current tax and trade policies that are so disadvantageous to U.S. citizens. It's the only tax approach that prevents a (potential) increase in standard of living being turned against the very citizens whose productivity drove the increase in the standard of living in the first place. Even if Trump comes around to embrace this \"not-thought-of-here\" GOP tax plan, I don't currently believe legislation could pass either body before 30 April. This might change, however, if the rest of the Trump agenda continues to face sagging support, and he needs to breath new life and enthusiasm into his so-called \"movement.\""], [33433, "2017-02-05T23:20:37Z", [0.35], ""], [32563, "2017-02-05T22:33:53Z", [0.65], ""], [6276, "2017-02-05T22:28:41Z", [0.65], ""], [4518, "2017-02-05T22:25:18Z", [0.0], ""], [16554, "2017-02-05T22:19:13Z", [0.05], ""], [5386, "2017-02-05T21:25:09Z", [0.05], ""], [32814, "2017-02-05T21:12:10Z", [0.1], ""], [23190, "2017-02-05T21:03:15Z", [0.05], ""], [17036, "2017-02-05T20:34:59Z", [0.05], ""], [28414, "2017-02-05T20:24:33Z", [0.05], ""], [16501, "2017-02-05T19:47:02Z", [0.05], ""], [12459, "2017-02-05T19:34:02Z", [0.05], "Highly unlikely that Congress will have that on a priority list by the end of April."], [19253, "2017-02-05T19:15:55Z", [0.1], ""], [29970, "2017-02-05T19:03:52Z", [0.05], ""], [7053, "2017-02-05T18:58:14Z", [0.05], ""], [30344, "2017-02-05T17:29:28Z", [0.8], ""], [6373, "2017-02-05T17:15:03Z", [0.05], "The only rationale for a Border Tax is to pay for the \"Wall\" which won't be started (regardless of Presidential edicts) as it will bog down in the Government procurement process.
