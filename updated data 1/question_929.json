The only push for Russian Ministry of Justice to list more media outlets is if the US puts sanctions on Russian media outlets. A question I have been struggling to find an answer is how many other US-funded media outlets are operating in Russia except the already listed as foreign agents? And how many foreign media outlets in numbers and percentages in contrast to domestic media outlets operate in Russia? What I could find out is that the press and internet media is the only possibility for foreign-funded media to use at the moment, as according to multiple sources and especially the report made from Harvard,  94% in shares in television is hold by the state; ( https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/shleifer/files/media.pdf ) while the main read newspapers are actually Russian such as Metro,Moskovsky Komsomolets, Rossiyskaya Gazeta. (https://www.indexoncensorship.org/2013/12/brief-history-russian-media/) and same goes for radio as well - the most listened are Russian owned radios. Another factor to consider is the relations between Russia and the US at the moment and are there any possibilities of Russia listing more media outlets. Such forecast is very volatile as the US-Russia relations are very fragile, however, following the meeting between  the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov - both sides are working to collaborate and optimize their relationship.

In December 2017 Russia declared nine US based Russian media outlets as foreign agents. It was an answer to the pressure coming from the US government. Special Counsel Robert Mueller and several congressional committees emphasized that Russia\u2019s been involved in the 2016 US presidential election and the charges were disclosed against 13 Russian and three Russian companies.  \tNo further amendments have been made to a law that allows Russian authorities to designate international media outlets as \u201cforeign agent\u201d. No more media outlets have been added to the list after December 2017 either. Needs to be noted, that it\u2019s known that in order to be added on the list, organization needs to receive foreign funding. So, I believe that media outlets operating in Russia are capable to sufficiently mitigate the risk of being designated. However, since it\u2019s not easy to predict the actions of Russian government, I think there\u2019s still a chance that they might add designated media outlets on the list mainly because the publishing of the Muller report might have its consequences. Also, the US has announced that next week they\u2019re going to introduce a bill that will target entities involved in the construction of the Nord Stream 2. Moreover, there are some discussions about Russian interference in the upcoming European Parliament elections. If the EU reacts to the issue the way the US did, Russia might increase the number of media outlets on the list in response.

Furthermore, it is also very unlikely that one of the media outlets will shut down or that one of the subsidiaries will be closed soon.   The 5% percent for \"11 to 20, inclusive\" is based on the existing probability that tensions will increase further. A possible scenario could be that the EU will designate or sanction Russian media outlets based on accussations that these tried to manipulate or interfere in the upcoming EU election. However, with the Brexit still going on and the short period of time, it seems  unlikely that the EU will be sanctioning new entities in May which means in return that it is also unlikely that Russia will designate new Western media outlets.

In my original forecast, I further argued that only because the number of registered media has been stable so far, this does not mean it has to continue to be that way. I particularly pointed towards the EU elections and Russian interference, which could cause further mutual counter-measures (see original forecast), which could lead to new media outlets on the list. In my opinion, this argument still holds true. However, I also pointed towards the danger of domestic instability in Russia as motivation for further additions to the list (see original forecast), as well as, a worsening relationship with the US. However, both points have to be relativized due to the limited amount of time left till June, 1. On the one hand, I could not find any events, expected to provoke drastic riots in Russia in this period of time. On the other hand, with Trump's Russian affair finding an end, and his focus on the Chinese trade war at the moment, I don't see a big escalation potential there this month either - maybe a small one regarding Venezuela. Thus, I furthermore reduce the chances of additional media outlets on the list. Over all, I estimate not an 80% chance of 8 to 10 media outlets on the list on June 1, 2019.

Also, because these media outlets were added in under a month after the passage of the law, it makes me suspect that the Russian government had been monitoring media outlet's funding and already knew which ones were \"foreign agents\".  Therefore, I suspect the reason more haven't been added is because there aren't any more that were present before 2017. It also suggests that this once more of a one time law that was meant to send a message, but since then has been forgotten about and lawmakers have failed to enforce it since.  Therefore, in order to be added to the list a previously \"non foreign agent\" media outlet would have to receive foreign financial contributions. I find this highly improbable, because no Russian Media outlet would willingly want to take steps to be added to this list and then face attack. Therefore, they would have to be in dire financial trouble to accept this consequence. It isn't impossible but from now to June 1st I would give it only a 2% chance of happening.   Another way a media outlet could be added would be if it is a new media outlet that is receiving foreign support in order to get off the ground. However, the long term consequences of being on this list and being subject to government harassment would not make a good sustainable business model. Therefore, I find this also an unlikely scenario, one which only has a 3% chance of happening by June 1st.  The last scenario would be if a foreign government purposely set up and funded a Russian media outlet. I do find this more probable than the other two option due to the fact that this enterprise wouldn't care if is discriminated against and harassed by the Russian government, because they are deliberately trying to subvert the government and would reasonably expect retaliation. However, I do find it unlikely that it would happen, because most government who would want to do this to Russia are Western Democracies that have a system of checks and balances to prevent abuse of power. This makes decisions like this harder to make and set up. Furthermore, the foreign government would be setting up this media outlet in full knowledge of its failure due to the hostile Russian environment, thereby questioning whether it would be a good use of money. For these reasons I give this scenario only 5% chance of happening by June 1st.

With that being said I do believe that there is a slight chance, 25 percent to be precise, that some media outlets can be added to the list. I have not given any percentage to any of the reduction options, as I find it unlikely that the Russian government will reduce the list, seeing as the relationship between Russia and the West has not improved since the creation of the list. Another aspect I have taken into account is the fact that Russia in July 2018 passed a law that makes it possible for them to label individual journalists as foreign agents (source: https://europeanjournalists.org/blog/2018/07/05/russia-passes-new-law-to-label-individual-journalists-as-foreign-agents/). This law also gives the government the right to block websites and blogs without a court ruling. The law signals that Russia has not improved its relationship with foreign media, which again strengthens the argument that they will not reduce the list.

Its establishment was seen as a direct response to the US after the US requested Russia Today, a state-funded Russian media outlet, to register itself as foreign agent pursuant to the \u2018Foreign Agent Registration Act\u2019. The register and the new focus on media outlets by Russian regulators might have been a novelty in this form, however, the underlying legal structure mirrors laws which aimed at NGOs by requesting them to register as \u201cforeign agents\u201d (2012 version) and later on allowed the Russian authorities \u201cto prosecute foreign non-governmental organisations (NGOs) or firms designated as \u2018undesirable\u2019\u201d (BBC 2015). Since then, the number and the targeted entities remained the same (9 media outlets). Meanwhile, the number of targeted NGOs declined from 135 entities in 2016 to 74 in 2018 as external funding stopped or Russian branches of Western NGOs closed (researched by user @mbayer123). In what extent this decrease has an effect on the assessed probability will be elaborated in the following paragraphs. Furthermore, it is important to consider the remaining time of less than 2 months for the forecast due to its minimizing effect on the probability of an extreme change in the trend. As a logical result, the options which \u2018border\u2019 the most likely outcome seem to be more likely than the extremes at the edges.  The first option \u201cLess than 3\u201d equals a lift of the imposed sanctions by Russia on Western media outlets. Regarding the current tensions in US-Russia and EU-Russia relations it seems unlikely that Russia, the US or the EU would lift its sanctions programs. A unilateral action by the Russian Federation to display good will seems unlikely, too. As a result, this forecast assesses this event as a black swan with a likelihood beneath 1% to represent the theoretical possibility of this scenario. However, in this forecast, the probability for option 1 will be assessed as 0% or in other words as \u2018practically non-existent\u2019.  Option 2 \u201c3 to 7, inclusive\u201d doesn\u2019t merely depend on a lift on sanctions. The following two developments explain how this scenario could happen. First, it is possible that the sanctioned media outlets will stop operate due to frozen external funding, increased bureaucratic obstacles or through the prosecution of its employees and assets by Russian authorities. While all factors are valid, their critical impact on the designated media shouldn\u2019t be overestimated. All stated media outlets are state-funded by the USA (or represent subsidiaries of the state-funded beneficiary owner) which eliminates the economic pressure to always work profitable in order to sustain their business. Furthermore, the named media outlets specialised themselves to operate in civil rights oppressed environments and, hence, have the expertise and willingness to face state oppression. The forecast at hand assumes that this is a main difference between the designated media entities and the NGOs which stopped to act within Russia. As a result, the declining rate of NGOs doesn\u2019t represent a valid reference class for this case. Another development which might lead to delistings by the Russian Federation could be improved relations to the USA and the EU. Delisting entities might be a bargain in future cooperation negotiations. However, under the current situation it seems very unlikely that tension will decrease enough in order to initiate such a political development as it would be a 180\u00b0 turn in the foreign policy of all involved parties. Reflecting these circumstances: this forecast will assess the likelihood for \u201c3 to 7, inclusive\u201d with 1% as it represents a practically possible outcome compared to option 1, but it remains a very unlikely one nonetheless.  Since late November 2017 there were no further designations of media outlets as foreign agents. The designations of Western media might have been a one-time-response to the US\u2019 demand towards Russia Today in order to display protest against this request and to fuel dissents. Another possible assumption is that the Russian government tested this form of sanctions and concluded that they weren\u2019t effective enough. This would explain why the Russian Federation didn\u2019t designate further media outlets as foreign agents despite several US/EU-policies which could be used as justification (e.g.: expansion of sanctions program against Russia). As a result, the probability that the number of sanctioned media organisations remains \u201c8 to 10, inclusive\u201d, while considering the low likelihood for a reduction mentioned above, must be high. Another argument for a high probability is the relative constant relations between Russia and the US/EU (only recently!). While remaining suspicious towards each other, none of the involved parties dared to confront the other party directly (sanctions should be seen as an indirect tool of foreign policy. Furthermore, the nature of the imposed sanctions by the US & EU are sectoral sanctions which represent a \u2018soft\u2019 form of economic isolation. As a result, only specific Russian entities and individuals are sanctioned but not the entirety of the Russian economy or society).   A slight increase is assessed to be unlikely in general (challenged by the third option), but more likely than a slight decrease in the number of designated entities. The main reason for this difference is based upon the current declining relations between all involved parties. This option\u2019s probability depends on the occurrence of possible and realistic events which inherit negative impacts on the relations mentioned above. Conflicts like the war in eastern Ukraine, in Syria and in Libya boost a more hostile stance of Russia towards the West as both sites support different actors in each war theatre. Also, possible Russian disinformation campaigns targeting the EU elections and other general elections across Europe comprise the potential to devastate the relations further. E.g.: a block of Russian social media accounts which are suspected to be state-owned fake accounts could motivate the Russian government to expand its sanctions on Western media outlets. The likelihood of further declining relations is limited by the rare use of this specific sanction tool in the past. For this purpose, the option \u201c11 to 20, inclusive\u201d will be assessed to have a probability of 10%.  A sharp increase seems also very unlikely as it represents like option 1 an extreme event. This scenario seems only plausible in the event of black swans (e.g.: sudden rise of public mass protests in Russia which threaten to overthrow the government could lead to a block and expulsion of foreign media by Russian authorities as they might expect an involvement of Western states). Like option 1, this scenario, \u201cMore than 20\u201d, is theoretically possible (assessed with less than 1%) but will be excluded as \u2018practically non-existent\u2019 with 0%.  To conclude, a drastic reduction or increase of designations, which are rooted in extreme scenarios, are \u2018practically non-existent\u2019. The 10 times higher likelihood of a slight increase in comparison to a slight decreased is mainly based on current relations dynamic between the involved parties favouring the former. This forecast assesses that the number of designated entities will very likely remain stable and that this scenario is only challenged by unlikely events such as black swans. As a result, it will be assessed with an 89% probability and is, hence, (~) 9 times more likely than the second most likely option.

In its original form, it concerned only non-governmental organizations with foreign funding and political activities. In November 2017, it was extended to media outlets. For an adequate estimation of the number of registered media outlets on June 1, 2019, the forecast at hand will consider three things: first, the reasons for the establishment of the law and its extension respectively, the numbers of registered organizations on the list, as well as the reasoning for corresponding labeling and finally, the differences between NGOs and media-outlets will be reviewed.\nThe introduction of the law, in the first place, had primarily domestic reasons, namely the mass protests between the parliamentary and presidential elections in winter 2011/spring 2012 (https://www.dw.com/de/was-ausl%C3%A4ndischer-agent-in-den-usa-und-russland-bedeutet/a-41469379). However, already in 2012, official statements referred to the US Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA) that itself registers foreign lead organizations and demands disclosure of their finances and activities in the US (https://www.dw.com/de/ngos-in-russland-angeschlagen-aber-ungeschlagen/a-41454896). The amendment of the law and its corresponding extension on media outlets in 2017 were then in fact a direct consequence of the worsening relations between the US and Russia. Washington accused Moscow of having influenced its presidential election in 2016 - also with the help of the state-controlled and financed media outlet RT. As a consequence, RT had to register as a \"foreign agent\" under FARA on November 13 following a request by US authorities. The Kremlin regarded this as an attack on Russian media and interests and introduced the media law only days after the incident.  \nToday, April 6, 2019 there are 74 organizations registered as foreign agents in Russia (http://unro.minjust.ru/NKOForeignAgent.aspx), as well as 9 media outlets (https://minjust.ru/ru/deyatelnost-v-sfere-nekommercheskih-organizaciy/reestr-inostrannyh-sredstv-massovoy-informacii). While the media outlet list has not changed since December 2017, when exclusively US affiliated media outlets were labeled as foreign agents, only days after the introduction of the law, the corresponding NGO list has faced more changes. While the law was introduced in July 2012, it was not before June 2013 that the first organizations were correspondingly labeled, so round about a year later (http://unro.minjust.ru/NKOForeignAgent.aspx), after preceding public searching of NGO offices in spring 2013. Throughout the years the number of foreign agent changed since many of the affected organizations stopped foreign funding or were dissolved. In July 2016, for instance, there were still 135 organizations on the list (https://www.boell.de/de/2016/09/13/zivilgesellschaft-russland-wo-unterstuetzung-von-aussen-lebensnotwendig-wird), in November 2017 87 (https://www.dw.com/de/ngos-in-russland-angeschlagen-aber-ungeschlagen/a-41454896), and as of today, as above mentioned, 74. The important implication for the forecast at hand is that only because the number of registered media has been stable so far, this does not mean it has to continue to be that way. Both, increased domestic struggles for the regime, as well as tensions with other states could motivate Russia to add other media outlets on the list. Particularly, important in this context is the high degree of uncertainty in terms of the future of Russian US relationships, on the one hand, and the upcoming EU parliament elections in May 2019, on the other hand. If the EU should experience aggressive Russian experience this could lead to corresponding actions and ultimately to a fast Russian reaction, as happened after the US elections.  Based upon this analysis, the forecast at hand, the forecast at hand comes to the following conclusion: Less than 3 is estimated to be highly unlikely, as of 1%, due to the tensions in Russian US relations that keep getting worst, as well as the elaborated possible consequences after the EU elections. A 4% likelihood is attributed to Answer #2 - 3-7, since it cannot be completely excluded that two of the listed media outlets might stop operating in Russia. Due to the past stability of the list, as well as the fact that there only two months left till the question\u2019s deadline, a relative stable domestic situation in Russia, and the small timeframe of actions in terms of a potential EU-Russian conflict after the EU elections before the question\u2019s deadline, the forecast at hand estimates a likelihood of 60% for 8-10 listed media outlets. It considers the probability of 11 to 20 registered media outlets as half as likely to realize but in the realm of the possible. A 5% likelihood - as much as the first two options together - is given to the last option - in case of a complete escalation of the situation. \n"], [63409, "2019-04-06T00:19:13Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.89, 0.1, 0.0], "Updating for passage of time"], [691, "2019-04-05T14:59:58Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.84, 0.16, 0.0], ""], [691, "2019-04-04T18:08:08Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.84, 0.16, 0.0], ""], [23006, "2019-04-04T02:17:06Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.92, 0.08, 0.0], ""], [67416, "2019-04-03T08:58:47Z", [0.0, 0.16, 0.79, 0.05, 0.0], "The the law has been passed there have been 9 agents on the list. \nThe new bill that allows to classify individuals as foreign agents and the law on NGO's as foreign agents is used now a days.

Considering a very short time period, it is very unlikely that there will be any changes in International Relations that could have an effect on the list. Especially, knowing that on March 5, 2019, Trump already extended U.S. sanctions against Russia for one more year. Hence, Russia had time to respond to it. \n11-20, inclusive - 5%.

Furthermore, more than a technical measure based on facts it looks like a political response to US measures adopted in relations to the allegations that Russia interfered in last U.

Therefore, I assess an 80% chance that on 1 June 2019 such members of the list will be between \u201c8 to 10, inclusive\u201d.  That said, I leave a little window of posibility since the highly degree of unpredictability of the Russian international relations and dynamics. For instance, a sudden sharp stiffening of the American-Russian relationship might lead Russia to extend the list. The same is true for the European-Russian relationship, especially with the upcoming European elections and the recent accuses toward Russia of trying to manipulate the Election (in particular by France and Macron).  On the other hand, even though unlikely, it cannot be completely excluded the reverse outcome, namely a d\u00e9tente between Russia and the West in general. Such an outcome might lead the Kremlin to remove some or all the members of the list.

First, France will Harden its politics towards the Russian media present in the country. A report published on September 4, 2018, entitled \"The manipulation of information: a challenge for our democracies\", from the Foreign Ministry, invites the French government to \"name and isolate\" organizations that act as \u00ab\u00a0 foreign propaganda organs\u00a0\u00bb. It is explicitly suggested that journalists from Russian news organizations, such as RT and Sputnik should not be accredited or invited to press conferences.\nIn addition, President Macron judges that the over-media coverage of the \"Yellow Vests\" crisis is a \"manipulation\", orchestrated notably by Russia and RT France. According to him, there is manipulation of the extremes, with the help of a foreign power (source: https://www.lepoint.fr/politique/emmanuel-berretta/macron-elysee). Sputnik and RT have not been accredited by LREM (Macron Party) to cover its European elections campaign.\nFor the moment, Moscow has not yet taken binding decisions on France, but could very well be retaliated by June 2019 if the situation gets even worse, by appointing France Media World, including France24 and the RFI radio station, as a foreign agent. This can very well increase the number of the list, easily exceeding 10. Secondly, just a few months before theEuropean elections, governments warn against possible Russian media interference in the campaign, fearing its impact in countries with particularly divided views (Source: https://www.lapresse.ca/international /europe/201902/28/01-5216459-lombre-dune-possible-ingerence-russe-plane-sur-les-elections-europeennes.php). In this clash of information, on the eve of the European elections, Western media may find themselves in the list in retaliation for sanctions by Europeans of Russian media. Third, Canadian media could also be named, because of Canada's refusal to accredit Sputnik and RIA Novosti journalists for the Lima Group meeting on Venezuela. Thus, there is no probability for proposal less than 9 media on the list, the highest probability for 8 to 10, inclusive, and for 11 to 20, there is also, I think, some good probabilities, it is not so unlikely to happen.
