Please critique! Here we go\u2026 First, what is the relationship between 1 month LIBOR (1ML) and the Federal Funds Target Rate (FFTR)? It appears that the 1ML is equal to the current FFTR plus the expected value of the next rate change. For example, before the March 31st rate decision, the 1 month LIBOR was pricing 35 basis points over the then current FFTR (1.5% at the time). This roughly breaks down to a 100% chance of at least one 0.25% hike, plus a 60% chance (0.15%/0.25%=0.6) of another 0.25% hike on top of that. Now, for a quick check on this, we can look back over the past five years (2013-now). Doing so, we can see that the mean difference between the 1ML and FFTR before an actual hike by the FOMC was 0.2% (the market was pricing in an 80% chance of 0.25% hike on average). This makes sense. Second, what is the market currently pricing in? Basically a 0.25% hike, as the difference (1ML \u2013 FFTR) is 0.25% exactly. If rates are increased on the 13th, then what do we expect this diff to be? Historically the 1MML is very close to the FFTR right after a hike which makes sense \u2013 the market has nothing really to price in as the FOMC takes into account all current data at the date of the meeting. So the expected value of the next meeting is close to zero right after a hike.  It appears to me that the current forecasts are way too high \u2013 again correct me if my analysis is wrong. The most likely scenario is that the 1ML stays very close to 2% up until the meeting and through the meeting (assuming the expected 0.25% hike). Jobs numbers are great, and potentially we get another rate hike later this year. Thus we are likely to lean slightly over 2% than under.  Interesting notes:\n*Bill Gross thinks June will likely be last rate hike this year. Look up his recent TV appearance. \n*Current market probabilities of rate hikes: http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html\n"], [58312, "2018-06-05T13:30:33Z", [0.05, 0.2, 0.4, 0.3, 0.05], "Rates should continue to rise, US will have to inflate itself out of its debt"], [691, "2018-06-05T11:29:52Z", [0.0, 0.03, 0.3, 0.67, 0.0], ""], [25141, "2018-06-04T12:08:24Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [25141, "2018-06-04T11:59:02Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.85, 0.15], ""], [691, "2018-06-04T11:15:33Z", [0.0, 0.07, 0.31, 0.62, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2018-06-03T15:43:37Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.35, 0.5, 0.1], ""], [691, "2018-06-03T12:30:37Z", [0.0, 0.07, 0.3, 0.62, 0.01], ""], [29980, "2018-06-03T02:51:14Z", [0.9, 0.05, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2018-06-02T15:15:02Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.35, 0.45, 0.05], ""], [4681, "2018-06-01T21:06:59Z", [0.02, 0.1, 0.58, 0.29, 0.01], ""], [691, "2018-05-31T17:38:10Z", [0.0, 0.09, 0.28, 0.62, 0.01], ""], [42162, "2018-05-29T18:39:41Z", [0.0, 0.06, 0.15, 0.5, 0.29], ""], [42162, "2018-05-29T18:39:04Z", [0.0, 0.06, 0.15, 0.4, 0.39], ""], [691, "2018-05-29T12:31:37Z", [0.0, 0.19, 0.3, 0.51, 0.0], ""], [691, "2018-05-28T16:00:55Z", [0.0, 0.19, 0.29, 0.51, 0.01], ""], [691, "2018-05-27T12:00:15Z", [0.0, 0.19, 0.29, 0.51, 0.01], ""], [691, "2018-05-26T12:50:18Z", [0.0, 0.19, 0.28, 0.51, 0.02], ""], [58507, "2018-05-25T20:26:10Z", [0.25, 0.39, 0.22, 0.14, 0.0], ""], [58507, "2018-05-25T20:25:09Z", [0.2, 0.35, 0.25, 0.15, 0.05], ""], [58308, "2018-05-25T15:27:08Z", [0.0, 0.3, 0.05, 0.25, 0.4], ""], [1333, "2018-05-25T14:44:28Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.45, 0.45, 0.05], ""], [35636, "2018-05-25T05:15:07Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.8, 0.0], "It is 1.95% now, going on a 25bps raise by Jun 29th.
