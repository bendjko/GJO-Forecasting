Whitford and Benisek v. Lamone, two partisan gerrymandering challenges. In neither of these rulings did the court directly address whether a district map can be struck down as unconstitutional for giving one political party advantage over another. Instead, today's rulings were made on standing grounds (as in Gill) or procedural grounds (as in Benisek).\nGill v. Whitford: The court ruled unanimously that the plaintiffs \u2014 12 Wisconsin Democrats who alleged that Wisconsin's state legislative district plan had been subject to an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments \u2014 had failed to demonstrate standing to bring a complaint under Article III of the United States Constitution. Chief Justice John Roberts penned the majority opinion, in which Associate Justices Anthony Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan joined. Kagan filed a concurrence, which was joined by Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor. Associate Justice Clarence Thomas filed an opinion, joined by Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch, that concurred in part with the majority opinion and the court's judgment.\nRoberts noted that the court's opinion did not address the question of whether partisan gerrymandering claims are justiciable:\nIn cases where a plaintiff fails to demonstrate Article III standing, we usually direct the dismissal of the plaintiff's claims. This is not the usual case. It concerns an unsettled kind of claim this Court has not agreed upon, the contours and justiciability of which are unresolved. ... We therefore remand the case to the District Court so that the plaintiffs may have an opportunity to prove concrete and particularized injuries using evidence\u2014unlike the bulk of the evidence presented thus far\u2014that would tend to demonstrate a burden on their individual voters.

But when it comes to cases involving reapportionment\u2014challenges to how states draw lines for congressional or state legislative elections\u2014the justices can\u2019t be quite so choosy. Congress has chipped away at the cases subject to mandatory review by the Supreme Court, but it has kept it for redistricting cases where an election looms and time is of the essence. If skewed electoral maps may need to be redrawn, a special three-judge federal court is convened to hear the case; an appeal goes right to the Supreme Court, bypassing America\u2019s 13 circuit courts.  This quirk of Supreme Court procedure explains why the justices have now agreed to hear four gerrymandering cases this term, including two added on January 12th. These recurring matters may be their least-favourite to resolve. In 2016, Justice Stephen Breyer told lawyers in a racial-gerrymandering dispute that he had hoped his majority opinion in a similar 2015 case \u201cwould end these cases in this court\u201d. But Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v Alabama \u201ccertainly doesn\u2019t seem to have\u201d done so, Justice Breyer rued then. And, apparently, 2017 rulings in Bethune-Hill v Virginia State Board of Elections and Cooper v Harris haven\u2019t done so either. The latest disputes over electoral lines come from Texas and are, in election-law expert Rick Hasen\u2019s words, \u201ccrazy with details\u201d. Both cases ask whether race improperly influenced the state legislature\u2019s map-making and both\u2014to make things more confusing\u2014are styled Abbott v Perez. (Greg Abbott is the governor of Texas; Shannon Perez is an Hispanic voter who lives in Bexar County.) But the two cases address two different maps\u2014one for congressional districts, another for state legislative districts\u2014and involve slightly different claims of racial unfairness. Last August, a ruling by a three-judge panel in San Antonio held that two of Texas\u2019s 36 congressional districts were drawn to minimise minority voting power, in violation of both the Voting Rights Act and the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of the \u201cequal protection of the laws\u201d. In District 27, covering Corpus Christi, Texas\u2019s 8th-largest city, Hispanics were \u201cintentionally deprived of their opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice\u201d. District 35, meanwhile\u2014a skinny, long district resembling the nation of Chil\u00e9\u2014showed signs of an \u201cimpermissible racial gerrymander\", line-drawing based predominantly on racial considerations. Texas countered that its gerrymander was merely partisan, not racial, but the court roundly disagreed.  Nine days later, on August 24th, the same federal court found that several state legislative districts\u2014on a map to elect lawmakers to the Texas House of Representatives\u2014did not pass legal muster. Two districts in Dallas were found to be \u201cpacked\u201d with Hispanic voters, decreasing Hispanic voting power in nearby areas. Other districts were specifically designed to \u201ccrack\u201d Hispanic voter strength by parcelling minority voters into a number of districts where their voice in each would be faint. The Texas legislature, the court concluded, aimed \u201cto ensure Anglo control\u201d of the vote in these parts of the state. The remedy to these discriminatory maps, the court held, was a new set of maps to be drawn by the legislature in a special session last autumn. But Texas quickly asked the Supreme Court to temporarily block those orders, and, by a 5-4 vote, it did. Now the cases will get a full consolidated hearing on the merits, probably in late April, as the justices wind down their 2017-2018 argument schedule. With these additions to the Supreme Court\u2019s docket, late June will probably bring a trio of highly anticipated decisions on the contours of gerrymandering in America.   The justices have already heard Gill v Whitford, a challenge to a partisan Republican-drawn gerrymander in Wisconsin, and they will soon consider a partisan map favouring Democrats in Maryland in Benisek v Lamone. Those cases mark the justices\u2019 first opportunities in over a decade to decide whether maps drawn to marginalise voters from one party violate the constitution\u2014and will help resolve an especially brazen Republican effort in North Carolina to rope Democrats out of contention for congressional races. Together with the race questions in Abbott v Perez, the justices have their hands full clarifying the statutory and constitutional limits on electoral-map cartography. But it\u2019s a safe bet that whatever the court says this spring, it won\u2019t be the justices\u2019 last word on the subject\u2014much to their chagrin.\" Democracy in America\nJan 15th 2018by S.M. | NEW YORK\n(copyright 2018) (fair use)  So my reasoning is partisan redistricting by House Majority Leader Tom Delay\nhas shaped Justice Kennedy's  (POMP) along with Viera.\n So bad Travis County prosecuted then House majority leader Tom DeLay\nJustice Kennedy in concurring opinion in split decision.\nbased on discrimination  in violation of  Voting Right tossed one legislative  map and articulated standards for drawing new maps involving compactness.\nSee https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/05pdf/05-204.pdf\nBelieve this is a minefield and  this 2006 Texas plurality opinion  while Sec.2 voting rights case is instructive\nthere is a test: \nJustice Kennedy :\"Based on the foregoing, the totality of the circumstances\ndemonstrates a \u00a72 violation.

This means we start with a 45% chance of yes on the base rate. It looks like Justice Kennedy is likely to be the deciding vote (assuming 4 liberal judges and 4 conservative judges vote with party lines), and he laid out a criteria for what he considers to be gerrymandering. \"Justice Anthony Kennedy concurred with the ruling of the court to uphold the District Court's decision maintaining that cases of political gerrymandering were not justiciable. He did not, however, foreclose the possibility that judicially manageable standards for gerrymandering could be developed in future cases before the Court.\" (from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vieth_v._Jubelirer) The rule seems judicially manageable to me, though I'm uncomfortable with its dependence on party affiliation as intrinsic to its definition of gerrymandering. My intuitions around gerrymandering are that you can tell that something is gerrymandered without reference to the election outcome, that defining whether or not something was gerrymandered based on the outcome is problematic, and that its operation depends more on a two-party system than is typical in constitutional rules. So I'm increasing a little bit to 50%. https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-10-05/how-justice-kennedy-could-give-both-parties-a-win A law professor that I respect thinks Kennedy is reasonably likely to to agree, which increases to 55%.

Whitford, the case that has been submitted to the Supreme Court already after being accepted on certiorari to effectively answer the question posed.   The four liberal justices (Kagain, Sotomayor, Breyer, and Ginsburg) will almost certainly vote to affirm.  The four conservative justices will almost certainly vote to remand.  Justice Kennedy, who wrote a concurrence in Vieth in 2004 welcoming a \"manageable standard,\" essentially asked litigants to come to the Court with that manageable standard.  That's five votes, if he gets the manageable standard he wants. That puts me at about 55% .  There has never been a judicially appropriate manageable standard before.  That strikes me as reducing the likelihood by about 20% --> 35%.  The standard the plaintiffs proposed is not terribly difficult to administer, and is moderate enough in application that courts will not be routinely overturning partisan districts, a significant concern of the court.  I assign an increase in likelihood of 15%, not as powerful or persuasive as the absence of any judicially manageable standard in the past, but quite strong --> 50%.  Two concerns raised in the case are of little merit.  First, there is a standing question that may force the court simply to dismiss on justiciability grounds.  I reduce by 1% on this.  I find it very, very unlikely that the case would have been accepted on cert if the standing issue hadn't already been researched and addressed.  There is also the question of the Court's concern about mathematical and scientific thinking, but I don't include Justice Kennedy in that concern, and I think the standard here has relatively painless math.  Again, only 1%.  --> 48%.  Finally, Kennedy is a human being, and there is a significant chance that he looks at the current state of politics nationally, the probability that the next seat on the court will be taken by a strongly conservative justice, and the possibility that political gerrymandering will reach a spiral of one-party rule, and determine that this is the time to act even if there is not a judicially manageable standard.  I see these things as increasing the likelihood by 31% --> 79% I would assign a 10% likelihood that either (a) another justice (such as Roberts) joins the four liberals on statesmanship grounds, or (b) another legal rationale (such as the republican form of government clause) becomes relevant and is taken up by someone like Alito or Gorsuch.  I would assign an almost 0% likelihood that any of the four liberal justices abandon ship.  -->89% I would also note that Kennedy is now starting to think about his legacy, there are rumors that this is his last term, and he is generally a pretty practical justice.  He sees the harm of political gerrymandering and is likely to be persuaded by the challengers' approach.  +4% --> 93%.   I finally detract 5% because my own political leanings likely cause me to view the challengers' arguments as persuasive, and I have a desire to see a holding that it is unconstitutional.

More importantly, I doubt that expert witnesses will be able to provide certainty around cause and effect, or the size of the effect of gerrymandering vs political shift in opinion; and whether any Supreme Court judge will be able to use existing legal tests in any meaningful manner. However, the resolution to this question hinges on whether SCOTUS rules that any part of of the redistricting plan is unconstitutional. I suspect a 5-4 majority will find that the intent of the redistricting plan (which is pretty clear cut) is discriminatory; If that's the case, then how does the court redress the grievance? In other words, how does the court tell Wisconsin to fix the redistricting without prescribing law? By lack of imagination, (a weak argument, but a factual one at this time), I don't think it can.

He was skeptical in oral argument on the standing issue, so it's not a 100 % that there even is standing. In fact, finding that there is no standing would be a sort of a clean escape for SCOTUS from a politically charged issue. But let's say it's 75 % because Kennedy has been inclined to decide this type of a case before. The plaintiff was a Wisconsin voter at least. The court was offered various mathematical/statistical standards for evaluating district maps. The Wisconsin map is perhaps obviously gerrymandered but what about the next case and the next map that is slightly more ambiguous. Even so, the court doesn't necessarily need to settle on a proper clear-cut standard. If Kennedy is adamant to throw the Wisconsin map out the window, he can base his decision on the standard of, say, \"no extreme gerrymandering\", which would be almost useless in future cases but would tilt this case the right way.

I thought Justice Scalia sounded exasperated with Justice Kennedy in the following opinion with which Kennedy merely concurred in the result but declined to provide Justice Scalia with a 5th vote that would've foreclosed challenges to all partisan gerrymandering cases as political questions that courts have no capacity to decide.  Justice Scalia opined: \"JUSTICE KENNEDY recognizes that [the Court] ha[s] \"demonstrat[ed] the shortcomings of the other standards that have been considered to date...\" He acknowledges, moreover, that we \"lack ... comprehensive and neutral principles for drawing electoral boundaries\"; and that there is an \"absence of rules to limit and confine judicial intervention.\" From these premises, one might think that JUSTICE KENNEDY would reach the conclusion that political gerrymandering claims are nonjusticiable. Instead, however, he concludes that courts should continue to adjudicate such claims because a standard may one day be discovered.\" Vieth v. Jubelirer, 541 US 267, 301 (2004) (internal citations omitted).\n---------\nComment: Here are some facts quoted by the District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin's 118-page opinion (the dissent is pp. 119-158) that might help satisfy Justice Kennedy's apparent wish that the Court might one day craft a standard that had not yet been discovered at the time of Vieth v. Jubelirer: \"The drafters [of Wisconsin's electoral districts] created spreadsheets which collected the partisan scores, by district, for each of the statewide map alternatives. Each spreadsheet included a corresponding table comparing the partisan performance of the draft plan to the prior map drawn by the Baumgart court, which they called the \u201cCurrent Map.\u201d These performance comparisons were made on the following criteria: \u201cSafe\u201d Republican seats, \u201cLean\u201d Republican seats, \u201cSwing\u201d seats, \u201cSafe\u201d Democratic seats, and \u201cLean\u201d Democratic seats.\" (page 11 of the pdf opinion via SCOTUS Blog link in question summary.) \"The drafters [of Wisconsin's electoral districts] used their composite score to evaluate the statewide maps that they had drawn based on the level of partisan advantage that they provided to Republicans. In many instances, the names of the maps reflected the level of partisan advantage achieved by the districting plan; for instance, there are maps labeled \u201cAssertive\u201d and  Aggressive.\u201d Foltz testified that \u201caggressive\u201d in this context meant \u201cprobably that [the map] was a more aggressive map with regard to GOP leaning.\u201d (pp. 10-11 of the pdf opinion via SCOTUS Blog link in question summary.)\n--------\nJustice Scalia's above-quoted opinion in Vieth v. Jubelirer was joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist, and Justices Thomas and O'Connor. Justice Ginsburg joined Justice Souter's dissent; Justices Breyer and Stevens filed separate dissents.

As technology advances, the Supreme Court cannot ignore it\u2019s impact and throw its hands in the air, but will need to modernize its thinking. I don\u2019t think this is lost on Kennedy who said in a case 2 years ago that gerrymandering goes against democratic principles. Roberts is concerned that the SC will suffer its reputation and will get too many cases putting themselves in the middle of politics (that he wants to stay above). Alito calls gerrymandering \u201cdistasteful\u201d and Gorsuch rubs steak salt in the wounds making it all sound so very elitist.  The conservative arguments advance a hands-up in the air approach -- closing their eyes to the problem, electing to do nothing about it. Simply suggesting that voters could go elect new representatives if they don't like what gerrymandering has done sounds alot like let them eat cake or in this case let them eat steak rub. This process that Kennedy knows has worsened over time will be proliferated if the Wisconsin map is allowed to stand, one that locks in the party, making protection of the party the primary concern and individual voters\u2019 rights secondary, their choices choked for years at a time. Affirm or Overturn?\nDo the least harm: There could either be a festival of copycat gerrymandering if this case is overturned or there could be many more SC cases if standards are not set.  Ginsburg defined this case not about technicalities (as Roberts calls sociological gobbledygook) but about fundamentals, our precious right to vote. Why bother voting when it all seems rigged? \"I think the hard issue in this case is, are there standards manageable by a court?\" liberal Justice Stephen Breyer said. He then defined the factors that might attract five votes: One-party control, partisan asymmetry, persistently partisan results, and maps that are among the most extreme in the nation. These seem fairly straight forward, not so much gobbledygook. Technology evolves, but apparently not Roberts. What's worse?\nI don't see Justice Kennedy going with the close your eyes and hold your nose approach after 13 years ago suggesting that the first amendment may be the way to approach this issue. Breyer describes a manageable standard. If Kennedy doesn\u2019t totally embrace the standard, he could still decide that Wisconsin (being the worst, most partisan map so far) will proliferate its bold approach and that much at least has to be stopped.  This would affirm for the first time that partisan gerrymandering is more than distasteful; it is destroying democracy by putting political party rights on a pedestal not to be touched, while individual voting rights are just words (in the Constitution and Declaration of Independence) that have become relics.

Id. \u201cFor that or other reasons, no bill to\nreapportion the legislature had been enacted into law\u201d by January 1992, leading several\nRepublican legislators to challenge the existing apportionment plan \u201cas\nunconstitutional and violative of the Voting Rights Act.\u201d Id. As a result, the federal\ncourt was asked to draft a new plan.\nIn an attempt to play a more limited role in the redistricting process, the court\n\u201casked the parties at the outset whether they had any objection \u2026 to [the court\u2019s]\nselecting the best of the submitted plans rather than trying to create [its] own plan.\u201d Id.\nat 865 (emphasis removed). Upon receiving these submissions, however, the court\ndetermined that the plans bore \u201cthe marks of their partisan origins.\u201d Id. at 865. It\ntherefore used parts of one Republican plan and one Democratic plan. The court plan\npreserved the strengths of the partisan plans, \u201cprimarily population equality and\ncontiguity and compactness,\u201d while \u201cavoid[ing] their weaknesses.\u201d Id. at 870. The plan\nremained in effect through the 2000 election.\nFollowing the 2000 census, a divided Wisconsin legislature again was unable to\nagree upon a redistricting plan. Arrington v. Elections Bd., 173 F. Supp. 2d 856, 862 (E.D.\nWis. 2001). In an ensuing law suit, the federal district court determined that \u201cthe\nexisting Wisconsin Assembly and Senate districts,\u201d which had not been redrawn since\n1992, were \u201cviolative of the \u2018one person, one vote\u2019 standard.\u201d Baumgart, 2002 WL\n34127471, at *1. A new plan was therefore necessary. The court considered sixteen plans\nthat had been submitted by legislators and other interest groups, but \u201cfound various\nunredeemable flaws\u201d in all of them. Id. at *6. The court therefore drew a plan \u201cin the\nmost neutral way it could conceive\u2014by taking the 1992 reapportionment plan as a\ntemplate and adjusting it for population deviations.\u201d Id. at *7. In making these changes,\nthe court attempted to \u201cmaintain[] municipal boundaries and unit[e] communities of\ninterest.\u201d Id. The \u201cBaumgart Plan\u201d was in effect from 2002 until 2010....Ottman, Foltz, and Handrick began drafting the map that would become Act 43\nin April 2011, after they received census data from the Legislative Technology Services\nBureau (\u201cLTSB\u201d).21 The LTSB also had provided them with computers loaded with the\nredistricting software, autoBound.22 Ottman described in detail how the software was\nused:\n[Y]ou would open up a plan that you\u2019d been working on or label a new\nplan and assign it the Assembly district that you wanted to work with and\nthen you could also pick a color that you wanted that Assembly district to\nbe. It\u2019s sort of like a color-by-number exercise. \u2026The drafters used their composite score to evaluate the statewide maps that they\nhad drawn based on the level of partisan advantage that they provided to Republicans. ..\" So the SCOTUS has before it evidence that the Wisconsin plan, Act 43, was deliberately created to benefit the Republican Party at the expense of Democrats and thus violates the law - One Person One Vote.  First and Fourteenth Amendments.  2.  Foundational Case Law \nThe Court is not about to overturn Reynolds v. Sims. In Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 577 (1964), the Court required \u201cthat a State make an honest and good\nfaith effort to construct districts \u2026 as nearly of equal population as is practicable.\u201d Later cases set a 10%\nthreshold: an apportionment plan with a maximum population deviation between the largest and\nsmallest district of 10% is presumptively constitutional; larger disparities create a prima facie case of\ndiscrimination, and the State must justify its plan. See Evenwel v. Abbott, 136 S. Ct. 1120, 1124 (2016);\nMahan v. Howell, 410 U.S. 315, 329 (1973) (approving an apportionment plan with a deviation of 16% in\nlight of the State\u2019s interest in \u201cmaintaining the integrity of political subdivision lines\u201d). From the lower court:\n\"Later cases refined the methodology by which courts evaluate claims of vote\ndilution. In Rogers v. Lodge, 458 U.S. 613 (1982), Burke County, Georgia, employed an\nat-large system of elections to determine its Board of Commissioners, rather than\ndividing the county into districts and allowing each district to choose a commissioner.\nId. at 615. African-American citizens in that county brought an action in which they\nalleged that the county\u2019s system of at-large elections violated their First, Thirteenth,\nFourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendment rights by diluting their voting power. The\ndistrict court held that, although the at-large electoral system was neutral in origin, it\nwas being maintained for invidious purposes and therefore ordered the county to be\ndivided into districts for purposes of electing commissioners.\nThe Supreme Court affirmed. It explained that districts violate the Equal\nProtection Clause when \u201c\u2018conceived or operated as purposeful devices to further racial\ndiscrimination\u2019 by minimizing, cancelling out or diluting the voting strength of\u201d\nminority populations. Id. at 617. These cases \u201care thus subject to the standard of proof\nCase: 3:15-cv-00421-bbc Document #: 166 Filed: 11/21/16 Page 33 of 159\n34\ngenerally applicable to Equal Protection Clause cases,\u201d specifically the \u201c\u2018quality of a law\nclaimed to be racially discriminatory must ultimately be traced to a racially\ndiscriminatory purpose.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 240 (1976)).\nDiscriminatory intent, however, \u201cneed not be proved by direct evidence,\u201d but may be\n\u201c\u2018inferred from the totality of the relevant facts.\u2019\u201d Id. at 618 (quoting Washington, 426\nU.S. at 242).\nApplying this standard, the Court \u201cdecline[d] to overturn the essential finding of\nthe District Court \u2026 that the at-large system \u2026 ha[d] been maintained for the purpose\nof denying blacks equal access to the political processes in the county.\u201d Id. at 627.\nEvidence of discriminatory purpose included the fact that no African American ever\nhad been elected despite \u201coverwhelming evidence of bloc voting along racial lines.\u201d Id.\nat 623\u201324. There also was evidence of historical discrimination in the form of literacy\ntests, poll taxes, and school segregation, id. at 624\u201325; of a disparity in socio-economic\nstatus that \u201cresult[ed] in part from the lingering effects of past discrimination,\u201d id. at 626\n(internal quotation marks omitted); and of county elected officials\u2019 unresponsiveness\nand insensitivity to African-American constituents, see id. at 625\u201326.158\nAlthough focused on racially discriminatory apportionment schemes, Fortson\nand subsequent vote-dilution cases establish that Equal Protection concerns arise when\napportionment plans \u201cminimize or cancel out the voting strength\u201d either of racial\nminorities or, as we have here, \u201cpolitical elements of the voting population.\u201d 379 U.S. at\n439 (emphasis added). Moreover, they instruct that vote-dilution cases are governed by\nthe same standards as other equal-protection claims, namely the plaintiffs must\nestablish both a discriminatory intent and a discriminatory effect....In an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, Justice Powell, joined by\nJustice Stevens, concluded that a redistricting plan violated the Constitution when it\nserved \u201cno purpose other than to favor one segment\u2014whether racial, ethnic, religious,\neconomic, or political\u2014that may occupy a position of strength at a particular time, or to\ndisadvantage a politically weak segment of the community.\u201d Id. at 164 (internal\nCase: 3:15-cv-00421-bbc Document #: 166 Filed: 11/21/16 Page 39 of 159\n40\nquotation marks omitted) (quoting Karcher v. Daggett, 462 U.S. 725, 748 (1983)\n(Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)). He believed that this conclusion\nfollowed from the principles articulated in Reynolds, namely \u201cthat equal protection\nencompasses a guarantee of equal representation, requiring a State to seek to achieve\nthrough redistricting \u2018fair and effective representation for all citizens.\u2019\u201d Id. at 166\n(quoting Reynolds, 377 U.S. at 565\u201366). He further explained that\n[t]he concept of \u201crepresentation\u201d necessarily applies to groups: groups of\nvoters elect representatives, individual voters do not. Gross population\ndisparities violate the mandate of equal representation by denying voters\nresiding in heavily populated districts, as a group, the opportunity to elect\nthe number of representatives to which their voting strength otherwise\nwould entitle them. While population disparities do dilute the weight of\nindividual votes, their discriminatory effect is felt only when those\nindividual votes are combined. Thus, the fact that individual voters in\nheavily populated districts are free to cast their ballot has no bearing on a\nclaim of malapportionment.\nId. at 167 (emphasis in original).\nApplying these standards, Justice Powell believed that the \u201ccase present[ed] a\nparadigm example of unconstitutional discrimination against the members of a political\nparty that happened to be out of power\u201d and would have found that Indiana\u2019s\nredistricting plan violated the Equal Protection Clause. Id. at 185....\" First Amendment and Equal Protection Clauses are both at play in Gill v. Whitford.  We have a finding of intent to discriminate.  That's factual.  It can't be disputed.  The question is whether it will be weighty enough on its face to be consistent with previous SCOTUS rulings. HOWEVER, we must take notice that the Court has ignored partisan intent gerrymandering in the past.  From District Court Judge Griesbach's Dissent: \"GRIESBACH, District Judge, dissenting. Through a secretive and one-sided\nprocess, the state Republican leaders who controlled the legislature used the latest\ncomputer software and political consultants to draw up legislative district maps with\nthe unashamedly partisan goal of winning as many seats as possible. The maps they\ndrew gave short shrift to traditional districting principles, often producing districts with\nunusual and suspicious shapes. The governor, also a Republican, quickly signed the\nact. The Republicans\u2019 efforts were rewarded when, in the very next election, they won\nmore than twenty percent more seats in the legislature than their statewide vote totals\nwould have suggested.\nThe state in question is Indiana, not Wisconsin. The procedure used to draw the\nmap in Indiana is identical to what led up to the enactment of Wisconsin\u2019s Act 43: in\nshort, it was crafted in secret by Republicans who, at least in Indiana, conceded that\nnaked political gain was their overwhelming purpose. It also allowed the Republicans\nto win far more seats than their statewide vote totals would warrant\u2014in the Plaintiffs\u2019\nparlance, a historically-high efficiency gap of eleven percent. Thirty years ago,\nhowever, the Supreme Court upheld the districts drawn by Indiana Republicans, with a\nplurality of the Court concluding that the Democrats had not shown they were\nsufficiently injured.1\n Despite these similarities, and despite the Court\u2019s clear reluctance\nto intervene in what are essentially political cases, the Plaintiffs ask this court to find\nthat Wisconsin\u2019s Act 43 is an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. \" What will this SCOTUS do?  I say it will uphold the District Court's ruling. \n"], [18762, "2017-10-04T12:01:06Z", [0.75], ""], [13979, "2017-10-04T11:34:57Z", [0.65], ""], [40552, "2017-10-04T05:09:10Z", [0.5], ""], [1646, "2017-10-04T02:41:09Z", [0.89], "https://twitter.com/imillhiser/status/915231293209792512"], [2965, "2017-10-04T02:11:33Z", [1.0], "don't quite know"], [30364, "2017-10-03T23:21:00Z", [0.35], ""], [32258, "2017-10-03T22:45:03Z", [0.65], ""], [37488, "2017-10-03T22:00:24Z", [0.4], "http://www.scotusblog.com/2017/09/argument-preview-justices-tackle-partisan-gerrymandering/\nhttp://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/03/supreme-court-gerrymandering-wisconsin-arguments-243401\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2017/10/03/politics/redistricting-supreme-court/index.html\nhttp://www.scotusblog.com/2017/10/argument-analysis-cautious-optimism-challengers-wisconsin-redistricting-case/\nhttps://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-supreme-court-takes-up-a-major-gerrymandering-case\nhttps://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2017/16-1161_bpm1.pdf"], [2965, "2017-10-03T21:55:14Z", [0.65], "@JMR2017 and @Seancarranco\nwe do our best  plus 3\nSee pic http://www.scotusblog.com/2017/10/view-courtroom-big-windup-partisan-gerrymandering/\nhigh drama until Kennedy gave the McCain signal a strong correct signal\nThumbs down on definitive statistics  for determining issue\nwe just crowd source one thing\nUS Const.\nall prior opinions and\ntalk is cheap ai will never supplant me and judges ever\nno lie detctor test instead of jury\nso many reasons this and us v texas played out\n 100 tomorrow\ninside strig just mssign one cward now\nwritten opin\n opinion that should be 80% minimum\nCrowd was wrong here\nbut I better come back to crowd on all else"], [2965, "2017-10-03T21:50:17Z", [0.65], "@Seancarranco @JMR2017\nNo true believers apply for gjo\nhere is what I think the opinion will do and narrow\nbut deep on First A\nits not 100 but Kennedy asked first  \nfirst how do i do the the least harm\nsee Hippocrates\nregime change\nBy the book as a superforecaster 66% \nis quite high here\ncrowds  right almost all the time\nsomeone has to point out stuff to keep the discussion going\n100 very effective at that elections\nelectoral college\nmany undefined unknowable unintended consequences\nsome intended in order to form a more perfect union\nfrom your post 4 upvotes\nON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS  MR. TSEYTLIN: I would like to begin  by answering Justice Kennedy's question.  A facially discriminatory law in a  state would violate the First Amendment because  it would stigmatize that party. This case - \nthis Court's cases could not be clearer that  when you have neutral lines -- neutrally,  facially neutrally lines, the question is not  of partisan intent, because there will always  be partisan intent.  The question is have the plaintiffs  presented a burden on representational rights  based upon a limited, precise,  judicially-amenable standard. There has been  nothing new presented to this Court.  Basically what the plaintiffs have  done here is they have taken Professor King's  amicus brief from LULAC, they have taken the  exact same central concept, partisan asymmetry,  and they've recycled it here. There is nothing  new before this Court.  Second, we have heard something about  the various tests that they are now proposing.  There was only one test that was subjected to  adversarial scrutiny in this case, in a  four-day trial. That efficiency gap test  proved so fatally flawed that the District  Court rejected it as the test and plaintiffs  abandoned it as the primary test on appeal.  And then my final point about the  scare tactics, about what will happen next.  Plaintiff's expert did a comprehensive study  from 1972 at the -- when the Baker  redistricting had happened, to 2014. And he - \nand you can look at that study. The chart on  that study is on Supplemental Appendix 227.  It shows that the asymmetry was worse,  was worse in 1972 than in 2014. You are always  going to have scare tactics. You are always  going to have partisan intent.  We have not had any advancement in  terms of what has been presented to this Court  since LULAC where this Court properly  criticized partisan asymmetry as not a neutral  standard that has uniform acceptance.  And we have asked for those reasons  for this Court to reverse the District Court.

Jubelirer - https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/541/267/opinion.html Although SCOTUS has recently ruled that gerrymandering based on racial lines is and always has been unconstitutional (limiting 1 group's access to equal to constitutional right to vote base on some [non-partisan/non-political] characteristic.  In the North Carolina case the defendants argued both that they used race to justify the redistricting (black voters should have enough of a majority to elect a candidate who can represent them) and that it was about politics (the weirdly long/thin district enabled the democrats to vote largely democrat and the republicans to vote largely republican).  SCOTUS ruled that it the redistricting was \"predominantly\" racial (not enough demographic change to justify political redistricting) and that racial gerrymandering has already been shown to be clearly illegal unless it can be shown as a mechanism to give minority black voters a majority to win a representative if they wouldn't otherwise have enough power to overcome  race-based majority who voted for another candidate (so it can be used to help them as a minority but not hurt them by limiting their influence across multiple districts).  It doesn't matter if black voters in the South tend to vote Democrat and that the intention could conceivably have been political and just happened to touch on race.  But the Justices' push to keep political partisan gerrymandering untouched, and  suggests that they didn't have any evidence in that case to change the previous rulings on political partisan gerrymandering.  The ruling did suggest that SCOTUS still intentionally is keeping political gerrymandering (\"legally permissible\") separate from racial gerrymandering (\"legally prohibited\"), but also suggests they see that when a single racial group generally overlays a single political party, there can be limitations on political gerrymandering as well. http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/05/supreme-court-north-carolina-race-gerrymander/\nhttps://electionlawblog.org/?p=92675\nhttps://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/15-1262 Footnote 6 of the recent Cooper v. Harris ruling in NC shows that Alito clearly felt that the argument that the goal was political gerrymandering and that the individual voters happened to be black was significant and related to  a prior precedent which was \"treated like a disposable household item\u2014say, a paper plate or napkin\u2014to be used once and then tossed in the trash.\"  And in their dissenting Alito, Kennedy, and Roberts made a point to explain that the only reason they took issue with one of the districts considered in the NC case was that NC made no effort to see if there were alternate voting district maps that would have allowed for political separation and less racial segregation.  They also argued that in previous precedents this case was not clearly different from other cases and they disagree that without distinction it should be treated as different/clearly racially motivated.  For them, \"partisan gerrymandering is always unsavory,\" that \"Under the Constitution, state legislatures have \u201cthe initial power to draw districts for federal elections.\u201d Vieth v. Jubelirer,\" that \"courts are obligated to 'exercise extraordinary caution in adjudicating claims that a State has drawn district lines on the basis of race.\u201d and that \u201cFederal-court review of districting legislation represents a serious intrusion on the most vital of local functions,\u201d and \u201cthe good faith of a state legislature must be presumed,\" and that \"evidentiary burden [to prove the state legislature did not act in good faith and did discriminate on race 'is a demanding one.'\"  More importantly, they state that the caution to have very clear evidence is important especially \"where the State has articulated a legitimate political explanation for its districting decision...\" It is clear that a strong minority very clearly still promotes the legality of political gerrymandering.  Maybe they are willing to accept the Wisconsin case because the lower courts are going against all previous precedents in arguing that political partisan gerrymandering is a violation of the 1st and 14th Amendments (when SCOTUS has already indicated that the 14th Amendment doesn't include political parties).  There are also several other cases in lower courts on similar partisan gerrymandering issues that could become issues.  The most significant difference in this case is the \"efficiency gap\" measurement that Stephanopoulos and McGhee came up with in 2014 which attempts a fair, since Kennedy said re: 2004 Vieth v. Jubelirer \u201cif workable standards [to fairly decide between 2 political parties on partisan gerrymandering] do emerge to measure these burdens \u2026 courts should be prepared to order relief.\u201d https://thinkprogress.org/the-most-exciting-attack-on-partisan-gerrymandering-in-over-a-decade-68ae8b6b2e5e/\nhttps://www.wired.com/2017/04/gerrymandering-illegal-mathematicians-can-prove/\nhttps://newrepublic.com/article/118534/gerrymandering-efficiency-gap-better-way-measure-gerrymandering\nhttp://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1946&context=public_law_and_legal_theory I think that the multiple rulings from SCOTUS ignoring or justifying partisan gerrymandering suggest that even with new \"statistical,\" non-partisan, and reliable method of calculating an \"efficiency gap\" of lost votes [between major parties], it will be remarkably hard to change precedent.  There is certainly good reason to hear the case now, with new evidence and a multitude of state elections (and recent national election) that were significantly influenced by majority Republican-controlled state legislators in states working hard to gerrymander local districts to support their party, so there will otherwise be any number of states whose cases might crop up in upcoming years.  Furthermore Justice Kennedy (the potential swing vote on this particular issue) my retire soon, so making the best case now while he is still on board is still better, even with unfavorable chances, than waiting a few years until President Trump has installed another, perhaps more conservative Justice in his place.  Stephanopoulos & McGhee indicate just how bad the chances have been in their preamble to their research: \"The usual legal story about partisan gerrymandering is relentlessly pessimistic. The courts did not even recognize the cause of action until the 1980s; they have never struck down a district plan on this basis; and four sitting Justices want to vacate the field altogether. The Supreme Court\u2019s most recent gerrymandering decision, however, is the most encouraging development in this area in a generation. Several Justices expressed interest in the concept of partisan symmetry\u2014the idea that a plan should treat the major parties symmetrically in terms of the conversion of votes to seats\u2014and suggested that it could be shaped into a legal test\" (see above, chicagobound.uchicago.edu/).  Although there may be more reason to hope now than there has been up to now, this is not sufficient to show that SCOTUS will choose to now call any political gerrymandering illegal based on 1st & 14th Amendments.  And it seems that the comments in the recent NC ruling show that several justices are still very clearly skeptical or resistant to considering partisan gerrymandering constitutionally illegal even if they think it's \"unsavory.\"  I think they may be willing to consider new evidence in the matter, consider it now before it becomes even harder and while it impacts so many states now considering cases where the new \"efficiency gap\" issue might sway them (so probably it will end up at SCOTUS anyway).   I'm not a legal expert so I can't begin to determine from precedent on cases or justices whether \"any part\" of the case will be considered unconstitutional, but it seems that it will still be extremely challenging to link partisan voting resentment to the 1st amendment (as it's never been linked to voting at all, that I am aware, though it has been linked to forming political parties and publishing/protesting on behalf of political parties, which is still very different from doing all things political parties can do but with as much political force applied by the opposing/ruling group as possible --> US judges are not required to make it easier for any political party to win any local or national election).  The argument from the 14th Amendment to classify \"Democrats\" as a group facing unequal access/treatment is probably the strongest hope, but even that seems, based on the above information, a very steep climb to success. useful / for later reference (if not especially deep in terms of analysis):\nhttp://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/censorship/courtcases\nhttps://constitutioncenter.org/blog/10-huge-supreme-court-cases-about-the-14th-amendment\nhttps://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/07/28/heres-why-the-14th-amendment-is-a-big-deal"], [30364, "2017-10-03T00:17:21Z", [0.26], ""], [32258, "2017-10-02T22:09:46Z", [0.5], "@lsgold I initially went high on this --85% and I realize now that deep down, I did that because I believed that Kennedy really doesn't like Trump for many of the reasons you stated. I also figured that's likely why he's not retiring yet. McCain and other Republicans have submitted amicus briefs along with lots of groups. I figured Kennedy wanted to be somewhat of a hero here as he gets close to retirement contemplating his legacy. But then, I didn't get the sense that he's quite done that ever before...so I went the other way down to 25%.  It's the narrowness of the Supreme Court's stated opinions that led me in the opposite direction. I also have to admit that while I appreciate all of your comments, I don't understand most of what you write...you are speedy, a bit cryptic.  So, my question to you as an attorney is this. What are the possible ways that Kennedy could affirm the lower court? Could he 1) affirm lower court but say not for the efficiency gap test or any other test that was discussed in that case? 2) affirm lower court and come up with another test? You say statistics alot but I don't get specifically what you are talking about with regard to Kennedy. 3) Pick any part (even a small part) of the Wisconsin plan and call it unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. If he concurs with the liberal justices but comes up with either a regular or special concurrence, what could that be and what are the implications for setting precedents going forward?  I get that judges are biased like everyone else, but they hide it behind all sorts of narrow language so as not to set sweeping new precedents (except in the rare occurrence when they set sweeping new precedents). ;-)  You can see why I am torn and confused as to where this is going.\nI'm moving to the middle till we learn something on Tuesday.

But extreme gerrymandering is a problem that by definition can\u2019t\nbe fixed through the normal political process, since the whole point is to\nmake it hard or impossible for certain voters to make their voices heard.\nThat\u2019s not government of the people; it\u2019s government in spite of the people.\nThe better, although not perfect, solution is to take map drawing away from\nself-interested politicians and put it in the hands of an independent or\nbipartisan commission, as more than a dozen states have done, helping to\nmake races both more competitive and less partisan.\nUntil that happens everywhere, the court must step in and stop the most\negregious gerrymanders.

And three of the current justices \u2013 Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Neil Gorsuch \u2013 had not yet joined the court when it decided LULAC in 2006. We may be able to discern at least a hint of those three justices\u2019 views on this case from an order that the court issued the same day that it announced that it would review the case: The justices granted the state\u2019s request to block an order by the lower court that would have required the state legislature to create a new redistricting plan by the fall. The state had argued that it should not have to spend time and money creating a new map until the Supreme Court can rule on the validity of the old plan; at a minimum, the state claimed, the court\u2019s eventual opinion will provide \u201csignificant guidance\u201d for the state to use in drafting a new redistricting plan. Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan indicated that they would have denied the state\u2019s request, but the state\u2019s ability to muster the five votes that it needed to put the lower court\u2019s order on hold could bode poorly for the challengers, because one factor that the justices had to consider in making their decision was whether the state is likely to succeed on the merits of its claim. On the other hand, the case appears to have been scheduled for oral argument earlier than it might normally have been: Although the justices did not announce until June 19 that they would review Gill v. Whitford, it leapfrogged over several other cases (including two granted in February, two granted in March and one granted in April) to take a spot on the October argument calendar. That could suggest that the justices intend to try to decide the case quickly, which would in turn allow new maps to be drawn sooner even if the district court\u2019s order is not in effect. We will likely know more after the justices hear oral argument in early October.\" tautological reasoning\nwant great reasoning\ncheck out the non experts\nand the crowd neglects the most important factor\nTHE HISTORICAL CONTEXT AND THE FUKUYAMA THEOREM ( not end of history)\nRule of Law in 3 words \nWisconsin went for Trump\nCyber attacks on  John Podesta and DNCC and DCCC\nby Russians\nhacked and disseminated\nby a fool tool in the Ecuadoran embassy\nthen you have bots on Twitter and facebook\nand paid ads\nLove to cross  x Big Bro  Zuckeberg on that and his 2 billion fools\nand here is an active espionage investigation\ntargets close to Trump \nNatl Sec.

Political Geographers\u2019 Amicus On Distinguishing Partisan Gerrymandering From Natural Geographic Clustering\nPosted on September 13, 2017 2:16 pm by Richard Pildes I want to single out, in two posts, two amicus briefs in Whitford.  I am co-counsel on the first, filed on behalf of a group of academic experts in political geography (see here). I chose to represent these experts because I considered it particularly important that the Court be aware of the social-scientific techniques that now exist, and that are being further developed, that enable courts to determine objectively whether the partisan advantages in a districting plan are the result of intentional partisan gerrymandering or of \u201cneutral factors,\u201d such as the greater natural geographic clustering of one party\u2019s voters (typically, Democrats in cities). Many of the other briefs in the case, from both the challengers and the State, as well as from other amici, refer to the work described in this brief, which is being done by academics such as Jonathan Rodden, Jowei Chen, Wesley Pegden, Wendy Tam, and others.   This brief provides a full explanation of these techniques, which are now available and can help provide a judicially manageable standard for adjudicating partisan gerrymandering claims. In determining whether partisan gerrymandering has occurred and to what extent, other social scientists have developed means of analyzing whether districting plans treat the two major parties in symmetric fashion:  if Democrats win 55% of the vote but gain 65% of the seats, that is not necessarily a problem of partisan gerrymandering if Republicans would also gain 65% of the seats if they won 55% of the vote.  But while being able to determine whether a plan treats voters of each party the same or \u201casymmetrically\u201d is an important first step, it is still just that.  For it remains possible that this difference in how the two parties fare might be the result, as noted above for example, of the natural geographic clustering of one party\u2019s voters.   Indeed, the Appellants and the Wisconsin legislature both defend Wisconsin\u2019s plan party on this basis. The techniques described in this brief enable the next step of analysis:  distinguishing between plans that favor one party, but for legitimate or neutral reasons, and those that can best be explained as doing so only as a result of intentional partisan gerrymandering.  At the time of the Court\u2019s last major confrontation with the issue of partisan gerrymandering in the Vieth case (2004), Justice Kennedy withheld judgment but recognized that \u201cnew technologies may \u201cproduce new methods of analysis that make more evident the precise nature of the burdens gerrymanders impose,\u201d which would \u201cfacilitate court efforts to identify and remedy th[ose] burdens.\u201d  This brief describes precisely these important new methods of analysis that have emerged since Vieth. The political geographers\u2019 amicus brief describes three related techniques.  I won\u2019t try to re-create all of that discussion here.  But the first technique, which has become the most widely known and has been judicially endorsed, by the Fourth Circuit in this opinion, takes advantage of modern computing power to create vast numbers of simulated districting plans based on traditional districting criteria, which can then be compared to the enacted plan.  As the Fourth Circuit put it, the logic of this technique is that \u201cif a computer randomly draws five hundred redistricting plans following traditional redistricting criteria, and the actual enacted plans fall completely outside the range of what the computer has drawn, one can conclude that the traditional criteria do not explain that enacted plan.\u201d In the Wisconsin case, each of these three analytical methods for measuring the effect of political geography support the conclusion that the Wisconsin plan is an extreme, intentional partisan gerrymander.  That is particularly noteworthy, because two of the signatories to the brief \u2014 Professors Rodden and Chen \u2014 had concluded in an important article applying the simulated-plans technique that part of the Republican advantage in the House was best explained not by partisan gerrymandering, but by the greater natural geographic clustering of Democratic voters.

I've also looked into Justice Kennedy's comments and opinions related to standards that led up to the District Court's decision in Whitford. In summary, it seems to me that Kennedy should be able to uphold the District Court's decision without explicitly making the \"efficiency gap\" theory the standard of all standards that while it has much merit but could also be viewed as a one size fits all standard. The Supreme Court could decide (5-4) that the Wisconsin case simply goes too far making \"partisanship\" their predominant intention in redistricting without making the \"efficiency gap\" standard the ultimate test.

S 237 (U.S. Apr. 28, 2004)\nthe plurality suggests there is no place for the First Amendment in this area. See ante, at ____, 158 L. Ed. 2d, at 568. The implication  [*315]  is that under the First Amendment any and all consideration of political interests in an apportionment would be invalid. Ibid.  [****94] (\"Only an equal protection claim is before us in the present case--perhaps for the very good reason that a First Amendment claim, if it were sustained, would render unlawful all consideration of political affiliation in districting\"). That misrepresents the First Amendment analysis. The inquiry is not whether political classifications were used. The inquiry instead is whether political classifications were used to burden a group's representational rights. If a court were to find that a State did impose burdens and restrictions on groups or persons by reason of their views, there would likely be a First Amendment violation, unless the State shows some compelling interest. Of course, all this depends first on courts' having available a manageable standard by which to measure the effect of the apportionment and so to conclude that  [**1798]  the State did impose a burden or restriction on the rights of a party's voters. Where it is alleged that a gerrymander had the purpose and effect of imposing burdens on a disfavored party and its voters, the First Amendment may offer a sounder and more prudential basis for intervention than does the Equal Protection Clause. The equal protection analysis  [****95] puts its emphasis on the permissibility of an enactment's classifications.  [***582]  This works where race is involved since classifying by race is almost never permissible. It presents a more complicated question when the inquiry is whether a generally permissible classification has been used for an impermissible purpose. That question can only be answered in the affirmative by the subsidiary showing that the classification as applied imposes unlawful burdens. The First Amendment analysis concentrates on whether the legislation burdens the representational rights of the complaining party's voters for reasons of ideology, beliefs, or political association. The analysis allows a pragmatic or functional assessment that accords some latitude to the States. See Eu v. San Francisco  [*316]  County Democratic Central Comm., 489 U.S. 214, 103 L. Ed. 2d 271, 109 S. Ct. 1013 (1989); Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, 75 L. Ed. 2d 547, 103 S. Ct. 1564 (1983). Finally, I do not understand the plurality to conclude that partisan gerrymandering that disfavors one party is permissible. Indeed, the Court seems to acknowledge it is not. See ante, at ____, 158 L. Ed. 2d, at 567 (\"We do  [****96] not disagree with [the] judgment\" that \"partisan gerrymanders [are incompatible] with democratic principles\"); ante, at ____, 158 L. Ed.2d, at 567 (noting that it is the case, and that the plurality opinion assumes it to be the case, that \"an excessive injection of politics [in districting] is unlawful\"). This is all the more reason to admit the possibility of later suits, while holding just that the parties have failed to prove, under our \"well developed and familiar\" standard, that these legislative classifications \"reflec[t] no policy, but simply arbitrary and capricious action.\" Baker, 369 U.S., at 226, 82 S. Ct. 691, 7 L. Ed. 2d 663. That said, courts must be cautious about adopting a standard that turns on whether the partisan interests in the redistricting process were excessive. Excessiveness is not easily determined. Consider these apportionment schemes: In one State, Party X controls the apportionment process and draws the lines so it captures every congressional seat. In three other States, Party Y controls the apportionment process. It is not so blatant or egregious, but proceeds by a more subtle effort, capturing less than all the seats in each State. Still, the  [****97] total effect of Party Y's effort is to capture more new seats than Party X captured. Party X's gerrymander was more egregious. Party Y's gerrymander was more subtle. In my view, however, each is culpable. * * * The ordered working of our Republic, and of the democratic process, depends on a sense of decorum and restraint in all branches of government, and in the citizenry itself. Here, one has the sense that legislative restraint was abandoned. That should not be thought to serve the interests of our political order. Nor should it be thought to serve  [*317]  our interest in demonstrating to the world how democracy works. Whether spoken with concern or pride, it is unfortunate that our legislators have reached the point of declaring that, when it comes to apportionment, \"'We are in the business of rigging elections.'\" J. Hoeffel, Six Incumbents Are a Week Away from Easy Election, Winston-Salem Journal, Jan. 27, 1998, p. B1 (quoting a North Carolina state senator). Still, the Court's own responsibilities  [***583]  require that we refrain from intervention in  [**1799]  this instance. The failings of the many proposed standards for measuring the burden a gerrymander imposes on representational rights make our  [****98] intervention improper. If workable standards do emerge to measure these burdens, however, courts should be prepared to order relief.
