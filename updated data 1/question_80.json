Thanks to @clinton for the last one. It seems like everyone is now saying that there will be a deal with the EU by Friday or nothing. (Note that in my last prediction I thought the negotiations could and probably would move into March. That appears unlikely now.) Current polls point to a potential narrow victory for staying in the EU right now, though a lot of big voices on the conservative side seem to be lining up against it. The consensus also seems to be that a later vote would have a better chance of shifting towards Brexit (which makes me wonder about June, since that's really not that close.) So here's what I think: 1. If Cameron gets a deal on Friday, i say there's a 90% chance that he calls a June vote. He's fought too hard to get the deal; delaying a vote on it would be interpreted as him being unsatisfied with it, and then he's screwed. The 10% represents the possibility that he gets a deal that is so bad that it's widely scorned, and the polls swing immediately towards Brexit. In that case he might find some kind of way to weasel out of a June vote.  2. Conversely, if Cameron doesn't get a deal, the vote probably gets delayed. There will be enough conservative chest-thumping to shift the polls, and Cameron will be seen as weak. It will be pretty much back to the drawing board for the pro-EU side, and they'll need a delay. The fall-back position for Cameron and the EU is to say they'll try to work it out in March, but at this point I think even that much delay would push the vote back far enough for a no on this question. If there is no deal, I predict a 90% chance that the vote will be delayed long enough that it's not set by May 1. 3. So what are the odds of Cameron getting a deal?

Is it already stitched-up? Are both UK citizens and Frankfurt being played at the same time?"], [11885, "2016-02-14T17:49:18Z", [0.99], ""], [14531, "2016-02-14T17:05:13Z", [0.71], "Let's start with the outside view. The first fact to note is that PM David Cameron has promised to hold a referendum on the UK's membership in the EU (a.k.a. Brexit[1]) before the end of 2017. (Both the Economist[2] and the BBC[3] have impeccable overviews.) How likely is it that Cameron will follow through on his promise? Pretty likely, I think. I'd be willing to make about a 100-to-1 bet in favor but not much lower, so let's say there's a 99% chance that there referendum will be held by the end of 2017. For the moment, I'm going to ignore this possibility, but I'll factor it back into the mix later. And I think it's safe to assume that the date for the vote would have to be announced no later than the end of September 2017. It's now (roughly) half of the way through February, so in order for Britain to set a date for the Brexit vote before the end of 2017, it has to do so in the remaining 19.5 months. Assuming that the date on which the Brexit vote is set is randomly determined, the probability of that Britain will set a date prior to May 1, 2016 is 1.0-(17/19.5) = 0.128. Why? Per the above, I'm assuming that our probability space is made up of the following discrete outcomes: Britain announces the vote in February 2016 = Pr(0.5/19.5)\nBritain announces the vote in March 2016 = Pr(1.0/19.5)\nBritain announces the vote in April 2016 = Pr(1.0/19.5)\nBritain announces the vote in May 2016 = Pr(1.0/19.5)\nEtc...\nBritain announces the vote in September 2017 = Pr(1.0/19.5) So 1 (i.e., the entire probability space) = (0.5/19.5)+(1.0/19.5)+...(1.0/19.5) (i.e., the probability that the announcement will be made in any given month). Another way to put the matter (which will be useful below) is in the following way: Britain announces the vote in 2016 = Pr(10.5/19.5)\nBritain announces the vote in 2017 = Pr(9.0/19.5)\nFrom here, it's just a matter of separating the probability that the announcement will be made in (the remainder of February), March, or April of 2016 (=2.5/19.5 = 12.8%).  But let's complicate matters a bit. Cameron has said a number of things that suggest he strongly favors having the vote in 2016. For example, he recently said, \"I believe that 2016 will be the year we achieve something really vital, fundamentally changing the UK's relationship with the EU and finally addressing the concerns of the British people about our membership.\"[4] Some other political leaders in Britain have also expressed a preference for having (or at least a willingness to have) the vote in 2016[5]. That suggests that strongly weighting the probability that the date will be set in 2016. I'll incorporate this fact in my model (rather crudely) as a 3-to-1 bet that the vote will be announced in 2016 as follows: Britain announces the vote in 2016 = Pr(15.5/19.5)\nBritain announces the vote in 2017 = Pr(4.0/19.5) Hence, the probability of that the Brexit vote will be announced in a randomly determined month in 2016 = (15.5/19.5)/12 = 7.0%. The exceptions are January (probability = 0 since all of that month is in the past) and February (probability = 3.5% since half of that month is in the past). On these assumptions, it follows that the probability that the vote will be announced before May 1, 2016 is 7% + 7% + 3.5% = 17.5%. This number should decrease by 17.5/75 (= about .233) every day as we approach May 1, so that it will be (17.5 - (3.26))% on March 1, and so on. Finally, let's return to the the very small possibility that Cameron will back out on his promise to hold the Brexit vote. I rated that as about a 100-to-1 shot. So today the outside view should be that there will be a 17.325% (17.5 x 0.99) chance that the Brexit vote will be announced before May 1. And it means that on March 1, there will be a 14.098% ((17.5 - (3.26)) x 0.99) chance that the Brexit vote will be announced before May 1. So much for the outside view, but what about the inside view? Cameron has signaled that he'd like the referendum to be held on June 23[6]. However, ongoing negotiations with Brussel looks to make it impossible for him to announce this date until after the European Council summit on 18/19 February, or perhaps as late as 22/23 February. Moreover, some think that Cameron has good reason to want the Brexit vote sooner rather than later. \"Mr Cameron\u2019s chances of victory improve the sooner he holds it. He does not want another terror attack or more refugee chaos to turn the referendum into a vote on immigration.\"[7]\nOthers mutter that British public opinion has already turned against EU membership[8 and 9 and 10] and that Cameron's best hope for keeping the UK in the the EU is to stall[11]. And there's a lot of uncertainty in the currency market about how a Bexit vote would go down[12]. (Ideal speculation: It seems to me - I lived in the UK for 4 years during the 2000s but am no expert about its politics - that nativism among Tory voters has gotten out of the control of conservative leadership in the UK in much the same way that nativism among Republican voters has gotten out of the control of conservative leadership in the U.S.A. Brexit in the U.K., and Trumpism is the U.S.A. But, to repeat, this is just ideal speculation.) At any rate, the inside view is harder to estimate because of the qualitative (rather than quantitative) nature of the data. But I think about an 88% probability of announcing the Brexit vote before May 1 is right. Where are we then? Outside View: 17.325%\nInside View: 88.0% So do we go with the outside view or the inside view? The obvious response is the we don't have to chose between the two; we can synthesize the view points. Yet that's damn hard, given the lack of isomorphism between the kinds of data I've got in front of me (and the squirrely way I came up with the inside estimate. A unweighted average of the two numbers is 52.66%. But at the moment, I have a lot more confidence in the inside view, that confidence might change a lot after Cameron's negotiations with the EU conclude, so I'll need to keep an eye on that. But until then I favor a weighted average of the inside and outside views, placing 3 times as much weight on the inside view. That means I'm forecasting 70.33% (rounding up to 71%) probability that Britain will set a date for a referendum on EU membership before May 1. However, I'll need to rethink this as soon as the EU negotiations are concluded. https://pythagorassite.wordpress.com/2016/02/14/before-1-may-2016-will-britain-set-a-date-for-a-referendum-on-eu-membership/ -- [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum [2] http://www.economist.com/news/britain/21690053-renegotiation-britains-eu-membership-mainly-theatre-it-may-be-enough-david [3] http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887 [4] http://www.euractiv.com/sections/uk-europe/cameron-drops-big-2016-hint-brexit-referendum-date-320599 [5] http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/26/british-eu-referendum-when-what-who-answers-to-key-questions-brexit [6] http://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/640853/When-is-the-EU-referendum-June-23-Brexit-David-Cameron [7] http://www.economist.com/news/britain/21690053-renegotiation-britains-eu-membership-mainly-theatre-it-may-be-enough-david [8] http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3440970/EU-President-Donald-Tusk-says-talks-David-Cameron-s-EU-deal-fragile.html#ixzz3znHsHXqN [9] http://www.theweek.co.uk/eu-referendum/65461/eu-referendum-poll-support-for-brexit-highest-in-two-years [10] http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/eu-referendum-cabinet-minister-set-to-push-for-brexit-within-minutes-of-cameron-europe-deal-a6871406.html [11] http://www.ft.com/fastft/2016/02/03/cameron-pressured-to-hold-brexit-vote-later-than-june/ [12] http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-15/u-k-markets-pounded-and-brexit-vote-doesn-t-even-have-a-date\n"], [5578, "2016-02-14T16:08:39Z", [0.8], "It needs to be done.

In fact, most conservative MPs favor Brexit (see http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/10/influential-backbencher-delivers-blow-to-david-cameron-by-backing-brexit), as do many voters. (~45% to 36% according to the first article) Cameron has two upcoming EU meetings (next week and Mid-March) to get a deal nailed down. I don't expect that this will happen at the summit next week. It might happen in March, but the sides seem pretty far apart.  Also, it seems that the financial Masters of the Universe have started to put some shots across Cameron's bow (http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-10/hsbc-board-said-to-meet-sunday-to-mull-headquarters-decision), lest anyone forget that there's a $hitload of money at stake. Cameron has pledged a vote by the end of 2017. That's a long way off, and he probably has the room to push that somewhat. I think the only way he sets a date for a vote is if there is (1) a deal in place to vote on that he EU has agreed to, or (2) a complete breakdown of EU negotiations.  I don't see #2 as likely, since this is the EU and they can negotiate on anything even remotely technical until the end of time. (See my predictions on the TTIP: in a word, nope). I say 5%. As far as a getting a deal goes, I think there may be eventually be one, but this is really going to rub a lot of EU members the wrong way, particularly in light of how many of them have been taking in large numbers of refugees lately. To be blunt, the only reason that the UK can even plausibly argue for such stringent anti-immigration provisions is because they're an island nation. I don't think that will sit well with the average German who just watched Merkel pledge to take in 1 million refugees. Any deal that is stringent enough to to satisfy UK conservatives is likely to require a lot of political feather smoothing in the other EU countries. That takes time, so I'm betting that the chance of a deal being agreed to in time to allow for a date to be set by May 1 is about 25%.

The Electoral Commission have stated this process could take six weeks.

Key point here (bearing in mind the narrow Tory majority in the Commons:  \"Usually, Parliamentary business managers allow six weeks for such instruments. But there will be only a four week gap after the February European Council and the date on which a shortened designation process must begin in time for a June 23rd poll. Yet the Scottish Nationalists, and the Democratic Unionists have said they will vote against a June date on the not unreasonable grounds it will overshadow their elections.\"  None the less, that article assesses that 23rd June is still the most likely date for a referendum (and PM Cameron, who is pro-EU may be considered to favour the poll being held sooner rather than later, as numerous issues that show the EU in a poor light - perhaps above all the migration crisis - might well tip the balance of opinion in the direction of Brexit). But, still, that means time is short, and something that Cameron is prepared to present to his public needs to be agreed by February - not any later. Does the will exist in Brussels to present Cameron with something that goes someway towards assuaging concerns in his party and the British populace more generally about EU centralisation? It is as yet uncertain.

July and August are not seen as good months to hold a nationwide poll, as many voters will be on their summer holidays. However, the question is not whether a referendum will be held before May 1st but if a date will be set. It is now contingent on Feb/March: \"If he gets a deal in March, he could hold a vote in September. If he has to wait until the European Council meeting on 23-24 June to get a deal, the earliest Mr Cameron could realistically hold a referendum is October, with a short campaign period.

Then he has to come back and present it to the House of Commons and country as an honourable agreement . . . .This is the beginning of the problems. To go sooner than later, Cameron has to lean on the Electoral Commission, whose advice is to have a six-month campaign period in a referendum. That timescale is impossible if Cameron chooses  to go before the end of June. \"Then there is the issue of the Enabling Bill to allow the referendum that is sitting waiting to be launched, with a provisional date in the parliamentary calendar post-EU summit. This would take, in the best-case scenario, 10 days to railroad through Parliament but the Tories are not the full masters of this.  They have a Commons majority of 12 and, if Labour choose to oppose a rush, along with the SNP, the Government would be defeated by Euro-sceptic Tories.

The European council discusses Cameron's demands in mid-Feb so that's another point at which he could emerge and say \"I've got a good deal, here's the date.\" But I think the risk is that by setting it before the local elections on 5 May, it's likely to lead to Tory divisions dominating more of the headlines in the run-up. The other parties can make a decent bit of hay from that. The Budget in March is another consideration. Some disappointing growth figures could shine the spotlight back on the government (though with Labour's current inability to capitalise on Tory errors, that's doubtful).

I suggest this is due to the latter picking up a lot of noisy nationalists. Cameron will know this & is unlikely to be intimidated by apparently unfavourable online polls.

The main thing likely to make it happen sooner is good progress on UK renegotiations. These second round ones last weekend seem to have gone well: Cameron (BI.com), Jan 21st: \"People said we wouldn't keep our promise but we've kept our promise and we are giving a referendum. The people will see that we have a proper negotiation going and already we've made very good progress. As my children would say in the car, 'are we there yet?' \u2014 no we're not.

First, the negotiation with the EU (and Member States) after which one of the above pathways 'kick-in':  \n > this is scheduled to reach 'mutually satisfactory solutions' in the European Council on 18-19 February [2]. The next European Council meeting is 17-18 March and then 23-24 June [4]\nDURATION: 1 to 5 months, based on assumtion the negotiation has to finish before summer 2016, so June Council meeting, to meet the referendum deadline before 2017. PLAN A: TREATY CHANGE\n3.  Signing a 'legally-binding and permenant' deal [3,5]:  \n> there are two ways to change the treaties: (1) 'ordinary revision procedure' this means that the European Council may decide by a simple majority, after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament [6] after which the amendments enter into force after being ratified by all the Member States. And (2) the 'simplified revision procedure' which requires a unanimous decision by the European Council and again ratification by Member States or in a second option of the simplified revision 'that no objection is made within 6 months'. In both cases a consultation rounds lengthening the proces. To me it is unclear which route will be followed, please Reply if someone knows. DURATION:\nOUTSIDE-IN: there have been 4 Treaty chances involving the above procedures of which only 2 where ratified: establishing the European Stabilisation Mechanism and increasing the members of the European Parliament. The first took 4 months, the second 14 months: averaging 9 months. INSIDE-OUT: a crucial and slightly overlooked item is that the European Parliament has to consulted and give consent AND that national governments have to agree/ratify. The key point is that the national governments of Hungary, Slovakia and especcialy Poland have aired to require substansive quid-pro-quo if Britain wants to restrict migrant benefits (mainly afecting Poles and Hungarians) -for example a stronger NATO presence. This last item could only be agreed on 8-9 July during next NATO meeting. My next update I'll look into the Parliament stance. \n- the official June 2016 date was mentioned in summer 2015, but this was before the missed deadline to finish negotiations in December. TREATY CHANGE DURATION: 5 months minimum to 20 months maximum, taking the mean as 9 months. PLAN B: PROTOCOL  [7]\n- There is a likelihood that Britain will settle for a protocol or some other binding declaration that will be formally ratified only if and when a future treaty is in the works which could be resemble concessions offered to Denmark and Ireland in the past and ratified only later. If this protocol would be reliable enough, the referendum could still be held.  PROTOCOL DURATION: \n- OUTSIDE IN: 12 months for the Irish Lisbon treaty opt-outs and 11 for the Danish decision. Average: 7 months when substracting 3 months to hold the Irish and Danish referenda. \n- observation: the 4 months was only achieved in the teeth at the height of the financial crises.\n- this will require Cameron breaking the pledge to obtain the legally-binding and permenent agreement. PLAN C: INTERGOVERNMENTAL TREATY\n- this involves all Member States to sign a treaty which was used 4 times, one in 2005 and the other three more recent being the 'Fiscal Compact', 'Stability Mechanism', and 'Single Resolution Fund Agreement'. The first two took 4 months, the last 9 months  [8]. Average: 5,5 months.\n-Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Germany\u2019s finance minister. He suggested a so-called \u201cintergovernmental treaty,\u201d 4.  Finally, announcing the referendum\nDURATION: 1 to 4 weeks, some preparations and scheduling has to be done (assuming most preparation have allready been made). TOTAL DURATION:\n- averaging TREATY CHANGE, PROTOCOL and INTERGOVERNMENTAL TREATY gives 7,2 months (standard deviation 2 months). Time to 1th of May is 3,75 months. \n- Chance given by probability calculation (baysian): 4%. FORECAST: 7%    (slight upward adjustment taking the current 42% Good Judgement consensus into account)\n___________________________ Note: question definition is fuzzy: 'setting' a date is one which has obtained Royal assent could take slightly longer.

Thus, he is trying to get the changes to the EU that he thinks will make membership more appealing to Brits, since it appears likely that a British referendum on EU membership will fail if there aren't reforms/changes in the relationship between the EU and Britain where some powers are returned to Britain.  Cameron is going to press for these reforms/changes at the next EU meeting Feb 18/19 and, if necessary, at the leaders' summit in mid-March.   A key demand Cameron is proposing is to restrict non-British EU citizens from accessing certain benefits during their first four years in the country; this proposal has not been well-received by some EU members.       An European Council declaration or Protocol, legally binding on all Member States (and inserted into the Treaty in due course), is likely to be the best that Cameron will be able to achieve in February or March.  If he gets it, I think he'll announce a referendum date shortly thereafter, otherwise, he'll delay setting a date.

So, the Brexit will start a shockwave that would impact Greece, Spain, and most probably will cause  internal problems in Germany as Ms Merkel will lose valuable allies for the re- distribution of immigrants in Europe. \n"], [14444, "2016-01-02T14:29:26Z", [0.75], ""], [691, "2016-01-02T14:22:44Z", [0.64], ""], [14441, "2016-01-02T12:21:22Z", [0.2], ""], [14434, "2016-01-02T10:23:05Z", [0.3], ""], [10898, "2016-01-02T10:20:39Z", [0.75], ""], [11080, "2016-01-02T09:52:44Z", [0.75], ""], [11080, "2016-01-02T09:52:17Z", [0.74], ""], [14432, "2016-01-02T08:28:45Z", [0.15], "Likely to delay as long as possible"], [73, "2016-01-02T06:35:43Z", [0.95], "+1 http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jan/01/stuart-rose-on-the-eu-referendum-the-sooner-we-get-it-done-the-better"], [4273, "2016-01-02T04:35:19Z", [0.68], ""], [498, "2016-01-02T02:28:35Z", [0.35], ""], [43, "2016-01-02T00:50:14Z", [0.85], ""], [73, "2016-01-01T23:51:57Z", [0.94], ""], [73, "2016-01-01T23:51:40Z", [0.93], ""], [73, "2016-01-01T23:50:16Z", [0.92], ""], [24, "2016-01-01T23:47:45Z", [0.35], ""], [73, "2016-01-01T23:03:57Z", [0.96], ""], [38, "2016-01-01T23:01:03Z", [0.88], "http://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/629313/Britain-EU-referendum-European-Council-presidency-2017-Brexit-vote-David-Cameron \"It is believed the Prime Minister's preferred date for a referendum is June 16 . . . \"\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  My post of Dec 20, 2015 11:30PM makes the same statement and suggests that it would be announced about 4 months in advance--i.e. mid-February, after the EU summit."], [14201, "2016-01-01T22:13:21Z", [0.41], ""], [368, "2016-01-01T22:06:16Z", [0.9], ""], [14411, "2016-01-01T21:25:03Z", [0.49], "hard to tell"], [5001, "2016-01-01T20:58:53Z", [0.7], "With bookies offering "], [13377, "2016-01-01T18:19:27Z", [0.66], ""], [4042, "2016-01-01T18:11:48Z", [0.65], ""], [14402, "2016-01-01T17:54:05Z", [0.18], "Cameron is near securing concessions.

Yes: The Conservatives have pledged to their party that they would hold a referendum and there is little reason to expect them to go back on that pledge. Governments at least try to do what they say they are going to do. Elections are in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, and London. The conservatives lost votes in Scotland to the Scottish Nationalist party. Cameron may want to bring some of these votes back. But there was high turnout that may not come back.

No: Politicians like to be vague and ambiguous. Overall I think they would prefer to not mobilize opposition votes by setting a date. The extra votes the mobilize by setting a date may be offset by those that believe Cameron actually does want to leave the EU.

Thursdays are the traditional voting day in the United Kingdom, and a date as early as June 9 is feasible, though the planned timetable makes June 16, the 16th Thursday after the end of the February summit, more likely. \u201cSixteen weeks, roughly four months, plus or minus a bit, is what I think of as the period between announcing a firm date and the referendum taking place,\u201d Europe Minister David Lidington told the House of Lords European Union Committee on Monday. \u201cWe will need to have secondary legislation with an affirmative resolution in each house to specify a date. My working assumption is that takes about six weeks. Only when that is complete can we start the clock ticking on the 10-week minimum campaign period required by law.\u201d \"Polling on voting intention in the run-up to the referendum has been inconclusive. While two telephone polls published Wednesday showed double-digit leads in favour of staying in, online polling has largely shown the two sides neck-and-neck.\n\u201cThe \u2018Leave\u2019 camp should be holding a far more compelling lead than they\u2019re doing.\u201d Goodwin said. \u201cI\u2019ve not seen any convincing evidence suggesting \u2018Leave\u2019 has got a lead beyond the margin of error.\u201d \"Cameron has pledged to overhaul Britain\u2019s membership of the bloc before an in-out referendum before the end of 2017.\nHe said there\u2019s now \u201cmomentum\u201d for a deal after the summit talks. \"The main sticking point remains Cameron\u2019s determination to make citizens of other EU countries ineligible for in-work, housing and child-welfare payments until they have been in Britain for four years.Leaders indicated they might accept a compromise similar to opt-outs from certain EU rules that Denmark won in 1992, an EU official said on condition of anonymity. \"This could be enshrined in law before the UK holds its referendum and could include a so-called emergency brake to enable Britain to restrict welfare payments if it could prove exceptional circumstances, the official said.\non the way \u201cIf we can get these reforms right, and I believe that we can, I firmly believe that for our economic security and increasingly for our national security, the best future for Britain is in a reformed European Union,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cWe are well on the way to a deal, we\u2019ve taken good steps forward, now we\u2019ve got to bring it home.\u201d \"The divisions in UKIP, the only party committed to an exit from the EU, were exposed again yesterday as Douglas Carswell, the party's only House of Commons lawmaker, called for Nigel Farage to be replaced as leader.\n"], [11872, "2015-12-21T05:40:23Z", [0.4], ""], [73, "2015-12-21T04:49:56Z", [0.92], ""], [102, "2015-12-21T04:23:58Z", [0.51], ""], [43, "2015-12-21T04:15:41Z", [0.95], "Following @dkc, who has been remarkably consistently good in her forecasting."], [306, "2015-12-21T03:10:45Z", [0.69], ""], [306, "2015-12-21T03:09:47Z", [0.5], ""], [4273, "2015-12-21T01:03:38Z", [0.58], ""], [5365, "2015-12-20T23:08:33Z", [0.8], "Cameron can't lose face.

The Danish referendum last week simply adds fuel to the fire of the seriousness of the need for EU reform. \"The British PM needs to find an appropriate time when he can leverage UK interests with the French presidential elections (March/April 2017) and the German federal elections (September 2017) \u2013 especially as we don\u2019t know whether Angela Merkel will run for a fourth term. \"Cameron may be hoping that the Scottish elections in May 2016 act as a Brexit domestic distraction. Furthermore, if the Scottish referendum has set a precedent, then an \u2018enabling act\u2019 will take about nine months, which in itself will take us into 2017. In this case, the most ideal moment may be just before the German federal elections in the autumn of 2017. \"According to the Independent, Cameron is now confident that European leaders are embracing the need for change and want Britain to continue playing a leading role in the EU. There seems to be more momentum than ever behind Britain\u2019s campaign for EU reform. If this is true, then there is credibility in Britain aligning an EU referendum with the German and French. \"Meanwhile, Cameron might use his clear majority to insist on setting the rules for the referendum. For example, the voting rights may be similar to a general election: British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens, as well as British expats who have lived abroad for less than 15 years, will be able to vote, while EU citizens based in Britain will not. \". . . The most recent pro-EU high of 61 percent in 2000 (with only 27 percent favouring an exit) has fallen to 45 percent in favour and 38 percent against, according to an ICM poll in October, while two recent YouGov polls suggest the Brexit vote is slightly ahead. This could possibly be explained by the refugee crisis.  Without a real reform commitment agenda, Cameron may be faced with a greater challenge than the 2014 Scottish referendum. It may well be that Britain\u2019s real dilemma is: reform or the voters will exit.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  I have not given this question the attention it deserves or requires, and now I am trying to catch up.

The House of Lords voted last month to include 16 and 17-year-olds \u2013 but MPs rejected the move last week by a majority of 50. Tonight a fresh move by Labour to give registered 16 and 17-year-olds a vote was rejected by 263 votes to 246.\n[...]\n\"The vote in the House of Lords today means that the Bill to deliver the referendum will now pass into law before Christmas. \"The referendum will be held before the end of 2017 and rightly be based on the Westminster franchise.\"\n[...]\nThe vote prevents a fresh constitutional clash between elected MPs and unelected peers and a further bout of \"parliamentary ping-pong\" over the European Union Referendum Bill. The Government has said it would cost \u00a36 million to lower the voting age and \"financial privilege\" was invoked to help overturn the change to the bill in the Commons.

The next big thing to watch for will be the UK-EU meeting later this week. That is, the only likely \"big\" news out of this meeting would be that there's a bigger valley between the two sides (EU and the UK) than previously thought, throwing into question the possibility of an agreement at the February meeting.

News of this new attempt to reshape the United Kingdom's Referendum Act, the bill setting out the details of the vote on EU membership, comes days after the House of Commons voted down the Lords' previous attempt to amend the act and allow younger voters. Repeated confrontations between the two houses of Parliament create problems not just for the EU referendum but also for the United Kingdom's overall parliamentary process.\"\n~~~ And one other excerpt:\n\"If the confrontation between the two houses of Parliament continues in this fashion, it could delay the referendum. The process has already been delayed elsewhere \u2014 Cameron's renegotiation with the European Union has been pushed back from December 2015 to February 2016 because EU leaders have too many other issues on their plates at the moment. The earliest possible referendum date has long been considered to be in mid-2016, but that is liable to be pushed back if there are any more delays with the Referendum Act in Parliament or with Cameron's renegotiation with Brussels.\"\n~~~ COMMENT: Looks like the HoL aren't going to be \"put in their place\" by the Commons."], [691, "2015-12-11T19:25:35Z", [0.57], ""], [740, "2015-12-11T19:03:23Z", [0.59], ""], [12699, "2015-12-11T18:19:15Z", [0.2], "This is an initial forecast founded in little research on the topic but here is the background.

The other date I've seen written is September (which would need an announcement by the beginning of May, if it were to be Sept 1). If there's a snag in the deal between the EU and the UK, it could push the announcement back further and further. As it stands now, we know it almost certainly won't be announced before February. That leaves \"three\" months of wondering (all of February, March, and April) and we can probably exclude February from then because I doubt that they'd be able to announce the referendum after only just having come to terms with the EU, so we're probably looking at sometime in March or April (for an announcement) and that's just if it's going to happen before our deadline.

There had been suggestions that it could be held in May 2016, to coincide with elections in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London, rather than waiting for 2017 - but the government has ruled that out. http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-33141819 (June 25, 2015)\nEU referendum timeline: What will happen when? http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/eureferendum/12024043/David-Cameron-upbeat-over-chances-of-early-EU-renegotiation-discussion.html (Nov 29, 2015)\nBritain's renegotiation will be discussed at a crunch summit in just over a fortnight's time, the government revealed last night, dismissing mounting speculation that the timetable had slipped.\nNo 10 said that there will be a \"substantive\" discussion at the December European Council of Britain's new settlement in Europe \"as planned\".\n...\nOne diplomat, from a country opposed to the plan to deny EU workers benefits for four years, told the Telegraph Mr Cameron would need a \"miracle\" to get a hearing in December and said February was the more likely date for the major neogitiation.\nThe confident assertion hints that a breakthrough is close at hand.\nThat opens the door to a referendum early next year. http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32695399 (Nov 10, 2015)\nHis four key objectives are:\nEconomic governance: Securing an explicit recognition that the euro is not the only currency of the European Union, to ensure countries outside the eurozone are not materially disadvantaged. The UK wants safeguards that steps to further financial union cannot be imposed on non-eurozone members and the UK will not have to contribute to eurozone bailouts\nCompetitiveness: Setting a target for the reduction of the \"burden\" of excessive regulation and extending the single market\nImmigration: Restricting access to in-work and out-of-work benefits to EU migrants. Specifically, ministers want to stop those coming to the UK from claiming certain benefits until they have been resident for four years. Minsters have reportedly been warned by the UK's top civil servant this could be discriminatory and any limits may be reduced to less than a year\nSovereignty: Allowing Britain to opt out from the EU's founding ambition to forge an \"ever closer union\" of the peoples of Europe so it will not be drawn into further political integration. Giving greater powers to national parliaments to block EU legislation.\n...\nThe official UK government position is that a referendum will be held by the end of 2017 but Downing Street sources have said: \"If we can do it earlier we will.\"\nThere is speculation David Cameron is planning to hold the vote in 2016 to avoid a clash with French and German elections in 2017.\nThe prime minister wants treaty change but even if the referendum was held in 2017 there may not be enough time to legally incorporate any reforms into a treaty and it would have to be done at a later stage.\nAn early referendum would anger Eurosceptics who believe it would not allow enough time to make the case for exit or negotiate any meaningful concessions. http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-34803222 (Nov 12, 2015)\nThe council president said the chances of getting a deal on the UK's demands by the time EU leaders next met at a summit in a month's time were not high.\n\"Their requests are tough and this is why this matter was so interesting for me, but I have to say that it would be really difficult to find an agreement and, for sure, there is no guarantee that we can do this by December,\" said Mr Tusk.\nSpeaking to BBC Newsnight, French digital affairs minister Axelle Lemaire suggested there was \"no willingness, at least in the short term\" to change EU treaties to accommodate the UK's request to restrict newly-arrived EU citizens' access to benefits.\n\"This is not something that the French government would see as being reasonable... So there's the question of is it legal or not and there's the question of is it good to raise the issue at the moment and this, the timing is probably not so good,\" she said. http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/2015-2016/0002/cbill_2015-20160002_en_2.htm#pb1-l1g5 (European Union Referendum Bill (HC Bill 2)"], [584, "2015-12-01T14:43:06Z", [0.25], ""], [691, "2015-12-01T13:44:31Z", [0.32], ""], [1468, "2015-12-01T08:26:57Z", [0.17], ""], [12225, "2015-12-01T05:09:39Z", [0.2], ""], [12224, "2015-12-01T05:02:41Z", [0.22], ""], [61, "2015-12-01T02:45:20Z", [0.0], "going to zero for a bit, this one got away from me. moving down on links from redacted et al"], [12220, "2015-12-01T02:38:23Z", [0.2], ""], [11555, "2015-11-30T22:01:18Z", [0.1], "Too easy to keep postponing commitment to a date while claiming to negotiate terms for remaining in.

He cannot keep everybody on hold forever, so will likely need to make the jump sooner than later. The EU Commission Prez has talked tough, but has sent out a narrative about accommodating future EU changes:  \"One day we should rethink the European architecture with a group of countries that will do things, all things, together and others who will position themselves in an orbit different from the core.\" There is pressure financially from S&P and Moody's. S&P has taken a more negative initial position against a BREXIT, Moody's has been more circumspect. But seems like both prefer Britain to stay, rather than exit. A wild card is the current chaos introduced by extremists. This could turn some voters' heads. A key component of Cameron's narrative probably needs to include re-affirmation of strong, British, border control and better financial independence delivered from ongoing negotiations.

I am inclined to suspect the date will be set after the local elections to be held in many parts of England and Wales slightly later in May (and which , amongst other things, will serve as a test of the new Labour leadership, and evidence of public response to a UKIP whose public profile is rather lower than it has been for some time, and to a Conservative Party with around a year in majority government). Cameron does appear keen to call the referendum ASAP. The Government have earlier announced the intention to hold the referendum before the end of 2017 (but subsequently have appeared to give favour to a 2016 date) In terms of precedents, referendums in the UK are relatively rare, and a recent innovation. The most recent (and the only recent one to be held UK-wide), held on 5 May 2011 (on electoral reform), only had its date set by parliamentary vote three months earlier than that - obtaining royal assent on 16 February. The referendums on devolution to Scotland and Wales in 1997 again were held relatively shortly after they had been firmly approved. I don't have details to hand, but the referendums were held in September, and the Government that introduced them had only come to power in May. So, on these bases, were the date of a referendum to be agreed before 1 May 2016, the referendum could be expected to be held in the summer or early autumn of 2016. This is certainly not out of the question, but as yet nothing firm indicates this is the case. Another difficulty at present concerns the make up of the (now mostly appointed) House of Lords, in which the ruling Conservatives do not hold a majority, and have recently suffered some important defeats.
