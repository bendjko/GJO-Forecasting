Kavanaugh also seems uncomfortable broadening the original intent behind the 21st's language designed to let dry states stay dry. On the other hand, J. Gorsuch and J. Kagan pointed out that if they strike down the state's regulation, someone will likely come for the three-tiered system next. CJ Roberts might find a way to craft a narrow decision that lets the regulation stay in place without giving the states unlimited regulatory power. J. Thomas, based on his previous dissent, likely will not affirm the lower courts' rulings. If CJ Roberts can do that, then he'd have J. Thomas, himself, maybe J. Kagan and J. Gorsuch, and J. Breyer. But that would also overturn the previous rulings in Bacchus and Granholm that held the 21st Amendment did not allow states to violate the dormant Commerce Clause. Even at its highest overturning rate in 1950, 12% of the Court's cases overturned a prior decision. For the Roberts' Court, it has been between 1-7%.

The respondents are clear that they are not challenging the widely-accepted three-tier system. They are simply contending that the dormant Commerce Clause, which says regulations \"cannot discriminate against out-of-state interests or in favor of in-state interests,\" should not be overridden by the 21st Amendment simply because it is an alcohol-related regulation.  The most recent related case to this issue was Granholm v. Heald, in which the majority opinion stated that the Commerce Clause capable of limiting the 21st.  On a personal note, I find these regulations completely illogical, and have a hard time seeing how the TN Wine & Spirits Retailers Association can defend them. For example, according to the brief, a non-resident individual can legally attain and use a liquor license, but when it is time to renew that license a year later, the same individual could be ineligible due to the 10-year residency requirement. And, as lower courts have pointed out, the years on which residency is based are completely arbitrary. These factors weaken the petitioner's argument.  I have allotted 10% against a \"yes\" answer due to anticipated disagreement, particularly from Justice Thomas who voted against the Granholm case.
