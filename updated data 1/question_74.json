As the mayor of al-Ram pointed out on Wednesday, PA leaders can now claim that their policies are producing small but tangible steps toward Palestinian independence.\nThis development could not have been imaginable without ongoing Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation. Under former prime minister Salam Fayyad, the PA security forces were restructured with indispensable support from the United States Security Coordinator (USSC) and Jordan. Since then, security cooperation with Israel has reached unprecedented depth, breadth, consistency, and professionalism.\n[from the Washington Institute] If the Israeli public were aware of even some of the operational successes of the cooperation with the Palestinians \u2014 despite the obligatory mantle of secrecy \u2014 then public opinion might very well be less skeptical regarding Mahmoud Abbas' diplomatic intentions. Meanwhile, the fact is that Israel does have an appropriate, functioning security partner \u2014 while that diplomatic partner is subject to insults, scorn and scathing criticism among the Israeli leadership. Day-to-day follow-up of world jihad cell organizations in the West Bank is a joint interest of Israelis and Palestinians. The security cooperation to date proves that when there is a shared goal, there is someone to talk to and someone to rely on. And perhaps it behooves us to implement this lesson in the diplomatic circuit as well.

As a quid pro quo, he will offer to elevate Moscow to senior broker in the Israeli-Palestinian dispute, with Moscow or Geneva selected as the venue for direct Israeli-Palestinian talks, if they occur \u2013 and with US participation. Netanyahu is also keen on a role for Egypt\u2019s Presidents Abdek-Fattah al-Sisi.\ndebkafile sources in Jerusalem and Moscow report exclusively that the floating of this deal was the reason why Russia\u2019s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov abstained from attending the Mid East conference staged last weekend by France\u2019s President Francois Hollande in Paris. The UK and German foreign ministers followed the Russian lead and stayed away. \nAnd Friday, June 3, on the day of the Paris meeting, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikihail Bogdanov, who is in charge of Kremlin Middle East policy, offered a formula for resolving the problem of Israeli settlements on the West Bank.  That formula was very similar to the land swaps plan proposed by Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman a few years ago.\nIt consisted essentially of the transfer to the Palestinian state of parts of Israel with dense Arab populations, in return for Palestinian recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Israeli communities of Judea and Samaria.\nIn comments to Tass news service, Bogdanov said that Moscow is willing to host an Israeli-Palestinian peace conference, and also offered to mediate between the rival Palestinian factions, including Abu Mazen\u2019s Fatah and the radical Hamas which rules the aza Strip. \nWhile some Israeli politicians see the French initiative as offering President Barack Obama a handle for settling accounts with PM Netanyahu before he leaves the White House at the end of the year, Moscow and Jerusalem are concocting a parallel strategy - not merely to block the Franco-American move, but also to lift Washington\u2019s drive for an Israeli-Palestinian accord from Paris to Moscow.\ndebkafile sources say that this maneuver is based on the early stages of military and political coordination between Washington and Moscow in the Syrian arena, including the fight against ISIS.\nNo such coordination exists between Washington and Paris.\nNetanyahu envisages the tightening military cooperation between Russia and Israel for Syria, along with Israel\u2019s active participation in the airstrikes against ISIS, as becoming integral to American-Russian understandings, and extending also to the Israeli-Palestinian issue.\nMoscow and Jerusalem both estimate

Sunday.  The deal, which would be sealed ahead of the PA's visit to the UN to push anti-Israel draft resolutions, would see the IDF pull out of the region after decades of cooperation - and be seen as a major Palestinian victory. Under the terms of the agreement, if PA security forces fail to suppress terrorist elements within its jurisdiction, the IDF would not be able to help them battle the threat.  \"The PA, however, views the deal as a cessation of any and all security cooperation with Israel - a threat they have levied for years, and which some say is crucial to preventing further escalation of terrorist violence.  \"The deal remains to be sealed, and it is unclear whether it will require a formal vote from Israel's security cabinet. \n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT: Abbas hopes to go to the UN on April 22nd, it seems, so if there is a deal we'll likely know it by then.

After almost six months of random individual terror attacks on Israelis, West Bank Palestinians are coming to the conclusion that this round of violence \u2014 defined by some as a third intifada \u2014 is not producing any political benefit nor is it affecting Israeli public opinion or provoking an awakening of the international community. \"In a recent public opinion poll published on March 14 by the Jerusalem Media and Communication Center . . . .Support for Fatah in the West Bank and Gaza Strip is 35.5% as opposed to only 16.5% who support Hamas. Of those participating in the poll, 82% oppose the Islamic State. Most importantly, 69% of those responding support a two-state solution against only 24.8% who support a binational state. Surprisingly perhaps, 52.7% of the Palestinians favor security cooperation with Israel. \"These trends have not gone unnoticed by the leaders of Israel\u2019s security establishment. According to a senior Palestinian security official close to President Mahmoud Abbas, the discreet talks by officers of both sides are aimed at reaching new understandings regarding Israel\u2019s military activity in Palestinian cities in Area A. \"According to the Oslo Accord, the Palestinian Authority has full security and civilian jurisdiction over all Palestinian West Bank cities. Ever since Operation Defensive Shield in March 2002, Israel has decided, unilaterally, to allow its army to enter Palestinian cities for the arrest of suspected terrorists and inciters, despite Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation. Palestinians view this as an abolition of the Oslo Accord and a deepening of the occupation. \"The senior Palestinian security official told Al-Monitor on condition of anonymity that in these talks their side insisted on reinstating the situation on the ground precisely according to the Oslo Accord (pre-March 2002 status) in one move that would include all Palestinian cities \u2014 as a condition for continued security cooperation with Israel. \"The Israeli side, he said, insists that in instances of imminent danger alerts, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) would still be able to enter Palestinian cities. Furthermore, the Israeli generals suggested that this arrangement be carried out in Ramallah and Jericho first and then extend to other cities based on successful implementation of this pilot stage. The Palestinians rejected what they consider to be a staged and partial offer that would legitimate Israeli intrusion into the other Palestinian cities. \"The issue now rests with both political leaderships. According to a confidant of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who spoke to Al-Monitor on condition of anonymity, the prime minister and Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon gave a green light to this exploration between security officials and also shared this with US Vice President Joe Biden during his March 8 visit to Jerusalem. \"It is convenient for Netanyahu to stay behind the scenes of this initiative in order to keep deniability vis-a-vis his right-wing ministers. According to this Netanyahu adviser, who is also periodically involved in talks with the Palestinians, the initiative for these proposals came from the security establishment \u2014 both the IDF and the Shin Bet. They are extremely concerned with a possible deterioration of the current violence into a full-fledged armed intifada. They see, as also indicated in recent Palestinian polls, a public disillusionment with the current sporadic violence and believe that now is the opportune time for such an initiative. They also favor the creation of a Palestinian harbor in Gaza with outside Israeli security control for incoming shipments \u2014 something Netanyahu objects to. \"They, unlike the political level, give Abbas credit for his stand against violence and for the security cooperation with Israel. The higher echelons of the security establishment favor a political process, but understand that it cannot happen now in view of the current government composition. The move out of the Palestinian cities \u2014 although only a restoration of previous agreements \u2014 is something they believe would ameliorate the lives of Palestinians, alongside economic measures. \"There is a mirror image on the Palestinian security side to these Israeli assessments, with a skeptical political level that is hesitant to consider a partial agreement with Israel without a viable two-state solution. \"According to the senior Palestinian security official, their security establishment favors a comprehensive deal on reinstating full Palestinian security jurisdiction in the West Bank cities, as it is their duty to stabilize the internal situation vis-a-vis radical groups, primarily Hamas. \"Talking to both sides, one can conclude that even these very limited proposals have little chance to materialize. The Palestinian side is very suspicious that any such security arrangement would not be implemented by Israel. According to the Palestinian security official, \u201cIsrael feels and acts as the \u2018master\u2019 of the West Bank and is not capable of real security cooperation beyond giving us instructions.\u201d On the Israeli side, the security establishment has a more pragmatic understanding of the need to meet minimal Palestinian needs. The political level, and especially the prime minister, wants these explorations in order to stall international initiatives for the renewal of a negotiation process until after the American elections. Nothing will be done that could endanger Netanyahu's unholy alliance with the HaBayit HaYehudi party and the settlers. \"Therefore, one must take reports about secret security talks and so-called generous security proposals with a grain of salt. \"The only way for Israel to stop the current wave of violence is to engage in a realistic and viable two-state solution process.

But the proposal that Israel\u2019s defense establishment recently made to the PA \u2014 that security responsibility for Ramallah and Jericho return exclusively to the PA, and that the Israeli army stop making arrests in those areas \u2014 shows just how seriously it is taking the threat. \"The Israeli proposal was no mere whim. Representatives of all the relevant agencies \u2014 the army, the coordinator of government activities in the territories, and the Shin Bet security service \u2014 were at the meeting with PA officials at which the idea was presented. The proposal itself . . ..was also approved by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Moshe Ya\u2019alon \u2014 even though their own previous statements had indicated, any number of times, that they did not believe continued security coordination was in danger. \"Clearly, Israeli defense officials see an end to the cooperation as both a real concern and a realistic scenario in light of the developments taking place on the ground. \". . .  the Palestinian Authority turned down the proposal and instead demanded a clear timetable for the cessation of arrests not only in Ramallah and in Jericho but in all West Bank cities.\n. . .\n\"High-ranking Palestinian officials in Ramallah convey the sense that the PA has indeed become desperate enough to take such a measure \u2014 willing, like the biblical Samson with his Philistine foes, to go down along with Israel. These officials cite the absence of a diplomatic peace process, ongoing construction in the settlements, the arrests that are still taking place every day in West Bank cities, the feeble economy, and a young generation that is becoming increasingly hostile toward the PA and Abbas. All this, they say, has created a situation in which the PA and its security agencies face two main prospects: collapse due to Israeli measures (or the lack thereof), or collapse due to measures taken by the PA itself. \"Responding to the Israeli leadership\u2019s skepticism, given that the PA has been making these kinds of threats for a long time, this official said, \u201cWe are not in the same situation anymore. Many things have changed here recently.\u201d \"On the ground, security coordination seems highly effective, and is hailed as such by the Israeli security establishment. The arrests of terrorists and the exchange of intelligence between the sides continue; the PA security agencies break up demonstrations. But while, on the Israeli side, criticism has mounted over the role of Abbas and his hierarchy in encouraging the ongoing wave of Palestinian terrorism, on the Palestinian side, too, there is mirror-image talk of a lack of trust and hope, and a consequent collapse in the PA\u2019s credibility among its people. Frustration and despair are profound; the Palestinians no longer see any chance that their situation will improve in the foreseeable future. \"With no prospect of progress toward statehood, the PA and Fatah leaderships worry that their security coordination with Israel leaves them perceived as collaborators . . . There is also concern, in the current atmosphere, that discipline within the security agencies will weaken; Hamas has been working hard to encourage PA security officials to turn their guns on Israel.\n. . . \n\"Senior figures in the PA are well aware that Abbas and his hierarchy \u2014 and not just Israel \u2014 stand to suffer if the security cooperation ends. The partnership with Israel helps the PA counter Hamas and other opponents. An end to intelligence-sharing would prove deeply damaging \u2014 mutually so, given that the PA has prevented numerous terror attacks and plots against Israel, while Israel has exposed and prevented attacks on the PA. If an end to cooperation meant Israel did not allow Palestinian security troops to operate in certain areas, this could compromise the PA\u2019s basic ability to govern. Again, this heightens a concern among high-ranking PA officials that they could find themselves in a situation where the PA collapses and they are accused of having collaborated with the enemy. \"Some PA officials hold out the hope that Israel will yet consider ceasing military activity, gradually, in all West Bank. But given the widespread belief in Netanyahu\u2019s coalition that the current terror wave would be much more bloody were it not for the ongoing IDF and Shin Bet operations in those cities, there is little to no chance of this happening. \"Ultimately, both sides seem to be internalizing the fact that even amid the current bloodshed we are actually in a period of relative containment, relative calm, before the real storm: the cessation of security coordination, the collapse of the PA, a worsening of terror attacks, and quite a few other negative consequences.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  Israel & the PA are playing a game of chicken.

This will be the first step taken by the Palestinian leadership.\" \"This sounds curiously familiar: nearly a year has passed since leaders from the Palestinian Authority and Fatah first announced their decision to halt all forms of security coordination between the PA and Israel.\n. . . \n\"Palestinians consider the threats a smokescreen to conceal the continued security coordination with Israel which, they say, seems even to have increased in recent months. They say that President Abbas can probably fool Western leaders with these threats, but not his people, who have become used to hearing empty threats from their leaders. \"A senior Fatah official in Ramallah summed up the Palestinian Authority's dilemma: \"We are facing a complicated crisis. If we carry out the threat [to suspend security coordination with Israel], we will suffer; similarly, if we don't we will suffer.\" \"The situation, however, is not all about money: it is also about power. President Abbas and his security chiefs know perfectly well that the security coordination benefits them first and foremost. They are well aware that without Israel's help, Hamas would spread in the West Bank like a cancer, ultimately overthrowing the PA and replacing it with another Islamist regime like the one in the Gaza Strip. \"Abbas . .  in 2014, in front of a visiting Israeli group, he declared that security coordination with Israel was \"sacred.\" He added: \"We will continue with it even if we differ on political matters.\"  For Abbas, security coordination is indeed \"sacred\": it is keeping him in power and stopping Hamas from taking over the West Bank. Hence the security coordination -- in Abbas's words -- is very important for the Palestinian Authority - perhaps more than thwarting Hamas terror attacks against Israel.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  The first paragraph sums up my view of the situation.

Palestinians are distrustful of Abbas personally, but more than that, they are fed up with the entire PA system. Some 20 years after the PA was established as a temporary measure meant to bring Palestinians closer to peace and a state, the conflict persists. Palestinians increasingly see the PA as a tool of the Israeli occupation, which many doubt will ever end. A recent poll shows just how disaffected Palestinians have become with the status quo. The poll, conducted by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research (PCPSR) in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip from December 10 to 12, found that 68 percent of the public supports abandoning the Oslo agreement (which includes the establishment of PA rule). Similarly, 64 percent said the PA should stop all security cooperation with Israel. And 65 percent of respondents said they want Abbas to resign. Finally, the poll found that 66 percent of surveyed Palestinians (71 percent in the Gaza Strip and 63 percent in the West Bank) believe that an armed uprising would serve Palestinian interests in ways that negotiations could not. All this suggests that the PA's ability to keep the current violence from boiling over into a full-fledged intifada is diminishing, as is Palestinians' faith in the ability of the PA to produce positive results \u2014 namely, a peace deal with Israel, an end to the occupation, and the creation of an independent Palestinian state. If new legislative elections were held today, 71 percent say they would participate in such elections. Of those who would participate, 33 percent say they would vote for Hamas and 33 percent say they would vote for Fatah (Abbas's party). In June 2014, just before the Gaza war, vote for Hamas stood at 32 percent and Fatah at 40 percent. With support for the PA on the decline and support for Hamas on the rise, it is entirely reasonable to worry that a PA collapse could allow Hamas to fill the void in the West Bank. Some analysts, though, said they thought the odds of this happening were overstated \u2014 in large part because Israelis, Americans, and some Palestinians are working to prevent it. I spoke with Ilan Goldenberg, director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security and the former chief of staff to the special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations at the US Department of State, about how likely it is that the PA will collapse. Here's what he told me: While the collapse of the Palestinian Authority would be a game changer, with massive consequences in terms of Israelis and Palestinians and the possibility of a two-state solution, I would call it a medium- to low-probability event. That's what makes it so scary. It's not one of these far-fetched scenarios. I don't think anybody wants it to happen. Palestinians don't want it to happen. The Israelis don't want it to happen. Even folks like [Israeli Prime Minister] Bibi [Benjamin] Netanyahu don't want it to happen and neither does Abbas. Some are even more skeptical. Nathan Thrall, a senior analyst with the Middle East Program of the International Crisis Group covering Gaza, Israel, Jordan and the West Bank, called the threat of the PA collapsing in the near term \"extremely unlikely\" and said that \"Israel, the United States, and the PA leadership will do everything in their power to ensure that the PA survives and to bolster it if it appears to be slowly dissolving.\"\n---\nhttp://www.vox.com/2016/1/4/10690270/collapse-palestinian-authority"], [13377, "2016-01-10T02:53:43Z", [0.25], ""], [12591, "2016-01-10T01:12:31Z", [0.1], "The real politique would suggest that despite all the current problems they have with each other, they stillneed to cooperate on security"], [4273, "2016-01-10T01:10:13Z", [0.38], ""], [368, "2016-01-09T19:20:35Z", [0.02], ""], [4042, "2016-01-09T18:33:04Z", [0.01], ""], [691, "2016-01-09T17:54:49Z", [0.06], ""], [11788, "2016-01-09T13:47:17Z", [0.4], ""], [102, "2016-01-09T02:43:17Z", [0.16], ""], [73, "2016-01-09T01:37:00Z", [0.5], ""], [532, "2016-01-08T23:18:02Z", [0.4], "@AndrewSabisky links.

Opposing this is the fact that the agreement has kept Abbas and his close associates in power, against the likes of Hamas and more radical elements within his own party. The comment below is from the time of Abbas's UN speech, but is still valid as it highlights the internal conflict in the PA.  http://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/comment/2015/10/1/mr-abbas-youre-missing-the-point-the-security-agreement\n\"Mohammad Dahlan, the former head of the Palestinian Preventative Security forces, and Majid Farraj, head of the Palestinian General Intelligence services, are two frontrunners to succeed Abbas as president. This is due to a support base which is easy to placate, and an understanding of how to engage with their anti-Hamas allies, the Shin Bet. The overturning of the security agreement would not only remove their ace in the hole, but also consign their whole political class into a state of uncertainty. Abbas' words are thus hollow - not even he is crass enough to consign his political offspring to the wilderness.\" It appears from cmeinel's latest reference that Abbas may not be able to resist pressure from within for much longer. Three months have passed since his UN speech, the purpose of which was probably to stave off internal criticism, but there are still nearly six months to this question's deadline. Abbas is clearly on the horns of a dilemma.  Raising from 15% on the above basis.
