An infrastructure plan ought to include actual proposals, like revenue-and-spending details and timetables. The Trump infrastructure plan has little of that. Even the president\u2019s speech on Monday was devoid of specifics. (An actual line was: \u201cWe have studied numerous countries, one in particular, they have a very, very good system; ours is going to top it by a lot.\u201d) The ceremonial signing on Monday was pure theater. The president, flanked by politicians and businesspeople smiling before the twinkling of camera flashes, signed a paper that merely asks Congress to work on a bill. An assistant could have done that via email. Meanwhile, Congress isn\u2019t working on infrastructure at all, according to Politico, and Republicans have shown no interest in a $200 billion spending bill. In short, this \u201cplan\u201d is not a plan, so much as a Potemkin policy, a presentation devised to show the press and the public that the president has an economic agenda. The show continued on Wednesday, as the president delivered an infrastructure speech in Cincinnati that criticized Obamacare, hailed his Middle East trip, and offered no new details on how his plan would work.
