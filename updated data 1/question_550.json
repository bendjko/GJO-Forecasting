I didn't know you could be downgraded below \"junk\" but obviously you can if the question is asking. It looks like the lack of cash reserves and relatively limited oil and gas, not to mention lack of a diversified economy, is making Oman and Bahrain vulnerable. Qatar is also in danger of a downgrade. There's no evidence the diplomatic standoff that is currently happening will be resolved any time soon as tensions in the region rise and Saudi Arabia is determined to make Qatar a client state similar to its' other neighbors. Qatar has larger reserves, more cash, and a more diversified economy but the risk remains high.  Saudi is in better shape, it's a larger country with more reserves and more oil. They also are attempting to diversify the economy. However, the risk remains. MBS is inexperienced and there is plenty of evidence that he is not managing the delicate balance between political stability and economic reform with his aggressive posture. He also has Saudi embroiled in a war with Yemen. Wars aren't good for debt rating. Mitigating this forecast is the rising price of oil. However even the most enthusiastic forecasts don't have the price of oil much above $100. I've also adjusted my forecast given what the \"crowd\" is saying. The vast majority have assigned a 90-95% probability of 3 countries being downgraded, so I didn't want to be too far off of that result.
