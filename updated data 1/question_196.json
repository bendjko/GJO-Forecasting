But these sanctions \u2013 which appear more like community-service orders than proper prison sentences \u2013 seem shockingly disproportionate to the gravity of these terrible crimes against children. \"Even more troubling, perhaps, the peace deal also includes a misleading definition of \u201ccommand responsibility\u201d \u2013 a key principle of international humanitarian law \u2013 that could be used to allow FARC commanders to escape responsibility for atrocities committed by troops under their control, often according to abusive policies developed by them.\n~~~~~~~\nhttp://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2016/08/12/colombia-govt-farc-want-involvement-pope-un-in-peace-tribunal-process/ HAVANA \u2013  The Colombian government and FARC guerrillas on Friday unveiled the independent mechanism they have negotiated for selecting judges for special peace tribunals, a process in which they will seek to enlist the participation of Pope Francis, [the Criminal Chamber of Colombia's Supreme Court, the International Center for Transitional Justice's Colombian delegation and the Standing Committee of the State University System] and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon.  \"The negotiating teams in Havana announced on Sept. 23, 2015, the creation of a so-called Special Jurisdiction for Peace, a controversial decision that established a Tribunal for Peace and other judicial bodies. The Tribunal for Peace will be made up of 24 judges - 20 of them Colombian and four from other countries. \"A group of separate chambers to handle matters such as acknowledgment of truth and responsibility, amnesty and determination of legal status will be made up of 18 Colombian judges and six foreigners. \"These bodies will try those accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity, while \"political crimes\" or offenses of lesser severity will be eligible for amnesty. \"The Colombian government and the FARC announced a historic cease-fire deal on June 23, but peace negotiators are still working in Havana to resolve pending issues prior to the signing of a definitive peace agreement at a still-undetermined date. \"Those pending issues include loose ends of four other points on which agreement has already been reached: land reform, political participation, drugs and drug crop, and redress for the victims of the strife. \"Negotiators also are still discussing one final point on the agenda: implementation, verification and countersignature of the peace deal, which the Colombia government insists must be approved by popular referendum.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  The first piece helped me understand why so many Colombians are opposed to the deal as they understand it.

I noticed that at several points reference is made to \"the next few months\", and it seems to me that each of the issues mentioned (incomplete negotiations, possibility of needing to 'water down' the agreement, decisions about and organization of the approval process) will take time. https://www.stratfor.com/analysis/colombias-peace-talks-hit-snag \" . . . One issue that has yet to be resolved, however, could hold up further progress toward peace: the lack of popular support for it. Unless the government can get its people on board with the FARC agreement, or find a way to ratify it without the public's buy-in, a conclusive end to Colombia's decadeslong conflict may remain just out of reach. \"Roughly 50 percent of Colombian respondents plan to vote against ratifying Bogota's peace agreement with the FARC, according to an Aug. 8 Ipsos poll. Only 39 percent said they would vote in favor of the deal, while the rest were undecided. The results are concerning for the Colombian government, which is still trying to determine how an eventual accord would be ratified, should it be reached. If Bogota decides that submitting the deal to a national vote that it could very well lose would pose too big a risk to the peace process, it will have to find an alternative way of ratifying the agreement.  \"For the FARC, however, time is of the essence. If a deal has not been signed and ratified by the time Colombia elects its new president in mid-2018, the future of the peace process will be anything but certain. By law, President Juan Manuel Santos cannot run for a third term in office, and his National Unity coalition will likely break apart so that Cambio Radical and the Liberal Party can field their own presidential candidates. There is therefore a real chance that a more conservative government, led by Centro Democratico, will assume power after the next election, a possibility that has added to the sense of urgency surrounding the current talks. \"Given the sweeping and transformational nature of the deal in the making, it will likely have to be approved by a popular vote of some kind. After all, the peace agreement could involve awarding seats in the Colombian Senate and Chamber of Representatives to FARC members and granting complete amnesty to a sizable segment of the insurgency. Without the public's backing, such an accord would lack political legitimacy, potentially making it more vulnerable to legal challenges or overturn down the road. To guard against these outcomes, the government and the FARC have three options for ratification: a referendum, a plebiscite or a constitutional assembly. \"Over the past year, Bogota has leaned toward the plebiscite option, primarily because a congressional agreement in November 2015 stipulated that a plebiscite would require the approval of only 13 percent of voters (less than 4.5 million votes) to succeed. The FARC, however, prefers the constitutional assembly. From its point of view, sealing the peace deal into the Colombian Constitution would make it much more difficult to repeal later on. For now, the government seems to have won the debate: In July, the Colombian Constitutional Court approved Bogota's request to hold a plebiscite in late 2016, though it has not yet issued the final ruling needed to organize the vote. Colombian Interior Minister Juan Fernando Cristo has even said the vote could be held as early as September. \"Over the next few months, the FARC and the government will have to decide whether to commit to the plebiscite or find another means of ending the conflict. The plebiscite has its risks; it would give the Centro Democratico opposition a chance to campaign against the peace deal ahead of the vote. Then again, the other two options would require a higher level of support to pass. Moreover, a constitutional assembly could create significant delays as representatives are elected and topics of reform are selected. \"The possibility of a close vote in the plebiscite also raises the question of whether Bogota and the FARC will be forced to water down their agreement to make it more palatable to the public. Losing the vote would leave the peace deal in uncharted territory, and though Bogota has other mechanisms it could turn to, the prospect of such uncertainty will shape how the government and the FARC proceed. The insurgency's demands for political concessions, including 10 seats in the legislature's upper house and representation in the lower house for all of the departments in which the group operates, may have to be trimmed back. Both sides have come too far to abandon the peace talks, which means the FARC might simply have to adjust its expectations of how good a bargain it can get from the Colombian government. \"The coming months, therefore, will be crucial in determining what kind of peace \u2014 if any \u2014 will materialize in Colombia. The FARC and the government are closer than ever to striking a deal, but if the public continues to oppose it, the process of ending Colombia's longest-running insurgency will become even more complicated."], [67, "2016-08-12T04:08:08Z", [0.02, 0.22, 0.0, 0.75, 0.01], ""], [506, "2016-08-12T03:16:49Z", [0.0, 0.18, 0.0, 0.55, 0.27], ""], [12591, "2016-08-11T22:22:20Z", [0.4, 0.2, 0.0, 0.1, 0.3], ""], [691, "2016-08-11T21:43:11Z", [0.06, 0.31, 0.0, 0.63, 0.0], ""], [368, "2016-08-11T16:28:17Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [368, "2016-08-11T16:26:23Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2016-08-11T02:26:24Z", [0.05, 0.23, 0.0, 0.72, 0.0], ""], [1646, "2016-08-10T23:01:21Z", [0.05, 0.85, 0.0, 0.05, 0.05], ""], [23117, "2016-08-10T17:33:12Z", [0.13, 0.57, 0.0, 0.3, 0.0], ""], [368, "2016-08-10T17:19:19Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [368, "2016-08-10T17:18:34Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [1708, "2016-08-10T13:50:01Z", [0.0, 0.4, 0.0, 0.6, 0.0], ""], [691, "2016-08-09T20:56:32Z", [0.05, 0.23, 0.0, 0.72, 0.0], ""], [368, "2016-08-09T16:46:27Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [14493, "2016-08-09T08:59:50Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.0, 0.9, 0.0], ""], [73, "2016-08-09T00:21:07Z", [0.3, 0.3, 0.0, 0.05, 0.35], ""], [73, "2016-08-09T00:09:59Z", [0.25, 0.25, 0.0, 0.25, 0.25], ""], [83, "2016-08-08T23:15:35Z", [0.0, 0.36, 0.0, 0.0, 0.64], ""], [691, "2016-08-08T20:14:41Z", [0.05, 0.21, 0.0, 0.74, 0.0], ""], [368, "2016-08-08T17:41:35Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [19923, "2016-08-08T14:26:19Z", [0.01, 0.09, 0.0, 0.9, 0.0], "Down 5% in July to September, and up 5% for between October and December due to passage of time and lack of agreement.

This referendum have to be recognize legally by the Constitutional Court [4]. Only then we will see if the government (the executive branch of government) have reached a final peace agreement or not. I think that the president of Colombia should be considered as a the ultimate figure of the government (executive branch).

The agreement includes a commitment from the FARC to combat the production and trafficking of illegal drugs, substitute other crops for former coca fields, and a government promise to devote massive spending toward a viable alternative for people in areas once controlled by the rebels.\n. . . \n\"Under the terms of the eventually-hoped-for peace accord, the FARC is supposed to help the government eradicate coca crops. In return, the government has to effectively build a modern state in remote areas, committing to development projects such as building roads, and creating more equitable land ownership for farmers. \n~~~~~~~\nhttp://www.chinapost.com.tw/commentary/afp/2016/06/26/470341/Colombia-at.htm \"A historic ceasefire between the Colombian government and FARC rebels marks a \"point of no return\" on the road to peace but risks still lie ahead, analysts say. \"This is a very important step forward\" in the talks . . . said Ariel Avila, a political scientist at Bogota's Externado University and deputy director of the Foundation for Peace and Reconciliation. \"It may not be the final agreement, but we're already at the point of no return,\" Alejo Vargas, coordinator of the National University's Center for Reflection and Monitoring of the Peace Dialogues, added . . . \"This agreement is the decisive point in the negotiations and will lead to the finalization of the conflict with the FARC,\" . . .  said Jorge Restrepo, director of the Conflict Analysis Resource Center (CERAC). \"With agreements on the ceasefire, demobilization, disarmament and action against paramilitary groups, the accord \"achieved 95 percent\" of what was on the agenda at the talks, Avila said. For Vargas, the \"negotiations are irreversible and what remains (to be done) has been reduced to implementing the signed agreements.\" These include deals struck over recent years on land reform, the FARC's future political role, illegal drugs, reparation for victims and finally the ceasefire. \"The agreement is lacking on a few \"delicate\" points, Avila said: the reintegration of FARC members, the means of ratifying the accord and FARC demands for discussions over agricultural land, drugs and the media.\n~~~~~~~\nhttp://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2016/06/25/farc-cease-fire-has-colombian-youth-seeing-peace-for-first-time/ \"Colombia's largest rebel group has signed a cease-fire, demobilization and disarmament deal that will take effect once it and the government sign a final accord to end 52 years of fighting. \"People in the capital hugged and cried when President Juan Manuel Santos shook hands with Rodrigo Londono, commander of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. . . .\nSantos has said he thinks the accord could come as early as next month, although negotiators have missed a series of other government-announced deadlines.\n. . .\n\"The deal does not mean an immediate halt to conflict or the start of rebels surrendering their arms. That will begin only after a final peace deal is formally signed.\n. . . \n\"After four years of peace talks, attention is shifting now to a referendum that Santos has promised to give Colombians a final say on its acceptance.
