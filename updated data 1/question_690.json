However, these plans have been seriously hampered by President Donald Trump\u2019s recent decision to exit the 2015 nuclear deal and re-impose sanctions on the Islamic Republic. To handle the problem, Iran now plans to issue bonds to fund oil projects and has already offered such projects both in national and foreign currency-denominated bonds.\nhttps://sputniknews.com/business/201806131065374942-iran-sanctions-bonds"], [691, "2018-06-11T13:09:44Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [27409, "2018-06-10T13:34:56Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "They will issue yuan bonds in 2019."], [47482, "2018-06-09T19:25:38Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.1, 0.89], "Affirming"], [691, "2018-06-08T13:48:41Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [58391, "2018-06-06T15:01:45Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [58678, "2018-06-06T06:46:21Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [57918, "2018-06-05T18:47:43Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [1993, "2018-06-04T22:49:16Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95], "No news on this."], [691, "2018-06-04T11:43:10Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [42472, "2018-06-03T17:11:13Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [691, "2018-06-03T13:00:13Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [41460, "2018-06-03T12:58:18Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.04, 0.35, 0.61], "Updating significantly for absence of any relevant indications for a short timeline.

Still, rating agencies are reported to be working on the issue. There has been news about a new bond issue since Dec 2015 but no action. Issuing foreign currency bonds seems to be a risky proposition given that further currency depreciation will increase the cost of interest and principal repayments. Getting currency out of the domestic market would be hard given the 'street' exchange rate is so much higher than the official rate.  Bloomberg and Mauldin Economics track both the official and 'street' exchange rates for the Rial vs USD. Official rates were adjusted in April '18 to devalue the Rial by around 13% to 42,000 per USD.\nStreet rates have soared from around 48,000 in Feb '18 to 61,000 in April '18 (27%) despite government intervention that briefly pushed rates back down in Feb/Mar '18. This indicates a potential foreign currency reserve problem for the Central Bank of Iran as they expend foreign reserves trying to maintain an official rate that is much lower than the 'street' (market) rate. A point that caught my attention was that Bank officials warned currency speculators (presumably short Rial speculators) that they were heading for losses because the Bank could control the foreign exchange market (https://financialtribune.com/articles/economy-business-and-markets/81597/central-bank-of-iran-to-issue-forex-bonds-for-the-first). I have a few ideas;\n1 The Central Bank of Iran has a foreign currency reserve issue which it intends to address with a foreign bond issue. 2. The Central Bank of Iran has a foreign currency reserve problem and it's trying to 'talk' the exchange rate back down by warning of an intervention and taking about a bond issue.  3. There's no foreign currency reserve problem seems the Central Bank of Iran is issuing bonds for other reasons.  Still,I think that getting a bond issue out quickly is unlikely given the amount of time it has already been in the news for.
