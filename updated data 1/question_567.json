I must say, I really don't get this question and the other questions that call for a forecast of whether a particular monitoring group will identify a given (prospective) incident in a given way. I also don't understand in what way these data sets are all that useful, and would be happy to hear from someone in the know exactly what their utility is .

There were three separate events which resulted in a total of 14 deaths and all perpetrators were in the unknown classification.  The two targeted assassinations were of environmental activists and both occurred in March of last year.  An attempted assassination of an environmental activist occurred July, 4 of this year.  There also may be a power vacuum with the recent conviction and looming extradition of drug kingpin 'Chepe Handal'.  I believe there is a chance for gang violence or another assassination of an environmentalist.
