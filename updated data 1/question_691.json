A couple of overarching thoughts went into my forecast:\n- I am taking the word \"fatality\" literally...i am not accounting for abductions, arrests, or detentions. If no lethal force was used it is not a fatality opportunity.\n- I think of every exchange of fire in the historic record as an equal \"opportunity\" for a fatality. So I didn't really care if somebody died or not, I just cared if somebody was willing enough to pull a trigger/use lethal force against the other side.\n- I think we are in a \"high tension\" year a la 1994, 1996, 2002, and 2010 leading me to plus up the overall likelihood of a fatality in line with what occurred those years compared to average or non-tension years. In all but 1994, there were standoffs that either resulted in fatalities or significant fatality opportunities that occurred prior to October. On average the bulk of fatality opportunities occur outside the first quarter of the calendar year. With an impending meeting between KJU and Trump to occur by May I think the probabilities are even lower.  The hard bit is the second quarter of the calendar year (1 April - 30 June). The KJU-Trump visit will occur right in the middle of it. Prior to the visit I do think the probabilities for a fatality are minimal (think something accidental). After the meeting however, there is the potential for raised expectations of a solution or detente leading to disappointment as well as the always dangerous Blue Crab fishing season in the West Sea. Will have to wait and see how the KJU-Trump meeting goes. If it goes badly, this probability will rise. If it goes well, it will decrease substantially. Third quarter factors are the thought that the raised expectations being disappointed factor would likely have occurred by then and the start of the late summer/early fall US-ROK military series of exercises being something that would dampen the environment for fatality opportunities. Should the KJU-Trump meeting go well, I will substantially reduce this probability. Biggest concerns/weaknesses of my forecast:\n- Weighting all use of lethal force the same. There are clearly differing degrees of lethal force that may or may not lead to an actual fatality, e.g. DMZ border firings are not necessarily aiming to kill but just to warn. There just isn't sufficient detail in the reports to tell which ones were more lethal than the others so I preferred to weight them equally."], [54186, "2018-03-09T11:43:43Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [33637, "2018-03-09T11:16:09Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.05, 0.15, 0.75], ""], [3474, "2018-03-09T09:26:05Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.2, 0.6], ""], [1034, "2018-03-09T08:40:27Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [36188, "2018-03-09T08:36:42Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.98], ""], [41922, "2018-03-09T08:17:24Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.03, 0.97], ""], [12302, "2018-03-09T04:09:55Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.04, 0.95], ""], [38, "2018-03-09T02:32:37Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [368, "2018-03-09T00:23:10Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [1034, "2018-03-08T08:07:38Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [368, "2018-03-07T22:34:30Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [36309, "2018-03-07T22:06:25Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.05, 0.9], ""], [691, "2018-03-07T21:21:51Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.04, 0.96], ""], [31450, "2018-03-07T18:23:29Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.97], "Shifting my predictions to later in the year due to passage of time."], [43003, "2018-03-07T17:02:55Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.09, 0.83], "Updating for reports of US White house planning 'bloody nose' and demonstration of a unhinged president who would actually order it.  +3 to 1APR18-30JUN18, +3 to 01JUL18-30SEP18, "], [1333, "2018-03-07T16:23:07Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.15, 0.75], ""], [38554, "2018-03-07T16:00:21Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.94], ""], [49608, "2018-03-07T15:11:32Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.27, 0.47, 0.25], ""], [172, "2018-03-07T12:44:57Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.97], ""], [1034, "2018-03-07T07:29:31Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [41586, "2018-03-07T01:55:39Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.05, 0.89], "Recent summit probably means March will be quiet.

He comes into conflict with everyone and is incapable of getting along with anyone. His reaction to problematic situations of any sort is to lash out destructively at family, staff, other world leaders, etc. The North Korean issue is certainly not immune to this dynamic and will only get worse in the future as this sort of situation precludes formation of a realistic responsible policy towards anything.\n Several things are happening now that are unsettling and it appears as though they will continue to destabilize our relationship North Korea, South Korea and China.\n    The very possible resignation of HR McMaster who will more likely than not be replaced by a loyalist or a John Bolton type of hawk.\n     John Kelly's weakened position as chief of staff as he tries to shore up a White House that is coming unraveled as he goes up against the president's closest aides and his family. The Mueller investigation will only add to the uncertainty and exacerbate the chaos.\n       The failure to appoint the South Korean pick for Ambassador due to their reticence for military intervention in North Korea.

Historically in the past 15 to 18 years the vast majority of conflicts and fatalities have happened in a maritime environment.

The US also may commit itself to special-forces attacks that specifically target the PRK's nuclear (or ICBM) capabilities, which would also result in at least one death, inevitably.  One major wild-card I did not include in my calculations is the high plausibility that the generals and high-ups in the Pentagon are stalling for time and way-laying by any means possible an armed conflict until Trump is out of office.

If no lethal force was used it is not a fatality opportunity.\n- I think of every exchange of fire in the historic record as an equal \"opportunity\" for a fatality. So I didn't really care if somebody died or not, I just cared if somebody was willing enough to pull a trigger/use lethal force against the other side.\n- I think we are in a \"high tension\" year a la 1994, 1996, 2002, and 2010 leading me to plus up the overall likelihood of a fatality in line with what occurred those years compared to average or non-tension years. In all but 1994, there were standoffs that either resulted in fatalities or significant fatality opportunities that occurred prior to October. On average the bulk of fatality opportunities occur outside the first quarter of the calendar year. I weighted the first quarter even lower than the historic average due to the Winter Olympics this year as well as the high probability that ROK-DPRK talks will occur soon after. Despite the historical instance of a military confrontation occurring during the 2002 World Cup I think the political pressure will be on for the North and South not to instigate anything during this period.  I increased the probability for the second quarter over the high tension season average by what I decreased from the first quarter due to the fear of raised expectations for a solution or detente to occur leading to disappointment coinciding with the resumption of postponed spring US-ROK exercises (re-start dates have no yet been announced) as well as the start of the Blue Crab fishing season in the West Sea.  Third quarter factors are the thought that the raised expectations being disappointed factor would likely have occurred by then and the start of the late summer/early fall US-ROK military series of exercises being something that would dampen the environment for fatality opportunities. Biggest concerns/weaknesses of my forecast:\n- Heavy weight given to the dampening effect of the Winter Olympics (no real historic comparison). This is largely a \"gut\"/experience call which I know is discouraged.\n- Weighting all use of lethal force the same. There are clearly differing degrees of lethal force that may or may not lead to an actual fatality, e.g. DMZ border firings are not necessarily aiming to kill but just to warn. There just isn't sufficient detail in the reports to tell which ones were more lethal than the others so I preferred to weight them equally.

I think it's unlikely to result in a fatality but I'll put the odds as slightly higher than base. I also put the odds slightly higher for that same period because traditionally there have been more US-SK joint exercises around February-March for the last couple of years, which I would think increases the general risk of some retaliatory action.

Measuring cost per unit citation in intelligence products, including things like the presidential daily briefing found that per citation, open source intelligence was less than one-tenth the cost. This was an unclassified result. We have done some work here at IARPA looking at the relative accuracy of open source and classified intelligence, including as part of a program called \u201cAce\u201d that we ran here, in which you had people who lacked clearances, who made judgments about the same questions that were also posed to people who had clearances. And on most events, the difference in accuracy wasn\u2019t significant. But there was a subset of events for which the differences in accuracy were significant and where classified information seems to make a big difference. Broader topics, things like how political elections would turn out, or whether there would be civil unrest, whether there would be disease outbreaks \u2013 those were the kinds of questions where unclassified information was often quite relevant. Same was also true for economic forecasts. So these forecasts about events where information is already pretty widely distributed, in which there are multiple observers and multiple participants \u2013 things such as for political elections, economic events, epidemics and science and technology \u2013 all of those were cases are where unclassified information was highly accurate, at least when aggregated in ways that were empirically well founded. Think of the other category of events, where you don\u2019t have many participants, you don\u2019t have lots of observable data [and] there aren\u2019t unclassified or open source datasets that are highly relevant. That includes topics like weapons tests or leadership decisions in countries that have tightly controlled information. I think one of the best things to look at is the head-to-head comparisons of unclassified versus classified information, and how accurate judgments are based on either sets of information.\" So I note that Forecasting on questions like this certainly  adds value for all.\nBut statistically on average OSINT alone is not enough for these categories of questions Mr. Matheny is a lot brighter and experienced and resourced than me. no comparison.\nbut I think the counter-argument can be made that in closed systems like\nDPRK, OSINT analysis may be as, or more reliable\nEspecially since Mr. Matheny notes that there is a bias towards classified info as\nmore reliable,  and any Humint from DPRK  may be unreliable at least for accurate\npredictions on testing.\n@Anneinak you have served so well so long and participated\nin ACE: what are your thoughts on  this issue\nspecifically are our forecasts here more reliable on accuracy measure\nfor DPRK, than OSINT combined with classsified\nLike to know as I think we are testing that hypothesis every day\nSo we may be more accurate on DPRK than classified  assessments\nas we do not bias in classified.\nHappy Holidays and Merry Christmas \ncc: @Wildwood2000\n @aaseawaf15"], [41724, "2017-12-05T09:24:48Z", [0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.06, 0.88], "North Korea's missile and nuclear programs are not as advanced as commonly reported.

Yi further describes the facility as \u201c\u2026a factory which synthesizes propulsion fuel for ballistic missiles\u201d and that Dr. Yi Sung Ki\u2014the \u201cfather\u201d of North Korea\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile programs, and the inventor of vinalon\u2014took an active role in the factory\u2019s development and operations as an early director of the Academy of Defense Sciences.[11] Yi Pok Ku\u2019s account does not provide greater details about the type of \u201cfuel for ballistic missiles\u201d being produced, but it is clear from the timing that it was too early to be UDMH for the chronological reasons noted above. He was likely conflating production of AK-20K/TG-02 with later production of other fuels for the P-15 (SS-N-2 styx) anti-ship cruise missile,[12] which uses these propellants and was then in domestic production.[13] During the past five years, a number of infrastructure changes have occurred within the July 27 Factory, although it is unclear whether these are related to the national-level chemical industry modernization program noted above. It stands to reason that a factory designed and built to produce dangerous chemical weapons and highly toxic and corrosive missile fuel, and is still in operation, would be a strong candidate for the production of UDMH. Finally, there has long been a close relationship between the July 27 Factory and nearby July 21 Factory (a.k.a., 7.21 Factory or Kyonghung Explosives Plant), located 1.5 kilometers to the northeast (42.534961\u00b0 130.361007\u00b0), which produces explosives and chemicals used in the manufacture of explosives (e.g., ammonia, etc.), and maintains an extensive storage facility. Whether this relationship extends to potential UDMH production (e.g., sharing of scientists and technicians, supply of chemicals, provision of storage, etc.) is unclear.\" Figure 1.

At the moment I assume they do. ------ ======   Summary of Approach =====----- First step was to get the baseline probability of loss of life due to strife between North & South.   To do this, I went through all the interactions between the North & South since 1980.  The results were pretty grim. Probability of at least 1 incident where life was lost (38 total incidents): 1980's) 80% \n1990's) 60%\n2000's) 60%\n2010's) 43% Average Annual Probability: 61% Here's the wrinkle:  Even though tensions are really high at the moment, the probability of incident is lower in the recent years than in the past decades.  While I could be \"fooled by randomness\" in this regard, I suspect it is probably deliberate.  Thus, I'm taking a slightly lower than average probability than history would suggest, and closer to the 2010's probability (47%).  Note that since we are not forecasting a full year, this equates to a 41% remaining probability. As far as the distribution of incidents over the year.   Incidents by Quarter:\nFirst Quarter: 8\nSecond Quarter: 7\nThird Quarter: 9\nFourth Quarter: 14 While there are more during the 4th quarter, it does not meet the statistical threshold.  As such, the daily probability based on a 47% annual probability is:  0.13% Spreading this probability over the relevant dates for the question results in my forecast Hope this helps.

The trip to Pyongyang on Friday by Song Tao, the head of the international department at the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), comes one week after Xi and U.S. President Donald Trump held a summit in Beijing last Thursday. The report said that Song will inform North Korea of the results of China's recent party congress, in which Xi cemented his power as he entered his second five-year term. North Korea's state news agency said in a short dispatch that Song will visit the North \"soon,\" without revealing details. Trump finished his 13-day tour of Asia Tuesday, which included stops in South Korea and China. Trump has said that China should do more to rein in its wayward neighbor. North Korea's ties with China, its main ally and economic benefactor, have been frayed over Pyongyang's persistent advancement of its nuclear and missile programs. China has implemented U.N. sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear and missile tests. \"China and North Korea will exchange opinions about issues of mutual concern including party-to-party matters and bilateral ties, along with the party congress,\" Geng Shuang, spokesman at China's foreign ministry, said in a briefing.

They are unlikely to strike first, and even if they wanted to, neither of the three countries' elite have the political appetite for a new, costly, long war with a Chinese proxy. \nIf hostilities do break out, they are much more likely to be triggered by the DPRK. What would need to happen in order for the DPRK to feel the need to violently confront Japan, the US, or South Korea? \nThe North Koreans would need to feel so insecure that they would calculate that provoking any or all three of these countries, and risking retaliation would be worth the the initial aggression. These actions take place in the wider context of the American and Japanese governments. Both Trump and Abe have emphasized military force, with Abe attempting to inch his country away from post-WW2 pacifism. The North Koreans, for all their rhetoric, are rational actors that point to the fall of Saddam and Ghaddafi as evidence that rogue regimes need nukes to survive. In order for them to risk provoking the US, Japan, or South Korea, they would need to be in a position of strength to feel confident about their own regime's survival. Only a nuclear missile capable (which many sources state that the North Koreans are about a year away from producing) of hitting the US would provide them with sufficient security and self-confidence to ratchet up tensions in this way. This is why my forecast is set at 4% around mid-year 2018. However, there is the possibility that the North Koreans miscalculate and misjudge the nature of a military exercise, or have incorrect intelligence about military movements near them. They may also take news reports of 'decapitation raids' on their leadership seriously and might--during a time of heightened tensions--misjudge flights, border movements, etc, as advance warning of a raid. This could also trigger fatal conflict. The Koreans do not have the modern battlefield experience required to save injured soldiers and are most likely to lose a soldier in such a confrontation. There is also the possibility that a civilian is accidentally or intentionally killed near the border. However, such events are rare.
