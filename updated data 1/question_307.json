Gerd Gigerenzer discusses this issue in the Behavioral Economics Guide 2016.  In the introductory article titled Taking Heuristics Seriously, he speaks of two sources of error:  bias and variance.  How do these sources of error impact a prediction?  To arrive at that question, Gigerenzer initially brings up the assumption of the accuracy-effort trade-off and how that trade-off might not apply in all cases.  In doing this, he compares situations of \u201crisk\u201d versus situations of \u201cuncertainty\u201d.  That trade-off does not necessarily apply in situations of \u201cuncertainty\u201d as opposed to situations of \u201crisk\u201d.  The bias-variance dilemma is the mathematical principle that assists in helping one understand that playoff.

A majority of the survey respondents saw the downward trend for agricultural land values continuing into the fourth quarter of 2016: 58 percent of the responding bankers anticipated a decrease in farmland values in the final quarter of 2016, while less than 1 percent anticipated an increase.\" From the data back to the 60s, c. 75% of quarters are positive percentage change and c. 25% are flat or negative. Valuation fundamentals continue to deteriorate: Yields up: \"The USDA forecasted that the five District states\u2019 harvest of corn for grain in 2016 would rise by 11 percent from 2015, establishing a new record. Likewise, soybean production for the five District states in 2016 was projected to break the record, set just last year\u2014this year\u2019s soybean harvest should exceed 2015\u2019s by 9.2 percent, according to USDA projections.\" Prices overall down: \"For the third quarter of 2016, prices for corn\u2014the District\u2019s largest cash crop\u2014were down relative to the third quarter of the prior year. According to the USDA, corn prices averaged $3.34 per bushel in the third quarter of 2016, down 9.3 percent from the previous quarter and down 10 percent from a year ago. However, soybean prices, with an average of $9.85 per bushel in the third quarter of 2016, were up 2.0 percent from the previous quarter and up 3.0 percent from a year ago.\" From the Iowa State Farmland Value Survey (https://www.extension.iastate.edu/AGDM/wholefarm/html/c2-70.html)\n\"Although modest, the 5.9 percent decline represents a three-year streak where average Iowa farmland values have shown a decline, which is the first time this has happened since the 1980s. For a pessimist, there are plenty of legitimate reasons to worry:\n-according to USDA, net farm income dropped another 17.2 percent to $66.9 billion in August 2016, and this represents the lowest since 2009 in both real and nominal terms.\n-financial stress in the agricultural sector shows slow but steady increase, with continued declines in loan repayment rates and uptakes in farm real estate and working capital debt.\n-while corn and soybean prices continue to fall short of production costs, livestock producers faced a tougher environment in 2016 with hog, cattle, and dairy prices all down by at least 30 percent compared to two years ago.\" Interest rates rose with the Fed hiking rates, sending the 10 year Treasury up to 2.30% - 2.60% as opposed to a Q3 range of c. 1.35% - 1.75%, increasing buyer discount rates and increasing the cost in interest rate for new loans (and affecting existing variable i.r. loans as well). These factors all point to a continued decline in farmland values. On the other hand, valuation and discounted cash flows are not necessarily the determinants of short term pricing for land. Supply of land coming to market is expected to be significantly below previous years. From the Iowa State survey: \"ver half, (61 percent) of respondents reported lower sales in 2016 relative to 2015. On the other end of the spectrum, just 10 percent reported more sales, and 29 percent reported the same level of sales in 2016 relative to 2015.\" AND \"Existing farmers represented 74 percent of the sales, with local farmers making of 72 percent and 2 percent to relocating farmers.\" Existing farm buyers might be happy to buy land that comes for sale that adjoins theirs at a higher cost then makes sense from a pure valuation point of view. Low supply of land for sale could A) prevent price discovery as land that has likely fallen in value on paper doesn't trade or B) there could be enough capital that wants to buy land due to choices that have already been made (funds raised, capital allocation by investors, targets by farm operators... who knows) that they pay a high price. However, given declining credit conditions, rising interest rates and weak repayment rates, it wouldn't take many forced sales to incrase the supply of land--by sellers who have to take a weak and/or market price. The data presented here is quite negative on the outlook for land values: https://durangoherald.com/articles/114965-more-farmers-are-having-trouble-making-loan-payments?wallit_nosession=1 So we have a 75% positive base rate or something like that and extremely bearish set of expert views. I don't have a mathematical basis for my probability but I think the chances of land values increasing over the next 2 quarters of data is low--but not as low as the \"expert consensus\"--and there is plenty of chances that short term movements in the data push Q1 2017 over the mark for Q1 2016."], [691, "2017-01-17T22:57:59Z", [0.36], ""], [11057, "2017-01-17T15:51:40Z", [0.46], ""], [14208, "2017-01-17T06:39:34Z", [0.45], ""], [554, "2017-01-16T08:00:00Z", [0.55], ""], [6303, "2017-01-16T01:46:59Z", [0.51], "According to the general news and GJP consensus."], [3328, "2017-01-15T21:42:47Z", [0.05], ""], [28414, "2017-01-15T21:38:00Z", [0.15], ""], [691, "2017-01-15T21:33:17Z", [0.36], "Crop prices are broadly down or stable, and nothing is happening to goose up land sales in the short term."], [29970, "2017-01-15T21:10:22Z", [0.25], ""], [32590, "2017-01-15T09:07:01Z", [0.35], ""], [31238, "2017-01-14T21:50:10Z", [0.35], "Moving it up as there is a lot of movement toward 50% which makes me less certain.

The depressed prices will cause many farmers to have to sell land and others to give up leases on farmland. Although this environment will lead to many leases changing hands and many farms being put up for sale, I think the lack of capital on hand and access to credit will cause more of those farms for sale that would normally sell to be leased instead of actually selling this year.
