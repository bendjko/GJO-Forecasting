Ginsburg had a tumor that was discovered at an early stage. She was released from a New York City hospital on February 13 and returned to the bench when the Supreme Court went back into session on February 23, 2009. On September 24, 2009, Ginsburg was hospitalized in Washington, DC, for lightheadedness following an outpatient treatment for iron deficiency and was released the following day. On November 26, 2014, she had a stent placed in her right coronary artery after experiencing discomfort while exercising in the Supreme Court gym with her personal trainer. On November 8, 2018, she was hospitalized after fracturing three ribs in a fall in her office at the Supreme Court. A day later, it was reported that Ginsburg had returned to official judicial work after a day of observation.  A CT scan of her ribs following her November 8 fall showed cancerous nodules in her lungs.

In other words, very strong signal that RBG will not cease to be an AJ by 1/1/20. 2) What is forecastible? Mortality rates based on age, gender, supreme court justices, cancer history, etc. Also, rates of retirement, removal from the supreme court, etc. All of these are throwing strong signal that RBG will not cease to be an AJ by 1/1/20. 3) What is unforeseeable and unforecastable? Examples are dies in car crash, fall down stairs and dies from injuries, chokes on food and dies. Commits a Vontae Davis, etc. Nobody can forecast whether such an event will occur in the next 83 days. Possible, but not forecastable, within the boundaries of the question.

The list includes 16 survivors such as opera singer Marilyn Horne, whose vow to live following her 2005 diagnosis Ginsburg admires. But it also names more than 250 public figures who succumbed to the disease. Julie Fleshman, the network's president and CEO, says the three weeks of radiation Ginsburg received at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York is the go-to treatment for small, localized tumors. A more serious form of the cancer would have called for surgery or further treatment, she says.  The justice's first major health scare was colon cancer in 1999.

So, now I think I know a little bit about both of the main types of lung cancer. Squamous cell lung cancer is the more common type of lung cancer, these days.  It is a skin cancer that forms a well-defined tumor.  It is usually curable through surgery, and often there is no need for follow-up radiation or chemo.  Recovery time post-op for non-strenuous activity is measured in days to weeks.  After successful surgery,  the patient is declared cancer-free.  \"Cure\" is declared only after 5 yrs if there has been no recurrence.   Small cell lung cancer causes a less well-defined tumor.  It is usually treated by  chemotherapy, and about 30 radiation treatments which take only a few minutes each day.  Chemo is usually administered on a 21 or 28 day cycle,  with the first day of the cycle involving a lengthy infusion (about 6 hrs), followed by treatments of 1-2 hrs on days 2 & 3, and then another 48 hrs during which the patient is considered toxic  (think of them as being Roundup or bleach in body shape) and will have restricted freedom.   There may be 5, or more, cycles of chemo.   These treatments can cause a dramatic reduction in immunity (low WBC counts) which can take a week or more to reverse, during which time the patient has to be in isolation.   As far as I know, once treatment has begun, it will be about half a year before it may result in the patient being declared \"cancer-free\". The median survival rate for small cell lung cancer is about 15 months.   Prior to embarking on treatment of either type of lung cancer doctors usually do a PET scan to look for metastases to other organs and an MRI to look for a tumor in the brain (which is where lung cancer normally metastasizes to).  They would not declare a patient \"cancer-free\" after treatment for lung cancer if they saw cancer elsewhere in those scans; in fact, they might not have embarked on treatment at all if they had found anything elsewhere. These descriptions of treatment are not precisely duplicated in every situation for every patient, but the point is that with squamous cell lung cancer the treatment is a one-time procedure with a recovery period of under a month, but with small cell lung cancer the treatment is much more debilitating and takes months--like half a year--and frequent periods of isolation and treatment. Nobody is saying which type of lung cancer RBG had, but look at how soon she was back on the bench and how available she has been to the press and public.  I have read that the doctors have declared her \"cancer-free\".  Thus,  I am 99% sure she had a squamous cell lung cancer.   Therefore, I think her odds of dying of lung cancer in the next 6 months are very low:  1%.  Therefore, her survival odds are about \"normal\" for a woman of her age, about 7% per year.  Adjusted for the fact that we're 6 months into the year, makes the base rate about 3%.  However, everything I read says that RBG is very health-conscious and I assume she gets excellent medical care, so I'll reduce her odds by 2/3rds to 1%. Furthermore,  I think her odds of resigning voluntarily are next to nil. What am I missing?

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have a chart of top ten causes of death for people ages 65+: https://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/pdf/10lcid_all_deaths_by_age_group_2010-a.pdf Heart disease is the leading cause, but less likely since she appears to have a personal trainer. Second most likely cause is malignant neoplasms, aka tumor, aka cancer, which she's had numerous encounters with. Respiratory and cerebro-vascular disease are, like heart disease, perhaps less likely since she's not shown these illnesses. The chart doesn't have an \"other\" row but since the 10th most likely cause of death is 1/20th the most likely cause, perhaps we can ignore these.

Scaling 8.7% by the overall weight from the CDC analysis of causes of death gives 6.99% probability of dying this year. Right now there are seven months left in the year. Assuming all days are equally likely to result in death, we can scale 7% probability of dying this year with 7/12, giving 4.08%. Apparently she's very unlikely to quit just because of her health, since that'd give the current president another appointment. The question leaves open the possibility that she gets promoted to chief justice but Justice Roberts would have to be evicted and nobody else but her appointed, giving that negligible probability.

Will she die? - Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 86 years old. According to the US Government's Social Security actuarial life tables (https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html), the Death Probability (that is, the chances that an individual will die within the next year) is 0.082465, or roughly 8.2%, for an 86 year old female in the US. We can expect that due to her lifelong elevated socioeconomic status, healthy lifestyle, and access to the highest level of healthcare, the percent probability of her death in 2019 would actually be lower than this.  However, Ginsburg's medical history suggests she is at greater risk of dying of cancer. After the cancerous lesions were removed from her lungs in December 2018, her doctors have stated that there is an 80% chance of being cancer-free five years out (in other words, a 20% chance that she will have another recurrence of lung cancer in that time - for this analysis let's assume a flat rate of 4% per year). Also, people who have had cancer once are more likely to get a second unrelated cancer, as Ginsburg herself has (she had pancreatic cancer previously). In sum, we can assess there is a higher chance that Ginsburg will be diagnosed with cancer in 2019 than her cohort. Total chances of dying: 8.2% + 4% = 12.2% Will she retire? - Given Ginsburg's status as one of the 4 liberal justices on the Court, the fact that the last two Supreme Court Justices to be appointed were nominated by a Republican President, and that that President will remain President until at least January 20, 2021, we can assess the likelihood that she will retire while Donald Trump is still be responsible for nominating her replacement as 0%. This may change if Trump wins a second term, but that wouldn't happen until November 2020. Will she retire due to debilitating illness? As previously stated, she has had numerous health scares from cancers and falls and also has had multiple surgeries (https://www.vox.com/2018/11/12/18080366/ruth-bader-ginsburg-movie-health). While these have yet to adversely impact her ability to serve on the Supreme Court, the chances that they will do so only increases with time. However, it is assumed from past experience that cancer and falls will either be fatal or recoverable in a way as to not impact her ability to continue on on the Court, at least until the end of the year. Two age-related illnesses that may impact her ability to serve as a Justice are stroke and dementia. Due to her advanced age, she is at risk of stroke (assumed to be roughly 15% - https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/74/3/317). Additionally, her chances of developing dementia are estimated to be 1 in 6, or about 17% (https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/sites/default/files/pdf/factsheet_risk_factors_for_dementia.pdf), however it is unlikely that dementia would have a fast enough onset to cause her to retire in just the remainder of this year.  Adding up the probabilities of debilitating illness: 15% (stroke) + 5% (dementia, reduced to account for lower likelihood of fast onset) = 20% In total: Est. probability of death (12.2%) + certain probability of voluntary retirement (0%) + Est. probability of debilitating illness (20%) = 32.2% that Ruth Bader Ginsburg ceases to be a Supreme Court Justice by 1 January 2020."], [1333, "2019-05-09T18:13:02Z", [0.09], ""], [73121, "2019-05-09T18:02:38Z", [0.15], ""], [73121, "2019-05-09T17:55:52Z", [0.25], "The probability of her stepping down is very low as she will wait until after the presidential election in hopes of a democratic president.

In fact, she is far from the first justice to remain on the bench at a more advanced age. Furthermore, her recovery from surgery took no longer then was expected by medical professionals, suggesting that it was relatively successful.

I predict this percentage is on the higher side at 15% due to her declining health, where there is probability of forced retirement by doctors. \nOn the other hand, the other reason she would cease to be on the Supreme Court is her death. Generally speaking, the life expectancy for women in the United States is 78 years old; however, the expectancy for affluent, white women rises to 84.3. Currently, RBG is 86, making her above the average life expectancy. In December of 2018, two cancerous nodes were found on RBGs left lung. Net survival of lung cancer for women between 80-99 years old is 7%; however, the average time the cancer lasts after diagnosis is 5 years. If she was diagnosed in December of 2018, this would put the average date of death at December of 2023 which is way beyond January 2020. RBG is likely to have the highest quality of care in the country given her position and income level, perhaps giving her more years and making death less likely. On the contrary, her age makes other causes of death that are unexpected more likely. From all of these statistics, I would predict that RBG dying before 1 of January 2020 is unlikely with an average of 25%.  When we average the 15% probability of retirement and 25% probability of death, this leaves a 20% probability of Ruth Bader Ginsburg ceasing to be an Associate Justice of the US Supreme Court before January 1, 2020.

RBG could not be an associate justice on Jan. 1, 2020 because she: 1. dies (of natural causes or by other means); 2. retires/leaves office (either voluntarily; due to physical/mental incapacity; impeached); 3. becomes the Chief Justice.  Scenario 1: What's the likelihood of RBG dying before Jan. 1, 2020? RBG is current 86 years old. The life expectancy of a woman at her age is 6.43 years. Therefore, I can expect her to live to 92.43 years old, which would mean that she'd be alive on Jan 1, 2020. The probability of her death is 0.084033 (according to the Social Security actuarial table), but we have some other factors to consider. Her mother died of cancer at the age of 48 (1902-1950); her father died at 71 (1896-1968)--his cause of death is unclear. Some studies indicate that children of people who had cancer have a higher likelihood of also having cancer (https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/causes-of-cancer/inherited-cancer-genes-and-increased-cancer-risk/family-history-and-inherited-cancer-genes). However, since I don't know the type of cancer her mother died from, it's difficult to account for it. We also know that she had a tumor removed successfully in 2018 (with a 86% recovery rate), so we can also assume that she has access to good health care and is taking some proactive measures in regards to her health. Her race and educational status also play a role. Research also indicates that white women with higher educational attainment have a lower risk of mortality (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4435622/)--mortality was 38% higher in women 65-84 with 9-11 years of school compared with those who had 17 or more years. In consideration of these elements, it seems not very likely that she'll die by natural causes before Jan. 1, 2020. Based on the Social Security table, the probability is 0.084033 (8.4033%), leaving a 91.6% chance that she'll still be alive.  Then there's the question of death by other means. There has only been one known attempt to assassinate a Justice, and it was unsuccessful. So let's set that chance at very, very low.  Scenario 2: what's the likelihood of her retiring/being removed from office before Jan. 1, 2020?  RBG has served on the Supreme Court since 1993, a 26 year term. Justices appointed between 1966 and the present have served an average of 24 years (not counting current Justices--https://www.vox.com/2016/2/17/11032182/pope-president-and-justice-ages). The longest-serving Justice was 36 years and 7 months (there have been 113 Justices, so 1/113th have served 36 years). Of the living Justices who retired: Justice Stevens (35 years); O'Connor (25 years); Kennedy (30 years); Souter (19 years)--average of 27.75 years. So she's slightly above the average term but slightly below the number of years of retired living Associate Justices. If she will stay in her position for the average of retired living Justices, that would put her in office past Jan. 1, 2020.  On the question of being impeached: only one Justice has ever been impeached by the House (Justice Chase). The Democrats will control the House until at least Jan. 1, 2020, so there's very small chance they would impeach her. Even Chase, who was awful, wasn't removed after trial in the Senate. So let's set that chance very, very low, too.  Maybe we should add in a very low chance of some radically unexpected possibility: a military coup that eliminates the Supreme Court; a national emergency where the President dissolves the Court; a Constitutional amendment goes through some kind of hyper-political drive and abolishes the Court. Who knows. Wacky times.  Scenario 3: What's the likelihood of RBG being made Chief Justice?  5 of the 17 Chief Justices served as Associate Justices before becoming Chief, so .294117 probability. However, Chief Justice Roberts would have to either die, retire, or be removed from office for the spot to open up. He has only been on the Court for 14 years, and he is relatively young (64). So either of those events happening seems very unlikely. He has 18.53 expected remaining years and a 0.014979 probability of dying. He's well below the average term for a modern Justice to retire, and since the Senate is controlled by Republicans, it seems unlikely that he'd be impeached by the House and convicted by the Senate. So let's throw in another very low chance of this happening.  Therefore, the most likely event would be RBG's retirement, either voluntarily or due to incapacity. Based on the above figures, let's call it a 19.8% chance of one of the events happening. But it has been a really, really long time since I've taken a math class. I probably have oversimplified the last step. The last scenario should be given less weight because of how unlikely it seems. So I'll bring the number down to 17% to try and account for that .  As for some of the other estimates that involved her desire to stay on the Court as long as possible: I don't think we can reliably factor in her determination to stay in office until the next Presidential term since she would not have any choice at all about her own retirement (mental/physical incapacity) or death (natural or otherwise).

I naturally hope my (low) estimate is not unpleasantly surprised) Rationale very similar to @Emil, but fractionally below him as: 1) I wouldn't discount much from the base-rate given the known medical conditions: the 'median 85 year old' on the life table would also likely have significant pre-existing conditions, so its not clear wrt comorbidities RBG is in on the left tail of the reference class: (note e.g. the disease specific mortality curves for bowel and pancreatic Ca are pretty flat 10+ years out, so probably aren't contributing much risk). 2) I *would* give a substantial-ish boost for affluence, social class, and education. All are recognised as (interlinked, but independently contributing statistically if not causally) protective factors for health and survival both generally and from the vast bulk of diseases individually. One example to give an impression of their size is highest versus lowest (e.g.) income quartile give an ~8 year life expectancy spread in the US (and also some evidence of compression of morbidity, such that richer people spend less lifespan in ill-health). So RBG is definitely on the right tail of the life-table reference class.  3) I agree with better medical care etc (although this would be partly included in the above consideration). So I'd start at ~8, and on balance go down to ~5.5 guesstimating these considerations (this implies HR~ 0.7 baserate, which is broadly concordant with other background data such as cancer survival when comparing highest versus approximant median bands for social class etc.) Bluntly, this is an estimate of 'dying on the bench', but there are other disjunctions to account for. Similar to Emil, I'd add ~3-4 percent for these, which would be mostly be ill-health. 85 and v. demanding job on one hand (commonsensically, no one would be shocked if someone retired in their mid eighties); political motivation to stay on and right tail fitness-for-age on the other. I find it hard to more than guestimate here as these things would not be statistically independent, but also there's lots of 'pricing in'/double counting issues. [Forgive lack of citations - if time permits I'll go back to double check my work. FWIW I used to work as a public health physician]. Aside: I would basically ignore (/price into existing considerations) that she did not attend hearings this week, as this still puts one well within (as I understand) typical recovery times for the operation she underwent. I'd start going up if this absence stretched into next month (or other worrying signals).

Therefore in forecasting this question, we are dealing with the probability of her death within in a year.\nThere are two sets of mortality statistics: one for the general population and another one for a person with a certain disease.\nAccording to the actuarial table, the mortality rate (the probability of dying within one year) for a 85-years old (Ginsburg\u2019s age) female is 7.5%.  (https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html).  This is our baseline number.\nHowever since Ginsburg has had several bouts of cancer.  Survival rates for cancer patients have to be taken into consideration.  Ginsburg recovered from the first two bouts of cancer (colon cancer in 1999 and pancreatic cancer in 2009), most likely due to their early detection.  Their effects on her current health can be considered to be negligible.  \nIn November 2018, cancerous nodules were found in her lungs.  These nodules are considered to be in early stages of lung cancer.  I don\u2019t know what stage the cancer is, but most likely Stages 1 or 2.  \nThe one-year survival rate for lung cancer patients is hard to come by.  But tables shown in the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (https://www.seattlecca.org/diseases/lung-cancer/lung-cancer-overview/survival-rates) indicates that the one-year survival rates for Stage 1 and Stage 2 lung cancer are 87.5 and 82.5%, respectively for the Alliance patients.  The Stage 1 and 2 survival rates are lower in other treatment centers (80% and 65%, respectively).  I assume that Ginsburg will be under excellent care.  I will use the better survival rate of 85% for the two stages of lung cancer (average between 87.5 and 82.5%).\n This means there is a death rate of 15% (100-85) for an early stage cancer patient.

Acturial data suggests she has a 7% change of dying this year, she has access to better healthcare than most at her age, but the has had health problems and fell last November (third since 2012), before having surgery to remove tumours in her lungs in December. As @Anneinak has said, the type of cancer she had does make a difference to her life expectancy, and people who have that kind of cancer can live a very long time, but she like many other people her age has mounting health problems and although she intends to stay on the court as long as she can, hiring another four law clerks until 2020, I think that she may be forced because of her health to step down, despite not wanting to because of the current president.

So for that reason, I'm down from 100% to 60%. In the end, if Ginsburg is incapacitated, it may not make any difference, because there is no prescribed number of Supreme Court Justices. So I wonder what the procedure would be if Justice Ginsburg were to be bedridden, extremely weak, but fully conscious and lucid when she's awake. Unable, however, to attend sessions, and hear arguments, or even watch them streamed in real time without weakening to a point where she can't meaningfully participate. In that case, would her vote on any given suit still count - or even be solicited. Moreover, could Trump get away with appointing a tenth justice who could attend to the duties required, and whose vote would count? After all, it wouldn't be illegal or unconstitutional - although it would be a radical departure from tradition and from what would widely be considered acceptable behavior. But then, we've seen a lot of departures from tradition and acceptable behavior over the years. Anyway, getting back to the question: I think forecasters are right that she will not resign for health reasons. If Trump can do an end-run around her refusal to resign, he will. And I think that Ginsburg's health may be more compromised than we are led to believe. If we hear some details about her overall condition, I may change my mind.
