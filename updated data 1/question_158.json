I now believe (but wouldn\u2019t be surprised if EWP made a clarification that contradicted this) that the period related to any specific question starts when the question is introduced and runs through the end of CY 2016.

A narrow interpretation is that whatever government (\u201cin\u201d tribe) forces there are target only a specific subset of the population. Then there is a broader interpretation that any significant deaths that are not combat related or otherwise proscribed would count (in the sense that those targeted are \u201coutsiders\u201d in some sense).

On the 12th, however, a court cleared Kabila to remain in power if the election were delayed.

Burundi crisis - I increase by 2% given history of refugee crises causing wars in DRC. THEN, there was also a slaugher in the Kivu region of 40-50 people.  Since this tally counts towards  the definition of \"mass killing\" as I understand it in this question, then it by definition increases the probability of hitting that 500 #. http://www.christiantoday.com/article/drc.worship.leader.and.deacon.among.9.people.killed.by.islamist.militants/85929.htm\nAlso increase by 2.5% (i could be more accurate here if I knew the current fully tally of civilian killings this year.

Unanimously adopting resolution 2277 (2016) under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Council took note of the Secretary-General\u2019s recommendation to reduce MONUSCO\u2019s force level by 1,700 troops, taking into account the progress made in developing an exit strategy and in addressing the threat posed by armed groups. Recalling the 2,000-troop reduction endorsed in resolution 2211 (2015), the Council reaffirmed its intention to make that downsizing permanent through a revised troop ceiling, and requested that the Secretary-General report back on that specific issue.  It reiterated that any future reconfigurations of MONUSCO and its mandate should be determined in consultation with the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, based on the evolution of the situation on the ground. The Council decided that MONUSCO\u2019s strategic priorities would contribute to the protection of civilians from violence \u2014 including gender-based violence and violence against children \u2014 and stabilization, including by supporting the creation of an environment conducive to peaceful, credible and timely elections.  It requested that the Mission consider child protection and gender considerations as cross-cutting issues across its mandate, and that the Secretary-General take necessary measures to ensure MONUSCO\u2019s full compliance with the United Nations zero-tolerance policy on sexual exploitation and abuse.  The Council urged troop-and police-contributing countries to take preventive actions and ensure full accountability in cases of such conduct involving their personnel. By other terms, the Council stressed that MONUSCO\u2019s exit should be \u201cgradual and progressive\u201d and tied to targets jointly developed with the Government.  Specifically, it reiterated the need for a clear exit strategy for the Intervention Brigade \u2014 which, according to the text, had been extended on an exceptional basis, without creating a precedent or prejudice to the agreed principles of peacekeeping \u2014 including through progress in ending the threat posed by armed groups.

Last couple of years seem to be getting (relatively) better. Some rebel groups have turned in their guns in exchange for political cooperation. Kabila has been in power since the end of the 2nd Congolese civil war, and has been consolidating his power vis-a-vis governor elections. This has will likely strengthen his hold on security forces, which could discourage new rebel groups from intervening. Although it's hard to tell how solid the security forces are, as Congo strongmen have historically maintained power through a divide and conquer strategy that weakens state institutions, including security forces. I think the question may be a bit ambiguous.  \"New mass killing\" episode is classified as over 1,000 civilian deaths over a 1 year period.  Does that mean 1 year period starting Jan 1 2016, or Jan 1 2017? When would the decision be made?  Would the 550 civilians killed in the Beni massacres count? http://allafrica.com/stories/201603280235.html I think the major trigger will be whether or not Kabila attempts to secure a 3rd term for himself, which he is constitutionally not allowed to do but hasn't stopped other \"progressive\" minded African leaders like Paul Kagame in recent years. We don't know how that'll play out in DRC in Oct-Nov. There may very well be massacres, but a single event where 1,000 people are killed would require a very rapid escalation of events, beyond mass protests that could easily result from anti-Kabila sentiment, and it seems like the trend of rebel groups have been to put guns down last couple of years rather than pick them up.  Not to mention that organizing rebel groups is not an instantaneous process.  For that reason I'm rating this somewhat low, since trigger events to any sort of massive civil strife on the order witnesses in the 2 Congolese civil wars would likely occur towards the end of this year. However, I don't fully understand in what time period (1 year starting when?) that 1,000 tally would be counted.
