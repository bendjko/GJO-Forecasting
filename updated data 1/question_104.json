Similarity to past top 3 TOTY awards would seem to eliminate a few of the candidates from even placing (in my mind) (loom) i-loom (2014 WINNER: Rainbow Loom\u00ae by Choon\u2019s Design LLC), (Cruis) Flipsies\u2122 Sandy's House & Ocean Cruiser (2013 WINNER: LEGO\u00ae Friends by The LEGO Group), (MiP) MiPosaur (2015 WINNER: ZOOMER DINO\u2122 by SPIN MASTER). (Maze) Laser Maze\u2122 Jr. looks very cool and innovative, but it's \"laser\" tech seems out of sync with the climate of the popular imagination to be the winner; it's likely to be an enthusiasts favorite, and despite it's likely appeal in Russia (based on \"Science\" and \"Construction\" attributes that seem to drive that market), Russia doesn't seem to be predicted as a large toy growth market. (Yes I found that same slideshare Euromonitor report that many of you probably did--if only there were more time lol) 3 Toys stood out to me:  3rd Choice:\n(Jedi) Star Wars Science - Jedi Force Levitator which undoubtedly gets a big boost by the recent box office success of Star Wars, including in a key future global toy growth market, China. That said, the video describing the tech behind it made me think it's going to be more of an enthusiasts thing; after watching kids play with it, the play experience seems a bit wonky and \"the force\" is a pretty abstract selling point, and the likeness to the light-saber (the way it is used in the movies) is limited. Furthermore, the niche oddity of this toy is likely one of the many reasons it was not part of the large integrated marketing push promoting things like BB-8 App-Enabled Droid by Sphero - Star Wars: The Force Awakens which closely resembles the Droid in the new film.  Made by Uncle Milton only featured on the Star Wars \"Science\" niche pages, and not promoted or sold on Disney Star Wars page, or apparently visible on the Disney Star Wars products page (a search for \"Star Wars Levitator\" yielded nothing). Therefore, I discount the benefit of Disney marketing and promotions and Star Wars fame for this product.  2nd Choice:\n(Makey) Makey Makey Classic I like because of its USB interoperability, the intuitiveness of play (invention!), and because it reminds me of the massive historical successes of video games that have incredibly low system requirements and good playability, and how it offers at least the possibility of introducing users to a wider online community. It's also really a platform, it's infinite possibilities make this a versatile \"toy\" or \"tool\" that can keep on giving as well as be a good entry point into circuitry, programming, and invention. \"Makey Makey Classic\" search on Youtube gives 616 results, many of which are weird inventions people have made, it's quite impressive a social media showing especially considering that a \"Star Wars Levitator\" Youtube search gives 1200 results, most of which are official promos and other unrelated \"Star Wars\" search results--it seems like the oddity of the \"Makey Makey Classic\" name means that it has already captured people's imagination and has earned it's results organically vs. paid hits from Disney on the levitator. This is the toy that should win, but I don't think it will. It's dependent on a computer ($$$ & knowledge of other software) and the $50 price tag versus the low-budget marketing that seems to rely on a few gimmicky examples (bananas)  and more on the inventor's MIT cachet rather than really thinking about how it fits into user experiences; people seeing the promo, might not understand why this thing is the coolest of the toys on the list, and think $50 is a bit too much for a bananna piano. Makey Makey may take a long time to organically grow and achieve it's full potential, there's too much uncertainty in the future to say it's a winner.  In addition to being a good gateway to the Arduino hobbyist culture, as well as programming, and invention in general, I like this because it's likely to be something parents would do with their kids, which leads me to my next top choice.  First Choice:\n(G15) Meccanoid G15 has a high price-point, but seems to work well across many dimensions. It's a science and technology based toy that seems like a platform (changeability/ versatility of use, and cross/up  selling opportunities for the company) for launching kids and their parents into the world of robotics, machine language, programming etc. Furthermore, the time seems right considering the current \"sci-fi\"obsession with artificial intelligence and robotics that is evidenced across many aspects of popular culture. The relatively mature marketing and robust distribution (e.g. Toys R Us, Walmart, Amazon) gives examples of how this toy fits into a home discovery and invention experience, and the toy is readily available in the channel. The toy has already made a large social impact as is evidenced by the over 4000 Youtube video search results, many of which are user generated content. This toy, if marketed poorly, could appear to be a niche-nerd market thing, but they've done a good job of integrating into lifestyles and play experiences. Things that are a platform for discovery need to provide surprises, but need predictable formats for discovery (this toy feels like a toy, not an arduino board with a lot of wires, it's easy to imagine getting into this play experience). The Makey Makey seems too far out ahead of the market, The Meccanoid G15 seems like it fits in the current market and can grow it/ take it forward. Other macro factors (from the Euromonitor report) \"Construction and Dolls to give growth in absolute terms\" make a compelling case for this toy as a winner.   Since the question asks to pick a winner, I'm essentially putting most of eggs in one basket, feels a bit more likely gambling, I'm guessing this is a novice mistake; I identified other dimensions of analysis that I initially wanted to follow up on (below), but with the deadline approaching I am just doing this in one evening.  Thanks for a question that seems like a playful entry-point to learn something about forecasting that I won't care too much about how off I am :-) If I had more time I would have considered the following more deeply:\n-Targetable market, expected penetration (existing nerds, cross-over users (ala wii), existing mainstream toy base)\n-Play-style shift required\n-Definition of innovation\n-Where does toy exist on adoption curve in relevant tech/market\n-Intuitiveness\n-Price point & accessibility (What do you get for the price? items + access to community + introductory knowledge)\n-How long does the experience last (materials, play-experience, post-purchase engagement, communities)\n-Applications (play/productivity)\n-In line with future/ capture public imagination\n-Likelyhood of purchase/ purchase ocassions\n-TOTY's industry role (identify creativity re: toys--impact, innovation, change and guide market, change play behavior, change perspectives on (e.g. robots, AI) 2/7/16 Forecasts For Top 3 Picks\n1) Meccanoid G15 85%\n2) Makey Makey Classic 5%\n3) Jedi Force Levitator 5% 2/8/16 Updates\n@Doudtful Thanks for suggesting having a look at Amazon.com user ratings; 4.5 Stars is a good rating for the Makey Makey, however it's across a confirmed buyer base of 169 versus 4 Stars for Meccanoid G15 with confirmed buyer base of 209; this is itself doesn't seem very compelling, however the distribution of 5 star tier ratings is definitely higher for Makey Makey, as you mention, so it might be worth adjusting my forecast. At this point, to get some context on the Amazon data, I think it's worth considering how much weight to give to consumer feedback, and how long each product has been on the market.  To put these results in perspective and to get a view on organic desire in the market for the products I tried to find the launch dates for each toy to see how long they have been up for sale; I used Google Adwords keyword searches to see when people first started searching for each toy: Meccanoid G15 searches start to pick up July, which appears to be the launch date (I also found a Barnes & Noble product listing dated 7/13/15) so let's say that it became available in July 2015; Google Adwords shows \"Meccanoid G15\" searches at July 110, August 590, Sept 1000, Oct 3600, Nov 14,800, and Dec. 27100 with average monthly at 3600 searches. What seems impressive about this is the early geometric growth so soon after launch, however this seems discounted by the fact that Dec is Christmas and that I suspect all toys get a boost here; we would really need to see Jan and Feb 2016 data for a better perspective. Makey Makey's Google Adwords search data seems quite impressive: from January 2015 all the way through October there has been steady search volume of at least 12,000 and several months with up to 14K, then in November 30K searches and December 40K searches; based solely on the Google Adwords searches it seems Makey Makey has really taken hold of the market curiosity in a lasting way.  The next question is, how does this translate into sales figures, and how much do sales figures impact on TOTY's criteria for innovation. The consistent market buzz for Makey Makey seems less impressive against the Amazon.com data considering that it has been available, most likely since before January 2015, with only 169 sold in that time (however, it is entirely possible that the Amazon listing was renewed at some point and this is not total Amazon data); furthermore, if you look at the earliest date of the Amazon reviews for the Makey Makey, they go back to November 2012, which makes this toy's total sold on Amazon figure seem really unimpressive (169 over 3 years). It is very possible that most of the Makey Makey's have been sold on their direct sales website or other channels, so it's hard to know how heavily to weight the Amazon information. The Meccanoid Google Adwords search data for just a few months is quite compelling in showing a toy with exponentially growing interest online, but again it launched just before Christmas so hard to say without Jan/Feb data. Since the Meccanoid G15 keyword data very likely includes searches for Meccanoid G15 KS, the big-brother toy ( about 2.5 times as expensive as the G15), so we could discount that the G15 alone is driving this online interest alone, making it's Google data less impressive--however, from this perspective, if we add the Amazon sales totals for both G15 (209) and G15 KS (159) we might then say, with less impressive search showing, these toys are still doing better in 3-4 months than Makey Makey has done in over 3 years.  After checking TOTY competition rules, the final voting must be completed by January 15th, so the judges don't have much more data than we are talking about here.  The Adwords search made me curious, if launched in 2012, why hasn't Makey Makey been nominated or awarded yet--my guess is that it probably has, but perhaps the judges felt this toy needed a bit longer to reach market maturity, it's so unique. For comparison I looked at search results for \"Star Wars bb-8\" the massively marketed robot, not very impressive results, but then changed keywords to various permutations of \"force awakens robot/droid/bb-8\" and \"star wars robot/droid/bb-8\"  to and \"star wars droid\" shows spiking searches in Dec. up to 40K, on the level of Makey Makey; considering the Star wars search term is not necessarily specific enough to isolate searches for that toy, it seems that Makey Makey, may be having it's mainstream breakthrough now--this could be it's year. I'm gonna adjust my estimate.   2/8/16\n1) Meccanoid G15 80%\n2) Makey Makey 10%\n3) Star Wars Levitator 6%* Due to recent media coverage citing NDP stats on Star Wars toy sales, I'm upping the marketing \"draft\" benefit for anything related to Star Wars, but not by much, because it is uncertain how much sales figures alone are part of this decision (certainly they at least demonstrate the toy is out there and being used). 2/10/16 Research / No Forecast Update Frustrated because I feel that the Makey Makey should be the winner based on the limited perspectives I've been able to research in 4 days; another compelling argument for the Makey Makey is the over 40K Youtube videos, many user-generated content; basically, I feel the decision comes down to whether or not the award giver HAS THE ABILITY to properly appreciate this toy's market impact. Going to focus some last minute research on whether the award giving mechanism has enough permeability and judgment to be able to appreciate the Makey Makey.  Based on past winners of innovative toy and the other nominees back through 2012, none have been as unorthodox a toy as the Makey Makey. Makey Makey being just nominated this year, says something.  In terms of the TOTY association's connection to the market, the NOMINATION process seems well connected to the real-world toy industry and the people you would expect to be able to appreciate the nuance of the Makey Makey and the clear social impact, namely children, parents, journalists/bloggers, inventors, academics, mommys and teachers.  However, the DECISION process for winners is weighted 60% in favor of RETAILERS (30%) and MEMBERS OF THE TOY INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION (30%) versus  40% for most of those people mentioned in the nomination process.

Looking at G15 and Makey Makey from the \"Play Value\" dimensions below, I think both do well; Makey Makey would seem to do better in the longevity aspect of play value. The one area where Makey Makey might suffer based on a play value analysis is \"self-directed play\" that is, it may be easy enough to rig the USB interface to work with one set of items, but more difficult with others, and it is quite easy to see that a parent's involvement might be absolutely required to get some things working. There is no doubt about the brilliance of this device, however, it might breach the boundary of toy used by these award givers, towards productivity tool.  In terms of \"play value\" that is integrated into the toy itself, and becomes self-evident or discoverable to a child user during play, I think the G15 still presents a more understandable choice for the industry gatekeeper status quo. Although I think the Makey Makey is brilliant, I'm not going to update my forecast, perhaps I'm not giving the 60% weight industry incumbent voters enough credit on vision.  I have a feeling that just nominating Makey Makey this year might be enough of a statement about innovation for them.  Play value\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nPlay value is the essential value of a toy or game for play. The term is frequently employed in the field of child development and playwork for the assessment of toys, games, equipment and spaces. When they are fun and engaging, playthings and spaces are said to have play value; those that are quickly discarded or are considered uninteresting do not. In short, objects of play must be compelling and encourage the child's involvement in order to have true play value. Play value has been defined as 'how much play can you get out of something'.[1] Classic toys are examples of toys with true play value as they continue to provide new discoveries and adventures in each subsequent session of play.[2] Contents  [hide] \n1\tAssessment of play value in the selection of toys and games\n2\tMultiple uses\n3\tSelf-directed play\n4\tAppeal to more than one age or stage of development\n5\tInverse relationship with linkage to TV, movies and video games\n6\tComplement or supplement other play activities\n7\tStay with children as they develop\n8\tPromote respectful interaction\n9\tUseful for further learning\n10\tReferences\n11\tSee also\nAssessment of play value in the selection of toys and games[edit]\nThe selection of toys and games has long been a concern to parents and educators. Many fail to sufficiently engage children. Stevanne Auerbach emphasizes that products should last as long as possible and have many different and long lasting uses. Good examples of toys with high play value are blocks, construction toys and yo-yos. The toy should have clear instructions so the parent and child are guided to its best use by the designer and manufacturer.[3] In playwork terms it is the child who determines the play value of an object rather than adults or instruction manuals Multiple uses[edit]\nToys tend to have high play value when they may be used, engaged and employed in manifold ways. A good example is Lego bricks which may be assembled and connected in myriad ways to make cars, trucks, planes, trains, etc. Another good example is polymer clay which may be used for sculpting hand-shaped items, such as beads, jewelry, and charms. Self-directed play[edit]\nChildren need to be in charge of their own play activity. According to PBS' The Whole Child Web site when adults plan the play activity and structure the outcome of playtime it is far less effective than if children have the freedom to form their own ideas, practice skills and use playthings at their own speed. Cardboard box toys are an example of playthings which allow children to use their own imaginations.[4] Appeal to more than one age or stage of development[edit]\nPlayability is a word that when applied to games has a similar meaning to play value. Those games with strong playability appeal to more than one age or stage of development. For example, Monopoly and Risk are two games that appeal to a wide range of ages, though generally not to very young children. Similarly, toys that appeal to more than one age or stage tend to have higher play value. Inverse relationship with linkage to TV, movies and video games[edit]\nAuthors Nancy Carlsson-Paige & Diane Levin[5] note that play value in toys can be seen as inversely related to their degree of linkage with TV, movies and video games. For example, G.I. Joe, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Power Rangers are all examples of toys that have cross-feeds with television shows that have violent themes. Similarly, Godzilla, Small Soldiers, Spawn, Jurassic Park and Starship Troopers toys are marketed to children 4 and up. Complement or supplement other play activities[edit]\nComputer games or electronic toys are examples of toys that can complement or supplement other play activities. According to author Cathrine Neilsen-Hewett,[6] while often stimulating, engaging and fun, these toys should never become a substitute for traditional play activities such as drawing, pretending, or block building. Instead, electronic games are best thought of as adding to or reinforcing other kinds of play, and are not a suitable replacement for parental interaction and attention. @Doudtful some more input in case you're interested.  2/10/16 Odds and Ends Ok my issue with bumping Makey Makey chance of winning higher is not an issue with Makey Makey, but rather relates to my understanding of the TOTY judges perspective; especially considering that 60% final decision weighting is given to Retailers (30%) and organization members (30%). The awesomeness of Makey Makey is not in question, just whether the judges have the ability to appreciate it and whether it fits with their industry role agenda.  Unable to find sales figures for any of the toys specifically, I'm sort of triangulating the larger markets they might appeal to, and using each categories growth trend as a potential insight into TOTY's thinking on where the market is going.  http://www.toyassociation.org/tia/industry_facts/salesdata/industryfacts/sales_data/sales_data.aspx?hkey=6381a73a-ce46-4caf-8bc1-72b99567df1e#.VrvwPVgrLmE Judging by relevant categories to Meccanoid G15, this toy has cross-over appeal in at least 4 categories (Building Sets, Dolls, Youth Electronics, and maybe Action Figures) that compose over 34% of the existing 19.45 BN USD market; 3 of these categories, with the exclusion of Youth Electronics with negative growth 2014/15, have demonstrated market leading high YOY growth for the past two years.  Already large and rapidly growing markets are good pockets to be in for the longevity of the toy market.  Makey Makey most relevant categories being Youth Electronics and perhaps Other Toys only over 8% of the same market in two categories that had negative growth either 2013-14 or 2014-15. The universal appeal of the Makey Makey might mean that these categories are totally irrelevant because it is, as we speak, redefining the toy industry categories\u2014this is a very tough claim to bolster in media res.  Curious to see if either toy has won awards up to now, I found that Mecanno G15 \u2013KS (the big brother toy) won an innovation award at CES 2015 in January. \nhttp://lastgadgetstanding.com/2015-recap/\nhttps://globenewswire.com/news-release/2015/01/09/696358/10114914/en/Meccanoid-G15-KS-wows-the-crowd-takes-home-top-prize-at-Living-in-Digital-Times-Last-Gadget-Standing-Showdown-at-2015-International-CES-R.html\nAt CES, Meccanoid was also awarded the Geek Beat TV Robotics award as the editor's top pick in the robotics category. Off of TOTY main webpage under latest headlines is a press release regarding \u2018smart connected play\u2019 where SPIN MASTER the owner of Meccano the maker of the Meccanno G15 is a speaker; this demonstrates that SPIN MASTER is dialoguing with the industry and is respected as a thought-leader which speaks to the toys innovation claim. \nhttp://www.toyassociation.org/PressRoom2/News/2016_News/Digital%20Kids_Conference_To_Provide_Smart_Connected_Play_Insight_and_Advantages.aspx#.Vrv0nlgrLmE I searched for relevant media coverage or talks by the makers of Makey Makey at Joylabz, Eric Rosenbaum and Jay Silver\nJay Silver on Ted.com\nhttps://www.ted.com/talks/jay_silver_hack_a_banana_make_a_keyboard?language=en\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLLOsCSzuBY\nJay Silver speaker at makercon\nhttp://makercon.com/new-york-2015/speakers/\nCNN\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2013/04/05/tech/innovation/jay-silver-makey/\nThey both seem to be getting the love of the tech startup crowd; less industry sponsored events etc. Relevant media coverage or talks by Spin Master owner of Meccano maker of Mecanoid G15\nBen Varadi, executive vice president and chief creative officer for Spin Master\nhttp://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2474738,00.asp\nAt CES\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZohGXwOtM_E\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/11356944/DRAFT-The-Meccanoid-a-build-your-own-robot-for-kids-unveiled-today.html\nRobots & Baby Learning re: research Meccanoid development based on\nhttp://www.popsci.com/robots-could-learn-same-way-babies-do Although Makey Makey marketing efforts were initially very organic and guerilla, including some minor snafus with post Kickstarter production ( Jay Silver spoke about early on contacting people who submitted oddball content and supplying them with more product for their weird inventions). Eventually, they hired Merge Design & Interactive to revamp their product packaging (as well as some other notable innovations) to make it more Target and Walmart friendly; see case study http://www.mergeworld.com/Our-Work/Makey-Makey. It is unclear whether they are managing any ongoing campaign for Joylabz. Still needing more convincing that Makey Makey is the industries salvation I went looking for articles that articulate the toy industries dilemma and predictions for what will save it. Found this Economist article http://www.economist.com/blogs/schumpeter/2013/09/toy-industry. Here are some excerpts and my analysis of how Makey Makey and G15 stack up to these industry directional forecasts.  \u201cStandalone toys lack scale and versatility. Franchises that span multiple platforms\u2014from cartoons to video games to films to physical toys\u2014are a better bet. Hasbro caught the eye with their recent purchase of a 70% stake in the mobile gaming company, Backflip Studios, for $112 million. On August 7th the company announced a partnership with Ubisoft, a video game developer, aimed at bringing board games to the screen. The future, as Adrienne Appell of America\u2019s Toy Industry Association says, is in \u201ctransmedia storytelling\u201d. Hasbro\u2019s strategy implies that a multi-platform model is now a prerequisite for success.\u201d --Makey Makey: although not a franchise in any traditional sense like Star Wars or GI Joe, Makey Makey is not a standalone product, it can\u2019t, it\u2019s connected to the world to function; and furthermore, because every user\u2019s creation has at least a possibility of being unique (live dog piano, water keyboard, etc.) this product intrinsically meshes well with existing social media sharing environments\u2014it\u2019s a non-ownable amourphous franchise that spans multiple platforms; it\u2019s really a pioneer, something new, I just don\u2019t know whether TOTY has the apparatus to appreciate this. It\u2019s not the kind of franchise with comfortable, predictable, necessarily quantifiable metrics and it exists in an essentially chaotic system; you can imagine the gang at Joylabz having a good laugh at someone rigging up an animal turd keyboard\u2014this is not the kind of creativity that the Barbie brand is comfortable with or capable of recognizing publicly.   --Meccanoid G15 is not standalone either; to my toy novice surprise, Meccano is probably the oldest toy maker in the world. See, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meccano and http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2474738,00.asp  \"Meccano is an iconic global brand with a powerful DNA. It was founded in 1901 and has always been about being culturally relevant and creating toys that enable children and adults to build and stretch their imaginations,\" said Spin Master chief marketing officer Krista DiBerardino. [Spin Master chief marketing officer\u2014wonder if they intended this pun lol]. \nMeccano meets The Economist\u2019s franchise criteria in the traditional sense and could make for a great revitalization of the brand should this toy do well. Back to the article: \u201cToymakers can try to boost growth in other ways. One option is to reach out to new demographics. Big kids are often neglected. In Japan over 20-year-olds made up 23% of total sales in 2011. But only 3.5% of American toy buyers were buying for themselves last year. There is untapped potential here. Three years ago, David Beckham revealed that he had built the Taj Mahal out of Lego; sales of that kit spiked by 633% in just one day. --Makey Makey seems to be trying to do this; I\u2019m not sold on the Makey Makey as an independent use toy for anything but a very precocious 13 year old up to adult; most of the user generated videos online feature adults or kids with adult guidance including school classes with teachers guiding kids on how to rig up and ground their devices, download the MIT open-source \u201cScratch\u201d software etc. It still seems like there is a high degree of not-included knowledge and experience required in order to make Makey Makey makey.  --Meccanoid G15 targeted primarily boys 8+ and girls along and adult supervisors, so still has cross age group appeal, but much more a toy for young people.  Again in summary; I think the Makey Makey is awesome, my impediment for a higher percentage chance for winning is my understanding of TOTY\u2019s organization and perspective and it\u2019s ability to appreciate and measure (or anyone\u2019s ability to measure) the innovative impact of the Makey Makey at this point in time.  Also, in the face of a hard to comprehend toy like Makey Makey it\u2019s easy to gloss over the substantial merits of the Meccanoid G15. \nEconomist article one more time: \u201cSuch strategies, though, are footnotes to the main challenge. Manufacturers must become cleverer at creating high-value, multimedia properties. Toy brands will prosper as entertainment brands. Fostering links with mobile platforms is the first step; commanding attention with compelling content and characters is the next. For the collectors of the future, it will not so much be the toys themselves but the stories they tell that captivate.\u201d For captivating much of my attention these past two evenings I\u2019m giving the Makey Makey a slight chance of winning adjustment, 5%.

Innovative is a different category, but the fact that the toy is aimed primarily at girls, rather than a unisex toy, may limit it in this category. Previous winners have been unisex or unisex leaning toward male. Makey Makey is innovative. It had a Kickstarter campaign. It doesn't seem very accessible, though. Perhaps it's aimed at a niche market or older children, whereas the toys that win in Innovative tend to be simple in concept.  Meccanoid has already won a lot of awards. It seems complicated compared to past winners in this category, but the Toy Industry Association may feel left out, if they don't award the Meccanoid something, and this is the only category in which it's nominated.

Looking in google trend data for each toy, you can see that makey makey and meccanoid have some advantage in these criteria (I could not find relevant search data for the levitator or i-loom, that can be because of the name). My thoughts: Flipsies: Can be the winner on girl toy award, does not look innovative enough, a \"Barbie house\" toy with voice and lights pretty standard. I-loom: The toy is not look popular enough or even developed for American public, a review said that the app use meters. Using i-pad for teaching children how to loom is fun, but not like a robot. Laser Maze: This toy was nominated in this category last year. It lost for the robot of WooWee, same maker of the MiPosaur. The toy sure is clever, that\u2019s why the second time it\u2019s been nominated, but I guess do not draw attention like a robot. Makey Makey and Meccanoid G15:  Both have good popularity and are innovative. My favorites. MiPosaur: WooWee won last year with a robot. This dinosaur is less innovative for me than last year winner and Meccanoid G15, but more commercial. That is why I think he has lower odds than Meccanoid and Makey Makey. Jedi: This toy do not seen to fit with the others years winners.   https://www.google.com.br/trends/explore#q=Flipsies%2C%20MiPosaur%2C%20Makey%20Makey%2C%20Meccanoid%20G15%2C%20Lazer%20Maze&cmpt=q&tz=Etc%2FGMT%2B2\n"], [13853, "2015-12-23T00:13:15Z", [0.28, 0.16, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.29, 0.12], "Robots rule!
