Are all the results possible?  Yes - barely.  This is a single sitting election, where the candidate with the greatest primary vote wins.  No run-offs, no preferences, no need for a majority. Most recent polling I could find is here: http://criterio.hn/2017/09/21/partido-liberal-libre-descalifican-encuesta-cid-gallup/ A result of \"Yes, less than 27%\" seems the least likely.  Last election had 4 significant candidates getting at least 13% of the vote each (all the other candidates combined got <0.7% of the vote).  This election will have 3 significant candidates.  I have real difficulty seeing how the votes could be distributed in a 3-way election such that the winning candidate has 27% (or less!) of the vote.  In short, a JOH with less than 27% is a JOH who loses.  Still, \"stranger things\" and all that ... TOTAL \"Yes, <27%\" = 1%\n(And I would round this to 0% if a fusion between the Alliance and the PL occurs - see below.) Also unlikely is JOH losing the election.  However, having the Liberal Party (PL) join the Libre/PINU Alliance is not inconceivable.  If that happens, the Alliance might not just fuse the two votes, but also appear to have a better chance of winning, and thus pull in further votes that otherwise might be \"wasted\" on smaller parties, or where voters might not have turned up at all.  Highly unlikely though:  perhaps 5% chance of the Alliance expanding and, if so, perhaps a 60% chance of winning the election. If no fusion occurs, then the PL and Alliance will almost certainly lose ... but let's give a token chance (3%?) that one of the Alliance or PL wins _without_ a fusion. TOTAL \"No\" = 6%.  \n(This will fall with time if a fusion between the Alliance and PL does _not_ occur.) For the remaining outcomes (JOH wins with 27.01%+) that leaves 93%.  That seems about right.  But how many votes will he get?  The poll has JOH sitting at 37%.  This same poll (Cid/Gallup) under-counted JOH's result in 2013 by about 10% in its September and October 2013 polls.  That turned neck-and-neck polling into a comfortable 37% to 29% win over the Libre candidate.  That 2013 polling also under-counted the PL by 5% or so, and was reasonably on the mark for the two candidates/parties who now make up the Alliance.  Basically the 15-20% of \"I don't knows\" in the polling defected to JOH or the PL in the election.   I have no reason to suspect that this election will be any more or less free and fair than the previous presidential election in 2013.  (And boy, am I aware of regretting making _that_ assumption for the Venezuelan gubernatorial elections!!) So that puts the middling result somewhere in the upper end of the 38-45% band, which would make 45% more likely than 27-38%.  Also, keeping in mind a 3-way race, it is really tricky to win with only 38% (or less) of the vote.  I'm just going to guess on how narrow or wide the distribution of results are, so ... \"Yes, 27-38%\" = 16%\n\"Yes, 38-45%\" = 42%\n\"Yes, 45%+\" = 35% Of course, all of this is assuming:\na)  The Cid/Gallup poll is as (in)accurate as they were in 2013; this means that further polls might swing my forecasts.\nb)  The vote were happening tomorrow.  I'll have to factor in some fudge factor for volatility, which will count down if nothing drastic happens between now and the end of November.
