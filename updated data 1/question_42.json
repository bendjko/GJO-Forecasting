Although this was subsequently, formally, rescinded, and official Russian military presence in Ukraine continues to be officially denied, these denials are not credible or plausible - there is now substantive evidence, from reputable sources, to the contrary. In a sense the Duma vote seems to serve as a fig-leaf (and given the unanimous nature of the vote, a rubber stamp) for what the Kremlin has in mind. Main counter-argument that might prevent this? Perhaps a strong, aggressive, response from an opponent of Russia with credible military forces warning of even  more severe repercussions that the current Crimea/Ukraine-related sanctions regime it suffers. The current US Administration, despite clear opposition to Russian intentions in Syria (as witnessed at the UN this week), does not appear to favour such overt shows of disagreement. Saudi Arabia? Hardly an ally of Russia - it would be in Russian (and Iranian) interests to be widely perceived as an opponent of the Saudi regime and its allies in Syria.

ISIS can be successfully fought only by ground forces, which Russia is not planning to sent as for now. Therefore, the Russian air force is in place in Syria for two reasons: At first it will block NATO from playing a double game, announcing to bomb ISIS, but in deed destroying Syrian's army assets, similar as it happened in Libya. Secondary, it will support the Syrian and Kurdish forces, which are the only forces fighting ISIS on the ground as for now. After meeting with Obama yesterday, who accepted the necessity to cooperate with the only real ground force in place, which is fighting ISIS - namely the regular Syrian army, it became clear that USA and Russia will coordinate their effort in the air to avoid friendly fire. Russia will use its air force only based on international law, in opposition to NATO. That means, that it will be an approval by UN SC, or a direct request by Assad, which was not publicly announced as for now. My prognosis I have adjusted to the new developments of Obama retracting from his loudly pronounced position to not to cooperate with Assad. It seems that US's policy to use yet another terror organization to seed chaos has worked only to a limited degree - it did destabilize smaller players like Libya, Syria Iraq, but the main geopolitical target Russia is well prepared and much too strong to be dealt with in this manner. China has sent its air carrier to Syria demonstrating its support for Russia. As predicted, the one who wants every thing will become nothing.

The pledge is a boost for Nusra Front against its rival Islamic State, an ultra hardline Sunni Muslim group which has seized territory in Syria and Iraq.

I thought it could all just be posturing, considering how Putin likes to show Russians how strong and powerful Russia/Putin is, which might still be the case. This article https://csis.org/publication/russia-syria-hybrid-political-warfare  does argue this point and is of the opinion that Russia is in a stronger position if it doesn't conduct airstrikes and instead uses the potential abilities of the airbase as a negotiation tool with Western countries in order to keep Assad in power.  Looking at this article http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-34329961 , which pre-dates the one above, Russia's Syria military build up seems to be just for defensive purposes only, as stated by the Russian Defense and the US Secretary of State.

However, it's also in Russia's interest to sell aircraft to Syria http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/22/syria-confirms-receipt-russian-jets-isis   so maybe the airbase is just an expensive way to demonstrate and train Syrian pilots? Maybe eventually it will be Syrian pilots who operate the jets?   Overall, Russian foreign policy isn't exactly the most predictable, so I'm going to give this a high probability for now.

Without a reason for being somewhere in that area and having no guidance, they may end up like the US Marines in Beirut when the Reagan administration had no strategic idea as to why they were there and when Hezbollah blew the Marines up, the Reagan administration called for a retreat. It was then the terrorists knew the administration had no tolerance for spilling blood and it renewed the terrorist\u2019s efforts in the area.  The rest is the historic present.  The Russians want the pro-government party in Syria to survive with or without Mr. Assad. They have a stake in the Mediterranean as it is a strategic route into several areas of the world. The ancients knew it as do the Russians. The Russians may also gain favor from the Iranians since the Obama administration effectively began to slowly move Iran out of Russian influence with the nuclear treaty. It was the Russian and Iranian agreement on building the Iranian nuclear plants that was an important relationship between them.  The Russians might also use their position in Syria to gain in negotiating power from the West in sanctions, or where the West has gained influence around Russia's floating borders and its neighbors, if the Russians pull back or coordinate in Syria with the West.  But if Russia is sucked into the battle, like long wars in Vietnam or Afghanistan, it will take resources away from their fight in Ukraine and Georgia and I do not think the West would mind this burden on Russia. But the Russians have to strike in Syria or goaded into striking before opening negotiations with either the warring parties as a bridge builder and gain favor with Iran and pro-government Assad forces, or extract demands from the West if the West wants assistance from Russia in some way.  This leaves Turkey, who wants Mr. Assad out, potentially in a difficult light, because they will not directly attack Russia in the now-rump states under siege. This gives Russia more leverage in the Levant.  Mr. Putin views his country\u2019s involvement in the region as a way to bargain with the West on his domestic and foreign policies that the Russians view as more important to them than Syria.  In another strategy, the Russians also have ISIS issues in the Northern Caucasus and may ask for intelligence or other assistance from Iran or the West to continue the war against ISIS in the Northern Caucasus,  as Russia builds a new front to attack the terrorists and to stabilize and maintain further power in that region. If successful in the Northern Caucasus, this will effectively allow Russia to control the area from Dagestan to Krasnodar Krai and have the capability to limit the movement of Turkey and Georgia in and across the northern land routes, for political or military reasons.
