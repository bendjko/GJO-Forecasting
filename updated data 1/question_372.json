The overriding priority will be to avoid a disorderly movement either up or down, and the PBoC clearly still has sufficient foreign exchange reserves to support the currency at least in the near term.\nThe RMB has been on a declining trend since the beginning of 2014 in large part due to dollar strength (see here for the trade-weighted chart https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TWEXB). Recently, the RMB has been relatively stable against other major currencies (e.g. the euro). The PBoC has been moving its focus away from just the dollar to a basket of currencies. \nSince the unexpected devaluation in August 2015, there have been four declines in the RMB of around 3-4% in any 68 day period. The biggest was 4.17% in January 2016. The time period in which the PBoC's current currency exchange policy has been in place is only relatively short (around 18 months).

The prevalence of their shadow banking (WMPs), unproductive infrastructure spending and arguably corruption suggest a crisis is quite probable over the next few years.

Two of these are speculators may push the movement more quickly than they'd like and secondly it may be criticised as being currency 'manipulation' to help their exports. The swap market for offshore Yuan has a much higher yield than the swap market for USD. Based on a no-arbitrage argument, the Yuan should have a tendency depreciate. The US economy is generally considered strong and it is likely that there central bank will continue hiking.  This may not eventuate though should negative economic surprises occur.  This alone would strengthen the Yuan relative to the Dollar.  Many speculators are long the Dollar and such a negative suprise may cause an abrupt move against the dollar.

USD weakening as a result of funds piling out of the crowded trade will see currency pairs across the globe strengthen as a result. Take for example many of the currency pairs that are already strengthening like CAD, EUR, AUD, and JPY. The resulting effect will see Yuan strengthen back below 6.6 in the coming months.

Of course it is to be expected that CNY would be cheaper when bought in a farther away futures contract due to time discounting. Let's say we average these and call the 28 April 2017 1 USD  = 7.14 CNY. Let's imagine that on 28 April 2017 we have 1 USD > 7.2 CNY. That would mean a loss of ~0.85% on this investment. This seems well within what investors would consider acceptable losses on a 4-month investment, so it's hard to rule out. On the other hand, if on 28 April 2017 we have 1 USD < 6.6 CNY that would mean a profit of over 8% in 4 months. This seems too high, most investments can only pull that off in a whole year in any reliable way. So below 6.6 seems very unlikely, or rather, judged to be very unlikely by the price-aggregated wisdom of people whose job it is to figure these things out. Anyway, to assign actual odds, let's think about returns. Most investments give around 6%-12% a year reliably. This means roughly 1.5%-3% every four months. Let's imagine investors model returns as a normal distribution [2] with mean 2.25% and standard deviation 1%. Under this model we get no chance of >8% returns and 0.1% chance of <-0.85% returns. This seems too extreme, so let's try a standard deviation of 2%; then we get 0.2% chance of >8% returns and 6% chance of <-0.85% returns. If we do the same exercise but modeling returns as N(3,2) (which I like because currency is a risky investment so the mean had better be higher) we get 0.6% odds of >8% returns and 2.7% odds of <-0.85% returns. Sort of averaging all this I come to my forecast.
