One of the factors I discussed in my last answer to this question, was that Putin may not want to attend the summit just to demonstrate that he is critical for any global discussion on any nuclear topic. I currently see three outcomes to the recent test that North Korea conducted: 1. The pressure is currently on China to control North Korea. Although China is the only power who in my opinion can significantly influence North Korea, I do not believe that they have as much control over Kim Jong-Un as many outsiders believe. This is mainly because Kim is young, inexperienced, erratic etc. He is not a statesman and cannot be influenced or worked with in the same way as his father or grandfather. What this means is that it could present an opportunity for Putin to take the lead. North Korea and Russia have a relationship. Putin could use this relationship to position himself as a global \"peace bringer\", by at least appearing to reign in Kim it makes Putin invaluable for the inevitable global discussion as to how the world should react. It will also give Putin more influence in Asia. I see this manoeuvre as possible, as I truly believe Putin is a very smart opportunist. On the other hand, I do not think that this will move Putin to attend the summit. These type of discussions will take place between foreign ministers and within the security council. I think the probability of this outcome and the probability of it causing him to attend the summit leads to a 2% increase. 2. Situation: North Korea has actually created a hydrogen bomb (unlikely, but who knows) and uses it against someone. I just do not think this is realistic. Kim knows, that to attack any other country with nuclear weapons would lead to instant death for his entire nation. I think Kim and his gang are creating nuclear missiles because they want leverage, and because they know that the global community cannot ignore them if they have nuclear weapons. At the same time, they know that use of a nuclear weapon would be the end of the comfortable (if isolated) lives that the autocrats in Pyongyang enjoy. So I do not think that they will actually use the weapons. On the other hand, if it did happen, It may lead to Putin attending the summit - although this is unlikely. An attack on any country would lead to instant action, and probably not much discussion. It would lead to an increase in global tension definitely, but I see almost no outcome where North Korea attacks a country, and the reaction of Putin is to attend a summit to talk about it! Additionally, the chances of an attack happening between now and March are just quite small. I will give this outcome a 1% chance. 3. The most likely outcome. Lots of condemnation against North Korea. The Chinese tell Kim to calm down. Kim ignores them for some time, makes some threats, talks about destroying the imperialistic enemies of the workers paradise. The status quo continues (not indefinitely I am sure, but at least until March). This outcome is the most likely, and I think the only impact it has on my original prediction, is that for a brief time Nuclear Security will climb higher in the publics perception as an important issue. This may push Putin to not attend to show how important he is for the discussion, or may push him to attend, to show how important, wise and caring he is to change his mind. I will increase the chance of him attending by 1% to reflect this. In summary, my initial estimate was that there is an 11% chance, based on recent events I think there is now a 15% chance. For the record, I do not think that they actually detonated a hydrogen bomb.

What is the reason that Putin does not want to attend?\nAccording to the articles linked above, the Russian government communicated to the Americans in mid-October that they would not attend the Nuclear Security Summit in Washington in 2016. The decision seemed to have been a reaction to the ongoing Ukraine Crisis and related events. According to the Washington Post article the US has also suspended several other committees and organisations that have been working together with Russia on a variety of issues. The Russians stated they do not want to attend as the organizers do not allow any dissenting opinions that are not aligned with US policy. The Russians say they will instead focus on nuclear issues through the IAEA. I don't believe that there is much hidden reasoning behind Putins decision not to attend. The conference is, compared to other things that Putin is facing, one that is not of central relevance. At the same time it is a summit that was founded by Obama, so it offers a simple way to snub Obama. I tried to find out if Putin had any other events or summits that are more important during this time frame, but found none. Although even if I had, it would not largely change my assumption that Putin decided not to go to the conference as a show of strength or as an insult to Obama and to signal that he does not want to follow the American lead on global issues. Additionally, this decision follows a trend of decreasing cooperation in nuclear issues, that started already at the end of 2014: https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2015/01/19/after-two-decades-russia-nuclear-security-cooperation-becomes-casualty-deteriorating-relations/5nh8NbtjitUE8UqVWFIooL/story.html. The full statement from the Russian government can be found here: http://archive.mid.ru//bdomp/brp_4.nsf/english/FDB1C2C6F7427FE4C3257D88004155B5 2. What will be the focus of the conference?\nFrom what I can see, the  conference has three main aims/goals. The first will be to establish working groups for continuing the steps that have already been taken and expanding on work that has already been done. According to Kenneth C. Brill (U.S. ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency from 2001 to 2004) and John Bernhard (Denmark\u2019s ambassador to the IAEA from 2005 to 2011): \"Early indications are that the 2016 event will lead to the announcement of additional voluntary proposals, along with a declaration that responsibility for further work on nuclear security issues will revert to the patchwork of institutions and mostly voluntary arrangements that predate the summit process, such as Interpol, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the G-8 Global Partnership and the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism.\" An article from nationalinterest.org sums it up nicely as: \"With the summits expected to conclude in 2016, leaders must use this last opportunity to begin work on a more sustainable nuclear security framework. To assist these efforts, the international expert community has developed a simple list of \u201c5 Priorities for Global Nuclear Security.\u201d These priorities represent the consensus of dozens of experts from around the world regarding how the global nuclear security system must evolve. Crucially, the system needs to become more comprehensive, open, rigorous and sustainable, and involve the reduction of nuclear material stockpiles.\". The second goal, will be to focus on diplomatic issues (both nuclear and non nuclear) between India and Pakistan: http://tribune.com.pk/story/1017357/nuclear-security-summit-obama-invites-nawaz-modi-to-washington-moot/. The summit would be an excellent place for these discussions. Finally, the third goal, will be to bring together global leaders for a general discussion and back room chats related to the issues that are currently ongoing. Many of the worlds leaders will be present. 3. Which of the issues that are going to be discussed at the conference are important to Russian interests?\nThe issues which will be discussed can, in my opinion, be broken down into nuclear and non nuclear issues. Or to be more direct, the official and non-official topics. An example of the official topics will be nuclear terrorism and isis, which I am sure is relevant to Russia. The second type of issues will be things like Pakistani and Indian relations, which will occur outside of the public eye. Obviously, any discussion relating to political relationships between countries is, in some way, shape or form, relevant for Putin. The conference is an opportunity for Obama and other participant nations to push for nuclear policy, which is also very important for Russia, one of the largest holders of nuclear material in the world. On the other hand, the summit will most likely not lead to the creation of any significant nuclear related policy changes as any such decisions or changes would require Russia's participation. Effectively, Putin has decreased the importance of the conference significantly by not attending. What that leaves is the back room politics, which will occur wether or not Putin is there (although Putin misses a chance to speak to Obama face to face) and finally, the issue of Pakistan and India. I do not believe that the remaining issues are important enough for Putin to change his mind and suddenly participate in the conference. 4. Has Putin changed his mind about attending similar events in the past, and if yes, why?\nThis was the hardest task to research, and as far as I can tell , he never has. What this indicates to me is that Putin will not change his mind at the risk of losing face. 5. What would have to happen in this case to make Putin change his mind and attend the conference?\nI think there are several things that could happen to make Putin change his mind. The first thing would be if the topic of nuclear material and its use would become a much higher priority for all stakeholders. This could be achieved through a terrorist attack by ISIS (or another terrorist group) using nuclear material (aka dirty bombs). This would mean that a terrorist group would have to get its hands on nuclear equipment (which is not unlikely or impossible: https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/us-unease-about-nuclear-weapons-fuel-takes-aim-at-a-south-african-vault/2015/03/13/b17389f6-2bc1-4515-962d-03c655d0e62d_story.html or http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34461732) and then use them in a terrorist attack somewhere between now and the end of March. Even if this did happen, there is (in my opinion) only a small chance that it would push Putin to attend the conference. For one, if the Uranium originated from within Russia's sphere of influence, I doubt Putin would travel to America to discuss the issue, as it would appear like he is kowtowing to the Americans and accepting responsibility. This is even more unlikely if the bombing were to occur within a Nato territory. One situation that I see Putin maybe changing his mind and attending, is if stolen nuclear material is used in a dirty bomb, within Syria, by ISIS (or another terrorist group). This could result in a situation similar to when chemical weapons were used in Syria and lead to a brief period of improved cooperation between Russia and Nato. Additionally, as Syria is probably the most pressing global issue at the moment, Obama could use such a crisis to bring Putin to America to discuss the overall Syria situation and plan next steps before the November elections. On the other hand, even in this case, Putin would most likely not agree to come to America to discuss the bombing or the overarching Syria issues as Putin does not appear to even want to give the impression of following Americas lead or of being beholden to or weaker than America. On the other hand, Putin could, in the case of this hypothetical dirty bomb, travel to America to show the world that he is an important statesman who is needed to solve the worlds serious problems. \nAnother thing that could happen is that Putin could change his mind to make himself look good. This could happen if America (or Nato) makes a serious mistake in the Syria conflict (or in any global conflict) and Putin attempts to opportunistically benefit from it. An example could be, if Nato accidentally destroys more hospitals or schools, or Nato somehow causes the Syrian peace process to be compromised, that Putin decides to travel to the summit to speak to the leaders of Nato to broker a deal, making him look like the hero. However, there would be a risk for Putin that he discusses issues with Obama, who cannot make any agreements that he can guarantee will still hold after November 2016. Although the chances of a Nato nation state making a significant mistake in some global conflict in some form are quite high, I do not believe that they will make a mistake so terrible that it would make Putin look good.\nThe other nuclear wild card is North Korea. If they were to use a bomb between now and March, there could be a reason for Putin to travel to the conference. However, Putin is probably closer to North Korea than to the USA right now, so I think there is only a very small chance that even if N Korea did launch a nuclear weapon at someone or something (which I think is unlikely), that it would result in Putin changing his mind and attending the summit.\nFinally, I think there is a chance that Putin may change his mind just so that he can face off with Obama on his own turf. There is no nuclear discussion that works without the presence and participation of Russia. Putin has significant leverage on nuclear topics, and may change his mind just so that he can try to \"beat\" Obama on his own turf, or rub it in the face of the American Government and people that he is a strong man with a lot to say in this discussion. So to summarize the main points: * Putin has never changed his mind about attending an invitation he already publicly declined.\n* Putin is not inclined to travel to America.\n* There has been an ongoing trend of decreasing cooperation regarding nuclear issues between Russia and the US.\n* By not attending, Putin can demonstrate that his presence is critical for any nuclear discussion.\n* By not attending, Putin shows that Russia is a key player in global politics.\n* The summit will, even if Putin did attend, probably not be massively significant in changing the way the world handles nuclear material, and will most likely just result in more follow up meetings or even the dissolution of the summit.\n* Nuclear topics are not the highest priority issues for Putin at the moment.\n* A dirty bomb would increase the priority of nuclear issues for all players.\n* A dirty bomb in Syria would increase the priority of the issue and tie it in with other ongoing global issues.\n* The dirty bomb in Syria would have to be detonated between now and March.\n* Putin may change his mind if Nato or the US makes some significant errors and Putin travels to America to somehow profit from the situation.\n* Putin may change his mind if North Korea uses a nuclear weapon between now and March on a significant target. I put the probability of Putin attending the conference very low. I think there is only a 2 or 3 percent chance of a dirty bomb being used between now and March. I would put that number lower, but unfortunately I believe that ISIS will start getting more and more desperate as they continue to lose ground, and this may push them to try more desperate things. I think that there is only a small chance that the US or another NATO state makes a significant enough error that would benefit Putin and lead to him changing his mind and attending the summit (2%). I think there is a small chance that some black swan event may occur that is much harder to predict (North Korea launching a Nuke at someone? Little green men?). I think there is also a 2% chance that Putin will change his mind at the last minute just to mess with Obama and show how important Russia is for any discussion of this topic.  Overall, I think there is an 11% chance that Putin attends the summit in March. Since almost all of the situations which would move him to visit are pretty horrifying, I truly hope he has no reason to attend!

The bloc is also working to determine which groups in Syria should be deemed terrorists, and whether to officially recognize the Syrian opposition groups that met in Saudi Arabia last week.

Like the business executive who seeks to co-ordinate business trips with personal activities (Florida in the winter) so as to accrue the intangible benefit (of sunshine) under a business expense reimbursement scheme, is it possible that Putin has demonstrated any historical proclivity to \"kill two birds with one stone\" by making trips which, on the surface appear to be for reason X, but behind-the-scenes may equally be for reason Y? I ask this because the S-300 delivery was apparently consummated under the auspices of Putin attending a regional gas conference. Might it be possible that Putin might wish to visit the United States at this time for some reason independent of the Nuclear Security Summit, and the Summit might be a useful cover for such a visit? Kerry will supposedly be in Moscow this week. There are, one would expect, continuous discussions between Washington and Moscow on a variety of subjects at a variety of levels. Perhaps there is some subject that percolates to the top, so to speak, where a face-to-face meeting between Putin and Obama would be important. Certainly such a meeting could occur independently of the Summit, but then the subject of the meeting becomes a special topic of (perhaps undesired) focus. To my mind Russia has more-or-less divorced themselves from the U.S.-led  Summit approach to nuclear security, and seems to be in favor of establishing the IAEA as the premier international body for this function. Why would they desire to support the \"Summit alternative\" to the IAEA? Yet, such a meeting would provide a very plausible reason for Putin to come to the United States without an alternative reason becoming the focus of public attention.
