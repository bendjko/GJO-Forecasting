Having risked a lot during his earlier tenure to affirm the right to hire and fire the army chiefs, PM Sharif has refrained from rushing into a decision that could cost him his current office. When he boldly replaced General Pervez Musharraf in October 1999 after the failed Kargil putsch by the army chief in the summer of that year, PM Sharif found himself in a prison and then a near-decade-long exile in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Given that background, it is quite remarkable that PM Sharif avoided giving an extension to General Sharif. http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/General-Sharif-a-known-India-baiter-on-way-out/articleshow/55552299.cms\nAccording to government and military sources, the name of the next Army chief has been finalized with consent of the COAS, but it has been decided the name would be disclosed just before Gen Sharif 's retirement on Nov 29.

Here is why. Comment:  Time is now is of the essence.  There are approximately (80) days left to resolution of this GJ Q.  To date, Nawaz Sharif has proved to be a \"foxy\" character, politically & physically speaking. He has survived a heart issue. (FN1)  He has survived internal political attacks. (2). He has more recently acted v Prime Ministerial  @ the UN in NYC making his case on Kashmir. (3). He is about to make a SIGNIFICANT decision on General Raheel Sharif (4). This critical decision has once again heated up the sensitive issue of who in Pakistan is actually in charge this past week when a travel ban was placed on journalist Cyril Almeida (5). Sharif continues to make political waves w/ Modi on the various cross border issues, primarily Kashmir. (6) IMPORTANTLY, administration makes the case, Pakistan is making economic progress &, continuing to extend itself b/y its borders w/ important Partners such as Russia & China. (7) Conclusion: The Panama Papers controversy carries less immediate intensity (8), when viewed from the above referenced perspective as Sharif as attempts to \"manage\" to his advantage.  Physically & politically he has survived to date. Considering the above-mentioned timing issue, there is a high probability he will continue at, least through resolution date of this Q.  @Khalid's recent response to @AndrewSabisky 's query is instructive military appointment, which does carry significant implications inasmuch as we are addressing the Pakistan situation. Considering the flashpoint capabilities Pakistan carries, the next sixty days are worth covering closely.

Comment: On the one hand, PM Nawaz Sharif is making every reasonable appearance of being able to overcome health and, domestic political opponent issues. He is, arguably, looking more Prime Ministerial as time passes relative to initiation of this GJ Q. On the other hand, the recent events surrounding Altaf Hussain ( leader of Muttahida Qaumi Movement) living in exile in London make clear PM Sharif still manages to survive in the TROUBLED WATERS of Pakistan. (2) In support of the argument that he will remain Prime Minister through year end, he is now scheduled to make a two/three week trip to the U.S.beginning 13/9/16 where, among other visits, he will address the UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY on Pakistan issues including the thorny issue of Kashmir.  Whether he ALSO makes his IMPORTANT  decision on the future Chief of Army Staff General beforehand, is an open question. NB attached(1). What is clear, however, is PM Sharif is making every effort to keep the still powerful yet controversial Raheel Sharif \" in the fold\" with this weekends new offer of two key posts, which are up for his consideration. Conclusion:\nThere remains approximately one hundred & twenty days to resolution of this GJ Q. Geopolitically speaking, that is still a great deal of time. On the one hand, Pakistan is Pakistan & Nawaz Sharif is Nawaz Sharif so, a lot can happen without significant notice.  On the other hand, every piece of circumstantial evidence since his health issues continues to support the hypothesis that Nawaz Sharif will do what is necessary to remain PM through 2016. (1) http://www.onlinenews.com.pk/index.php?page=newsdetail&news_id=4982 \"...\nThe CoAS did not respond to the government offer yet , but the reliable sources said that Prime Minister who is going to USA on 13 September, wants to resolve the issue  that which seat is suitable for General Raheel Sharif before leaving  for America . As PM Nawaz Sharif would go on almost 20 days foreign  visit as before going to USA he would also stay at London for a short time where he would undergo his medical check-up. The political and diplomatic circles are giving special importance to PM\u2019s visit to USA.  As the speech of Prime Minister in the United Nations General Assembly  and his meetings with international leaders  would define the future policy of Pakistan .\nThe analysts have the opinion that at present USA is completely tilting towards India and Afghanistan , whereas on the other hand Pak- China relations are on its peak.

Here is why. Comment: My originally cautious forecast was based on medical uncertainty. Having given approximately ninety days (90) since this original May forecast, these medical uncertainties continue to be reduced.  We now have more circumstantial evidence & know  more about his abilities to sustain a Prime Minister agenda. For example, on the one hand, Nawaz Sharif  is politically combative, if not particularly cautious on the message of support to Kashmiri people recently (Footnote 1). With India's PM Modi pushing back on the Balochistan issue,  PM Sharif is certainly NOT signaling weakness and, will forcefully raise the Kasmir issue at the UN General Assembly in September. (2) Finally, on the geopolitical front, Modi recently warned it will become more assertive on its claims to Pakistan controlled areas of Kasmir, a key transit point to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. (3)  On the other hand, domestically, he continues to push the economic stability agenda which is further supportive of his changing, more active hands on roll  both internationally and, within Pakistan.(4)  Additionally, on the all important appointment of the new Chief of the Army Staff General ( presently Raheel Sharif ) decision, PM Sharif has made clear, ALTHOUGH he will be the decision maker, he is certainly SUBJECT TO military influence  as well.(5)   WHEN this decision will be made is an open Question. (5) The succession is scheduled to take place upon General Sharif's retirement, end of November.  Conclusion:  With slightly more than One Hundred & Twenty (120) left to RESOLUTION of this GJ Q, considering all the above-mentioned issues, the probabilities have increased measurably that Sharif can hold out for another four months.  Each one of these domestic & geopolitical above referenced issues when considered as a whole, portray an individual that has every intention of doing what IS NECESSARY to remain \"in office\".

He had successful open heart surgery in London in June, 2016 (his second visit to London for medical attention in 2016), but his health problems and the protracted absences from Pakistan that they have caused have led to calls for an interim Prime Minister to be elected in his stead in the last month. An attempt by Ishaq Dar, the Pakistani finance minister, to act as PM in Sharif's absence have triggered a constitutional crisis, leading to demands for his immediate return to office. There is some speculation that this is a ploy by the opposition to force Sharif's hand - if he is not well enough to return to office, and another cannot act as PM in his place, then this could trigger an immediate general election, or at least the official appointment of a caretaker PM. Moreover, dynastic politics are important in Pakistan. Sharif's daughter is believed to be poised to assume leadership of his own political dynasty after he steps down. There is a chance, therefore, that the combined pressure of his health problems and mounting political opposition may lead him to stand down if doing so enhances his dynasty's chances of returning to power in the future (he has, himself, returned to power twice following his first term of office). Above all, since the end of military rule in 2002 (not counting caretaker prime ministers), Prime Ministers of Pakistan have remained in office for an average of 21 months - Sharif has already served 36.  This suggests that there is a reasonable chance of Sharif not being PM by the end of 2016. On the other hand, the Panama Papers scandal is unlikely to damage him too severely: he has weathered corruption storms in the past, as have several of Pakistan's leading political figures. Sharif's approval ratings were extremely high throughout 2014 and 2015 (driven by heavy investment in popular public works projects), and have not dipped significantly. Whilst there has been a degree of international outcry, the impact of the scandal has been limited within Pakistan itself. If it were to have a significant effect (which seems unlikely at present), this would be felt at the ballot box, and the next (scheduled) general election will not be until 2018. Perhaps the most compelling evidence is that Sharif still enjoys the grudging support of the armed forces. The rapprochement that he has championed between military and civil leadership seems likely to safeguard his position. Moreover, the ongoing Taliban insurgency has served to occupy the army, and has united the political and security sectors in Pakistan in a shared cause. Although the military has, on several occasions, intervened in Pakistani politics, it is unlikely, in the short term at least, that Sharif will be removed in a military coup. Therefore, if Sharif ceases to be PM in Pakistan before the end of 2016, it is most likely that he will step down because of his health rather than because of pressure brought to bear as a result of the Panama Papers revelations. His health problems are serious (minimum recovery time from open heart surgery is 6 weeks; for a man of his age, in his condition, it could reasonably be expected to be longer), and the opposition have proved effective so far in preventing a proxy from taking power in his stead. If Sharif cannot return to power quickly, therefore, there is a good chance that he may have no choice but to step down. However, if he can hang on for the next two months and return, visibly and actively, to office, then there is a very good chance that he will be able to consolidate his position and remain in power for 2016. Therefore, if Sharif is still in power at the end of August, I will revise my prediction down."], [691, "2016-06-21T12:32:34Z", [0.14], ""], [14208, "2016-06-21T00:42:38Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2016-06-20T21:52:54Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-06-20T21:50:13Z", [0.14], ""], [1646, "2016-06-20T21:39:55Z", [0.21], ""], [14182, "2016-06-20T08:04:19Z", [0.2], "Date: 20.

China's PM extend his well wishes. The long standing geopolitical friendship between the two may \"seem\" improbable but, China recognizes Pakistan was one of those Countries who first recognized the PRC. After Tiananmen Square, Pakistan was one of the only Countries who stood by China. There are many other examples of this long standing relationship even though over the many years, it has been strained at times.  Granted, such  a relationship transcends individuals, however, it is nonetheless v supportive to Nawaz. b) Imran Khan's posturing over the Panama Paper issue, has not helped his cause and, actually caused in some quarters a back last against the PTI. http://aaj.tv/2016/06/chinese-prime-minister-extends-best-wishes-for-speedy-recovery-of-nawaz/ \"...According to a press release issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs here on Thursday, Chinese Ambassador to UK Liu Xiaoming called on Pakistan\u2019s High Commissioner in London and conveyed the following message on behalf of Premier Li Keqiang along with flowers, for the Prime Minister of Pakistan...\" http://thediplomat.com/2016/06/imran-khans-unwarranted-posturing-over-the-panama-papers/ \"...While accountability and justice are subjects which the PTI has rallied for since their inception, Khan has a history of coming under fire for personal attacks or issuing personal statements during the election campaigns in the lead up to the 2013 elections.

Since 1947 civilian governments have lasted respectively 11 years, 6 years and 11 years again before being overthrown by the military. So Pakistan's history suggests the possibility of a coup in the next few years. Lets start by assuming an even money chance of a coup sometime in the next four years. The allegations of corruption against Sharif's family suggest that a coup, if it is to happen, will more than likely occur for a publicly justifiable reason, and is therefore most likely in the remaining months of 2016, though early 2017 is still quite possible. Lets say that if it happens its an 80% chance of occurring in 2016. That lowers my assessment of the odds to 50%*80%=40%. However history also suggests that democracy is taking hold-2013 gave Pakistan the first civilian transfer of power after the successful completion of a five year term by a democratically elected government. Presumably also the military has a weather eye on the chaos that has ensued in the middle east after the overthrow of governments, albeit not democratic ones. I will arbitrarily calculate that each of these factors halves the potential risks and bring my forecast down to 40%*1/2*1/2=10%. The next  factor to consider is Sharif pledging to resign if found to be corrupt. At the moment he has plausible deniability as the allegations concern his family and not him. I believe that an inquiry will be under international pressure to keep Pakistan's democracy on track for fear of Pakistan's nuclear capabilities. Basis this I'll leave the odds where they are. However a couple of other possibilities to consider are 1) Sharif personally getting implicated as more documents are revealed and 2) Sharif being the victim of a plane crash, bombing or even his death from natural causes.

This constrains the preference set to a small number of choices and consequently, with one outcome (leaving office), preferences over choices are an extremely small set.  Since corruption, patronage and de facto military/ruling elite coalition are prominent features of the Pakistani polity, one should expect that the PM's minimum winning coalition will remain in tact.    Therefore, given the function, g: X --> A  choices under conditions of certainty, require that {a1, ...., a(k)} be mapped topologically as one member of A to the outcome set X. X = {x1, ...,  x(n)}.  this constraint requires that the conditional action or choice in a maximized choice set suggest that the only option that would result in an outcome of the PM leaving office, is when he no longer has the support of the minimum winning coalition in the polity.   If this conditional outcome requires a negative action (or choice) compared to the previous preference, then the outcome will suggest a likely possibility that the PM will leave office.  However, given that the PM leaving office requires a choice set of A = {coercion, loss of a minimum coalition, and significant threat toward the PM}, this would be analytically and theoretically support leaving office.  However, given that corruption in Pakistan is deeply ingrained in its polity and the Panama Papers revelation has been open knowledge in Pakistan for some time, we can deduce with a high degree of confidence that the PM will not leave office.   While he is left with an uncomfortable option if explaining the matter, it does not change the actions and choice which will lead to him leaving office. The assumption that the question focuses on leaving office and NOT removed from office, it is sufficient to deduce that precision in the analytic process is not confused with actions and a choice set that require a different, if not larger choice set, among which could include assassination.  However, assassination over an insignificant matter demonstrate a level of absurdity that lead us to irrational decision making.
