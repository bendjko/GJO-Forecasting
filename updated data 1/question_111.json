In TX in 2015 the drought was ended when the reservoirs filled but the magnitude of the problem in CA is much greater; it would take almost double the yearly average rainfall in order to bring the conditions out of the bottom 20% of 4-year average accumulations. Further, many reservoirs in CA are filled via imports that come from snow melt in the mountains, which is expected to decrease this year. Also, El Nino is notoriously unpredictable, creating even greater uncertainty as to its effects (likelihood of not filling reservoirs: 95%). Further, the question states that even modifications to the rules count as an extension, this includes loosening (but not eliminating) restrictions. Given the info above regarding El Nino rainfalls, if the CA government decides to change usage rules, a loosening is much more likely than a total elimination (85%). \n--\n@Mos  The following text is from the fact sheet dated January 15, 2016 and titled, Extending the Emergency Water Conservation Regulation (Proposed Regulatory Changes to Achieve Statewide Reductions in Urban Potable Water Usage): \"It is too early to tell whether or not additional rain and snowfall will put the State in the position where the existing restrictions are no longer necessary, or could be further tempered.

In TX in 2015 the drought was ended when the reservoirs filled but the magnitude of the problem in CA is much greater; it would take almost double the yearly average rainfall in order to bring the conditions out of the bottom 20% of 4-year average accumulations. Further, many reservoirs in CA are filled via imports that come from snow melt in the mountains, which is expected to decrease this year. Also, El Nino is notoriously unpredictable, creating even greater uncertainty as to its effects (likelihood of not filling reservoirs: 95%). Further, the question states that even modifications to the rules count as an extension, this includes loosening (but not eliminating) restrictions. Given the info above regarding El Nino rainfalls, if the CA government decides to change usage rules, a loosening is much more likely than a total elimination (85%). \nCons: El Nino is particularly strong this year and so far is concentrated in the upper part of California, where most of the state's reservoirs exist. Also, given El Nino's unpredictable nature, it is possible (5%) that we see an extraordinarily convenient weather pattern. Also, the question specifically states urban water use as opposed to agriculture water use. Urban use only accounts for about 20% of the state's water usage. This creates political uncertainty as the Democrat urban areas may feel unfairly burdened by the restrictions compared to the more Republican rural areas.
