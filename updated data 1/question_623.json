As at least during the last year the EWP determined that it was a mass killing. It's not 100% certain if they will choose to do so again, as this depends on the systematic and targeted nature of the killings related to the drug war. But so far I would assume that, as the official rethoric has not changed and drug users still get targeted systematically, this question will still be resolved positively. The consensus therefore seems a bit off to me.

There is no doubt that local police and national military and law enforcement personnel have killed more than enough people to make their quota under this Q, and will continue to do so.  This is a national campaign, conducted at the instruction or with the approval of the President of the Republic.  The fact that he uses various agencies in different parts of the country to murder people should not, in my not-very-humble opinion, mean he and minions are off the hook for the murders of thousands of civilians.   However, scoring is not necessarily connected to what the rest of us perceive as reality.  Scores on this Q will come down to the personal predilections of the GJedi.  The families of the dead people will doubtless appreciate the scrupulosity with which these distinctions will be made.  To be more nearly fair, one understands that this situation puts the scorers in a quandary owing to the definitions previously laid out.  Their proble, with which one sympathsizes, is whether to stick to the letter or the spirit of what they presumably want to know.

The police have killed over 2,000 civilians in the campaign against drug traffickers. Whether that is an armed group engaging in a campaign policy that knowingly results in widespread civilian deaths is something the administrators will have to clarify. Considering that the question is being asked, I assume that the answer is no given that it is not a specific civilian group being targeted, but rather an ambiguous \"drug dealer\" group defined by the civilian population and the police. Without clarification if the drug war (and the subsequent targeting of \"drug dealers\") meets the definition above, it's unlikely this will be resolved as a yes. Additionally, the lack of clarity by the government and police forces makes it difficult to assess whether its a campaign by an armed group against civilians.
