I'm not especially clear about the final signatory process of final rules that have made it through the regulatory process, probably because the process is generally pro forma.  \nPresident signs of (https://www.federalregister.gov/uploads/2011/01/the_rulemaking_process.pdf - pg 7 Q: What is the role of the President in developing a final rule?) However, this lawyer with a focus on gun rights / NRA (among other things) points out that the Attorney General signs off on final regulations and is not the only one to have questions whether the acting AG, Whitaker, appointed by Trump is a probably-legal-but-atypical manner, is legally able to perform the function of Attorney General (Democrat lawsuit in DC district, another in MD district court, and another in Supreme Court).\nhttp://www.sdslaw.us/single-post/2018/12/09/Can-the-Acting-Attorney-General-enact-new-regulations\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/19/us/politics/democrats-lawsuit-whitaker-attorney-general.html\nhttps://www.theusconstitution.org/news/sens-blumenthal-whitehouse-and-hirono-sue-trump-over-whitaker-appointment/\nhttps://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/488-d-d-c-18-cv-02664-dckt-000001/7e324bc868a0d4b453b0/optimized/full.pdf#page=1\nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/13/matthew-whitaker-maryland-court-challenge/1986221002/ The Senate's research group clearly believes Whitaker's appointment is secure and their argument seems pretty well-founded, or at least secure enough to not general much risk.\nhttps://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/LSB10217.pdf\nhttps://www.senate.gov/CRSpubs/3d313cc2-9515-4533-b1f0-3f762cd09007.pdf But none of this probably matters very much for the AG position since Trump has announced he's putting a former AG (from the G. H. W. Bush Admin) who probably will get enough bipartisan support to pass.  Grassley approves, and although he's stepping down as Chair of the Senate Judiciary, which must confirm the appointment, he is staying as a member.  And Graham is the probable replacement as the majority party senior member after Grassley, and Graham has publicly stated he'll do what he can to get Barr confirmed.  \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-confirms-he-will-pick-william-barr-as-his-next-attorney-general/2018/12/07/6e8d28ba-fa2d-11e8-863c-9e2f864d47e7_story.html?utm_term=.15f0b8b7d587\nhttps://www.radioiowa.com/2018/12/11/senator-grassley-doesnt-expect-any-issues-in-confirming-new-attorney-general/\nhttps://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/16/sen-chuck-grassley-gives-up-senate-judiciary-chair-head-finance-committee/2024820002/\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/lindsey-graham-likely-chair-senate-judiciary-committee-2018-11\nhttps://thehill.com/homenews/administration/420268-graham-vows-to-push-trumps-ag-pic-through-judiciary-committee\nhttps://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/12/07/lindsey-graham-do-everything-power-confirm-william-barr-attorney-general/ Which might matter if the DOJ is waiting to finalize the rule until they have an undisputed Attorney General to sign off on any pending issues, especially as a way to reduce later challenges (which in the case of this rule seem pretty likely already).  I don't know if they are obligated to publish a final rule within a certain time limit after it completes the final OMB review.  Because of the Congressional Review Act, both houses of Congress must receive and approve rules before they are finalized by committees dealing with issues relevant to the rule, and although both houses have to issue a joint resolution to overturn the rule, and this doesn't seem to me to be a rule likely to get significant push back from enough people to be an issue, I can see that the issue of the AG's authority might hold it up. But regardless of whether the authority issue at the DOJ has anything to do with a delay, the final rule hasn't made it's way to the GAO for Congressional review.  And once any major rule (i.e. economically significant) is submitted to congress, the GAO will track it.  Although a rule can be published first, this one doesn't seem to have been so far, and the GAO tracking page also doesn't seem to show that the DOJ's bump-stock type device rule has been submitted to Congress either.  \nhttps://www.gao.gov/legal/other-legal-work/congressional-review-act/\nhttps://www.gao.gov/products/D07440#mt=e-report\nhttps://www.gao.gov/decisions/majrule/fedrule2.pdf I'm also not sure what to make of the ATF's memo on gun accessories yesterday which @Daveinsea posted earlier\nhttps://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/796168 Tagging others active here who might have better understanding of the regulatory process: @Emil, @pietrokc, @Anneinak, @cmeinel, @nigster, @Wildwood2000, @JMR2017 "], [43311, "2018-12-12T04:58:45Z", [1.0], "Al....most.....there.....

I also can't tell if the Justice Department would circulate a memo like this to prompt reaction from gun sellers and law enforcement agencies (since the article says an ATF spokepeson claims they're still considering comments from the public period this last summer) or if they've delayed posting the final rule to give sellers and law enforcement time to prepare for mad chaos when the rule is proposed and people get angry.  If the thread is anything to go by and there is still only a 5% expectation that this will go through by the end of the year, maybe this one will end up being a bit of a shock.  On the other hand, it makes sense, given the economic significance and the fact that both gun sellers and law enforcement will need to prepare for next steps.  So the final publishing seems to me to be pretty firmly set, still actively in the process on many levels, but not clear when it will be finalized in the Federal Register.  Still, it seems to me moving ahead and therefore more likely to be published within 1-2 weeks than that it will be delayed having already reached everything but final sign off.  And the memo does suggest a typical 90 day period after the rule is published for it to go into effect, though it seems from the question details that this will not affect the outcome of the question since the publishing counts as a formal federal ban. https://kstp.com/national/feds-mum-on-bump-stock-ban-memo-obtained-by-kstp/5167573/\nhttps://kstp.com/news/kstp-obtains-federal-memo-detailing-ban-on-bump-stocks/5166175/?cat=1"], [41373, "2018-12-06T11:00:12Z", [0.6], "This is anticipated to happen soon, and has been 'promised' in days or weeks; may be a goodwill gift for the festive season, bizarre as it sounds.
