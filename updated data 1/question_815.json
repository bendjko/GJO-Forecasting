September 30. . . [is]  the date set out by Washington to deliver the text of a deal with or without Canada before making public (within 30-days) the text to the bilateral trade deal the United States struck with Mexico on August 30. The US administration is following the time constraints designated by the Trade Promotion Authority, also known as fast track, to ensure the agreement is subject to a straight up-or-down vote by the US Congress. Any amendments would require the negotiations to be reopened. The fast-track timing allows for a total of 90 days for consultation with Congress and stakeholders to consider the proposed agreement prior to beginning the legislative ratification process. This also coincides critically with December 1, when Mexico transitions power to its new President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador. The current administrations both of Mexico and the United States would prefer to see the deal ratified by both countries in advance of Mexico\u2019s new president taking power as there is concern from both countries that his administration could reject some of the provisions, forcing the parties back to the negotiating table. However, Canadian officials have been taking a hard line in negotiations and have stated they would rather have no deal than bind Canada to a bad deal. They also feel that the US Congress would only support a trilateral free trade deal. However, that support was called into question recently when Republican Congressman and House Whip, Steve Scalise, made a statement suggesting Congress was growing impatient with Canada\u2019s negotiating tactics. That could be just tough talk in hopes of hastening the conclusion of negotiations that have been going on for more than a year in advance of a critical mid-term election and the initiation of a new government in Mexico. Canada hopes so, but also knows that President Donald Trump has demonstrated his willingness to staunchly uphold his negotiating positions. With the deadline upon us, the question is, what happens if Canada and the US don\u2019t sign a deal? As has been the case throughout the NAFTA negotiations, the answer isn\u2019t black and white. Canada could still insert itself into the bilateral deal. If no deal is reached by September 30th, there\u2019s no reason Canada couldn\u2019t continue to negotiate in hopes of inserting itself into the deal after that date. Speculation has emerged the Canadian delegation is loath to publicly accept a deal that most believe will contain concessions on access to the Canadian dairy market before the provincial election on October 1 in Quebec, where much of Canada\u2019s dairy is produced. Meanwhile the text of the US-Mexico deal will be made publicly available in accordance with US law.  . . .  The US could withdraw from NAFTA. In the event no deal is reached between the US and Canada by September 30th, Washington could conceivable choose to officially withdraw from NAFTA as it puts its bilateral deal with Mexico before Congress. This would set off a six-month timeline for the termination of the agreement, during which time the US and Canada could (and likely would) continue to negotiate to either find a way to include Canada in a trilateral deal with Mexico or negotiate a separate bilateral agreement with Canada. There could be a zombie NAFTA. If Washington chooses to withdraw from NAFTA, only Congress can repeal the actual legislation associated with NAFTA. If Congress refused to do so, it would create what is often referred to as a Zombie NAFTA in which the agreement itself becomes defunct but many of the laws and provisions would continue to live on while others (such as the Chapter 19 dispute resolution mechanism) would no longer apply. That would be almost as detrimental as a Congressional approval of US withdrawal from NAFTA as cross-border investment would likely grind to a halt in response to the uncertainty around the terms of trade. However, if Congress were to approve the US-Mexico bilateral deal, it\u2019s almost certain lawmakers would also approve a withdrawal from NAFTA as the bilateral deal would ultimately override the terms of NAFTA. The US could impose tariffs on Canadian automobile imports. The threat of a 25-percent tariff on auto imports under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962\u2014the same law the US used to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum\u2014has been repeatedly mentioned by Trump administration officials. Such a move would have one of two effects. The first is that it could generate enough bad blood between Washington and Ottawa (and Canadians and Americans) to indefinitely stall free trade negotiations in spite of the economic consequences. The second is that it would become enough of a political liability to Canada\u2019s governing Liberal Party that it would prompt Ottawa to offer greater concessions within a revised NAFTA to hasten Canada\u2019s inclusion in a trilateral deal. It should be noted, however, that one of the lingering issues in the NAFTA talks is that Washington won\u2019t provide Ottawa with guarantees that it won\u2019t impose the Section 232 tariffs on Canadian automobiles even in the event a deal is reached on NAFTA. Congress could reject the US-Mexico bilateral trade deal. Despite some recent signs of frustration and impatience, members of Congress have signalled repeatedly they would prefer a trilateral deal over a bilateral one with Mexico. In response, they could refuse to ratify the bilateral deal, ultimately forcing resumption of talks between the US and Canada. Resumption of negotiations would likely mean no deal could be reached until well into 2019 as the US would be in the midst of mid-term elections or a lame-duck Congress for the remainder of 2018 and a new Mexican administration would likely want to revisit whatever terms were agreed to by the current administration.\n. . . \n. . .  the immediate period is really only another phase of negotiations that have been ongoing for more than year. September 30 will mark the end of this phase and October 1 will mark the beginning of the next phase. And we\u2019ll know soon enough what the tone and pace of negotiations will be in that phase. The saga will almost certainly continue in one form or another."], [20504, "2018-09-26T19:40:42Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2018-09-26T17:50:16Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2018-09-26T12:08:19Z", [0.0], ""], [28166, "2018-09-26T09:02:54Z", [0.0], ""], [19022, "2018-09-26T07:45:49Z", [0.0], "Only in drewMs "], [368, "2018-09-25T18:58:11Z", [0.0], ""], [31450, "2018-09-25T16:33:34Z", [0.0], "Dropping to zero because there is less than a week left."], [11080, "2018-09-25T15:28:29Z", [0.03], ""], [41373, "2018-09-25T12:52:24Z", [0.0], "It seems unlikely that an executive order would be judged to have any political value in this the final week of the question.

People: DJT has consistently said he wants to tear up NAFTA.   We're reading that the letter to do so has been on his desk for signature more than once and was whisked away by aides, so it appears that the only constraint on him issuing a letter of notice of intent to withdraw is \"patriotic\" WH staffers.  Objective:  Assert himself as The Deal Maker of the Century.   DJT prides himself on being a deal-maker and negotiations are a game for him.  His modus operandi seems to be to declare everything he does a \"tremendous success\", so so long as it is a new deal, it will be a \"tremendous success\".   He seems to think, not without reason, that he is immune to public displeasure, so may have minimal concern for whatever disapproval his new deal might generate.    Therefore, I think  that there's no downside in his mind to issuing a letter of intent to withdraw  and that DJT will see it as a win no matter what happens. Motivation:  \n-Assert himself as the Alpha Male over a new Mexican president (or the lame duck) and a young, photogenic Canadian PM.  \n-To keep his campaign promise.\n-To generate headlines.\n-To create something else he did that he can claim was a \"tremendous success\".

At this point, I think many of the rest of the announced deadlines will melt away as they have in the past because a bi-lateral deal is going nowhere.   At this point, I don't see Trudeau handing Trump a victory that he would use to boast about himself that ultimately would hurt Trudeau, making him look weak.

(Agree with @dada comments) It seems that the Trump tactic has failed and if Democrats take the House and/or Senate, Trump will lose leverage in the negotiation. Alternatively, a small compromise could happen on dairy after October 1 in exchange for US backing down on Chapter 19 dispute resolution panels.

It will resolve as \u201cYes\u201d only if one of the parties (the US?) sends to the other parties a notice containing the elements envisaged in the NAFTA treaty (e.g., invoking Article 2205) before the deadline. I presume the US administration can do this on behalf of the US (but also see the useful comments of @Emil ), but for the moment they have declared no intention of doing so (see the comments of @pietrokc).   - if the above is not done, any other action of the US administration seems irrelevant to the question. Sending a notification of a new treaty to Congress (as they did on August 31) or even sending the actual text of a US-Mexico treaty by end-September does not resolve the question as a \u201cYes\u201d. While it may well create confusion in Congress, in principle it is legally possible for the US to have two treaties with Mexico (and Canada), as long as it is clear which one has precedence in case of conflict.   - on the substance, think about it: NAFTA contains a few thousand pages of detailed provisions. What we know about the US-Mexico agreement is that it concerns a relatively limited number of issues that modify some (but far from all) of the original NAFTA provisions. So either the US-Mexico agreement copies and pastes the unmodified parts (in which case, it would amount to a modified NAFTA), or simply states that the unmodified parts remain effective (in which case it modifies, but does not repeal NAFTA). Either way, large parts of NAFTA remain in place, unless specifically repealed.   - can the US administration actually give notice in line with NAFTA procedures? This is certainly possible, but unlikely. Again, the issue is the unmodified parts of NAFTA - they have to be either repealed (unpopular with business groups) or incorporated in the new treaty (which may slow Congress\u2019 approval given the size of the document). Beside, why would the administration bother - for them it is sufficient to announce that NAFTA is effectively dead (as Trump has) without incurring the economic and legal costs of actually repealing it.

Since primaries are done, Republicans will not be threatened by Trump-aligned challengers and have more latitude to stand up to him.

L\u00f3pez Obrador, known as AMLO, opposed NAFTA at the time it was signed. But like many on the Canadian left, he has since come around as Mexico\u2019s economy opened and the conventional wisdom in the country saw the deal as central to its economic prospects. \u201cIn both countries, the center-left parties that originally opposed NAFTA in 1994 came out to defend it. Perhaps not with great enthusiasm, but they defend it,\u201d said Joydeep Mukherji, who leads the Americas Sovereign Ratings section at S&P Global. \u201cThe bad news is that the overall fate of the NAFTA negotiations remains up in the air.\u201d\n. . . \n\u201cAMLO didn\u2019t run on a NAFTA-friendly platform, but NAFTA was never part of the campaign, and he\u2019s on several occasions expressed support for NAFTA and its renegotiation,\u201d said Monica DeBolle, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. L\u00f3pez Obrador he has raised concerns about how a new agreement could affect Mexican agriculture, but that particular issue has thus far not played a central part in negotiations. Beyond that, L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s cabinet picks, who will be responsible for much of the negotiation, signal an interest in a successful renegotiating of NAFTA. \u201cOn the NAFTA, negotiations, they would not be the ones to walk away from the table,\u201d said Richard Miles, director of the U.S.-Mexico Futures Initiative at the Center for Strategic International Studies\n. . . \nThe NAFTA talks have been stalled, making it all but impossible for them to conclude before the midterm elections in November \u2014 when Trump faces the real danger that Republicans could lose the House majority. Several major sticking points have slowed talks, including disagreements about whether to include a sunset clause, rules of origin on products such as automobiles and the use of an international dispute settlement mechanism when problems arise. Trump\u2019s threat to impose new auto tariffs has the potential to destabilize new talks. Adding a new 25 percent import tax on Mexican-built cars could explode the discussions on rules of origin, which lay out how much of a car can be built in Mexico or Canada to qualify for sale in the U.S. under NAFTA. Trump directed the Commerce Department to look into the issue and could act as soon as it issues a report, potentially as early as September. Another potentially important factor is L\u00f3pez Obrador and Trump\u2019s personal chemistry.\n. . . \nOn that front, initial signs are positive. Trump spent a half-hour on the phone with L\u00f3pez Obrador on Monday and told reporters afterward that the conversation went well. S&P Global predicted that, despite hiccups, a new deal would eventually get signed. Even if negotiations to renew NAFTA fall apart, however, scrapping the trade arrangement altogether remains a distant prospect. That would require Trump to formally withdraw from the treaty, plus congressional action to undo NAFTA-related legislation.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  My forecast has been high in anticipation of the Mexican election which I think will change the dynamics.  Though this article gives me a better read on Obrador's personality and politics, I'm not sure how the dynamics of the NAFTA negotiations will change.   I see this issue/question as one that lends itself to a persons-objectives-means analysis.   This question doesn't ask if NAFTA will fall apart; it asks if the US will withdraw:  that means that this question hinges on DJT who has the means.   Will he withdraw?\nDJT has his SCOTUS nomination for headlines this week and meeting Putin for shortly thereafter.  Maybe he'll resist the temptation to make headlines by doing this.  I don't know whether the election of Obrador will make him pause (as Obrador has a history of punching back, like DJT) or make him take action.  \n\nThus far, it seems to me that DJT has put following-through on his campaign rhetoric above practical considerations of the value of those statements, and seems unconcerned about the fallout from his actions.  So far, the only things he hasn't done are back out of NATO and kill Obamacare.   His intentions are opaque to me.    Could it be that DJT's intentions are opaque to me because I can't believe anyone would do many of the things he's done?   All segments of the country oppose withdrawal from NAFTA:  multi-national corporations, Mom & Pops, agri-business, family farmers, manufacturing, retail, Chambers of Commerce, state &local politicians,  bankers, and financial & economic analysts.  This question seems like as much of a no-brainer to me as the question we had years ago about if Shinzo Abe would go to the Yasukuni shrine before New Years.   My thoughts about Abe & Yasukuni were, \"No way.  Only an idiot would do that.\"  I didn't know that Abe had said he would when he was campaigning, and even if I had known it, I still would have dismissed  doing that as too stupid to do.  But I was wrong!  Abe went (on just about the very last day of December, when all forecasters had brought their forecasts down to zero) to appease his base and keep his campaign promise.   Big ouch!    I couldn't see Abe doing it because  was inconceivable to me that anyone would do it, so  I wonder if I'm having such a hard time reading DJT for the same reason.  DJT might withdraw from NAFTA to appease his base and keep his campaign promise--just like why Abe went to Yasukuni!   I also wonder if I'm over-correcting and forecasting higher than the consensus because of that past error. A year ago other top forecasters told me that they were not going to forecast on any more questions involving DJT because they considered them/him impossible to forecast.  \"Fools rush in where angels fear to tread.\"  This fool is so wishing she'd not gotten into this question!"], [1333, "2018-07-04T16:17:26Z", [0.03], ""], [47482, "2018-07-04T15:09:43Z", [0.03], "Adjusting down to match my mentors on this question: @pietrokc and @Censusguyz.

On balance, I think the chance of a notice increases somewhat. The tariffs are going to spoil further the not-so-good climate at the NAFTA talks, and reduce the likelihood of completing these talks before the Mexican elections on July 1. Assuming that these are won by the leftist AMLO, will the current Mexican administration even dare to bring a revised NAFTA deal to their Congress in the interim period before the new President gets into office on December 1? I doubt. Sure, it may be possible to conclude a deal that exempts Canada and Mexico from the steel/aluminum tariffs in exchange for concessions on their part. But ratification will probably have to wait the new President of Mexico. Meanwhile, Trump may get impatient and issue the notice to apply pressure. Also, he probably thinks it's a political winner, as it may energize his base for the mid-terms. All in all, still a notice is not very likely - but it's more likely than before the tariffs.

It allows him to seek a simple yes-or-no vote by lawmakers on an updated pact with Mexico and Canada. In exchange, the administration must clear a series of steps designed to build support among politicians.\n. . . \nHere are some steps that must be taken for Congress to approve a trade deal under fast-track authority: The administration must give Congress 90 days\u2019 notification that it plans to sign a deal Once the deal is signed, the U.S. International Trade Commission has 105 days to produce a report on the economic impact The Senate Finance and House Ways and Means committees will likely hold hearings and suggest tweaks, known as \u201cmarkups\u201d After an implementing bill is introduced in the Senate and House, both chambers can take up to 90 days to debate it Talk of putting a new Nafta to a vote in Congress assumes the three countries can even reach an agreement, which is by no means a given. In recent weeks, the three sides have been aiming for a \u201cdeal-in-principle.\u201d None of the countries have clarified what that means, but trade experts speculate it would entail a consensus on the most contentious issues, such as rules for how to count the origin of car parts that qualify for duty-free treatment. Such a deal would be a long way from a formal text that lawmakers can vote on. The wild card is Trump\u2019s threat to withdraw from the original Nafta. Under the pact, any of the three countries can pull out on six-months\u2019 notice. If the president wants to light a fire under Congress, he could sign a withdrawal notice after negotiating an update he likes. That would give legislators a hard six-moth deadline to agree to the updated trade pact.

Most countries alarmed by the threat of tariffs by the U.S. are hedging and preparing by signing new trade deals that are less dependent on the U.S; for example, Mexico was the first country to ratify the most recent version of the TPP. But a likely Morena / Manuel Lopez Obrador election win in the next Mexican political election could escalate trade wars, especially because in a \"war of attrition\", the U.S. may have more to lose. In this scenario, it's difficult to exclude the possibility that in fact, AMLO and Trump could appeal to their respective populist bases by striking a deal that replaces NAFTA, or at least threatening to do so.  https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2018/04/24/an-early-look-at-mexicos-presidential-elections-and-what-a-populist-win-means-for-nafta/ In the case that negotiations become personal and reactive, Trump might easily respond to any slight from AMLO with an immediate notice of intent to withdraw from NAFTA; or alternatively, knowing that this would be an incendiary but potentially advantageous move, AMLO may initiate such a withdrawal first, once again, causing Trump to do the same in \"retaliation\". As time moves along and the Mexican election becomes more informative, the consensus on this forecast will likely become volatile and then slowly decay.

Inside view lowers the odds further in my opinion: Withdrawing from NAFTA will likely deal a significant economic blow to the U.S. Though U.S. has a trade deficit with Canada and Mexico, it still exports large amount of goods produced by politically powerful sectors (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/business/nafta-canada-mexico.html, https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-effect-nafta-farmers/u-s-farmers-have-much-to-lose-if-nafta-deal-collapses-idUSKBN1FH0O0).

Lighthizer said he\u2019s aiming for an agreement that will have broad support in the current Congress, with at least 65 percent of the Senate and House approving the deal. . . .  Mexico plans to respond to the latest U.S. proposals when ministers meet Monday, Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Tuesday.  Lighthizer\u2019s push to hammer out a deal could bump into a difficult reality, as the three countries still haven\u2019t agreed on thorny issues such as rules for car manufacturing in the region. President Trump has threatened to withdraw from NAFTA if he can\u2019t make changes to shrink America\u2019s trade deficit and revive manufacturing jobs.  Speaking earlier on Tuesday, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross cautioned there\u2019s a risk NAFTA negotiations could drag on for months. The three countries could reach a deal in the next few weeks, \u201cor it will take until fall, and who knows what happens then,\u201d according to Ross, who is frequently engaged in the White House\u2019s decisions on trade. \u201cAs you move toward the middle of the year, the political calendar makes it difficult,\u201d he said at a conference in Los Angeles, citing Mexico\u2019s presidential vote in July. But the pace of NAFTA negotiations has accelerated in the past few weeks. Canada\u2019s chief negotiator, Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland, said in late April that talks were in an intensive stage, with technical teams working long hours and weekends to get a deal done. Still, Trump has expressed little urgency to reach an agreement and said last week he wasn\u2019t sure a quick deal would be in America\u2019s interests. Since then, Trump on Monday extended temporary exemptions for Canada and Mexico from U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum. Trump has said he would exclude both countries permanently if they agree to a NAFTA accord to his liking. The new exemption expires June 1.\n~~~~~~~\nhttp://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-05/02/c_137151316.htm \"If we can get a good agreement, I'd like to get it done a week or two after that, if not, then you start to have a problem,\" Lighthizer said at an event hosted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \"If we don't do that, then you're going to run out of the 200 and some days and you're probably voting next year with a different Congress.

In the normal course of things, new NAFTA would be put to a vote in Congress, which would in effect be choosing between old NAFTA and new NAFTA. WH seems scared new NAFTA might not win. By withdrawing, Congress would in effect be voting on new NAFTA or no NAFTA at all. One problem I see with this strategy is that Congress can simply vote to bring old NAFTA back, even after WH withdraws --- right? Or more precisely, they can vote to override the notice of withdrawal. Also, given the extensive news coverage of what's going on with NAFTA --- and the recent repeated headlines of people saying negotiations are going well --- it seems to me that the withdraw-to-get-vote move would be relatively transparent to the public. Then it might be relatively easy to paint Trump as a dictator trying to take choice away from Congress. I guess previous paragraph assumes public is paying attention to these developments. (I've been googling nafta news almost every day for weeks so I'm biased.) Let's look at people who could barely say what NAFTA is, much less what's happening with it. They may have heard one or two headlines that NAFTA negotiations are going well. Then Trump comes on TV and says he's pulling out of NAFTA --- presumably with some kind of speech about how NAFTA is bad, because he can't just come out and say he's doing it to get the vote he wants. Plus he is Trump so he can't just say NAFTA is kind of bad --- he's going to say it's the worst thing since original sin. Then a few weeks or months later he rejoins NAFTA. (It can't be that long because business will get jitters.) Isn't that weird, even to the uninformed person? Finally, even assuming they are willing to go through with all this, the act of publicizing this strategy puts Congress on notice, which lets negotiations ensue --- either Congress believes WH threats and caves before the move needs to be pulled, or WH believes Congress threats and doesn't pull move.

Ms. Kuball said U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has proposed to his Canadian and Mexican counterparts that they announce an agreement in principle by March 31 and ensure a legal scrub of the new agreement is completed by May 1. \"The May 1 deadline to have a finished agreement was based on a number of considerations. First, May 1 is the date when the current Mexican and Canadian exemptions from the steel and aluminum tariffs announced by President Trump earlier in this month expire. That date also assumed importance as the administration wants to have the current Congress vote on the agreement, and Congress may move slowly. Mr. Lighthizer also understood Mexico\u2019s negotiators may have less latitude in the talks with the approach of that country\u2019s presidential elections scheduled for July 1, and provincial elections in Canada may stiffen resolve to oppose U.S. demands that Canada lower barriers to U.S. poultry and dairy products. \"The deadlines proposed by Mr. Lighthizer may be difficult to meet, Ms. Kuball said.

Leaving aside Trump's reported \"enthusiasm\" for the deal, it looks like there would be a serious attempt to resolve the main issues in a freshly-scheduled 8th round of talks in DC in April. The Mexican officials also appear to want this, perhaps scared of the persistent lead of the leftist AMLO in the presidential elections' opinion polls. (I suppose they hope that if the issues are closed, AMLO may choose not to reopen them, while if the negotiations continue, his pre-election rhetorics may force him to take a harder stand.) For a deal \"in principle\" to be reached in April, Mexico and Canada would have to be very flexible, which may indeed be the case if Trump's recent actions scared them. But it won't be easy - I give the deal a chance of some 60%. In any event, a deal in April all but removes the need of a notice. A \"no deal\" scenario is much more uncertain - if good progress will have been achieved, Trump may wait the Mexican elections out; otherwise, the use of the notice as a pressure tool is not dead yet.

Now that it's clear that Canada and Mexico are excluded from the steel & aluminum tariffs, let's think what might be the impact of the tariff saga on the outcome of this question. Trump threatened to impose these tariffs on the US NAFTA partners if no NAFTA deal to his liking is reached - and then backed off. How to read this? On the one hand, Trump did show that he is willing to break - or at least make more costly - established free-trade links. On the other hand, he backed off somewhat under pressure from free-trade Republicans. One way to read this is that Mexico and Canada have to show some more flexibility in the NAFTA talks - to give Trump some victories to ward off bigger disasters. If they go this way, the chance of a notice to withdraw declines. On the other hand, Mexico and Canada may feel emboldened by the support they received from most of the American political class in the tariff discussion and refuse to give in on the substantial issues. This would increase the chance of a notice - as a pressure instrument if nothing more. On the third hand, Trump showed once again his negotiating tactics - throw a big bomb first, alarm everybody, and then scale down the actual policy action. It's not inconceivable he may do the same with a notice to withdraw. But timing would be important here - if it's clear that the NAFTA talks cannot be finished on the original schedule and have to continue after the Mexican elections, will Trump issue the notice before the talks are finished? I think not - such a notice is not a vote-gainer for the Republican party overall (it may energize the anti-trade base, but will repel the business groups, and many Democrats are anti-trade as well). On balance, I still think the most likely scenario is that NAFTA talks continue through October 1 (and probably into 2019, after the new Mexican administration gets into office on Dec 1). But there is a chance that a notice is issued before the deadline, and this chance seems slightly larger than before the tariff episode.

Many other forecasters' comments show they are trying to answer the question \"will the US actually formally withdraw from NAFTA\" (not just provide intent).  There is also the legislation 'NAFTA Implementation Act' that actually implements all the stipulations that keep US commerce in line with the agreement (so, even if the executive branch technically withdrawls the US, it would have no real impact unless Congress changes the law).

Additionally, Trump alone cannot withdraw the US from NAFTA; given the nature of US domestic politics, this caveat makes notice of withdraw even more unlikely. However, a few upcoming events may cause Trump to become impatient and push to withdraw in the next few months. The current round of negotiations is supposed to end in March, and unless negotiations are completed by then or there is significant progress unanimously supported by the US, Mexico, and Canada, it will be difficult to implement reforms. Mexican presidential campaigns begin in March and elections will be held in July, during which time Mexico has said it will not ratify a new agreement. If the current political front-runner is elected, Mexico will likely adopt a stronger stance against Trump on trade. Additionally, notice of intent could be used by the Trump administration as a bargaining chip in negotiations to push concessions from Mexico and Canada.

I originally could see the red meat he'd throw with a notice of NAFTA pullout. But he could do anything and still have that base of his so he needs to look elsewhere to prop up his and Republican numbers. Maybe he's starting to listen to the strategists around him because I'm noticing the Dems are not faring as well on the generic ballot. Perhaps Trumps tweets are fewer and more strategic. He's trying to play the middle with DACA so he can pound the Dems for not biting. If he's listening to strategists, he may just avoid the noisy BS NAFTA notice.\nI'm starting to see other trouble down the line for him with Meuller investigation although I wouldn't put a dime on him getting impeached by the Republican controlled Congress. I think he believes that he's really changed the economy and the stock market and while that's not really true because there is a great deal of lag time on these things (Obama), that doesn't matter. Trumpeting the economy, bonuses from tax reform, etc. is what he needs to claim for 2018. So, giving notice on NAFTA could affect these numbers he touts. Also, I think the Mexican elections in July could result in those running in Mexico to use NAFTA as a political football. Trump wants to keep NAFTA so there's too much risk with that. Basically, I think they will delay negotiations and call it a cooling off period. Not sure how long that will go however. Lastly, Mexico and Canada are not chumps at negotiations and are part of the revived TPP (without the US).

Additionally, with US mid-term elections and Mexico's presidential elections this year, the longer this drags on the higher the risk that NAFTA becomes a punching bag for candidates - https://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanielparishflannery/2018/02/01/will-nafta-survive-2018/#5fb63958605a 2) Canada and Mexico have an increasing number of trade options that don't include the US, and Europe and Asia are happy to take up the slack - http://foreignpolicy.com/2018/01/29/nafta-talks-stalled-as-world-moves-on-without-u-s-lighthizer-freeland/ 3) Interestingly, leading Democrats are beginning to agree with Trump that NAFTA is a bad deal, but in substantially different areas. Although I think that the Democrat argument is more nuanced than simply withdrawing from NAFTA if the US doesn't get the \"best deal,\" I can see the President dropping this context and using it as fodder to say that Dems and GOP both agree that this is a bad deal - https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/02/02/sanders-and-trump-agree-nafta-has-to-change-they-split-on-how-to-fix-it/?utm_term=.55e397b48099"], [38969, "2018-02-03T14:55:42Z", [0.25], "If the US economy continues to grow there will not be any reason to withdraw."], [50577, "2018-02-03T14:31:19Z", [0.75], ""], [45197, "2018-02-03T08:55:04Z", [0.25], "This is a crazy-making question that begs more questions than answers.  On the surface, Trump simply wants to kill NAFTA, because he thinks it's bad for the US economy and calls it a \"bad joke.\" it also has been one of the root causes of displaced Mexican workers and immigration to the United States for 23 years.  Canada thinks he'll pull out.  Yet, economists are more sketchy on the matter, knowing withdrawal would be bad for the economy, and are more likely to predict the opposite.  Confirmation bias? So, what is anybody to make of this?  Do we expect the worst or the best, given what most in the financial world consider an alarmingly stupid policy?  Is Trump just playing hard-ball deal-maker?  Does he really know what he's doing?   Thus, my prediction on this one is based on who has more power, and in this case it's the businesses with a lot at stake. Sure, the President has the constitutional authority to withdraw, but Trump is full of hot air and has limited political influence as a result of his hate and bluster.  Would he be able to unilaterally withdraw without Congress?  Constitutionally, yes, maybe-- but maybe not given a Supreme Court precedent.  I don't care what Trump says about NAFTA-- the business forces of 3 countries won't give this one up without a fight.  Business has too much power.  (And I don't even like NAFTA that much.) Yet, it also seems likely NAFTA could tank anyway, by intent.  Canada just threatened to pull out rather than get a bad deal.  Mexico is pretty much on the same page.  Negotiations around different proposals and issues have been worked out recently, but to what end?  Does any amount of negotiation negate a bad leader who simply wants to do his own bidding?  Is Trump an isolationist or a deal-maker?  What does an isolationist want to do?  Build a wall, cancel all deals, cut ties, end treaties and hole up?  (To my knowledge, this was the Bannon plan...) Anything with Trump is a nasty wildcard, and should probably be avoided on a prediction site the this one if anyone has any sense, but I just feel like throwing my hat in and guessing-- yes guessing-- that negotiations and cooler heads will prevail over the crazy guy with the constitutional authority to tear this thing to shreds.  Yet, I'm not confident enough to put any real staunch numbers behind it... so here we are at 25%.  Let's see how this goes. Still, my gut tells me he's going to pull out and simply be an idiot on an idealistic mission to isolate us and renegotiate everything.

However, the admin pulled out of the Paris Accords and still seems to be making movements to back out of the TPP. I think that determining the actual thought that might go into this decision within the White House is an exercise in a second order of chaos, since Trump himself is a wildcard.  I think the overwhelming sense of intuition is leading me towards weighting the nature of Trump as a wildcard reasonably high. I think cultural strain between the US and Mexico right now is high, which weighs in favor of it happening.

I think this is why the government has already gone to WTO for a number of grievances, and is actively shoring up relations with TPP,  CETA, etc. Mexico: the animosity is their biggest problem going into these negotiations and  insurmountable I think. Also  wages. Likelihood of better wages and more employed workers iseven less than @25%, as US companiesare bing pressured at all levels domestically to show numbers that more US workers have been higher end or domestic wage bills has risen. And, thanks to NAFTA, Mexico has very little gdp generating business (like patents) that is not very tied to US economy.

Trump is correct, that canning NAFTA is best route to better deal for US. Canada and Mexico cannot switch geographic position. However, domestic businesses would face costly short-terms hassles of re-org so they, and other groups, so are lobbying to keep things as they are with better terms.

Mexico and Canada strongly welcomed the hint. This means that the window for serving a notice before Oct 1 is shrinking. (One complication: the next Mexican administration would assume office only on December 1. I don't think the US would want to wait that long, so talks will probably resume before that - not sure how productive they will be before Dec 1). Second, Mexico has indicated some willingness to move toward the US proposals. Specifically, they have proposed that NAFTA is reviewed and revised every 5 years (the US wants automatic termination every 5 years unless the parties agree to extend NAFTA). Regarding the rules of origin in the auto industry (another controversial issue), Mexico can agree to some increase in the regional (North American) content in cars' value from the current 62.5%, although they still think the US-proposed 85% (of which 50 percentage point US content) is unrealistically high. This means that the Jan/Mar talks are likely to be assessed as productive, reducing the probability of a notice.  \n\nTo summarize, I expect the parties to make some progress in the January and March rounds and make encouraging public noises about them, enough for all to convince their domestic constituencies that things are moving in the right direction. Discussions will then resume in late summer/early fall, with an agreement expected in 2019.  What can go wrong with this forecast:\n - First, Mexico may find it hard to show willingness to compromise before the elections. The government candidate for President is a distant third in the opinion polls, and any perception of softness toward the US may not help; \n - Second, if not much progress is made by March, the US may revisit the idea of providing notice as a negotiation tool. If they are going this route, I think they are more likely to do this after the Mexican elections, but this could still be before Oct 1.   \n "], [368, "2018-01-19T19:29:47Z", [0.0], ""], [45467, "2018-01-19T17:00:17Z", [0.34], "It appears that Canada is not taking Trump's threats seriously, and this is showing in the way that they approach the negotiations.

The positions of the US on the one hand and Mexico-Canada on another remain far apart on the substantive issues (rules of origin and sunset clauses forcing automatic renegotiations every five years).\n\n - I think it's highly unlikely that an agreement can be reached by end-March. The US administration then will face a choice between the following options: (1) continue to negotiate after the Mexican elections (July 1) - by far the more likely outcome in my view, especially if Mexico and Canada have shown some flexibility in the Jan-Mar rounds. This keeps all options open without alienating influential pro-NAFTA Republican constituencies. And, for Trump, 2020 is a more important date than 2018 to show that he keeps his promises (assuming he wants to run again). In this case, it's nearly impossible to conclude the new rounds of discussions by Oct 1 - at most, there could be one more round in September, not enough for anything;  (2) Declare the negotiations failed, in which case a notice of intent to withdraw is a must - otherwise, the administration would lose both face and credibility. The notice can also be used as a negotiation device, as others have noted. But to be successful, it needs to be credible, and the timing is a problem here - given the Mexican and the US elections, not much can be accomplished in the 6-month window of the notice, even if the notice itself is delayed by, say, June 2018. But I give this scenario a non-zero probability for two reasons:\n(i) May be the notice can be issued as late as September 2018 - in the eve of renewed negotiations, or after a first (unsuccessful) round. Then there would be enough time, more or less. A risky strategy, but not out of question;\n(ii) An intriguing possibility discussed in a Bloomberg article from Dec 15 (can be easily Googled) is that the administration serves the notice, but Congress does not agree (or just does not raise the import tariffs on Mexico and Canada). This may happen even with the tacit agreement of the administration, again as a tool to apply pressure on Mexico and Canada. The US may view this as having their cake and eating it too - not immediately hurting US businesses benefitting from NAFTA while forcing Mexico and Canada to compromises. Of course, the resulting uncertainty will harm businesses' medium-term plans, but the administration may be gambling that the negotiations can then be closed in a few months.   \n"], [46369, "2018-01-04T21:05:36Z", [0.2], ""], [40642, "2018-01-04T20:42:21Z", [0.01], ""], [46376, "2018-01-04T20:27:05Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2018-01-04T19:27:31Z", [0.02], ""], [42099, "2018-01-04T18:10:24Z", [0.2], ""], [46227, "2018-01-04T15:21:08Z", [0.65], "A notice of intent wouldn't commit the US to withdrawing, but would give the US significant leverage and force Canada and Mexico to the table.

If one googles \"trump nafta\", one finds a barrage of articles against leaving NAFTA from authors and publications everywhere on the political spectrum. I honestly can't think of any group with any amount of political power that actually wants the US to leave NAFTA. This strongly points to it not happening. Trump has talked about NAFTA a great deal, but we've seen again and again that he has no problem, shall we say, refocusing on other issues when one issue doesn't go his way. He abandoned Obamacare repeal very quickly, and who even remembers the wall anymore? Alternatively, he may simply claim victory with NAFTA renegotiations, regardless of how they go. What NAFTA actually consists of is a deeply technical matter; I strongly doubt the median American can explain it any more precisely than \"it's a trade deal with Canada and Mexico\". So it's easy for govt officials to latch on to any changes and call them wins. Who even knows where to look for the losses? I find this scenario the most likely by far. The one way I can see for the question to resolve as \"yes\" is for Trump to provide the withdrawal notice as a negotiating tactic, but then not follow through with it. But all the fundamentals seem so clearly against the US's departure from NAFTA that Mexico & Canada would know it was a bluff, negating its effectiveness. For now I'll go in between the base rate and the crowd, at 10%, which also feels like a reasonable estimate for the probability of bluff I just described. I regard the US actually leaving NAFTA as almost a black swan, with odds at 1% or below.

So far, Trump met with many heads of state, except the President of Mexico. That is negotiation 101 blunder from Mexico which Trump certainly will not make.
