More than a hundred residents of Marawi, on the southern island of Mindanao, have died and 70,000 have fled the town of 200,000 since fighters from the Maute Islamist militant group entered the city and clashed with military and police. \"Precision airstrikes are (being) judiciously used to prevent collateral damage and employed at specific targets of resistance to protect our troops and hasten clearing of the city of terrorist elements who continue to resist,\" military spokesman Brigadier General Restituto Padilla said Tuesday, according to the official Philippine News Agency. The siege on Marawi unfolded as Muslims worldwide began to mark the holy month of Ramadan. Mindanao has a significant Muslim population, though the Philippines is a predominantly Catholic country (para. 1-4). Fighting ongoing Reports suggested the Maute fighters were defending Isnilon Hapilon, a longstanding terrorist leader designated by ISIS as the group's emir for Southeast Asia, after he was cornered by Philippines police and military forces (para. 8). \nFilipino soldiers engage in a firefight with ISIS-linked militants on May 30, 2017, in Marawi in the southern Philippines. \nMilitants' ongoing resistance suggested Hapilon, who has a $5 million FBI bounty on his head, was still in the city, the Philippines military said. \nMore than 80 militants had been killed since fighting began, while 17 soldiers and three police officers had died, Armed Forces of the Philippines spokesman Joar Herrara told CNN. \nPhilippines President Rodrigo Duterte suggested over the weekend that he would be open to tapping nationalist rebel groups, which recently signed peace deals with the government, as reinforcements in the fight against ISIS (para. 8-12).

A Philippines intelligence source said that of the 400-500 marauding fighters who overran Marawi City on the island of Mindanao last Tuesday, as many as 40 had recently come from overseas, including from countries in the Middle East. The source said they included Indonesians, Malaysians, at least one Pakistani, a Saudi, a Chechen, a Yemeni, an Indian, a Moroccan and one man with a Turkish passport. \"IS is shrinking in Iraq and Syria, and decentralizing in parts of Asia and the Middle East,\" said Rohan Gunaratna, a security expert at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. \"One of the areas where it is expanding is Southeast Asia and the Philippines is the center of gravity.\" Mindanao has been roiled for decades by bandits, local insurgencies and separatist movements. But officials have long warned that the poverty, lawlessness and porous borders of Mindanao's predominantly Muslim areas mean it could become a base for radicals from Southeast Asia and beyond, especially as Islamic State fighters are driven out of Iraq and Syria. Although Islamic State and groups affiliated to the movement have claimed several attacks across Southeast Asia in the last two years, the battle in Marawi City was the first long drawn-out confrontation with security forces. On Tuesday, a week after the fighting began, the government said it was close to retaking the city. Last year, Southeast Asian militants fighting for Islamic State in Syria released a video urging their countrymen to join the cause in the southern Philippines or launch attacks at home rather than attempting to travel to Syria. Jakarta-based terrorism expert Sidney Jones passed to Reuters some recent messages in a chat-room of the Telegram app used by Islamic State supporters (para. 1-10). Allard, T. (2017).

In a video apparently taken under duress by militants, Father Teresito Suganob said his captors wanted the military to withdraw its forces from Marawi, where Islamic militants still hold pockets of territory after a week of gun-battles with the army. A colleague of Suganob confirmed to The Associated Press that the man in the video is the priest. It was not clear when the video was taken or who released it online, and whether Suganob believed what he was saying or was forced to say it. \"We want to live another day, we want to live another month,\" Suganob said, standing in front of debris and partially burned buildings. Directing his remarks to Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, he said, \"We want to live few years and in your generosity, Mr. President, in your heart, we know you can make something (happen)\" (para. 1-4).

Inasmuch as The Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines, clearly shows the authority to declare martial law, for the protection of the citizens and government. The information and probability exists absence of the legal rationale set forth in the Constitution, clearly these options should have existed and presented to the group forecast as probable outcomes.  Nonetheless, no prior definition or clarifications were presented in the forecast to cover:  The 1935 Constitution\u2019s provisions on martial the acts of ISIS relative to invasion, insurrection, to protect the Government and civilian populous from such attacks. Yet History show how that legal authority has exists misused in the past, clearly the current situation exists as the rationale of the inclusion in the Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines, as a protective measure.  References historical Referencing The 1935 Constitution\u2019s provisions on martial law only read that: \u201cIn case of invasion, insurrection, or rebellion, or imminent danger thereof, when the public safety requires it, he may suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, or place the Philippines or any part thereof under martial law.\u201d In which provisions that President Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law through Proclamation No. 1081 on September 21, 1972. Thereafter, President Marcos removed from the civilian courts their authority to decide upon certain crimes and transferred jurisdiction over these crimes to military tribunals he himself had created. Martial law was not formally lifted until January 17, 1981, through Proclamation No. 2045. Legal scholars have strongly contended that it continued even beyond that because President Marcos had by then also acquired legislative powers and, at its heart, martial law is the concentration of governmental powers in the hands of the Executive.

In the United States, martial law must be ordered by the president as commander-in-chief and must be limited to the duration of the warfare or emergency. In many foreign countries, martial law has become a method to establish and maintain dictatorships either by military leaders or politicians backed by the military.

He said dozens of gunmen occupied city hall, a hospital and a jail and burned a Catholic church, a jail, a college and some houses in a bold attack that killed at least two soldiers and a police officer and wounded 12 others. Several militants were killed in the fighting in Marawi city in Lanao del Sur province, about 830 kilometers (520 miles) south of Manila, but others continued to lay siege to the largely Muslim city of more than 200,000 people, officials said, adding that power was cut in the city in a chaotic scene.\n\"The whole of Marawi city is blacked out, there is no light, and there are Maute snipers all around,\" Lorenzana said in the news conference in Moscow, which was broadcast live in the Philippines (para. 1-5). Duterte\u2019s martial law declaration will help government forces carry out searches and arrests and detain rebel suspects more quickly, Lorenzana said. He said offensives would also be staged in other southern provinces plagued by extremist groups. Despite the moves, he said the government remains in control of the situation in Marawi city and other security trouble spots in the south (para.7).\nMilitary chief of staff Gen. Eduardo Ano said the fighting broke out in Marawi when troops attacked a hideout for Muslim extremist leader Isnilon Hapilon. Hapilon reportedly has been chosen to lead an Islamic State group branch in Southeast Asia and is on the U.S. Department of Justice list of most-wanted terrorists worldwide, with a reward of up to $5 million for his capture. An Arabic-speaking Islamic preacher known for his expertise in commando assaults, he pledged allegiance to the IS group in 2014, according to security officials. Ano said Hapilon, who is still recovering from wounds sustained in a military airstrike in January, and more than a dozen of his men summoned reinforcements from their allies in the Maute militant group. Ano said nearly 50 gunmen in all managed to enter the city.\nOne group of about 20 gunmen took position in a hospital, where they raised a black Islamic State group-style flag at the gate, and 10 other militants went near a provincial jail where troops and policemen engaged them in fighting, he said. Troops sealed off major entry and exit points to prevent Hapilon from escaping, Ano told The Associated Press by telephone from Moscow, where he was accompanying Duterte (para. 7-12).

The bank expects the Philippines\u2019 gross domestic product (GDP) growth to land near the middle of the government target range of 6.5 to 7.5 percent for 2017. Additionally, it is confident that the government can sustain economic gains such that these will be more inclusive, or be felt by a bigger segment of the population.\nThe World Bank\u2019s April 2017 Philippine Economic Update report forecasts a 6.9-percent GDP growth for this year and 2018. Growth is seen slightly slowing to 6.8 percent in 2019. The World Bank\u2019s forecasts for 2018 and 2019 may be below the government\u2019s target range of 7-8 percent from 2018 to 2022, but will continue to be among the highest globally.\nHowever, there is a caveat. World Bank Philippines lead economist Birgit Hansl told a media briefing that the lender was bullish on the Philippines given the Duterte administration\u2019s commitment to ramp up public infrastructure spending, which is key to sustaining the country\u2019s growth momentum through 2018 and reinforcing business and consumer confidence. Hansl noted that the implementation of the planned infrastructure projects could generate positive spillover effects for the rest of the economy, spurring additional business activity, accelerating job creation, and ultimately contributing to higher household consumption and poverty reduction.\nWorld Bank Philippines country director Mara K. Warwick had already noted that strong growth in recent years was accompanied by job generation and a declining number of people living in extreme poverty, as well as economic growth becoming \u201cmore inclusive.\u201d Indeed, unemployment fell to a historic low of 4.7 percent in 2016 as 1.4 million net jobs were created, while poverty incidence among Filipinos dropped to 21.6 percent in 2015 from 25.2 percent in 2012, or equivalent to 1.8 million Filipinos lifted out of the poverty line during the three-year period.\nBut not everything is rosy moving forward. As former economic planning chief Cielito Habito has pointed out in his columns in the Inquirer, there are dark clouds over the economy. He cited the rise in inflation to more than two-year highs, persistent unemployment, and slowing economic growth. Then there is the uncertainty about the global economy, particularly that of the United States given President Donald Trump\u2019s protectionist tendencies.\nThe crucial thing now is for Congress to pass the comprehensive tax reform program of the Duterte administration that is needed to help finance an ambitious infrastructure plan. The government intends to ramp up infrastructure spending to the tune of P8 trillion over the next five years, seeking to spur development and ease traffic congestion by building new roads, bridges, railways and airports. These projects, in turn, will generate jobs to address the unemployment problem.\nIn the meantime, the Philippines can still bank on two growth drivers\u2014remittances from overseas Filipinos and earnings from the BPO sector. Cash sent home by Filipinos living and working abroad reached a record $26.9 billion in 2016, up 5 percent from $25.61 billion in 2015. Last January, the figure rose 8.6 percent to $2.17 billion\u2014the first time that cash remittances exceeded the $2-billion mark at the start of the year. Revenues from the BPO sector have been projected to overtake remittances from overseas Filipinos this year. In 2016, the industry generated over a million direct jobs and more than $20 billion in revenues.\nSo long as the billions of dollars from overseas Filipinos continue coming in and the billions of dollars earned by BPO workers remain here, consumer spending will sustain economic growth. These will augment household consumption and ensure the continued expansion of other economic segments, among them the property and retail sectors. As it is, the economic view now should be one of guarded optimism.\" Inquirer, April 16, 'Duterte Mideast visits yield $925M in deals, agreements': http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/889577/duterte-mideast-visits-yield-925m-in-deals-agreements Good insight:\nThe Rappler, April 16, 'Where does the military stand with Duterte?': http://www.rappler.com/thought-leaders/166768-military-stand-duterte-commander-in-chief\nClips from Rappler article:\n\"2. What if Duterte declares martial law?\nThe President will not declare martial law nationwide if he thinks and feels the military will be half-hearted about it. This is not the officer corps of a bygone era. It has 3 decades of indoctrination on civilian supremacy over the military (rule of law, non-partisanship, human rights). Its senior members entered the institution just as Ferdinand Marcos was on his knees, about to be booted out of power. They\u2019re on social media, they\u2019re connected with the rest of the world, they\u2019ve seen leaders come and go.\nAnd in the battlefield such as Sulu, they can see through the BS \u2013 because they know from the trenches that the Abu Sayyaf is ultimately not, clich\u00e9 as it may sound, a military problem.\n\u201cHow do you solve a problem like Sulu?\u201d asked an Army colonel who, at the time of our interview, was with fellow elite forces who had just finished their assignment in the troubled island province. \u201cKill all politicians? Provide injectables to women so they don\u2019t have to give birth to more Abu Sayyaf?\u201d\nThey know the utter helplessness of the situation in Sulu, where, in the words of an Army captain, every soldier \u2013 \u201chis fatigues, his boots, his equipment\u201d \u2013 is a \u201cwalking peso sign\u201d and where kidnappers are the biggest employers and providers in a land ravaged by corrupt politicians.\nThis is not to romanticize the AFP as an ultra-professional institution that\u2019s beyond temptation or abuse. But Duterte will have to do more than visit dead soldiers\u2019 wake to earn blind loyalty from the senior officer corps. \u201cHe can charm the AFP over time but not overnight,\u201d quipped a former chief of staff as he reminded us of Hugo Chavez and the late Venezuelan leader\u2019s tumultuous ties with his own army, which he eventually got to control. (READ: Duterte to military: I need you in leading the country)\nFor now, the military hierarchy has perspective that their commander-in-chief sometimes lacks. Left unchecked, however, and given the power dynamic in an institution that's mandated to obey orders, the officer corps will in due time learn to speak Duterte's language, embrace his shoot-before-thinking style, believe that the Abu Sayyaf can be crushed by brute force alone, accept drugs as a national security problem, and probably even be convinced that military control of the bureaucracy would finally make change come.\nBetween now and that time, however, is a lot of unpredictable factors under a constantly vexed presidency. 3. What would make the military withdraw support from Duterte?\nThe answer is a no-brainer: the civilians. Quite frankly, it\u2019s fruitless to even think about it now. \"We don't disagree that there's a problem, that he is somewhat a problem,\" says a general. \"But he is the commander-in-chief.\"\nThe military will know when it\u2019s needed. Or when it\u2019s not.\nThe AFP, after all, has brought down two previous commanders-in-chief \u2013 Ferdinand Marcos and Joseph Estrada \u2013 and mounted botched mutinies against two female presidents: Corazon Aquino and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.\nIt waited for decades before it decided to move against Marcos. Already politicized, it didn\u2019t have that patience with Estrada, whom it helped oust barely two years into his presidency.\nBut those were different times.\nThis is a leader and commander-in-chief who had seen those times but whose presidency has been shaped by the vast and fast changes of the modern world.\nWill the military be swept away by the populist wave that's weaponized by an online movement?

There's also the question of what kind of martial law? the one with basis in Philippine constitution? or something else altogether since some of the his supporters have already been floating the idea of a \"revolutionary government.\" and not to mention, the prez mentioned it himself during the campaign.\nhttp://newsinfo.inquirer.net/716664/duterte-eyes-revolutionary-government But to simplify it, let us go strictly on what the constitution says. let me quote it here:\n\"SECTION 18. The President shall be the Commander-in-Chief of all armed forces of the Philippines and whenever it becomes necessary, he may call out such armed forces to prevent or suppress lawless violence, invasion or rebellion. In case of invasion or rebellion, when the public safety requires it, he may, for a period not exceeding sixty days, suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus or place the Philippines or any part thereof under martial law. \" I'm not a lawyer, but if my understanding is correct the only legal grounds for the president to declare the martial law is either A. Invasion or B. Rebellion in which, arguably is very vague.  Here's the interesting stuff, an impeachment complain against the president was filed before the House of Representatives last week \nhttp://cnnphilippines.com/news/2017/03/16/impeachment-complaint-vs-Duterte.html and surely enough, have already spooked the president's ardent supporters in the lower house by blasting the Vice President who timely enough had a video message to UN\nhttp://www.philstar.com/headlines/2017/03/17/1682065/speaker-alvarez-mulls-impeachment-rap-vs-robredo I even saw things from those \"fake news\" sites and the administration's mouth pieces calling the VP among other things a traitor, destabilizer[sic] and the likes. Huh, destabilization plot against the president? wouldn't that fit in rebellion? \nand oddly enough, president himself keeps mind conditioning or rather, saying to the public that there's a destabilization plot against him, from drug lords, to mining firms.\nhttp://newsinfo.inquirer.net/880305/duterte-mining-firms-funding-oppositions-destabilization-plot But I'm afraid it has become too long and convoluted So to simplify it, It's very unlikely that the prez will declare a martial law under the auspices of the current Constitution but in the event that he does, based on the votes he had when the Lower House passed the Death Penalty bill and still has the same support base by then. it will easily be approved by the Congress if the Senate's \"Supermajority\" holds.

In a pastoral letter published in February, church leaders denounced Duterte\u2019s campaign as a \u201creign of terror\u201d against the poor.\nEmboldened by their bishops\u2019 stance, priests, nuns and missionaries are also taking a stand, offering sanctuary to fearful witnesses, paying for funerals and organizing rallies. Religious leaders who once supported the president are turning their backs on him, potentially hurting his political appeal.\nAt stake are the lives of thousands and the credibility of an institution that has long been at the heart of Philippine life. Religious leaders helped to topple the dictator Ferdinand Marcos in 1986 and have since led campaigns for environmental and civil rights. \nYet many see the role of the Catholic Church receding. Critics, including Duterte, accuse church leaders of corruption. The bishops have abandoned their role as a national conscience, allying themselves instead with the oligarchic ruling class, their critics say. \nSome priests, including the Rev. Joel Tabora, who heads a university in Duterte\u2019s home town, initially backed the president because he had vowed to return power to the ordinary Filipino by forcefully tackling crime.\nLast month, with evidence of police impunity mounting, Tabora wrote a letter condemning the president. \u201cMy vote for Rodrigo Roa Duterte was a vote for him as president of the Philippines. It was not a vote for him as God. Nor a vote for him as the Evil One,\u201d Tabora wrote.\nBut Duterte delights in dancing with the devil. When the bishops denounced the killing spree, he did not repent. \u201cI will go to hell,\u201d he told his countrymen. \u201cCome join me.\u201d Comments: The Catholic Church stirs to life. Still carries a lot of weight with the people. Need to see how this will develop over the next 30 days.

Since 1952, CIA, and now the Intelligence Community, have provided presidential candidates and presidents-elect with intelligence briefings during their campaigns and transitions. These briefings have helped presidents be as well informed as possible on international developments from the day they take office. Getting To Know the President by John Helgerson describes the important process of information sharing between the Intelligence Community and the chief executive. First published in 1996 and now revised and updated to include accounts of intelligence support to candidates and presidents-elect in the three elections between then and 2004, Helgerson\u2019s study provides unique insights into the mechanics and content of the briefings, the interaction of the participants, and the briefings\u2019 effect on the relationships presidents have had with their intelligence services. His observations on how and what to brief during the campaign and transition periods are essential reading for members of the community charged with that responsibility in the future and seeking to learn from the best practices of their predecessors. In addition to their central, substantive purpose, these briefings usually have also served as the IC\u2019s introduction to the \u201cFirst Customer,\u201d the individual who, more than any other, determines what place intelligence will have in the national security hierarchy. They have been crucial in giving an early sense of the personalities of the candidates and presidents-elect, their knowledge of world affairs, and their views of how intelligence and the IC can best support national security decision-making."], [4273, "2017-02-01T14:48:46Z", [0.23, 0.12, 0.65], ""], [29695, "2017-02-01T12:53:15Z", [0.04, 0.0, 0.96], ""], [691, "2017-01-31T22:12:15Z", [0.04, 0.0, 0.96], "What he has now, and is building toward more of, is in practice virtually indistinguishable from martial law.

It is exceedingly more likely that a declaration of martial law would happen not as a consequence of Duterte needing to arrogate more power to himself (which he would need extra-constitutional measures to maintain), but as a result of renewed violence and lawlessness.  In 2009, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo placed the province of Maguindanao under martial law after election related violence saw the massacre of many civilians, allowing her to move against local oligarchs, the Amapatuan clan. She subsequently lifted the declaration a week later, without Congress needing to debate it.  http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/178575/news/nation/arroyo-declares-martial-law-in-maguindanao-province Factors against a declaration of Martial Law: In September 2016, Duterte declared a state of national security, allowing him to deploy troops to do police duties: http://time.com/4479616/rodrigo-duterte-philippines-obama-davao-blast/ Under the Filipino constitution the only way this differs from martial law is that there is no suspension of the writ of habeas corpus. However notably GMA's 2009 declaration came even when a state of emergency was in effect indefinitely.  The ability to deploy troops for police duties nationally would mean it is less likely that a Duterte presidency would require a state of martial law to achieve its aims. These powers have already been used to deploy additional troops in ARMM.  Factors for a declaration of martial law: Possible sources of renewed violence may include : - renewed Islamist violence if the government is unable to quell the Abu Sayyaf Group despite the use of troops under the current declaration of emergency. A general had previously mentioned to Reuters that a declaration of martial law was needed to fix the problem after the kidnapping of foreign nationals in the Southern Philippines:\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-militants-canada-idUSKCN0Z11CE - if current peace talks with the Communist insurgents fail, and there is renewed violence by the communists to renew the revolution - If there is a coup by AFP personnel unhappy with either the Duterte's administrations inability to deliver on widely promised pay increases and/or the rapid foreign policy realignment with China All of these events would increase the chances of a declaration of martial law over at least some part of the Philippines"], [691, "2016-11-03T20:17:27Z", [0.05, 0.0, 0.95], ""], [368, "2016-11-03T19:32:51Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [593, "2016-11-03T15:12:18Z", [0.15, 0.05, 0.8], ""], [593, "2016-11-03T15:11:33Z", [0.2, 0.0, 0.8], ""], [29648, "2016-11-03T06:39:12Z", [0.02, 0.0, 0.98], ""], [368, "2016-11-02T21:00:50Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [691, "2016-11-02T18:53:02Z", [0.05, 0.0, 0.95], ""], [691, "2016-11-01T18:59:08Z", [0.05, 0.0, 0.95], ""], [506, "2016-11-01T05:48:58Z", [0.04, 0.02, 0.94], ""], [29849, "2016-11-01T03:45:01Z", [0.2, 0.05, 0.75], ""], [29891, "2016-11-01T01:21:08Z", [0.55, 0.4, 0.05], ""], [368, "2016-10-31T20:25:36Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [691, "2016-10-31T19:46:25Z", [0.05, 0.0, 0.95], ""], [601, "2016-10-31T16:58:03Z", [0.0, 0.06, 0.94], ""], [368, "2016-10-30T22:22:33Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [691, "2016-10-30T18:58:17Z", [0.07, 0.0, 0.93], ""], [29598, "2016-10-30T13:35:44Z", [0.03, 0.0, 0.97], ""], [29856, "2016-10-30T08:22:12Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [4139, "2016-10-30T04:28:02Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "He would have to cuss to do this and God has ordered him (while flying home from China) not to cuss anymore.
