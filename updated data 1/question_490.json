I see only a few situations where attacks or confrontations are posible, however I do not see any of these resulting in a U.S. casualty. Situation 1: Confrontation with Iran: Confrontations between Iranian fast attack craft and U.S. warships are not uncommon, but have not resulted in a shooting incident thus far. While the Iranian Revolutionary Guards ' Navy does have a policy of provoking the U.S. Navy, they have shown no intention to cause casualties, only going so far as to arrest U.S. sailors that drifted into Iranian territorial waters. Both navies are professional forces who understand the boundaries of protocol, and the re-election of the moderate Rouhani likely means that provocations will not be encouraged in any case. Situation 2: Land-based attacks- It is possible but unlikely that attacks from land-based anti-ship missiles could be directed at U.S. warships, but the Houthi attack on the USS Mason illustrates how unlikely these are to cause a casualty. The Houthi attack on the Mason failed to connect, indicating a failure in Houthi operational expertise or weapons capability, and/or the superiority of U.S. countermeasures. The only likely actor to successfully attack a USN ship in this manner would be a state actor, and this is extremely unlikely as it is sure to spark significant retaliation. The same logic can be applied to air attack. Situation 3: Terror bomb attacks in port/at sea- This is probably the likeliest attack method to cause casualties similar to the USS Cole bombing in 2000. However, I believe it safe to assume that the Cole bombing has changed USN policy to the point where this method would not work again. A similar situation with an even less likelihood of success could happen at sea. Situation 4: Pirates/Other irregular fast attack craft-  This method of attack is unlikely to succeed for reasons above.

Such an action against Iran might mute the criticism of the neocons over the Russia allegations.

While the IRGC likes to keep things interesting with the USN, both sides recognize that a provocation resulting in use of force would have negative results. This isn't to say that the IRGC will stop harassing USN vessels, but that it is something they consider when they approach USN vessels. Should the IRGC actually decide to provoke the USN, it's still a low likelihood of a lethal attack, as USN vessels are sufficiently protected from small arms, and the use of larger weapons like missiles or rockets begins to get into the tactics and doctrine of the USN. I'm confident that, with the exception of a few rare scenarios, attacks would probably not be lethal (assuming lethal means the death of at least one US sailor). I also don't think the attempts at missile/rocket attacks against USN vessels by Houthi rebels will result in fatalities. These bodies of water are known to be in active conflict areas, and the USN doesn't transit them ignorant of the threats. So they will be ready for provocation as soon as the enter the operating area.

While the USN should be cued to a drone vessel, especially operating at lower speeds, floating mines, especially at night, present a greater threat to the vessels. Again, they transit at higher readiness levels, but it's the unsuspecting nature of mines that cause me to be concerned about the threat.
