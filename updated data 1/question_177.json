Always looking for an easy way to skim accuracy points.  After having gone through in some detail, I'm not sure consensus is actually all that far off. The race has clearly tightened, but Feingold looks to be a very strong favorite, and most of the trends seem to favor him more than Johnson. 1) Feingold has been ahead in every single poll in the race but one - http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/senate/wi/wisconsin_senate_johnson_vs_feingold-3740.html#polls . It's true his lead has been narrowing, but it looks like he's still decently ahead w/ 3 wks to go. 2)  There are two debates - one just happened, and headline was \"Johnson stands by Trump\" ... not good.  http://www.startribune.com/johnson-feingold-to-debate-in-tightening-senate-race/397083991/ And http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/10/14/johnson-feingold-clash-first-debate/92090700/ 3) The reality is, this is going to be a turn-out game, and on this front I expect Feingold will have the edge over Johnson.  a) Clinton has been up in every poll in the state so far: http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/wi/wisconsin_trump_vs_clinton-5659.html#polls . I'd expect as well that the lead has widened in the last wk, as it has everywhere else in country.  b) In Johnson's favor though, unlike the rest of the country, in wisconsin the \"ground game\" (as measured by field offices), is pretty evenly matched (http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-clinton-field-offices/).  And those offices are apparently focused on him not Trump (according to article). He's an incumbent w/ a real organization and resources in a seat I'm sure the R's desperately want to hold on to. Johnson is clearly outperforming Trump, he has the resources he needs, and the race has tightened -- obviously he COULD win.  There is one more debate left, and a few wks for him to change the story from being all about Trump.   I'd put Trump's odds of carrying the state at ~5%. I'll give Johnson 2x better chance than Trump (so 10% chance).  "], [14253, "2016-10-15T04:57:36Z", [0.44], "Coming in at 44. Is there something I am missing?

Outside View:\nPredictIt: 17%\nPredictwise: 30%\nAverage outside view: 24% Polling:\nFeingold leads by an average of 11% in polls, last 2 polls have him up by 9% and 13% respectively (http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-wisconsin-senate-johnson-vs-feingold). Feingold has been ahead since the start of the year (by around 7% in January). The polls are therefore not good for Ron Johnson. Feingold is also consistently reaching 50% with only a small amount of undecided (likely to reflect that both candidates are fairly well-known with voters having already made up their minds). \nOverall: The polls at this stage (and for most of the year) are very bad for Johnson, he is a long way behind and seems to have little incumbency advantage. The only question is the amount of time left in the race, however Johnson will have to begin making up ground quickly. 30% Money/Campaign quality:\nIn February the two candidates had a similar amount of money on hand (http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/big-names-filling-ron-johnsons-russ-feingolds-coffers-b99672922z1-369600651.html) however Johnson may have some advantage in PAC contributions (not sure how much difference this makes) and Feingold outraised Johnson up to April (http://fox6now.com/2016/04/12/ron-johnson-outraised-by-russ-feingold-emboldened-by-primary-results/). \nOverall: As usual this is fairly even with no real advantage either way Candidate quality:\nBoth candidates are quite well-known (ie. the challenger is not some untested campaigner). Johnson has higher unfavourables than Feingold (http://www.americansunitedforchange.org/page/-/WisconsinResults616.pdf) but this is not particularly surprising as an incumbent.\nOverall: Again these are two fairly strong candidates who are unlikely to damage themselves during the campaign so call it a wash National effect:\nThe national election is likely to have an impact on this race. Trump seems particularly unpopular in Wisconsin (he lost to Ted Cruz convincingly during the primary). We known that down-ticket races are becoming increasingly nationalised and even more so during presidential cycles (http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/the-2014-senate-elections-were-the-most-nationalized-in-decades/). Again, I think the impact of Trump can be overstated and its possible for some Republican incumbents to hold their own (Rob Portman in Ohio for example). However, Trump is down significantly to Clinton in general election polls (http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/wisconsin/) with large disapproval ratings. All the evidence then suggests that Trump is and will likely continue to be a drag on Johnson\u2019s chances. The one upside for Johnson in this area is that it is unlikely that Trump can fall much lower in Wisconsin, in a sense this may be the lowest point for Johnson\u2019s chances, the question is whether he can improve them at all.\nOverall: -5% Current Prediction: 25% If this election were being held a month today then the prediction would likely be closer to 95% (a 10 point gap is just that bad), but the main variable here is time. There is still time for Johnson to drag it back and indeed it seems likely that he will eventually narrow the gap at least a little bit. Clearly if polling evidence (either local or national) begins to change then the prediction will, but if a sizeable gap remains then it will be very hard for Johnson to win. I\u2019m also interested in the discrepancy between my prediction (25% likelihood), which is in line with 538\u2019s early prediction (15% likelihood), and the classification of the race as a toss-up by Cook Political. I think the difference stems from my polling-centric approach and their more fundamental-centric approach. They clearly see a Republican incumbent in a swing-state as generally having a good chance. I\u2019m open to this approach (and can definitely see how I might be too low of Johnson\u2019s chances) but I think the evidence (at this point) is just too weighted in favour of Feingold. Will keep a close eye on this race though.

His current legislative proposal is a good example. What might sound good to a naive accountant as an efficiency measure (\"the bill would improve federal property management and establish a board to reduce the size of the government's property inventory\"), will more than likely be converted into an efficient vehicle for sweetheart deals by the ravenous hounds in DC. One need only to look back a bit to see how the disposition of federal property went after the Conrail bustout, er bankruptcy, and the S&L \"resolutions.\" If I'm not mistaken, a particularly sweet parcel from the Conrail divestiture ended up with Donald Trump. To cobble together these proposals into a single bill is just so mediocre. Any number of the more reasonable items could be added as an amendment to any other bill. In fact, Johnson would be better served just taking that Social Security Administration death master file proposal and offering it up as an amendment to every single bill he can.

And he emphasized that he was not alone. \u201cAll the donors I\u2019ve talked to have said they want to sit out the presidential and just focus on the Senate and House,\u201d Mr. Hoffman said. \"Ray Washburne, a Republican fund-raiser from Dallas who also previously served as a national committee finance chairman, said, \u201cThere\u2019s a big switch to doing the Senate races and trying to hold onto the Senate.\u201d \"Mr. Washburne said Mr. Trump, who has relied on mostly small-dollar contributors in addition to about $36 million of his own money, showed no sign of being prepared for the fund-raising demands of a presidential general election. \u201cThe Trump group has done nothing about putting together a finance team at all,\u201d he said.  . . .  even as donors have asked him . . . how they could help Mr. Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t even know who the hell to tell them to call,\u201d Mr. Washburne said. \"This sort of unease about Mr. Trump, along with the dislike many of the party\u2019s business-oriented donors have for the hard-line Mr. Cruz, has prompted the R.N.C. to begin privately assuring donors that it will create a so-called Senate Trust fund.
