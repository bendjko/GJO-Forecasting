And only later, richer member states would agree to put their money in common funds to shield deposits and lenders from future failures. An initial version of the summit conclusions, circulated among EU diplomats and seen by Reuters, said new risk reduction measures were already approved and paved the way for more risk sharing.In November, the European Commission proposed new capital rules for the bloc\u2019s lenders, introducing in the EU stricter standards agreed at international level meant to make banks safer.But Germany and the Netherlands said the new measures were not enough to reduce risks and urged stricter requirements. They opposed the initial draft conclusions and successfully pushed for amending the text, two EU officials told Reuters. Officials said the fragility of the banking sector in Italy, where the country\u2019s third largest lender Monte dei Paschi di Siena has been entangled for months in attempts to close a big capital shortfall, has made Berlin even less keen to agree on plans to share risks.\nhttps://www.euractiv.com/section/euro-finance/news/germany-blocks-small-progress-on-banking-union-at-eu-summit/"], [1034, "2016-12-18T08:32:46Z", [0.0], ""], [31521, "2016-12-17T16:32:40Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-12-17T13:13:27Z", [0.01], ""], [1034, "2016-12-17T06:24:14Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-12-16T18:20:23Z", [0.01], ""], [28091, "2016-12-16T16:41:33Z", [0.01], ""], [31496, "2016-12-16T08:07:58Z", [0.05], "Extremely low probability event.

In several countries, private debts arising from a property bubble were transferred to sovereign debt as a result of banking system bailouts and government responses to slowing economies post-bubble.

(Banks is some \"safe\" countries might be a higher risk than the voters think, but the voters are right to believe that the \"safe\" countries do have national balance sheets that could bail out depositors). \nAnother complication is that an EDIS could be for only banks in the Euro Zone or for all banks in the EU. It would seem very unlikely that post Brexit vote an EDIS that included the UK would be proposed. \nThe actual question concerns not the EU Commission or  EU Council of Ministers, but only the EU Parliament.
