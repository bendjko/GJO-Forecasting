Jinping has placed himself in a position that allows for all kinds of future political scenarios that would be impossible under Jiang Zemin, whose power stemmed from corruption and kleptocracy.  \nAlready, Chinese scholars have suggested the possibility of China\u2019s taking on a presidential system of governance.\nIn November, the Xi leadership rolled out a pilot program for a new state anti-corruption body that answers to the Chinese legislature, and not the executive branch. Having this body answerable to the legislature may anticipate a change in the structure of the Chinese regime, with the Party no longer being in charge of everything.\nIf Xi takes the anti-corruption campaign to its logical conclusion, the inadvertent outcome might be a post-communist China.\" Comments: An eventual end to the Politburo?

Xi also appears to be using the campaign, which is very popular with the Chinese people, to eliminate the faction of Jiang Zemin, the Party elder responsible for fostering pervasive corruption in China.\nWang was placed as head of the anti-corruption agency in 2012, and has overseen the arrest of more than a million officials\u2014more than 150 of whom were high-ranking Party cadres in the government, state-run enterprises, and the military.\nOfficials are said to prefer meeting \u201cthe Devil\u201d rather than Wang, a gaunt-looking man with a steely gaze.

Or the physical manifestation of the power struggle between President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang?\nIt's impossible to say for sure. China's political decisions are rarely transparent and whether this was a move by President Xi Jinping to move someone into a position of power who shares his view of the economy, we'll probably never know.\nAnd there's an argument that as Mr Lou turns 66 next month, enforced retirement beckoned anyway.\nBut what many China observers are saying is that President Xi is consolidating his power ahead of next year's party congress - and while he does that, his focus on reforming the economy may not be topmost on his mind.\" Comments: Xi appears to be a patient man.

The anti-corruption campaign is essentially a political purge to re-establish the internal control of the authoritarian party.\"\n\"However, there is no evidence that suggests the incumbent top leaders are providing shelters for their factional members. In other words, most factions within CCP are taking the same side as Xi Jinping in the anti-corruption campaign and hence the intra-elite struggle in the top CCP has been limited. ...  So what exactly is the threat? In this article we propose that the way some specific factions selected and cultivated members has threatened the stability of the Party\u2019s autocracy, which is the real reason why Xi\u2019s anti-corruption campaign can obtain support from others in the top leadership ... By looking into the investigation decisions, we found that city leaders promoted via unhealthy channels, especially through tolerating local corruptions are more likely to be investigated. A quick glance does suggest that the anti-corruption campaign seems like a crackdown on certain factions.

The expected elite turnover must be maintained one way or another\u2014if the 68 age limit is scrapped, for example, other rules must be established to ensure orderly and expected exits from power. Failing this, changes may be unacceptable to Party elites and the rank and file, and serious institutional failures may lead to paralysis and breakdown of the system as well as a legitimacy crisis. On the other hand, Xi and the fifth generation of leaders also have a chance to improve and consolidate the leadership succession process by establishing more explicit and more binding rules regarding exit, selection, and transition. For example, the straw-poll element in the selection of new leaders can become more institutionalized and even turned into a formal poll. Age limits can be turned into term limits, which are more institutionalized in nature. More institutional space can be created for officials who can no longer serve in leadership posts, such as allowing retired leaders to serve in think tanks. The various Party institutions such as the Party congress, the Central Committee, the Politburo, and the various Leadership Small Groups can be given more clearly defined roles and powers.

There has been an over production of material that has led to over construction and  unsold cheaper goods that has pressured an all ready weakening economy. Over production has led to graft. \nSome data has been skewed and over valued. Employee tells manager that production was A and manager tells director that production was B and director tells regional director that production was C and so forth. All are given kickback with the least amount going to the employee  and the government publishes the skewed data for investors. This is why Xi has arrested people on all levels. But also, if a person was an associate of someone who was arrested, particularly a business associate to someone who was an arrested government official, the business associate was probably arrested, unless he or she gave evidence of others who may have been corrupt, and given another sentence or excused. \nBut the arrests also gives more power to Xi by removing his enemies or opposition, As the economy slides, the Chinese leadership needs a pharmowitnessed kos, and more are being arrested and it will continue into the politburo once his or her supporters are arrested or too afraid to support the arrested official.

Hu Jintao was 50 upon his appointment to the PSC at the 14th Party Congress in 1992. Xi Jinping was 54 and Li Keqiang was 52 at their appointment to the PSC at the 17th Party Congress in 2007.[5] At the same time, since the 16th Party Congress in 2002, PSC members who were 68 or older at the time of a Party Congress have retired without exception. This has been known as the rule of qi-shang, ba-xia (\u4e03\u4e0a\u516b\u4e0b; lit. \"seven up, eight down\"), referring to the fact that if a PSC member is 68 or older at the time of a party congress, he must retire, but if he is 67 or younger, he may still enter the committee.\u00bb\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politburo_Standing_Committee_of_the_Communist_Party_of_China;\n+ 10 members of the actual Politburo have near the age of the the rule of qi-shang, ba-xia (Liu Yunshan, Zhang Dejiang, Yu Zhengsheng, Ma Kai, Li Jianguo, Zhang Gaoli, Fan Changlong, Meng Jianzhu, Li Zhanshu, Guo Jinlong). This question as  written,  if one of them is leaving by death it is not a resignation, a suspension, or a removed action.
