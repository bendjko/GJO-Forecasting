He can't help himself from trying to look like the guy in the know. This makes Republican leaders crazy because he gives away their bottom line before he begins.  He does not understand the art of negotiation at all.  http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/09/politics/donald-trump-immigration-contradictions/index.html Trump said DACA could come first and reform could come down the road, or immediately after.\n\"I think what we are all saying is we'll do DACA and we can certainly start comprehensive immigration reform the following afternoon, OK?\" Trump said. \"We'll take an hour off and start. I do believe that. Because once we get DACA done if it's done properly with security and everything else, if it's done properly, we have taken a big chunk of comprehensive out of the negotiations.

Dems are more likely to allow the government to shut down this time and Republicans have problems in their own caucus regarding funding the wall.
