Putin Remark Adds To Speculation About His Future\nDecember 19, 2019  \"Somewhere before the request for more money for Yekaterinburg\u2019s subway, but after the question about the high cost of flying to the faraway Kamchatka Peninsula, President Vladimir Putin got a couple of politically vital questions during his marathon annual news conference on December 19. \"Is it time to change to constitution?\u201d he was asked by a reporter from the state news agency RIA-Novosti. Should the balance of power between president, parliament, and cabinet be changed? Putin responded by saying there was no need for a new constitution \u2013 not that anyone asked about such a radical change. \"This is a living document, it should reflect the level of development of society,\" he said. \"But I nevertheless think that for us...a new constitution, does not need to be passed.\" One way the constitution could potentially be changed, he said, was to \"remove the word 'consecutive'\" from the clause that says no person can serve two consecutive presidential terms. \"Your humble servant served two successive terms and then stepped down and had the constitutional right to return to the post of president\u2026. But some of our political scientists and activists do not like this and maybe this could be removed, possibly,\" he said.\n. . . \nAnd both he [Medvedev] and the Kremlin have remained coy about what plans are in store. Putin still commands relatively high popularity ratings, despite a slip over the past year or two. But his allies have floated ideas about changing the constitution, including in September when a longtime confidant hinted at it. Prior to that, it was the speaker of the lower house of parliament, the State Duma, and even the chief justice of the Constitutional Court. The issue of changing the constitution is fraught for several reasons, experts say; not least of which is that such a change would be accompanied by the perception that it benefits Putin.  More importantly, however, is that it's unclear what exactly he was proposing. Signaling To Future Leaders? Some of Putin\u2019s biggest cheerleaders said the remarks were definitive: he won\u2019t run for another term -- neither in 2024 nor in 2030, when he would be eligible under the current wording of the constitution. \"If anyone had any doubts about whether the Boss will seek another presidential term, he will not,\" Margarita Simonyan, the editor-in-chief of Russian state-funded broadcaster RT, wrote in a post to Twitter. But Will Pomeranz, a Russian constitutional law expert and deputy director at Washington\u2019s Kennan Institute, said it appears that the specific part of the constitution where the word \"consecutive\" is written can be changed with a super majority in the Duma. He said the cryptic wording Putin used in answering the question may suggest not that Putin was looking necessarily to stay in power by amending the constitution. Rather, he was signaling to future leaders that no one else would be able to replicate his four terms as president. \"The way he has raised the issue, it would appear that no else could serve more than two consecutive terms. Unless he's trying to get rid of the entire clause, which would allow for unlimited terms, but that\u2019s not what I think he\u2019s doing,\" said Pomeranz, author of a recent book on Russian law. \"The reading I have now is that it would mean no one else in the future could do what [Putin] did,\" in having four non-consecutive terms, he said. Other Potential Scenarios That would still leave room for Putin to hold power from another position after he leaves the presidency. There are several scenarios that have also come up for discussion, either by Putin allies or by Kremlin analysts. One would be what Vyacheslav Volodin, the speaker of the Duma, has hinted at: tweaking the constitution to lessen the powers of the presidency and strengthen the powers of a parliament, making for a more powerful prime minister. For the factions known as the siloviki -- a shorthand word describing members of the military, intelligence, security, and police agencies -- the problem is that this could open the door to greater scrutiny from Duma members in the future. Another would be what some observers have called the Nazarbaev scenario -- named for Nursultan Nazarbaev, who stepped down as Kazakh president this year but heads the country\u2019s Security Council and holds other positions that allow him to exert strong influence on politics in the Central Asian nation. Still another would involve what amounts to closer integration with Belarus under the Union State, which exists largely on paper but -- if beefed up -- could potentially be a vehicle for Putin to hold power over both Russia and Belarus. The problem with that is Belarus\u2019s longtime leader, Alyaksandr Lukshenka, has resisted an effort that would see him losing clout in his own country. Putin and Lukashenka were supposed to conclude a road-map agreement that would pave the way for the Union State this month. It didn\u2019t happen."], [40930, "2019-12-19T16:44:21Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2019-12-19T14:57:56Z", [0.0], ""], [81145, "2019-12-18T22:40:28Z", [0.0], ""], [81138, "2019-12-18T13:06:51Z", [0.5], ""], [691, "2019-12-16T14:20:52Z", [0.0], ""], [70711, "2019-12-16T10:20:42Z", [0.0], ""], [62808, "2019-12-16T09:48:27Z", [0.0], ""], [18679, "2019-12-16T07:55:40Z", [0.0], ""], [206, "2019-12-15T18:38:33Z", [0.0], ""], [81061, "2019-12-14T06:20:01Z", [0.0], ""], [42004, "2019-12-13T16:26:24Z", [0.01], ""], [1034, "2019-12-13T08:35:03Z", [0.0], ""], [37236, "2019-12-12T15:05:03Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2019-12-12T12:49:35Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2019-12-11T13:14:54Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2019-12-10T19:42:07Z", [0.0], ""], [3110, "2019-12-09T20:47:52Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2019-12-09T13:44:53Z", [0.0], ""], [37379, "2019-12-09T02:06:37Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2019-12-08T22:53:39Z", [0.0], ""], [67844, "2019-12-08T16:02:22Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2019-12-08T12:42:51Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2019-12-07T13:33:55Z", [0.0], ""], [41922, "2019-12-06T16:10:25Z", [0.0], ""], [14432, "2019-12-06T06:41:05Z", [0.0], ""], [80826, "2019-12-05T18:42:34Z", [0.02], ""], [1034, "2019-12-04T21:33:45Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2019-12-04T15:26:41Z", [0.0], ""], [1333, "2019-12-04T15:00:26Z", [0.0], ""], [12591, "2019-12-04T14:05:53Z", [0.01], ""], [1034, "2019-12-03T20:42:04Z", [0.0], ""], [37250, "2019-12-03T16:18:37Z", [0.0], ""], [23879, "2019-12-02T18:10:34Z", [0.0], ""], [43003, "2019-12-02T01:11:46Z", [0.0], "Less than 0.5% rounding to zero"], [691, "2019-12-01T19:20:47Z", [0.01], ""], [80742, "2019-12-01T15:49:27Z", [0.05], ""], [60033, "2019-11-30T04:34:51Z", [0.0], ""], [70948, "2019-11-29T16:10:49Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2019-11-29T13:56:07Z", [0.01], ""], [63963, "2019-11-28T16:47:38Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2019-11-28T14:20:22Z", [0.01], ""], [1034, "2019-11-26T21:41:48Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2019-11-26T18:42:41Z", [0.01], ""], [70948, "2019-11-25T14:44:05Z", [0.01], ""], [62737, "2019-11-25T13:47:39Z", [0.0], "Time."], [1333, "2019-11-24T18:53:25Z", [0.01], ""], [78969, "2019-11-24T14:36:19Z", [0.0], "Not enough time for a whole legislative procedure."], [62808, "2019-11-23T02:02:47Z", [0.0], ""], [37236, "2019-11-22T18:19:59Z", [0.0], ""], [57778, "2019-11-22T09:18:30Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2019-11-21T14:30:50Z", [0.02], ""], [25141, "2019-11-21T12:52:24Z", [0.0], ""], [80613, "2019-11-20T21:49:47Z", [0.03], ""], [80560, "2019-11-20T21:47:03Z", [0.0], ""], [79464, "2019-11-19T22:22:37Z", [0.0], ""], [80594, "2019-11-19T12:56:47Z", [0.05], ""], [691, "2019-11-18T15:40:52Z", [0.02], ""], [56294, "2019-11-18T14:58:03Z", [0.02], ""], [80559, "2019-11-18T00:39:33Z", [0.0], ""], [79783, "2019-11-17T19:53:47Z", [0.0], "Dropping to 0, as there have been no news on it and there is no time left for a constitutional reform "], [38094, "2019-11-17T19:38:38Z", [0.0], "Before 1 January 2020, will any change be made to the Russian Constitution that would allow Vladimir Putin to remain in a leadership role after his current term?

Two months later, it was the speaker of the State Duma, a Putin ally, echoing the same sentiment -- a sentiment he doubled down on again in July. Now, one of Putin's former KGB colleagues, a fellow St. Petersburg native who heads the powerful state conglomerate Rostec, is weighing in . . .  \"It must not be changed fundamentally, of course,\" Sergei Chemezov told the newspaper RBK in an interview published on September 16. \"But life goes on, life changes. In any case, it should be decided collectively, should be submitted to the discussion of the people.\"\n. . . \n. . . Chemezov's comments were a sign that the discussions in the Kremlin and in Putin's inner circle are gaining new momentum as members of Moscow's elite grapple with a question that, for them and the country, is one of the most momentous since the Soviet collapse: What to do about Putin? Tatyana Stanovaya, founder of the political consulting firm R.Politik, says that Chemezov's comments reflect some of the thinking going on behind closed doors -- and that it is unusual for someone so close to Putin to raise the issue openly. \"From my point of view it's something very new and strange,\" says Stanovaya, a longtime analyst of Kremlin activity. \"And as we know, Putin's friends usually don't interfere in internal policies, political issues, and they stay away from any political conflict or difficult situation, so it looks really very strange.\"\n. . . \nBut Russians have grown increasingly impatient, as sanctions, isolation, demographics, and corruption drag on the country's long-term economic prospects. His popularity has slipped noticeably since his reelection. Approval ratings for United Russia, the Kremlin-affiliated party that dominates politics nationwide, are worse -- so much so that some candidates try to obscure their affiliation by running as independents. There's wide agreement among political analysts that Putin in recent years has grown increasingly dependent on an increasingly smaller circle of advisers, allies, and friends. Some, like Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Chemezov, date back to his days in St. Petersburg and beyond -- the latter served alongside Putin when they were KGB officers in East Germany in the Soviet era. Some, also like Chemezov and presidential Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev, come from a KGB background, and are among the group known in Russian as the siloviki. Others, like the Rotenberg brothers, are former judo-sparring partners and St. Petersburg allies, who have parlayed their proximity to Putin into lucrative state contracts. Those groups have flourished under Putin, and built their own wealth and power bases. For that reason, experts say, it's hard to imagine a democratic transition where Putin simply steps down at the end of 2024 and hands over the reins to a democratically elected successor. Adding further urgency is the fact that lawmakers in the Duma will run for election in two years. If United Russia loses seats in September 2021, that would make it harder to push through any possible constitutional changes. \"The Kremlin is not really thinking about how they're going to prepare for these elections, whether they should reform United Russia, what to do with the...opposition,\" Stanovaya says. \"For Putin, everything is fine, he thinks United Russia is a stable party with a good level of support, and even if it faces some decrease of approval, the situation is not critical,\" she says. \"So no need for changes. For the Kremlin, for the presidential administration, it's very hard to talk about reforms when Putin feels like doesn't need it.\" For Chemezov's part, the conglomerate he heads is one of several powerful state-owned corporations that control an increasingly large segment of the economy. Rostec's companies include some of Russia's best-known brands, including arms exporter Rosoboroneksport, Russian Helicopters, truck manufacturer KamAZ, and legendary gunmaker Kalashnikov.\n. . .\nIn an article published in the state-run newspaper Rossiiskaya gazeta in October 2018, Valery Zorkin, the chairman of the Constitutional Court, floated the proposition that the constitution -- adopted in 1993 under Putin's predecessor, Boris Yeltsin -- was ambiguous and outdated. \"Of course, our constitution has shortcomings,\" Zorkin wrote. \"These include the lack of an adequate balance in the system of checks and balances; bias in favor of the executive branch of government; the lack of clarity in the distribution of powers between the president and the government.\" Three months later, in comments made directly to Putin during a Kremlin meeting, Vyacheslav Volodin, the head of the lower chamber of parliament, suggested it was time to begin discussing changing the document, possibly in order to water down the powers of the presidency and increase that of parliament. \"There are questions in society,\" said Volodin, who also served as deputy chief of staff in the presidential administration. \"This is the time when we could answer these questions, without in any way threatening the fundamental provisions\" of the constitution. Volodin returned to that question in July in an opinion article published in the official parliamentary newspaper, arguing there was a \"lack of a necessary balance between the work of the legislative and executive branches\" that must be fixed. Putin himself has downplayed the possibility of changing the constitution and the idea that he and his allies are considering options that would enable him to stay in power beyond 2024. \"At present I don't plan any constitutional reforms,\" he said after his reelection in March 2018. Asked specifically about Volodin's earlier comments or what specific constitutional changes he would propose, Chemezov qualified his remarks. \"I'm not saying that it ought to be changed. You have to ask Volodin what he had in mind,\" he said. Chemezov also did not advocate any specific changes in the constitution and seemed to suggest he does not favor scrapping term limits to let Putin stay on as president past 2024. He said that \"since under the constitution he cannot go on leading the country, he could take up some other post.\" For Putin to leave the presidency but still retain ultimate power from another post -- head of a beefed-up union with Belarus, for example -- a change in the constitution would probably be required. Stanovaya says that at this point \"no one understands how Putin is going to solve this problem, the 2024 problem.\" \"No one understands how we can change the constitution. There are a lot of projects, a lot of ideas\" being discussed in the Kremlin, she says. 'Politburo 2.0' Chemezov also voiced in the interview veiled criticism of how Moscow and federal authorities were responding to liberal opposition groups who sought to get their candidates on the ballot for the Moscow City Duma elections in September. After local election authorities blocked the candidates, the groups organized near-weekly protests in Moscow; one was among the largest political demonstrations since 2012. Riot police and National Guard troops violently cracked down on one unauthorized protest on July 27, fueling outrage among liberal groups. Putin's inner circle and its decision-making process has been dubbed by Russian political analysts as \"Politburo 2.0\" -- a reference to the most important decision-making body during the Soviet Union. Chemezov bristled at that comparison. \"Honestly, it always makes me smile. You come up with some hypotheses, some system of communication. What is this 'Politburo 2.0?' As if we get together and then discuss some sort of personnel appointments. I know many of these people, but we never have any special meetings with them,\" he said. @dsarin"], [21046, "2019-09-16T02:36:30Z", [0.04], ""], [1034, "2019-09-15T21:51:40Z", [0.0], ""], [79464, "2019-09-15T21:37:37Z", [0.01], ""], [62737, "2019-09-15T05:46:25Z", [0.02], "Time."], [79387, "2019-09-13T18:27:12Z", [0.02], ""], [79379, "2019-09-13T16:36:50Z", [0.0], ""], [79379, "2019-09-13T16:35:55Z", [1.0], "Comment deleted on Sep 13, 2019 04:36PM UTC"], [76964, "2019-09-12T21:22:50Z", [0.0], ""], [21884, "2019-09-12T21:02:53Z", [0.02], ""], [79312, "2019-09-12T13:08:28Z", [0.01], ""], [691, "2019-09-12T12:15:40Z", [0.03], ""], [42004, "2019-09-11T14:16:36Z", [0.1], ""], [42004, "2019-09-11T14:16:26Z", [0.15], ""], [691, "2019-09-10T13:17:51Z", [0.07], ""], [41389, "2019-09-10T10:36:46Z", [0.03], ""], [23879, "2019-09-09T15:35:14Z", [0.04], "Down from 5% due to passage of time."], [41707, "2019-09-08T08:07:18Z", [0.03], ""], [78343, "2019-09-07T01:53:38Z", [0.17], "He'll stay in power for as long as he wants, he can manipulate the majority of the public and the media to his liking (he's ex KGB) he knows all the tricks, right down to triggering a war to draw attention away from other tedious issues, such as economic downturn, in turn bolstering his ratings (Georgia 2008).

They are now increasingly at odds amid mostly hidden jockeying to influence a protracted and possibly unruly succession struggle. With the arrest of Mr. Muzraev, however, the infighting burst into the open.\n...Last month, however, the official, Mikhail K. Muzraev, was forced from his car at gunpoint near his home in the city now called Volgograd by a team of heavily armed men sent from Moscow by Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service, or F.S.B., the main successor agency to the K.G.B. He was flown to Moscow and jailed the same day.\n...On Thursday, in another sign of turmoil in Volgograd\u2019s justice system, a female judge on the municipal court was found dead outside her apartment building in the center of the city. She was reported to have \u201cfallen\u201d from the window of her apartment on the 15th floor.\n...Nikolai Petrov, a political scientist, said the abrupt fall from grace at the hands of the F.S.B. of such a powerful law-enforcement figure as Mr. Muzraev was a clear sign that a divide-and-rule balance between different clans of \u201csiloviki\u201d \u2014 whose loyalty to the Kremlin and wariness of each other have been the bedrock of Mr. Putin\u2019s rule \u2014 is wobbling.\n\u201cWithout a clear signal from Putin about what he will do in 2024 or who will replace him, the whole system is coming apart,,\u201d Mr. Petrov said. \u201cPutin is in control of all major moves, but we see more and more moves by this or that elite clan.\u201d\n...Mr. Putin could well attempt another ruse to stay on after 2024 but anxiety about his intentions has left rival power centers scrambling to assert their influence ahead of a possible transfer of power at the top, political analysts say.\n...Mr. Kurilla added that it was not yet clear who would win the fight over Mr. Muzraev and his record in Volgograd, but it was already clear that it involved far more than a mere provincial quarrel. \u201cSomething is going on in Moscow,\u201d he said.\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/13/world/europe/fsb-intelligence-committee-putin-russia-muzraev.html ...With public support for President Vladimir Putin wilting, the Kremlin is considering changing election rules in an effort to secure its lock on parliament ahead of potentially vital decisions that could extend his rule. Putin faces the end of what under the constitution must be his final presidential term in 2024. Though he\u2019s given no public hint of his intentions, aides and advisers are working on ways to allow him to prolong his rule, already the longest since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, according to people involved in the efforts. Maintaining the ruling United Russia party\u2019s two-thirds majority in parliament -- necessary for making constitutional changes -- could be essential to that.\n...But with less than 18 months to go before the parliamentary vote, United Russia\u2019s popularity has dropped along with Putin\u2019s after five straight years of falling consumer incomes. Amid poll ratings at a 13-year low, the party\u2019s candidates have lost several recent regional elections, despite the Kremlin\u2019s monopoly control of the system.\n...The Kremlin is now considering cutting the share of seats elected by party lists in the 450-member State Duma lower house of parliament to only 25% from half under current law, according to two people familiar with the preparations who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential matters. The rest would be elected in local districts where many pro-Kremlin candidates run as nominally independent to avoid the stigma of United Russia membership.\nThe changes would take effect for the next parliamentary elections in 2021, giving Putin full control of a new legislature three years before the end of his term, one of the people said. The Kremlin has shifted the proportions several times before to suit its electoral needs and the changes don\u2019t require constitutional amendment. The authorities have tight control over who can get on the local ballots and usually block opposition candidates.\nThe mixed voting system in 2016 enabled United Russia to secure a three-quarters majority with only 54% of the vote because pro-Kremlin candidates successfully campaigned as independents in local districts. But the party\u2019s support has since plunged to a third as popular opinion turned against the authorities amid the slump in living standards. Six Kremlin-backed gubernatorial candidates in September\u2019s elections have dropped their party affiliation to run as nominally unaffiliated after United Russia contenders lost last year.\nWith the current voting system, United Russia at best will obtain a simple majority in the Duma in 2021, said Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the nationalist Liberal Democratic Party, one of three other parties in the Duma. \u201cUnited Russia\u2019s national score can hardly exceed 20% to 30% - that\u2019s our forecast.\u201d\nKeeping a strong hold on Parliament would widen Putin\u2019s room for maneuver. It could potentially allow the 66-year-old Russian president to switch roles, keeping the reins of power as head of the ruling party and prime minister with expanded constitutional authority at the expense of the presidency, said two people close to the Kremlin and a ruling-party legislator.\nBut it\u2019s not clear whether Putin would back such a switch, since shifting power to the parliament would go against the presidential system that\u2019s widely seen to suit Russia, said Alexei Mukhin, head of the Moscow-based Center for Political Information.\n...With the Russian leader repeatedly ruling out abolishing term limits, discussion of possible scenarios for 2024 is in a deadlock, according to Sergei Markov, a Kremlin political consultant. \u201cIn any case, whatever he decides in the end, Putin will need strong support from parliament,\u201d he said.\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-12/putin-seeks-to-lock-in-parliament-control-amid-falling-ratings"], [62737, "2019-07-14T14:41:12Z", [0.04], "Time.

There is simply no urgency for the Kremlin or Putin to pursue a change when there are nearly six years before the next election is held. Putin is still relatively young, especially compared to President Trump and the current candidates for the U.S. Democratic Party, several of whom are in their early 70s.

While, he may not have fully approved of the new President's every actions, he was close enough and maintained enough political power and clout to still effectively lead Russia in the direction he deemed most appropriate.  This evidence, plus Putin's increasing age and the likely desire to \"end on a high note\" and retire safely and securely are probably enough to keep him from pressing for a constitutional change.  He still has a few year to groom a successor of his choosing to ensure his legacy does not die.  The 10% yes is attributed mostly to the random crazy acts of life that happen in this world.  If the international political climate were to shift dramatically in the next six months, and he became anxious for the future of his homeland, I could see the Russian people and Putin pressing for the change to ensure continued stability instead of risking an unknown with a new president.

Currently, the next Russian elections are set to be held in 2024 at which point Putin will have fulfilled the two consecutive term limit. However, in the past Putin has found ways around this rule. In 2008, the Constitution was changed to allow for longer terms, changing from a 4 year limit to a 6 year limit. This change allowed Putin to remain in his position an extra 4 years than he otherwise would have. He has also hand picked others to serve as president while he served elsewhere in government in order to break up his time in service and not have to extend his term limits in the past. There has already been discussions within the Russian government of amending the constitution to allow Putin to serve longer.  At this time Putin claims he is not looking to serve another term but he has made similar claims in the past and still chose to run for another term. Therefore, I think it is likely the Constitution will be amended to allow Putin another term or to extend his current term. However, it is also likely that he may find other ways to skirt the term limit. Additionally, it is likely that the Constitution might be amended to allow for this prior to 1 January 2020 but I don't think it is highly likely since there will still be four more years left of his term in which that change can be made.

Russia\u2019s great power identity is an enduring legacy of its imperial past.  Ideas and ideology will continue to influence Putin\u2019s foreign policy over the current presidential term.  Putin arguably remains the dominant political figure in Russia.  Nobody\u2019s certain Putin could pull off a transfer of power without triggering destabilizing infighting among rival Kremlin camps that currently is held in check by his rule. The political and personal risks to Putin are high https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-21/kremlin-wonders-if-putin-may-follow-kazakh-model-to-keep-power.   Putin, 66, won a fourth and presumably final term with a record 77 percent in elections last year. He\u2019s crushed political opposition and centralized power in his own hands since he was first elected in 2000, becoming so dominant that many Russians find it hard to name potential successors even as his popularity has declined https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-21/kremlin-wonders-if-putin-may-follow-kazakh-model-to-keep-power.  All said, in early 2019, Russia's trust in its President\u00a0Vladimir Putin\u00a0has fallen to its lowest level since 2006, falling more than 33 percent, according to a recent poll conducted by the Russian-state Public Opinion Research Center. Confidence in Putin\u2019s government fell 33.4 percent amid sluggish economic growth, a decline in disposable income, and a deeply unpopular rise in the retirement age.  The trust level was at 71 percent in July 2015 after Russia's annexed\u00a0Ukraine\u2019s Crimea https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/01/poll-shows-russia-trust-putin-falls-time-190122184309853.html.  When Putin came to power in the midst of economic turmoil in 1998, he promised Russians better living conditions and decent salaries, in exchange for the freedom of expression - the social contract.  For this reason, the inability to deliver might very well overshadow political culture.  Any constitutional change before 01 January 2020 would send this public perception deeper into the negative.  For now- it is likely Putin will appear to depart as scheduled while considering ways to influence the Kremlin into the future to bolster his legacy.

After through looking through various sources, there is no way to tell yet what he will do. The reports present that he has two cabinet members that could be two possible successors. However, the reality of this announcement is that there are hidden motives that could be present underneath. For example, maybe Vladimir Putin and his team are just putting out feelers for how the public will react to the suggested future leaders. Depending on how the public reacts and how Putin decides to address it will greatly change the way this prediction plays out. Additionally, his character as a leader can be an indication of what we should expect in the next year. Sure, he is impulsive and unreliable, but his grasp on his cabinet and the people who surround him is an entirely meticulous and well thought-through product of his eagerness to maintain control. Therefore, looking ahead at the election past 2024, some ideas and plans may be in the works that we don't know about.

If memory serves, forecasts are only really accurate a year and a half out, so with resolution in 2020 this is not likely to even be predictable from here. That said, let's go through my thinking on this 6%. In my view Putin is likely to retire at some point. It seems unlikely that he would die in office given that he heads an oligarchy rather than a full blown dictatorship. That is to say, he can name a successor and leave power as long as his cliche remains in power. This may even be appealing, as he could retire as a great Russian leader  in the eyes of the public (and, potentially, history) to become an elder statesmen and spend some of that cash he's been piling up. In one scenario he names a successor and leaves office, but still remains a powerful influencer in the government a la Deng Xiaoping. In another he finds that he cannot leave power safely, as it would spark a succession crisis or be dangerous to him personally. And in a final scenario he wants to hold on to power into his 70's and does so. In all of these cases Putin remains a powerful force in Russian politics far into the future, so is not \"going anywhere\", however he may cease to be president. The latter two, while still somewhat likely in the long run, I don't think are particularly likely in the time span of this question. If you want to amend the constitution to allow Putin to serve longer you'd probably want to have his retirement looming in the near future. Politically, to accomplish that you might wish to play on people's patriotism by saying how strong Putin has made Russia and how we need to keep him into the future.

No question there, especially when power has become too concentrated in one individual + small leadership group, and such a cadre thinks that the well-being and future success of the country depends on them. In other words, they believe that there is nobody else that can do the job, things will fall apart without them, and of course they and their cadre and family + close associates will lose benefits with leaving power. Therefore, the baseline for Putin, taking into account the experience of other countries, is actually one of a proclivity to changing the Constitution. Thus, I continue to forecast that a change will be made to the Constitution to allow Putin to remain in a leadership role after his current term, but don't think this will take place by the due date of the question."], [37379, "2019-01-06T10:49:25Z", [0.1], "Putin could run a new Medevev type deal to keep control via a figurehead."], [34353, "2019-01-04T15:43:39Z", [0.05], ""], [691, "2019-01-04T13:30:50Z", [0.1], ""], [63848, "2019-01-04T05:01:51Z", [0.7], ""], [30610, "2019-01-03T14:25:33Z", [0.02], ""], [63963, "2019-01-02T23:30:19Z", [0.05], ""], [63893, "2019-01-02T04:28:51Z", [0.1], ""], [13377, "2018-12-31T16:56:46Z", [0.08], ""], [691, "2018-12-31T12:55:15Z", [0.1], ""], [63401, "2018-12-30T23:15:42Z", [0.03], "Upon further consideration of information available in my earlier forecast today, I am making an adjustment to my forecast.

In fact, various expert viewpoints are being expressed, including Volodin\u2019s stance, but no position on this has been outlined and no works in this context are being conducted,\" [2] (2)  Valery Zorkin, the chairman of the Constitutional Court, stated earlier this year:  \"Of course, our Constitution has its drawbacks.

I'm going to put this at 8% (approximately 1 in 12) for the following reasons: FOR: -Taking after @pietrokc, with the assumption that Putin is capable of changing the Constitution, there is little incentive for President Putin to announce such a decision so early. The Russian regime is an oligarchy that requires a strong central figure to balance and hedge against the competing interests of a very powerful and wealthy selectorate. Announcing a decision early would inevitably create greater instability for Russia, all else equal, given that he would likely face organized dissent -- whether from the oligarchy or the Russia citizenry themselves. If anything, Putin would more likely announce a decision closer to the end of his term in 2024 rather than in the next year. Taking the outside view, maintaining political survival is best achieved by giving an opposition little time to offer a challenge (an analogous example is \"snap elections\" in dictatorships, e.g. with Mubarak's Egypt). -From what I understand, especially from the writings of Micheal McFaul (former Russian Ambassador), President Putin has some semblance of respect for the Constitutional term limits of Russia -- and at least some support for a minimal definition of democracy. Arguably, that's why he stepped down in 2008 to allow Dmitry Medvedev to serve. There is a modest probability that this will occur again, while President Putin maintains power in the shadows as Prime Minister. AGAINST: -President Putin encountered greater insecurity than normal during his 2012 presidential elections, facing substantial protests. He ultimatley blamed the United States for inciting these protests. If anything, this increases the likelihood that he would unilaterally extend his leadership in some form. -There is little doubt that President Putin seeks a consolidated Russia in the ashes of the Soviet Union. Given recent progressions of NATO (Georgia, Ukraine, Bosnia), Putin may see it as necessary to remain in the position of President, given that it's the primary governmental organ that engages foreign policy. At the same time, the current US administration appears conducive to Putin's interests in disassembling the international order, and he may see it as important to remain engaged on this issue.

In the focus groups, the researchers played a game with their subjects, asking them to imagine Russia\u2019s path as a muddy, potholed road. The road goes past a meadow that no one has ever tried crossing; it might be a swamp but there\u2019s also a chance that it could be a useful shortcut. A full 70 percent of focus-group participants said they\u2019d try crossing the meadow.  At the same time, Russians, who welcomed strongman Putin after a short fling with pluralism and democracy in the 1990s, no longer hunger for a strong hand. \u201cThe model based on strong leadership gradually turned from a remote dream into a daily routine,\u201d the researchers wrote, \u201cso its original halo of attractiveness began weakening.\u201d Now, according to them, only 7 percent of focus group participants want a strong leader, while 80 percent have shifted to demanding justice rather than order.\n...\nDespite years of intensive propaganda, the idea of Russia as a great power has only taken hold to a limited extent. In the focus groups, only 20 percent of the respondents agreed that Russia is a great power; 49 percent believe it\u2019s somewhere between a great nation and a backward one. To these people, military might and a proud history don\u2019t mean much without a prosperous, modern, socially oriented economy.  Putin\u2019s post-Crimea propaganda offensive initially stunned Russians into agreement. But then, Dmitriev, Belanovsky and Nikolskaya found, discontent with Putin's domestic policies, which had been on the rise in 2013, gradually came back. This is a dismal situation for Putin, but only potentially. Dmitriev and collaborators point out that in the absence of credible opposition leaders, protest activity is fragmented \u2014 for example, rallies against festering garbage dumps in the Moscow region earlier this year didn\u2019t lead to bigger nationwide protests. \u201cActions become local and situational, often competing among themselves, which prevents protest initiatives from achieving mass success,\u201d the researchers wrote. They also pointed to a low public interest in bringing down the regime. \u201cAggressive speech toward authority wasn\u2019t heard in any of the groups,\u201d the report says. Dmitriev and Belanovsky are moderates, so-called \u201csystem liberals\u201d who believe in reforming Russia from above. To them, the political status quo is not an obstacle to positive economic change. The resumption of popular discontent after several years of post-Crimea euphoria troubles them because it reminds them of Trumpism or the quest for simple solutions offered by European anti-immigrant parties. So the absence of charismatic populist leaders who could direct the muttering masses is something of a relief to them. On the other hand, that lack of leaders is a direct result of Putin\u2019s successful campaign of political suppression, which, as recent history shows, cannot be effective forever in Russia. If Dmitriev and Belanovsky are right and Russians have given up on their leaders and those leaders\u2019 ideological constructs, that\u2019s a lot like the situation that preceded the implosion of the Soviet repressive state in the late 1980s. Leaders with the courage and the clout to challenge the totalitarian machine emerged eventually \u2014 and the enforcers found themselves either powerless or reluctant to move against them. @Anneinak"], [691, "2018-10-16T12:30:04Z", [0.34], ""], [34353, "2018-10-16T11:44:00Z", [0.2], ""], [28414, "2018-10-16T08:34:55Z", [0.0], "Putin Is the Biggest Loser of Orthodox Schism\nAs Ukraine\u2019s church moves toward independence, the Russian president could lose his role of defender of the faith.\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-10-13/putin-is-loser-as-ukraine-s-orthodox-church-seeks-independence\n...\nt\u2019s doubtful that Putin, who has co-opted the power of the church to the service of his neo-imperialist ideology, wants to play Henry VIII, the Tudor monarch who at first was a devout Catholic but then defied Rome\u2019s spiritual authority. The Russian Church\u2019s international reach has been important to the Russian ruler. Putin has twice visited Mount Athos, the monastic enclave in Greece that is Orthodox Christianity\u2019s holiest place; it\u2019s been fashionable among regime loyalists to assert their Orthodox faith by making a pilgrimage there. Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Prosecutor General Yuri Chaika have done so, along with more than 10,000 other Russians. Athos, though, falls under the jurisdiction of the Constantinople Patriarchate, and it may be lost to Russians after a formal schism, an enormous symbolic defeat for a president intent to project a devout image. On the other hand, it\u2019s as difficult for Putin as it is for Moscow Patriarch Kirill to accept an independent Ukrainian church blessed by Constantinople. It would go against his oft-repeated assertion that Russians and Ukrainians are one people. And admitting that not Moscow but Istanbul, with only a few hundred Orthodox believers, is the true seat of power of global Orthodoxy would be almost unbearable. Compared to these spiritual wounds, the potential loss of many of the Russian church\u2019s 12,328 parishes in Ukraine, and the income from them, is arguably less catastrophic.\n...\nRussia\u2019s best hope is to sow discord and keep priests loyal to Moscow from defecting to the future Ukrainian church.

No matter how hard Russia tries to slow down Ukrainian autocephaly, the damage cannot be fully contained.

I originally forecast 25% in late April 2018 and, although there was a bit of a red herring in the form of Kadyrov's proposal to extend term limits to 3 [1], it does not seem to be going anywhere. Putin seems to have disavowed it, and in any case I see at least two problems with it: (i) Putin is 65 today. Suppose the 3rd term is approved and he serves it. Then by early 2030, at the time of new elections, he'd be 77. I feel like in that scenario it would be harder for him to do anything: secure a 4th term, make himself Prime Minister, what have you. After approval of 3 terms, approval of a 4th term would be a much harder sell I think; so Putin might then actually be trying to simply not be put in jail by his opponents.\n(ii) Speaking abstractly, Putin's opponents can do attacks on him, hoping to bring him down. Usually attacks come with a cost, like forming alliances you don't like, using resources, or at the very least revealing that you are an opponent (which might have been hidden until then). The more uncertain it is if Putin even needs to be attacked --- if he might simply leave the post of President --- the less attractive it is to attack. So it is to Putin's advantage to keep the suspense up as long as he can. I feel like whatever he wants to do to stay in power, he can definitely accomplish in the four years between this Q ending, and his term being up. For these reasons, I think Kadyrov's proposal should in hindsight not have raised the odds from 25% in late April. So if I draw a simple line from 25% in early May 2018 to 1% in early December 2019, that puts early September at 16%.

He's very vocal in saying he will abide by the law and won't change it, yet he's careful to follow up with a lot of focus on how popular he is, how much the Muscovites love him, how the Navalny thing wasn't a thing because the public had access to the internet and could have backed him they wanted but he's really just a rebel and a clown, and that was really \"getting ahead of the game\" and nothing more at the moment than \"speculation.\"  In other words, he won't come at it directly even when prompted but he's careful to leave a HUGE space to suggest it's possible but not up to him.  Plus his interpretation of what is clearly and \"strictly\" legal in the same conversation about the Crimean vote for Russia is laughable but clearly also something he can apply here with less concern.  If the Chechens propose the bill and the other groups in the Duma think it's a great idea (they generally support Putin), then Putin wasn't tampering with the constitution; it was being changed in a completely \"democratic\" process.  And it does solve the problem of security issues for Putin and competition between oligarchs in the near future.  And it allows Putin to stay in the center of things, which I think he would choose.  \nhttps://www.memri.org/reports/putin-russias-interference-europe-%E2%80%93-putin-we-keep-40-our-gold-and-currency-reserves-euro-why\nhttps://www.rt.com/politics/426475-chechen-putin-third-term/ I think it's unlikely that Putin would push something like this so early, but it really REALLY benefits him to have it take care of so quickly, while he's still got such a huge approval rating and can very easily weather the storm.  Furthermore, he can look good (strong, capable, willing to sacrifice his aging body for the benefit of the state) and still appear as someone who upholds the law (go along with the Duma if the demand is high enough).  The country approval ratings are still high (though a notable spike in concern about corruption, as was in 2012) and probably wouldn't drop low enough to be seriously damaging even if there were protests over this.\nhttps://www.levada.ru/en/2018/05/08/societal-problems/\nhttps://www.levada.ru/en/2018/04/17/memorable-events-2/\nhttps://www.levada.ru/en/2018/05/08/protests-2/\nhttps://news.ru/politika/gubernatorov-poschitali/ From one of the most popular newspapers on the issue (one of the ONLY articles on this issue in this publication, in fact)\n...\"Changing the Constitution of the Russian Federation is more than likely, but not in terms of extending the number of presidential terms, as Putin has said many times. Putin is a legalist: he believes that if something is spelled out in the Constitution, then this is normal and legal. And since he said that he is not going to a new presidential term and is not going to change the Constitution in this respect, then I think this is for him a matter of principle.\n   \"Another thing is that we see how the leaders of the states in the post-Soviet space act. They do not necessarily act according to the Central Asian model, which repeals the time limit and establishes a lifetime presidency. No, there can be a transformation of the system - as, for example, it happened in Turkey. That is, the power is preserved in the same hands, but at the same time the system of the presidential republic is changing to a parliamentary one or something else. In this sense, it seems to me that we are already having discussions, some projects are being prepared.\n   \"Kadyrov's statement would be perceived as a PR of Kadyrov himself and a demonstration of his loyalty. But one way or another, soon enough the Kremlin will have to send a signal to the elites, so that they do not think who will be the next leader - so as not to doubt that after 2024 the power will be in the same hands. But in what configuration this happens, in what formats will be vested - the question. It seems to me that the search for an answer to this question is under way, but there is as yet no final solution. However, it must be found, because otherwise Putin turns into a \"departing nature\". And this, of course, both him and the Kremlin should be avoided.\"\n   \"But what format to create instead of the current one, to ensure the preservation of power in the same hands, has not yet been determined. It seems to me that we will see the transfer of power, not from President Putin to another president, but from Putin to President Putin in some other capacity. And this way will allow to remove all reproaches in attempts to achieve a lifetime presidency. Strictly speaking, there is no life-long presidency in China either: the restrictions that previously worked were simply lifted.\n   \"So, de facto lifelong leadership can take place, and de jure life presidency may not be. Putin is too high-minded to behave like a Central Asian dictator. It seems to me that he will make everything more elegant. But the option to transfer power to anyone else, to move away from power, in my opinion, is excluded for Putin for many reasons. Yeltsin's version of 1999 does not exist today, and now there are no institutions that could provide stability in the event of Putin's disappearance.\n   \"Hence, the system should create such institutions, or invent new ones, or strengthen those that are extremely weakened today - for such a transformation to take place. I think this transformation will be one of the most important in the content of Putin's current presidential term.\n   \"Another thing is that it is not yet clear on what background all this will happen. Will the foreign policy background be relatively favorable? Then you can expect to reduce confrontation with the West, to carry out some limited liberal economic reforms. This can be one form of transformation of the political regime. If, on the contrary, we intensify confrontation with the West, then there will be another format.\n   \"Arguing about whether there is an alternative to Putin as a leader, then I must say that the alternative does not imply a system. That is, there are really no alternatives, but not because the earth has become impoverished with talents. But because if someone appears at distant approaches, then very quickly somewhere disappears. This provides the system built in this way, but as a result it becomes a hostage to the aging leader.\n   \"It is clear that this is a dangerous state - including from the point of view of the closest circle of the leader. This condition can not last long. Therefore, it seems to me that the building of institutions in order for the system to live with the departure of the leader is absolutely inevitable. I think in the near future we will see it, \"said Nikolay Petrov\nhttp://polit.ru/article/2018/06/05/putinconst/ The second most popular news site also had only one fairly bland article (and the comments leaned negative, followed by cynical and then dismissive)\nhttps://news.mail.ru/politics/33508497/ We'll see what happens with the proposed bill and how popular it turns out to be.  If they kill it now but have discussion of the benefits and drawbacks, it gives time for the arguments to circulate and gain traction, and it can always be introduced as long as someone can argues that it's not clearly illegal and not absolutely rejected by Putin's office.  But anything that makes it look like Putin isn't the strategist behind this and is only giving in to people begging him to stay seems pretty likely to me in the end.  The repressive response about this publicly suggests that there's less than a 50% chance of it passing at the moment.

Every change comes with controversy - see the protests of 2011. But Putin put a great deal of effort into adhering to the letter of the law in 2008, although Medvedev passed reforms swiftly, no doubt in case his temporary demotion needed to be reversed. VVP isn't going to take up bee-keeping and writing poetry after 2024 - there is too much at stake to hand the reins over to someone else entirely - but I can't see another castling move to PM (too controversial) and I can't understand why he'd change the constitution himself; a desire for an appearance of legitimacy prevented him doing that the first time.  A Leader of a (reformed) State/Security Council role (as an example), with substantial powers to over-rule deadlock but not much in terms of day to day running of government, but with a President still in place (probably with particularly reduced powers over say, the MFA, defence and intel) would make some sense. These changes wouldn't want to take effect until the end of the current term so would be needlessly controversial to pass now. I also don't see any viable reports or get any sense that there is a clear successor to Putin yet - Andrei Kolesnikov at Carnegie Moscow https://carnegie.ru/commentary/75859 points to the parliamentaries in 2021 as the time this might start to take shape, and I think that analysis rings true. So the big thing here is the time bounding. Do I think it will happen? On balance, yes, although legitimate succession is also a possibility. Do I see any logical reason it would happen before 2020? Not at the moment.

While (ii), (iii), (iv) strongly suggest a positive resolution to this question, I believe (i) will dominate, due to the timeframe. 1. EXTENDING / REMOVING TERM LIMITS\nThe earlier Putin does this, opening up the possibility of making himself \"president for life\", the longer his adversaries --- both domestic and foreign --- have to organize themselves against it. So why do this in 2018-2019, thereby giving opponents 3-4 years to organize, and the chance to install someone ELSE as president for life? Xi Jinping removed term limits for himself recently, but he did it practically on the eve of the day his current term would expire. I looked into what Venezuela's Maduro did but it doesn't seem directly comparable --- he already had no term limits, and what his 2017 reforms did was disenfranchise his opposition. In 1997 Brazil, the sitting president gave himself one extra term, but only about a year before the next elections. Taking the inside view for a bit, even as late as 6 months before the 2018 elections, Putin pretended to not know whether he was going to run. On the surface it seems difficult to change the appropriate section of the Russian Constitution --- you need a 2/3 majority in lower House and 3/4 in upper House [4, Article 108.2], as well as ratification by 2/3 of the 85 \"federal subjects\" (their provinces) [5, Article 136]. But Putin didn't seem to have any trouble with this the first time around. Moreover his party holds an overwhelming 75+% of the lower house, and the next elections aren't until Sep 2021. Seeing as how Putin can \"solve\" term limits anytime he wants and doing it later is more advantageous, I give low odds that he does it before 2020: 15%. 2.  CHANGING THE GOVT STRUCTURE\nAnother way Putin could hold on to power is to add/remove/rename posts. Maybe he consolidates President and PM into Leader of the Federation, a fresh post which he never held and hence is eligible for. Maybe he creates a Head of Govt / Steward of Russia position on top of both President and PM. Same as before. Etc. This seems to me like a more troublesome version of (1), so I don't see why he'd choose it instead of (1). The base rates are also against it, since the term extension was the only significant amendment since 1993 [3]. So let's give this option 5%. Assuming Putin does want to hold on to power beyond 2024, how is he gonna do it? My best guess is: 3. PRESIDENT - PM SWITCHAROO\nLast time Putin was kept from power by the Constitution, his solution was simple: he installed an old friend (Medvedev) as President, became PM, then ran again the very next time he could. In the meantime he got Medvedev to extend presidential terms, so it didn't look so bad for him to do it himself. At first I thought this strategy was shaky because Putin will be 71 in Oct 2023, and almost 76 when he took power again. This kind of wait was fine when he was 56, maybe not so much now. But as it turns out, if the President resigns, new elections are called --- there is no vice president [7, Article 92.2]. That means he can put someone up as President (maybe Medvedev again?), then have them resign quickly, for health reasons or whatever. Then he's back on the saddle. In the meantime he can be PM again. Or maybe he can run things well enough from PM that he doesn't even need this trick. 4. THE CROWD\nSo I get 20% chance, whereas currently the crowd sits at 63%. However there aren't that many forecasters on this Q yet, and there's lots of anti-Putin propaganda on western TV. So I will only mildly adjust towards crowd: 25%.

No, he would not amend it to remain in office beyond 2008, despite sycophantic urgings for him to scrap the limit of two consecutive presidential terms that meant he had to step aside. It seems, however, that Mr Putin and his henchmen may have hit upon a way of honouring his promises, while making it possible for him to reclaim his old job almost immediately. In May, Mr Putin installed Dmitry Medvedev as his successor, and became prime minister himself; now Mr Medvedev is apparently going to change the constitution for him. In his first\u2014and conceivably last\u2014presidential state-of-the-nation address Mr Medvedev said that he wanted to extend the presidential term from four years to six. The Kremlin then submitted the relevant legislation to parliament and three days later, on Friday November 14th, the Duma, the lower house, passed the bill on its first reading. This would not amount to a reform of the constitution, Mr Medvedev insisted; rather it was merely a clarification. Before the change becomes law, it must also be approved by the upper house and by two-thirds of Russia's regional legislatures. But since these bodies, like the Duma, are controlled by the Kremlin, their acquiescence will be automatic. Russia's post-Soviet constitution has not been changed since it came into force in 1993. The Kremlin's ostensible argument for doing so now is that, to implement reform in a country as big and complex as Russia, a president needs a longer term. The new six-year rule would not apply to Mr Medvedev's current term; but the overall limit for his successors would in effect become 12 years. (The term for parliamentarians is also to be extended, from four years to five). The question is, why the rush? Mr Medvedev's hasty manoeuvre is reminiscent of the changes made to Russia's governance arrangements in 2004, after the terrorist outrage at a school in Beslan, North Ossetia. Then, Mr Putin scrapped gubernatorial elections in Russia's regions. The explanation favoured by many in Moscow now is the same as the real reason in 2004: to cement Mr Putin's grip on power.\" some change is necessary\nbased on frequency close to 0\nbased on how autocratic rule decays historically\nSee Hiero of Syracuse or Plato\n outside in\nGeography:\nTurkey and Iran and PRC\nare lifetime autocratic states\nPRC is big ally and geographic challenge One Belt.....\nTurkey and PRC can Vlad be far behind? economics: unless Gazprom is underneath US sanctions\ndepletion should hit current production\nSee Russia push for no sanctions.\nSocial discontent can and will increase\nSo I rate Russia in UKR and Putin in office are co:dependent variables\nPutin and crony's need to secure power is permanent\nas long as he lives\nPutin is 65 that gives him 9 years\nJust like his comrades hope\nhttps://www.rbth.com/politics_and_society/2017/03/24/live-longer-putin-calls-for-improving-life-expectancy_726283"], [55547, "2018-04-25T18:50:36Z", [0.75], ""], [30389, "2018-04-25T13:51:49Z", [0.3], ""], [172, "2018-04-25T12:01:47Z", [0.02], ""], [40054, "2018-04-25T07:04:48Z", [0.9], ""], [41922, "2018-04-24T23:47:05Z", [0.2], ""], [42162, "2018-04-24T17:06:56Z", [0.03], ""], [22833, "2018-04-24T16:59:12Z", [1.0], ""], [47586, "2018-04-24T06:43:45Z", [1.0], "Mr. Putin has stayed in power by making very powerful enemies and if he ever loses power he is likely to be on the receiving end of all people he has mistreated and troubled during his tenure.
