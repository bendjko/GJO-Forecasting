The Republic of Sudan's power structure is realistically fractured and tribal, but leadership, likely because of strong outside pressure, is attempting to create a two party/parliamentary hybrid government.  The exiled opposition leader has returned to Sudan and the current president's term ends in 2020.  The current president has stated he plans to step down in 2020.  Armed and murderous groups pop up in Sudan more often than the world can track.  Systematically killing 1,000 people can be completed by a small armed militia in a few days or less.  I predict an armed Sudanese group will systematically kill 1,000 or more people in a campaign before March 31, 2018.  I believe Sudan should realistically be aiming to be a country with a strong dictator that creates stability.
