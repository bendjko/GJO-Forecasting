McConnell did deploy the so-called \"nuclear option\" allowing a simple majority vote for judicial nominees, ahead of a vote on then-Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch. That followed a similar move in 2013 when Senate Democrats first used the nuclear option to make it easier to confirm then-President Barack Obama's executive and judicial appointments, except those to the Supreme Court.\" So it appears so far, anyway, that the Republicans don't have the votes to change the rules and do away with the filibuster altogether, and in the one instance where they did change the rules to end it, they had an indirect precedent set by the Democrats.

Health care and tax reform are being pursued through reconciliation, which only requires 51 votes. And given health care's epic failure, even reaching 51 will be difficult for a GOP trying to reconcile the future of the party. So removing the filibuster doesn't help the GOP to achieve its major legislative agenda at this point. Could it allow them to pass more substantive legislation that isn't constrained by reconciliation rules? Yes, it could, but it would also increase the scope of any piece of major legislation, bogging down the process while the GOP reconciles its position.  If the GOP was serious about passing legislation, it would reconsider its ban on earmarks before eliminating the filibuster. Right now, House and Senate members have little incentive to compromise and vote for issues that don't directly benefit their constituents or align directly with their beliefs.

If budget reconciliation rules are violated and the Parliamentarian is overruled, then non-budget items such as anti-abortion language could be retained in the healthcare bill.

As the Breitbart piece goes on to explain, the RTLers want the Senate to overrule the parliamentarian on this point \u2014which it can, but at the risk of opening the floodgates to other non-germane amendments, like the changes in Obamacare regulations so many conservatives want. Eventually, pushing aside the special Senate rules for consideration of the budget could amount to a backdoor abolition of the legislative filibuster, as senators seek to push every controversial piece of legislation imaginable into budget bills that cannot be filibustered. That is a precedent Mitch McConnell would be reluctant to set. http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/gop-senators-parliamentarian-says-anti-abortion-language-in-healthcare-bill-violates-senate-rules/article/2626669#\nAn effort to tie abortion restrictions to tax credits in a healthcare bill doesn't meet Senate rules according to the chamber's parlimentarian, two senators said on Wednesday. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, told reporters Wednesday she believes the tax credits didn't meet the rules for reconciliation, which is the process by which Republicans are using to try to pass a healthcare bill with a simple majority to avoid a Democratic filibuster. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C. said the same. \"I believe that did not pass through the parliamentarian's review so I don't expect that,\" Collins told reporters. Tillis indicated that Republicans were looking at other ways to include anti-abortion language in the bill.\n\"It would not be in the direct sense it was proposed in the House, but I think there are ways to address most of the concerns of members,\" he said. If the senators are right about the judgment by the senate parliamentarian (which was not yet confirmed by leadership), it would complicate efforts by Republicans to craft a healthcare compromise that satisfies all of the party's ideological factions. The House-passed bill created a new set of tax credits for individuals to purchase insurance that included Hyde Amendment language, a spending rider that prohibits federal funding from going towards abortions. If that is no longer allowed, it means that in order to include anti-abortion language that will be crucial to securing the votes of conservatives, Senate drafters will have to come up with a new way to introduce their tax credits, most likely by running them through an existing program that already includes Hyde language, or by tweaking the tax credits in Obamacare itself.

I know, McConnell has said he won't go nuclear on the legislative filibuster.

Healthcare isn't it: if anything ever comes out of the House, it will be some unlovable mutant that will likely be suffocated in conference so that no Senator has to vote on it publicly. The budget might be it, but that has to start in the House. Even then, McConnell has the option of doing some reconciliation magic to get it through on 51 votes. Wait on this one to see where we are in September. Tax reform might be it, but that, too, has to start in the House and Paul Ryan seems to be having trouble passing the salt, as they say, let alone something as complex as a tax reform package. Were I McConnell, I'd wait for the 2018 mid-terms. The Ds have 25 seats up of which 13 are in play to some degree. The Rs have 9 seats up of which 2 are in play.

Why risk unforeseeable backlash for changing the rules if you can get what you want under the current rules by just holding tight for 18 months?

With the administration unable to achieve much in the first 100 days, and the desire to have some substantial achievement prior to the completion of his first year in office and the subsequent State of the Union, Trump and the R's will want to push forward some major piece of legislation (whether health care or tax reform remains to be seen).  With the Senate R's only holding 52 seats, and assuming no loss of seats due to unforeseen circumstances, they will need to convince Senate D's to support their legislation. If this fails, which is fairly likely if health care remains in its current version and if tax reform disproportionately benefits the wealthy, Senate D's will attempt to block the legislation via filibuster. At that time, Senate Republican leadership will have to decide whether to go nuclear, or let the legislation, and the chance to show substantial achievement and ability to govern, be defeated. As the 1-year mark gets progressively closer, the WH will put increasing pressure on McConnell to go nuclear to pass major legislation, and he will likely be more inclined, as the legislative filibuster is already viewed as likely to be eliminated within the next few years.
