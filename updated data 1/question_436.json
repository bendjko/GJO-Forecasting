The waterways are also a vital link between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. The article states that nearly 55 percent of India's trade passes through the crucial route while Japan and South Korea\u2019s energy and commerce are also heavily dependent on sea routes.\nWhile China already commands control on East and South China Seas \u2014 despite unsettled disputes in the region \u2014 of late it is striking a more and more assertive posture in the IOR.\nBesides this, past experience in South China Sea shows that China's policy of patient, stealthy but steady consolidation of power in disputed regions have paid up for Beijing in the past. Today, China has built \"seven man-made islets in the hotly contested Spratlys, with the three boasting military-grade airfields.

The newspaper report further claims it to be a \u201cpart of a steady pattern of Chinese militarisation,\u201d irrespective of the stage at which its diplomatic relations were with its neighbours in dispute.\nTherefore, a similar authoritarian attitude in the Indian Ocean should ring a bell for New Delhi, irrespective of the current shape of bilateral ties.\" Comments: A potential PLAN breakout into the southwest Pacific?

During periods of tension, official statements and state media seek to portray china as reactive. They use an opportunistically time progression of incremental but intensifying steps to attempt to increase effective control over disputed areas and avoid escalation to military conflicts. China uses economic incentive and punitive trade policies to deter opposition to China\u2019s actions in the region.\u201d  Air Operations (page 51): \u201cPLA\u2019s planned development of a 5th generation fighter force will bolster its air-to-air capability. This will include J-20 and FC-31 fighter aircraft with key features including modern avionics and sensors that offer more timely awareness for operations in network-centric combat environments: radars with advance tracking and targeting capabilities.\u201d \nHowever, these aircraft are not expected to enter service until 2018, at the earliest. \n\u201cThe airfields, berthing areas and resupply facilities at Spratly outposts will allow China to maintain a more flexible and persistent coast guard and military presence in the area. This would improve China\u2019s ability to detect and challenge activities by rival claimants or third parties, widen the range of capabilities available to China, and reduce the time required to deploy them.\u201d  \u201cChinese press discussed a \u201cnew normal\u201d of persistent air patrols over the South China Sea by bomber and reconnaissance aircraft and also reemphasised China\u2019s intent to conduct patrols in support of its East China Sea ADIZ\u201d. There was no mention of an ADIZ over the South China Sea so its possible that China would rather intercept foreign flights on their own terms, rather than officially declare an ADIZ if they cannot knowingly enforce it at this time.  The report suggests, like previous comments from myself and other forecasters, that China is using alternative methods to an ADIZ to assert its sovereignty, such as the CCG and fishing ships. \n\u201cEnlargement and modernisation of China\u2019s Coast Guard (CCG) has improved china\u2019s ability to enforce its maritime claims. It appears China is building a state-owned fishing fleet for its maritime militia force in the South China Sea\u201d \nAlso mentioned was the legality of China\u2019s sovereign claims:\n\u201cThe tribunal ruled that China\u2019s \u201cnine-dash line\u201d cannot represent a lawful maritime claim to the extent that any of the claims it reflects would exceed the limits of China\u2019s maritime entitlements under the convention\u201d. Therefore the legality of an ADIZ over the South China Sea is questionable.

The prediction came in a 97-page annual report to Congress that saw advances throughout the Chinese military in 2016, funded by robust defense spending that the Pentagon estimated exceeded $180 billion. That is higher than China's official defense budget figure of 954.35 billion yuan ($140.4 billion). Chinese leaders, the U.S. report said, appeared committed to defense spending hikes for the \"foreseeable future,\" even as economic growth slows. The report repeatedly cited China's construction of its first overseas naval base in Djibouti, which is already home to a key U.S. military base and is strategically located at the southern entrance to the Red Sea on the route to the Suez Canal. \"China most likely will seek to establish additional military bases in countries with which it has a longstanding friendly relationship and similar strategic interests, such as Pakistan,\" the report said. Djibouti's position on the northwestern edge of the Indian Ocean has fueled worries in India that it would become another of China's 'string of pearls' of military alliances and assets ringing India, including Bangladesh, Myanmar and Sri Lanka. The report did not address India's potential reaction to a Chinese base in Pakistan. But Pakistan, the U.S. report noted, was already the primary market in the Asian-Pacific region for Chinese arms exports. That region accounted for $9 billion of the more than $20 billion in Chinese arms exports from 2011 to 2015 (para. 1-8). Stewart, P. (2017).

The waterway has become a flash-point in a broader tussle for regional influence between China and the U.S. in Asia. Speaking after the meeting, Philippines President and current Asean chairman Rodrigo Duterte said China\u2019s recent actions in the South China Sea were not discussed at the leaders\u2019 meeting on Saturday, describing any talks on the issue as \u201cuseless.\u201d \u201cThe biggest victor in diplomacy in this summit is China,\u201d Lauro Baja, former Philippine foreign affairs undersecretary, said on Saturday. \u201cAsean seems to feel and act under the shadows of China.\u201d \u201cChina is engaging Asean in a very successful diplomatic position,\u201d Baja said. \u201cAsean considers what China feels, what China thinks and how China will act in its decisions.\u201d Before the summit, Duterte told reporters that arguments between the Philippines and China over disputed maritime territory were not an issue for Asean.

The Association of South East Asian Nations had not received any guarantees from China in discussions to create a framework for the code within this year, but ASEAN was hopeful a set of rules could be agreed to ward off disputes and militarization, Le Luong Minh told Reuters. \"For ASEAN, such a framework must have substantial elements, and such a code of conduct must be legally binding,\" he said in an interview. Signing China up to a code that it must abide by, and can be enforced, has long been a goal for ASEAN's claimant members: Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei and Malaysia. China claims sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea. China's recent decision to work with ASEAN to draw up a framework for a code, 15 years after they agreed to one, has been met with a mix of optimism and scepticism, coming at a time when Beijing races ahead with development of its seven artificial islands in the Spratlys. It has put radar, runways, hangars and missiles on some of those features, causing alarm in the region and concern about its long-term intentions. The framework, which all sides hope to finish this year, seeks to advance a 2002 Declaration of Conduct (DOC) of Parties in the South China Sea, which commits to following international law, ensuring freedom of navigation and not putting people on uninhabited islands and features. MILITARIZATION ACTIVITIES \"It's important ... because of the complex developments in the South China Sea, especially the reclamation and militarization activities and all those unilateral actions,\" Minh said of the code. \"In that context, the need for an instrument which is legally binding, which is capable of not only preventing but also managing such incidents, is very important.\" Making demands of China is something ASEAN states have long been reluctant to do, wary of their economic dependence on their giant neighbor (para. 1-11).

Six hours after the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit officially ended in Manila, no customary joint statement had been issued and it was unclear whether there was agreement over including references to China's militarization and island-building in the hotly disputed waterway. ASEAN references to the South China Sea issue typically do not name China. Beijing is extremely sensitive to anything it perceives as a veiled reference to its expansion of its seven manmade islands in the Spratly archipelago, including with hangers, runways, radars and missiles. This year's summit comes at a time of uncertainty about U.S. interests in the region and whether it will maintain its maritime presence to counter Chinese assertiveness that has often put the region on edge. A spokesman for the Philippines foreign ministry said a statement would be issued on Saturday. Two ASEAN diplomatic sources earlier on Saturday told Reuters that Chinese embassy representatives in Manila had sought to influence the content of the communique. The sources said the Chinese officials had lobbied the Philippines to keep tacit references to Beijing's island-building and arming of artificial islands out of the statement. But an unpublished draft dated Friday and seen by Reuters included the term \"land reclamation and militarization\", which were not featured in a draft two days earlier. The diplomats said four ASEAN member states had objected to it being omitted. China is not a member of ASEAN and was not attending the summit. China's embassy in Manila could not be reached and its foreign ministry did not respond to request for comment. The content of Friday's draft would indicate ASEAN was resisting moves by China to keep its contentious activities in the strategic South China Sea off ASEAN's official agenda. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who chaired Saturday's meeting, did not answer a question after the summit about whether the statement would refer to \"militarization\". He said ASEAN wanted to complete a framework for a maritime code of conduct with Beijing this year to defuse tensions (para. 1-12). Mogato, M. & Cruz, E. (2017).

Good point. PRC on track to #2 blue-water navy, behind USA and force projection ability in SCS and Western Pacific. Still see a narrowly-defined Zone on the horizon.  Power Projection: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_projection\nPower projection (or force projection) is a term used in military and political science to refer to the capacity of a state \"to apply all or some of its elements of national power - political, economic, informational, or military - to rapidly and effectively deploy and sustain forces in and from multiple dispersed locations to respond to crises, to contribute to deterrence, and to enhance regional stability.\"\nThis ability is a crucial element of a state's power in international relations. Any state able to direct its military forces outside the limited bounds of its territory might be said to have some level of power projection capability, but the term itself is used most frequently in reference to militaries with a worldwide reach (or at least significantly broader than a state's immediate area). Even states with sizable hard power assets (such as a large standing army) may only be able to exert limited regional influence so long as they lack the means of effectively projecting their power on a global scale. Generally, only a select few states are able to overcome the logistical difficulties inherent in the deployment and direction of a modern, mechanized military force.\nWhile traditional measures of power projection typically focus on hard power assets (tanks, soldiers, aircraft, naval vessels, etc.), the developing theory of soft power notes that power projection does not necessarily have to involve the active use of military forces in combat. Assets for power projection can often serve dual uses, as the deployment of various countries' militaries during the humanitarian response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake illustrates. The ability of a state to project its forces into an area may serve as an effective diplomatic lever, influencing the decision-making process and acting as a potential deterrent on other states' behavior.\nSource: Wikipedia Incremental adjustment down due to IFP time constraints."], [368, "2017-04-29T19:08:59Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-04-29T12:11:52Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-04-29T06:52:07Z", [0.0], ""], [29591, "2017-04-28T20:01:42Z", [0.06], "China is trying to impose its sovereignty in alternative ways to an ADIZ. \u201cChina\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress Standing Committee, a top-law making body, passed a revised version of China\u2019s surveying and mapping law intended to safeguard the security of China\u2019s geographic information\u201d lawmakers told reporters in Beijing. \n\u201cWhen asked about maps that \u201cincorrectly draw the countries boundaries\u201d by labelling Taiwan a country or not recognising China\u2019s claims in the South China Sea, He Shaoren said \u201cThese problems objectively damage the completeness of our national territory\u201d.

Although some Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) leaders will express \"serious concern\" over the \"escalation of activities\" in the disputed sea, ASEAN will drop references, or even allusions, to China's construction of artificial islands and the military hardware it has placed on them, according excerpts of the draft seen by Reuters. The statement would be a watered-down version of that issued last year and comes amid a charm offensive by Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who takes the rotating ASEAN chair this year, to court China for its business and avoid rows over sovereignty in the South China Sea. However, a diplomat from the ASEAN secretariat told Reuters, that officials were still working on the draft of the statement and \"it may still change\" before it is issued at the end of the summit on Saturday. China claims almost entire South China Sea where about $5 trillion worth of sea-borne goods pass every year. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have conflicting claims on the strategic waterway. ASEAN references to the South China Sea issue typically do not name China, which has been expanding its seven manmade islands in the Spratlys, including with hangers, runways, radars and surface-to-air missiles. Last year's ASEAN statement in Laos emphasized the importance of \"non-militarisation and self-restraint in the conduct of all activities, including land reclamation\". According to the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, China will soon be capable of deploying fighter jets on three of its reefs. China insists its activities are for defense purposes and are taking place in what it considers its sovereign waters. The Philippines irked China two months ago when its then foreign minister, Perfecto Yasay, said he and ASEAN counterparts had noticed \"very unsettlingly\" that weapons systems had been installed, and considered that \"a militarization of the region\". The foreign minister of the former administration, Alberto del Rosario, on Tuesday said the Philippines' hosting of ASEAN summit was an opportunity for Duterte to raise China's militarization. \"We should utilize our leadership to be able to uphold the rule of law,\" he said. \"The leadership of the Philippines will lose a lot of influence if we pass up that opportunity\" (para. 1-11).

Just before the two leaders sat down to dine on steak, Trump authorised a major unilateral use of force, with the US military firing 59 cruise missiles against a Syrian military airfield in retaliation for President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s use of chemical weapons against civilians days earlier.\nWhen Trump informed Xi of the strike later in the evening, the subtext was likely laid on so thick that Xi could have cut it with his steak knife: the United States remains a superpower and the only country both capable and willing of this sort of unilateral action. Tellingly, the Chinese Foreign Ministry, while noting the strike, did not offer outright condemnation.\nIf this wasn\u2019t a moment of humiliation for Xi with nationalistic audiences back home looking for signs of strength against a US leader who had been vocal about pushing back against China, it was at least a moment of forced weakness.\nAs Xi told Trump as they sat down to dine, China saw \u201ca thousand reasons to make the China-US relationship work; [there is] no reason to break it\u201d. We have little evidence that the Trump administration planned the authorisation of the Syria strike to coincide with the summit or to send China any particular message, but the timing was an uncanny reminder for Beijing of the differences that remain between the US and China; that the two remain near-peers in the realm of contemporary great powers, and not absolute peers as China would will it.\nWhat\u2019s more, the strike all but bumped what should have been a major moment in US-China relations to below-the-fold as global media immediately seized on the Trump administration\u2019s dalliance with unilateralism in the Middle East. Indeed, just as unexpected conflagrations in the region stemming from the Arab Uprisings drew attention away from the Obama administration\u2019s \u201crebalance\u201d to Asia, so did Trump\u2019s Syria strikes depress the significance of the Mar-a-Lago meeting.\nEven if unintentional, Xi may have drawn important lessons from Trump\u2019s decision on Thursday evening to authorise strikes on Syria. The decision represented both a capricious reversal in policy and a dangerously impulsive willingness to escalate. For China, whose foreign policy bureaucracy continues to wrangle with the overall direction of Trump\u2019s foreign policy amid mixed signals, factoring these tendencies in US decision-making on the North Korean problem and the South China Sea will be a necessity.\" Japan Times, April 6, 'Fighter jet spotted on South China Sea island, more believed in hangars: U.S. think tank': http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/04/07/asia-pacific/fighter-jet-spotted-south-china-sea-islet-believed-hangars-u-s-think-tank/#.WOqIHFPyt8c\nClips from Times article:\n\"The Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative (AMTI), part of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the J-11 fighter jet was visible on a runway in a satellite photo taken March 29 of Woody Island in the disputed waterway\u2019s Paracel chain.

Article 1 of the 1958 Convention of the High Seas states: \u2018The term \u201chigh seas\u201d means all parts of the sea that are not included in the territorial sea or internal waters of a state\u201d. (www.gc.noaa.gov/documents/8_1_1958_high_seas.pdf)  The conditions under which China could implement an ADIZ in the South China Sea:  \u201cADIZs are applied mostly during peacetime, \u201cprohibited areas\u201d or \u201crestricted areas\u201d of a States land areas or territorial waters over which the flight of the aircraft is restricted or prohibited and \u201cdanger areas\u201d within or over which activities there may exist constituting a potential danger to aircraft flying over it\u201d. It is possible that China could apply this condition to implement an ADIZ, if they have weaponised the disputed islands with missiles, therefore compromising the safety of aircraft flying over - however this is not recognised as Chinese territory so I doubt this argument would hold. \nArticle 9 of the Chicago convention, recognises a parties right \u201cin exceptional circumstances or during a period of emergency, or in the interest of public safety, and with immediate effects, temporarily to restrict or prohibit flying over the whole or any part of its territory\u201d, but not over high seas. Airspace beyond sovereign territory is free for international air navigation.\n\u201cThe right of a state to establish an ADIZ derives from its inherent right to self-defence. However, the UN charter only allows States to invoke this right in response to an armed attack.\u201d This relates back to the initial purpose of ADIZs which came about in the Cold-war era to warn off nuclear strikes by long-range bombers. \n(Source: \u2018The East China Sea Air Defense Identification Zone and International Law, Chinese Journal of International Law (Volume 14, Issue 2), June 2015\u2019 https://academic.oup.com/chinesejil/article-abstract/14/2/271/391978/The-East-China-Sea-Air-Defense-Identification-Zone). Would just like to mention, I found some of the writing in this article biased, as it is written from Chinese perspective, but I have checked the facts against the UNCLOS.  In terms of the applicability of an ADIZ in the South China Sea beyond China\u2019s EEZ: \u201cThe Chicago Convention recognises all states complete and exclusive sovereignty over airspace above their territory, defined as \u201cthe land areas and territorial waters adjacent thereto under the sovereignty, suzerainty, protection or mandate of such State\u201d. It is implicit that areas beyond, such complete and exclusive sovereignty cannot be validly claimed ipso facto.\u201d (Chinese Journal of International Law). This can be seen in Article 89 of the UNCLOS: \u201cNo state may validly purport to subject any part of the high seas to its sovereignty\u201d. As an ADIZ is about protecting ones Sovereignty, China cannot claim the South China Sea as their territory, therefore an ADIZ would be invalid. If China were to declare an ADIZ off the South Coast they cannot legally shoot down any civilian aircraft under the Chicago Convention (1984), recognising \u201cevery state must refrain from resorting to the use of weapons against civil aircraft in flight and that in case of interceptions the lives of the persons on board and the safety of the aircraft must not be endangered\u201d. \u201cIn case of non-compliance, fighters may be scrambled to verify the intentions of unidentified aircraft by standard ICAO visual signs established in Annex 2 of the Chicago convention. In critical situations the interceptor may initiate a divert manoeuvre such as flying across the intercepted aircrafts flight path, rocking its wings, or flashing external lights/select afterburners, or rolling out in the direction the intercepted aircraft is expected to turn. These measures do not amount to threat or use of force as prohibited by Article 2(4) of the Charter, nor do they involve the use of weapons.\u201d (Chinese Journal of International Law)  However, in relation to what China can do to foreign military aircraft; the Chicago Convention is not applicable to State aircraft, which includes military. This means that for both sides the regulations aren't really there so it is up to the States involved to interpret the laws as they wish.\nThe US does not recognise ADIZs of foreign nations when: \u201cforeign aircraft is not intending to enter national airspace, nor does the US apply its ADIZ procedures to foreign aircraft not intending to enter US airspace\u201d - US Navy Commanders Handbook on the Law of Naval Operations. (http://www.jag.navy.mil/documents/NWP_1-14M_Commanders_Handbook.pdf)  While China could try to implement an ADIZ over the South China Sea off of the South coast of China, it is not legal for them to do so over the disputed islands in the South China Sea, such as the Parcel Islands, Macclesfield Bank, Scarborough Shoal and the Spratly Islands. Article 60.4 of the UNCLOS states: \u201cThe Coastal state may, where necessary establish reasonable safety zones around such artificial islands, installations and structures in which it may take appropriate measures to ensure the safety both of navigation and of artificial islands, installations and structures\u201d. This is only valid within a States EEZ. Since none of the aforementioned disputed islands are within China\u2019s EEZ, they cannot implement a safety zone.

China claims most of the resource-rich South China Sea, through which about $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes every year. Neighbors Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims on the strategic waterway. The United States estimates Beijing has added more than 3,200 acres (1,300 hectares) of land on seven features in the South China Sea over the past three years, building runways, ports, aircraft hangars and communications equipment. The United States has conducted a series of freedom-of-navigation operations in the South China Sea, raising tensions between Washington and Beijing (para. 1-6). Packham, C. (2017.)

The introduction of an ADIZ over the South China Sea would be solely for military purposes, as no country has threatened to go to war with China recently. This leads me to think that China does not need an ADIZ, as its just an official way of stating what they are already doing to the various foreign militaries. An article on The Diplomat published on the 12th March stated \u201cThe Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army- Navy will continue to shadow foreign military vessels and intercept aircraft in the SCS, according to comments last week by a senior PLAN official\u201d (http://thediplomat.com/2017/03/chinas-navy-will-intercept-and-follow-military-vessels-and-aircraft/)  In May 2015 \u201cChina gave at least 6 warnings to the Philippine air force and navy planes to leave areas around the disputed South China Sea\u201d. A commander of the Philippine Western Command said \u201cAs we were conducting routine maritime air patrols and flying in international airspace, our airforce aircraft was challenged over the radio\u201d (http://uk.businessinsider.com/china-orders-philippine-military-to-leave-disputed-areas-of-south-china-sea-2015-5?r=US&IR=T)  In September 2015, a US spy plane was flying over Fiery Cross reef, where China was constructing an early warning radar station on reclaimed land. The US plane was ordered 8 times to leave the airspace despite the pilots pointing out they were in international airspace.
