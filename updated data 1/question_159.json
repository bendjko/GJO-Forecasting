What I mean is that polls (i.e., 538 and Upshot) measure intent.  Who is in who's tent, and who intends to vote.  What we want to know is who is doing what - again, what the ground game is, who is early voting.  This article gives one peak in the window of the Democrat's get out the vote efforts in Nevada.   Note that I worry I am moving from facts and numbers to innuendo and anecdotal evidence.  I have read that early voting does indicate trends, and I have read the reverse.  An example is Trump saying his rallies are huge and have huge energy.  That doesn't tell me how a state will vote.  But, I believe that this article does tell us something important about Nevada. OK, here's my final forecast. Democrats will pick up Illinois, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and either Missouri, New Hampshire or North Carolina.  D's will be 51, R's will be 49. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_elections,_2016\nhttp://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/senate/ This is important, since the Virginia seat being left by Kaine will likely be filled by the Democratic governor and be a Democrat.  But, there will be a special election the following year.  Then, the seat naturally comes up on the 6 year cycle in 2 years - thus another election.  Lots of opportunity for folks to get pissed at Washington, and vote out the incumbent.  Incumbents have a huge advantage, but the next few years in Virginia are going to be wild.  And the Senate could flip a few times based upon it.    https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/01/why-the-battle-for-control-of-the-senate-could-stretch-into-2017/"], [14182, "2016-11-07T06:07:57Z", [0.67, 0.33], ""], [10267, "2016-11-07T05:55:24Z", [1.0, 0.0], ""], [767, "2016-11-07T03:27:08Z", [0.6, 0.4], "Some pundits saying today that the Comey letter may not cost Clinton the presidency after all, but that it's looking more likely to cost the DEMS the senate.

Assuming that the Senate continues to block any nominee of President Obama, confirmation will be left to the newly elected Senate in 2017.

Let's see if we can break this down to make the above argument a little more rigorous:  - Of the seats that are up for grabs, there are 11 with a reasonable probability of going either way. \n- Before analyzing these 11, the D's have 45 seats and the R's have 44. \nOf the remaining eleven:  - Nevada looks pretty close to tied (As of now I give a 48% chance Dems win) \n- Arizona looks like it'll go Republican: John McCain's name recognition/incumbency coupled with some not so new polls (Dems 20%)\n- Missouri looks like it'll go Republican though it'll be closer than one would expect (Dems 35%)\n- Illinois will likely go Blue (though there was no polling I could find, so I'm basing on Illinois leaning blue) -- Dems (70%)\n- Indiana (will Evan Bayh make it close?) -- (Dems 40%) \n- Ohio (looks like R's have a slight edge) -- (Dems 45%)\n- Pennsylvania (looks like R's have a slight edge) -- (Dems 45%)\n- Florida (Rubio's polling ahead) -- (Dems 35%)\n- New Hampshire (Slight R lead so far ) -- (Dems 45%)\n- North Carolina -- (Dems 50%)\n- Wisconsin looks like it'll go Blue (Dems 90%) - Admittedly, my estimates are rough and possibly pessimistic if you're a Democrat, considering they are coming on the heals of a bad polling week for Dems. Nevertheless, the numbers are the numbers.  - Running a computer simulation with these odds gives the democrats at least 4 seats about 85% (Relevant if Hillary wins, which I'm giving 70%) of the time and at least 5 seats about 66% of the time (Relevant if Trump wins -- 30%).  - Final estimate: 0.85*0.7 + 0.66*0.3 = approximately 0.81 References: \nhttp://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/senate/nv/nevada_senate_heck_vs_cortez_masto-5982.html\nhttp://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/senate/mo/missouri_senate_blunt_vs_kander-5631.html\nhttp://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/senate/wi/wisconsin_senate_johnson_vs_feingold-3740.html\nhttp://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/senate/oh/ohio_senate_portman_vs_strickland-5386.html\nhttp://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/senate/fl/florida_senate_rubio_vs_murphy-5222.html\nhttp://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/senate/nh/new_hampshire_senate_ayotte_vs_hassan-3862.html\nhttp://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/governor/nc/north_carolina_governor_mccrory_vs_cooper-4096.html"], [6303, "2016-07-18T00:53:22Z", [0.75, 0.25], "According to the general news and GJP consensus.

Edit: Hmm. Thinking about this. Since \"writing off\" Pennsylvania ad spending is such an unusual move, I'm now wondering if the proffered narrative that the Clinton campaign believes Pennsylvania is \"in the bag\" is the proper analysis. Perhaps the Clinton campaign is privy to some information that the general public is not. I've already made reference to the ongoing political corruption investigations in Pennsylvania.

I think it is unlikely that HRC would choose Sen. Warren as her running mate, but notice that if she did, and the Clinton/Warren ticket won the White House, there would be consequences for control of the Senate. Massachusetts has a Republican Governor who would, presumably, choose a fellow Republican to replace Sen. Warren in the upper chamber. True, an election for a replacement would follow in 145-160 days[2]. But there's no guarantee that the electorate would return a Democrat. As recently as 2010, Republican Scott Brown was elected to the Senate by the voters of the mayflower state. That fact alone might be a deal-breaker for a Clinton/Warren ticket. But if it's not, control of the Senate might be even harder to predict.  -- [1]http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2016/05/hillary_clinton_should_pick_elizabeth_warren_as_her_running_mate.html\n[2] http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/vacancies-in-the-united-states-senate.aspx"], [23681, "2016-05-13T16:02:37Z", [0.7, 0.3], ""], [691, "2016-05-13T14:15:04Z", [0.77, 0.23], ""], [23169, "2016-05-13T08:43:37Z", [0.75, 0.25], ""], [12105, "2016-05-13T06:15:07Z", [0.62, 0.38], ""], [368, "2016-05-12T19:33:25Z", [0.85, 0.15], ""], [21800, "2016-05-12T17:26:19Z", [0.57, 0.43], "Minor update.

The party has raised $135 million this election, but what is deeply concerning to many Republican candidates, contributors and strategists is that it only had a little more than $16 million on hand, along with nearly $2 million in debt, at the end of March. Mr. Spicer stressed that this was partly because the committee had already begun paying to send staff members to battleground states, well ahead of the same time four years ago. \"But the party\u2019s modest cash availability underscores how much hangs in the balance with its nominee. The minute Trump gets the nomination, the party is going to have to raise another three or four hundred million,\u201d said Al Hoffman, a Florida-based Republican donor. . . .  Mr. Hoffman, a former R.N.C. finance chairman, . . .  said he had little appetite to raise money for a Trump-led party and would probably focus his efforts this year on helping a local House candidate and assisting the re-election of his friend, Senator John McCain of Arizona. And he emphasized that he was not alone. \u201cAll the donors I\u2019ve talked to have said they want to sit out the presidential and just focus on the Senate and House,\u201d Mr. Hoffman said. \"Ray Washburne, a Republican fund-raiser from Dallas who also previously served as a national committee finance chairman, said, \u201cThere\u2019s a big switch to doing the Senate races and trying to hold onto the Senate.\u201d\n. . . \n\". . .  unease about Mr. Trump, along with the dislike many of the party\u2019s business-oriented donors have for the hard-line Mr. Cruz, has prompted the R.N.C. to begin privately assuring donors that it will create a so-called Senate Trust fund. Money earmarked for that fund will go entirely to initiatives aimed at retaining the Senate \u2014 including hiring field operatives and opposition researchers and bolstering digital efforts. . . .  \"The situation is particularly urgent in Florida, the largest of the traditional presidential swing states, which this year is holding a wide-open contest for Senator Marco Rubio\u2019s seat, the outcome of which could determine control of the Senate. The usually well-funded Florida Republican Party has encountered financial difficulties since Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s preferred candidate for state party chairman was rejected last year, making it more reliant on national assistance. What is more, the sort of get-out-the-vote efforts that are typically funded by the parties are especially crucial in Florida, because many of its voters cast absentee ballots or take advantage of early voting. \u201cWe\u2019ve never not had a robust absentee and early-voting program in Florida,\u201d said David Johnson, a longtime Republican strategist here.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  This shifting in RNC fundraising and campaign support from the presidential race to the Senate (& House) races suggests several things to me:\n1)  the difficulty the RNC is having with fundraising bodes ill, I'd think, for the success of the Trump campaign\n2)  the RNC's decision to shift fundraising and spending to Senate (& House) races suggests to me a concern that GOP control of the  Senate could be lost and a belief that it could be retained if adequate resources were devoted to the effort to do so. I don't recall a party ever before severing its support for its presidential candidate from support for down-ticket races.  Usually, the thinking is that \"a rising tide raises all boats\" and that they way to bring the tide in is to win the presidency.   This is a very interesting situation:  dual fundraising efforts--presidential and congressional, with a greater emphasis on the down-ticket races.  In general, I think the RNC's decision to shift fundraising to Senate races is very clear-eyed, rational and wise.

Unanimously rated likely Republican. \nNevada - Harry Reid (D) isn't running. Unanimously rated a toss-up. \nNew Hampshire - Kelly Ayotte (R) incumbent, but also a potential VP pick. Rated a toss-up by three of four outlets, slightly Republican by the fourth. Polling shows a competitive race with a Republican edge. \nNorth Carolina - Richard Burr (R) incumbent. Rated lean or likely Republican by all four outlets. Polling shows a competitive race with a Republican lead.\nOhio - Rob Portman (R) incumbent. Rated a tossup by one outlet, a lean Republican by three others. Polling shows a competitive race with a Democrat edge.\nPennsylvania - Pat Toomey (R) incumbent. Rated a tossup by one outlet, a lean Republican by three others. Polling shows a Republican lead. \nWisconsin - Ron Johnson (R) incumbent. Rated a tossup by tow outlets, a lean Democrat by two others. Polling shows a Democrat lead.  This really does look too close to call at this stage, particularly with so many primaries still undecided. Having said that, the decisive factor for me at this point is the Republican primary race, which will certainly have down-ballot effects. Donald trump's negative favourability ratings have been well-publicized, but Ted Cruz also has a -19 spread according to the latest RCP average (http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/cruz_favorableunfavorable-3887.html). That's five points worse than Clinton, despite the fact that Clinton is far better known and (in my view) that has shielded Cruz somewhat from how far from centre his voting record is.  In either case, Democratic get out the vote efforts seem likely to be more effective than their Republican equivalents, which could be decisive in any number of close Senate races.\n"], [18551, "2016-04-04T21:07:12Z", [0.45, 0.55], ""], [11341, "2016-04-04T20:59:58Z", [0.55, 0.45], ""], [691, "2016-04-04T20:15:46Z", [0.53, 0.47], ""], [613, "2016-04-04T19:28:07Z", [0.5, 0.5], "Since Republicans have been taking a beating by the general public, there is a chance that they could lose the Senate due to their obstructionism."], [100, "2016-04-04T17:56:08Z", [0.25, 0.75], ""], [368, "2016-04-04T17:52:59Z", [0.75, 0.25], ""], [22675, "2016-04-04T17:29:21Z", [0.25, 0.75], ""], [4634, "2016-04-04T17:02:15Z", [0.78, 0.22], ""], [10759, "2016-04-04T17:01:57Z", [0.78, 0.22], ""], [14201, "2016-04-04T16:25:59Z", [0.61, 0.39], ""], [939, "2016-04-04T16:03:56Z", [0.3, 0.7], ""], [23472, "2016-04-04T13:37:38Z", [0.55, 0.45], ""], [136, "2016-04-04T07:00:23Z", [0.55, 0.45], ""], [20623, "2016-04-04T03:17:02Z", [0.48, 0.52], ""], [94, "2016-04-04T03:14:54Z", [0.63, 0.37], "http://predictwise.com/politics/2016-congress-senate"], [7349, "2016-04-04T01:11:17Z", [0.55, 0.45], ""], [12302, "2016-04-04T00:28:56Z", [0.7, 0.3], ""], [18431, "2016-04-03T23:44:59Z", [0.67, 0.33], ""], [23414, "2016-04-03T22:59:36Z", [0.48, 0.52], ""], [16291, "2016-04-03T22:22:25Z", [0.7, 0.3], ""], [14253, "2016-04-03T21:58:01Z", [0.5, 0.5], ""], [14448, "2016-04-03T21:47:55Z", [0.45, 0.55], ""], [13239, "2016-04-03T21:42:24Z", [0.67, 0.33], ""], [1023, "2016-04-03T21:31:43Z", [0.15, 0.85], "Republicans may lose a seat or two, however retain majority in Senate."], [6628, "2016-04-03T21:26:42Z", [0.55, 0.45], ""], [14613, "2016-04-03T19:47:15Z", [0.49, 0.51], ""], [368, "2016-04-03T19:45:40Z", [0.75, 0.25], ""], [691, "2016-04-03T18:03:09Z", [0.53, 0.47], ""], [23446, "2016-04-03T15:01:38Z", [0.7, 0.3], ""], [36, "2016-04-03T13:11:38Z", [1.0, 0.0], ""], [10039, "2016-04-03T05:43:09Z", [0.75, 0.25], ""], [2869, "2016-04-03T04:26:23Z", [0.3, 0.7], ""], [22833, "2016-04-03T04:04:00Z", [0.66, 0.34], ""], [17033, "2016-04-03T03:52:36Z", [0.55, 0.45], "This one is a coin-flip, but I'll give Democrats the edge on the assumption that GOP will nominate either Cruz or Trump and the party will go down in a landslide, taking the Senate with it.

Republicans need to have a winning percentage of 0.64 (not 0.65 as I had thought) or higher in the 17 competitive races in order to end up with 51 or more seats in the senate. According to the 4-source model I used last time, the probability of that happening is 0.44. In contrast, Democrats need to have a winning percentage of 0.46 (rather than 0.47) or higher in the 17 competitive races in order to end up with 51 or more seats in the senate. According to the 4-source model I used last time, the probability of that happening is 0.2578 (call it 0.26).

Since I currently think that neither Republicans nor Democrats have a clear leg up in the presidential race (or, more accurately, I believe that it's too soon to tell since polling data at this stage of the campaign is not reliably predictive for general election results), I'm just giving both the Republicans and Democrats an even chance of winning the White House and, therefore, having control of the Senate were we to have a 50/50 tie. So Republicans come out as about a 3-to-2 favorite to retain control of the Senate.  But what if, in line with the current GJ consensus, you think that the the Democrats have about a 2-to-1 advantage in the general election for president, instead of the even money line I'm taking?

"], [14531, "2016-03-24T19:59:58Z", [0.41, 0.59], "I agree with @Jean-Pierre and others that it's too soon to determine, with much precision, probabilities for this question. That said, we're getting there. Since this is my initial forecast, I'll just try to develop a reasonable prior. Here are the basic facts (which you can skip if you're already in-the-know): There are 34 seats are up for re-election. 24 are currently held by Republicans, and 10 are held by Democrats. Since there are 54 Republicans in the Senate now, that means that the Republicans can count on a bare minimum of 30 seats after the election, and the Democrats can count on a bare minimum of 36 seats. (I'm counting the 2 independents who caucus with the Democrats as Democrats for now, but I'll revisit this point later.)  17 of the seats up for election are functionally out of play. 10 of these are held by Republicans, so they can really count on 40 seats after the election. The other 7 are held by Democrats, so their floor is really 43 seats. Of the 17 seats that are competitive to one degree or another, 14 of these competitive seats are currently held by Republicans and 3 are held by Democrats. So much for the basic facts. It would be nice to have some sense of how likely it is that a Democrat or a Republican will win each of these 17 competitive elections.  And Wikipedia (of all places!) provides some raw useful information to this end[a]. (You can see this table here: https://pythagorassite.wordpress.com/2016/03/24/which-party-will-control-the-us-senate-after-the-november-2016-election/) The final four columns of this table list estimates of how likely each of these Senatorial seats is to go to either a Republican or a Democrat. The estimates come from the Cook Report, the University of Virginia Center for Politics, Roll Call, and the Daily Kos. Since these are qualitative assessments, and we need quantitative assessments, I (somewhat arbitrarily) came up with the following cypher: Safe D = 0.90 probability of D victory\nLikely D = 0.75 probability of D victory\nLean D/Tilt D = 0.60 probability of D victory\nTossup = just what it sounds like, 0.50 probability of D victory And, of course, I did the same for Republicans. I'm certainly open to better translation of the qualitative assessments into quantitative assessments, but this seems like a reasonable place to start. My next step was to average the four quantitative assessments. While I didn't weight any of the sources of these assessments, I was tempted to give the Cook Report added weight because of its reputation for accuracy[b]. Again, I'm open to better approaches. Next, I determined the mean, median, and standard deviation of the average assessments. (You can see this table here: https://pythagorassite.wordpress.com/2016/03/24/which-party-will-control-the-us-senate-after-the-november-2016-election/) Hence, for any given competitive Senate seat, the expected value to the Republicans is 0.61, and the expected value to the Democrats is 0.39. And the most likely outcome is that Republican end up with 50.5 Senate seats, while Democrats get 49.5. Of course, there's a small problem here - namely, that actual Senate seats come in discrete quantities along the lines of the positive integers. No one is going to end up with 0.583774 of a Senate seat any time soon! But the magic of numbers[c] comes to the rescue again. We know that in order to retain their majority in the Senate, Republicans will need to win 11 of the 17 seats up for grabs in these competitive races, since they have a floor of 40 seats. And 11/17 = 0.65, rounding up a bit. Furthermore, we know that the standard deviation for the data series I mentioned is 0.20[d], which you can take my word for if you don't want to do your own calculation. Given this data, there's a 0.4207 (call it 0.42) probability that the Republicans will retain 51 or more Senate seats in this election cycle. Contrariwise, Democrats need 8 of the 17 Senate seats, since they have a floor of 43 seats. And 8/17 is about 0.47. Given all of the data we have, we can estimate a 0.242 probability of that happening.  But here's the thing. Eagle-eyed readers will surely have noted that 0.4207 (the probability of Republicans retaining control of the Senate) + 0.242 (the probability of the Democrats seizing control of the Senate) does not equal 1. That's because there's a rather remarkable 0.3373 probability that we'll see 50 Republicans and 50 Democrats in the Senate, according to the (admittedly overly) simple model I've pieced together! That's a big surprise to me. Here are 2 take aways from this fact: To start with, GJ needs to step up and tell us how they mean to score this event if there's a 50/50 split in the Senate. For practical purposes, of course, control will rest in the hands of the party that has the tie-breaking vote, and that will be whichever party wins the presidential election. If that's what GJ has in mind, I hope they'll say so soon (and I apologize if they've already done so, but I've missed it). Furthermore, if the importance of the presidential election didn't seem clear enough to me before, it certainly does now. The outcome of the presidential election has a more than 1-in-3 chance of determining which party has control of the Senate. That's huge. The upshot for the time being: I'm going to assign each party half of the value of 0.3373, but that's just a temporary fix.  Four more points need to be made: First, the two independents in the Senate are Angus King (ME) and Bernie Sanders (VT). Both Sen. King and Sen. Sanders caucus as Democrats. Hell, Sen. Sanders is running to be the Democratic nominee for president in 2016. So it's pretty safe to think of them as Democrats, though it would be very nice to have confirmation from the GJ judges on this point. By the way, neither Sen. King nor Sen. Sanders is up for reelection this year, as they are both Class 1 Senators.  Second, I haven't tried to use any historical data to help guide my forecasting, and that worries me. I believe that there's a rough-and-ready tendency for the party who has a two-term president completing his time in office to lose Senate seats[e]. But I need to do more homework on this before I try to upgrade my little toy of a model. Third, I've treated the Senate elections as if they were independent variables. That's something of a fiction. Senate elections are likely to be deeply influenced by the presidential election, and there's long been speculation that a Trump candidacy could be a disaster for Republicans in Congress[f]. But this election cycle has been pretty damn hard to predict. (The good news: It's not *boring*. The bad news: It's *not* boring.) So I'm going to put a pin in this until there's enough solid empirical data to use. (And, for Pete's sake, please tell me if there is, and I'm not in the loop.) Fourth and finally, all of this bean counting gets scrambled if a Senator dies or has to leave office. \"The U.S. Constitution grants the state legislatures the power to determine how U.S. Senators are to be replaced, including empowering the chief executive (the governor) do make these appointments\"[g]. Since Republican governors outnumber Democratic governors more than 3-to-2[h], and Republicans control a little more than twice as many State legislatures as Democrats[i]. So Republicans have a huge advantage - an advantage I don't yet have a way of incorporating into my forecast. -- [a] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_elections,_2016 [b] http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~jcampbel/documents/CookAccuracySummary.pdf [c] http://jwilson.coe.uga.edu/EMAT6680Fa06/Hobgood/Pythagoras.html [d] Our old friend Andrey Kolmogorov reminds us that all probability values fall between 0 and 1, inclusive[c]. So we need to be a bit careful about using the standard deviation here. If we has a perfectly normal distribution, then 0.025 of the data would sit north of 1.0, while about 0.0011 would be south of 0. I'll just fix that on the fly.

Also, I don't see any issue as emotive as Obamacare this time,. \n4. It looks like the economy will continue to grow, though probably at a slower rate, and though there is a possibility of foreign policy setbacks (Iran, Syria etc) it is more likely there won't be.\n5.Contrasted to the Republican candidates, the Democrats appear in much better shape, and Obama's own popularity graph seems to be rising above his earlier lows.\n6. If the Republicans lose 5 seats out of their 24, they'll end up with 49 and without a majority. With the conditions listed above helping the Democrats, a loss of 5 seats seems more likely than not.\n7.

Donald Trump is the Republican nominee, which likely means that there will be at least a modest wave (or down-ballot effect) that favors the Democrats. \n2.

It appears to be trending upwards recently and currently sits at 52%. As of right now, I'd say that the Democrats are poised to win 4+ seats, which is enough to take them to a 50/50 split in the Senate and with an HRC win, that puts the tie-breaking vote with the Democrats (i.e. the majority)."], [14327, "2016-03-12T05:25:32Z", [0.65, 0.35], "Things may be clearer after March 15th.
