Mueller III is setting a curious pattern as he squeezes cooperation and guilty pleas out of suspects in his investigation, one that suggests he may be nearing the end of his work. When President Trump\u2019s former lawyer Michael Cohen was sentenced in federal court in New York on Wednesday, he became the latest Mueller target to be accused of a crime, flip and provide evidence against others, and then be sentenced before having to testify in court. In the cases of Cohen, former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and former national security adviser Michael Flynn, Mueller has proceeded to the sentencing of each without first making him testify at trial against others. That\u2019s at odds with the common practice of prosecutors \u2014 which is to hold the stick of a tougher prison sentence over defendants until they have completed all of their cooperation, particularly any public testimony. While the recent legal action has led to speculation that prosecutors are narrowing in on the president in anticipation of more criminal charges, Mueller\u2019s sentencing timeline suggests a different outcome to some legal experts \u2014 that the accounts of those cooperating witnesses will appear in a written report, not in court. Cooperators \u201cusually go last,\u201d said Robert Ray, a former independent counsel on the Whitewater investigation. The sentencing of those Mueller defendants \u201csuggests to me that whatever those individuals have done for the special counsel investigation, there is no further use for them,\u201d Ray said. \u201cIf there were any contemplation of using them at trial, you would sentence them later. And the only conclusion I can draw from all that is that we are nearing the end.\u201d Ray said he expects Mueller to deliver a report on his findings in the first three months of 2019. Mueller may also be willing to proceed quickly to sentencing cooperators in part because he expects to present more information in a report than at any trials. A spokesman for Mueller declined to comment.\n. . .\nOnly one of the known criminal cooperators in Mueller\u2019s cases has been handled in the more traditional manner: Rick Gates. Gates pleaded guilty to financial crimes, testified at trial against his former boss Manafort, and is awaiting sentencing. That approach can leave a valuable witness waiting for many years to receive their sentence. One of the longest and most famous examples is Jamal al-Fadl, a former aide to Osama bin Laden who turned government witness and testified against al-Qaeda. He pleaded guilty in 1997, and although court records indicate a sentencing was scheduled in 2014, there\u2019s no record it actually occurred. Different factors can weigh on sentencing decisions, and Cohen\u2019s case was arguably the most complex that Mueller has handled, because it involves two separate cases prosecuted by two offices \u2014 Mueller\u2019s and the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan. Yet even there, potential witnesses were given their sentence before they had to speak at a trial against anyone else. Cohen got three years in prison for financial crimes, including hush-money payments during the 2016 campaign to keep quiet women who claimed to have had affairs with Trump. That sentencing incorporated the guilty plea Cohen struck with Mueller for lying to Congress about attempts during the 2016 presidential campaign to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. After his sentencing, the New York prosecutors also announced they had reached a deferred prosecution agreement with AMI, the parent company of the National Enquirer tabloid, for buying the silence of one of those women. Once again, prosecutors had taken away the threat of a possible prison sentence. \u201cThat is in contrast with how it\u2019s normally done,\u201d said Patrick Cotter, a former federal prosecutor now in private practice in Chicago. \u201cIn most large investigations, the way you do it is you make deals with whomever you\u2019re going to make a deal with, they plead guilty, but then their sentencing is delayed until the investigation and trial are over, and they get their big fish, and the cooperator testifies or doesn\u2019t. That is the very prevalent model.\u201d Prosecutors do it that way for a simple reason, Cotter said. Without the fear of a possible long sentence, a criminal \u201cmay lose his enthusiasm and flip back, and say he doesn\u2019t remember things he already testified to.\u201d In the Mueller probe, that\u2019s not just a hypothetical scenario. There are plenty of indications that, if called to testify, some of Mueller\u2019s cooperators could retract what they have already admitted about themselves and said about others. After pleading guilty to lying to the FBI, Papadopoulos, who recently completed his two-week jail sentence, has repeatedly suggested he was railroaded or framed. Flynn is awaiting sentencing next week, and his supporters have argued that he, too, was tricked into pleading guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with the Russian ambassador to the United States in late 2016. After being convicted at one trial, Manafort struck a cooperation deal to avoid trial on a second set of charges. Mueller now says Manafort broke the terms of the deal by repeatedly lying to prosecutors about key details in his case. Even the definition of cooperation has at times become strangely flexible in the Mueller probe. At Cohen\u2019s sentencing Tuesday, prosecutor Jeannie Rhee said Cohen had provided \u201ccredible and reliable information about core Russia-related issues under investigation.\u201d Yet the New York prosecutors who investigated Cohen\u2019s finances were far harsher, saying Cohen had refused to provide full cooperation and was holding back. Further complicating the issue, Cohen\u2019s lawyer Guy Petrillo said his client was still willing to cooperate even after he goes to prison \u2014 and suggested Cohen has been more honest than others caught in Mueller\u2019s crosshairs. \u201cHis action stands in profound contrast to the decision of some others not to cooperate and allegedly to double deal while pretending to cooperate,\u201d Petrillo said, in an apparent reference to Manafort. Ultimately, U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley III sentenced Cohen to three years in prison, finding Cohen\u2019s decision to volunteer some information to prosecutors but not all of what he knew \u201cdoes not wipe the slate clean.\u201d Sometimes a prosecutor will move ahead with sentencing cooperators because \u201cthe big fish got away,\u201d said Cotter, although he doesn\u2019t believe that is the reasoning in Mueller\u2019s case. Cotter said Mueller\u2019s decisions show he is confident that Manafort, Flynn, or Papadopoulos would stick to their story if they are ever called to testify at a criminal trial. He also suggested Mueller may have another, more subtle reason for his approach \u2014 to send a message to other potential witnesses. In that formulation, Mueller is providing an object lesson for the value of cooperation: Flynn, who cooperated early, is likely to get no prison time. Cohen, who cooperated somewhat, got several years in prison. Manafort, who failed to cooperate, is likely headed to prison for at least 10 years. \u201cNow, it\u2019s very credible to go to the next guy and say, \u2018You can be a Flynn, you can be a Cohen, or you can be a Manafort. Which is it going to be?\u2019,\u201d said Cotter. \u201cFor a prosecutor, that\u2019s a very powerful piece of advertising.\u201d\n~~~~~~~\nMY SUMMARY:  \" . . . Robert Ray, a former independent counsel on the Whitewater investigation, [said that] The sentencing of those Mueller defendants \u201csuggests to me that whatever those individuals have done for the special counsel investigation, there is no further use for them,\u201d Ray said. \u201cIf there were any contemplation of using them at trial, you would sentence them later. And the only conclusion I can draw from all that is that we are nearing the end.\u201d Ray said he expects Mueller to deliver a report on his findings in the first three months of 2019.\" COMMENT:  I accept this assessment of the status of Mueller's report.  However, there is still the possibility of a precipitous action by DJT, who, while he can't directly fire Mueller, can fire person after person in his chain of command at the DOJ until someone does what he demands.  Since DJT has a new candidate for AG, what does DJT have to lose if he has to fire Whitaker?   All the legal & political commentary is about how the circle of legal jeopardy is tightening around DJT, who doesn't strike me as someone who is cool under pressure.   I just can't go to zero because of the unpredictability of DJT. \n"], [705, "2018-12-17T03:34:00Z", [0.01], ""], [57778, "2018-12-16T22:59:51Z", [0.0], ""], [755, "2018-12-16T21:29:09Z", [0.02], "NBC News, December 16, 'Poll: 62 percent say Trump isn't telling the truth in Russia probe - More Americans want Democrats \u2014 not Trump \u2014 in charge of setting policy, a new national NBC News/WSJ poll finds' https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/poll-62-percent-say-trump-isn-t-telling-truth-russia-n948226 Comments: Under oath.

Lol PROUDLY POSTED FROM AMERCANTHINKER.COM December 2, 2018\u00a0\nAnother Turbulent Week with Some Big Mysteries\u00a0\nBy Clarice Feldman Still Winning This week the President signed a new trade deal with Mexico, Canada, and Argentina, a deal far more favorable to our interests than the now discarded NAFTA deal.\u00a0\nIn the same time frame, our master negotiator hosted the first trilateral meeting with Japan and India, which should also boost the economy and which includes defense and military purchases. Merry Christmas, Xi.\u00a0\nComey: Still a Loser\u00a0\nOn the home front, Mueller and Comey keep looking worse and worse. Previously, former FBI Director James Comey refused to answer 100 questions when he testified before Congress because the hearings were public. Now, the House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed him to take his deposition, allowing him to testify in a closed setting. He ran to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia seeking to quash the subpoena because he claimed his testimony might be selectively leaked. Judge Magistrate Trevor McFadden drew Comey\u2019s counsel\u2019s admission that there was no case law supporting his position. The government noted that Comey was free to publicly disclose his testimony after the deposition, and that, moreover, a transcript would be provided him 24 hours after his testimony which he was free to release in whole. Comey\u2019s counsel told Judge McFadden \u201cHere\u2019s your opportunity, judge to make some law.\u201d The judge said he would decide the case Monday at 10 a.m. I wouldn\u2019t bet that he\u2019ll make new law. The deposition, in the meantime, is now scheduled for this Tuesday. Doubtless, Comey is playing for time and the installation of a Democratic majority in the House and we can expect more shenanigans from the former FBI head.\u00a0\nTwo Mysteries\u00a0\n1. Chicago\u00a0\nWhile the President was out of the country the FBI raided the office of Chicago Alderman Ed Burke, a guy who controlled the city and state finances. The Feds ordered everyone to leave, placed brown paper over the doors and went through the files in Burke\u2019s office.\u00a0\nIs this Trump striking back? Is Obama\u2019s cover coming undone? The Chicago field office offered no comment. It\u2019s not clear they were even in the loop respecting this raid. Anti-Trumpers are salivating that this is another attempt to tar him, as his company hired Burke to handle permitting and tax issues to build in Chicago. Well, who didn\u2019t? Only people who didn\u2019t want building permits and favorable tax treatment.\u00a0\n2. Cain Raid in Maryland\u00a0\nMore distressing and inexplicable was the November 19 FBI raid on the home of Dennis Nathan Cain, a whistleblower who gave evidence that federal officials failed to investigate potential criminal activity respecting Hillary Clinton, the Clinton foundation, and Rosatom, the Russian company which purchased Uranium One to Inspector General Michael Horowitz and which was then properly transmitted to the Senate and House Intelligence committees. The law protects whistleblowers that follow the procedure Cain did. Nevertheless, the FBI charged that Cain possessed stolen government property and used this to obtain permission for the raid from federal magistrate Stephanie Gallagher. The details of this seemingly shocking use of the FBI were reported by crack investigative reporter Richard Pollack. For six hours agents rifled through Cain\u2019s home even after he handed over the documents to the FBI he\u2019d already given to Horowitz.\u00a0\nPollack notes:\u00a0\nThe delivered documents also show that then-FBI Director Robert Mueller failed to investigate allegations of criminal misconduct pertaining to Rosatom and to other Russian government entities attached to Uranium One, the document reviewed by The DCNF alleges. Mueller is now the special counsel investigating whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 election.\u00a0\n\u201cThe bureau raided my client to seize what he legally gave Congress about the Clinton Foundation and Uranium One,\u201d the whistleblower\u2019s lawyer, Michael Socarras, told the DCNF [Daily Caller News Foundation], noting that he considered the FBI\u2019s raid to be an \u201coutrageous disregard\u201d of whistleblower protections.\u00a0\nFrom the outside it looks like Mueller used the FBI to harass someone who had the goods on him. The FBI has refused comment on the reason for the raid. Is this a lame attempt to keep Congressional investigators away from Mueller\u2019s misfeasance on the ground that it\u2019s a matter under investigation? Who knows? In the meantime, I\u2019m chalking this up as a likely further attempt by the Deep State to keep the truth of its wrongdoing from public notice.\u00a0\nMueller\u00a0\nThe Special Counsel keeps rolling with indictments that have nothing to do with the original charge -- certainly because the only collusion with Russia was by Hillary. Each time the anti-Trumpers are certain the President\u2019s end is nigh. This week\u2019s indictment of Cohen is of a piece with that history.\u00a0\nTom Maguire weighs in:\u00a0\nMichael Cohen claims to have chased a Trump Tower-type deal in Moscow until just before the Republican primary in 2016, despite previous testimony that he (and more to the point, Trump) dropped the effort before the Iowa primaries.\u00a0\nPossible explanations:\u00a0\n(a) Cohen is lying. Problematic, since there are (or ought to be) emails and phone records that overlap with his new story (e.g., a phone chat with an aide to Putin's press secretary).\u00a0\n(b) Trump has been lying. Possible!\u00a0\n(c) Fog of deal-making. Folks who have worked on the Big Deals, whether it be a real estate project, a book/movie deal, an elaborate tax scheme, or something else know that deals generally have the potential for a zombie status, where they aren't alive but no one can quite kill them. Why? Because there are generally many constituents, most of whom did not achieve whatever their current status is by taking \"no\" for an answer. Knowing nothing about it, we can be sure that if Trump has been pursuing a property idea for Moscow there are financiers, property owners, builders, prospective tenants, government officials and various middlemen that can see a payday for themselves if a deal happens. In fact, a day later the Times reports that Felix Sater, a grifter in Trump's orbit, had pushed a Moscow deal for years and never stopped. So. Knowing Trump's reputation email exchanges or notable meetings with Trump on giving him an updated elevator pitch while in Trump Tower or mentioned it in one of their many phone calls, well good luck with that -- maybe it didn't happen, maybe it did and Trump brushed it off and promptly forgot.\u00a0\nAs to whether this is evidence of collusion with the Russian government during the election, well, not in itself. For those excited by the possibility that Trump lied, well, wait until they learn about the daily sunrise (and the monthly full moon!).\u00a0\nDoubtless, hoping to keep Manhattan hysterics from requiring hospitalization when their dreams are dashed, the NY Times prepares to let its readers decompress gradually, reporting that the President\u2019s recall of the Russian deal and the documents he provided matches Cohen\u2019s account.\u00a0\nThose of us watching the Mueller escapades and believing his role is to protect himself and the other DOJ, FBI, Obama officials, and intel heads from exposure for their misuse of national security information to target Trump are beginning to despair of their ever being brought to justice. Victor David Hanson is more optimistic.\u00a0\nColumnist and political commentator Victor Davis Hanson said the verdict is \"not out\" for the Obama-era DOJ officials after their use of the infamous Russian dossier. Davis noted 8 to 10 FBI officials have been retired or reassigned or facing indictment. Hanson also warned Wednesday night it's \"not over\" former FBI director James Comey, former CIA director John Brennan, and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper because the dossier, put together by a foreign national, was used to open investigations and get FISA warrants. \"It's not over because we are looking at a situation where a presidential candidate hired a foreign national to find dirt on her opponent in that dossier was seeded among top officials of the Obama administration.\u201d\u00a0\nSurely, there are plenty of signs that the Mueller camp has grown desperate. Adam Hill provides a fine synopsis of the many Mueller flops: How could he not be desperate? The collusion was always on the other side of the aisle. Hill details all the fizzles of the hot (leaked) scoops of the Mueller team\u2019s hotshot work and concludes, as I do, the enterprise was doomed by fact from the outset.\u00a0\nAfter two years of this Trump/Russia hoax, the truth-bending bombshells still find their way into headlines. Keep in mind that Special Counsel Robert Mueller likely has every text, email, and voicemail that anyone connected with the Trump campaign ever made or recorded, and probably recordings of several of the phone calls. These latest leaks demonstrate that the Mueller team isn\u2019t above spinning their cast-offs as smoking guns for the eager media.\u00a0\nMuch ink has been spilled trying to determine how the Russia-collusion investigation got started. There\u2019s simply no mystery here. As I\u2019ve repeatedly documented, Clinton hired Fusion GPS to push the Trump-Russia hoax as a way to counterweight her email legal troubles. Fusion GPS paid money to journalists and the wife of a senior Department of Justice official (Bruce Ohr\u2019s wife, Nellie Ohr) to help.\u00a0\nFusion also hired Christopher Steele to help. He was already working with the FBI and is documented to have been its paid informant as early as February 2016. Fusion GPS continues to receive millions of dollars to continue \u201cresearching\u201d the story. We never have learned which journalists received payoffs from Fusion GPS (although it\u2019s unclear why any money would be needed to sic the media on Trump). Because The Guardian\u2019s source is secret, we can\u2019t rule out that it is also related to or paid by Fusion GPS in some way.\u00a0\nConrad Black details the anti-Trump hysteria, fake news, media opinion manipulations, and the Mueller fiasco, agreeing with my view that Mueller is displaying desperation.\u00a0\nAnd the Mueller special-counsel rumbles toward its third year. So desperate have Mueller\u2019s efforts and those of his rabidly Democratic staff members become that in trying to extort and suborn inculpatory perjury about the president, they are facing a revolt from the victims, led by Paul Manafort from his solitary confinement cell, but emulated now by Jerome Corsi. Rather than cooperate (i.e., lie) after being catechized by Mueller, to avoid facing the extremes of the American kangaroo courts, they are refusing Mueller, and effectively betting on the failure of Mueller to make good on his mission to take down or seriously discommode the president. Mueller is escalating the terror campaign against Manafort by inciting state prosecutions, insusceptible to the president\u2019s power of pardon. The Democrats have been shouting from the housetops about protecting Mueller, but Trump has no interest in shutting him down. Mueller has nothing, and his terrors don\u2019t impress its victims. What is inexplicable is the president\u2019s delay in naming an attorney general. He must have been considering this question since it became clear that Jeff Sessions was a prosecutorial eunuch 18 months ago. The only reason that comes to mind for his waiting is because he wants to see if the Democrats are going to be stupid enough to try to impeach him, which would not only fail and backfire, it would be a gold-edged invitation to send the Clinton campaign and Obama Justice Department in droves to the grand jury, and on from there on the conveyer-belt of American criminal justice to the fate they deserve.\u00a0\nI hope the president names his next attorney general soon, too, but even more, I hope we won\u2019t have to wait much longer for the FISA investigation documents to be declassified and released.

Look, after 814 (made up number) days of the Mueller 'investigation' Mueller is still chasing down perjury charges against low level figures.  Even if you agreed that this was anything other than a political witch hunt  (which its not) - you'd have to conceded that he is nowhere close to collusion by the president.  So ... if you think this Mueller is a dedicated, honest investigator seeking who will tenaciously fight to investigate the president - he's nowhere near.  On the other hand  - he also knows that whatever report he writes will get a more favorable reception by the democrat House.  So which do you think is more likely - that he writes the report - and hands it to the republican congress - where it gets dished - or that he hands the report to the democrat congress - where his work will be lauded and praised.  So much for the 'finished' line.  Which  leaves resigning and firing.    Mueller took this job as a political hit piece.   He's not quitting.  If the DOJ were cutting funding, all Mueller would have to do is go to the press and say - they're cutting funding.  Political disaster.  Point is- Mueller isn't complaining; he's going to complain before he gets squeezed out.   No complaining?  Then he's not getting squeezed out.  Firing.  If Trump were going to fire him, he'd have done so early.   Then when session resigned and whittaker took over - also inflection points - and I bumped the chances up because people do make mistakes.  But Trump has resisted the urge repeatedly to fire Mueller.  I don't like to sound elitist - but many of y'all don't understand the first thing about politics.  (with that said, watch me be proved wrong on this = )).  Words are not gospel.  They aren't the truth.  They are a tool for getting what you want that are low cost.  Trump could say all day.  Mueller is a bum.  This investigation is a sham.  He needs to realize how horrible a person he is.  Of course I can fire him.  Mueller should have the integrity to resign.    What does it all mean? Not a damn thing.   It indicates nothing, except that Trump is trying to accomplish something with words.    Take a look at Stalin during the Yalta conference; words cost nothing and sometimes score policy wins.   Contrast that with his actual actions.  Final comment.  A lot of political theater going on about a bill to protect the mueller investigation- as if it actually meant something. \nDo you not understand the political process?    Upon passing the Bill it would have to be taken up by the House - republicans there have zero interest in taking up that bill.   Yet even if they did, even if they passed it - it would go to the President.   Now, Congress's session ends in mid-december.   Which means if they get the bill to him after Dec 10 or so - all he has to do is sit on it. \nCongress won't be in session - its  a pocket veto.  Can't be over ridden.   But even if, by some miracle they get a bill to him by say Dec 5.  He could still just veto it.  Do you think they will get 2/3 vote in the house?  Of course not.   Here's the point:  This bill is not meant to succeed.  Its kabuki theatre. Once you understand that this bill is theater, you are a long way into understanding that this entire investigation is theater meant to hobble a Republican president.  Oh sure, if they got like a blind squirrel and got lucky, so much the better.  So this is what I meant on the very first day of this question, when I said this is a political inquisition.  It lasts as long as it serves a political purpose.   There is ZERO chance that this ends by finish, resignation.    And Trump has resisted the impulse to fire.  The only remaining chance is death. When I looked at this question the only thought in my mind was:  What direction are the political currents running.  Will the investigation stop being useful **** in the specified time frame****.  No?  Then the chance is zero.  Notice:  I didn't care about crime (there isn't one, at least not the one alluded to). \nI didn't care about results.

It seems to me that government offices in Washington and media offices in New York and DC will be pretty sparsely staffed for about ten days at the end of December, so Trump may be able to manage the reaction to some extent. He would then have to deal with a Congressional investigation in 2019, but he might feel that he has a better chance of surviving that if Mueller and the House aren't double-teaming him.

On Thursday, Neal Katyal and George Conway argued in The New York Times that Whitaker\u2019s elevation ran afoul of the Constitution\u2019s Appointments Clause, which requires that the president appoint \u201cprincipal officers\u201d of the United States, such as the Attorney General, only with the \u201cadvice and consent\u201d of the Senate.  John Yoo, a conservative legal scholar who served at DOJ under the Bush Administration, told Axios he agreed, and that the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, which purports to authorize the appointment of unconfirmed interim officers to fill vacancies, was unconstitutional as applied to such \u201cprincipal\u201d offices.  Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas expressed a similar view in an opinion just last year.  On the other side, we have Steve Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas, who notes that the Supreme Court blessed temporary appointments without confirmation back in 1898, in United States v. Eaton.   I\u2019m not sufficiently steeped in the history or jurisprudence of the appointments clause to have a strong view either way on the legality of Whitaker\u2019s elevation, but it does at least seem to run contrary to the spirit and intention of the Appointments Clause as articulated by Alexander Hamilton in Federalist 76, which gives the following rationale for requiring Senate confirmation for the highest posts in the executive branch: To what purpose then require the co-operation of the Senate? I answer, that the necessity of their concurrence would have a powerful, though, in general, a silent operation. It would be an excellent check upon a spirit of favoritism in the President, and would tend greatly to prevent the appointment of unfit characters from State prejudice, from family connection, from personal attachment, or from a view to popularity. In addition to this, it would be an efficacious source of stability in the administration. It will readily be comprehended, that a man who had himself the sole disposition of offices, would be governed much more by his private inclinations and interests, than when he was bound to submit the propriety of his choice to the discussion and determination of a different and independent body, and that body an entire branch of the legislature. The possibility of rejection would be a strong motive to care in proposing. The danger to his own reputation, and, in the case of an elective magistrate, to his political existence, from betraying a spirit of favoritism, or an unbecoming pursuit of popularity, to the observation of a body whose opinion would have great weight in forming that of the public, could not fail to operate as a barrier to the one and to the other. He would be both ashamed and afraid to bring forward, for the most distinguished or lucrative stations, candidates who had no other merit than that of coming from the same State to which he particularly belonged, or of being in some way or other personally allied to him, or of possessing the necessary insignificance and pliancy to render them the obsequious instruments of his pleasure.   The elevation of Whitaker to the role of acting attorney general seems as precise an instance as one could imagine of the scenario the Framers hoped to deter.  It is, after all, no secret why President Trump has been dissatisfied with Sessions: He has frequently made clear that he was infuriated by Sessions\u2019 recusal (quite clearly required by DOJ rules) from overseeing the investigation into Russian election tampering\u2014which has already seen legal penalties imposed on several of the president\u2019s allies\u2014and his insufficient enthusiasm for pursuing the president\u2019s political adversaries.  Whitaker, formerly Sessions\u2019 chief of staff, seems certain to be more accommodating.  He took that job only a year ago, after making a successful play to get noticed by the administration via editorials and television appearances in which he attacked Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, and asserted that he would have indicted Hillary Clinton over her private e-mail server, despite the consensus of DOJ attorneys that there was no sound basis for prosecution. Though he did serve a stint as U.S. Attorney during the George W. Bush administration, Whitaker had spent recent years running a nonprofit that produced partisan attack ads targeting Democrats.  Charitably put, his resume is a bit thin for the nation\u2019s top law enforcement job, even in an \u201cacting\u201d capacity: His chief qualification for the post is being \u201cpersonally allied\u201d to Trump.  He might, under present circumstances, nevertheless muster the votes for confirmation in the Senate, but the confirmation process itself would doubtless be fraught, providing an opportunity for pointed questions about whether he\u2019d signaled to the White House his eagerness to shut down investigations like Mueller, or pursue prosecutions of the president\u2019s foes.  It seems quite plausible, in other words, that the Appointments Clause would have functioned as intended to deter the nomination of someone like Whitaker to head the Justice Department if he had to go through confirmation. In the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, the White House has seemingly found a mechanism for, in effect, hacking the Appointments Clause:  Get a loyalist hired in a subordinate role to a Senate-confirmed \u201cprincipal officer,\u201d create a vacancy by forcing that officer to resign, and then promote the loyalist to the top job, circumventing the Senate for at least seven months.  Moreover, the seven-month clock is extended for the period during which the nomination of a permanent replacement is pending, and restarts if that nomination fails to win the Senate\u2019s consent.  In theory, at least, that means Whitaker\u2019s \u201ctemporary\u201d leadership of DOJ could last for the remainder of Trump\u2019s term, provided the Senate finds Trump\u2019s nominees to replace him even less acceptable.  Given that Trump has been open about his desire to replace Sessions with a more \u201cloyal\u201d attorney general for more than a year, it\u2019s even conceivable that the White House anticipated his eventual elevation back when he first joined the Justice Department.   It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess whether, in light of Eaton, the courts will balk at this circumvention of the Senate\u2019s role in providing \u201cadvice and consent,\u201d but if they don\u2019t, the White House has drawn a convenient roadmap for circumventing a constitutional safeguard that seems ripe for further exploitation.  https://www.cato.org/blog/hacking-appointments-clause"], [2965, "2018-11-18T15:33:49Z", [0.0], ""], [34527, "2018-11-18T05:20:35Z", [0.0], ""], [38, "2018-11-18T03:01:55Z", [0.5], "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/16/politics/donald-trump-robert-mueller/index.html The 1 thing that drives Donald Trump totally crazy about the Mueller investigation\nAnalysis by Chris Cillizza, CNN Editor-at-large\nUpdated 4:31 PM ET, Fri November 16, 2018 \"(CNN)President Donald Trump is a man used to totally controlling his universe.\n. . . \nThe whole aura of Trump is based on the idea that he does what he wants, when he wants. If he wants you fired, you get fired.\nAll of which brings me to the ongoing investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into Russia interference in the 2016 presidential campaign and the possibility of collusion between the Russians and members of the Trump campaign. And Trump's clear frustration -- and nervousness(?) -- about it.\nAsked about the investigation on Friday, Trump said from the Oval Office: \"I'm not agitated. It's a hoax. The whole thing is a hoax. There was no collusion.\"\nBut here's what Trump tweeted on Thursday:\n\"The inner workings of the Mueller investigation are a total mess. They have found no collusion and have gone absolutely nuts. They are screaming and shouting at people, horribly threatening them to come up with the answers they want. They are a disgrace to our Nation and don't care how many lives the ruin. These are Angry People, including the highly conflicted Bob Mueller, who worked for Obama for 8 years. They won't even look at all of the bad acts and crimes on the other side. A TOTAL WITCH HUNT LIKE NO OTHER IN AMERICAN HISTORY!\"\n. . .  \nThe broader context here speaks to Trump's ever-mounting frustration with his inability to control the Mueller probe. We know -- thanks to CNN reporting -- that Trump spent several hours this week huddled with his attorneys going over written answers to questions that the Mueller team had submitted to the White House regarding the 2016 campaign. That Trump's tweet on Mueller came after that intense period of question-answering provides our clearest evidence yet that Trump's anger and impatience is bubbling over. But it's far from the only sign. The biggest indicator of Trump desperately trying to seize control of the uncontrollable came last Wednesday when Trump finally fired his long-maligned Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Trump had never forgiven Sessions for recusing himself from the FBI investigation into Russian interference; in Trump's mind, that decision by Sessions led to the formation of the special counsel and all of the problems Mueller's investigation has caused within Trump's administration. The firing of Sessions, however, was not the big news -- that was Trump's decision to bypass Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who was overseeing the Mueller investigation, and instead name Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general. Suddenly, a public critic of the Mueller probe almost since its inception was in charge of its operations. (That Whitaker, who has not been confirmed by the Senate, is now in charge of people like Rosenstein, who does have Senate confirmation, is a also a potential legal hurdle.) And not only that, but Whitaker was selected over Rosenstein, who had been publicly supportive of Mueller and the probe generally. Trump himself has also grown more and more boastful about what he could do to Mueller and the probe -- if he so chose. \"I could fire everybody right now, but I don't want to stop it because politically I don't like stopping it,\" Trump said last week in the wake of the 2018 midterm elections (more on that in a minute). \"It's a disgrace. It should never have been started, because there is no crime.\" That's not technically accurate. The only person who could fire Mueller is the attorney general. So Trump could tell Whitaker to fire Mueller and, in theory, Whitaker could do that. (Whitaker has given no public indication whether he would be willing to follow that order from Trump.) There are legal and political issues that would naturally flow from such a move -- among them the question of whether Mueller can be fired without obvious cause and how Republicans (and Democrats) in Congress would react to the special counsel's investigation being ended. Trump knows all of this. Which is what leads to his frustration. He's boxed in. He can't do what he wants to do. (Remember that Trump already tried to remove Mueller but was thwarted when then-White House counsel Donald McGahn refused to carry out the order.) He has no operational control over this situation. When asked Friday about his latest tweets about Mueller, Trump said tellingly: \"I like to take everything personally, because you do better that way.\" Trump, when cornered, is at his most dangerous -- to his political opponents and, candidly, to himself. He lashes out. He veers even further from established truth and facts. In short: The longer the Mueller probe continues, the more likely Trump is to say or do something with potentially cataclysmic impact on his administration (and the investigation). All outward signs indicate he's getting closer and closer to that sort of point of no return.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  I'm keeping in mind that CNN is recognized as not being sympathetic to DJT and that this is an op ed piece.

The sooner the better. Let\u2019s get it resolved.\" The White House is working to find a broadly acceptable pick for the job. The president's legal team has reached out to former Attorney General Bill Barr to gauge his interest in the position, according to sources familiar with the conversations. Barr, a veteran of the George H.W. Bush administration, didn't say no, but he did tell the president's lawyers he'd prefer they look at other options. The challenge with more traditional choices like Barr and Filip, with whom the president does not have a personal relationship, will be persuading Trump that he can trust them, the president's allies say. They are aware they will have to call on people like the Federalist Society\u2018s Leonard Leo to vouch for their personal loyalty and sterling credentials. Trump insisted this week that people are clamoring to be chosen for the post, despite the difficult balancing act it will take between aiding Trump and overseeing the Mueller investigation. \"I have been called by so many people wanting that job. We have some great people. In the meantime, I think Matt\u2019s going to do a fantastic job,\u201d Trump told the Daily Caller on Wednesday. \u2018Preparing for the worst\u2019: Mueller anxiety pervades Trump world\nBy DARREN SAMUELSOHN\nNo matter whom Trump picks, the attorney general nominee is unlikely to be confirmed until next year. But the nominee could quickly pledge to protect Mueller if confirmed, and keep most Senate Republicans in line and away from pushing the special-counsel protection bill on the Senate floor. \u201cWhether it happens now or next year in the Senate, we\u2019re pretty well positioned to move forward. We\u2019ll have the votes we think, assuming it\u2019s somebody who\u2019s well qualified, and I expect them to be,\u201d said Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), who will take over as majority whip next year. \u201cSooner rather than later,\u201d added Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a close Trump ally. \u201cIf the investigation is still ongoing, yeah, they need to protect him.\u201d However, any pledge to protect Mueller from a nominee or a confirmed attorney general would set off Trump and be viewed as a betrayal akin to former Attorney General Jeff Sessions' recusal. What is more likely, Trump allies say, is silence. That's what Whitaker has given, avoiding a statement that would enrage the president and an attack on Mueller that would alienate Republicans already suspicious of him. The next attorney general is likely to operate the same way, leaving both the president and senators unsatisfied. Absent a pledge from Sessions\u2019 successor to lay off Mueller, any nominee would be enormously difficult to confirm and would quickly turn off the prospect of Democratic support. \u201cIf I had someone coming in that I thought would pull the plug on Mueller, it would be a problem,\u201d said Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, a moderate Democrat who opposed Sessions. Both he and Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said legislation to shield the special counsel from a Trump firing must be passed regardless, given the uncertainty in the Justice Department\u2019s leadership. Whitaker \u201cmay resign tomorrow and we may get a new attorney general,\u201d Durbin said. \u201cBetter for us to have the Mueller protection in place regardless of who the attorney general is.\" For the next month a half, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) must deal with Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and his vow to vote against judicial nominees absent an opportunity to vote on the special counsel bill. But Flake is alone in his stand at the moment among Republicans, and he could remain there if Trump moves on an attorney general. Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said they won\u2019t join Flake but believe he should get a vote on the special counsel bill. Corker, however, said it \u201ccould\u201d help if Trump acts quickly on an attorney general nominee and suggested that Flake may end up getting a nonbinding \u201csense of the Senate\u201d vote.\n. . . \nEarlier Thursday, Trump lashed out at Mueller on Twitter, calling the investigation a \u201ctotal mess\u201d and accusing the special counsel of protecting Democrats. . . .  top Democrats and Flake are floating demands that any bill passed to prevent a government shutdown next month include language shielding Mueller, something Republicans have resisted. \u201cThe final goal is to put it as part of the spending bill and get it signed into law, but the first goal has to be having a vote on the floor. If there\u2019s support for it then there will be more pressure,\u201d Flake said in an interview. The proposal still has scant support among Republicans, however, which means that a new attorney general is the Senate\u2019s best bet to get some assurances on Mueller. And while the overwhelming majority of senators interviewed for this story want it done quickly, Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) seemed fine with a more languid pace. \u201cI want to see the president take his time and find somebody that he\u2019s comfortable with and will serve the American people well,\u201d said the Louisianan. \"However long that takes is however long it takes.\u201d\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  DJT and the GOP members of the senate appear to be working at cross purposes.

The monkey seems to drop the wrench. The issue was that Matt Whitaker was Sessions' chief of staff. He has been confirmed by the Senate in his prior role of attorney, but the Dems raised the question, trying to usher in Rosenstein (the Deputy Attorney General).  However, in a ceremony at the Supreme Court in honor of the new Justice, the Justices didn't bat an eyelash (except for Justice Ginsburg who fell and broken 3 ribs), calling on the Acting AG to induct Justice Kavanaugh.  The law of Vacancy Act was very clear: the President could appoint anyone working at the Justice Department with high enough pay grade (grade 15 or above) to be acting AG for 210 days until the President nominate someone. And the person will continue to serve as long as the Senate has not confirmed any one yet.  In light of the above, I believe Mueller would have to wrap up his investigation soon.

Nominate someone, and let whittaker resign upon conclusion. Trump, in a sense might be forcing the democrats and Mueller's hand.    Presumably there is no evidence.   By terminating the investigtion now, Trump is essentially daring the democrats to impeach him now - presumably with a lack of evidence.  This would make the outgoing representatives have to make a call.   And I don't think they have the guts.   And this would leave the incoming HOR a problem - do they move to impeach after the outgoing house declined to do so?  Especially since the new senate will have 3 more republicans??

At the end of it all  - there are essentially two possible strategies. \nStarve the investigation and restrict it to \"collusion\"\nTerminate it.  Starving it is politically expedient - you can say .. Hey..the special counsel is still working.

First- there are several reasons why someone could \"cease to be Special Counsel\".  They could resign, be fired, die, sustain a debilitating illness or injury, or conclude the investigation.  Any of these things would result in the person ceasing to be Special Counsel. In the last 70 years there have been seven Special Counsels (excluding Robert Mueller).  Here is a list with the way their appointments ended: Newbold Morris ---       Fired (1952)\nArchibald Cox     ---       Fired (1973)\nLawrence Walsh ---      Concluded Investigation (1993)\nRobert Ray        ---         Concluded investigation (2002)\nKen Star            ---          Resigned (1998)\nRobert Fiske     ---          Fired and replaced with Ken Star (1994)\nPatrick Fitzgerald  ---    Concluded investigation with Scooter Libby conviction (2007) Since none of the previous seven Special Counsels died or were debilitated while serving, the base rate for this occurrence is zero.  Hence, I will not include these reasons for cessation of duty in my calculus.   Of the prior 7 Special Counsels: 3 of them saw the investigation all the way through to the end (42% base rate)\n3 of seven have been fired (42% base rate)\nOne resigned (14% base rate) So as a starting point there is a 56% probability (fired rate plus resignation rate) of a Special Counsel ceasing to be the Special Counsel prior to conclusion of the investigation.   Next is the issue of time.  In the three instances where the Special Counsel saw the investigation all the way through, they stayed for a long time: Lawrence Walsh (Iran Contra)         2,420 days\nRobert Ray (Clinton Whitewater)       877 days\nPatrick Fitzgerald (Valerie Plame)    1,162 days In each of these cases there were times where the political pressure was high and there were at least intimations of removing the Special Counsel.  But they were allowed to complete their work and served for an average of 1,693 days.  Mueller has been the Special Counsel for 539 days (as of November 7, 2018).  This suggests that Mueller's tenure would run for another 1000 plus days, if the Russia investigation is of average complexity.  So the likelihood of the investigation concluding by Jan 1 2019 is very low.  As a result I am giving that outcome and a probability of zero.   That puts the probability of Robert Mueller ceasing to be the Special Prosecutor so far at 56%, plus an adjustment to account for the typical time it seems to take to conduct these investigations.  Since only one of the three investigations that continued through to the end happened in less than 900 days I am applying a 33% probability to this.  The time adjustment brings the probability down to 18% (.56 base rate X .33 time factor). The remaining factors are tricky because they are all political.  There are reasonable arguments about  both the high political cost of firing Mueller, and for the real possibility that the attorney general would fire him.  However, the law governing the Special Counsel has changed since the last time a Special Counsel was fired.  The current statute provides significant protections for the special Counsel, allowing them to be fired only for \"cause\".   Because of the very real political and legal implications of firing, my guess is that it would make more sense to simply marginalize Muller.  This is relatively easy to do by cutting funding to the Office of the Special Counsel, which can be done on a whim by the attorney general.  Likewise, the attorney general can easily limit the scope of the Special Counsel's purview and authority.   As a result of all of this I think it is most likely that Robert Mueller will continue to be the Special Counsel well beyond January 1, 2019. I am currently assigning a 10% probability that Robert Mueller will cease to be the Special Counsel before January 1, 2019."], [705, "2018-11-07T23:45:07Z", [0.2], "The acting AG Matt Whitaker wrote this op-ed arguing that the Mueller investigation has gone too far:\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2017/08/06/opinions/rosenstein-should-curb-mueller-whittaker-opinion/index.html Whitaker also chaired Sam Clovis' campaign for Iowa treasurer.

Observers are speculating on the meaning of this move, as anticipation grows for the investigation\u2019s culmination.\n. . . \nThe most significant aspect of this story may be what it did not contain: questions about obstruction. Mueller is asking about Russian collusion, rather than the driving force behind his appointment after the firing of former FBI Director James Comey. . . . \n. . .  there is ample reason to question whether Mueller ever seriously believed obstruction had the capability of exploding into a criminal charge.\n. . . \n While Trump has shown breathtakingly poor judgment in firing Comey and publicly attacking investigators, that is not obstruction. Moreover, Trump had independent grounds to fire Comey, including many of the reasons cited by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in his scathing criticism of Comey in 2017. . . .  . . . if Mueller were seriously investigating obstruction, Rosenstein should not be sitting at the table. For that matter, neither should Mueller. Mueller interviewed for Comey\u2019s job after he was fired \u2014 making him a witness. Rosenstein has an even more direct and damaging conflict as someone involved in the firing and the controversy that followed. Indeed, Rosenstein recognized that \u201cserious\u201d allegations of a conflict exist but, inappropriately, he left the matter to Mueller: \u201cDirector Mueller ought to review that and make a determination of whether or not he believes it is within the scope of his investigation.\u201d   Rosenstein\u2019s position leads to a rather intriguing explanation for his continuation as Mueller\u2019s superior. What if Mueller agreed that this is not a credible obstruction case? . . . . If there is no obstruction, there is no real conflict for Rosenstein.\n. . . \n Trump\u2019s testimony is far more important on obstruction than collusion; his intent would be vital to making even a marginal obstruction case. However, Mueller is asking nary a word about obstruction in these questions. It certainly is possible that Mueller either wants an interview on obstruction or nothing at all. . . . a subpoena to the president to sit down for an interview. Existing law would favor Mueller in demanding such an interview, but he has not requested it. He has reportedly asked witnesses about obstruction but, if he were serious about an actual charge (either during or after Trump\u2019s presidency), he would demand answers from Trump. Otherwise, obstruction issues would become just part of the narrative in a report. For all the hype, the Mueller investigation has not been particularly surprising. Indeed, any surprises are largely contrived with common plea agreements and charges in federal investigations. As I wrote after Mueller\u2019s appointment, it was more likely that we would see charges of false statements under 18 U.S.C. 1001 as opposed to obstruction or collusion charges. That is almost the full extent of charges brought against former Trump associates; the remaining charges against people such as Paul Manafort are entirely unrelated to the campaign. Mueller has charged a variety of Russians with hacking and interfering with the election, but these filings notably do not implicate Trump and actually exonerate Trump campaign officials who \u201cunwittingly\u201d had contact with these individuals.

Those examinations worked under the guidelines of a post-Watergate law that expired in 1999 that required investigators to submit findings to Congress if they found impeachable offenses, a mandate that led to Starr\u2019s salacious report that upended Clinton\u2019s second term. Mueller\u2019s reporting mandate is much different. He must notify his Justice Department supervisor \u2014 currently Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein \u2014 on his budgeting needs and all \u201csignificant events\u201d made by his office, including indictments, guilty pleas and subpoenas. When Mueller is finished, he must turn in a \u201cconfidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions\u201d \u2014 essentially why he chose to bring charges against some people but not others. His reasoning, according to veterans of such investigations, could be as simple as \u201cthere wasn\u2019t enough evidence\u201d to support a winning court case. Then, it will be up to DOJ leaders to make the politically turbo-charged decision of whether to make Mueller\u2019s report public. Government officials will first get a chance to scrub the special counsel\u2019s findings for classified details, though, involving everything from foreign intelligence sources to information gleaned during grand jury testimony that the law forbids the government from disclosing. They\u2019ll also have to weigh the input from a number of powerful outside forces. The White House, for one, has indicated it might try to butt into the proceedings. Trump personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani said earlier this summer that the White House had reserved the right to block the release of information in Mueller\u2019s final report that might be covered through executive privilege. It\u2019s unclear how salient that legal argument may be, but the president\u2019s attorneys have been saying for months that a White House signoff will be needed because the Justice Department also falls inside the executive branch. Congress is also primed to have a say. While Democratic leaders are hoping a return to power in the upcoming November midterms could grant them subpoena power to pry as much information as possible from the special counsel\u2019s office, Republicans might try to restrict the release of certain details that might embarrass the president. As for the crafting of the report itself, Mueller has significant leeway. He can theoretically be as expansive as he wants. But sources who have worked closely with Mueller during his lengthy career at the Justice Department say his by-the-books, conservative style is likely to win out, suggesting he might lean more toward saying less than more. \u201cIt\u2019s such a unique situation. He knows there are a lot of questions he needs to address for the sake of trying to satisfy a wide variety of interests and expectations,\u201d said Paul McNulty, a former deputy attorney general from the George W. Bush administration who worked closely with Mueller at the Justice Department. Mueller\u2019s report will be landing in the shadow of former FBI Director James Comey\u2019s controversial decision to publicly explain his reasons for not prosecuting then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state. The move was widely panned as a breach of DOJ protocol. \u201cThat\u2019s not Bob Mueller\u2019s approach,\u201d McNulty explained. \u201cI\u2019d be surprised if he did that in written form. I think he\u2019s about, \u2018Where are the facts before us?\u2019\u201d The timing on the Mueller investigation final report \u2014 the special counsel's office declined comment for this report \u2014 remains unclear. While he\u2019s under no deadline to complete his work, several sources tracking the investigation say the special counsel and his team appear eager to wrap up. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s determined to get back to the rest of his life,\u201d said Barrett, the Iran-Contra investigator who is now a law professor at St. John's University. But several factors may still slow things down, including a potential protracted legal showdown over whether to force the president into a sit-down interview and what to do with leads that stem from the ongoing cooperation of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen. Both men pleaded guilty this summer. Longtime Trump confidante Roger Stone has also said he\u2019s prepared for an indictment in the Mueller probe, which would kick-start an entirely new trial process. \u201cWhen your investigation is ongoing, it\u2019s hard to write a final report,\u201d said Michael Zeldin, a former Mueller aide who served as a deputy independent counsel in the investigation into George H.W. Bush administration officials fingered for accessing Clinton\u2019s passport files during the 1992 presidential campaign. Indeed, history offers a mixed bag on what to expect from Mueller\u2019s end game. Several independent counsel investigations have concluded their work without any report at all, including the George W. Bush-era probe into who leaked the identity of CIA operative Valerie Plame Wilson. And the two biggest cases since Watergate have been broken up into bite-sized pieces, with interim reports dribbled out while the wider probes continued. The Iran-Contra investigation published intermittent findings on procedural issues, such as how Congress granting immunity for testimony would impair criminal prosecution. The entire probe, however, lasted more than seven years, with a final report issued in August 1993, long after Reagan was out of the White House. Clinton\u2019s White House dealt with a series of independent counsel investigations, but none as troublesome as the one that started in January 1994 into the first family\u2019s decades-old Whitewater land deals in Arkansas. The probe took multiple twists and expanded to cover several other topics. In 1997, Starr issued a report, affirming Clinton White House deputy counsel Vincent Foster had committed suicide. A year later, he published a report detailing allegations of illegal behavior tied to Clinton\u2019s affair with Lewinsky, which prompted the House to open impeachment proceedings. A final report on Whitewater didn\u2019t arrive until March 2002, more than eight years after the probe started and more than a year after the Democrat\u2019s second term ended. All of that history isn\u2019t lost on Mueller. \u201cHe knows how these Office of Special Counsel investigations can drag on,\u201d said McNulty, now president of Grove City College in western Pennsylvania. \u201cHe\u2019s seen all that over the course of his career. I just know he\u2019s the kind of person who\u2019s decisive and if he thought that there was a way to not drag something out because it could be addressed appropriately, he\u2019d have the determination to do that. He\u2019s also not going to cut some corner just to be done.\u201d Past investigators have also struggled with how to handle the public release of their independent counsel reports. In 2000, a nearly two-year investigation into Clinton Labor Secretary Alexis Herman ended with a one-sentence statement clearing her of influence peddling charges. Independent counsel Ralph Lancaster\u2019s final report was placed under a federal court seal and he opted not to ask for permission to publicize it. \u201cI had decided not to exercise my prosecutorial discretion to indict her and I didn\u2019t see any sense in making it worse,\u201d Lancaster said in a 2005 interview with lawinterview.com. \u201cThe press has never picked up on it. Nobody has asked to see it \u2026 which is fine by me.\u201d Patrick Fitzgerald, the independent counsel in the Plame investigation, was under no obligation to write a report because of the specific guidelines behind his appointment. Testifying before Congress as his probe was ending, Fitzgerald defended the approach by noting that grand jury witnesses expect secrecy when they testify. He also noted that a 2007 public trial involving I. Lewis \u201cScooter\u201d Libby, a former top aide to Vice President Dick Cheney convicted for perjury, had revealed much of the investigation\u2019s details. \u201cI think people learned a fair amount about what we did,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t learn everything. But if you\u2019re talking about a public report, that was not provided for, and I actually believe and I\u2019ve said it before, I think that\u2019s appropriate.\u201d Mary McCord, a Georgetown University law professor and former DOJ official who helped oversee the FBI\u2019s Russian meddling investigation before Mueller\u2019s appointment, cautioned against heightened expectations around the special counsel\u2019s final report. \u201cDon\u2019t overread any of these facts that are in the world to suggest a quick wrap-up and everyone is going to get a chance to read it the next day,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will probably be detailed because this material is detailed, but I don\u2019t know that it will all be made public.\u201d Some of the central players in the Russia saga say they, too, have become resigned to not getting a complete set of answers out of Mueller\u2019s work. \u201cI assume there are going to be lots of details we\u2019ll never learn, and lots of things that will never come to light,\u201d said Robbie Mook, Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign manager. But Mook added that Mueller\u2019s efforts can be deemed a \u201csuccess\u201d if he answers just a few questions. For example, Mook wants to know whether and how the Russian government infiltrated the Trump campaign to influence the election outcome.

The former Trump campaign chairman and his lawyers have visited Mueller's office in Washington at least nine times in the last four weeks, a strong indication that the special counsel is moving at a steady clip. September and October at first glance appear to be quiet periods for the investigation, under the Justice Department's guidelines to avoid public political acts before the midterm elections. But the quiet period has seen a persistent murmur of activity, based on near-daily sightings of Mueller's prosecutors and sources involved in the investigation. In addition to Manafort, Mueller's team has kept interviewing witnesses, gathered a grand jury weekly to meet in Washington on most Fridays, and kicked up other still-secret court action. Plus, the discussions between the President's legal team and the special counsel's office have intensified in recent weeks, including after the special counsel sent questions about possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian government. The President's attorneys are expected to reply to the questions in writing. People around Trump and other witnesses believe more criminal indictments will come from Mueller. Attorneys who have dealt with Mueller's investigators and other officials expect that the special counsel's efforts, now 17 months in the works, will include an active post-election period a much-anticipated report where Mueller will outline what his investigators decided to prosecute and what they declined.\n. . . \nIt's not entirely clear yet what Manafort has shared with prosecutors, and if his interviews check facts that haven't yet come to light outside of the prosecutors' own notes. Among the questions, investigators have asked Manafort about his dealings with Russians, according to one source familiar with the matter.\n. . . \nThe visits amount to what could total dozens of hours of interviews between Mueller's prosecutors and Manafort since he finalized his plea agreement. Manafort agreed to fully cooperate with the Justice Department as it investigates the Trump campaign and the Russian government's actions before the 2016 election.\n. . . \nThe flurry of interviews with Manafort and other cooperating defendants leaves Trump's legal team somewhat in the dark on what Mueller is pursuing. Manafort's lawyers have shared information with the Trump legal team, but according to sources familiar with the case, there is no formal joint defense agreement. Manafort's criminal confessions and separate conviction by a jury dealt with his Ukrainian lobbying work and financial dealings largely before 2016. Yet his cooperation is widely expected to include helping the prosecutors build potential criminal cases about coordination between the Russian government and Trump campaign. Aside from Manafort, three other Trump campaign officials have pleaded guilty to charges. Two of them, campaign deputy Rick Gates and former national security adviser Michael Flynn, also agreed to broadly help Mueller's team with its investigation and have visited the special counsel's office to give interviews since their pleas. Mueller's team has also been speaking with Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney, who has spent hours with Mueller's team since his own guilty plea in August, in which he accused President Donald Trump of directing him to commit a crime. Meanwhile, Trump's team is working up answers to Mueller's questions. Even if the defense team were to sign and deliver their answers soon, Mueller's office may have follow-up questions that drag out their discussions. The legal team, comprised of personal and White House lawyers Jay Sekulow, Marty and Jane Raskin and Emmet Flood, still hasn't reached an agreement on whether the President will be interviewed in person or must respond to questions about possible obstruction of justice related to his firing of FBI Director James Comey. While they're in investigatory limbo, expectations have grown in Washington legal circles that Mueller will issue a report soon after the November election or even before the end of the year. When it's finished, Mueller's report is expected to explain the decisions of the Justice Department to bring or to decline to bring criminal cases during the course of the investigation. Mueller's findings and decisions will be confidential, unless higher-up officials in the Justice Department decide to make the report public. As of now, the Trump legal team operates under the belief that Mueller won't finish his work without bringing indictments that hit closer to the Trump campaign. The next campaign contact in Mueller's crosshairs may be Trump adviser Roger Stone, who's publicly said he expects to be indicted after nine of his friends and aides spoke to Mueller's office or received grand jury subpoenas. In the last two weeks, multiple contacts of Stone have been in touch with the special counsel's office about them providing information, according to CNN's reporting. Special counsel prosecutors have also visited the federal courthouse in downtown Washington almost daily. Once in early September and once in early October, Chief Judge Beryl Howell held hour-long sealed hearings in her courtroom featuring trial and appellate prosecutors from Mueller's office. Both times, the lawyers opposite the Justice Department declined to share with CNN their names, clients names or law firms. Howell oversees court action related to the federal grand jury that Mueller has used to approve indictments in DC. Previously she has ordered two witnesses -- a real estate agent and a lawyer -- to testify against Manafort before the grand jury, and she held Andrew Miller, a Stone associate, in contempt for refusing to comply with a subpoena. The real estate and lawyer orders became public on the eve of Manafort's indictment last October, and Miller's attorneys spoke publicly about his subpoena challenge as it was ongoing. Other times in the courthouse in recent weeks, the Mueller investigators visit the chief judge's chambers and then clerk's office, indicating a flurry of court paperwork.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT: I note:   \"Even if the defense team were to sign and deliver their answers soon, Mueller's office may have follow-up questions that drag out their discussions.

The first step to fire Mueller would be to remove Rosenstein and/or Sessions and install someone else who would want to do that. Rosenstein stays, therefore, Mueller's job is safe for now. Trump calculation: use Mueller as the dummy each time he talks to his base. To his base, Mueller investigation started off as a lie, either to explain Hillary Clinton's defeat (Trump stole the election with aid from Russia), or Mueller investigation is a cover up for Obama administration spying on American citizens. (*1) However, Mueller has not found anything substantial about Trump in connection with Russia. The most damage Mueller could do to Trump would be to file his report right before November. But that would be dicey too: the Kavanaugh affair shows that it only fire up Trump base. Rumor also circulates that Muller has less personnel now than a few months ago. Speculation is that he's ending the investigation phase and is in the report writing phase.

Net effect: raised by 4 % points. Possibilities this would resolve as a 'yes':\n1) Mueller gets fired. I only ascribe 5% to that. Despite Trump's notorious impulsivity, I assume he has a relatively strong self-preservation instinct. A firing would probably incite a number of Republicans in Congress. Moreover, no matter how many times Trump has said the words \"witch hunt\", majorities across party lines don't think Mueller should be fired. [1] Trump has shown to be reactive to public opinion so that makes it unlikely for him to try this. 2) The investigation concludes. First key question: what is the scope of the investigation? As discussed already, there are five main stands [2].  In recent news:\n-two prosecutors recently left [3]. How strong a piece of evidence is this for this question? I don't ascribe much to it. The two lawyers seem to have been working mainly on the \"financial dealings\" part of the investigation, which was always likely to be the first to be concluded. Yes, one could see their departure as evidence that the investigation will be over soon. But an alternative hypothesis is that they left because their part is winding down and they are not meant to work on other parts of the investigation. This last point is quite plausible - Mueller is trying to minimize the chance of leaks, which probably means minimizing the number of people working on individual projects. Granted, the article quotes a lawyer working on the investigation that \"they're winding down\". I don't ascribe much to this either - this is kind of a throwaway quote. In my experience giving comments to the media, I've noticed a high frequency of occasions where journalists are simply looking for a quote that fits the angle of their story and with quotes as obvious as this one, there typically are plenty of people who can say them, so it's pretty easy to get a quote like that. i.e. P(E) is high - suggesting, according to Bayes' rule that we shouldn't put much weight on it. I put more weight on Comey's comment. However, it was rather vague (saying investigation is in \"fourth quarter\") so it's hard to get much meaning out of it). It does however raise the chances somewhat (say, 5-10%) that the investigation concludes before Dec 31. -Trump team is handing over written statements [4] on the *collusion* question. This is a sign of progress. What does it tell us about the timeline ahead? It's hard to tell how much time Trump's lawyers will need to prepare the written statements but the order of magnitude is probably weeks. Mueller has indicated that he would like to follow up - suggesting that another round is possible (perhaps likely). This places the end of this particular exchange between end of Oct and mid November.  Less is known about the obstruction of justice part of the investigation. Are Mueller and Trump's lawyers still negotiating an interview/statements?  Another important question - how does Mueller's probe compare to past investigations? First, a reason to adjust lower from the base rate is that Mueller's scope appears more expansive than many previous investigations (in particular: The Nofziger, Plame, Herman, Pierce, and Cisneros investigations all revolved around single individuals - yes, the last one did expand into a probe into obstruction of justice by the Clintons as well). Perhaps 5-10% down. Second, some forecasters have mentioned Mueller's reputation for efficiency. But what about thoroughness? He doesn't seem like one to cut corners. So I am not sure what the net effect of his personality is. 3) Mueller passes away: assumed ~0% chance.

Almost all Republicans in Congress have supported Trump till now but quite a few are likely to break away in case of a firing.

In this post, I will look at base rates. I've assumed a low base rate in line with comments from other forecasters here but I am re-checking the assumptions now. Speaking of base rates, really interesting work by @Prognosticating-Beek here: https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/779913 thanks for sharing!  I tried to reproduce the work (I think the source for the length of past investigations was [1]) and I also got a similar result (6% base rate of investigations finishing within a timeframe shorter than what would be necessary for the Mueller probe to go on until Jan 1. With regard to this data though, it is important to underscore that most data points are based on special prosecutors under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, which as of 1999 is not longer in force. Interestingly, the replacement took place to a large extent because many though the special prosecutor system gave too much free reign to prosecutors and took too long [1,2,3], As [1] mentions, the current investigation is more constrained than previous ones in history. So I think the base rate calculated using this data is probably an underestimate.  I did the same analysis with alternative data from here [4]. This dataset doesn't fix the problem I mentioned above but it includes a few additional (and shorter) investigations in history. It resulted in a base rate of 34% without any data adjustment and 46% after deleting the two largest data points. For now, I am increasing 6 % points to 20% to account for the limitation in the 538 base rate and the larger base rate calculated above.

Advisor said discussion was \"positive, comfortable, substantive\". Trump said: \"We had a very good talk\" and reiterated this phrase. There is trump history to suggest Trump wears his feelings -- He wouldn't look or sound positive if his meeting with Rosenstein was tetchy or touchy [ i.e \"You are about to be indicted; what day might be good for Robert to interview you, Mr. President?\" A conversation like that is not going to go well, and previous run-ins show Trump would probably have publicly insulted the intelligence and integrity of the SC and AG. He didn't so I'm going with the good news scenario. - There's very little new information being released even by democrats. There's even a dearth of false information (which might be a by-product of success of probe, lol. Maybe they are too scared of ramifications to go there at the moment) - Tempted to stay at 49% or less because no concrete indications that steps have been taken to actually close it, although exit of certain prosecutors might be indication of needing less resources going forward. Instead, I'm using the modal number of 2 years or less (4 investigations at 2 yrs; 2 at one year for a total of 6 out 16). Mean doesn't make sense as back-testing 16 data points isn't conclusive (back-testing anything isn't conclusive). Modal because time and resources are relatively fixed; ie Special counsel, AG, DOJ processes and resources are probably procured operationally in similar ways from investigation to investigation, leading to most, the ones with little reason to proceed and more reason to conclude, to last approximately two years. - Looking for date for Mueller interview of Trump. None set up yet although maybe have been part of what recent talk with Rosenstein discussed. Trump interview would  likely be the last step to \"resolve the obstruction portion of his investigation, which could involve making a determination as to Trump\u2019s future legal exposure.\" Trump might be inclined to interview sooner (before elections) especially if he feels confident nothing will come of it and investigation will be one step further to being closed. https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/06/robert-mueller-donald-trump-midterms-2018\n-https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/08/14/robert-mueller-investigation-trump-russia-midterms-november-66-over-newday-vpx.cnn (CNN said this!)

That means of all the special investigations, the probability this one will be done by Jan 1 is 5%.   Therefore, the real question here, is what are the chances DJT will fire the prosecutor who is investigating him?  He has a track record of firing alot of staff from the WH.  He's combative, impulsive, and known to do self-damaging things.  On the other hand, he has shown more restraint in the last 3-6 months. He has found advisors whom he has actually followed their advice. On the third hand,  the investigation is getting closer to him personally and he may lash out. Or, if guilty, and he has shown guilty behavior, he will have no other option, as dictated by game theory, than to cast the die and fire Mueller.   Then the question becomes, how fast will Mueller close in on him, guilty or not, between now and Jan1 so that he lashes out and fires Mueller?  On one hand Mueller is a smart, savvy government investigator who will not intentionally antagonize powers-that-be.  He also tends to follow rules, and is unlikely to come forward with his findings until after midterms, even if he had them.  On the other hand, he is known for moving fast and deliberate.  At this point, he's ready to depo the prez, who won't play ball.  My bias here is anti-Trump. From what I know of Mueller, he should have a estimated adjustment of the mean at 1/2 to 2/3 of normal. Rerunning the code at 1/2 normal mean puts the base at  32%  add to that the odds of Trump going off on him and firing him or replacing Ros above him who will shut it down by Jan1 is 10% so I'm going to go to 42%  then drop fast after Midterms."], [61050, "2018-09-29T18:01:50Z", [0.75], "- Mueller has been appointed on May 17, 2017\n- # of days between appointment and Jan 1, 2019: 594\n- average length of special counsel investigations since 1974 (excl.

Thus far, Trump has tolerated Mueller, but I think it's only because Republicans have asked him to hold off on terminating him at least until after the mid-term elections. At this point, with Manafort flipping, Mueller is getting too close to Trump and his family. Trump will not tolerate this. Based on people close to him, and based on his impulsive behavior, Trump does not appear to be a strategic thinker, even though he would like us to believe it.

Still, others suspect Mueller has not subpoenaed Trump because he may have become a target of the investigation; Mueller, equipped with a broad mandate to probe any matters that arise from his investigation, has reportedly been looking into the president\u2019s finances. Justice Department guidelines say that federal prosecutors generally should not subpoena targets of investigations, though they can if they give an individual written notice of being a target. \u201cI have believed since Day One that if Mueller thought subpoenaing the president was the right approach, he would have done it six months ago instead of this never-ending negotiation,\u201d said Glenn Kirschner, a former federal prosecutor who worked with Mueller. \u201cHe would have subpoenaed him if he wasn\u2019t a target,\u201d Kirschner said. \u201cMueller has no problem fighting this battle up to the Supreme Court.\u201d\n~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  With the revelations in Woodword's book and the description of the WH given in the anonymous letter to the editor printed in the NYT today, it sound's like anything can happen, any day, in the Trump administration.

Paranoia occurs in many mental disorders, but is most often present in psychotic disorders. Paranoia can become delusions, when irrational thoughts and beliefs become so fixed that nothing (including contrary evidence) can convince a person that what they think or feel is not true. When a person has paranoia or delusions, but no other symptoms (like hearing or seeing things that aren't there), they might have what is called a delusional disorder.  Because only thoughts are impacted, a person with delusional disorder can usually work and function in everyday life, however, their lives may be limited and isolated. What are the Signs of Paranoia?\nSymptoms of paranoia and delusional disorders include intense and irrational mistrust or suspicion, which can bring on sense of fear, anger, and betrayal. Some identifiable beliefs and behaviors of individuals with symptoms of paranoia include mistrust, hypervigilence, difficulty with forgiveness, defensive attitude in response to imagined criticism, preoccupation with hidden motives, fear of being deceived or taken advantage of, inability to relax, or are argumentative. What is a Delusion?\nA delusion is an odd belief that a person firmly insists is true despite evidence that it is not. Cultural beliefs that may seem odd, but are widely accepted do not fit the criteria for being a delusion. Two of the most common types of delusions are delusions of grandeur or persecutory delusions. What is Delusional Disorder?\nDelusional disorder is characterized by irrational or intense belief(s) or suspicion(s) which a person believes to be true. These beliefs may seem outlandish and impossible (bizarre) or fit within the realm of what is possible (non-bizarre). Symptoms must last for 1 month or longer in order for someone to be diagnosed with delusional disorder. Anxiety.org, 01/12/17: The Psychology of Dictators: Power, Fear, and Anxiety: https://www.anxiety.org/psychology-of-dictators-power-fear-anxiety\nNarcissism Is A Consistent Trait\nWith regard to dictators, one particular trait that consistently stands out as relevant is narcissism. Narcissistic individuals have a \"greatly exaggerated sense of their own importance\" and are \"preoccupied with their own achievements and abilities.\" They see themselves as \"very special\" people, deserving of admiration and, consequently, have difficulty empathizing with the feelings and needs of others. When narcissism becomes extreme to the point that it: interferes with daily life\nappears to be unusual as compared to others within a society, or\npermeates multiple areas of an individual's life \u2026\n\u2026 that individual may be diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder, which is defined by a: \"pervasive pattern of grandiosity\"\n\"need for admiration\" and\n\"lack of empathy.\"\nThese individuals are \"preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited success\" and \"power.\" They believe they are unique and can only be associated with others of equally high status. Furthermore, they require excessive admiration to remain happy, possess an extreme sense of entitlement, exploit others, and are often envious of others. Vindictiveness Is Common\nDescriptions of narcissistic personality disorder seem reminiscent of what we know of dictators. Not only do dictators commonly show a \"pervasive pattern of grandiosity,\" they also tend to behave with a vindictiveness often observed in narcissistic personality disorder. For instance, in now famous psychological experiments, researchers found that highly narcissistic individuals were more likely to try to punish those individuals who negatively evaluated their work, even when the narcissistic person believed they were administering painful electric shocks. More recent work shows that, after a negative evaluation, narcissistic people will demonstrate greater aggression even to individuals unrelated to the feedback. Such experiments can help us understand the aggressive behavior of dictators, who are known to lash out against negative evaluations. Surprisingly, narcissism could also help explain the anxious behavior displayed by dictators. Researchers have identified two forms of narcissism: grandiose narcissism and vulnerable narcissism. Though grandiose narcissism is associated with all that you might expect from a narcissist (e.g., grandiosity and aggression), vulnerable narcissism is associated with an \"insecure grandiosity,\" which seems to produce intense defensiveness and feelings of inadequacy. Such individuals are often described as being \"worrying, emotional, defensive, anxious, bitter, tense, and complaining\". These components can be so extreme that narcissistic personality disorder can be misdiagnosed as borderline personality disorder, which is associated with high levels of anxiety. The intensity of the emotional experiences produced by narcissism in combination with actual dangers could produce remarkable levels of anxiety, worry, and uncertainty \u2013 to the point that one might actually consider moving their entire capital to the middle of a jungle based on the advice of an astrologer."], [60764, "2018-09-03T04:38:17Z", [0.1], ""], [58853, "2018-09-03T02:59:53Z", [0.95], ""], [20607, "2018-09-03T02:57:58Z", [0.15], "He will prevail.

(1) Will Trump fire Sessions and temporarily replace him before January 1st? If so, will this person fire Mueller before January 1st?  Trump has an impulsive nature, but he has shown uncharacteristic restraint in not firing Sessions, which tells us that he is worried about the implications. Most likely, he fears impeachment, an obstruction of justice charge, or his base turning against him. Today, it is reported that 50% of people support impeachment, which may reinforce his decision (for now) not to fire Sessions.  But if he allows Mueller to keep investigating, it is likely inevitable that Mueller will hang Trump\u2019s dirty laundry for all to see. This will affect Trump both politically and personally. Trump has spent his whole life fighting at any cost, and despite the political consequences, I think that Trump will ultimately attempt to fire Mueller for personal reasons. I predict that he will do it once he knows that Mueller is about to publicize his tax returns, business records, and bank statement (assuming Mueller may do this). Trump\u2019s brand revolves around his personal wealth, and if the public discovers that he is not all that he is cracked up to be (assumption here), his personal life and wealth goes down the tube. So he will likely fire Sessions and have Mueller fired soon thereafter. Reports indicate he will probably do it in November, after the mid-term elections. This makes sense. Trump is itching to do it now because Mueller is getting too close to the Trump Org for comfort (the \u201cred line). It appears that the only reason he is refraining is due to pleading from Republican colleagues to wait until after mid-terms. Still, something is bothering me that makes me think that he will not have Mueller fired before January 1st. I have to figure out what it is. Ugh. (2) Will Mueller wrap up his investigation before January 1st? Mueller is an efficient investigator, but it appears that there is still much to come. Reports indicate that Stone, Kushner, and Trump Jr. may be indicted. If so, we have a long way to go before their trials. Even if he does not indict the aforementioned, there are likely still others that will be indicted.

If Mueller is among the latter, his appointment was invalid because he was neither nominated by the president \u2014 he was\u00a0appointed\u00a0by Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein \u2014 nor confirmed by the Senate. Steven G. Calabresi,\u00a0professorat Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law and\u00a0co-founder\u00a0of the Federalist Society, argues as follows: By \u201clong-standing practice,\u201d Congress and the executive branch give principal-officer status to all \u201cimportant and powerful\u201d officials, even those who have a boss who can fire them. In 1976, the Supreme Court invalidated the law that created the Federal Election Commission to be composed of two members nominated by the president, two by the speaker of the House and two by the president pro tempore of the Senate. The court held that all six must be nominated by the president as principal officers. Mueller, says Calabresi, is much more important and powerful than an FEC member. Congress has stipulated that the 93 U.S. attorneys are principal officers, and Mueller has, Calabresi says, \u201cacted and has behaved like,\u201d and is \u201cmuch more powerful than,\u201d any U.S. attorney. Compare, for example, Mueller\u2019s job with that of the U.S.\u2009attorney for Wyoming.

He is perhaps the only non-family member who knows the inner workings of the Trump Organization. Michael Cohen will be a key figure in understanding Trump\u2019s recent business relationships with several overseas partners suspected of potentially engaging in money laundering, corruption, and sanctions violations. (A federal criminal investigation of Cohen includes more than four million business files that will soon be turned over to investigators and are likely to shed light on the company\u2019s operations during the ten years that Cohen was involved.) But it is only Weisselberg who can recount the essence of the Trump Organization from the beginning of Donald Trump\u2019s involvement: in the nineteen-seventies, when the company first discriminated against African-Americans; in the eighties, when Trump appears to have been in business with the New York mafia; in the nineties, when Trump\u2019s casino was in violation of anti-money-laundering laws; and through the aughts, as Trump developed ties to many Russian and former-Soviet oligarchs and political figures.\nThe Trump Foundation case may have already revealed a potential rift between Weisselberg and the family. His deposition in the case is fascinating reading. Weisselberg makes it quite clear just how sloppy an operation the foundation was, with no meetings and no careful accounting. In a compelling exchange, Weisselberg describes how he flew to Iowa with a checkbook to give money to political allies of Trump, then a Presidential candidate, and he makes it clear that he did this because his boss told him to. It is a damning statement, and the first evidence I have seen that Weisselberg, when cornered, may be willing to shift blame to the President. Judge Scarpulla will continue pushing the Trumps to settle. Trump-watchers, though, will likely hope that the family chooses to fight. We will learn much more if Weisselberg and others take the stand.\""], [12573, "2018-07-08T21:51:28Z", [0.16], "It depends upon whether both houses of Congress are under Republican control.

So I think he's gun shy.  Instead, he's trying to erode the credibility of the DOJ and the focus of his ire appears to have moved from Mueller to Rosenstein.  Firing Mueller would make him look guilty and Trump is all about the optics and the optics wouldn't be good.  But if he can fire Rosenstein and fill the slot with a psychophant, he could control the investigation without firing Mueller.  From Trump's perspective that would be better than firing Mueller.  And that appears to be where Trump is going.  Now if  Trump pulls that off, will Mueller resign? I don't think so. Mueller is an ex-Marine, giving up isn't his style.  Ultimately, I don't think firing either Rosenstein or Mueller is tactically a good move for Trump.  But Trump has a habit of making bad moves.  Finally, there are the fall elections, I don't think Trump wants voters to be thinking about the Trump-Russia investigation in the final months before the election. He'd much rather have them thinking about Hillary. Firing either Rosenstein or Mueller would bring intense attention and further energize the Democratic base.  Republicans don't want an energized Democratic base.  They don't want Democrats voting, because when Democrats vote, Republicans lose.  The fall elections will be tough on Republicans, I don't think Trump wants to make it tougher.  The last thing Trump wants is a Democratic Congress.  So what happens after the election?  If Democrats win Congress, firing Mueller would make impeachment inevitable.  If Republicans hold Congress, Trump may well fire Rosenstein and or Mueller because impeachment would be an impossibility.  Republicans will never impeach Trump even if he shot people on 5th Avenue.  Now, what happens if Mueller indicts Trump and/or his family or reports evidence of collusion to Congress before the election? I think all hell breaks out.  Trump may very well fire both Rosenstein and Mueller at that point because Trump is a very emotional fellow and unable to restrain himself. Trump has never been good at self-discipline. At that point, Democrats get elected and Trump is impeached.  And given Mueller has postponed Flynn's sentencing till September, I think there is a window in August and September where this is a very real possibility.  Between October 1 and the fall election, I doubt Mueller will make any legal filings or reports in order to avoid the possibility of unfairly influencing the election.

A man claiming to be worth billions of dollars -- and who certainly flaunted the lifestyle -- appears to have illegally diverted $7 from a charitable foundation to pay his son\u2019s Boy Scouts registration fee.\nHow does Underwood know campaign personnel were involved in spending decisions?

Its 2,500 agents focus exclusively on financial crime, including tax evasion and money laundering. A former colleague of Mueller\u2019s said he always liked working with IRS\u2019 special agents, especially when he was a U.S. Attorney.\nAnd it goes without saying that the IRS has access to Trump\u2019s tax returns\u2014documents that the president has long resisted releasing to the public.\nPotential financial crimes are a central part of Mueller\u2019s probe. One of his top deputies, Andy Weissmann, formerly helmed the Justice Department\u2019s Enron probe and has extensive experience working with investigative agents from the IRS.\n\u201cFrom the agents, I know everyone has the utmost respect for both Mueller and Weissmann,\u201d said Martin Sheil, a retired IRS Criminal Investigations agent.\nAnd he said Mueller and Weissmann are known admirers of those agents\u2019 work.\n\u201cThey view them with the highest regard,\u201d Sheil said. \u201cIRS special agents are the very best in the business of conducting financial investigations. They will quickly tell you that it took an accountant to nab Al Capone, and it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\u201cThe FBI\u2019s expertise is spread out over so many statutes\u2014and particularly since 9/11, where they really focused on counterintelligence and counterterror\u2014that they simply don\u2019t have the financial investigative expertise that the CI agents have,\u201d Sheil continued. \u201cWhen CI brings a case to a U.S. Attorney, it is done. It\u2019s wrapped up with a ribbon and a bow. It\u2019s just comprehensive.\u201d \"As special counsel, Mueller is subject to the same rules as U.S. Attorneys. That means that if he wants to bring charges against Trump associates related to violations of tax law, he will need approval from the Justice Department\u2019s elite Tax Division.

At the moment, career officials are helming the division.\nOne former Tax Division prosecutor told The Daily Beast that this could cause trouble for Trump.\n\u201cThe fact that there is not a senate-confirmed Assistant Attorney General for the Tax Division, and that the Trump people have disregarded it despite warnings as far back as December that they needed to fill the AAG\u2019s spot\u2026 shows what a self-created mess the Trump administration has found itself in,\u201d said the former prosecutor, who requested anonymity to speak candidly. \u201cThey have no one to keep Mueller and his Brooklyn team honest.

Or does the Washington Post style book prescribe that government investigations be described in religious terms?  Anyway, the tenor of the story is that the Republicans now have some ammunition to use to shut Mueller down. Here's another quote: Eroding public support for Mueller is part of the GOP cause. A Quinnipiac University survey this month found 50 percent of registered voters saying Mueller was conducting a fair investigation, with 35 percent saying he was not. Although the poll showed a positive rating for Mueller, it marked the lowest percentage saying his investigation was fair since Quinnipiac began asking in November, when 60 percent of voters said the investigation was fair. And it showed where the attacks by Trump and his allies have been effective \u2014 with just one-quarter of Republicans saying the inquiry is fair. So \"attacks by Trump and his allies have been effective\" - primarily because the long-suspected anti-Trump animus of the Justice Department and FBI is now on the record. The attacks have been effective because to a large degree Trump's contention that \"they are out to get\" him is true. The fact that the press is downplaying this aspect of the story just lends credibility to Trump's claims. I expect polls in the future will show that the numbers of people who believe the investigation is impartial and those who believe it is biased against Trump will even out. When that happens - when the numbers are something like 45% for Mueller and 45% against, with 10% undecided - I think we can expect Trump to fire Mueller.

His supporters, and the large number of people who are essentially indifferent or at least unconcerned about him, don't really care what he does as long as it isn't particularly egregious, and so far he hasn't done anything most people consider terrible. The only danger to Trump, such as it is, is the introduction of Articles of Impeachment by a new House of Representatives. I am not sold on the idea that the Democrats will carry the House, although they might. But whatever the case, the Republicans will retain control of the Senate, and Trump will be acquitted of any charges by the Senate in the unlikely event that things go that far.  If the Republicans retain control of the House, Mueller might take the position that he will have to continue the investigation and expand it to include Russian interference in the 2018 election.

In this evolved Fraud Triangle, the possibly fraudulent executive stands alone at the center as the great \"I\" and is surrounded by three points: greed, pride and entitlement.\nGreed: Executives want money, position, title, authority, perks, services, etc.\nPride: Executives think they're better, smarter, more skilled or superior.\nEntitled: Executives feel as though they deserve money, position, title, authority, perks, services, etc.\" \"THE GREAT \"I\"\nThe Fraud Triangle still best describes the conditions that can cause most employees to stray. However, the Executive Fraud Triangle delineates additional factors that are unique to highest management. Top selfish executives don't necessarily need opportunities to commit fraud \u2014 they create them. They feel no conviction to rationalize their actions because there isn't anything more important than the great \"I.\" And the only pressure they feel is from inside to obtain more for \"me.\"\nBarriers to fraud, such as conscience, character, faith, fear of detection, internal controls, and processes and procedures, are only that \u2014 barriers and not necessarily deterrents to top executives. Having witnessed much bad behavior and no punishment for it, I believe true fraud prevention comes with real punishment for crimes committed.

Mueller will have to decide whether to go ahead with a historic grand jury subpoena of a sitting U.S. president.\nThe letter outlines 16 topics Mueller's team intends to question Trump about, including the firing of FBI Director James Comey. The letter says that even if Trump did order the termination of an investigation, \"this could not constitute obstruction of justice.\" It contends that Trump has the power to shut down any investigation by the FBI or Justice Department \"at any time and for any reason.\"\n\"Every action that the president took was taken with full constitutional authority pursuant to Article II of the United States Constitution,\" the letter states. \"As such, these actions cannot constitute obstruction, whether viewed separately or even as a totality.\"\nThe lawyers also seem to hold out the possibility of a pardon for former national security adviser Michael Flynn. The letter states the president \"could, if he wished, terminate the inquiry, or even exercise his power to pardon if he so desired.\"\n\"Of course, the president of the United States is not above the law,\" Dowd and Sekulow wrote, \"but just as obvious and equally as true is the fact that the president should not be subjected to strained readings and forced applications of clearly irrelevant statutes.\""], [58836, "2018-06-03T18:33:06Z", [0.8], "The investigation is proceeding apace, and opposition is weak and divided."], [58834, "2018-06-03T18:10:48Z", [0.95], "By then his investigation will impeach Trump.

Here's the link (h/t @MikeGreen): https://www.wired.com/story/if-trump-is-laundering-russian-money-heres-how-it-works/ Here's a quote: \"Many of the activities, when viewed in aggregate, point to a deliberate attempt to create opacity,\u201d says Amit Sharma, who used to work on countering terrorist financing after 9/11 at the Treasury Department. \u201cWhen you take two steps back, you see a murkiness and level of complexity with which the Cohen and Trump companies have operated\u2014what are they hiding? Why are secondary and tertiary entities signing under pseudonyms and \u2018cover' names? Truly legitimate, transparent companies don\u2019t need to do that. Does this point to corruption and/or conspiracy? It certainly looks that way! Are all activities pointing to specific money laundering transactions? Not necessarily.\u201d The fundamental approach to Trump and Cohen\u2019s empires should raise eyebrows\u2014and evidently has with Mueller\u2019s probe and prosecutors in the Southern District of New York\u2014precisely because of the apparently great lengths they undertook to evade basic transparency. While not necessarily illegal\u2014some of the tactics are, in fact, regular parts of complex businesses\u2014the pattern of activity points to an attempt to evade one of the basic precepts of modern banking and anti-money-laundering efforts: Know your customer. End quote. So a former Treasury Department official (and who could possibly be more objective than that?) asks, \"...what are they hiding?\" And goes on to say, \"Does this point to corruption and/or conspiracy? It certainly looks that way!\" And then goes on to say. \" Are all activities pointing to specific money laundering transactions? Not necessarily.\u201d So what are they pointing to? Non-specific money laundering transactions? Money laundering transactions that can't be identified?  Actually, it turns out they're not pointing to anything. Because the activities the article is talking about  are \"... not necessarily illegal\u2014some of the tactics are, in fact, regular parts of complex businesses...\" Well OK, then.  I have no idea how much financial chicanery Donald Trump has engaged in over the course of his career. My guess is that it's a lot, with a lot of unsavory people of all stripes. Whether Trump's a criminal, or a Russian puppet, or something indictable or impeachable is something else again. This is why I think that ultimately the Mueller investigation is going nowhere, and the longer it goes on, the less trouble it will be for Trump to pull the plug on it. Articles like this reinforce the idea that Mueller's investigation is a \"witch hunt.\" What Mueller winds up saying in his report will be what counts, of course, but the constant innuendo from the press may actually sap the power of Mueller's final report, and even if there are serious allegations with solid evidence, Trump will be able to dismiss it as partisan and tainted by biased sources.  There are two opinions in the U.S.: a) Trump's opponents want to get him because he's a criminal and/or a Russian puppet; and b) Trump's opponents say he's a criminal and/or a Russian puppet because they're out to get him.

Perceptions to the contrary derive primarily from the press, which is headquartered in Washington DC and New York City, neither of which qualifies as Trump country. Among ordinary Americans, I would venture to say that no one thinks that Russian collusion or anything like it happened, payments to Stormy Daniels don't matter, and the tax problems of Trump associates like Paul Manafort - while they should be prosecuted if illegal - are no reason to hamstring the administration for an indefinite period of time.

This opinion appears to be binding on the Justice Department's decision-making, though it's possible for Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to choose to override the opinion, give Mueller permission to ignore it and take it to court, or ask the office to reexamine the issue by writing a new opinion.\nThis sort of legal briefing has been done before, like in the year after the 1973 opinion, when then-special prosecutor Leon Jaworski wrote a Watergate-era memo describing why the President should not be above the law.\nOf course, there's another immediate option if a special counsel finds the President did wrong.

I don't believe he\u2019ll fire Meuller because Meuller is serving as Trump's villain as the campaign to discredit the FBI continues. He can't keep blaming Clinton and Obama for everything. I think it's more likely that Meuller finishes the investigation before year end (reasoning below). INTERVIEW or SUBPOENA? Trump either submits to an interview or he doesn't. Meuller already showed he's willing to get written answers to the questions he gave him in advance so that his attorneys can answer them. So, they'll negotiate and provide answers written by Trump\u2019s attorneys.\nSubpoena unlikely - I don't think Meuller\u2019s  investigation hinges on Trump's answers. He is not going to indict a sitting president either. TIMING: Whether Meuller will conclude or be fired by year end? \nManafort\u2019s two trials expected in July and mid-September. Meuller just got a two month extension on Flynn's sentencing which brings it to June 29.\nMeuller may be done by October (not sure) but putting out a report too close to the elections will not be good. He could send Rosenstein the report officially ending the investigation and Rosenstein could decide not to release it publicly because of the sensitive timing.  If Dems win the House, will he fire Meuller? I don\u2019t think so. Trump wants to beat Meuller, not fire him.  Thinking about the ultimate move \u2013 impeachment? Trump can beat a move to impeach because regardless of the House, the Senate is very unlikely to flip. Impeachment may go somewhere or not but Trump will relish beating that too. The end game for Trump will be to boast about it right through to 2020 re-election. If Dems lose the House and he wants to end the investigation, I think it makes more sense for him to wait till 2019 for the new Republican dominated House and Senate to vote to officially end the investigation.  So, if I were Meuller, I would conclude the investigation before the elections or by the end of the year to get it done and stop the drama Trump relishes. Rosenstein has discretion on the timing and substance of making reports public. It has been speculated that Meuller will issue several reports, not just one. \n"], [1333, "2018-05-05T14:50:49Z", [0.15], ""], [1639, "2018-05-05T14:22:37Z", [0.5], ""], [691, "2018-05-05T12:31:55Z", [0.28], ""], [43311, "2018-05-05T11:55:51Z", [1.0], "\ud83e\udd10"], [38, "2018-05-05T04:45:01Z", [0.66], "The more I think about this, the more forces there seem to be arrayed against him still being the Special Counsel on 1/1.

Every part of this investigation gets more out of his control if the House is controlled by Democrats. clare.malone: Yeah, Nate, what\u2019s Trump\u2019s incentive to slow-walk? Just delay even a bad outcome till later? micah: Doesn\u2019t he want it over now? natesilver: Well, maybe not Trump. But Mueller and Congressional Democrats and Congressional Republicans all probably do. perry: If the Democrats win the House, Michael Avenatti (Stormy Daniels\u2019s lawyer) will still be on CNN constantly, but they will be airing his comments via various Democratic-led hearings from the Hill. We\u2019ve been having this \u201cWill he testify?\u201d discussion for months now. Isn\u2019t the actual result of this already known? (He is not testifying.) natesilver: Maybe that\u2019s Trump\u2019s incentive, by the way? Democrats will overplay their hand? If they win the House, for instance, they\u2019d face a potentially difficult decision about whether to begin impeachment proceedings. clare.malone: They\u2019re going to do that. Someone is going to do that. natesilver: Mueller\u2019s investigation could seem like more of a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d if Trump confuses it in the public\u2019s mind with Democratic-led investigations in the House. Some of which will probably go overboard. perry: This is a story from Jan. 8 on whether Trump will speak to Mueller. micah: I guess there\u2019s a difference between not speaking to Mueller and refusing to speak to Mueller \u2014 passive vs. active. Trump is still in the passive category. perry: I actually think, and this is a political issue, that the dynamics of impeachment are shifting. Trump is saying directly that 2018 is about impeachment, which is forcing Nancy Pelosi and Democrats to say even more, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d clare.malone: Yeah, but Perry, I think that idea will be raised by Republicans, sure, but if the Democrats win the House, they\u2019re going to feel a lot of pressure from their base. They might play it down during the midterms, but I think they\u2019ll still do it if they win. Can Trump legally refuse to speak to Mueller, Micah? micah: I think he can, Clare? At least, it\u2019s an open question legally. clare.malone: From Talking Points Memo: \u201d \u2026 constitutional law experts told TPM that if the White House does choose defiance and Mueller responds with a subpoena, it would likely set up a high-stakes legal showdown\u2014one in which the special counsel might have the upper hand.\u201d natesilver: Maybe there\u2019s a sweet spot for Trump where Democrats win the House, but not by much, and they don\u2019t win the Senate. So Trump avoids a massive Democratic wave, which has all sorts of negative implications for him, but Pelosi (or her successor) nonetheless has to wrestle with some of the challenges that come with being in the majority. perry: My understanding is Mueller right now is asking Trump to speak voluntarily. Mueller could get a subpoena, although getting a subpoena for the sitting president is not simple. Then, Trump can invoke the Fifth Amendment (against self-incrimination) and not talk. Or he could make some claim of presidential privilege. There are lots of routes for Trump to not talk to Mueller. micah: If you had to bet, do you think he talks or no? natesilver: I would bet \u201cno.\u201d clare.malone: His legal instinct, historically, is to fight things. Which would fit with the \u201cjust say no\u201d strategy. perry: I would be stunned if he talked to Mueller. Not quite John-McCain-votes-down-the-health-care-bill stunned, but fairly stunned. natesilver: It also seems like we\u2019ve seen a shift in Trumpworld to a strategy of arguing \u201cObstruction doesn\u2019t matter, so long as there\u2019s no (proof of) collusion.\u201d So Trump\u2019s attitude might be \u2014 there\u2019s no point in talking to the guy if he doesn\u2019t have the goods. micah: I guess I just think it\u2019s remarkable that we all think there would be very little cost \u2014 if any \u2014 to Trump not talking. If that\u2019s true, something is deeply broken about something. clare.malone: Such is a highly partisan media environment! micah: \ud83d\ude26 natesilver: I didn\u2019t know the poll numbers were quite so lopsided on that question. So I guess I\u2019d put myself more in the \u201cnot sure\u201d category. perry: Based on the amount we know, it\u2019s hard to imagine Trump somehow exonerating himself in this testimony. I don\u2019t know if it rises to obstruction of justice, but I don\u2019t feel like Trump will be able to say credibly, \u201cNo, in fact, I fired Comey because I have a vision of an FBI that does X and Y, and Comey only did Z.\u201d So I\u2019m not sure Trump has much to gain from testifying, beyond appealing to a public that already opposes him. natesilver: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s one of the three most important questions right now. The three most important questions are (in no particular order): Does Mueller have a \u201csmoking gun\u201d on collusion that hasn\u2019t been made public yet?\nDoes Trump fire/pardon more people?\nHow do the midterms go?\nOne could argue that Trump will be in trouble if any two of these three questions are resolved poorly for him. micah: OK, so to wrap \u2026 Trump knows the answer to #1 presumably; so, when Trump decides whether to testify, can we read into that one way or the other? Same with #2. That is, does whether Trump pardons or fires people tell you anything about a smoking gun? natesilver: There are also a lot of scenarios where Trump is worried about criminal conduct unrelated to colluding with Russia during the campaign. clare.malone: I don\u2019t think Trump believes he colluded. Here\u2019s what I mean: I think Trump genuinely believes he didn\u2019t collude and that this is a witch hunt, which is why he would say he wants to testify and would pardon people he thinks are being unfairly punished. But that doesn\u2019t mean that the campaign didn\u2019t collude. Or that Trump didn\u2019t obstruct justice. But all his actions \u2014 particularly potential pardons \u2014 seem predicated on his belief that he did no wrong.\n~~~~~~~\nThis link is to a graph comparing other special counsel investigations:\nhttps://fivethirtyeight.com/features/mueller-had-another-busy-week/\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  I'm beginning to think that my forecast is too low.

He wants it either because he is wrapping up his investigation and wants the president on the record on a number of points or because he genuinely needs information only Trump can provide to round out his evidence and make responsible judgments about how to proceed. . . .  Issuing a subpoena would require months of litigation if the president resisted it. The fight would likely go all the way to the Supreme Court. Even expedited, it would slow things down\u2014and Mueller does appear to be interested in speed. It is a simply terrible idea for Trump to sit for an interview. . . .  if Trump's lawyers believe that Mueller has nothing serious on Trump personally without an interview but also that the president may lie if he sits for one\u2014and that his greatest criminal exposure involves not what he has already done but the lies he is likely to tell. Normally, in such situations, the subject asserts his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself. . .  while the president has a right to assert the Fifth, he can\u2019t easily do so without serious political damage.  . . . . . . . the risks associated with losing a litigation are dramatically higher for him [the President] than they are for the special counsel. Remember that the law favors Mueller. What\u2019s more, if Mueller issues the subpoena, Trump resists it and the court enforces the subpoena, Trump loses all of his negotiating leverage. Gone is the chance of negotiating a congenial environment for an interview, limiting the time or having his attorneys present. The normal grand jury witness, after all, has to go into the grand jury room alone. Moreover, time may be an annoyance to Mueller, but it could be much worse than that for the president. A responsible lawyer for Trump has to protect him from the possibility of having to walk into the grand jury room alone, say, a week before the midterm elections. Time is not on Mueller\u2019s side, but it\u2019s really not on Trump\u2019s side. In other words, refusing consent for an interview may solve Trump\u2019s . . .  problem in the immediate term but it\u2019s also a roll of the dice in which the downside risk is unacceptably bad and not all that improbable. So the question is: Who blinks first? Does the Trump team decide to negotiate the terms of an interview rather than risk litigation it is likely to lose? Or does Mueller back down and not follow through on the subpoena threat\u2014thus letting Trump off the hook? The key variable here is how much Mueller actually needs the interview. If it\u2019s truly important for the investigation, he is much more likely to take his chances in litigation, accepting delay in exchange for the high chance of getting what he wants. By contrast, if he doesn\u2019t truly need the interview, he might well decide to proceed without it. He\u2019s no worse off, after all, than he would be if Trump asserted the Fifth\u2014which the president might do at the end of a long litigation anyway. To boil it down, here\u2019s what can be said about the possibility of a Trump interview: First, the logic of the situation favors a negotiated outcome. Neither side has an interest in protracted litigation, and both sides have litigation risk. As the probable outcome of any such litigation is a Mueller win, the situation favors negotiated resolution on terms broadly favorable to Mueller. Second, if Mueller really needs the interview, he\u2019s going to get it. The litigation risk for Trump is dramatically higher than the risk for the special counsel\u2019s office. That means that the moment Trump\u2019s team truly believes that the alternative to a voluntary interview is losing in litigation, the Trump team will negotiate terms for an interview\u2014or it will take the political hit of asserting the Fifth. Third, conversely, if Mueller does not really need the interview, he may well blink and let Trump get away with not sitting for one. Indeed, if neither an interview nor a subpoena materializes, that is a sure sign that Mueller is content to proceed without hearing from Trump. That could mean either that his case is weak or that it is strong. It indicates that his ultimate decisions as to how to proceed do not depend on what Trump has to say. Fourth, in any negotiated interview, the more accommodations Mueller is prepared to make to Trump, the less crucial we can assume the interview is to his investigation. If the interview is a make-or-break thing for Mueller, he will hold the line and make sure Trump sits for live questions. If he allows written answers, that\u2019s a sign the stakes are lower for him, for one reason or another. In my judgment, the mere fact that he was willing to telegraph so much subject matter to Trump\u2019s lawyers suggests that he doesn\u2019t really need Trump\u2019s input that much; if the interview were truly high stakes for Mueller, I doubt he would give the Trump team the opportunity to script answers for him. Finally, if a subpoena issues, that is not the endpoint of the game but an escalation of it\u2014a sign that neither side has blinked yet. The essential logic of the situation persists until there is an actual court order changing the negotiating status quo or a negotiated interview to avert the litigation. An accommodation is possible even after litigation has begun.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  Many, including this author, seem to think that Mueller's conversation with Trump will signal the beginning of the completion of the investigation, and that if a subpoena is issued, its likely to result in delaying its completion."], [38, "2018-05-03T21:31:06Z", [0.04], "The Hill reports:  Giuliani set a high bar for a potential interview [between Mueller and DJT] and said a decision is still \u201cseveral weeks away.\u201d An interview between those two would be a clear sign the investigation is nearing its end."], [32258, "2018-05-03T21:03:04Z", [0.35], "Meuller's questions for Trump makes it more clear that his focus is now on POTUS.

The RICO Act focuses specifically on racketeering, and it allows the leaders of a syndicate to be tried for the crimes which they ordered others to do or assisted them in doing, closing a perceived loophole that allowed a person who instructed someone else to, for example, murder, to be exempt from the trial because they did not actually commit the crime personally. \nSource: Wikipedia Affirming forecast. @lsgold7 , @AB747\nFrom a recent post.

Based on what I can find, Mueller will almost certainly not be done this year (see link) because special counsel investigations almost always take many years.  More broadly about the special counsel role itself, the term and position have changed over time but there have been 10 up to and including Watergate and 18 since, not counting Mueller. I make the distinction because the 18 were appointed under a now lapsed independent council law that prohibited the president from firing them. Of the original 10, three were fired before they completed their work so my baseline here is 33% yes. Of those three two were fired after they went after the president directly (Grant and Henderson, Nixon and Cox) while the third was fired after he went comically overboard and started an investigation of the IRS by investigating every senior member of government (Truman and Morris).  Of the other seven one was appointed by congress to investigate the Coolidge administration and he couldn't be fired and the other six were all appointed to investigate scandals in specific departments of the government like the post office or office of the navy.  Of the special counsels that specifically investigated the president, all were actually fired, although typically the investigations didn't stop and someone else came in to finish the job. Based on that I would go to 100% but I want to leave a little wiggle room as these investigations can take years and the president can fire people at any time. https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/mueller-is-moving-quickly-compared-to-past-special-counsel-investigations/"], [57918, "2018-04-18T16:42:01Z", [0.58], "My take is that, although his advisors seem to be able to keep him quiet for a while, there comes a point when that becomes impossible (for example DJT pulling back on the Russia sanctions that Haley had talked about).

If he fires Rosenstein and appoints a more loyalty-driven DAG, I think Mueller stands no chance.

Mueller decides to end his investigation himself; (Yes)\n2. Mueller wants to go on, but is fired before 2019; (Yes)\n3. Mueller wants to go on, and allowed to go on into 2019 (No) Mueller may find himself a mission in life, like Inspector Javert in Les Miserables. It is revealed that Mueller Investigation is not about Russia Collusion. They already knew the so called \"evidences\" are fake, and is only a pretext to spy into Trump's campaign. In fact, \"Russian collusion\" is only invoked after Mrs. Clinton lost her election as a justification of how she lost it. The goal of the investigation, engineered by Mr. Comey after he got fired by Mr. Trump, as evident in Mr. Comey's book, was to dig up dirt on Mr. Trump in sight of the November 2018 Midterm election, and possibly in preparation for 2020 election. So, Mr. Mueller will not end the investigation before November Election (let's say in October, for an October surprise). The goal of the investigation is to keep the \"Hate Trump\" flame burning, and hopefully will keep Republicans to stay home in November and to energize the Democrats in a \"Blue Wave\". Mr. Trump will not fire Mr. Mueller, regardless of what mud is thrown toward him. He is angry, because the whole fight is getting personal. He was warned by Republicans that if he fire Mr. Mueller, he will be impeached for obstruction of justice. He knows that firing Mueller won't make an investigation goes away. He is fighting more than Mueller. Cutting one head of the Hydra, two more will grow. He is counting on his base, and independents, who would vote to keep alive his economic policies (which is working in favor of him at this moment). Making headway in international issues such as North Korea peace talk, etc. would be the best way to counter any internal dissent.  Mueller may be pressured to fold, not by Trump, but by other forces:\n- Democrats win House in Mid-Term and proceed to impeach Trump, forcing the investigation to fold and present \"evidences\";\n- Internal investigation within DOJ and FBI reveals things about by Mr. Mueller, for example his role in some shady deals. Inspector General into these investigations would announce his finding \"soonish\". In the course of this, several actors have fallen: McCabe fired for evidence of lying to investigators and leaking confidential information of an on-going investigation; Perter Strok, and Lisa Paige;\n- Rosenstein could be fired and someone else will be in charge of supervising the investigation. Rosenstein's mission is similar to Mueller: to keep the investigation go on until the end of the year and beyond. But if a different person supervise Mueller, a scope of the investigation maybe narrowed down, forcing Mueller to fold (since he probably doesn't have anything on the primary mission of finding collusion with Russia);\n- Democrats may tell Mueller to fold if he drops some bombs (like the charge of money laundering by Trump organization), and Trump's popularity didn't take a hit (like during the DACA/Shutdown fight).

Trying to guess what a person will do who is demonstrably at least mercurial and perhaps unhinged is never any better than even money.  But let's try: Everybody, and especially The Leader Of The Free World, operates in an institutional framework which to varying degrees constrains their choices.  (I almost said \"matrix,\" instead of \"framework,\" but we all know what movie that leads us into).   Clearly The Leader Of The Free World wants to sack Mueller, and has wanted to since roughly forever.  His institutional framework requires him to sack Rosenstein first, which he also wants and has the official authority to do.  Then he must appoint a replacement who will sack Mueller.   However, he has been warned by most if not all of his institutional-framework advisors that what with one thing and another, doing so is increasingly likely to result in his impeachment by the House of Representatives some time in February.  However, they have also presumably told him that there is just about zero chance of conviction by the Senate, irrespective of how the November elections turn out.  This presumably provides him some comfort. Begin with the amply supported assumption that nothing matters to The Leader Of The Free World except his being able to continue in the belief that he is beloved and brilliant.   (\"Nothing\" includes the welfare of his admirers or the future of the United States. in case you were wondering, and the accuracy of his belief is irrelevant to him, as he assumes all of his beliefs to be accurate.)  Will he accept being impeached if he knows he will not be convicted?  I think probably so.  Most people equate not being convicted with being found innocent, even though it means nothing like that, even in US criminal law.  He will look forward eagerly to crowing about his vindication once the Senate has sprung him and being seen as a martyr or a hero by his ardent followers (who you will recall are also included in the \"nothing\" that he cares about, but that doesn't matter here). There is of course the outside chance that whatever he does will be so (a) outrageous and--more important--(b) so deleterious to the Republican party that he will be convicted in the Senate.  In such a case he will retire to a lifetime of a generous pension which he doesn't need, lifetime Secret Service protection which he also doesn't need but will affirm his personal grandeur, and seven-figure speaking fees whenever he opens his mouth in public, which will be early and often.

Q - What may cause DT to fire Meuller?\nA - If Meuller gets too close to Trump and he feels trapped with no other options. Cohen knows what evidence they took from his office and it has Trump very nervous apparently.\nQ - What will happen if he fires Meuller?\nA - Everyone will think Trump is guilty. Could result in a Constitutional crisis or perhaps trigger impeachment.\nQ - Is it better for DT to keep Meuller in the position even if he's guilty?\nA - Yes, If Meuller charges others close to DT, he can pardon them as long as he doesn't destroy himself by firing Meuller. If DT doesn't get charged, he will emerge stronger going into  the 2020 election. If he does get charged, he can fight it. If he fires Meuller, voters will remember and believe he had much to hide and a cloud will hang over his head.  Timing Question:\nQ- If Meuller has something on DT, when would that likely come out?\n A- Last... after everyone else. \nQ - When is that?\nA- Nobody quite knows but the average special prosecutor investigation takes three years. The longest was the investigation into Bill Clinton's Whitewater real-estate deals. That investigation eventually morphed with the Monica Lewinsky scandal. It went on for 2,978 days.  Q -Does it make sense for Meuller to charge Trump (assuming he has the goods) before the 2018 election? \nA- Not really. The closer one gets to the mid-term election, the worse it would looks for Meuller to charge Trump. It could backfire on him and look like what Comey did to HRC. In addition, it is still early in this investigation and if charges emerge for T, they will be the final ones.  The other major calculation for Trump is whether Republicans lose majorities in November. If they do, then potential charges can easily turn into impeachment. If Reps keep the Senate, I believe they will support Trump and this is likely why Lindsay Graham and other Senators tell him not to fire Meuller.
