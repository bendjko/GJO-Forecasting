Now many of them are on the brink of starvation. Across the northeastern corner of this country, more than 3 million people displaced and isolated by the militants are facing one of the world\u2019s biggest humanitarian disasters. Every day, more children are dying because there isn\u2019t enough food. Curable illnesses are killing others. Even polio has returned. About a million and a half of the victims have fled the Islamist extremists and are living in makeshift camps, bombed-out buildings and host communities, receiving minimal supplies from international organizations. An additional 2 million people, according to the United Nations, are still inaccessible because of the Boko Haram fighters, who control their villages or patrol the surrounding areas. Above: Adama Adam, 15, cries next to the body of her six-month-old daughter, Fana Ali, at their home in Banki, Nigeria, on Sept. 28. Fana was brought to a clinic suffering from malaria and severe acute malnutrition. Doctors decided that she needed treatment at a hospital, but their request for a military escort through the war zone was denied without explanation and Fana died a short time later.\n\u201cWe will see, I think, a famine unlike any we have ever seen anywhere,\u201d unless immediate assistance is provided, said Toby Lanzer, the top U.N. official focused on humanitarian aid for the region. The staggering hunger crisis created by the insurgents has been largely hidden from view, partly because it has been extremely dangerous for aid groups and journalists to visit the area. But institutional failures have exacerbated the situation: For over a year, the United Nations and humanitarian groups dramatically underestimated the size of the disaster, and the Nigerian government refused to acknowledge the huge number of people going hungry in Africa\u2019s second-richest nation. Thousands of people have already died because of the inaction, aid experts say. \u201cIt\u2019s just a complete failure of the system,\u201d said Natalie Roberts, an emergency program manager with Doctors Without Borders, an international aid group. It took over a year for U.N. humanitarian teams to arrive in cities that were \u201cliberated\u201d from the rebels by the Nigerian military in a major offensive starting in early 2015. Until recently, the United Nations had only tiny staffs working in the northeast. The world body had deferred to Nigeria\u2019s woefully unprepared government agencies to provide assistance, not realizing, U.N. officials said, the scale of the disaster\"\n\n US, NATO, Japan, ROK,  should consider  direct food relief from our ag surplus to  these starving souls.  Cannot count on  UN or UNICEF  or UNHCR  to deal with overwhelming crisis in Iraq and Syria and surrounding states. How much would it cost to save a million plus lives from starvation by US Centcom Africa by direct air drop and get USAID workers in  to co:ordinate. I realize our US  military is  not designed for  humanitarian relief operations and is involved in numerous and often competing missions worldwide. The UN  and NGOs  simply cannot deal with  this immiment catastrophe. If not US Africa Centcom and USAID, with France and UK who else?\nWe cannot allow  millions to die as collateral damage to the fight on Boko.\nCan US and its allies save  and feed the world? No.\nWe can, have, and will take concrete steps to aid Nigeria in fighting Boko.\nWe should step up to the plate to deal with the mass starvation resulting from that fight.      \n"], [241, "2016-10-13T15:21:03Z", [0.16], ""], [2965, "2016-10-13T00:37:30Z", [0.96], "I am reaffirming based on @ALM21\nWhether its the military response to Delta Avengers, or the Fulani herdsmen, genocidal violence seems endemic to Nigeria above and apart from Boko Haram.\nIndeed with the focus on Boko the rest of the country seems to be spinning out of control.\n In summary: https://www.stratfor.com/analysis/deconstructing-nigeria corruption  \nEven more important  the historic and geographical  background.\nWhile some are  skeptical of Strafor this is a great summary of the background:\n\"The challenges facing Nigeria date back to its foundation as a state. The country is geographically diverse: Swamps and marshes that dot the southern Niger Delta gradually transition into tropical forests and savannahs farther north, only to give way to the semi-arid climate of the Sahel. But Nigeria's population \u2014 at roughly 175 million people, the largest in Africa \u2014 is even more diverse than its landscape. The country is home to hundreds of ethnic groups, three major cultural groups (Hausa-Fulani, Yoruba and Igbo) and three major religious groups (Christianity, Islam and animism). These factors only begin to describe the many divisions in Nigerian society. The country's countless groups and subgroups, predictably, have made it incredibly difficult to govern as a single entity. Nigeria, in its modern form, first emerged as a British colonial concept following the 1914 merger of Lagos and the Southern and Northern Nigerian protectorates. Before that, the British had ruled the largely Christian south directly, leaving the mostly Muslim north to the region's entrenched political dynasties. After the joining of north and south, the two halves maintained a fair amount of sovereignty \u2014 a setup Nigeria has struggled to overcome since gaining its independence in 1960. Even as the concept of \"One Nigeria\" has gradually taken hold over the decades, the country's vast size and persistent rifts have proved stubborn obstacles to a truly united nation....... The geographic, ethnic and tribal divisions that exist in Nigeria also help to explain the vast economic discrepancies among the country's varied groups. Lagos, located in southwestern Nigeria, is home to the country's \u2014 and the continent's \u2014 busiest ports. The city, benefiting from West Africa's notorious lack of natural harbors and its sizable population, has become Nigeria's primary economic hub. Militancy, crime and a lack of development in Lagos' southeastern neighbor, the Niger Delta, have helped to reinforce the city's comparative prominence even more. All the while, grievances among Niger Delta locals over the exploitation of their region's natural resources have grown. Farther north, agriculture and livestock, rather than oil and ports, are the primary source of wealth. ,,,,,\nthe geographic, ethnic and tribal divisions that exist in Nigeria also help to explain the vast economic discrepancies among the country's varied groups.

This leaves us with 285 additional civilians + the 699 civilians that have been killed in 2016 so far. Summing up to 984, this would mean that the number of the civilians killed by the Fulani will stay below 1.000. However, since the trend seems to continue to rise right now and the number is very close to 1.000, I am staying above 50%. Edit: On a sidenote, the violence inflicted by Boko Haram has been greatly reduced and they got pushed back in the north. In fact, during the first quarter of 2016 the Fulani killed slightly more civilians than Boko Haram (at least in Nigeria). However, as I had the opportunity to join a workshop by the International Crisis Group, they expect that Boko Haram will move further north - while fighters of the Islamic State in Libya may move further South.

The perpetrators of the attacks are identified as nomadic Fulani herder militias engaging in cattle raiding against the settled farming populations of those states. There have also been reports of retaliatory violence and clashes between the Fulani militias and other communal groups (France24, 1 March 2016). The most fatal of these incidents was a series of attacks targeting Agatu communities in Benue, believed to have been carried out by Fulani militias, which killed at least 200 in late February 2016 (Vanguard, 14 February 2016). Last week, attacks attributed to Fulani militias were reported in Enugu, resulting in dozens killed after at least seven villages were attacked (IBT, 26 April 2016).

So their crimes do not weight in, unless they target a new group. In Nigeria, there are nontheless a number of different pathways to mass killings. In my view, they include herder/farmer violence (Fulani), violence between Shiites and the government and various secessionist movements. I am reposting two quick comments and some new data on the Fulani in response to @einsteinjs (https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/172571). 1.) I decided to be a bit more cautious in regard to media reports: At the end of last year I substantially increased my forecast on mass killings in Nigeria, as reports stated that up to 800-1.000 Shiites have been killed in one single massacre by the military. Until now, the death toll remains foggy. There have been pictures of mass graves, digged by the military, but reliable information is rare. More recent articles put the death toll somewhere between 300 and 500. \n- http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/nigerian-military-under-scrutiny-after-shiite-group-clashes-1266287 2.) Also, there are a lot of articles that tend to blow threats inside Nigeria out of proportion, like this one about the Biafran secessionist movement in Nigeria. It states that \"at best, a revitalized Biafran secessionist movement will lead to mass bloodshed. At worst, it will trigger the country's unraveling\" and while it very plausible lays out this possible scenario & its background, it is keeping silent about the actual pathway or likelyhood of that event (the point, that would be of actual interest here). \n- http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/02/08/nigeria-is-coming-apart-at-the-seamsbiafra/?utm_content=buffer21c83&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer 3.) Some data on the Fulani:\n615 people, at least 546 civilians, have been killed by the Fulani in 2015, according to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED). To determine the number of killed civilians, I used their \u201cviolence against civilians\u201d-category, that should fulfil the criteria of the Early Warning Project. Between 1 January and 5 March 2016, according to preliminary ACLED-Data, the Fulani killed further 375 people, amongst them at least 358 civilians. This death toll already encompasses the Fulani attacks in Agatu, that according to ACLED led to 300 (civilian) deaths on February 24. Note that until now they just distributed the number over 5 different events&places (60 each). Summing up, this makes up for 904 civilian deaths in 15 months & five days.  We are looking for the number of civilians deaths within a period of 12 months here. Between February 24 2015 and February 24 2015, the Fulani killed 793 civilians. Thus the number until now does not surpass the 1.000 civilian deaths threshold. How likely is it, that it will surpass the threshold? Of course that depends how the situation on the ground will develop (cheap answer). If you take a look at the graph linked below, visualizing the aforementioned ACLED Data, Fulani-violence is (sadly) no new phenomenon to the region. A massacre on the scale of around 300 deaths however did not occur before.  Interactive graph:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zHPmcEKYljndZQFY2ii_pwFI4XQH0N5SzNci_dSoQcM/edit?usp=sharing\n(Edit: The timeline at the bottom is only roughly accurate; I did not combine the number of deaths reported at the same day but on different occasions; thus some days may get stretched out a bit by google while others where no deaths occured are not represented at all. The number of deaths & the given dates are accurate though.) Assuming that the violence returns to the average \u2018normal\u2019 level of 2015, even the additional 300 deaths of the recent massacre leave us with a max. of around 900 civilian deaths, in my view. However, just a second massacre of that scale would very likely tip the number over the threshold."], [241, "2016-03-13T23:52:31Z", [0.25], ""], [14314, "2016-03-13T23:32:37Z", [0.65], ""], [19260, "2016-03-13T23:09:50Z", [0.85], ""], [1028, "2016-03-13T23:06:26Z", [1.0], ""], [19186, "2016-03-13T22:26:46Z", [0.73], ""], [73, "2016-03-13T22:00:16Z", [0.71], ""], [73, "2016-03-13T21:58:36Z", [0.75], ""], [14045, "2016-03-13T21:13:38Z", [0.87], ""], [14285, "2016-03-13T20:21:56Z", [1.0], ""], [8229, "2016-03-13T20:21:01Z", [0.75], ""], [22200, "2016-03-13T20:20:43Z", [0.75], ""], [22201, "2016-03-13T20:16:35Z", [0.15], ""], [1111, "2016-03-13T20:06:38Z", [0.9], "Given the number of active terrorist group's within NIgeria and the current economic conditions, I believe there will be mass killings prior to 1/1/17. \n"], [368, "2016-03-13T19:24:07Z", [0.15], ""], [60, "2016-03-13T18:45:03Z", [0.71], "Raising from 48 to 71%.

According to a story by Morning Star News (http://morningstarnews.org), while a government official said this week that the herdsmen had begun to leave of their own accord, area residents said the marauding herdsmen and their cattle were still occupying villages in Agatu Local Government Area, and it was unclear when thousands of displaced people would be able to return to their homes. Muslim Fulani herdsmen began attacking Agatu on Feb. 22, 2016, with 300 people killed by Feb. 29, 2016, sources said. The heavily-armed herdsmen reportedly slaughtered at least eight others on Tuesday (March 8) in Benue\u2019s Logo Local Government Area. It was not immediately possible to independently verify the report.\n[...]\nIkwulono John Anthony, an indigene of the affected Christian communities who visited the area shortly after the attacks, told Morning Star News today (Friday, March 11, 2016) that the Fulani herdsmen are still in some areas.\n[...]\n\u201cDisplaced villagers, estimated to be about 7,000, have taken refuge in temporary camps while some of the herdsmen have occupied some of the villages. On Tuesday (March 8, 2016), the same day Benue State Commissioner of Police Paul Yakadi was reported as saying that herdsmen had begun to leave to bring an end to the crisis, Muslim Fulanis reportedly invaded four villages in the Logo LGA, including Tse Chia, Tse Nhumbe, Deghkia and Ngorukgan, and killed at least eight people.\u201d\n~~~~ COMMENT: Correct me if I'm wrong (cc @dkc, @clinton, & @scholarandcat), but I don't think anyone's mentioned this particular instance (i.e. an attack against Christian farmers)?
