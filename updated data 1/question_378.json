Trump uses controversial diversions to try to take attention away from the Russia investigations. He could do that via action on the UNFCCC. Before April 30? That's unclear to me. But, an announcement reportedly will occur this week.

The Congressional Research Service (CRS) found Trump may \u201cunilaterally withdraw\u201d from the so-called Paris agreement \u201cwithout seeking approval from the legislative branch. Then-President Barack Obama signed the agreement in 2016, pledging to cut U.S. emissions 26 to 28 percent.\n. . . \n\"Trump is expected to withdraw from the agreement, but it\u2019s unclear how exactly he would do it. \"CRS laid out three main ways Trump can nullify the Paris agreement: \"1. Wait Two Years.  The Paris agreement does not allow parties to withdraw until three years after it goes into force. CRS notes the \u201cagreement entered into force in November 2016, the right of withdrawal would not be available until November 2019.\u201d  The Obama administration considered the Paris agreement to be an \u201cexecutive agreement\u201d that did not need Senate approval. Trump could unilaterally withdraw from the treaty should he decide to wait. \"2. Repeal Obama-Era Regulations.  Trump doesn\u2019t need to formally withdraw from the Paris agreement, he can just undo Obama\u2019s so-called \u201cClimate Action Plan\u201d \u2014 the key policies Obama crafted to meet his U.N. emissions pledge.  CRS notes that \u201c[b]ecause the emissions targets themselves are not binding under this interpretation, it may be possible to repeal or revise the domestic regulations that the Obama Administration sought to utilize to meet its emission reduction targets in the United States\u2019 NDC without withdrawing from or violating a legal obligation in the Paris Agreement.\u201d  Trump already plans on eliminating the \u201cClimate Action Plan,\u201d and has issued an executive order that federal agencies repeal two regulations for every new one issued. So, until Trump makes a formal decision on Paris, he\u2019ll likely continue down this path. \"3. Burn The Whole House Down.  If Trump doesn\u2019t want to wait until 2019 to formally withdraw . . . .\u201cIf the Executive sought to pursue such a course of action and effectuate such a withdrawal, it would need to provide written notice to the U.N. pursuant to the terms of the UNFCCC,\u201d CRS reported. \u201cWithdrawal from both the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement would become effective one year later.\u201d There\u2019s just one problem. The Senate ratified the UNFCCC in 1992, and there\u2019s limited precedent for how the U.S. actually goes about withdrawing from a congressionally-ratified treaty.  CRS says \u201cit is unclear whether the Executive would be required to receive congressional or senatorial approval should it decide to withdraw from the UNFCCC.\u201d Congress could sue Trump for trying to pull out of the UNFCCC.  Republicans control both chambers of Congress, so pulling out of the UNFCCC may not be completely out of the question.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  \nOption #1 I think would result in a \"No\" resolution to this question because it would fall outside the question's time-frame.\nOption #2 I think that this would also result in a \"No\" resolution as it doesn't involve giving notice of intent to withdraw.\nOption #3 I think this option would resolve this question as \"Yes\", eventually, but since I think it would involve injunctions, lawsuits and appeals, it would take more than the 76 days left before this question closes.  HOWEVER, it's unclear to me how  and when GJO Admins would close and score this question.  Would they close it immediately after notice of intent to withdraw was given?  or would they wait until it was declared legal?

I am revising my estimate downward to approximately 28 percent in line with two recent reductions in legislative oversight of the fossil fuel industies (coal, oil, natural gas) with many more to come.  These included deregulating oversight regulations for preventing coal mining, oil and natural gas dumping and contaminating streams and river, and the repeal of a regulation that would have required energy companies to disclose their payments to foreign governments.  The latter repeals a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rule written under the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law meant to fight corruption in resource-rich countries by mandating that companies on United States stock exchanges disclose the royalties and other payments that oil, natural gas, coal and mineral companies make to governments.  Paradoxically, this trend pretty much negates a need to withdraw from the UN Framework as compliance is voluntary and Trump's actions eliminates the need for him to formally withdraw.  I believe that the current activity rate on other issues, such as moving ahead on infrastructure programs and ongoing immigration issues would tend to relegate abandoning the framework to well beyond the first hundred days.  I would go lower to 20 percent if I were as sure of the President's predictability as I am of the rationale for not withdrawing.
