There are 27 (non-UK) states. Croatia, Romania, Bulgaria are not going to want to leave since they've just worked so hard to join and benefit financially/through trade/migration.\nSimilar arguments for Poland/Slovakia/Slovenia/Latvia/Estonia/Lithuania/Czechia. \nBenelux: very unlikely; started EU Candidates to investigate: \nGermany: Biggest EU contributor to the EU budget.

Brexit has made me aware of the pitfalls of open borders and unlimited immigration.  Not only does there seem to be a maximum threshold in all human organizations for acceptance of \"others\",  before \"natives\" begin to feel threatened and start a backlash, but there has to be resentment on the other side of the fence:  in countries which are experiencing a brain-drain.

There has been growing discussion among certain EU member states such as Italy, Poland, Greece, Hungary, etc about the possibility of leaving. It appears that these discussions largely revolve more nationalistic sentiments in which states wanted autonomy to make their own decisions about what is best for their state politically and economically. A major driving force has been the influx of migrants from the MENA region settling in EU states which has caused a backlash from EU member states wishing to have more control over their territorial borders. However, despite these discussions and sometimes threats to leave, it would not be in the best interest for most if any EU member states to leave at this moment. As we are witnessing with Brexit it has been a divisive and difficult process to disentangle a state from the EU as a large and still maintain a mutually beneficial relationship enjoyed while an EU member state. Leaving the EU for states like Poland or Hungary would not be a major loss for the EU as a whole because they are not a substantial contributer to the EU as a whole, however, they would greatly lose out in the process by foregoing many of the economic and political benefits they have enjoyed as an EU member state.

That being said, the question is asking if a referendum would be scheduled, which does not necessarily mean an outright departure.

While a casual read of international headlines might suggest that Europe is currently in the throes of a populist wave that could see multiple states trying to leave the EU, recent elections and the makeup of populist parties across the continent might suggest a different narrative. Populist parties in populist leaning countries did well in recent elections, but outside of countries already with a populist tilt, EU skeptic parties made little headway.  This trend might suggest that national populist tendencies could better reflect domestic political considerations instead of feelings about the European project.  Turnout this for these elections also reached the 50 percent mark.  This illustrates a greater interest in European politics, and represents a marked increase in turnout compared to previous election year.  Finally, it is hard to measure how EU skeptics weigh Brexit talks in their planning.  It would be hard to imagine that the Brexit process hasn't at least given some skeptics pause about the way ahead.

The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries. It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other.  As things stand, the UK is due to leave the European Union at 23:00 GMT on 31 October 2019.\u00a0 Leaving the UK might present some hurdles- but it does not lead to complete isolation as some in the media imply.  The World Trade Organization sets rules for countries that don't have free trade deals with each other, including tariffs - the taxes charged on the import of goods. Without an agreement on trade, the UK would trade with the EU under World Trade Organization rules. https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887.  There is a debate to which countries are considered the most likely to leave the EU next.  Like Britain in the EU, Denmark has constantly demanded exceptions from EU law.  Czech elections in October were characterized by the rise of the far-right, anti-European Freedom and Direct Democracy party, who won 22 seats, entering parliament for the first time.  After Taoiseach Leo Varadkar threatened to stall Brexit negotiations without guarantees on a hard border, Ireland seems pretty committed to the bloc.  However, as the impacts of Brexit on the EU become clearer, it\u2019s likely Ireland will be one of the hardest-hit countries. If its economy is sunk by Britain leaving the trading bloc, Ireland could be the first country to follow us out of the Union.  In Hungary, Mr. Orb\u00e1n's virulently anti-immigration party is no fan of European freedom of movement and has clashed with the EU leadership more than once.  He is set to win re-election later this year - which could give him the mandate to retreat from Europe.  Unsurprisingly, given its well-documented Euro woes, Greece tops the list of countries likely to be next to quit the EU.  https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/884279/Brexit-EU-European-countries-leave-bloc-follow-Britain-odds-favourites.   Poland\u00a0is arguing with the EU over a controversial reform of its judiciary and in a recent poll, a third of those questioned said they rejected EU membership.\u00a0https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/fundamental/article/special_report/2018/11/16/Which-Countries-Want-to-Leave-the-EU-After-Brexit-Euro-Analysis.html.  All of these predictions received a lot of attention in 2018- but look where Brexit is now.  TIME: Three years ago,\u00a0Greece organized a referendum in just over a week, in which voters rejected the terms of an international bailout following the country's debt crisis- but experts assert that if referendums are organized too hastily, it can give the impression that \"normal procedure is not being followed\" and that voters may see the eventual result as illegitimate. So with respect to a timeframe- it is possible- especially as a new UK Brexit referendum is assessed to take at least 10 weeks to roll out.  So\u2026 is it possible by any country to set a referendum by 01 Jan 2020- YES; however, given that nationalism and isolationist trends have such a bad reputation today- and the UK demonstrated how divisive an EU exit can be- the probability of it happening is low.

The Brexit vote has been messy and the UK is trying to negotiate different deals with he EU to ensure it has access to its markets, trade, and traveling policies. In turn, I believe other countries will be unlikely to set a date to leave the EU or eurozone based on the mess that has evolved from the UK referendum and the UK trying to hold onto benefits that being a part of Eurozone offers.

Formerly Sweden and France could also have been considered risk areas but recent elections have shown a relative turn to normalcy in the internal politics of those countries.

In Hungary most citizens hold a neutral view of the EU, but more prefer the system than disdain it. And in Denmark the public has reacted strongly to the process of Brexit and support for the Union is at a high-water mark.

"], [68145, "2019-03-26T19:05:00Z", [0.04], "Note of caution to myself and others: I\u2019m very new to making thorough predictions, and I do not possess domain-specific knowledge about the EU (other than living in an EU country). Thus I have probably missed crucial information and/or included some irrelevant information. This prediction will be updated as I collect more information. Some conciderations: The base-rate of leaving EU seem to be fairly low, although I haven\u2019t crunched the numbers yet, given that there are currently 28 member states of the EU, of which many of them became members in the 1990\u2019s and mid 2000\u2019s, and only the UK is on the path of exiting EU at the moment. Of course, Brexit might indicate a change in the underlying probability of member states leaving the EU; they might provoke other countries to leave the EU. However, the effect of Brexit on how citizens of EU countries view the EU have been positive it seems (https://www.pewglobal.org/2017/06/15/post-brexit-europeans-more-favorable-toward-eu/), i.e. there seem to have been an increase in the approval ratings for the EU between 2016 and 2017 (whether this is causal is unclear to me). But it is also clear that citizens of Greece look far less favourably on the EU than the UK (https://www.pewglobal.org/2017/06/15/post-brexit-europeans-more-favorable-toward-eu/), and the UK voted to leave. Thus there seem to be some risk that at least Greece would also exit the EU. The data I\u2019m basing this on is roughly two years old, I\u2019m therefore unsure how reliable it is as a predictor of the current sentiment. However, in the graph from the link cited above, Greek citizens seem to have had consistently lower approval of the EU than UK citizens since 2012. The reason not many experts seem to mention the risk of Greece exiting the EU is unclear to me at the moment, I will look into why that is in the future. The probability of exiting the eurozone might be somewhat independent from the probability of exiting the EU, so that states that exit the eurozone do not necessarily exit the EU. Only 19 of the 28 EU member states are part of the eurozone, which means the base rate for leaving the eurozone should probably be lower than for leaving the EU. As of yet, no countries have left the eurozone, and most member states entered it ~ 20 years ago, which should also push the probability downwards. All in all, I think this should increase the probability of the answer to the question being \u201dyes\u201d by maybe 50% compared to only looking at the probability of a referendum on exiting the EU. Clarification: I\u2019ve used the terms \u201dexiting EU\u201d and \u201dexiting the eurozone\u201d instead of \u201dsetting a date for a referendum on exiting\u201d. This is only to make the text readable; I do think the probability of setting a date is allmost by definition more likely than actually exiting, especially within a short time-frame.

But the 5% consensus is crazy overconfident. There are 27 members of the EU. We hear about MAYBE 6 of them on the news regularly. Have people researched what's going on politically in Lithuania, or Malta? I sure haven't. When you say that there's a 95% chance that EVERY member will do X, implicitly you're saying each member has a 0.95^(1/27) ~ 99.8% chance of doing it. In other words, you're saying each EU member has only a 0.2% chance of scheduling a referendum. From a purely base rate standpoint, we don't have the data to make such a confident assertion about even the main, founding EU members such as Germany! The EU started 61 years ago, so after observing Germany not schedule a ref for 61 years, if we start from a no-info prior, by Bayes we should say there's a 1/63 ~ 1.6% chance they schedule it this year. If we adopt that level of confidence for all 27 countries, then we get a  1 - (1 - 0.016)^27 ~ 35% chance that at least one country schedules. One would also do well to remember that being in favor of a referendum is not the same as being in favor of leaving, see [1]: in mid-2017, only 22% of French wanted to leave, but 61% supported referendum. These numbers are 13% and 65% for Spain. Anywya, I don't think 35% is right either. We have info beyond base rates. I just did this calculation to illustrate how much confidence you need in your forecast for each country to justify a 5%/95% level of confidence in the aggregate result. Here are the EU countries, broken up into three groups: (1) No chance of scheduling ref this year:\nAustria, Belgium, Ireland, Luxembourg, Germany, Netherlands, Portugal. (2) There have been at least some rumors of EU exit, and/or I know they are currently kind of unstable or disliking the EU:\nGreece, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Sweden. (3) I don't know anything about them, or signal is noisy (is core member but people favor ref):\nBulgaria, Croatia, Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain. Let's say I give following odds: group 1, 0% chance of scheduling; group 2, each country has 1% chance of scheduling; group 3, 0.5%. Then odds that nobody schedules are (1.0^7)*(0.99^5)*(0.995)^15 ~ 88%. That means ~12% chance that one does. Will decrease by ~1% every month.

But it did not threaten to leave EU for the simple reason that it has more economic gain than loss staying in EU.  Italy is such a mess politically that it is unlikely that it has the consensus to act on exiting EU.   While there are minor rumblings from Eurosceptics in other countries in this group, they and their affiliated parties are not close to having much political power.  There is little chance that an EU-exit referendum will be declared in 2019 in this group.   Most of the countries in the second group used to be in the sphere of interest of the Soviet Union.  They do not have a long tradition of democracy and liberalism.  This leads to disagreements with EU (which is dominated by liberal democratic ideas and policies).  Talks of leaving EU arise as Eurosceptic parties gained power, such as in Hungary and Poland.  However, they have more to gain staying in EU than out.  These countries have received, and continue to receive, lots of funding for their economic development since they joined EU.  They are too small to be able to stand alone economically.   Talking of leaving is fine and useful in gaining leverage.  But they are not stupid enough to leave.  Furthermore, these countries seem to be able to thumb their nose at EU without consequence, such as putting up border fences to stop migrants.

Populist sentiment, lagging economy, high debt, and immigration challenges (either real or perceived). GDP growth in the UK slowed in 2015 before the referendum was declared. Immigration from Syria and North Africa was picking up, and a Populist political party was elected. If I compare those three factors to my understanding of the current situation in Italy, the current situation for all 3 seems worse. Further, a recent study found 44% of Italian feel the EU has not been beneficial for their country. Further, 42% view membership as a \"good thing\" and 18% view it as a \"bad thing\". Now, the alternative argument. The Italian government is watching the challenges the UK is facing. Further, I think they understand the trade benefits EU membership provides. Finally, I would argue that as one of the weaker EU economies, Italy would be the first to fall into a recession (third in the past 15 years). Leaving in a weak economic environment, with a depreciating currency, and little room to cut rates would be detrimental. The budget is technically in alignment with EU rules, I think this is saber-rattling. So let's come to a probability. Economics rarely play in the voting booth and austerity plays less. That would push me towards an increase in probability (by say 20%). However, the recession fears are real and I have to believe Italy doesn't want to go through \"Brexit\" in a negative growth environment (-7 to -10%). Ultimately, the question is whether a referendum will be scheduled - something the ruling party might do for political cover (+3 to +7%).

From the top of my head I know of Poland, Hungary, Italy and Greece which have active conflicts with Brussels. If we end up in the next economic crisis it is likely that at least Spain will also end up breaching budget rules and creating a new conflict. The main point why I think it is (still) unlikely is that the final result of Brexit still won't be in. Either we have a hard Brexit, then it will be an excellent study case on exactly how interconnected Europe is today and exactly how pragmatic governments will end up being in the face of actual crisis. But the long-term relationship won't be finalised at the end of this year and probably be highly in flux. Or we get some kind of deal (somewhere between TM's deal and staying in the EU) in which case we will probably have a somewhat good idea of how the future relationship will look like, but still nothing finalised. I'm uncertain what the extend of \"leave-willingness\" really is in even these EU member states. I have a certain amount of hope that it is mainly posturing in order to get a better negotiating position, rather than a primary leave wish.
