Violent clashes between armed groups and targeted violence against civilians, as well as sexual violence towards women and girls, have taken place in Alindao, Bangassou, Batangafo, Bocaranga, Bria and Zemio. As a result, over half a million people have sought refuge in neighbouring states, and 600,000 have been displaced within the country. Simon Adams, executive director of the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect said: \"Civilians in CAR face the daily threat of predatory armed groups. Now is the time for the international community to reinforce the UN peacekeeping mission and to prevent a return to the mass atrocities and political failures of the past.\"\n- http://www.globalr2p.org/publications/569 Also look @mzapata 's comment below: https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/591715 --------------- I agree with both assessments. While the mission's capacity is clearly too limited in comparision to the scale of the crisis, I for now do believe that large scale atrocities as we saw before will be adverted nontheless. Meaning: The death toll will probably sadly increase further (depending on whether additional peacekeepers will be send there or not), but not surpass 1.000 deliberately killed civilians by one specific actor (e.g. ex-s\u00e9leka or anti-balaka).  So far 507 civilians have been deliberately killed in 2017 (using ACLEDS 'violence against civilians'-category). 35 can be directly attributed to the Anti-Balaka, four to the Ex-S\u00e9leka. The death toll for both group is higher than the ACLED Dataset suggest at first as both groups aren't exactly disciplined and consist of various fractions that are included in the ACLED dataset aswell.  Amongst those, the most agressive actor would be the 'UPC: Union for Peace in the Central African Republic '. Regardless of its iconic name, the Union has killed 207 civilians deliberately so far. The UPC is one of the several S\u00e9leka splinter groups with little or no interest in a political settlement, mainly because it is also a splinter group of the Chadian rebels FPR. It is very unlikely that their attacks will stop completely, even if the number of peacekeepers gets increased substantially, as the huge country is very hard to control. While I don't believe that the treshold will be surpassed, the 0% consensus strikes me as way off (unless it's Liechtenstein.;-) )\nWhile the region in crisis for a long time, nobody that I know of saw the complete collapse of the CAR coming in 2012.
