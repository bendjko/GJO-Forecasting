To hit 380k Tesla would need to have started making ~8.4k Model 3s per week, 2-4 weeks ago. To fail to hit 330k, we'd need to see a big demand shock, breaking the trend (since 2013) that Q4 sales are close to or higher than Q3.

I struggle to get my head around the idea of going from a bare piece of land in December 2018 to a finished 9.3 million sq. ft. 21st century factory in November 2019. The rate of progress is astonishing. However I'm now a believer - I think they could begin Model 3 production in Shanghai this year. Will GF3 produce enough units to get deliveries into the next bucket? I don't think so. If the Fremont factory takes deliveries up to about 352k (assuming similar numbers in Q4 as in Q3) then GF3 would need to deliver 28,000 Model 3's in order to get us into the next bucket. Assuming GF3 came online towards the end of November it would have to produce 28,000 units in 4 weeks, i.e. 7,000 per week which I think is not feasible. Crowd: 5%, 20%, 65%, 6%, 4%.

So far, the numbers look quite favorable for Tesla to achieve that production feat. Tesla has now successfully built more than 85,000 vehicles in a quarter twice. They did it during the fourth quarter of 2018 and then repeated it in the second quarter of 2019. This demonstrates that the production line and the supply chain has everything in place to build more than 6,500 vehicles per week. Even if Tesla finds it hard to ramp to higher levels from here, just holding its current peak production capacity will allow Tesla to build around 170,000 vehicles (26 weeks @ 6,500/week) in the second half of the year, helping them to get very close to the target of 360,000 vehicles for the year.  Tesla can build more than 330,000 vehicles without breaking a sweat, but will need a little more effort to get above 350,000. Now that we've addressed the supply side of the equation, let's analyze the demand side.

All manufacturing equipment in Fremont has demonstrated capability of a 7,000 Model 3 vehicles per week run rate, which we continue to work to increase.\" As you can see, production rate has not gone down like the delivery dip in 2019 Q1. This was due to deliveries beginning in Europe and China [4 - Tesla Q1 shareholder letter]. In addition, Tesla reports that production rates have hit monthly records in May and June. Therefore, I don't expect production/delivery rate to lower in 2019 Q3 and Q4.  According to Bloomberg Tesla Tracker [6], Tesla is targeting 7,000/week production by the end of 2019. Given their current production average of about 6,000/week (estimated from the graph), that averages out to 6,500/week * 26 weeks = 169,000. Subtracting the delivery delay (1,667 * 2 quarters = 3,333): 169,000 - 3,333 = 165,667 estimated deliveries in Q3 and Q4.

Previously this analysis resulted in a similar number (slightly smaller) but I still placed a higher probability on the lower bucket because I didn't take the Tesla 7k target at face value. However, I am now adjusting that view and assume there is a higher chance that Tesla hits the 7k by year end. There are three reasons for this:\n1) Tesla had a record Q2, with orders exceeding deliveries, implying an increase in backlog.\n2) Tesla is planning to increase production and is hiring more workers. This is not the behavior of a manufacturer that is constrained by demand.

We are now at 191.8k delivered M3s, with \"7,400 vehicles in transit\", which works out to ~6k M3s in transit if we work out the fractions. I believe this lets us rule out the top two buckets. Even counting the 6k in transit, in order to break 380k, Tesla would need to have started producing 7k/week on 1 July 2019, and deliver every last car they made, even the ones made on 31 Dec 2019. Obviously that won't happen; they are currently making ~6k/week, and it takes at least 2 weeks to deliver a car, probably more like 4 weeks on average. Even if China factory comes online soon, it can't make up for the shortfall of at least a quarter producing 6k/week instead of 7k/week. So I zero out top bucket, and leave 1% in [380k,430k].

Unlikely to make anything.\n[usLow, usMid, usHigh] = [330, 341, 346]\n[chinaLow, chinaMid, chinaHigh] = [0, 1, 3] The output of my program tells me to put 100% on the [330k,380k] bucket. That feels overconfident, not least because my code doesn't take demand into account at all. On the other hand, as I argued in a previous comment [3], there were conservatively 350k reservation holders at the start of the period in question, which is enough to get us into that bucket. I don't know how many cancel, but presumably some also acquire new reservations. A little more upside is given by the fact that Tesla has started selling cheaper used M3s [4], and there are over 70k M3s made in 2018Q3 or earlier. Still, I will temper the program's recommendation down to a 20/80 split since other good forecasters (@Emil, @nigster, @cafebedouin, @ddorsey) are far from 100% on any single bucket.

Alternatively, assumes Q4 share is 80k, then we\u2019d have 330k.  This is all assuming H1 = H2. An argument can be made that H2 will be lower due to the lower tax credit and the fact that people are probably rushing purchases now.

There's 222 days left in the year or ~275 to cover the three remaining quarters.  That puts a floor, based on U.S. production only, of around 200,000 cars for the three quarters. Or, 310,000 if we add 112,000 from the first two quarters. This aligns pretty closely with: \"Tesla delivered just 63,000 cars in the first quarter but expects to deliver 90,000 to 100,000 cars in the second quarter, and 360,000 to 400,000 for the year. Ives said hitting the full-year target is going to be a 'Herculean task' and sees 340,000 to 355,000 as a more likely scenario.\"[2]  Note: The most likely scenario described here is all Tesla cars. Let's assume Model 3s are 70% of deliveries, then the 238,000 to 250,000 for full year 2019 and then we need to add 61,000 for 2018Q1, which makes it 300,000 to 315,000, or in line with my estimate above. I think there are two unaccounted for variables. First, will Tesla be able to squeeze more cars out of their U.S. production line. My sense is that is a constrained factor, probably only accounting for <10,000 in variability.  Second, when will Chinese production come online? If we assume the Chinese factor comes online in September and makes an average of a 1,000 cars a week, that's 20,000 cars. But, I honestly have no idea what kind of ramp up to expect here. Will they start three lines of 1,000 a piece? Could they do as many as 2,000 a week per line on average for the period? It could be anywhere in the range of 20,000 to 100,000 additional vehicles. I'm going to put a small hedge on 280,000 but less than 330,000, just in case China doesn't come online or cannot produce cars at volume. But, I'm really skeptical that will be the case and am only going to hedge a little, 5%. It seems unlikely to me that the Chinese factory will get to 120,000 cars this year, so simple hedge of 5% on top option. Rest I'm going weight the third slightly more than the fourth option.  I think the Chinese factory makes it impossible to reduce the random chance further.

As in my previous forecasts, I lay out three scenarios. In all three I consider production up to 4 weeks before the deadline, to allow for delivery delays.

These are already produced and will definitely be delivered before 1 Jan 2020. So I feel it makes sense to include them.

Summary: a pure production-based analysis suggests a base case forecast of 368k. However, demand pulls the probability distribution down a bit. First, from a purely production perspective:  Production is currently just above 5k [1]. In January, Tesla said it will reach annualized production of 7k by year end. [2] That's for the US factory. They also said the Shanghai factory would be starting at a rate of 3k per week [2].  Later Musk tweeted he expected an annualized rate corresponding to 500k deliveries [3], implying a rate per week of 9,615 but it's not clear if he was talking about Model 3 or total. Assume he was talking just Model 3's. it seems he was talking about both factories, not just the US one (since the context of his tweet was total Tesla production).  Key consideration: does the China factory matter for the purpose of this question? Musk said: \"\"Aiming to finish initial construction this summer, start Model 3 production end of year & reach high volume production next year,\" the billionaire entrepreneur said.\" [4] This suggests that the Chinese factory should be out of the question.  Therefore, any forecasts that rely on Musk's tweet about annualized production by end of 2019 risk overestimating the actual production relevant for this question (If you take the current 5k and extrapolate linearly to the stated 9.6k by 2019, you will be overestimating since you will be accounting for growth toward the 9.6k that won't materialize linearly. Instead there will be a discrete step-jump once the China factory starts producing). So what could production actually look like purely based on Tesla statements? Start at 5k at the start of the year and raise linearly to 7k by end of year. This suggests production of 312k for 2019. Assuming deliveries lag production by two weeks, deliveries would be 307k. Adding the 61k from Q4 2018 would lead to a forecast of 368k. Second, from a demand perspective:  We know very little about demand for Model 3's. Initially Tesla had 400k+ reservations but as @nigster has shown [5] those have whittled down possibly to something like 260k or less. Tesla's tactics of reducing prices twice in the last couple of months further imply they have a demand problem. Tesla follower behind the crowdsourced spreadsheet who goes by Troy Teslike estimated new orders of 1700-2000 per week in the US [6]. Of course, that's before Tesla unveiled the 35k version.  The closing of showrooms might dent demand a little but I can easily see large throngs of people buying the car online (rough analogy - buying mattresses online seemed strange at first but it has proven very popular).  Still, demand could turn out weaker, and I assume it puts downward pressure on the probability distribution.

That's why fires in the former sorts of vehicles don't make the news; this is of course a bit unfair to the nice people at Tesla.    However, the batteries in Teslas seem to be much more inclined to start burning on their own initiative, without the excitement of an actual crash to get them started.

I was able to find some evidence for this: * Volvo factory in South Carolina\n   Broke ground in Sep 2015 [2], opened in Jun 2018 [3]. Total area 774k sq.f. [4].\n* Mercedes-Benz factory in Alabama\n   Expansion of an existing factory. Schedule: 30 months. Total area: 1.6M sq.f. [5]\n* Toyota factory in Texas\n   Broke ground in Oct 2003. Four years of construction. Total area: 2M sq.f. [6]\n* Toyota -Mazda plant in Alabama\n   Construction to start next month and take at least 2 years. Total area: 3.3M sq.f. [7]\n* Hyundai factory in Alabama\n   Three years between groundbreaking and grand opening [8]. Total area: 2M sq.f. [9] For comparison, the current Tesla factory is 5.3M sq.f. (Google). The plot of land in China is ~9.3M sq.f. Adding to this Musk's extreme tendency to (publicly) underestimate project timelines, it does seem very unlikely that the Tesla factory in China will produce any significant number of cars this year, much less deliver them. So I change the numbers in my model to be: China pessimistic case = 0; China normal case = 1k; China optimistic case = 5k. The code is below the references.

Thanks to @cafebedouin for bringing up good points. Most importantly, I had misread the weekly production graph in [2] as saying that prod rates had remained ~constant over the past 3 months, whereas the reality is they simply changed how the displayed rate is computed: \"An update to the model on Oct. 2 adopted a 13-week trailing average for our weekly estimate.\" If I am reading the thin, light green bars right, they surpassed 6k/week for a couple of weeks, including the latest week. I've set it up as follows. There are two factories, US and China. For each one I came up with a pessimistic, a normal, and an optimistic output. Then I made a probability density for the true output in the simplest way: a triangle graph that starts at zero at the pessimistic output, peaks at the normal output, then decays again to zero at the optimistic output. (1) US factory:\n* Pessimistic: keep 5k/week production rate constant throughout the year (260k total);\n* Normal: linearly increases from current 4.6k/week to 7k/week at year-end (302k total);\n* Optimistic: linearly increases from current 4.6k/week to 10k/week at year-end (380k total). (2) China factory:\n* Pessimistic: comes online after Q3 (3 weeks into Q4) and only averages 1k/week for rest of year (10k total);\n* Normal: China factory comes online precisely in the middle of 2019H2 and scales production linearly from 1k/week to 3k/week (26k total);\n* Optimistic: China factory comes online early (6 weeks into) H2, and scales linearly from 2k/week to 5k/week (70k total). Then, assuming independence, the histogram for their sum is easy to compute by convolution. Here is the Python code: # Density function for US production\ndef US(q):\n..if q <= 260:\n....return 0.0\n..if 260 < q <= 302:\n....return (q-260.0)/(42*60)\n..if 302 < q <= 380:\n....return 1/60.0 - (q-302.0)/(78*60)\n..if 380 < q:\n....return 0.0 # Density function for China production\ndef China(q):\n..if q <= 10:\n....return 0.0\n..if 10 < q <= 26:\n....return (q-10.0)/(30*16)\n..if 26 < q <= 70:\n....return 1/30.0 - (q-26.0)/(30*44)\n..if 70 < q:\n....return 0.0 total = [0]*460\nfor s in range(0,460):\n..total[s] = sum([ US(i)*China(s-i) for i in range(0,s+1) ]) [1] https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/820690\n[2] https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-tesla-tracker/?terminal=true"], [172, "2019-01-22T01:27:08Z", [0.85, 0.15, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [23006, "2019-01-21T22:20:53Z", [0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "Most governments have done away with tax credit for electric vehicles, and price without the credit prices  the car out of reach of masses...orders have been cancelled.

Not really "], [23879, "2019-01-21T04:39:22Z", [0.1, 0.4, 0.49, 0.01, 0.0], "In 2018Q4 we had 63,150 deliveries [1]. According to the Bloomberg tracker [2], Tesla is making 4,684 Model 3s per week. So the simplest prediction is 63,150 + 52x4,684 ~ 307k. This is almost exactly the middle of the second bucket. Yes, I am substituting \"deliveries\" for \"production\". There is so much demand for Model 3s that I believe the only bottleneck is production. In the 2018Q1 investor letter [3] they say there were over 450k reservations at 2018Q1 end. They delivered 18,449 in 2018Q2 [4] and 56,065 in 2018Q3 [5], so there must be at least ~375k reservations remaining for the Q period. And remember, they only stopped taking reservations because they moved to a direct order system now that production rates are up [5]. Let's try to discard some buckets. Apparently Musk said in 2016 that by 2020 Tesla would be making 500k cars per year. Now, (i) the norm for Musk is to wildly overpredict future performance; (ii) this Q is about 2019, not 2020; and (iii) It's 500k cars total, and the Q is about Model 3s (in 2018 there were ~100k non-Model 3 deliveries [1]). So I discard the >430k bucket, and give only 1% to 380k-430k. At the other end, for us to go under 280k, we'd have to average ~54.2k cars per quarter in 2019. This is less than the deliveries in Q3, when production was still ramping up. With the ramp up complete (in some way), a new factory in China planned for 2019H2 [6], and deliveries to start in Europe and China, it seems very unlikely to me that we would consistently underperform 2018Q3. Let's call it 10% since I don't know enough about this area to have \"5%\" levels of confidence. Now, how could we get to 330k-380k? The China factory is supposed to make 3k cars/week when it begins operation [7]. Since we only know it is planned to be put \"partially into operation in the second half of 2019\", let's guess the middle of 2019H2; that gives 13 weeks of operation, for a total of 39k cars. Added to the 306.7k baseline prediction from the first paragraph, we get to ~346k, the lower end of third bucket. Or, to work backwards: the China factory needs to make/deliver ~23k cars above the baseline prediction to put us over 330k; that's ~8 weeks at 3k/week; or ~1.8k/week if we assume they get 13 weeks of operation. When I put it this way it actually seems quite likely to me; if we assume that a significant reason for the 2018 delays was some discovery process (of how to best set up the production line etc), then the discoveries have been made, and the set up time should be much shorter now. Moreover, the baseline calculation from the first paragraph assumes production rates in the US will stay constant; but there's no reason that should be the case. Given how new the production line is, there are probably still improvements that can be made. So I rate 330k-380k as slightly more likely than 280k-330k.

Musk, Tesla\u2019s charismatic chief executive officer, has pitched it as the company\u2019s first car for the masses, with a base price of just $35,000. Thousands of those deposit holders still are standing by, and they could spell trouble for Tesla -- whether they stay patient or not. Selling too many Model 3s at that price too soon would put the company out of business, Musk tweeted last year. At the very least, it undermines Tesla\u2019s profitability, as he alluded to in an email to staff on Friday. He announced Tesla will cut about 7 percent of its workforce -- roughly more than 3,000 employees. On the other hand, would-be customers like Nevine Melikian are running low on patience.

The recent price drop from Tesla to assist with those buying cars after the tax credit deadline is indicative that a switch is not going to be soon - there's all of the higher priced (higher margin) European buyers to satisfy first.

Given that the tax credit just expired, they may not be so easy to move. The just-in-time philosophy long ago led most manufacturers to abhor building up inventory. Demand ramps up, speed up the production line. Demand falters, slow the production line and deliver just in time for customer demand without building up inventory. Have you ever looks in the \"back\" of a department store or grocery store lately? There is no \"back\" in most of these because shipments go directly to the shelves. So if Tesla really has >3,300 Model 3s in inventory, OK, this is less than half of one day's delivery (769) at the lowest bucket. So this doesn't look like a big deal to me. On the other hand, the normal Tesla situation has been that sales were limited by production. Indeed, it is not unusual across the automotive industry that many sales require some waiting by the customer as the factory produces the vehicle the customer wants. Another factor -- that tax break just was cut in half. So in effect, the price of a Model 3 just rose by $3,750. Will this slow sales by much?

U.S.: It looks like Tesla delivered 55k Model 3s in the U.S. in Q4 2018 based on the Tesla Model spreadsheet. If we project the same over 5 quarters, this gets us to a floor of 275,000.[1]  I think you have to build in some sales increase over the year.

If we assume 5k per week for 64 weeks, that would mean 320k manufactured.  However, that is speaking from a supply side perspective only. Demand (from the US) could be as low as 1k per week [3]. I think this number is on the low side as it is looking at historical demand over a short time period (admittedly we have limited data for demand beyond the reservation holders). Going forward, demand is likely to rise as familiarity increases and charger become more widely available. Though note that the declining federal tax credit will weigh on demand. Also, in 2019, Tesla will probably start moving larger volumes in Canada and Europe as well as possibly China (though Tesla would have a hard time competing there). That could add another couple of thousand (even that seems a little optimistic though I don't have hard data to back that up for now). An important question: have all the US pre-orders been met now? Yes according to sources quoted by @nigster [4] To stay above 280k, the weekly rate has to be 4.38k or above. Even if US demand is triple the 1k reported above, it seems difficult to top that bar.

M3 price is up in the luxury category.

What we don't know what is the sustainable stable state. Also we don't know if Musk will drop the prices and how much. If Tesla drops M3 prices to Camry level, then US demand might even increase. Tesla would likely lose (a lot?) money on such pricing though. International (European and Canadian mostly) demand probably can cover US shortfall assuming US drops less than 30% from peak. Looking another way, Camry sales in US were 388K in 2016-2017. What would be Tesla stable state sales in US compared to Camry? If it is more than 2/3 of Camry sales, then Tesla hits top brackets. If it's around 1/2, then not.  It is possible that US won't drop more than 30% from peak and that international will cover US drop and that production issues won't happen. I still think Tesla won't hit top bracket. It may hit brackets below that though.

Based on trade-ins received from customers since the start of Model 3 production, more than half of those trade-in vehicles were priced below $35,000 when new. It is clear that customers are trading up their relatively cheaper vehicles to buy a Model 3 even though there is not yet a leasing option and the Q3 starting price of a Model 3 was $49,000. This leads us to believe that the total market potential for Model 3 is larger than just the premium sedan market. Additionally, we are working hard to bring down the price of Model 3 to $35,000... We stopped taking Model 3 reservations in North America in early July 2018 when we moved to a direct order system. Of the 455,000 net reservations that we reported in August 2017, less than 20% have cancelled. We are expecting most of the remaining reservations to gradually convert to orders as we launch more versions of Model 3, introduce other financing options, and begin sales outside North America.\"[1] So, 455,000 in net reservations. They've delivered, let's say 100,000. Let's say they lose 25% because of production wait.[2] That's 255,000 in unfilled orders to start. They are opening up into new markets, such as Europe and China, and they are going to have new financing options? Why are sales a problem again, @nigster? Because there is only a few weeks lag in the direct sales system? Give the above, I don't really see that as a problem. As to production, end of Q3 2018, Tesla is at 5,000 cars a week or 714 cars a day. 60 days later, they are at 1,000/day or 50,000 for this quarter thus far.[3] With 365 days in a year + 30 days in December, we have ~395 days. That's 395,000 + 50,000 = 445,000, assuming no further improvement.  Why would Tesla ramp up their production by 2,000 if sales are a problem? It doesn't make sense. I still think batteries are the limiting factor, but their first Gigafactory is only 30% built out.[4] And they are investing $3 billion per year in production capacity.[5]   I think I have to go back to the high end on my prediction, given the above.

(EDIT 3: It was really dumb of me to believe the \"1,000 cars per week\" claim because that article was effectively just \"a guy on the internet\".)\nIf that report is true it's not just bad for Tesla, it's catastrophic. So why hasn't the share price reacted? There must be something I'm missing (EDIT: yes you're missing the fact that it's just a guy on the internet) but I'm putting in this new lower forecast until I find evidence to the contrary. (EDIT: because you're an idiot.) Maybe Europe or China will rescue them. UPDATE 18 Dec 2019;\nFor future reference here's a quick summary of the current situation.\nTesla are marketing geniuses. They created massive hype for the Model 3 and turned that hype into a reservation list. When production started, people from the reservation list were invited to place orders which created an order backlog. As weekly production volumes increased, the backlog declined and eventually disappeared which is where we are now. Anyone can now place an order and receive their car within a couple of weeks. There are people still on the reservation list but they are not placing orders, presumably because they are waiting for the promised $35k Model 3.\nSo the crazy production figures of 1,000 cars per day were not sustainable from a sales point of view - they were just the result of trying to clear the backlog. They were also an excellent marketing opportunity, which Tesla fully exploited. Tesla have just opened up the configurator to buyers in 5 European countries which will presumably create a similar spike in demand.\nSo the task is to somehow separate the short-lived demand spikes created by the reservations system, from the ongoing sales when demand settles down. That is the key to forecasting total sales for the remaining 4 quarters of this question. UPDATE 24 Dec 2018;\nI think that underlying Model 3 sales (i.e. excluding the backlog) in North American are currently 1,277 per week. This figure is derived as follows: Troy Teslike estimates that underlying weekly sales are \"1700-2000\". I think he is overestimating because he isn't accounting for VIN gaps. Bloomberg do account for those gaps, so comparing Bloombergs estimate for total weekly sales of 4,100 to Troy's of 5,900, would mean that underlying sales are 69% of Troy's estimate. So that's 69% of 1,850 = 1,277. ONGOING EDIT:\nUsing the Bloomberg Tesla Model 3 Tracker [2] (thanks @acohen) to project the total number of Tesla Model 3's expected to be manufactured in the time frame of this question (updated weekly-ish); Sun 25 Nov 2018: 130,307 Total cars. 4,415 per week. 36,038 in the current quarter. Projection: 57 x 4,415 + 36,038 = 287,693\nSat 01 Dec 2018: 131,804 Total cars, 4,224 per week, 37,535 in the current quarter.

Projection: 52 x 4,606 + 60,163 = 299,675 * * Bloomberg must have adjusted their methodology here because their figure for the current quarter increased in one week by two weeks sales.

That will get them well above the highest choice. This looks unlikely unless you consider the fact that profitability will allow them to invest in more production and consolidate gains.

So, are we assume that there is a backlog of orders and they have inventory that can be delivered? Again the Q3 report says: \"Despite logistical challenges earlier in the quarter, our US inventory at the end of  Q3 (including customer vehicles in transit, test drive vehicles, service loaners and engineering fleet \u2013 all of which accounted for the vast majority of our inventory) remains the lowest in the industry when measured in terms of days of sales.\"   Either I'm missing something crucial or this question is."], [1333, "2018-11-18T21:00:34Z", [0.1, 0.2, 0.55, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [59882, "2018-11-18T19:03:43Z", [0.6, 0.35, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0], "Based on the the VIN chart page of the Troy order tracker spreadsheet [1], confirmed total Tesla Model 3 units produced;\n- 41,029 on 30 June 2018\n- 94,268 on 30 Sept 2018 So 53,239 for Q3 2018. At that rate they would produce 266,195 in 5 quarters. Up until now, sales have been limited by supply. When and at what level will sales start to be limited by demand? What happened to the supposed 400k+ units order backlog??? New orders are being fulfilled within weeks, so surely that means the backlog has disappeared. If that is the case and the backlog is gone, then this is a critical moment for Tesla, possibly an existential one. How will their sales figures hold up if they are now relying on new customers instead of their order backlog? The Tesla 3 could be the future of car manufacturing, or a fad, a craze.
