It appears that the drop in the price of the pound has not stimulated industrial output (not a surprise to most economists who had already noted that in an economy like the UK's. changes in exchange rates no longer have a very great effect on output figures for manufactured goods. In the UK's case lack of available capacity and disinclination to invest in increasing it due to economic uncertainty is only being partly offset by increases in service activity. Larger inflation increases due to the fall in the pound are forecast. I had thought the effects might reach the 2% by the end of 2016, but it now looks more likely that the 2% figure will not show up until Q1 or even Q2 2017 (an annual rate of  1.7% for 2016 now seems more likely).

So even with a 10% chance individually (if uncorrelated) the total probability of one event would be 73%.  However, the events are not uncorrelated and we're over half way through 2016. I think it can be said with some confidence that it is unlikely any country will experience over 2.5% growth in 2016. Data for the first half of the year is now in and the US is closest with 2.2% forecast (IMF) however, H1 growth was 1%, so we'd need to see some upward revisions to H1 (which happens quite a lot btw) and approximately 4% growth in H2. Germany seems next most likely, but improbable, the world would need some kind of 'growth shock' in H2 and historical precedent suggests such shocks are more likely to carry downside rather than upside risk. Thus perhaps a 20% chance that the US delivers a phenomenal H2 and hits 4% and maybe a 3% chance that any other country does individually (i.e. a once in 33 year event feels about right). Inflation seems easier to hit, especially if the oil price accelerates, which it could, and the UK could also be a candidate if the currency weakness translates to inflation sooner than expected (via larger import prices) or if the rate of VAT was increased, as Japan did fairly recently. Though even here inflation was around 0.5% in H1 so a spike to roughly 4% in H2 would be needed, this would require import prices to be passed through very quickly, perhaps a 15% chance since we'd also need oil to spike or some other big shock. A similar picture is true of the other 6 countries, though without a falling currency, rising inflation seems even less probable, perhaps 3% chance. This the chance of 2.5% growth and 2% inflation NOT occurring is 0.8 for the US x 0.97^6 for everyone else x 0.85 for UK inflation and 0.97^6 for everyone else on inflation. So a 47% chance of everything NOT happening, or a 53% (1-47%) chance of the event happening. Net - this seems unlikely but it's hard to get to complete certainty given an of the 7 countries could still do something unexpected across the 2 variables in H2, but Q3 I'd expect the probability to come down pretty dramatically if things go to trend because 4% growth or inflation for 6 months is possible, but by Q4 we may need to see ~7% growth or maybe ~7% inflation in Q4 to clear the hurdle rate and that seems extremely unlikely. Where I'm really coming down on this is driven by the statistics, not so much the economics. With 14 somewhat independent events you need to have extremely high conviction, perhaps 99% that each one won't happen, for the overall probability to be low i.e. .99^14 = 0.87 or 87% chance. And at this stage in the year particularly regarding US growth and UK inflation as wildcards in H2 I don't have that much confidence, hence the idea that any single country has a small risk of surprise creates a seemingly high overall probability."], [368, "2016-08-18T19:57:44Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-08-18T16:16:08Z", [0.15], ""], [28343, "2016-08-18T04:52:52Z", [0.35], ""], [28315, "2016-08-18T00:14:28Z", [0.2], "Only one of these countries has had annual GDP growth or inflation growth above 2.5% and 2% in the last 2 years.

Citigroup economists are the highest major firm at 2.1%. On the balance of probabilities here, perhaps only something like a 5% chance that the US gets to this type of growth metric. In terms of Canadian inflation a single house of the 21 economists in the survey is at 2.1%. Maybe an outside chance of sub 3% that this could trigger a YES.

Adjusting the PCE to remove volatility food and energy sectors (Core PCE) still leads the level of inflation below the 2% target.   My forecast of 33% allows for the fact that there is some level of possibility that any one of the G-7 countries will have higher growth or inflation.  However, Italy, Germany and France have had minimal inflation and growth for some time. Therefore, the probability of one of these countries exceeding the growth or inflation targets are very low.  Likewise, Japan's economy has exhibited very low growth and inflation for many years and the consquence of the recently introduced 'negative interest rates' are likely not stimulative, and may in fact be actually recessionary.

Looking at it that way, my initial 20% last month seems too low, as is the current consensus of 22%. Rough justification is given below. https://knoema.com/kyaewad/us-inflation-forecast-2015-2020-and-up-to-2060-data-and-charts\nThe Knoema website is very useful for a quick survey. From it, one can safely rule out Japan, Italy and France for both GDP and inflation. However,for the other four countries, the US looks the most likely for GDP growth, with the average of five predictions coming to 2.484% with a standard deviation of 0.311% (the IMF, whose report will actually decide this IFP, has the US at 2.4).   The UK is averaging 2.3% (s.d =0.27), Germany 1.88% (sd=.33) while Canada,(though averaging 2.0% with sd=0.4), looks less likely due to reduced oil output and low prices. The IMF has the UK at 1.9, Canada and Germany both at 1.5.  Without any further calculations, I'm guessing that the chance, based on these numbers, of at least one of the US or the UK reaching an average of 2.5% is better than 60% (I'm currently not in the mood to look up statistical tables beyond having found the above numbers from Excel). For inflation, Canada seems the most likely, with the average of 5 predictions at 1.77% and s.d of 0.28%.  A depreciated Canadian dollar due to low oil prices is likely to keep importing inflation. The US is a more remote possibility, averaging 1.1% (though the European Commission is an outlier, predicting 2.1%). I'd guess that there's roughly a 20% chance that Canadian inflation could exceed 2%. Thus, the chance that the averages of reports from four or five different organizations will have at least one country with GDP of 2.5% or inflation of 2.0% could be as much as 80%. However, the IMF numbers are of the order of one standard deviation less than the average, so I'll arbitrarily set my forecast at 50%. I'd appreciate it if someone more astute at statistics would comment.

Zero, or even negative, growth is now a possibility, said Mr. Burleton of Toronto-Dominion Bank.  The full toll will depend largely on the health of the oil sands. \"The largest projects, north of Fort McMurray have been largely unscathed, protected in part by their wide, deforested perimeters.  . . .  production was slowly starting up again at several plants, since Fort McMurray no longer appears to be under imminent threat. But oil companies are still assessing the damage to the electrical network, the aboveground buildings and the pipelines that ship Fort McMurray\u2019s production. Then there is the complex nature of the projects, which means that oil will not necessarily start flowing again quickly. . . . Suncor\u2019s initial assessment, Mr. Williams said, found that the pipeline system is in good shape, since it is largely underground. But there is far more work to be done to the electrical networks. \"The status of smaller plants, which are largely south of the city, is less clear. That area remains under a mandatory evacuation order because of the lingering potential for renewed fire. The southern plants, for the most part, bring the tarlike bitumen of the oil sands to the surface by injecting vast quantities of steam underground. Plants of that variety, like Japan Canada Oil Sands, have been operating for several years and have built up so much heat underground they can sit idle for up to 12 months and be restarted with comparative ease.\n. . . \n\"Goldman Sachs estimates that the lost production, assuming companies can ramp up production over 10 days, will total 14 million barrels. If so, that would have a relatively minor impact on North American stockpiles, which are nearly full. But not everything in those stockpiles suits the needs of American refineries that rely on heavy oil produced in the sands. \n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  The bit of information pertinent to this question is in the first sentence, but I included the rest because I found it so interesting (who knew that you could inject so much steam heat into the ground that it would stay hot for a year!) and because perhaps we'll have another oil price question."], [691, "2016-05-12T15:03:04Z", [0.23], ""], [4407, "2016-05-12T14:11:27Z", [0.5], ""], [691, "2016-05-12T03:49:51Z", [0.23], ""], [102, "2016-05-12T03:26:20Z", [0.4], "https://larswericson.wordpress.com/2016/05/12/gitrep-11may16pm/"], [19106, "2016-05-12T01:53:39Z", [0.05], ""], [368, "2016-05-11T21:59:36Z", [0.05], ""], [21442, "2016-05-11T14:04:04Z", [0.9], ""], [15621, "2016-05-11T08:47:16Z", [0.09], ""], [94, "2016-05-11T03:58:32Z", [0.4], ""], [7445, "2016-05-11T00:25:42Z", [0.02], ""], [368, "2016-05-10T19:14:34Z", [0.05], ""], [506, "2016-05-10T15:48:50Z", [0.03], ""], [24848, "2016-05-10T15:18:55Z", [0.4], ""], [1639, "2016-05-10T14:54:10Z", [0.05], "Thanks to @Dima-K for his forecasts\nhttps://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/228000 For a change of view I used the stats from the OECD rather than the WEO\nfor 2015 the inflation ratio (first column in %); the growth to GDP (second column in %); third column is the expected growth to GDP for 2016  Canada  0.63  0.5  1.5 US  0.68  2.0  2.4 Italy  0.2  1.0  1.0 Germany  0.28  1.3  1.5 France  -0.02  1.4  1.1 UK  -0.10  2.1  1.9 Japan  0.19  0.8  0.5 The country that had the highest spike in inflation in the last 10 years was Canada; but according to the IMF for 2016 Canada inflation rate is projected at 1.347; the country with the best growth to GDP projection is the US with 2.4%, considering that this is a turbulent election year I doubt that the growth to GDP will be over 2.5% I will leave my forecast at 5% for now."], [19923, "2016-05-10T13:57:48Z", [0.49], ""], [21800, "2016-05-10T13:07:54Z", [0.08], "There are some well researched posts in the Top rated section of this question.

For inflation: I think all 7 probabilities are close enough to zero, with perhaps the exception of Canada, that we can round even their disjunction to zero. Even Canada seems exceedingly unlikely. Furthermore, I think that more QE in any of these countries is starting to become more difficult in a geopolitical sense, even if there is no actual currency accord (http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2016/04/12/2159112/did-the-g20-agree-a-currency-accord-and-does-it-matter/).  Without the lever of monetary stimulus, I don;t see inflation topping 2% in any of these countries this year, so I'm going to round this half to 0. I also think there are more downside risks globally than upside. On GDP growth, it's worth noting that the WB has overestimated GDP growth every year since 2007, with the exception of 2010 and 2012 (http://www.un.org/esa/desa/papers/2014/wp133_2014.pdf). The OECD also had troubles with forecasting error (https://www.oecd.org/economy/oecd-forecasts-during-and-after-the-financial-crisis-a-post-mortem.htm). Though they claim to have since adjusted their methodology after learning from this. It's worth noting that the OECD Feb forecast predicts only 2% RGDP growth for the USA (https://www.oecd.org/eco/outlook/OECD-February-2016-Interim-Economic-Outlook-Forecasts-data.xlsx). Plus there's no chance of Fed assistance eg rate cuts (indeed everyone is waiting for a hike - but this requires the economy to return to health), so I think downside risks dominate here. Ultimately, this question collapses to just \"will US growth be >2.5%?\". Given the trend, and OECD data, and everything else, I reckon it's a 2 sigma event despite the current WB forecast being so close to 2.5 ( I think it will be revised down again), so put this at just 2%!

Also more current is the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in March (with their April meeting finishing today), wherein only 1-2/19 members said that the US would hit 2.5% growth (figure 3.B): https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20160316.pdf These estimates are generally pretty accurate: https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2015/files/2015062pap.pdf Taking these current sources into account I think there is a low, but significant chance of breaking 2.5%, so I'll put my estimate of this at 15%, saying there are about 1.5 SD between the IMF prediction and 2.5%. Knoema also compiles Canadian inflation projections: http://knoema.com/ibldsdb/canada-inflation-forecast-2015-2019-and-up-to-2060-data-and-charts Only the OECD projects Canada over 2% CPI inflation at 2.03%, while the IMF, UN, and European Commission all place Canada's inflation rate below 2%.

Putting them together (hi US GDP @ 15%, hi CA CPI inflation @15%), and assuming they're independent (which they aren't, but close enough), the probability of neither happening is .85^2, or 72%, so the probability of a yes to this question is 28%."], [24159, "2016-04-27T05:41:55Z", [0.3], ""], [24159, "2016-04-27T03:33:08Z", [0.1], "Predictions are all over the place.

However, some doomsayers are still predicting a US recession this year, though most forecasters put chances of this happening at less than 20% The Conference Board , in its 13 April 2016 update https://www.conference-board.org/data/usforecast.cfm is predicting 1.6% growth for US GDP in 2016. Thus, chances of the US exceeding 2.5% this year seem low, but one has to allow for uncertainties this early in the year. Most forecasts expect 2016 to be slow globally, though.

The base effects will be meaningful. Also, if the UK votes to stay in we could see them reach 2.5% GDP although the Q1 print will be weak so it's more of a stretch. No other country will come close to hitting either threshold unless we get a oil supply shock (unlikely) or Japan decides to experiment with chopper money and that leads to accelerated inflation (also unlikely).

However, I think that inflation estimates are generally too low.  The reason is that oil prices were already quite low in the second half of 2015, and oil prices have been having a very negative effect on the rate of inflation over the past year.  But if oil rebounds modestly this year, then oil prices would start to have a positive effect on the rate of inflation, which would lead to temporarily high inflation in the second half of 2016.  This article outlines the general idea:\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2015/october/predicting-impact-oil-prices-inflation Core CPI is already above 2% in the US, though the headline CPI only came in at 1% in the first quarter:\nhttps://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=4gir\nHowever, this was with oil prices down 30% from the first quarter of 2015.  Oil prices averaged $58 a barrel in the second quarter last year, so it will likely still have a negative effect in the second quarter, but prices averaged $46 and $42 in the third and fourth quarters.  If oil prices rebound above $50 in the second half of the year, inflation could easily be over 2% in the U.S.  The question would then be whether it was high enough to offset inflation of around 1% in the first half of the year. I think inflation under 2% is still more likely, but both the U.S. and Canada have a chance of having higher than 2% inflation this year if oil prices rise modestly.

Given the IMF's warning this month about stagnating growth, I think I will take the under on this implicit proposition.  I will adjust probabilities based on actual second and third quarter performance.   Given what I have found, I wonder what this question is supposed to accomplish?  Its really obvious that the vast majority of G7 countries will not exceed 2.5% growth or 2.0% inflation.  So why calibrate the question in this manner?
