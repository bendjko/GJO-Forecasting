The remarks were a blunt reminder of the gloom underscoring U.S. military assessments of the war between the U.S.-backed Afghan government and the Islamist militant group, classified by U.S. commanders as a \"stalemate\" despite almost 16 years of fighting. \"We are not winning in Afghanistan right now. And we will correct this as soon as possible,\" Mattis said in testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee. Mattis acknowledged that he believed the Taliban were \"surging\" at the moment, something he said he intended to address. Some U.S. officials questioned the benefit of sending more troops to Afghanistan because any politically palatable number would not be enough to turn the tide, much less create stability and security. To date, more than 2,300 Americans have been killed and more than 17,000 wounded since the war began in 2001 (para. 1-4). Reuters reported in late April that the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump was carrying out a review of Afghanistan, and conversations were revolving around sending between 3,000 and 5,000 U.S. and coalition troops there (para. 8). Deliberations include giving more authority to forces on the ground and taking more aggressive action against Taliban fighters (para. 8-9). Stewart, P. & Ali, I. (2017).

That fact is good for the Afghani people because genocide typically takes place in areas the offenders are going to leave after the fact.  Whichever government, sect, or terrorist group ends up in power in Afghanistan will need some cooperation from the people, and genocide would hurt their chance to maintain power.

Now, due to its high birth-rate the population keeps growing, still imagine having 51.3 years of live expectancy, and a birth rate of 38.1 per 1000 or 300% of the US!  \nSpecifically, looking at the total casualties in Afghanistan we are at: 25 639  for 2016 and consistent with the 2015 pattern, those are recognized deaths due to the conflict, it also relates to the drug trade. It is a fact that becoming a mercenary (anything related to the armed conflict)  or a drug trader are the two most popular employment solutions to earn some decent money with young afghans. \nConsidering that the religious battles at this point are just an excuse to control the drug trade from Kabul, the escalation in the civilian casualties in large scale will evolve from large amount of action and the casualties from small numbers will surmount to the trend.\nIf we are going to see a major event of 1000 plus casualties as a routine, the risk provability will be higher in the areas of Nangarhar, Logar  and Patkia where the illegal trade is higher and the Pasthu power structure collides in many fronts.   \nThe US has allowed the drug lords to continue to control large parts of the central government and allow then to keep their turf as long as they collaborate.
