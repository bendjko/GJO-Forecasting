By not having a permit, Uber wouldn\u2019t have to provide that data, which the California DMV posts on its public web site.\"  Given that Uber has still not reported the results of its \"investigation\" of the late October accident in Pittsburgh, I have now concluded that Uber will only admit to accidents that are serious enough that it cannot deny them. I suspect that Uber's reluctance to obtain the $150 permit that California is demanding due to multiple factors, including a philosophical resistance to overregulation but also a preference to retain some optionality with respect to accident reporting. I don't know much about the Pittsburgh situation, which is the one where the greatest current accident exposure exists, but I have heard that Uber chose Pittsburgh in part because the local authorities were more accommodating than others. If so, and that idea  is supported by the lack of clarity over that late October accident, then I suspect we will not know soon whether or not an accident has occurred in Pittsburgh within the GJ prescribed period.

The question requires that the vehicle be driving autonomously at the time of the accident; this may be something difficult to discern.  Uber may seek to shift all blame onto human drivers, or may pressure those involved to not file an accident report.  No report = no accident.

According to http://www.wtae.com/article/self-driving-uber-involved-in-collision-downtown/8059178 there was a collision between a self-driving Uber vehicle and another car on October 19. However, it's not clear whether the car was driving autonomously at the time so I don't know whether this definitely counts - I'm assuming not. Borrowing heavily from AABoyles' excellent logic, but with some modifications:\n- It sounds like Volvo will deliver 100 cars by the end of 2016, and then Uber will have to outfit the cars with their autonomous technology. I'm not sure how long this takes but I would guess that not all 100 cars will be on the road by the end of 2016. Let's say they have 50 on the road by the end of the year. (http://www.theverge.com/2016/8/18/12541672/uber-volvo-partnership-autonomous-self-driving-car)\n- An average Uber driver earns around $30 per hour in Pittsburgh, which I think equates to around 15-20 miles driven per hour. Assume that these cars are in use for 12 hours a day, then that's about 200 miles a day. \n- It sounds like the engineers in the car take over the driving fairly regularly - maybe every few minutes (this is as of August - it might be less frequent now). Plus, the cars only operate in a limited area in Pittsburgh that Uber have mapped very thoroughly. \n- Also, traffic is likely to move more slowly in the areas where these cars operate, so let's say that they travel around 100 miles a day under autonomous control.\n- Assume an average of around 40 cars on the road between now and the end of December, that's 4,000 miles a day. There's 39 days left in the month, so that's 156,000 miles to be driven between now and the end of the year.\n- Accidents in the US happen somewhere between every 160,000 miles and every 500,000 miles - it's probably more often in a city like Pittsburgh.\n- So let's assume that the cars will drive another 160,000 miles by the end of the year, and accidents happen in Pittsburgh every 160,000 miles.\n- To work out the probability I think we use the Poisson distribution - if my stats haven't failed me, then I think the probability of at least one accident before the end of the year is around 63%.\n- This feels a bit high as I think Uber will be doing a lot to try to avoid having an accident and the associated bad press - e.g. maybe the operators in the car will take over if there's a potential accident, so maybe they will be a lot more likely to be in control at the time of an accident.

Uber would only deploy them if they believed that the cars were approximately as safe as human drivers (so we can estimate using statistics based on human traffic). This is reinforced by the presence of a human driver, prepared to override the system if necessary.\n1. There are going to be 100 vehicles in Uber's autonomous fleet by year's end. We don't know how many cars Uber has or will successfully deliver, but a better assumption is that they're on schedule and delivering linearly, indicating that half of the car*miles in the whole fleet assumption actually get driven.\n2. 1. It seems like Uber drivers in metropolitan areas (like Pittsburgh, home of Uber's autonomous fleet) travel around 100 miles per 8 hr. shift. That said, I don't know how long they're on the road daily--could be as much as 24hr.\n3. If all of them were on the road today, and all of them did 24 hour shifts, then there'd be 100 Cars * 300 miles / car*day * 41 car*days = 1,230,000 car*miles. My best guess is that the actual number is 50 cars * 100 miles / car*day * 41 car*days = 105,000 car*miles to be driven by year's end.\n4. I can't find a great estimate for the ratio of accidents to miles driven, but an adequate one seems to be around 1 accident per 100,000 car*miles. Accordingly, the expected number of accidents is around 1 accident. This probability should degrade approximately linearly.

We are getting into the winter season (now this can go both ways, Uber might shut down the program during snow days, but if they don't I can see more chances of an accident). They've already said that bridges are a problem for them.\n2. They just added another 100 new cars. So we are going from 4 to 104 cars. Which will increase the chance of an accident. There have a been at least 1 incident reported so far.\n3. They seem to have rushed into this for PR reasons and that always means taking shortcuts and higher possibility of error. If this was Google, I'd give them a much lower probability of an accident. That being said, looking at everyone else giving such a low chance to this event happening, it does affect my rating and makes me want to go much lower (there should be a way for people to not see other forecasts as it causes bias).

My view of Uber entering the pilot with passenger (that could always pilot without them) is to generate goodwill, so in view of new accidents, the risk is high that the tide could turn against them, but they could also have a pilot without the passenger, and I think the utilization rate is going to go down.  On the other hand, Uber is pretty entrepreneurial and like to go in a market and make its own rules before the government makes those rules, which in the case in Penn, the two self driving car bills are pending (http://www.ncsl.org/research/transportation/autonomous-vehicles-legislation.aspx).

Edit: The math is wrong again, the 55% reporting rate should not be used to modify mileage, but instead on the chance of crashing.  The total mileage with reporting rate is 108,000 miles, then we plug it like this (1-1/500,000)^108,000, to get around 81% of no crash, the chance of crashing is around 19%,  55% of 19% is around 10% instead, so similar to the earlier result anyways."], [6303, "2016-10-31T01:33:48Z", [0.2], "According to the general news and GJP consensus."], [691, "2016-10-30T17:59:52Z", [0.04], ""], [18771, "2016-10-30T13:47:34Z", [0.02], ""], [29836, "2016-10-30T12:31:58Z", [0.5], ""], [29822, "2016-10-30T11:10:26Z", [0.1], ""], [15471, "2016-10-30T06:41:31Z", [0.15], ""], [29852, "2016-10-29T22:14:13Z", [0.5], ""], [11800, "2016-10-29T20:01:42Z", [0.35], ""], [14208, "2016-10-29T18:43:11Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-10-29T15:05:18Z", [0.04], ""], [23193, "2016-10-29T12:44:16Z", [0.25], ""], [4139, "2016-10-29T05:06:31Z", [0.01], ""], [29828, "2016-10-28T22:00:46Z", [1.0], ""], [29824, "2016-10-28T20:41:01Z", [0.01], ""], [29814, "2016-10-28T19:33:52Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-10-28T15:28:39Z", [0.04], ""], [21800, "2016-10-28T11:57:46Z", [0.1], ""], [691, "2016-10-27T19:18:11Z", [0.04], ""], [29788, "2016-10-27T10:42:04Z", [0.02], "There will only a handful of takers.

You get around 1 crash per 500K Miles. For miles driven by Uber autopilot, I get around 50 cars (Google has about 58 as of Sep 2016), \nhttps://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.g.u.00rz.com/en/us/selfdrivingcar/files/reports/report-0916.pdf Speed is around 25-30MPH, while sometimes go above, let's try 30MPH\nhttps://www.wired.com/2016/09/heres-like-ride-ubers-self-driving-car/ It works from 7am to 10pm, so 15 hours per day\nhttp://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/uber-pittsburgh-robo-taxi-experiment/ There is still about 70 days left until 2017, but if it's not safe to drive for normal cars (say snowing), it will not be on autopilot, so say 50 days I use 50% as utilization rate from a NBER paper, it is comparable to New York and Boston (hours driven, not miles driven)\nhttp://www.nber.org/papers/w22083.pdf Auto mode rate is at around 60%, see the Google paper (62%) and the Digital Trend article (at least 30% manual) earlier.  The same Google paper mentioned that around 55% collisions are not reported, but as can be seen, Google is required to do monthly report (due to state law?), I am not sure if the same applies to Penn, but I will assume honesty from Uber. When you multiply everything together, you get around 337K = 50 cars * 30MPH * 15hr/day * 50 day * utilization rate 50% * autopilot rate 60%.  By dividing 337K/500K, you get around 0.67 crash.  A bit high to be honest, and you can tweak the scenarios (say 30 cars instead of 50, or the national rate could go over 500K, say 650K) to get a lower number, the rate would be down to 0.31 crash if both car and per crash mileage goes up.  Other things to consider is that the driver usually disengages auto before the accident.  On the other hand, the subject is so new that people may under/over estimate, so it pays to be contrarian. Edited: instead of simply do 337K/500K, try the probability equation setting P as the chance of crash, estimate at 1/500,000 miles, so you have not crashing 1-P = 1 - 1/500,000, do this 337,000 times, you get (1-1/500,000)^337,000, this is around 51%, so crash is around 49% instead.

While self driving cars have been shown to more safe than human driven cars, the basic fact is that the more they drive, the more likely they are to be involved in an accident. Rate of accidents:\nThis article: http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/28/nyregion/that-wild-taxi-ride-is-safer-than-you-think-a-study-says.html indicates that the accident rate for black cars is 3.7 per million miles driven in manhattan.  I would imagine that accidents might be less common in Pittsburgh, and while black car drivers are probably generally very good, a self driving car will probably be even more safe since a human driver still has a base level of distraction, so I'll put the rate for Uber's cars at about 1 per million miles driven. Volume of driving:\nI'm not sure how many cars are in the pilot program, I saw something about having 16 self-driving cars somewhere.  This website provides data on the average driving speed in various cities, and while it doesn't include Pittsburgh, similar sized cities average somewhere around 20-30 mph.  I'm going to make a rough estimate that with about 10 cars each driving about 25 hours a week at an average of 20 mph, Uber's self driving cars will be totalling about 5000 miles per week.  Over 10 weeks this adds up to 50,000 miles. My estimate uses a Poisson distribution with an average rate of p = 50,000/1,000,000 = 0.05.  The probability of zero crashes occurring during this period is then 95% (The probability of zero events is roughly (1-p) for small values of p), so the probability of 1 or more is 5% .  There is quite a bit of variance to this estimate.  Doubling or halving the amount of driving or the accident rate will roughly double or half the probability, and there is a a lot of leeway in my guesses.
