What is your current forecast for the total number of registered refugees on 31 December 2016 and how do you get to this number?\nYes you are right, we crossed the planning figure for the registered Syrian in the region and we have different projections scenarios but unfortunately not agreed yet hence are not available for public. New projection will be available somewhere in late November or December this year. cc/ @Anneinak @ulfelder @Raahul_kumar"], [15196, "2016-09-14T07:53:55Z", [0.0, 0.8, 0.2], ""], [436, "2016-09-14T02:35:49Z", [0.25, 0.72, 0.03], "I have a feeling we'll get another \"data dump\" this time and be safely over 5 million -- but I'm taking the crowd's pessimism into account for 5.4.

So what we are asking here is how probable is it that the number of registered refugees increases by about 200,000/between 200,000 and 600,000/more than 600,000? Even more specifically, how probable is it that we see these kind of increases within the last four months of the calendar year? On a purely statistical level, this is easy to answer: Year | Increase over the last four month\n2012 | 298,494\n2013 | 466,960\n2014 | 752,002\n2015 | 507,120 Every single year saw an increase of over 200,000, while only one year saw an increase of over 600,000. This would result in a 0%/75%/25% answer to the question and I take this as my starting assumption. Seasonality and bureaucracy is important in this data series. Note the huge jumps in December of 2014 and 2015. This is clearly not related to actual refugee flows across borders, but to some form of data dump, likely to reconcile the common database at year's end. In this context it is important to note that at the end of 2015, there were about 2 million unregistered Syrian refugees present in the area, so increased registration doesn't necessarily has to correlate with increased flows across borders (http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/download.php?id=9937). But the data also reveals that the number of registered refugees across the region has shrunk for three months in a row including August 2016, the first time it has done so. And the increase in the first 8 months of this year has been by far the lowest compared to 2015, 2014 and 2013. On top of that the number of refugees forecasted by the UNHCR to be present at the end of 2016 was only 4.6 million, which has already been surpassed. I will therefore adapt my forecast to 20%/75%/5% based on my assumption that a jump of >600,000 is highly unlikely, while a stagnation is a reasonable assumption given recent data and developments (there are also clear indications that Turkey and other countries are trying to limit the number of refugees entering their country and official systems).
