Deaths need to be \"named and substantiated\", as described on the ICG page, and this can be especially delayed in the case of PKK casualties. For July, Hurriyet, the Turkist newspaper with the largest circulation, reported about 52 PKK deaths, 5 civilian deaths, and 3 army deaths (based on an archive search).  This is essentially the same as the present (early September) ICG death count for July.  So in general, official sources appear to concord with the ICG counts.  (I really need to go back and compare months before July; add that to the to-do list ...) For August, Hurriyet reported a significant increase in deaths: 11 army, 7 civilian.  PKK casualties were reported as a total of 68 deaths to about the 19th, then the army changed their preferred term to \"neutralised\" (which combines deaths and captures).  106 total PKK deaths and \"neutralisations\" were reported in the Hurriyet for the month ... 106 + 11 + 7 = 124 ... which is _really_ close to the cut off. Anadolu Agency, a government-run news agency, reports 176 PKK deaths \"inside and outside Turkey\" due to \"Turkey security forces' anti-terrorism operations\":\nhttp://aa.com.tr/en/info/infographic/6953 So what to make of the fact that Turkish official news sources (which usually are concordant with the ICG) have been reporting significant increases in PKK deaths for August, but the ICG has not?  Either Turkish sources are inflating death estimates where they have not previously, or else there is a serious lag in the ICG ability to confirm PKK deaths.  I strongly suspect the latter. Just for August, if we trust official data, it is likely that deaths exceeded 125.  It is not a certainty as the number of \"neutralisations\" or \"deaths outside Turkey\" cannot be teased out of the data I have.  Let's call it p= 0.75.  The next question: will the ICG be able to confirm those deaths before 29 December?  For August, I think that that is likely (p= 0.9).  However, in subsequent months it will become more difficult for the ICG to confirm PKK deaths before the end of December. Overall, I think is still highly likely that August will eventually pass the 125 threshold (68%).  Subsequent months are less likely to meet the threshold (reversion to the mean) and, even if they do, the ICG will have more difficulty confirming that fact in a timely manner.

This further restricts the domain of the two actors in conflict interactions: the Turkish state, its officers, police and other officials along with PKK insurgents and its proxies.  Turkey views the PKK as a terror group, while the PKK is engaged in a political and military struggle for independence.  Since the cessation of a relatively short period of conflict and an unsuccessful coup against the state, the two sets of actors have intensified their asymmetric non-zero-sum game of terror and counterterror.  Given this dynamic we should expect the counts to move above the threshold, however, restrictions on the range for counts in 4 groups will be reduced.
