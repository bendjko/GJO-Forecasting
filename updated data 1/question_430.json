South Korean officials believe more provocation from the reclusive state is possible, despite international outrage over Sunday\u2019s test and calls for more sanctions on North Korea. South Korea\u2019s Asia Business Daily, citing an unidentified source, reported on Tuesday that North Korea had been spotted moving a rocket that appeared to be an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) towards its west coast. The rocket started moving on Monday and was spotted moving only at night to avoid surveillance, the report said. South Korea\u2019s defense ministry, which warned on Monday that North Korea was ready to launch an ICBM at any time, said they were unable to confirm the contents of the report (para. 1-4). Moon and Trump agreed on Monday to scrap a warhead weight limit on South Korea\u2019s missiles, South Korea\u2019s presidential office said, enabling it to strike North Korea with greater force in the event of a military conflict. The White House said Trump gave \u201cin-principle approval\u201d to the move (para. 19). \u201cWe believe the unlimited warhead payload will be useful in responding to North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile threats,\u201d Defence Ministry spokesman Moon Sang-gyun told a briefing on Tuesday.

The book has raised my interest in the long history of US misunderstandings about Chinese political dynamics and intentions.  Time and again US players have seen what they want to see in China, and missed the reality.  With the distracting blizzard of Trump tweet commentary, perhaps today's big mistake is to see the North Korea problem as a North Korea problem, when it appears to be a China problem.  China's expansionist strategy has many elements, including claims to the South China Sea, naval base construction in the Indian Ocean, recent border clashes with India and relentless pressure on US affiliates including the Philippines, South Korea and Japan.   If China's strategic goal is to break apart the structure that has controlled the Western Pacific region since the end of WW II, North Korea is simply China's useful dog in this campaign.  China's ideal preferred end game would include:  (1) tractable vassal states in Japan, Philippines, Vietnam that have no alliance with the United States.  (2) restoration of Taiwan and various perimeter island chains as China possessions,  (3) reunification of the Korean peninsula under a socialist or communist political regime that China would dominate, and (4) Chinese control of the Eastern hemisphere to a degree that would be similar to what the Monroe Doctrine once was in the Western Hemisphere.  If this is the great game being played, six party talks would be a farce, and no progress will come from getting in a room one-on-one with Kim.    Since North Korea ICBM capabilities have become an existential threat to the United States, sooner or later there will be war.  If war comes sooner, millions will die in South Korea and Japan.  If it comes later, hundreds of millions will die in US cities.  This sets up choices that involve classic conundrums of justice.

The first, more powerful quake measured magnitude 6.3 and was 10 km deep, the U.S. Geological Survey said, again suggesting a nuclear device. Such a magnitude would be its most powerful detonation yet.

Russel, who served until March as the assistant secretary of state for East Asian affairs. \u201cAll of this is focused on pressuring the U.S. to enter direct talks with Kim on his terms. That is the big trap.\u201d\n. . . \n\"Mr. Trump brings a deal-maker\u2019s swagger to the North Korea issue that his predecessors did not. He has in the past expressed a willingness to sit across a table from the willful young scion of North Korea\u2019s ruling family. \u201cI would speak to him,\u201d Mr. Trump said during the presidential campaign. \u201cI would have no problem speaking to him.\u201d Last April, he said, \u201cIf it would be appropriate for me to meet with him, I would absolutely; I would be honored to do it.\u201d\n. . . \n\"For now, a Trump-Kim summit remains a far-fetched notion. Even if North Korea was interested in speaking to the United States, its string of belligerent actions \u2014 not to mention the June death of Otto F. Warmbier, the Ohio college student held for nearly 18 months in Pyongyang \u2014 would make a meeting politically untenable for Mr. Trump.\n. . . \n\"Other experts said it was not diplomacy itself that was problematic \u2014 particularly if the United States negotiated, along with its allies and China \u2014 but that Mr. Trump, acting alone, could be an unpredictable negotiator. \u201cTrump is not the first president to think he can make a deal with these guys,\u201d said Mr. Auslin. \u201cBill Clinton thought he was the great negotiator. His aides thought if they could get him in a room with Kim Jong-il, they could seal a deal. There\u2019s clearly a sense, because of the capriciousness of Trump and the \u2018Art of the Deal,\u2019 that he could do the same.\u201d \"Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet could be interpreted as a negotiating tactic. But experts said he was not helping his case with his wildly divergent statements about Mr. Kim. Last Tuesday, at a rally in Phoenix, Mr. Trump said, \u201cI respect the fact that I believe he is starting to respect us. I respect that fact very much.\u201d \"Further complicating the administration\u2019s approach is its weak diplomatic bench. It still has not named an assistant secretary for East Asian affairs and no ambassador is in Seoul, although the White House is close to nominating Victor D. Cha, a veteran of the George W. Bush administration and well-regarded North Korea expert at Georgetown University. \"Some experts said they took comfort from the fact that in any summit meeting, the North Koreans would never allow the Americans to determine either the setting or the terms of the negotiation. For a deal maker and showman like Mr. Trump, that would probably be unacceptable. \u201cI suspect that in the end, the president might fall back on his event-planning background,\u201d said Michael J. Green, who served as a top Asia adviser to Mr. Bush. \u201cThis is not a Miss Universe pageant or a pro wrestling match, so that might stop Trump in his tracks.\u201d\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  I do not see Trump being willing to be a part of a 6-party deal because he'd have to share the credit with 5 other parties.

North Korea didn\u2019t test-fire any missiles between October and February, according to a database compiled by the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies. But after that relatively long hiatus, North Korea test-launched 14 missiles in a little more than five months, including two intercontinental ballistic missiles and other shorter-range missiles that demonstrated new capabilities (para.5).

While the United States has maintained an uneasy calm with North Korea for more than six decades and spikes in tensions are not new, recent supercharged rhetoric between the unpredictable U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have heightened the risk of miscalculation that could make that nightmare a reality, they say. On Thursday, North Korea upped the ante by saying it would complete plans by mid-August to fire four intermediate-range missiles over Japan to land near the U.S. Pacific island territory of Guam, after Trump said that any threats by Pyongyang would be \"met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.\" The exchange followed a United Nations resolution tightening sanctions on North Korea after it tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles designed to carry nuclear warheads to the United States. Trump said on Thursday his fire and fury comment was not tough enough. Despite the war of words, for now the U.S. military says there has been no change in its readiness posture in South Korea or elsewhere in Asia.

The key to my prediction is effective Chinese & Russian enforcement of the terms of the agreement and elimination of border smuggling, thereby squeezing the North Korean regime. Whether this will occur is difficult to say since China has not effectively complied with prior sanctions in the past. However, the fact that NK now has a nuclear weapon, currently disregards China's advice to deescalate tensions, and is being threatened by US sanctions for alleged dumping and currency manipulation suggests that this time will be different. If war on the Korean Peninsula should break out, China could be destabilized by thousands of North Koreans fleeing across the border. Similarly, I believe Russia will comply because NK is not a major trading partner and that it wants to eventually have the US remove its sanctions on Russia. Russia cooperation would bolster its claim that it is a responsible world player. Leaving oil imports and overseas North Koreans untouched allows the UN to threaten further sanctions. I believe that NK will begin to feel the economic impact in 1-2 months which may lead it to enter negotiations in late Sept. The fact the UN imposed sanctions makes it very likely that any diplomatic solution will involve multiple parties (i.e. 6-party talks). I believe the chances for effective Chinese & Russian cooperation is around 50%. The chance that NK will feel the economic pinch and begin negotiating in the next 7 weeks are much lower (10%). NK has demonstrated willingness to let its people starve and die rather than be viewed as giving up. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/07/world/asia/north-korea-responds-sanctions-united-states.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&_r=0"], [36805, "2017-08-08T07:47:20Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-08-08T06:00:07Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-08-07T20:15:35Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-08-07T04:19:36Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-08-07T04:00:37Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-08-06T18:03:45Z", [0.0], ""], [36780, "2017-08-06T15:11:35Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-08-06T08:55:33Z", [0.0], "United Nations bans key North Korea exports over missile tests Nichols (2017) Aug 5, states that: The United Nations Security Council unanimously imposed new sanctions on North Korea on Saturday that could slash by a third the Asian state's $3 billion annual export revenue over its two intercontinental ballistic missile tests in July.

U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley held an intelligence briefing for her council colleagues on Monday to argue that Pyongyang fired an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), diplomats said, which was attended by Russia and North Korean ally China. U.N. diplomats said Russia had suggested that Russian and U.S. military experts exchange information on the launch. The U.S. briefing came after Russia sent a brief letter and diagram on July 8 to the 15-member Security Council, seen by Reuters, asserting that its radars determined that the missile launched by Pyongyang on July 4 was medium-range. Russia's contention that North Korea did not fire an ICBM hinders Washington's push for the Security Council to impose stronger sanctions on North Korea. The United States, Russia, China, Britain and France are veto-wielding council members. Typically, the council has condemned medium-range ballistic missiles launches by North Korea with a statement. Diplomats say China and Russia only view a long-range missile test or nuclear weapon test as a trigger for further possible U.N. sanctions (para. 1-6). Nichols, M. (2017).

He singled out China for \u201cnew pressure,\u201d pointing out that it has unique economic leverage in accounting for 90 percent of North Korea\u2019s trade. He bluntly declared the U.S. willingness to defend the United States and its allies with military action if necessary. In a warning that Beijing itself has used for others, Washington \u201ccannot idly stand by.\u201d If China fails to accept responsibility for North Korea, then it bears blame for the rising risk of conflict. It is in China\u2019s interest to stop North Korea before the United States and its allies are forced to act in defense. China\u2019s leadership still needs to correct past assumptions. On April 30, the authoritative People\u2019s Daily published an important commentary with the byline of \u201cZhong Sheng\u201d (a homophone for \u201cCenter\u2019s Voice\u201d). While agreeing that the \u201cKorean peninsula needs responsible action,\u201d the view deflected China\u2019s responsibility to the DPRK as well as the United States and ROK. It falsely claimed that China does not have \u201cthe key\u201d to stopping North Korea\u2019s threats and repeated the call for \u201cdual suspensions.\u201d China\u2019s opinions are not convincing or reasonable. The United States and ROK promptly rejected the PRC\u2019s \u201cdual suspension\u201d proposal as basically \u201cdead on arrival\u201d and continued their Foal Eagle military exercises. Even North Korea rejected China\u2019s call and vowed to continue nuclear tests. China has posed no serious pressure to stop North Korea and ignored the resolutions of the UNSC though Beijing is a permanent member and has coercive power. Other countries can see China\u2019s proposal as an attempt to deflect blame in this crisis (para. 1-7). Kan, S. (2017). China Should Stop Deflecting on North Korea. Foreign Policy. Six Party Talks. Retrieved from\nhttp://thediplomat.com/2017/05/china-should-stop-deflecting-on-north-korea/ Six Party Talks on North Korea's Nuclear Program Lu (2016) March 12, states that: Introduction The Six Party Talks were launched in 2003 to deal with North Korea's nuclear program. The main goal of the talks was to get the DPRK to disarm and fully end its nuclear arms development program. [1] The countries participating in these talks include China, Japan, South Korea, North Korea, Russia and the United States. Fig. 1 shows the seating configuration of the talks, with each state strategically placed around the table. The commencement of the talks marked the end of America's non-engagement policy with the DPRK. In 2005, a milestone was made when North Korea agreed to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. [1] However, although there have already been several rounds of talks since 2003, they have so far failed to make progress because of North Korea's frequent missile tests and threats. Although North Korea was included in the original talks, the state walked out of the 2009 negotiations and it was discovered a year later by the United States that the DPRK had been hiding a new uranium enrichment facility. [1] In 2012, shortly after the death of Kim Jong-Il, his successor, Kim Jong-Un announced that he'd be willing to reconsider restarting the Six Party talks. [2] Although North Korea appeared to be making efforts to stall its nuclear program by announcing it would suspend nuclear tests and agree to international monitoring in exchange for American food and resource aid. However, the talks were never reconvened as a few months later in 2012, the DPRK launched a long-range missile and tested another in 2013. [2] Many of the Six Party countries have voiced their desire for the talks to resume, especially China, which sent a special envoy to the DPRK in late September 2013 urging them to reconsider an informal meeting with the rest of the Six Party nations (para. 1-2).

Sure, I've given it only 2% but sometimes it's about the psychology about foregone conclusions and how a mind shift, even of a minority, precedes realization or manifestation. This isn't really a prediction board if the questions are ones where the likelihood of an event occurring is 0% or 100% within a given time frame.  What I mean is that there should be some uncertainty such that one would not predict with absolute certainty.  That said, I believe there is some likelihood that six-party talks resume given that North Korea has refrained more recently from launching any more rockets or test detonated a nuclear device. The question may be whether the six-party talks are preceded by something on a more limited scale such as three-party talks prior to a larger discussion and how long that process takes.  Also, the context is rooted in the end of WWII and the Korean Conflict, the lack of final resolution of peace between parties.  And again, the balance of power with an economically ascendant China and the function of war and the threat of war.  Sometimes it seems like what appears as quietude is a buildup and harbinger of war and that preparation for war is actually a prelude to peace.

Under third-generation leader Kim Jong Un, North Korea has been conducting missile tests at an unprecedented pace in an effort to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of hitting the mainland United States. Compared to the different types of ballistic missiles Pyongyang has recently tested, the missiles launched on Thursday are considered to be more defensive in nature, designed to defend against threats such as enemy warships.

Mattis labeled North Korea and its efforts to attain intercontinental nuclear missiles a \"clear and present danger.\" The defense chief also blasted the Chinese for militarizing artificial islands in the South China Sea, a region that has been an increasing source of friction between the United States, its allies and China. Last month at a NATO meeting in Brussels, President Trump did not explicitly endorse Article 5 of the NATO treaty that asserts that an attack on one member nation is an attack on all. But Mattis implied Trump's appearance at the NATO summit amounted to such an endorsement. \"The fact that President Trump went to Brussels, he speaks with word of actions, too,\" Mattis said. \"He was there to show our statement that we are standing with the NATO allies 100%.\" Mattis made his remarks at an international security conference in Singapore, part of his swing through the region that includes a visit to Australia. In his talk, Mattis said the United States has been encouraged by China's willingness to pressure North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons program. But on Friday, China blocked tough new sanctions against North Korea that the United States pushed in the U.N. Security Council, the Associated Press reported. The Security Council, however, did vote unanimously to add 15 individuals and four entities linked to the North\u2019s nuclear and missile programs to a U.N. sanctions blacklist. Mattis tempered his hopes for Chinese help with North Korea with a rebuke of its ambitions in the South China Sea. China has increasingly asserted sovereignty over large parts of those waters. The Chinese military has been constructing artificial islands in the resource-rich region atop reefs, paving landing strips and fortifying them. China is also jostling over islands that Japan claims in the East China Sea.

The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system battery was initially deployed in March in the southeastern region of Seongju with just two of its maximum load of six launchers to counter a growing North Korean missile threat. During his successful campaign for the May 9 presidential election, Moon called for a parliamentary review of the system, whose deployment has also infuriated China, North Korea's lone major ally. \"President Moon said it was very shocking\" to hear the four additional launchers had been installed without being reported to the new government or to the public, presidential spokesman Yoon Young-chan told a media briefing.

Security Council response - such as sanctions - to North Korea's repeated ballistic missile launches, which the 15-member body normally condemns in a statement, diplomats said. It was not immediately clear how open Beijing might be to new sanctions. The council has traditionally boosted sanctions in response to North Korea's five nuclear tests and two long-range rocket launches. Sanctions were first imposed on Pyongyang in 2006. North Korea has in the past year stepped up its missile tests, firing dozens of various types of rockets, according to South Korea. The most recent test, which failed, came on Friday following a U.N. Security Council meeting on North Korea, chaired by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. \"The cumulative actions of the DPRK (North Korea) since their last nuclear test compel us to look at a range of measures that would apply pressure,\" said a spokesman for the U.S. Permanent Mission to the United Nations on Tuesday. \"As Secretary Tillerson said on Friday, business as usual is not an option. We are exploring options for a response to this series of provocations with our Security Council colleagues,\" the spokesman said. Tillerson on Friday urged the Security Council to act before North Korea does. The Trump administration has been aggressively pressing Beijing to rein in its ally and neighbor North Korea, warning that all options were on the table if Pyongyang persists with its nuclear and missile development. But China has said military threats would not help the situation and has accused the United States of fueling tensions on the Korean Peninsula. Beijing on Tuesday reiterated its opposition to the deployment of the U.S.' THAAD anti-missile defense system in South Korea and urged it to be halted immediately. The last round of complex sanctions imposed by the Security Council took three months to negotiate following Pyongyang's fifth nuclear test in September. Those measures aimed to cut North Korea's annual export revenue by a quarter. Traditionally, the United States and China have negotiated new sanctions before involving remaining council members. U.N. diplomats said the current talks were still just between the pair (para. 1-11). Nichols, M. (2017). U.S., China talk firmer U.N. response to North Korea's missiles: diplomats. Reuters.

The two supersonic B-1B Lancer bombers were deployed amid rising tensions over North Korea's pursuit of its nuclear and missile programme in defiance of U.N. sanctions and pressure from the United States. The flight of the two bombers on Monday came as U.S. President Donald Trump said he would be \"honored\" to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in the right circumstances, and as his CIA director landed in South Korea for talks. South Korean Defence Ministry spokesman Moon Sang-gyun told a briefing in Seoul that Monday's joint drill was conducted to deter provocations by the North. North Korea said the bombers conducted \"a nuclear bomb dropping drill against major objects\" in its territory at a time when Trump and \"other U.S. warmongers are crying out for making a preemptive nuclear strike\" on the North. \"The reckless military provocation is pushing the situation on the Korean peninsula closer to the brink of nuclear war,\" the North's official KCNA news agency said on Tuesday. Tensions on the Korean peninsula have been high for weeks, driven by concerns that the North might conduct its sixth nuclear test in defiance of pressure from the United States and Pyongyang's sole major ally, China.

All 100 senators have been asked to the White House for the briefing by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said White House spokesman Sean Spicer on Monday. While administration officials routinely travel to Capitol Hill to address members of Congress on foreign policy matters, it is unusual for the entire Senate to go to the White House, and for all four of those officials to be involved. Wednesday's briefing was originally scheduled for a secure room at the Capitol, but President Donald Trump suggested a shift to the White House, congressional aides said. Washington has expressed mounting concern over North Korea's nuclear and missile tests, and its threats to attack the United States and its Asian allies. Trump, who called the leaders of China and Japan during the weekend, told U.N. Security Council ambassadors on Monday that \"the status quo\" is not acceptable, and said the council must be ready to impose new sanctions (para. 1-6). Zengerle, P. (2017).

The missile flew about 60 km (40 miles) from its launch site at Sinpo, a port city on the North's east coast, the South Korea's Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement. Sinpo is home to a North Korean submarine base. The launch comes just a day before the start of a summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping, where talks about adding pressure on the North to drop its arms development will take center stage. \"The launch took place possibly in consideration of the U.S. -China summit, while at the same time it was to check its missile capability,\" a South Korean official told Reuters about the military's initial assessment of the launch. The missile was fired at a high angle and reached an altitude of 189 km (117 miles), the official added. Any launch of objects using ballistic missile technology is a violation of U.N.

This includes developing a \"pre-emptive first strike capability\" and an inter-continental ballistic missile (ICBM), said Choe Myong Nam, deputy ambassador at the North Korean mission to the United Nations in Geneva. Reuters, quoting a senior U.S. official in Washington, reported on Monday that the Trump administration is considering sweeping sanctions as part of a broad review of measures to counter North Korea's nuclear and missile threat. (For Monday's story, click reut.rs/2n9HZ5a) \"I think this is stemming from the visit by the Secretary of State (Rex Tillerson) to Japan, South Korea and China...We of course are not afraid of any act like that,\" Choe told Reuters. \"Even prohibition of the international transactions system, the global financial system, this kind of thing is part of their system that will not frighten us or make any difference.\" He called existing sanctions \"heinous and inhumane\". North Korea has been under sanctions for \"half a century\" but the communist state survives by placing an emphasis on juche or \"self-sufficiency\", he said. His country wants a forum set up to examine the \"legality and legitimacy of the sanctions regime\". He denounced joint annual military exercises currently being carried out by the United States and South Korea on the divided peninsula and criticized remarks by Tillerson during his talks with regional allies last week. \"All he was talking about is for the United States to take military actions on DPRK,\" Choe said, using the acronym for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. North Korea rejects claims by Washington and Seoul that the military drills are defensive. They involve strategic nuclear bombers and a nuclear submarine, Columbus, that recently entered South Korean ports, he said. \"In the light of such huge military forces involved in the joint military exercises, we have no other choice but to continue with our full acceleration of the nuclear programs and missile programs.
