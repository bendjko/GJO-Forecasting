The manufacturers were the defendants in lower court and are the petitioner in Supreme Court. District court ruled in favor of the manufacturers on both counts of strict liability and negligence. The widow appealed. The Appellate court remanded on the negligence, asking the district court to clarify their decision: was it a bright line rule (meaning in no case a manufacturer would be liable for other parts of a product that were made by someone else, or added on later), or was it case-specific. The district court said it was a bright line ruling. The circuit (appellate) court said the district court was wrong: the manufacturers could have warned about the harmful component (asbestos) in its operating and maintenance manuals. They knew about the danger, and they knew that asbestos would have to be used even though when they shipped the product (in parts to be assembled), asbestos was not present. My heart (and am sure the Justices' hearts as well) goes out to the sailors and their widows. They clearly were wronged here. They signed up to serve in the Navy and accepted the risk associating with combat and operating a ship at sea is a dangerous job. But I am sure they didn't sign up (or drafted) intoexposing themselves to carcinogens. They were wronged, but who will compensate for them?  The most natural entity responsible is the Navy: the Navy ordered them to do the maintenance of the ship; the Navy knew about danger of asbestos; the Navy is the one who could have warned the sailors of the danger, because they knew about it, and could have trained the sailor to have safer handling of the material; the Navy specified asbestos parts, purchased it from asbestos makers. But... the Navy couldn't be sued for negligence or liability. They do give compensation, but very little, according to the widows.  The asbestos part makers and asbestos miners denied responsibility. They said that if the part is intact, there is no problem. Sitting on a shelf, asbestos is not dangerous. It is when subject to heat and pressure, and when the product broke apart (during installation or removal) that small bits of it can get into the lungs and cause lung cancer. Plus, the asbestos part makers or miners are dirt poor, many of them are already bankrupt. No money there to be sued. The manufacturers of machines said they didn't sell to the navy a product that has asbestos in it. The Navy could have put something else (a safer product as they do now) in, or they could put in worse product, it is not up to the machinery manufacturers to warn the endusers (the sailors) about danger of products they didn't sell. That's the bare-metal defense.  So, the only thing that went in favor of the widows is that the Appellate court said the machinery manufacturers could have warned about danger of asbestos since they knew the Navy will use asbestos parts to complete the installation. And it ruled so based on the Maritime Law precedence, not bright line Tort law, so that it may not need to apply to other products. For instance, manufacturers of flashlights may not need to warn about exploding batteries (unless by operating the or installing the batteries, there is a chance the flashlight would damage the batteries, rendering it an explosion hazard, then they would have to warn the consumers).  Reading the questions from the Justices, I am not so sure they even agree that the machinery manufacturers would have to post a warning on the machines. or in their operating manuals on the danger of asbestos or put it in their maintenance manuals of how to handle the material.
