Future it does not alter defective genes it alters normal genes to increase their effectivity in combating cancer, confirmed by two oncologist and multiple research data references. \nNeergraard (2017) Aug 30, states that: Opening a new era in cancer care, U.S. health officials on Wednesday approved a breakthrough treatment that genetically engineers\u2019 patients' own blood cells into an army of assassins to seek and destroy childhood leukemia. The Food and Drug Administration called the approval historic, the first gene therapy to hit the U.S. market. Made from scratch for every patient, it's one of a wave of \"living drugs\" under development to fight additional blood cancers and other tumors, too. Novartis Pharmaceuticals set the price for its one-time infusion of so-called \"CAR-T cells\" at $475,000, but said there would be no charge for patients who didn't show a response within a month. \"This is a brand-new way of treating cancer,\" said Dr. Stephan Grupp of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, who treated the first child with CAR-T cell therapy \u2014 a girl who'd been near death but now is cancer-free for five years and counting. \"That's enormously exciting.\" CAR-T treatment uses gene therapy techniques (not to fix disease-causing genes) but to [turbocharge T cells, immune system soldiers] that cancer too often can evade. Researchers filter those cells from a patient's blood, reprogram them to harbor a \"chimeric antigen receptor\" or CAR that zeroes in on cancer, and grow hundreds of millions of copies. Returned to the patient, the revved-up cells can continue multiplying to fight disease for months or years. It's a completely different way to harness the immune system than popular immunotherapy drugs called \"checkpoint inhibitors\" that treat a variety of cancers by helping the body's natural T cells better spot tumors. CAR-T cell therapy gives patients stronger T cells to do that job (para 1-6). Neergraard, L. (2017). US clears breakthrough gene therapy for childhood leukemia. Associated Press.

The OHSU research is believed to have broken new ground both in the number of embryos experimented upon and by demonstrating it is possible to safely and efficiently correct defective genes that cause inherited diseases, according to Technology Review, which first reported the news. None of the embryos were allowed to develop for more than a few days, according to the report. Some countries have signed a convention prohibiting the practice on concerns it could be used to create so-called designer babies. Results of the peer-reviewed study are expected to be published soon in a scientific journal, according to OHSU spokesman Eric Robinson. The research, led by Shoukhrat Mitalipov, head of OHSU's Center for Embryonic Cell and Gene Therapy, involves a technology known as CRISPR that has opened up new frontiers in genetic medicine because of its ability to modify genes quickly and efficiently.

The relatively easy technique for cutting and pasting genes has exploded onto the scientific scene, and over the past years there's been no shortage of spectacular results delivered thanks to this amazing tool. Just this year alone, researchers have made advances in fighting diseases, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, mosquitoes and much more. 1. For the first time, scientists have used gene editing to successfully remove HIV from a living organism, and they did this in three different animal models. Using CRISPR, the team got rid of the virus DNA and cleared up both acute and latent infections. 2. The first ever semi-synthetic organisms have been developed by breeding E. coli bacteria with an unusual six-letter genetic code instead of the typical one with just four bases. The researchers used gene editing to make sure bacteria would not register the new DNA molecules as invaders. 3. CRISPR has been used to successfully target the 'command centre' of cancer - the hybrid fusion genes that often trigger abnormal tumour growths. By cutting and pasting, researchers created a cancer-busting gene that actually shrunk tumours in mice carrying human prostate and liver cancer cells. 4. With the help of CRISPR, scientists also recently managed to slow the growth of cancer cells. They targeted a protein called Tudor-SN that helps cell division, and think this technique could help inhibit fast-growing cancer cells. 5. Gene editing has been used to make viruses force superbugs to kill themselves. By arming bacteriophage viruses with genetic sequences that contain antibiotic resistance genes, researchers have been able to trigger self-destructing mechanisms in bacteria that naturally try to protect themselves from phages. 6. Mosquito-borne diseases could become a thing of the past thanks to gene editing. Scientists have found a new way to limit the spread of mosquitoes by hacking their fertility genes, and they attribute the success to the efficient way CRISPR can make several genetic code changes at once 7. Researchers have managed to edit out Huntington's disease genes in mice, efficiently reversing signs of the fatal condition. It's entirely likely that this brilliant technique could one day be used on humans as well, after demonstrating this promising first step. 8. Apart from medical breakthroughs, CRISPR could also give us the gift of more abundant, sustainable biofuels. Scientists recently used a combination of gene editing tools to engineer algae that produce twice as much biofuel material as their wild counterparts. 9. If you've watched the first-ever movie encoded in DNA code, you have CRISPR to thank for this advance, too. Just recently, scientists finally managed to turn cells into a 'molecular recorder' as they used gene editing to embed sequences of information into the genome of E. coli. As all amazing technology, CRISPR has also sparked concerns, especially as we're getting ever-so closer to routinely using it in humans. But scientists have also discovered an 'off switch' for the process, which allows to stop the mechanism in its tracks (para. 1-12). Dean, S.

If approved by the FDA, the agency would consider it the first gene therapy to hit the market. The drug may provide a second chance to some leukemia patients whose first-line drugs have failed. A panel of experts voted to endorse the immunotherapy drug, known as tisagenlecleucel, which treats a type of leukemia that is more common among children. Ten committee members voted in favor, and one left early without voting. None voted against. The drug enables patients' own immune cells to recognize and kill the source of the cancer: a different immune cell gone awry. \"Which one wins is really the question of life or death,\" said Dr. Catherine Diefenbach, clinical director of lymphoma at the NYU Perlmutter Cancer Center. Diefenbach, who was not involved in researching the drug and has no ties to its manufacturer, Novartis, described its results as \"astounding.\" The research presented to the committee studied the drug as a treatment for the relapse of a blood cancer known as B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or ALL. This is the most common type of cancer among children, according to the National Cancer Institute (para. 1-6). But the drug has side effects that can be fatal, such as cytokine release syndrome or CRS, which \"looks like sepsis\" and causes blood pressure to drop dangerously low, said Diefenbach. This could limit the drug's availability to those hospitals that are specially equipped to deal with this complication, she added (para. 10). Tisagenlecleucel is a type of immunotherapy called chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, or CAR-T (para 16). CAR-T drugs like tisagenlecleucel are made by removing immune cells from a patient, genetically modifying them using a virus and putting them back into the patient. The virus creates a new cell receptor -- which is, in Novartis' case, part mouse -- that targets another receptor on the cancer cells: CD19. This modification of the cells causes them to attack the cancer cells. By modifying immune cell DNA, this method could, in theory, lead to other cancers -- a longtime concern for gene therapy. But researchers have found no cases of this happening with the CAR-T treatment so far. Brody said it could take decades to conclusively say this does not happen. \"We've never seen this theoretical thing,\" Brody said, arguing that the chance of any adverse event happening is certainly smaller than the certain death of relapsed cancer. \"It's not an opinion. This is straightforward numbers.\" Brody said personalized immunotherapy treatments like this one require that patients use their own immune cells because they would \"almost never (find) a match\" in an off-the-shelf product (para 16-20). The Novartis drug would not be the only FDA-approved drug to target CD19; Amgen's blinatumomab treats ALL using this target, but \"it's overall not quite as good\" as the data coming out of the Novartis trials, Brody said (para. 24). Novartis refers to the drug as immunotherapy, not gene therapy. The FDA, however, would classify it as gene therapy (para 26). The FDA does not have to follow the recommendation of their advisory committees, although it often does. The agency declined to comment on when it would issue a final decision on the committee's recommendation. Novartis expects the FDA to make a final decision by October but declined to comment on the drug's potential price tag (para. 26-27). Emanuel, D. (2017).

The process entails harvesting millions of T-cells from the patient, infecting them with a modified form of the HIV virus to modifying their DNR to attach B cells, then returning them back to the patient. Of importance, this recommendation was issued with the support of 100% of the AdCom members A study from McKinsey & Co. showed that the final FDA approval rate after an advisory comm. recommendation to approve was 88% through 2010. However, according to Avalere, from 2010-2015, the approval rate dropped to approx 75%. But a closer look reveals that the final approval rate for cancer drugs is lower, approaching 64%.  In addition, based on McKinsey's report, for drugs with >67% AdCom support to approve, the average time until final approval, up until 2010, was 140 days, or approx. 4.5 months (mid-November). Despite a recommendation for approval, the AdCom voiced several concerns. This gene therapy modifies the T cells to permanently attack B cells - even healthy ones. As a result, patient will require regular infusions of immune globulins to suppress the immune system afterwards. This may result in short term cures/remissions, but create new auto-immune diseases in the long-term - these may include lupus or lupus-like reactions, organ failures, and chronic inflammatory conditions, and also increase the risk of infectious diseases.  Patients will need to be monitored for at least 15 years. Experts are also still unclear which patients would most benefit from this treatment vs. traditional chemotherapy and bone-marrow transplantation. Now that the AdCom has recommended approval, using 64% as the baseline, adjusting possible FDA concerns about potential life-threatening long-term risks, the fact that this is a new - and potentially permanent - technique, and that the deadline for this question is 10/1/17 vs. a predicted mid-November day, I have now upgraded my prediction. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/12/health/fda-novartis-leukemia-gene-medicine.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news\nhttp://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/dotcom/client_service/%20Public%20Sector/Regulatory%20excellence/FDA_advisory_committee_outcomes.ashx\nhttp://avalere.com/expertise/life-sciences/insights/new-study-analyzes-fda-advisory-committees-trends-in-first-three-years-of-c"], [22300, "2017-07-13T13:12:59Z", [0.95], ""], [11057, "2017-07-13T13:08:40Z", [0.45], "I'm starting with a higher probability of FDA approval given that Kite Pharma has proceeded with a rolling submission which, if I understand correctly, falls within FDA's Fast Track process (https://www.fda.gov/forpatients/approvals/fast/ucm405399.htm, https://obroncology.com/article/car-t-cell-therapy-on-fast-track-for-commercialization-in-2017/).\n\"Based on these findings, Kite Pharma initiated a rolling FDA submission for KTE-C19 as a treatment for relapsed/refractory aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma in patients who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant.

The panel recommended approving the treatment for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia that has resisted treatment, or relapsed, in children and young adults aged 3 to 25. \u201cWe believe that when this treatment is approved it will save thousands of children\u2019s lives around the world,\u201d Emily\u2019s father, Tom Whitehead, told the panel. \u201cI hope that someday all of you on the advisory committee can tell your families for generations that you were part of the process that ended the use of toxic treatments like chemotherapy and radiation as standard treatment, and turned blood cancers into a treatable disease that even after relapse most people survive.\u201d \"The main evidence that Novartis presented to the F.D.A. came from a study of 63 patients who received the treatment from April 2015 to August 2016. Fifty-two of them, or 82.5 percent, went into remission \u2014 a high rate for such a severe disease. Eleven others died. \u201cIt\u2019s a new world, an exciting therapy,\u201d said Dr. Gwen Nichols, the chief medical officer of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, which paid for some of the research that led to the treatment. The next step, she said, will be to determine \u201cwhat we can combine it with and is there a way to use it in the future to treat patients with less disease, so that the immune system is in better shape and really able to fight.\u201d She added, \u201cThis is the beginning of something big.\u201d At the meeting, the panel of experts did not question the lifesaving potential of the treatment in hopeless cases. But they raised concerns about potentially life-threatening side effects \u2014 short-term worries about acute reactions like those Emily experienced, and longer-term worries about whether the infused cells could, years later, cause secondary cancers or other problems. Oncologists have learned how to treat the acute reactions, and so far, no long-term problems have been detected, but not enough time has passed to rule them out.  Patients who receive the treatment will be entered in a registry and tracked for 15 years. Treatments involving live cells, known as \u201cbiologics\u201d are generally far more difficult to manufacture than standard drugs, and the panelists also expressed concerns about whether Novartis would be able to produce consistent treatments and maintain quality control as it scaled up its operation. Another parent at the meeting, Don McMahon, described his son Connor\u2019s grueling 12 years with severe and relapsing leukemia, which started when he was 3. Mr. McMahon displayed painful photographs of Connor, bald and intubated during treatment. And he added that chemotherapy had left his son infertile. A year ago, the family was preparing for a bone marrow transplant when they learned about the cell treatment, which Connor then underwent at Duke University. He has since returned to playing hockey. Compared with standard treatment, which required dozens of spinal taps and painful bone marrow tests, the T-cell treatment was far easier to tolerate, Mr. McMahon said, and he urged the panel to vote for approval.\n. . . \nUse will not be widespread at first because the disease is not common. It affects only 5,000 people a year, about 60 percent of them children and young adults. Most children are cured with standard treatments, but in 15 percent of cases \u2014 like Emily\u2019s and Connor\u2019s \u2014 the disease does not respond, or it relapses. Analysts predict that these individualized treatments could cost more than $300,000, but a spokeswoman for Novartis, Julie Masow, declined to specify a price. Although the figure may seem high, people with cancer often endure years of expensive treatment and repeat hospital stays that can ultimately cost even more. Because the treatment is complex and patients need expert care to manage the side effects, Novartis will initially limit its use to 30 or 35 medical centers where employees will be trained and approved to administer it, the company said.\n. . . \nBy late November 2016, 11 of the 52 patients in the study who went into remission relapsed. Twenty-nine were still in remission. Eleven others had further treatments, like bone marrow transplants. One patient was not available for assessment. Three who had relapses died, and one who did not relapse died from a new treatment given during remission. The median duration of remission is not known because it has not been reached: Some patients were still well when last checked. Researchers are still debating about which patients can safely forgo further treatment, and which might need a bone marrow treatment to give the best chance of a cure. The treatment requires removing millions of a patient\u2019s T-cells \u2014 a type of white blood cell often called soldiers of the immune system \u2014 and genetically engineering them to kill cancer cells. The technique employs a disabled form of H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, to carry new genetic material into the T-cells to reprogram them. The process turbocharges the T-cells to attack B-cells, a normal part of the immune system that turn malignant in leukemia. The T-cells home in on a protein called CD-19 that is found on the surface of most B-cells.  The altered T-cells are then dripped back into the patient\u2019s veins, where they multiply and start fighting the cancer. Dr. Carl H. June, a leader of the University of Pennsylvania team that developed the treatment, calls the turbocharged cells \u201cserial killers.\u201d A single one can destroy up to 100,000 cancer cells. Because the treatment destroys not only leukemic B-cells but also healthy ones, which help fight germs, patients need treatment to protect them from infection. So every few months they receive infusions of immune globulins. In studies, the process of re-engineering T-cells for treatment sometimes took four months, and some patients were so sick that they died before their cells came back. At the meeting, Novartis said the turnaround time was now down to 22 days. The company also described bar-coding and other procedures used to keep from mixing up samples once the treatment is conducted on a bigger scale."], [4634, "2017-07-13T05:42:23Z", [0.25], ""], [20156, "2017-07-13T05:00:39Z", [0.3], "I raised my prediction because of this: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/12/health/fda-novartis-leukemia-gene-medicine.html"], [28414, "2017-07-13T01:40:19Z", [0.35], ""], [1034, "2017-07-13T00:12:51Z", [0.2], "F.D.A.

According to the website- \"We anticipate completing the Biologics Licensing Application (BLA) submission to the U.S. FDA in early 2017.\" This is an important sentence to keep in mind while considering the date mentioned in the above question. After the application is submitted, the FDA has a 60 day filling period after which it acts on 90% of the applications by 10 months max. For priority drugs it has to make a call in 6 months max. So, the maximum range for approval is around 8 to 12 months. If the BLA is submitted in January and if there are no problems with the application, then the treatment could get approved by September or next year. But this depends on when the application is formally submitted. The website gives no indication regarding this. Further, gene therapy isn't like any other drug. It's new and therefore, high amount of scrutiny before approval is expected.These could eventually lead to delays.\nAs, for other other factors that might affect it's approval, I don't think Trump will be one.
