Because of the urgency\nof this issue and the need to allow the Supreme Court to consider it, I write the\ndissent/concurrence in condensed fashion. It does not reflect the extent to which I disagree with\nthe majority opinion, although I respect it.\n I commend the Secretary for issuing a new confirmation notice form during the pendency\nof this litigation. In all aspects of the law, except for directions on how the voter can continue\nhis registration, it complies with the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA) and the\nHelp America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA).\nBoth sides agree that the language of the NVRA is unambiguous. \u201cIf the words of the\nstatute are unambiguous, the judicial inquiry is at an end, and the plain meaning of the text must\nbe enforced.\u201d United States v. Plavcak, 411 F.3d 655, 661 (6th Cir. 2005) (quoting Hudson v.\nReno, 130 F.3d 1193, 1196 (6th Cir. 1997)).\nThis seems to be a much simpler process than as outlined in the majority opinion. The\nSecretary has established a Supplemental Process for purging voters from the voting rolls in\nOhio. The key language in the statute attacked by the plaintiffs is from 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 20507(b)(2),\nwhich directs that States shall not remove \u201cthe name of any person from the official list of voters\nregistered to vote in an election for Federal office by reason of the person\u2019s failure to vote.\u201d\nHowever, that same subsection allows a State to use \u201cthe procedures described in subsections\n(c) and (d) to remove an individual from the official list of eligible voters\u201d under certain\ncircumstances. Id. That subsection indicates that if the voter\n(A) has not either notified the applicable registrar (in person or in writing) or responded\nduring the period described in subparagraph (B) to the notice sent by the applicable\nregistrar; and then\n(B) has not voted or appeared to vote in 2 or more consecutive general elections for\nFederal office,\n Case: 16-3746 Document: 39-2 Filed: 09/23/2016 Page: 22\nNo. 16-3746 A. Philip Randolph Inst., et al. v. Husted Page 23\nthen subsection (d) provides how States may cancel registrations of those who may have changed\naddresses. Id. It provides that the registrant should not be removed from the list of voters unless\nhe or she confirms that he or she has changed residence or has failed to respond to a notice\ndescribed in paragraph (2) and has not voted during a certain period of time. 52 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 20507(d)(1).\nThe part of the statute which is in contention is \u00a7 20507(b)(2), which indicates that the\nState shall not remove the voter \u201cby reason of the person\u2019s failure to vote.\u201d The Secretary\nindicates that the person is not removed from the voting rolls until after the registrant is sent a\nnotice by mail to find out if he or she still lives at the old address. Not until that person fails to\nrespond, as plaintiff Larry Harmon did, does the State then list the voter as \u201cinactive\u201d in the\nregistration database. Nevertheless, this \u201cinactive\u201d voter has all the rights to cast a regular ballot\nat any election, but if four years transpire without the registrant\u2019s voting, his or her registration\nrecord is canceled. However, if the registrant has any voting activity during those four years, he\nor she returns to an active voter status.\n The text of the NVRA directs the States to \u201cconduct a general program that makes a\nreasonable effort to remove the names of ineligible voters from the official lists of eligible voters\nby reason of\u201d death or relocation. 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 20507(a)(4). The district court found the\nSecretary has made a reasonable effort to carry out that mandate, and I agree. The State cannot\nremove the registrant\u2019s name from the rolls for a failure to vote only, and Ohio does not do so. It\nremoves registrants only if (1) they have not voted or updated their registration for the last two\nyears, (2) also failed to respond to the address-confirmation notice, and (3) then failed to engage\nin any voter activity in four consecutive years, including two consecutive Federal elections\nfollowing that notice.\n The decision of the district court also follows the language in HAVA. The district court\ncited the following language from that act:\n[C]onsistent with the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 . . . , registrants\nwho have not responded to a notice and who have not voted in 2 consecutive\ngeneral elections for Federal office shall be removed from the official list of\neligible voters, except that no registrant may be removed solely by reason of a\nfailure to vote.\n Case: 16-3746 Document: 39-2 Filed: 09/23/2016 Page: 23\nNo. 16-3746 A. Philip Randolph Inst., et al. v. Husted Page 24\n52 U.S.C. \u00a7 21083(a)(4). As the Secretary has explained, it is his position that no voter is\nremoved solely by reason of a failure to vote, and thus he has complied with the language from\nboth statutes. I agree. The statutes leave it to the States to implement, and Ohio has developed a\nlawful procedure.\n On the question of mootness, I agree with the majority that the plaintiffs had standing to\nbring the challenge to the notice form when the case was filed. However, I disagree with the\nconclusion that this case is not moot because the issues, save one, concerning the confirmation\nnotice form have been corrected by the Secretary. Cessation of certain \u201cconduct by government\nofficials has been treated with more solicitude by the courts than similar action by private\nparties.\u201d Mosley v. Hairston, 920 F.2d 409, 415 (6th Cir. 1990) (quoting Ragsdale v. Turnock,\n841 F.2d 1358, 1365 (7th Cir. 1988)). I agree with the district court that there is no evidence to\nshow that the Secretary would change the current notice, and this court should give him\ndeference on that question. However, I concur with the majority that the current notice does not\ncomply with the NVRA final mandate that when the Secretary sends the confirmation notice that\nthe registrant has been purged, the notice must provide \u201cinformation concerning how the\nregistrant can continue to be eligible to vote.\u201d 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 20507(d)(2)(B).\nThe district court found that this issue was waived by the plaintiffs for failure to include it\nin their pleadings before filing their reply brief. However, their motion for summary judgment\nargued that the confirmation notice forms do not advise people who have moved out of the State\nhow they could register in their new State. Although I agree with the district court that the State\nofficials have been given an \u201conerous burden of coaching out-of-state residents through the\nregistration process in their new States of residence,\u201d that is what the statute requires.\nThe district court ruled that the mandate only applies to give the registrant information about\nregistering in another location in Ohio, but the language of the statute is broader than that. In\ntheir brief on appeal, plaintiffs have suggested that an easy way to comply would be by directing\nvoters to the Election Assistance Commission\u2019s website containing the federal form, which\nprovides instructions and guidance for voter registration in all States. Although such a notice\nshould be easy to attach to the notification to the registrants, it assumes that all registrants know\n Case: 16-3746 Document: 39-2 Filed: 09/23/2016 Page: 24\nNo. 16-3746 A. Philip Randolph Inst., et al. v. Husted Page 25\nhow to utilize websites. Nevertheless, that is the relief which the plaintiffs have requested, and it\nseems simple enough for the Secretary to institute that amendment to the notice.\n Therefore, I would affirm the decision of the district court, except insofar as it declined to\nrequire the Secretary to amend its notice to voters who have moved to other states\"\n7 to 2\nwell"], [2965, "2017-11-13T04:00:00Z", [0.55], "i join @JMR2017\nKennedy and Roberts who really knows?\nthe supplemental list gets tossed on statutory grounds\nmy gut view\nis that removal violates statute.\nbut i need to read briefs"], [41366, "2017-11-13T03:18:38Z", [0.65], ""], [691, "2017-11-12T22:41:06Z", [0.22], ""], [32258, "2017-11-12T21:42:35Z", [0.85], ""], [32258, "2017-11-11T22:12:44Z", [0.55], "Will SC reverse the opinion written by Judge Eric Clay of the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals (appointed by President Bill Clinton)?

But as one may have noticed, everything has changed on many fronts since Trump won the Presidency so as usual, harder to predict. I think Kennedy is sensitive to overreach on the part of the administration and Republicans in red states on voting rights issues affected by gerrymandering, voter ID laws, purging of voter roles, etc. The Dept. of Justice has made it clear for the first time in a very long time that their position of defending voting rights has changed. SC knows there is an aggressive approach on the part of the DOJ to encourage purging (letter was sent to 44 states demanding information on their efforts to purge voters).  Solicitor General\u2019s office filed a brief in support of Ohio\u2019s laws.\nhttps://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/briefs/2017/08/07/16-980_husted_v_randolph_institute_ac_merits.pdf But Kennedy has voted with conservatives on voter ID laws and sided with conservatives on the 2013 Voting Rights Act case to end pre-clearance of changes to voting rights laws in states with records of discrimination.  Shelby County v. Holder Ohio's laws have been in place for many years and compared to other types of voter suppression laws, perhaps not as bad. Although in the 3 largest counties of Ohio, Democratic voters were removed at twice the rate of Republicans as a result of more Republicans voting in mid-term elections.  And race is a proxy for party and vice versa. So given overreach, one can see Kennedy voting to affirm in support of APRI and against Ohio.\nOn the other hand, Kennedy will never be taken for granted and that\u2019s why he maintains the middle ground. The details of this case seem much less egregious than other iterations of voter suppression... and purging voters from rolls has been around a long time.   I can envision Kennedy deciding with conservatives to reverse the 6th Circuit decision thereby making the supplemental process legal but perhaps adding instructions to improve the process. For example, how about an additional notification to voters well before the election that they will be removed from the rolls if they don't act? One other factor besides Kennedy to consider here is that the case is being heard late and maybe won't get decided in the current term."], [27155, "2017-11-11T21:30:04Z", [0.3], ""], [29054, "2017-11-11T19:28:53Z", [0.0], ""], [37115, "2017-11-11T02:42:45Z", [0.2], "I'd like to give it a lower likelihood, because the right to vote should not be taken away so cavalierly.

I'm giving my evaluation here slightly more confidence than the Masterpiece case which has more commentary out there for it.
