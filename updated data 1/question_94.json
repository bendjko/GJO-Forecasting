The new CEO is possibly a bit more honest with the future projections. An honest appraisal of TIME is also in order, and some proactive re-positioning may allow them to get ahead of a declining curve. Having said this, I'm just not so sure about the board of this firm. The board has again approved the regular quarterly dividend, which, at the current share price, yields an eye-popping 6+%. While claiming to seek to compete as a digital media firm, whose dividends are far more modest, it is continuing to pay dividends as if it were still in the monopoly news era. This firm, including TIME magazine, needs to be rationalized. For a variety of reasons the board is changing, so it is likely newer members will face the facts more candidly. There's something about this dividend that is not right. I'd look to find conflicts of interest that are keeping this rate so sticky.

I see no reason why weekly magazines sold by the annual subscription model cannot continue after we get most of the 'news\" electronically.  The daily news, online or in print is (or was) mainly reporting facts (often incorrect facts) while the news magazine is more about fitting the facts into a bigger picture of what the facts will mean mean to the readers in a longer time frame (e.g. its current affairs). \nSo if I take a guess that the decline in newspapers will bottom out in the next four years or so (say 50 months) and that while lots of local news papers will stop the print edition, it will perhaps result in 25% of weekly news magazines stopping their print editions that would suggest that no more than 0.5% of news magazines will stop their print editions each month.  \nhttp://newspaperdeathwatch.com/\nIts seems that newspapers (not magazines) in the US have been closing print editions at a rate of less than 2.5% a year which would suggest that my guess of 0.5% a month is too high and that 0.2% a month is a closer estimate. If so with only 3 months to go in 2016 the likelihood of any one newspaper closing its print edition is only around 0.6%.

As a non-expert, it seems to me that any speaker who goes to such lengths to emphasize how his conceptions of reality are so \"real,\" is either unsure of those conceptions himself, or is taking special pains to convince the listener that they are \"real,\" because he or she does not believe them to be so. 2) If we take only the new Chief Executive Officer (Mr. Battista) and the recently appointed Chief Content Officer (Mr. Murray) as representative of the mindset at Time Inc., we can safely say that the firm has no idea whatsoever about \"branding.\" This is a qualitative insight that you won't find in the filings. Both executives have articulated the same (shared) vision for the future of Time Inc.; namely, content will be created in \"topic centers\" and farmed out to individual titles after-the-fact. There are efficiencies, they believe, in creating content in this fashion. This is a great example of both a) a lack of system thinking, and b) a lack of understanding branding. I forget the exact formulation, but the Ackoff system rule goes something like this: optimizing a sub-system will de-optimize the overall system. By optimizing the economic efficiency of content creation, they are de-optimizing the effectiveness of brand loyalty. In short, branding is about self-identification of the user with the object. The reason why each brand has a writer on a topic is because, presumably, each writer has a specific viewpoint and voice that resonates with the users of that brand. A generic topic-centered content creation function does not accomplish that. In the short term users may be fooled, because the user will have some lingering faith in the title (label) of the brand. But long term, the user of a brand targeted at edgy eighteen year old females just won't resonate with content written by a fifty year old male. Does the fifty year old male even have any idea of the latest slang? Where is his oh-so-familiar experience that he can use as an analogy to connect the content to the reader? (He would have no such experience.) Horrible. Time Inc. is a latent disaster, and to make matters worse, the general declining print subscription demographics will be used to explain away a strategy that will be contributing to the acceleration of that decline. Vanity Fair: When Alan Murray got the chief content officer job earlier this summer, he talked to me about melding some of the individual brand identities a bit and making the content more topic specific instead of brand specific. Do you still see that as your plan going forward? Rich Battista: Absolutely. But you can still absolutely retain the brand identity. What we\u2019re talking about is how we leverage our content in smarter ways across the brand. Here\u2019s a perfect example: just recently there was some news story, and I think four or five of our brands posted about it at different times, four or five different writers wrote it, and it was a pretty generic entertainment story. To me, that doesn\u2019t seem very efficient. Why not have a news desk where everyone\u2019s sharing. You can say, \u201cO.K., on this one, why don\u2019t you take this and you create that story and then everybody wins because everyone can put it on their sites at the same time when it breaks.\u201d Just by saying the words \"you can still absolutely retain the brand identity,\" does not make it so. Not if the top two executives in the firm don't *really* understand branding. Oh yea, skipping over reading into the very strange \"we're/I\" construction, \"sometimes we\u2019re going to have to make hard decisions that I don\u2019t want to make\" may be indicative of some future action as to TIME."], [368, "2016-09-14T00:05:22Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-09-13T19:11:43Z", [0.04], ""], [498, "2016-09-13T17:01:08Z", [0.66], "Time Inc.

Poor salary systems can indeed, over time, result in misalignment of salaries and productive performance, but often salaries are just an (all too) easy metric to rely upon. I've bashed Time Inc. enough already, but my final observation in this regard is that I'm getting a clear sense that they have lost touch with the branding aspect of publishing. I was particularly struck by the implication from a recent interview with Murray where he suggested that centralized content centers (e.g., health, automotive, etc.) were a direction he might be moving in. There's some sine qua non missing in such an approach that seems vital to magazine/content  branding. Do people buy a magazine for the content, or visit a website for the content, or do they view themselves as readers/participants in certain kind of content? Perhaps some of the Russian thinking on \"reflexive\" psychology would help Murray, et. al. No doubt there are times when people chase content down, no matter where it is, based on interest in a particular subject. There is also, however, that aspect of readership/participation in media where the consumer allows the editorial staff to lead, in a sort of serendipitous journey, because the reader/participant identifies, in some sense, with the \"image\" of the brand. I fear that Time Inc. has lost this understanding. Time Inc. seems to have fallen into the same trap as the auditing profession in this regard. Many markets have the characteristic of the decision-makers being different than the revenue source being different than the end-users. I feel Time Inc. has lost its way in not understanding these dynamics of their markets. They seem to believe that advertisers are their customers.

In 2014 New York Magazine moved from a weekly to a bi-weekly. At that time, their subscriber base was approximately 400,000. The change in frequency resulted in annual cost savings of $3.5 million. If we assume similar cost structures (the cost savings per subscriber would be the same), a change in frequency to bi-weekly for TIME magazine (with approximately 3,000,000 subscribers) would result in $26.25 million in annual cost savings. It is interesting that at least in the case of New York magazine, by increasing the number of printed pages per issue, they were able to maintain the total number of paid advertising pages per year. \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/02/business/media/long-on-cutting-edge-of-print-new-york-magazine-cuts-back.html Moody's downgrades Time Inc.\nhttps://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-downgrades-Time-Inc-Corporate-Family-Rating-to-B1--PR_353260?WT.mc_id=AM%7eWWFob29fRmluYW5jZTQyX1NCX1JhdGluZyBOZXdzX0FsbF9Fbmc%3d%7e20160805_PR_353260&yptr=yahoo Despite the comments from Moody's re: the dividend, I just don't see how management can justify a 5.4% dividend yield on this stock.

I'm not sure when the best time to announce any change in publishing frequency would be, but no such announcement was made today. (-2) Some observations/interpretations:\n1) They achieved \"crossover\" on advertising, where increase in digital advertising revenue exceeded decrease in print revenue. Digital advertising revenue increased at an impressive 65%, whereas print revenue decreased by 13%. It is unclear if the crossover in terms of profitability has occurred.\n2) \"Excluding Viant acquisition, digital advertising revenue would have increased 10% year over year.\" Without knowing how they account for intra-company sales, it is difficult to know exactly how to interpret this statement. On the surface, however, this is a rather shocking statement. By \"on the surface\" I mean that the ad sales from the \"digitalization\" of everything Time had prior to Viant, as well all the other non-Viant digital acquisitions, increased by only 10%. This seems like they are unable to touch new customers with existing products.\n3) As I read the financials, they burned through $331 million in cash for the quarter. This is an unsustainable rate (although by definition any negative cashflow is unsustainable). Recent announcements of personnel cuts will reduce editorial costs, but will not likely be enough to cover the negative cashflow by itself. Without knowing what the net estimated savings would be in terms of a TIME frequency change we are very much in the dark, but looking to production costs as the next area to cut would mean that such a change in frequency may very much be on the table. Something needs to give with the cashflow.\n4) The share price for Time Inc. declined by 8.43% on heavy volume today. With the announcement of the regular dividend, this stock has a yield of 4.9%.\n5) Time Inc. continues to claim that they are in the acquisitive mode, although I do not know where they would find the cash. I would not be surprised if they themselves were acquired by the likes of Verizon (although with the decline in share price today it does not seem that the market anticipates this scenario).\n6) I have recently begun hearing media commentators refer to TIME not as a \"news\" magazine, but as a \"political\" magazine.

As such, it is publishers that are making the appropriate trade-offs and undertaking the appropriate innovations to drive brand growth. By going to \"editorial director\" as the title for the group heads, I can only wonder where the commercial business sense, as it relates to particular properties, is to be exercised. Is it only to be exercised at the next higher-level up? That's a recipe for disaster. Is the re-titling supposed to be a signal that Time Inc. hasn't forgotten the \"content\" side?

In the last conference call, an analyst requested that the company break-out digital acquisitions from organic digital properties. The idea being to discover where, exactly, the top-line digital growth is coming from (similar, in a sense, as to how retail sales are broken out excluding store locations less than twelve months old). The fear is that firms just \"buy topline growth through acquisitions\" (or new location expansions) and don't manage the existing properties well. If I were an analyst following Time I'd want an answer to that question also. That layoffs are in the wind means that they are feeling the heat from the negative cashflow. There are cost savings on the table waiting to be had by cutting the publishing frequency. This is where inter-company accounting can get *really* tricky. I can see offering combined print/digital advertising packages. That makes good sense. When it comes down to allocating the revenues between platforms, however, this is where the incentives of expectations can really screw things up. I'd be wary of the allocation accounting if I were an analyst. I wonder how long they'll be able to maintain a 4.76% dividend yield. Time Inc.

We basically reach 80% of the adults anyone is trying to reach with the permissions that we have to reach them and track them and follow them, so MySpace has really been all about permissions.\" No doubt tracking and all that comes off of that is valuable.

In as much as the same PRINTER prints both Newsweek and TIME I would imagine some of the cost  and fulfillment calculus would be similar in decision-makers minds. What looks like happened was after the 2008-9 dip, they took a wait and see approach, then 2009-10 there was an equivalent dip, which then levelled off for two more years until 2012 when they shut down. So I am guessing the the break-even or profit calculation breaks down somewhere in 2009-2010 and they wanted to see if circulation would recover, and they waited 2 years and then realized it wasn't going back up, perhaps they even took some marketing measures to keep it those levels.  In any case, what I take from that is they have a 'wait and see' approach, and some sort of hidden 'break-even/profit margin calculation' hidden in there. Now according to that chart TIME magazine has been steady at its current levels gone down a bit since 2008, so either they are comfortably above those hidden triggers for shutdown or the fact that TIME print edition is the centerpiece of the brand is enough to keep them printing.  Furthermore, according to this article NEWSWEEK is returning to print, indicating that they felt it was a mistake to stop printing. \nhttp://adage.com/article/media/time-magazine-redesigns-website-newsweek-returns-print/292000/ In addition, the article suggests that TIME print subscriptions and advertising (as of 2014 March) were still a huge part of TIME's revenues, furthermore, TIME is a big part of Time Warner's strategy moving forward.  \"Time parent Time Inc. is spinning off from parent Time Warner in the second quarter, meaning the publishing company won't have thriving entertainment businesses to help shelter it during rough weather. Time is a key part of the company's strategy going forward, according to Time Editor Nancy Gibbs.\" Based on this alone, I'd say there are slim to none chances of an announcement that the print edition will cease to be printed by the forecast date. Unless ofcourse, the person who formulated this question has some other inside information or other articles that they did not care to link in the forecast stem, which leads me to why THIS QUESTION IS TOTALLY VAGUE.  Why say \"ANNOUNCE\" before 2017 does this mean no print edition in 2017 or that they announce the future date that print editions will be eliminated? Is the forecast question alluding to some other subtext that might be better off mentioned in the forecast? If they intend to continue printing in 2017  why would they announce they will no longer print in 2018, it most likely would not positively affect sales, could bump them, but then they can't go back on that promise to stop printing. The platform is supposed to drive for PRECISE forecasts with cutoff dates, this question is either poorly articulated or intentionally masking some other important subtext, in either case either the question should be revised or additional NEWS article links added to the question stem.  Another thing that bodes well for time is the average age of readership is relatively up there. The highest print circulating magazine is the AARP brochure, so I think that it's not much of a stretch to suggest there might be an overlapping demographic for the print edition. People who are not so digital now, and are only getting older.  Opening a ticket on this question for it to rephrased or additional info added.

Far less, some might say, than an ordinary understanding of \"weekly.\"\n2) Per Time Inc. 2015 10-K, Time recognizes FTC regulation as an important variable effecting aspects of performance.\n3) Based on limited research, I have tentatively concluded that, despite my initial assumption, there is no industry standard definition for a magazine \"weekly.\" This, despite the fact that the term is used throughout the industry. Per the Time Inc. 2015 10-K, Time declares TIME to be a \"Weekly Newsmagazine.\" As part of my research into the \"weekly\" issue, I contacted a leading magazine industry consultant. Here is her verbatim reply: \"I know of no standard.  The USPS [United States Postal Service] requires publishers to describe their frequency in their mastheads and you can see just how much variety there is by reading those.  Often weekly publications come out 50 times a year with \"double issues\" accounting for the weeks that are missed.  (Those double issues always look like just regular issues to me, usually!). There is no official place that I know of that decides who can call themselves a weekly.  I think publishers can define their frequency any way they want to.\" Where I'm going with this is that I can imagine a scenario where, without any change in physical frequency whatsoever, Time Inc. would be required by the FTC to \"come clean\" on the arguably deceptive business practice of marketing TIME as a weekly newsmagazine yet only publishing 44 issues per year. It is also possible Time Inc. itself just decides to \"come clean\" on the issue. Now admittedly it's a muddy area. It would be unreasonable, I believe, to insist that publishers always adhere to some inflexible standard, because there are various reasons a publisher might wish to do special or combined issues from time-to-time to benefit the customer; and yes, even themselves once-and-awhile. The problem arises, as it so often does, when the discretion afforded to a party becomes systematically and routinely abused. Without getting into the detail of actually counting the pages per issue type (not that this is definitive), it appears that TIME is (at least) fairly close to routinely abusing that discretion. Long story short here: TIME may announce a change due to regulatory pressure or the adoption of better marketing communications with their customers. It is possible, however, that even with such a change in \"policy,\" the respective announcement would never state that \"TIME will no longer be publishing a weekly edition,\" because the reason they would be making such a policy announcement in the first place was because this statement was, strictly speaking, false! [Edit: One thing we can say, I think, from the industry expert, is that the masthead is one, if not \"the place,\" where the magazine publisher announces its publishing frequency, as required by USPS regulation.]"], [498, "2016-02-20T02:26:47Z", [0.65], "Time Inc. anticipates more restructuring in 2016\nhttp://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/media/2016/02/8591436/time-inc-anticipates-more-restructuring-2016 Time Inc. 2015 10-K\nhttp://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1591517/000159151716000039/timeinc4q2015.htm I am assuming that, at the conclusion of some detailed analysis, cost savings available from a reduction in issue frequency for TIME magazine can be shown to more than make-up for any reduction in advertising and subscription revenue (if any) that would be associated with such a change. Given that there are offsetting reductions in advertising and subscription revenues, however, and that TIME already employs a number of \"combined issues,\" and that TIME magazine is just one property among many of the company, such savings (if any) will probably not be sufficient in and of themselves to motivate such a change. That \"the bulk of our U.S. printing is consolidated under multi-year contracts with a single printer\" deserves scrutiny. I must say, I enjoy total honesty. Here's a cited risk: \"the ability to incur significant additional indebtedness.\" It's saying debt may not always be the right solution for funding a particular initiative, but since people are so willing to lend to us, we need to discipline ourselves in terms of whether and how we obtain our debt funding. While a big positive signal for management in general, it is but a tiny positive signal for frequency reduction, which would be capital generated internally via cost savings.

Those changes may include closing or selling some of the company's brands, or partnering with other companies on products.  \"We intend to continue to evaluate our portfolio for opportunities to make internal investments, pursue strategic partnerships, close or divest titles, brands or operations where necessary, launch new titles, brands or operations and evaluate acquisition opportunities when they arise,\" according to the annual report. To that end, the company said that it expects to see more restructuring costs in the future, on top of the $191 million it spent in 2015 on restructuring, certain costs related to the company's office move, and building out new infrastructure. \"We anticipate additional headcount and efficiency measures in the future including global sourcing of personnel, streamlining the editorial process, centralized procurement, and further elimination of duplication across brands,\" the 10-K read in part. But Time Inc. also highlighted the areas that it is investing in, most notably using data for better ad targeting, branded content, live events and video. The company said in the filing that it was \"exploring the possibilities for an ad-supported over-the-top network for People and Entertainment Weekly.\" ime Inc. also continues to be an active player when it comes to acquisitions. According to the filing the company spent $141 million on acquisitions in 2015, and just this week announced that it had bought two popular automotive Youtube channels, for an undisclosed price.  The company says it expects to pay out another $13 million in earn-outs and deferred payments related to those transactions. Time Inc. moved from midtown to the Financial District last Fall, and the costs associated with the move are highlighted in the filing. Also of note: while its lease for its new corporate headquarters at 225 Liberty St. runs through 2032, the company has an option that it can exercise in August 2022 to reduce the amount of space it occupies.

Is there \"resolving criteria\" somewhere that I don't know of?  All I see is:  \"In 2012, Newsweek stopped publishing the weekly print edition\".  To me, this suggests that the only way that this question will resolve as \"yes\" is if Time magazine does what Newsweek did.  It leaves unclear to me if Time must do EXACTLY what Newsweek did, or just some variation of it. Conservatively, I'd say that any ANNOUNCED deviation from the current \" WEEKLY\" (such as it is), PRINT edition IN THE US will cause this to resolve as \"yes\". In that case,  I'm going to increase my forecast because I had not considered that a change in the publishing schedule would result in a positive resolution of this question. While I do not think Time is going to go digital, it wouldn't surprise me if more \"combined\" (ie bi-weekly) editions were printed, or if it just simply went bi-weekly.

Having thus achieved their objective of \"stabilizing revenue,\" they should be ready to make their next big move. Maybe it will include a change in frequency for TIME magazine. Depending on their evaluation of the news weekly (or bi-weekly) category, they might even sell the property. TIME magazine as a property is not, of course, broken out in the 8-K, but it doesn't seem that the cost savings available from moving to a bi-weekly frequency for this one magazine would be all that significant on a company-wide basis; although anything might help.

On my last visit I reported that the physical quality of TIME was very poor, including paper quality and finish, compared on both an historical and other magazines in the rack basis. Today, however, I noticed a magazine that caught my attention first because of its slightly reduced trim size. Examining it, I noted that it was comparatively high in terms of physical production and quality. The reason I mention all this is that a variable that I have assumed would be \"constant\" was the physical production costs (because they already appeared so low). This new magazine raises the possibility that there has been some dramatic printing and/or paper technology advancement that I had not anticipated, and that changing to this new method (if it is in fact new) might change around some aspects of this question. It's actually a very attractive trim/format/quality with excellent tactile appeal, and unless it's a premium format, I expect more magazines to go that way.]"], [691, "2016-02-12T20:12:37Z", [0.07], ""], [60, "2016-02-12T03:46:11Z", [0.02], "Lowering from 9 to 2%.

Overseen by the editors who produce Time magazine and Time.com, the new website site will include contributions by celebrities and politicians, plus original reporting from Time magazine staffers. To help contain costs, Time Inc.\u2019s Real Simple, Southern Living and Health will also provide articles. The debut is the company\u2019s latest stab at ramping up its digital advertising reach at a time when print ad revenue is declining. Time Inc.\u2019s print and other advertising revenue fell 12% to $319 million for third quarter ended Sept. 30. While digital advertising revenue increased 22% to $79 million, it wasn\u2019t enough to offset the decline in print.\n[...]\nThe company said more than half of Motto\u2019s readers are expected to visit via their mobile phones and tablets. Many of Motto\u2019s stories will also eventually be available on Facebook\u2019s Instant Articles platform, said Mr. Felsenthal, while some videos will be posted to YouTube. Callie Schweitzer has been named editorial director of the website, which has two full-time staffers. \u201cIt\u2019s intended to be inspirational and motivational,\u201d said Ms. Schweitzer, who is also editorial director, audience strategy for Time Inc. The new website plans to post a dozen new stories daily plus two new videos. Advertisers for its launch on Wednesday included Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\u2019s Geico insurance unit. Meredith Long, publisher of Time magazine and its related digital properties, said Motto\u2019s audience will appeal to marketers ranging from technology to automotive to finance, plus beauty and consumer packaged goods companies. Motto is part of a string of investments Time Inc. has made in recent months to cater to younger women. In October, the magazine publisher bought HelloGiggles.com, a pop culture, beauty and lifestyle website. One person familiar with terms estimated the purchase price was in the range of $20 million. The same month, Time Inc. also purchased two websites aimed at younger women\u2014xoJane.com and xoVain.com\u2014for an undisclosed sum from Say Media Inc. Reaching younger readers online has been a popular initiative for big magazine companies. Cond\u00e9 Nast, a unit of closely held Advance Publications Inc., in October purchased Pitchfork Media Inc. in a bid to boost its access to young men.

My impressions are only based on a dozen or so such visits since the inception of this Question. My observations were limited by the fact that I employ a number of various script and ad-blockers with my browser. First, perhaps because of my blockers, I am not seeing any advertising at all for the bulk of my visits. As a recommendation to TIME, they should deliver some classy, non-obtrusive, minimal, single advertisement to every visitor by default (if blockers prevent generation of a custom ad). Second, for those ads that are delivered (I don't know why sometimes and sometimes not), the advertisers are of the type I identified previously in my anecdotal survey of a printed issue (https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/90552 ); namely, very large corporations with massive advertising budgets placing \"image\" (versus product) placements. These advertisements were not just pick-ups of those in the printed issue. So, I'm thinking, and the whole point of this post, is that Time Inc. (or TIME) may be making big progress in improving its online advertising revenue. One could imagine that if a sufficient set of these very large (big ad budget) corporations (e.g., IBM) could be corralled with some type of multi-year special relationship (and price) \"bundle\" arrangement, Time Inc. might very well find the funds necessary to \"cut-the-cord\" (a bit at least) on the print side. This is all a long way of saying they may have gotten some topline breathing room, but rather than coast on it, they move with it. (+3) [Edit#1: Although it may have been ongoing for ages, and TIME has \"always\" been in the repackaging of video, the movement of TIME into the original video production space has also caught my eye (e.g., http://time.com/4184576/time-pbs-year-in-space/ ) I'm noticing this in both short clips which accompany text articles, and well as fuller original documentary type videos. I'm not sure how this directly pertains to the question, except that maybe their base of online material is becoming not only larger, but \"fuller,\" if that makes sense. These steps are good, although they must be quite expensive. I wish them a lot of luck, and I am convinced that with creativity and ingenuity it can be pulled off.] [Edit#2: I see an opportunity for a kind of hybrid between original production and repackaging of video. If TIME can get enough strategic contacts established with external video producers, and maintain awareness of that material, they could become a powerhouse of centralized hybrid content by leaving (some percentage of?) these costs external to the firm while still delivering the fullest content offerings. Interesting questions would be underwriting versus acquisition or licensing, content direction and control, etc.]"], [368, "2016-01-18T22:13:34Z", [0.05], ""], [484, "2016-01-18T17:02:20Z", [0.45], "Down 20% to be closer to consensus.

There are some number of \"combined issues.\" The number of combined issues appears to be at the publisher's discretion; so Time Inc. may already have plans to add another combined issue or two this year as compared to last. They could achieve some cost savings by reduced paper (and printing) and mailing costs (neither of which would likely exceed those of two stand-alone issues). So, we are not forecasting the \"thing,\" but only the \"name.\" (-5)\n2) The quality of the paper is dramatically inferior to years past. Whatever tactile appeal magazines may have once had, is lost in TIME. Photo quality suffers as well.\n3) The collection of advertisers is kind of funny. It's a slice of corporate America (mostly) that you need to see for yourself to get the feel. Big pharma (many), insurance companies (many), AARP and other senior citizen groups, banks, Volkswagen (curious), US Ad Council, and Mexican vacations. Plus an Amazon and another ad that likely reflects some traded advertising as part of their recent strategic relationships. In general, I saw the advertisers as representing very large firms with massive advertising budgets that are probably not required to justify their advertising spend in terms of effectiveness. It's image (versus product) advertising dollars that are farmed through agencies and the like. It would be just that collection of advertisers if there was some group that wanted to support a mainstream narrative of reality. These are not the kind of advertisers that will likely go away if there is a (further) frequency change; but perhaps more importantly, they are so locked in that they can be milked with the current frequency and rate hikes quite a bit longer. [Edit#1: There probably is some magazine industry convention that dictates when some number of pre-planned \"combined issues\" knocks one out of the \"weekly\" category. Or, there may not be. Based on the number of combined issues I saw, I'm guessing they only publish 45 or so issues (mailings) per year at present.] [Edit#2: I'm reducing my forecast because there are less cost savings readily available via reduction in frequency than I had initially assumed. I'm not taking it too much lower at present because having already picked up the \"low hanging fruit\" of combined issues, it is likely any further reduction in frequency will force them to declare themselves ineligible for the \"weekly\" category. How the industry determines a \"weekly\" is unknown to me, but knowable, and important.]"], [498, "2016-01-13T02:28:00Z", [0.65], ""], [691, "2016-01-12T22:58:31Z", [0.18], ""], [15071, "2016-01-12T13:40:08Z", [0.35], ""], [12069, "2016-01-12T12:21:55Z", [0.05], "most of time magazine demographic is made up of older readers that would find the change to digital complicated....most don't even own a tablet...."], [6769, "2016-01-12T01:07:34Z", [0.15], ""], [102, "2016-01-12T00:56:47Z", [0.12], ""], [73, "2016-01-11T22:33:39Z", [0.02], "Capitulation   http://www.stockhouse.com/news/press-releases/2016/01/11/time-inc-appoints-steve-marcopoto-president-of-time-inc-international.

It's a rational assumption that publishers make the decision based on a few factors: 1) demographic trends in their consumer base, 2) relatedly, preferences of their user base in how they want to consume news media, and 3) ability to maximize operating margins, as a function of revenue (from consumer subscriptions + advertising) relative to costs. My sense is that Time has a large and aging consumer demographic (i.e. the majority of their paid home subscribers are older than 35) and many paid enterprise subscribers like dentist offices, law firms, universities, and libraries want to make print copies of publications available to visitors. Based on these assumptions, I think that Time still gets a significant proportion of its subscriber revenue from print subscribers, and wouldn't want to risk shrinking its paid subscriber base by forcing subscribers to consume Time exclusively in a digital format anytime soon. Also, assuming the New York Times is a good proxy for Time in terms of core subscriber audience, it's notable that the NYT decided to expand aggressively into digital subscriptions a few years ago while still maintaining a daily print version of the paper. Of course, the other plausible reason TIME would no longer publish a weekly print edition is existential: suppose it just can't continue to make money as a news magazine, or the costs of publishing weekly are unsustainable financially? So, to save costs, TIME's editorial board may continue the print publication, but publish on a monthly basis instead of a weekly basis. :) Looking at the performance of Time's parent company, Time, Inc., on the NYSE in the last year, there's been a pretty steady-rate decline totaling 40% in valuation. This suggests that some of its media properties are not faring well financially, and is likely increasing shareholder pressure to scale back or shut down losing properties while investing more in profitable ones. In the event that this rate of decline in valuation continues--or accelerates--I would expect more drastic decisions  possibly by new executive leadership re: frequency of publishing print version of Time magazine.

TIME US Audience Profile --> http://www.timemediakit.com/audience/ Looking at the median age (49) and median household income ($70K) lead me to believe that these are people who probably aren't about to unsubscribe from their magazine subscription (i.e. disposal income and a habit of already having subscribed). 2. Top 100 magazines by circulation --> http://www.psaresearch.com/images/TOPMAGAZINES.pdf TIME comes in at 13 (with about 3.3 million) and is approximately 500K from being in the Top 10. On the flip side, they'd have to lose about 500K in circulation to fall out of the Top 20. Given the magazines below/above them, it seems unlikely that TIME would end their print edition. 3. TIME's declining circulation --> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)#Circulation TIME's circulation has been declining, but if I could find the total industry's circulation, I suspect it would be down, too. My point from this link is that TIME's circulation dropped to 3.4 million in 2007 and so we can conclude that it's been around the same circulation for about the last 10 years. ~~~ COMMENT: Part of me wants to just \"shoot the moon\" and forecast 0% for this question, but there's still that possibility. To put it in context for my forecasts, I think the TTIP negotiation (at this point), is also very unlikely, but I've got it set at 2% right now (i.e. I think there's a better chance that the TTIP negotiations come to pass than TIME ending its weekly print edition).
