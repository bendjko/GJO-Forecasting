I don't especially trust the ICC rankings for T20 internationals, due to lack of matches between tournaments in this format, but India are ranked number one, and have plenty of players ranked near the top. Every bookmaker currently has India as favourites to win.  Holding me back from going further is the inherent unpredictability of T20 cricket compared to other formats. With only 4 matches in the first round, losing 2 could put you out, and India are definitely not invincible. As there are only two group, both are hard, and Australia, New Zealand and Pakistan are all decent teams who can beat India.

India are favourites, but I don't think any team has a higher than 1/4 chance of winning at this point. In terms of other teams - England have been playing well in short form cricket, but really only compared to what went before, so have an alright shot.

South Africa mostly does well in these low stake matches while India does  better in world cups. On top of that, India's home support  give definite edge to India. \nThat said, T20 remains the most difficult version to call. T20 world cups have produced 5 different winners in previous 5 editions. On the other hand, 4 out the past 5 50-over world cup tournaments have been won by Australia. So we can not ascribe significantly high probability to any one nation.\nNow to maths:\nIndia can advance to next stage (semi-final) by either winning the group or coming second. \n\nI estimate that India has 36% probability of winning the group and 45% of coming second. I have just considered one path to the top - winning all its matches. Similarly, there is 45% probability that India loses just one of its four matches which will ensure at least a second spot in the group. \nI know there could be other permutations also but that would only increase the probability (apart from increasing the complexity to calculate the odds).  India's progression to Final and to the title will depend on who it faces in these rounds. I believe India's chances to win the semi-final is higher if it does not face South Africa. Similarly, the chances to win the Final are higher if the opposition is not Australia.

Two countries out of four from the group proceed to the semi-finals [1] .\n- First, let's look at the wisdom of the bookies. They heavily favour India winning the 2016 ICC: \n * a aggregate of 10 bookies gives India a 26% of winning, with a standard deviation of 2%   [3]\n * another aggregate of 28 bookies give India a 33% change of winning, with a standard deviation of 3%  [7] - Second, let's now examine the pathways towards a win. For this, India first has to come first or second in the group. \n * India has 11 pathways to obtain 2 or more wins\n * The chance of India becoming #1 or #2 is approximated by taking the ODI outcomes of historical matches in India (so which have the home advantage, but are different to T20 matches) [2] [5] [6]:\n * India - Pakistan  30 matches :         11 wins, 19 lost      ( 51 wins, 72 lost overall)  \n * India - New Zealand  26 matches:  21 wins,  5 lost       (46 wins, 41 lost overall)\n * India - Australia  46 matches:          21 wins, 25 lost      (40 wins, 48 lost)\n * India against qualifier from Round A : this will be either Bangladesh, Netherlands, Ireland or Oman: 23%/24% = 93%  (using Bookies [3])\n * the statistics for the 11 pathways to reach the semi-finals gives a 91% chance  (for example pathway 1 = 11/30 * 21/26 * 25/46 * 5%)  - Third, for India to win the semi-final and final requires 2 wins which I compute using an aggregate of 9 Bookies [3]:\n* India has a 3.8 'score', meaning 1-in-3.8 chance of winning, with the average score of the other 7 best contestants being 8.1, and best 3 other being 7.3). Winning the semi against the 7 best others and final agains the 4 best others gives: 26%/38% * 26%/40% = 45%\n- Mathmatical chance of winning, is winning the first group times chance of winning semi-final and final: 93% * 45% = 42% FORECAST: finishing by averaging the two bookies and my own calculation gives: 42% + 26% + 33% / 3 = 34%\n___________________ Note: the country ranking  for the ICC tournament is for the whole of the ongoing ICC tournament, not just the ICC 2016 games.
