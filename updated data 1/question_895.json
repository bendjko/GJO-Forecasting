The bond market, not far from a state that typically precedes a recession, says not so fast. The decision of which to heed looms large when the Fed\u2019s interest-rate setters meet next week. Which path they follow will begin to define whether Chairman Jerome Powell engineers a sustained, recession-free era of full employment, or spoils the party with interest rate increases that prove too much for the economy to swallow. New Fed staff research and Powell\u2019s own remarks seem to put more weight on the risks of super-tight labor markets, which could mean a shift up in the Fed\u2019s rate outlook and a tougher tone in its rhetoric. Goldman Sachs economists, for instance, contend the Fed\u2019s \u201coptimal\u201d rate path is \u201cwell above market pricing under a broad range of assumptions.\u201d They see four increases likely next year, while investors expect only one or two, a significant gap. Fed officials have telegraphed a likely quarter-point rate increase when they meet on Tuesday and Wednesday next week, and investors expect that, plus another in December.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  I think 97% for 3 raises is correct for this CY, but I'm not that confident there will be 3 by 10/1.

From the articles I have read, there is a strong case for 3 or 4 total rate hikes this year.\n2. There has already been 1 this year (March)\n3. There are 5 remaining meetings this year, 3 within the timeframe of this question.\n4. Historically over the past year, the rate seems to have a pattern of raising every other meeting. Given the debate, I start off with looking at the full year, and just decided to give a 50/50 split to whether it will be 3 or 4 for the year.  So the realistic question becomes, \"will there be 1, 2, or 3 more raises before September 30th?   If there are 2 more rate hikes this year (for a total of 3), then the likelihood, just based on the remaining 5 meetings, is about 30% that both will happen prior to the end of the year, and a 60% likelihood that there will only be 1 more.  The remaining 10% is for 0 more raises.   If there are 3 more rate hikes this year (for a total of 4), then the likelihood, is about  20% for 1 more, 70% for 2 more, and 10% for 3 more.   So given that we don't know if there will be 3 this year or 4, I will weigh both evenly.  \n0 raises: 5%\n1 raise: 40%\n2 raises: 50%\n3 raises: 5% Now, given the current news, and a likely raise on June 12th, I am deducting 4 points from \"Less than 2\", and giving 2 points to \"2\", 1 point to \"3\", and 1 point to \"4 or more\". This brings me to my forecast above.  This will update on the week of the 12th, after the next meeting.   Given the nature that the group typically raises every other meeting, and it is highly unlikely to see increases 3 meetings in a row, I am reducing \"4 or more\" by 5 points, and giving them all to \"3\".

Labor Market\n   - Fed has dual mandate: target inflation to 2% and full employment\n   - The official unemployment is about 4% (which is normally considered full employment), but because of the prolong recession, labor participation is still low and there is more room for it to run up. This also account for the absent of wage increase pressure.\n   Rising rate cool down economy, slow down rate of job creation, so this is an argument against more frequent rate hike. 2. Recent Tax Law\n  - Prior to 2017, US Corporations parked income earned overseas to avoid paying repatriation tax;\n  - They invest mostly on short term bonds, and that may include US treasury bonds;\n  - They issue bonds in the US to raise money to pay dividends, buy back stocks.\n  - In 2018, US companies doesn't have much incentive to park money overseas and will use the money to buy back their bonds.\n   - Stop buying and start selling short term bonds -> bond price lower, yield higher on short term;\n   - Stop selling and buy back corporate bonds -> bond price higher, yield lower on medium and long term;\n   These have effect of flattening the yield curve, spooked the market in February. While the net effect on cost of capital isn't clear, it seems this would increase the cost of economic activity over all, since economic activities are more affected by medium to long term bonds yield. (Thinking of 30 year mortgage interest, 10 year bond for expansion). Since hiking rate is just a tool to increase cost of capital, if yield already increase, there would be less need for increasing lending rate. 3. Fed Balance Sheet\n - During Quantitative Easing (QE), Fed print money to buy bonds, forcing bond price up, yield down and increase money in circulation.\n - Now Fed is letting short-term bond mature, in effect flatten the yield curve by not buying new short-term bonds to replace what expired. This also decrease money in circulation.\n There is talk that Fed may have to do an inverse-QE: sell long term bonds to buy some short term bonds, renormalize the yield curve. This would somewhat cool down the economy for reasons explained in (2) above. 4. Trade War\n  - Everybody agrees that a full fledge trade war with China would plunge the world back into recession, eliminates the chance of rate increase for the rest of the year;\n  - But trade war comes in many shapes and forms. There is the real one, and there is the fake one. So far, Trump has not announced the extensive ones yet. Chinese respond seems to be restrained. The most significant answer from China was not slapping back tariff on steel and recycled aluminum or pork, or wine, but the threat of not buying as much treasury. \n - There is also talk that Trump recent move was to coral China into cooperation about North Korea.    Not buying treasury means price lower, yield higher, raising the cost of capital. 5. Deficit Spending\n - The US continue on its trajectory of increasing deficit, meaning it will have to issue more treasury bonds, decrease bond price and increase cost of borrowing. I believe there will be one more rate increase between now and September 30. The three rate hikes people talked about is during 2018, not until Sep 30. There could still be chance to have 2 more until Sept 30, and none in December.

Assuming that this is their baseline, it implies that they will skip a hike in one of the live meetings (June, Sep, Dec). Which one? June is the least likely candidate, as the current momentum should be sustained in the short run (barring shocks, of course, but here we are talking about the baseline). September: no if the economy is doing as the Fed expects (well) in Q2-Q3. So under the Fed's current baseline, the answer to this question will likely be 3 hikes (March, June, September). Now, what can go wrong with the economy between now and September? First, policy shocks - a trade war with China certainly qualifies. This will likely start playing out already in Q2. Second, a sharp move up in market (Treasury bonds) interest rates - spooked by the large fiscal deficit (projected at over $800 billion in the fiscal year ending at Sep 30, 2018), and perhaps a drop in foreign demand for Treasuries. This I see more likely for Q3-Q4, if it comes at all. Third, the expected short-term tailwind from fiscal policy (tax cuts + expenditure hikes) may be weaker than expected (labor shortages may play a role). This will only be known by September, if not later, given data lags.  Overall, I'd say a June hike is a high-probability even (say, 95%), preventable only by a large-scale trade war with China (and others - the EU?) unfolding already in Q2. For September, I am leaning 70-30 in favor of a hike. This yields the forecast above. To be reassessed after (1) we see what, if any, trade sanctions are imposed on China and the Chinese reaction, and (2) economic growth in Q1 (together with wages/employment dynamics in March/April).

The protectionist measures may fuel inflation, a fact pointed out by those believing the Fed will raise rate more frequently. However, one must be careful of what's the talk and what's the walk. So far, tariffs proposal aren't across the board to the extend that fuel inflation. The effect of what has been proposing so far is benign. Any talk of heavy tariffs have been walked back to some extend.

(3.5% in December, 2.83% in March).   I believe that having increased rates in December, and seeing growth lower sharply, there is no chance they will raise in March. More tellingly, the Fed lowered its target for full employment from 4.8% to 4.6%.   \nThe Fed has dual goals:  lowering inflation and ensuring full employment.   Lowering the  target of full employment is a tell for two factors. First.  In the discussion of employment, the Fed noted that worker participation in the usual prime employment ages is down more than 2.5%.    They correctly noted that there is more than adequate slack in employment to absorb future employment gains, even considering retirement data.  Second.  Dropping the full employment rate to 4.6% is a tacit admission that the number they had previously considered full employment (somehow) is not actually as useful a barometer of employment as previously.   The historical norm has been reached, suggesting that there should be significant wage pressure - and yet there is not.   The Fed essentially punted on an explanation - merely guessing that structural changes have changed where the full employment number is.  Either way, lowering the full employment number combined with the mandate for full employment, suggests that the fed will continue to have tolerance for easy money policy. Additionally, inflation.  Much of the fed discussion focused around how inflation is currently under their target rate of 2.0 percent.   Core inflation is 1.7%    There are no inflationary pressures to argue for higher interest  rates.   Plus the Fed is hypersensitive to the worries of deflation that occured in the last recession. As I write this, oil markets have just dropped from their peak of $70 to $62.   Energy costs are the primary component of core inflation; inflationary pressures will lower over the next month.  Our economies are rather like drowning swimmers.  In the early 70's unbridled by crippling debt 'normal' interests rates were 7%.  However, after each subsequent recession the new maximum has declined 6%.. 5%.. 4%.. and so it must, as western nations are drowning in  huge amounts of debt, that were interest rates to rise they could not pay.    Yield curves have already flattened.  The point:  The Fed's expectation over interest rate rises is predicated by its past experiences.   In earlier times, the fed might make 8 or 10 interest rate changes.  And so based on bygone experience the fed publishes that they expect 4 interest rate changes this year.   But current circumstance do not afford that robustness.  The Fed will want to raise interest rates - because it has only very few tools at its disposal. It has the ability to raise interest rates - and lower interest rates.  It knows that with interest rates sitting at 1.25-1.5% that it has very little wiggle room during the next recession.  And so it would like to raise those rates, certainly up to 2%.    But its rather like an old aged dowager, playing an old record, thinking of times that will never be; or a farm horse returning to a burned down barn.  TLDR:   The fed wants to increase rates, If they do not increase in March, that leaves May, June, Aug, Sep, Nov, December.   Three rate increases a year, with spaces to examine effects suggests  Mar/ Aug/ December. I think they are going to take a pass for March.  I think they will increase in May, and september.

Assuming the momentum will carry at least into the first half of Q2, a June hike is also a high probability. Beyond this things get a little more uncertain, but unless the economy slows down sharply in late spring/summer, a September hike seems likely as well. Now what are the main factors that would affect the economy by mid-year? The tax cuts provide some tailwind in the short run, while possible trade wars work the other way. However, provided most US allies are exempt from the recent steel and aluminum tariffs, their negative effect would be limited, I believe. And interest rates, while rising, are still low enough not to be a main drag on consumer and investment spending.    What can go wrong with this forecast? First and foremost, trade wars may materialize. Trump might refuse to exempt the European allies (NATO be damned :)), and the EU my retaliate, leading to further tit-for-tat. In such an environment, China may retaliate too, feeling emboldened by the EU reaction to the US tariffs. In such a scenario, the Fed may pause in September to assess the situation. (June should still be a hike, though). Another risk is that the market interest rates - which actually matter for the economy - may rise by more than what the Fed currently assumes. This may happen under the pressure of having to fund the sharply higher US budget deficit this year, combined with the Fed unwinding its holdings of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities. Then the Fed would pause because there would be no need to raise the policy interest rate as much. But for the moment this is still a long shot - if anything, the Treasury yield curve is flatter than normal, i.e., the long-term interest rates are depressed relative to the short-term ones.

This all makes it very likely that the March meeting will call for an increase in rates and the Fed will target three to four hikes for the year.  Therefore I assess the odds of less than two at 1%.  Similarly the odds of four or more for the question period is somewhat reduced because it would require either all four before the question period elapsed or a change of outlook to five or more for the year.

Once a worker gives up looking for a job, the government no longer considers him or her unemployed, but instead out of the labor force.\" \"Fed Plans to Raise Rates in 2018 but Lacks Consensus on Frequency\" https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/business/economy/fed-rate-increases.html \"Six of the 16 officials on the Federal Open Market Committee predicted during the December meeting that the Fed would raise rates three times in 2018.

In the past (e.g. 2004/6)  rates have risen in a six month period 4 or 5 times from a historically low rate. The current circumstances are unusual in that the US economy seems to be running close to capacity while government policies seem to be likely to increase demand (e.g. changes to taxes) and/or prices (e.g. increases in import duties).  Import duties on steel and aluminum will likely feed straight thru to increased prices for goods made of steel and aluminum, as it would take some time for US producers to increase production to replace imports (they will probably not increase production much, and are very unlikely to invest in new plants). So an increase in prices would be good for steel and aluminum producers, but the increased prices would reduce demand for the end products (i.e. create inflation and slow the economy). If US tariff increases start a general trade war that would (obviously) be a risk to the US (and world) economy. We don't know if this will happen or not, but its clearly a risk. While this uncertainty lasts I would expect the FOMC to be cautious with rate changes. We know rate changes take about 18 months to effect an economy. The \"trade war\" could be all over in a week, but in the last couple of years we have seen several countries pursuing economic policies that most economists think ruinous so anything is possible. If I were setting rates, last month I might have thought 4 or 5 rate rises in the next year looked about right, the events of this month would have toned it down to 2 or 3 rises, So in six months maybe only 1 or 2, with the caveat that if the \"trade war\" fizzles out more rate rises can be done then.
