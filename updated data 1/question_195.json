A summary from the article: When POTUS tried to implement his executive action on immigration, deferring deportation for undocumented parents of citizens and permanent residents, 26 states sued. The argument was that POTUS was exceeding his executive authority.  The state of Texas also argued that the the executive action would bring unduly burden on the state as it would then have to issue driver's licenses to undocumented people, resulting in expenses for the state. POTUS lawyers had argue the state could simply raise the prices of driver's licences to make up for it.   \"U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen agreed, issuing a preliminary injunction to halt the program\u2019s implementation in all 50 states. Soon after, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit affirmed Hanen\u2019s decision. Then, last June, the SCOTUS deadlocked on the merits of the program, leaving the judge\u2019s ruling in place without actually affirming it. Now, the question is \"can one judge actually block the implementation of a new federal program across the country, even in states that would welcome the program?\"  The new lawsuit argues that it cannot. The lawsuit's plaintiff, New York resident Mart\u00edn Jonathan Batalla Vidal, had received deferred deportation status through the program, but saw that status revoked after Hanen\u2019s decision. \"The problem here, Batalla Vidal claims, is one of standing\u2014the rules governing who can bring a federal case, and to whom a federal court decision applies. Batalla Vidal argues that Hanen\u2019s injunction was \u201cunlawfully broad\u201d because the 26 plaintiff states \u201clacked standing to seek or obtain a nationwide injunction.\u201d  These states may have had standing to halt the program\u2019s implementation within their borders\u2014but they don\u2019t have standing to block the program elsewhere. Texas, which initiated this litigation, argued that undocumented immigrants harm the state by forcing it to help pay for their driver\u2019s licenses. But how is Texas harmed when New York resident Batalla Vidal receives deferred deportation status? Batalla Vidal argues that it isn\u2019t. And if Texas didn\u2019t have standing to block the program in states outside that litigation, then Hanen lacked jurisdiction to halt the program in states that didn\u2019t sue to stop it.\" Apparently, and according to the article, the lawsuit touches on \"basic principles of federalism: One state doesn\u2019t get to control what other states do.  \"Why should Texas get to prevent Batalla Vidal from staying in the country when New York wants to let him remain? The suit also takes advantage of the Supreme Court\u2019s continued deadlock. June\u2019s 4-4 split set no precedent, allowing a different court to arrive at the opposite conclusion of Hanen and the 5th Circuit. If Batalla Vidal can persuade a federal judge in New York to affirm the legality of Obama\u2019s actions, he could probably get his deferred deportation status back. That success would spur lawsuits in every other circuit but the 5th, creating a roadmap for the restoration of the program in nearly half the country. \" This is definitely a case we want to keep an eye on. Although, it is not clear if some states unblocking POTUS' executive order would result in this question resolving as a \"yes.\"   I will increase prob by 15 just in case."], [691, "2016-08-25T20:08:39Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2016-08-25T18:04:33Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-08-24T21:11:47Z", [0.0], "Here's a spanner for the works:  First week in January, Clinton has won the election, Garland or someone more liberal is or will be on the Supreme Court.

Of the three ties, today's deadlock over United States v Texas, a challenge to Barack Obama\u2019s immigration orders, carries the highest stakes. Up to 5m undocumented immigrants who were the intended beneficiaries of Mr Obama\u2019s 2014 executive actions have lost their chance to apply for a programme that would have given them temporary permission to work and relief from deportation. The programme, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA), sought to protect \u201chard-working people who have become integrated members of American society\u201d and to keep families from being wrenched apart. DAPA did not confer legal status and was not a path to citizenship, but it gave people whose children were American citizens or permanent residents a chance to \u201ccome out of the shadows\u201d, pay taxes and live without the constant fear of immigration agents knocking on their doors. Before DAPA could get off the ground, a lawsuit from Texas and 25 other states claiming the programme was illegal presidential overreach led a federal judge in Brownsville, Texas to put Mr Obama\u2019s plans on hold. The injunction, issued in February 2015 by Judge Andrew Hanen, a known hard-liner on illegal immigration, was upheld in a 2-1 decision later that year by the 5th circuit court of appeals. The Supreme Court agreed in January 2016 to review the appeals court\u2019s ruling and heard arguments in April. The tenor of the hearing suggested that the justices were split in two equal camps over whether Mr Obama\u2019s orders were legal. That suspicion was confirmed on June 23rd, when Chief Justice John Roberts announced the court\u2019s one-line ruling: \u201cThe judgment is affirmed by an equally divided Court.\u201d\nhttp://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2016/06/stuck-red Exactly as predicted.

Last year, a federal judge blocked implementation of Pres. Obama's Executive Action on Immigration, which included the DAPA program, on what were called \"narrow technical grounds.\"  A  federal appeals court subsequently blocked it on broader grounds by a 2-1 vote.  The question in front of the SCOTUS now is \"whether the president has the power to temporarily shield the undocumented parents of American citizen children, and give them temporary work permits so that they can support their families for the time being.\" This is a hugely political issue in an election year, and most especially on a year in which one of two presidential frontrunners has made immigration control, and the deportation of 11 million undocumented people, his main platform.   Attorney's for Pres. Obama  argue that \"the president's executive action does not grant citizenship or permanent legal status; it is just a three-year temporary grant of legal status that allows those eligible to work and support themselves and their American citizen children.\"   In the past, SCOTUS has given the executive branch of government \"broad discretion\" over immigration policy, \"including how the law is to be enforced as well as who should be arrested and deported.\"\n\nAnother argument being made on behalf of Pres. Obama is that \"Texas has no legal right to be in court at all because it has not suffered the concrete injury that is required to bring a lawsuit.\" The State of Texas argues that it would certainly sustain \"concrete injury under the president's executive action because the state has a policy of subsidizing driver's licenses, and a large number of people previously considered in the country illegally would be eligible for those licenses if they were granted temporary lawful status by the president's order.\"   The counter argument of the administration says that this is \"a self-inflicted problem for the state, and that Texas is free to charge more for these new driver's licenses if it wishes to.\" SCOTUS is divided along partisan and ideological lines:  http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/18/politics/supreme-court-immigration-executive-actions-texas/  Chief Justice Roberts and Justice  Alito \"seemed particularly concerned with language in the administration's guidance that said the program's recipients would be \"lawfully present,\" which they suggested would contradict immigration law.\" \n Alito: \"How is it possible to lawfully work in the United States without lawfully being in the United States?\" \nRoberts: \"I mean, they're lawfully present, and yet, they're present in violation of the law?\"\nJustice Roberts \"also seemed concerned with the scope of the government's argument defending Obama's moves\": \"Under your argument, could the President grant deferred removal to every unlawful -- unlawfully present alien in the United States right now?\" \n Justice Kennedy suggested that \"the president might have strayed into Congress' territory: \"It's as if -- that the President is setting the policy and Congress is executing it.\" \"That's just upside down.\" Justice Ginsburg noted that \"there are 11.3 million undocumented aliens in the country and Congress has provided funds for removing about 4 million. \"So inevitably, priorities have to be set.\"\nJustice Sotomayor said \"there are not enough resources to deport everyone. \"They are here whether we want them or not.\"  Also noted on the CNN article linked above, the GOP Congress was involved at oral arguments as well. \"The House of Representatives, in an unusual move, intervened in the case against the administration, and had 15 minutes before the eight justices.\" Because of Justice Scalia's death in February, only 8 justices are hearing the case.   A split decision between the four Democratic-appointed justices and four GOP-appointed justices would mean the President's executive action on immigration including the DAPA program, will remain blocked and the case will be sent back to the Texas district court.  The issue of Pres. Obama's fight for his legacy is an important one. I think the administration will do all that it possibly can to get a decision in favor of the President's executive order and subsequent implementation. A lot of resources and energy are being devoted by the Obama administration.  And just as much energy is being devoted on the opposite side specially in an increasingly anti-immigration climate in the US.  I could even see a correlation between Trump's entering into the main stream and getting the GOP to fully support him and SCOTUS deciding against the president's executive action or reaching a split decision.

First, the White House claims that Texas and the other states do not meet the legal threshold to sue the federal government because, among other things, the states could avoid the alleged financial costs by simply choosing not to provide the relevant benefits (e.g., driver\u2019s licenses) court is sympathetic Justice Sonia Sotomayor said there are not enough resources to deport everyone. \"They are here whether we want them or not,\" she said. If a state can sue every time the federal government does something to increase the state's costs, states could sue to challenge almost anything the federal government does,\" he said.\n"], [691, "2016-05-15T13:41:46Z", [0.19], ""], [484, "2016-05-15T01:58:16Z", [0.05], "Down 5% @lsgold7"], [2965, "2016-05-15T00:03:46Z", [0.0], "See United States House of Representatives v.

Given the fact that Congress has allocated funds that allow for deportation of only about 400,000 per year (goal of 4 million), DAPA defines certain illegal immigrants as essentially low priority for deportation. Respondent attempted to make the case that the ancillary benefits for being \"lawfully\" in the country creates a legal status of having access to these benefits that include Social Security, medicaire, etc. There was substantial technical discussion of the word lawful. In non-DAPA regulations, applicable over 30 years, certain administrative regulations use the word lawful, but is not a transferable lawfulness within the meaning of immigration policy. In effect, a person could be here unlawfully for immigration, but given deferred action from DAPA or other Executive Actions in the past, and certain statutory programs such as social security, medicaire, or right to work would independently bestow lawfullness for receipt of their programs' benefits.  The justices, in general, seemed reticent of opening up a new line of court cases simply because a state may have indirect or direct costs due to a Executive order or Congressional action that they politically disagree with. It seemed that the justices were examining scope. Could the designation of low priority deportation be isolated as the main element of DAPA? This would allow a possible suit to challenge the regulation of statutory programs and subsequent benefit application to such a wide class of illegal immigrants, but would also allow a finding in general favor of DAPA. Justices, themselves, could sever the DAPA immigration designation from the benefits issue. p.66 of transcript Official \u00ac Subject to Final Review\nMR.

Congress is not  appropriating money to \u00ac\u00ac to remove more than \u00ac\u00ac what is  it? \u00ac\u00ac four million of them.  So there are these people that are \u00ac\u00ac who are here to stay no matter what. And you have conceded  that the Federal government can say, low priority,  here's your card.

KELLER: And \u00ac\u00ac and DAPA itself purports  to grant not only work authorization, but also transform  lawful conduct into lawful conduct.   JUSTICE GINSBURG: We've already gone  through that. We've \u00ac\u00ac we have agreed that that means tolerated presence. The government has said, take out that word. It was unfortunate that we used it. What we mean is tolerated presence.   p.67   MR. KELLER: But it's not just an unfortunate slip. When they're granting deferred\u00ac action status, under their regulations, that is lawful presence. So they want you to take out \"lawful presence\" from the DAPA memo and pretend \"lawful presence\" isn't in there. But then when you go into the regulations \u00ac\u00ac  JUSTICE KAGAN: But then why aren't you challenging the regulations? I mean, I understand what you're saying that DAPA in some sense triggers the regulations, but only because the regulations say what they say, that your real challenge is not to DAPA, which is the nonenforcement part of this. Your real challenge is to the regulations, the fact that non-enforcement  leads to a certain set of results and yet you're not here challenging those regulations.  MR. KELLER: Well, insofar as you'd conceive of our case of challenging those regulations, it would be challenging them as applied to DAPA, but when Congress \u00ac\u00ac-- JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The problem is that you haven't exhausted administratively, and we always require you to do that.
