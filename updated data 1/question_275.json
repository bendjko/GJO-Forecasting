Voter abstention this year might be factor.   Largest margin of victory in the past 3 decades:   -Reagan defeated Carter in 1980 by almost 10 points. \n-Obama defeated McCain by almost 8 points.\nThese candidates were more popular than Hillary Clinton so I think it is more unlikely, despite Trump's cratering numbers, poorly run campaign and civil war with the GOP.

In todays geopolitical environment that is in such a \"state of flux\", a 10% Margin of Safety is the equivalent of a \"landslide\" victory, a \"virtual certainty\" in political terms\". For example, one the on hand this question forces reconsideration of experience gained through participation on other GJ Qs:\n a) BREXIT; b) SPANISH Qs; c) CORBYN LABOR Q; &, d) US PRESIDENTIAL election Q. One common thread running through each of these events was/is media, pollsters &, so called experts are at best a start, at worst, excellent contrarian indicators.  As with Brexit, UNDERESTIMATING the \"EMTIONAL component\" of the undecided voters was a serious miscalculation to the Remain camp. It had a favorable impact on eventual outcome irrespective of the validity of the various misinformation thrashed out to the public.  Another poignant example: Jeremy Corbyn. Pick up a UK newspaper today, read 95% of Twitter feed, talk with the average London voter and, one reaches only one reasonable conclusion: Corbyn has done a disservice to his Party & is a political loser. YET, he leads the polls, often by a wide margin.  In spite of these above-mentioned facts, however, media in both the UK & US along with so called experts are indeed doubling  down on their original positions over the past few months in spite of being witness outcomes at significant variance with their past publications. The Spanish GJ Q represent the  similar COGNITIVE DISSONANCE  that has upended political prognosis time and again this year. Ditto the Austrian example as well.  All of these events this summer have created a sort of \"SEA CHANGE\" on probability calculations  having substantial impact on their economies. IMPORTANTLY, Merkel's party on Sunday suffered a humiliating 3rd place finish losing by a large margin to the populist AfD a State vote which clearly sets the negative tone for German elections next year as well. http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/09/germany-vote-results-160904164553165.html\n And, the story will continue in Italy, France & Germany for 2017. LOL next year. Conclusion: With each of these experiences in hand, attempting to assign a probability of 10% or more margin of victory to the already complex US electoral process is, the equivalent of making a very aggressive, certain call.  The uncertainty and discontent is NOT a US centric issue. It is a European phenomenon as well.  With the above-mentioned geopolitical uncertainties that remain DIFFICULT to REDUCE, 10% is quite aggressive. Therefor, a cautious more conservative forecast is warranted for the time being.\n"], [1019, "2016-09-04T13:30:51Z", [0.02], ""], [73, "2016-09-04T07:28:51Z", [0.0], ""], [28067, "2016-09-04T04:56:21Z", [0.1], "I expect people will have a hard time picturing Donald Trump as Commander in Chief after the depates."], [1333, "2016-09-04T04:05:22Z", [0.0], "With the exactness of election engineers today and the flight of independents to alternative parties very very likely WILL see this goes to the electoral college then SCOTUS. 10% would be dream come true and personally a 51% win by anyone would restore my faith in the two party system and that would indeed be some trick.
