Although I live elsewhere most of the year, I grew up in Georgia / still spend much of the year there, and I believe I have a deep well of anecdotal observations on what might play out in Nov in GA and the Democratic approach to the South in general. \nI know of two Georgias: Atlanta and the rest of GA (with Savannah and Athens in the middle politically). Atlanta not only is a huge proportion of GA's population, but it also has many people from other parts of the country with more progressive perspectives and lifestyles, a relatively large and politically active African American middle class, and many more African Americans living in poverty and under intense policing. Furthermore, Georgia as a whole has a 31% African American population and a 10% Hispanic population (2010 census). GA has several very large military bases with local communities extremely loyal to the US military. Given Trump's anti-NATO and pro-Putin stances, there is potential for Trump to suffer a low turnout among some of the military communities in GA. Furthermore, his coming out strongly on side of law enforcement on the ongoing cops/ black lives matter debate could see a large turnout for Clinton among both African Americans and progressive whites in Atlanta. And his blatant anti-Mexican jabs makes a golden opportunity for anyone running against Trump to get more of the 10% Hispanic population than any prior election in GA.\nAlthough much of the municipal political leaders in GA cities, including Mayors and national congressmen elected by district, are well represented among African Americans, anyone who lives in GA knows that statewide election outcomes for some reason often do NOT reflect the same diversity. The state as a whole seems to almost always elect a very conservative governor who is almost always a \"good old boy\" well connected to and trusted by the major donors and economic power brokers in the state, many of whom are old money with historic ties and connections throughout the state. \nThen there\u2019s the Clinton factor. I know a LOT of republicans in GA, and I only know of a few who cannot and will not support Trump and none of them will vote for Hillary. If the Democrats had elected ANYONE else, including Bernie Sanders, they would have had a better chance. Democrats simply do not understand the south and how to energize the progressive south. When Kerry picked John Edwards as his running mate as the Democrats\u2019 attempt to win some southern votes, I immediately laughed and wondered how they could not know he has DESPISED among South Carolinians, especially women. Women in South Carolina could tell John Edwards was sleazebag even before the revelation of his amoral behavior in years after the election, and he was headed towards a state election loss when Kerry picked him. Did the Democrats not even do their homework??? I own a business in GA and a few years ago I had a group solar executives from Oregon approached me with a proposal for investing in a solar project in GA. When they arrived at my office, they had a person from GA acting as a local representative to introduce them and to \u201cdo the talking.\u201d As it turned out I have spent much of my life in the USA NW and I was very open to talking with them all, but this should be lesson to Democrats nationwide: you must approach communicating with the south as a different culture because it simply is. Just like you need local representation in China to do business, you need it in the rural and small city south if you are foreign or from an entirely different American culture. Democrats have failed miserably to recognize this.\nIf you listen to southern progressives and actually know them as people (or better yet if you are actually a southern progressive surrounded by conservatives), you learn they are not coming to their progressive views in a such a conservative environment because they are drawn to the PC shaming of Democrats in the media. It borders on cliche, but GA has a \"fighting spirit\" and rebellious, deeply proud code of personal conduct and pride among people who grow up in the rural areas and smaller cities (I saw and lived it as a child and see it today in others who have never really lived outside the state). The GA progressive has this same fighting spirit that is usually seen among its vocal conservatives, and I think in fact southern progressives have it more than most because of how independent you must be to come to and vocalize progressive views in such a conservative environment. It is easy and expected to grow up in these conservative communities believing what your parents or your spouse thinks because it brings acceptance and positive reinforcement on a daily if not hourly level through your conversations at work, socially and at home. So to come from that mosaic of deeply conservative environments and become a progressive is an act of rebellion and resistance to what they see as the people they know well and love just having the wrong beliefs. Instead, the Democrats use PC shaming of the same conservatives who are the very co-community members, coworkers and even FAMILY members of those southern progressives. How is that helping those progressives express, much less convince others, of their views??? Are these lonely progressives supposed to turn on all these people and shame them into changing their views? This is why I belive PC shaming only reinforces existing democrats' views while keeping their viewpoints from actually gaining traction in otherwise mostly conservative communities. Even if they squeak a victory out of this election, the Democrats are not providing an avenue for the growth of progressive viewpoints in conservative places like the south and rural Northwest (places I know intimately well).  Independents and moderate conservatives nationwide that vote for Hillary will do so because of their denunciation of Trump, not because of any belief in Hillary Clinton. Furthermore, the PC shaming approach of Democrats will mean many of these potential swing voters will simply stay home- not enough for Hillary to win GA.\nThis is an unusual reference for this forum, but if you listen to the music of many southern progressives (Allman Brothers, Drive-by Truckers, Widespread Panic etc), you will hear the same anti-establishment spit and fire that you here from conservatives like Newt Gingrich, but in expression of progressive views. Democrats need to learn this and to motivate southern progressives by recognizing they are rebelling against their own conservative surroundings as much as GA conservatives have and seemingly always will tend to rebel against the Democratic party in every forum possible. This is the spirit in the rural and small city southern culture that forms the backbone of resistance to the PC shaming, but this same spirit can be harnessed as a powerful, fresh voice that Democrats would find to be amazingly effective in the South compared to PC shaming from afar. Somehow intertwine that with the Bernie-inspired movement across the rest of the nation, and the Democrats would have something powerful."], [10898, "2016-08-02T19:21:50Z", [0.26, 0.74, 0.0], ""], [14253, "2016-08-02T18:05:40Z", [0.02, 0.98, 0.0], ""], [368, "2016-08-02T17:58:22Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [22070, "2016-08-02T17:57:28Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [12533, "2016-08-02T17:23:39Z", [0.9, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [13998, "2016-08-02T17:19:25Z", [0.28, 0.72, 0.0], "30 as per http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/georgia/"], [15477, "2016-08-02T16:54:25Z", [0.33, 0.67, 0.0], ""], [10916, "2016-08-02T15:46:48Z", [0.85, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [10916, "2016-08-02T15:46:28Z", [0.75, 0.25, 0.0], ""], [4354, "2016-08-02T15:41:15Z", [0.75, 0.25, 0.0], ""], [556, "2016-08-02T14:38:39Z", [0.02, 0.98, 0.0], ""], [691, "2016-08-02T14:24:25Z", [0.22, 0.78, 0.0], ""], [24282, "2016-08-02T11:09:00Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [13997, "2016-08-02T07:07:13Z", [0.4, 0.6, 0.0], ""], [15196, "2016-08-02T06:55:52Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [28000, "2016-08-02T04:41:55Z", [0.48, 0.52, 0.0], ""], [28000, "2016-08-02T04:33:35Z", [0.44, 0.47, 0.09], ""], [10267, "2016-08-02T04:33:23Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [10898, "2016-08-02T02:31:49Z", [0.25, 0.75, 0.0], ""], [23206, "2016-08-01T23:36:17Z", [0.2, 0.8, 0.0], "Georgia has been trending more democratic in recent elections, but polls have still consistently shown Trump with a lead of around 4-5%.
