Broader situation:\nDjukanovic has been PM for much of the past 25 years (1991-98, 2003-06, 2008-10, and since 2012). But True, Djukanovic's party , by itself, just lacks a parliamentary majority (39 out of 81 seats at last election - already over 3 years ago, in Oct 2012), and the formal governing majority is narrow (43 seats - the remaining four representing minority ethnic parties - Bosniaks and Croats - that might be expected to be broadly sympathetic to NATO membership - a probable \"trigger issue\" in the next few weeks). Last presidential election, in 2013, was close, with a member of Djukanovic's party  winning by a very narrow margin (51%-49%) over a candidate from an alliance in which the main \"pro-Russian\" party, NOVA, was a major constituent element.
