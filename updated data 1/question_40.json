At a press conference in Stormont Castle just before 5pm on Tuesday, both Ms Villiers and Mr Flanagan said that the impasse had been overcome. \"The new agreement is designed to implement the various aspects of the Stormont House Agreement from last December, as well as to deal with the impact of continued paramilitary activity. It sets out a strategy to end paramilitarism and paramilitary groups, set up a new high-level cross-border agency to deal with organised crime and border crime and smuggling. The agreement also includes a recommitment by the Government to provide funding for the A5, the road connecting Dublin to the northwest and Derry.\n. . .\n\"The document does not deal with \u201clegacy issues\u201d, one of the key components of the Stormont House Agreement.\n. . . \n\". .  .  a new high-level tripartite task force, involving agencies from Britain, Northern Ireland, and the Republic, will be established to deal specifically with cross-border criminal activity as well as organised crime. . . . there was a commitment to set up a joint agency task force to identity strategic priorities. \"There is also agreement that additional funds of \u00a3500 million will be made available by the British government to address \u201cunique issues\u201d in Northern Ireland, including a programme to remove the \u201cpeace walls\u201d in Belfast. \"The document also paves the way for a full devolution of corporate tax power by 2018. This will mean that the rate in the North will be reduced to 12.5 per cent, the same as the rate in the Republic.\nNew measures are also outlined in the document to deal with the contentious issues of flags and parades. It also gives a commitment to introduce measures to make devolution work better.\n. . . \n\"The DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in have sufficient strength in the Executive and Assembly to drive through the deal.  It will now be for the other Executive parties, the SDLP, the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and the Alliance Party to decide whether or not to acquiesce to the deal. \"This breakthrough should unlock key elements of the Stormont House Agreement, which was put on hold earlier this year after Sinn F\u00e9in and the SDLP refused to agree to welfare changes that they appeared to have originally supported. The deal should safeguard the future of devolution, which was under threat due to an imminent \u201cunsustainable\u201d \u00a3600 million hole in its budget because of the deadlock over welfare reform. It will provide an additional \u00a32 billion in spending powers for the Executive over the coming five years. It will also provide \u00a3600 million over the coming four years to cushion the effects of welfare cuts in Northern Ireland. \" . . .  one [of] the key difficulties being put aside for possible future resolution . . . relates to complaints by Sinn F\u00e9in and the SDLP that the British government could exploit the issue of protecting \u201cBritish national security\u201d to prevent the truth emerging in relation to British state killings and collusion. .  . . an Historical Investigations Unit [which] was to be created to inquire into killings during the Troubles [and] an Independent Commission on Information Retrieval to enable people to privately learn how their loved ones were killed was also to [have been] established [but] such legacy issues are not part of the new agreement.

As the  headline in the NYTimes said, \"The Troubles are Back\".   This piece gives a deeper explanation as to the roots of the crisis.http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/05/opinion/the-troubles-are-back.html?emc=edit_th_20151005&nl=todaysheadlines&nlid=28699183&_r=0 Questions and accusations about who killed whom, and who was behind the killer and the victim have opened the question of the presence/absence of paramilitary organizations like the Provisional IRA and UDF.  The creation, mission, staffing and funding of various \"investigations\" and \"historical fact-finding commissions\" seeking to address \"legacy issues\"  and the existence of paramilitary organizations complicates, dominates, and delays discussion of the other issues of welfare reform,  budget priorities and the implementation of last December's Stormont House Agreement that already had bedeviled Stormont and left it stalemated. Ministerial posts in NI are assigned to parties based on their strength.  The First Minister Peter Robinson  stepped aside in protest when his party failed to get the votes to adjourn the Assembly to address the recent murders, and all but one of his Democratic Unionist Party ministers followed him, resigning. This leaves only 1 more minister than is required for a quorum.   The position of the DUP is that  the Provisional IRA is still active, and Sinn Fein is its political wing, and  because the IRA/paramilitary organizations are illegal, Sinn Fein, therefore,  is a terrorist organization and shouldn't be allowed to participate in government. Neither side wants to see a return to direct-rule from London, but the Irish are stubborn, and they just might shoot themselves in the foot rather than move an inch towards each other. The British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers, has been working her way through a list of positive sounding comments about the talks:  \"open and candid\", \"focused and direct\", \"useful and intensive\"etc.  Methinks she doth protest too much; I suspect that the \"talks\" might more accurately be described as rants. Here's how the NYT reports it: \"If the unionists followed through on a withdrawal from power-sharing, the entire edifice . . . would collapse \u2014 possibly forcing Prime Minister David Cameron to restore direct rule from Westminster. \"Cynical observers reckon that such a calamity is unlikely. They argue that Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Fein politicians have equally come to love their sinecures and won\u2019t easily give them up. Their argument is strengthened by the fact that, despite all, the Democratic Unionist Party continues to attend all-party talks on a way out of the difficulties. What\u2019s certain is that the latest impasse is the most fraught so far. \"The Cameron government bought itself time by appointing a commission to assess the cease-fire status of the I.R.A. and other paramilitary groups. It is scheduled to report in mid-October. \"The fundamental problem is the sectarian basis of the Good Friday Agreement itself, which was originally negotiated between two moderate parties . . . Today, [the moderates in these parties have] been marginalized. . . . \"Mr. McGuigan wasn\u2019t the first person since the signing of the agreement to have crossed the Provos, and paid with his life. At least a dozen have been killed. . . . For an organization like the I.R.A., respect is paramount. \". . . The British, with long experience of winding down \u201cnational liberation\u201d struggles, . . .  know that armed movements that make peace with the imperial enemy must keep back some guns for self-defense, and to ensure a status on par with their contribution to the new dispensation.  This was made plain within a year of the signing of the agreement, when an I.R.A. killing in Belfast was shrugged off in a phrase generally attributed to Britain\u2019s then secretary of state for Northern Ireland, Mo Mowlam, as \u201cinternal housekeeping.\u201d As long as the guns aren\u2019t pointed at police officers or soldiers, the British aren\u2019t bothered. But the Democratic Unionists have never been at ease in office with Sinn Fein. They will comb the commission\u2019s report for justifications to jump ship. The collapse of the agreement need not spell disaster. Sustaining a crisis-ridden system based on separate identities has been an exercise in building and burning bridges simultaneously. Northern Ireland needs a political system based on class and economic interests, rather than on community and identity.\n~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  It sounds to me like Northern Ireland needs a Good Friday Agreement 2.0.

There are said to be more \u201cpeace walls\u201d \u2014 barriers separating Catholic and Protestant neighbourhoods \u2014 in Belfast today than in the 1990s.\n. . . \nOne reason for optimism that a solution will be found to overcome the latest impasse is that Sinn F\u00e9in and the Democratic Unionist party, which together dominate the political landscape, have too much to lose from seeing it collapse. The devolution of power to Northern Ireland, part of a wider move across the UK amid sweeping constitutional changes, has given both parties the motive to retain it. \"John Doyle, head of the Institute for International Conflict Resolution at Dublin City University, says: \u201cThey like the fact that they have power. Devolution is something they would make compromises to keep.\u201d \"The question, though, is whether the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in can find common ground to do so. An unintended consequence of the Good Friday Agreement is that it entrenched Northern Ireland\u2019s sectarian politics. Even as society outside Stormont has become somewhat less sectarian, it is not reflected in the region\u2019s political make-up. \"The DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in have radically differing understandings of the recent history of Northern Ireland. Political experts and historians say there is no common narrative such as unites, for example, the people of England or France, or even the Republic of Ireland. That makes it difficult for the region\u2019s political leaders to agree on what the priorities for Northern Ireland should be, since each party has its own unchanging list.\n"], [38, "2015-10-01T02:11:46Z", [0.59], "http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/business/news/stormont-a-parody-of-government-cbi-boss-tells-our-top-politicians-31556355.html Sept 25. \"Businesses are calling for a new reformed and restructured Executive, as one leader called Stormont a \"parody\" of devolved government.\"\n~~~~~~~\nhttp://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/opinion/editors-viewpoint/northern-ireland-deserves-better-from-our-politicians-at-this-crossroads-31559190.html Oct.  \" . . . this week has been an unedifying spectacle which has done more to poison the atmosphere surrounding the vital all-party talks than advance the prospects of a settlement.\""], [3460, "2015-09-30T22:24:11Z", [0.05], ""], [3455, "2015-09-30T21:50:32Z", [0.05], "With Stormont Elections coming up in May 2016, the DUP may try a bit of brinkmanship as a way of shoring up their base, towards the end of the year (bit more likely early next year).

A suspension of the Assembly benefits the Unionists in that it ties NI to the UK more and doesn't let Sinn Fein maneuver or get credit for successful policies/patronage.  It is also important to remember that the IRA's existence has been plausibly denied for a while by Sinn Fein and that official revelations of its continued existence (not even in continuity groups) is something new. The PSNI and Irish Garda have both acknowledged that the IRA exists and that Sinn Fein cannot wash itself clean of involvement. From a Unionist perspective, this is politically unacceptable and drastic action is called for. The withdrawal of the UUP, the more moderate Unionist Party, is telling. A suspension is also not unheard of. It has happened four times so far, the longest being five years ('02-'07). The shorter, 24-hour ones are also of interest, as they would perhaps be symbolically pursued by Unionist parties that have upped the ante and need some result.
