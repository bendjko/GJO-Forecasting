First of all, the burden of proof for criminal charges is much, much higher than the civil charges which have already been filed. The burden of proof for criminal charges is proof that VW \"intentionally broke the law, beyond a reasonable doubt\". Pursuing charges against individuals may be even more difficult, because in large and complex organizations like VW, it can be tough to prove that certain individuals had knowledge of ongoing fraud. A paper from the DOJ itself described the difficulty of pursuing individual charges, even though those charges can sometimes be the most potent force in taking on large organizations. Additionally, the VW case is much more complex than previous criminal cases which have been brought against automakers. Due to the highly technical nature of the scandal, the DOJ will need extra time to deliberate. A previous GJOpen forecast found that recent investigations for cases brought against automakers last 27 months on average. The VW scandal broke in September, which gives 6 months for a full investigation to complete before the deadline and criminal charges can be brought. Given the complex nature of this case, it is highly unlikely for this case to be so much shorter than other cases. Another area that makes this case more difficult than those brought against domestic carmakers (GM, for example) is that fact that VW is a German company. With ongoing investigations in Europe as well, there is a chance that the DOJ will allow the European authorities to have priority in bringing forward any potential charges. The final confounding factor is a legal loophole- automakers won exemption from criminal penalties in the 1970 Clean Air Act. In order to bring charges against VW, the DOJ will need to go through other methods, such as providing that VW employees intentionally lied to regulators. This further increases the complexity of an investigation. Given the short time frame, complexity of the case, and international element of the scandal, it is extremely unlikely for the US Justice Department to file criminal charges against VW or VW employees. Allowing for a major upset, I find a probability of 1%.

By all accounts a deal was close, but VW was still dragging its feet.  Now it has \"leaked\" that VW's CEO was involved in email chains about the fraudulent activity in 2014.  This happens for a reason.   There is a risk that a criminal charge will be filed as leverage or that VW will have to accept both some criminal charges and a civil settlement (VW's leverage is to say they will not pay any restitution until the criminal matters are resolved).   I still think it is unlikely that the criminal investigation is far enough along by 30 March to have charges filed that soon, but if the purpose is \"leverage\" then the charges could come sooner rather than later.

VW is such an important firm in Germany that it would be a bit shocking for Obama, through the DOJ, to indict VW criminally immediately prior to his trip. I've still heard nothing as to the expected actions of the German prosecutors, but as to this question, I think that if there is a criminal indictment of VW coming, it would make the most political sense for Obama to postpone it until asfter the April trip. Alternatively, the laying of a criminal indictment prior to the trip might be a way for Obama to demonstrate some ability to exercise power over Germany. A problem with this latter strategy is that once such power has been exercised, any leverage it generated is gone. Short answer, Obama trip in April makes this less likely before then.

In the years after the meltdown, several big banks effectively bought their way out of criminal charges by agreeing to pay billions of dollars to government agencies and aggrieved households. And despite widespread fraud, no top bankers were prosecuted. \"Obama administration officials have repeatedly promised that kind of impunity won't continue. \"The case against Volkswagen \"is a perfect opportunity for the Justice Department to live up to its word,\" said Mike Litt, who works on consumer issues for U.S. PIRG, the Federation of State Public Interest Research Groups.  The allegations against Volkwagen are \"truly heinous,\" said Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, a Washington-based advocacy group. In its civil complaint against Volkswagen, the Justice Department accused the company of \"knowingly\" concealing from federal regulators that it had installed software designed to cheat emissions tests in about 580,000 of its diesel cars sold in the U.S. The automaker also \"impeded and obstructed\" regulators' efforts for about a year to learn about the \"defeat device\" that allowed the company to cheat the emissions tests, according to the complaint.\n. . . \n\"Federal prosecutors cited congressional testimony by Michael Horn, chief executive of the automaker's U.S. division, to allege that the company made false statements to state and federal environmental regulators. The Justice Department also used Horn's testimony to allege that Volkswagen's installation of the defeat device in some of its vehicles was a \"knowing and willful decision to deceive.\"\n. . . .\n\"Because of the seriousness of the allegations, \"justice demands a sharp break from the kid-glove, coddling treatment that the U.S. Department of Justice has shown to corporate criminals over the past decade,\" Public Citizen's Weismann added. \"Volkswagen must be made to plead guilty for its crimes...[and] individuals inside Volkswagen must be prosecuted and should be sent to jail.\" \" . . .  it's only a matter of time before federal prosecutors file criminal charges against Volkswagen, say two experts -- one formerly the top environmental crime prosecutor in the country, the other a law professor who has extensively studied the Justice Department's settlements with corporations. \"Criminal charges will follow this year or early next year,\" predicted David Uhlmann, a professor at the University of Michigan law school in Ann Arbor and the former chief of the DOJ's environmental crimes division. \"The Justice Department has fallen down on the job in prosecuting corporate crime over the last two presidential administrations,\" Uhlmann said. \"In major case after major case [the Justice Department] has allowed companies to buy their way out of criminal liability. But that won't happen in the Volkswagen case.... It's just such an egregious case that it warrants both civil and criminal penalties.\"  \"Unlike prosecutors in the Justice Department's criminal division, those responsible for prosecuting environmental crimes have long believed that \"corporations that engage in criminal activity should plead guilty or be convicted at trial, and should not be allowed to escape criminal prosecution by paying large non-criminal penalties,\" Uhlmann added.  \"Uhlmann and Brandon Garrett, a professor at the University of Virginia law school and author of the book Too Big to Jail, listed several likely reasons why the Justice Department first pursued civil claims against Volkswagen rather than criminal charges: \"The Clean Air Act precludes the federal government from seeking criminal penalties against automakers that violate the law by installing defeat devices, Uhlmann said. The civil suit is \"the only way for the Justice Department to address the pollution that has occurred as a result of Volkswagen's misconduct,\" he explained. \"The lying and the fraud is a different matter [which] the government will address with a criminal lawsuit.\"  \"Prosecutors typically file civil suits as soon as they think they have a case in order to obtain additional evidence during the discovery phase of litigation, Uhlmann said. Criminal charges only come after authorities have completed their investigation and generally take much longer because prosecutors want enough evidence to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\nIt's common for the Justice Department to file civil lawsuits before seeking criminal charges, Garrett said. For example, federal prosecutors filed a civil lawsuit against BP eight months after the April 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, but didn't file criminal charges against the company until November 2012. \"Federal prosecutors are probably waiting to file criminal charges against Volkswagen until they first build cases against company employees responsible for Volkswagen's alleged deceptions, Garrett said. The Justice Department's September memorandum calls on prosecutors to \"put individuals first, even if you can file a case against the company right away,\" he noted. Federal prosecutors are probably relying on Volkswagen to turn over evidence that would implicate culpable employees. Companies that don't help prosecutors in their attempt to hold individual employees accountable are likely to face stiffer penalties, he added. Filing criminal charges now could lead Volkswagen to stop cooperating with the Justice Department, Garrett said, costing prosecutors \"their best opportunity to get individuals.\" \"Criminal charges against Volkswagen and its employees are still a possibility, Wyn Hornbuckle, a Justice Department spokesman, suggested to HuffPost.  \"A civil complaint does not preclude the government from seeking other legal remedies,\" he noted. \"The United States' investigation is continuing and will follow the facts and evidence wherever they lead.\" \"But the DOJ's critics are unconvinced.

Therefore, though the German public does not approve VW's cheating, the impression arises that other motivation is driving the potential fine of 90 Billion US$ than environmental concerns. If the US will file criminal charges, that would mean that German chief executives would have to be extradited to US, and bring a real test to the transatlantic relationship - US administration should not test the strained relationship at this time. There is a lot of bad feelings in Europe already in regards to the US's Ukrainian and Middle East politics, and this one could bring a complete revision of the EU partnership to USA, and the EU's union it self.

All I read is that it is possible criminal charges could be filed, but that it would be more difficult for the DoJ to put together a criminal case and win it.   So, then, I got to thinking, if I was president, what would I instruct the DoJ to do?  I would instruct them to get the maximum impact for their expenditure of time & taxpayers' money, and the maximum benefit to the American people.  I would want a real victory, not a pyhrric one that dragged on for decades, providing lifetime employment to lawyers.

A gigantic fine would be indelibly imprinted on the corporate memory of VW and any future temptation would immediately set off alarm bells and trigger negative memories.\n-a criminal case might put a few people behind bars, but would that change the culture at VW?  Nine people who were probably most deeply involved and knowledgeable have lost their jobs already, so what additional good would putting them in jail now achieve?  Wouldn't a gigantic fine do more to change the culture at VW?\n-as to reparation:  what good does it do to jail a few men?  A huge fine could be put to good purposes to further the development of clean energy. I don't know much about how the law works, but I'm thinking that if the DoJ was still considering pursuit of a criminal case, it would use the fact-finding process in the civil case to build a better criminal case, in which case, the criminal case would not be filed for months--or longer--after the civil case.

The ingredients include issuing multiple apologies, especially when called before Congress, and then hiring Kenneth R. Feinberg, who is provided with a virtual blank check to settle claims \u2014 voil\u00e0, the Feinberg Solution.

He has since come to the rescue for BP in response to the gulf oil spill by distributing a $20 billion fund, and General Motors gave him carte blanche to settle injury claims related to defective ignition switches, even allowing payments in cases that had already settled or would have been blocked by the company\u2019s 2009 bankruptcy.

In seven out of 15 cases since 1995 a violation of the Clean Air Act led to a joint EPA and Department of Justice ruling [13]. The 'larger' cases see more involvement by the DoJ. 1b. US Justice Department allready opened multiple investigations: FBI and Environmental and Resource Commission. 1c.  There is a precedent from 2005 with a charge from DoJ and EPA against Volkswagen: 'The U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) today (2005) announced a Clean Air Act settlement with Volkswagen of America, Inc. Under the agreement, filed with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Volkswagen will pay $1.1 million to resolve its failure to promptly notify and correct a defective oxygen sensor affecting at least 326,000 of their 1999, 2000 and 2001 Golfs, Jettas, and New Beetles. This is the largest civil penalty to date for this type of violation [13]. 1d. A deferred charge, as with GM, still contains or requires a criminal charge [www.justice.gov]. Responses from legal GJopen members are welcome on this point. 1e. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is pursuing it's own investigation under the Clean Air Act, with VW using a defeat device [2] under which EPA could press for civil penalty and not criminal penalty. However, The Supreme Court held in Hudson v. United States that the protection against double jeopardy does not bar prosecutors from pursuing criminal charges even if a substantial monetary penalty was already imposed by a regulatory agency. This is important as: 'The Clean Air Act authorizes a criminal prosecution for knowingly making a false statement in an application to the E.P.A. and for tampering with \u201cany monitoring device or method\u201d required for tracking emissions [3].  1f. In addition to the above, a personal investigation could lead to individuals being targeted with an DoJ criminal investigation.  America\u2019s deputy attorney-general, Sally Yates, said that from now on, fining businesses would take second place to pursuing criminal and civil charges against individuals. An accused firm will no longer get credit for co-operating with investigations (as VW says it will) unless it gives the feds the names of every manager or employee involved in wrongdoing, and seeks to gather and submit evidence of their personal responsibility. VW is a test of this new approach [4] [5]. 1g. Even is possible,  it's difficult to prove criminal intent and it's not always possible to bring a case says US attorney Preet Bharara, relating to the GM and Toyota recent settlements [6]. 'Just being the person in charge isn't enough says deputy attorney generl James M. Cole who oversaw many financial prosecutions.  REASONING: very high chance of DoJ filing a criminal charge (either through FBI, resource department or EPA) through focussing on VW, a charge towards one of the employees requires full cooperation with VW, which it says it will provide (and which is pressed for by Angela Merkel), seems smaller but not negligable. Forecast for a criminal charge: 97% 2a. An investigation can take 6 months in GM safety case [2014 - sep2015], Hyundai and Kia about 27 months [2012 -nov2014] and 48 months for Toyota [2010 - March 2014]. [14]\nAverage of recent large cases: 27 months. 2b.  The largest action brought by the Department of Justice on behalf of EPA relating to this defeat device prohibition was the 1998 action against seven manufacturers of heavy duty diesel engines, representing 95 percent of the U.S. heavy duty diesel engine market. However, other significant defeat device cases have been brought [13].  2c. In case of company fraud, cases have been lengthening since the 80s when DoJ took 6 months on average on a decision, which increased to two years on average according to David Freeman Engstrom doj  [7], though this is for all fraud cases.  2c.  One fact is clear and established: Volkswagen used a 'defeat device' which is a violation of the Clean Air Act section 203 [11]. This could shorten case times. 2d. DoJ has a backlog of work and is 'pinched for resources' [7] 2e.  DoJ could await the EPA findings, the seperate prove of California and even the German investigation [9]. Though the last is less likely as the notice of violation under the Clean Air Act is given to Volkswagen AG, Audi AG, and Volkswagen Group of America, Inc and not Volkswagen AG in Germany [10]. 2f.  The technical nature and extend of possible vehicles involved could drive up investigation time. For example, also the light-duty vehicles are investigated by EPA and California's Air Resource Board [8]. RIchard Corey calles the investation 'dogged' [10]. 2g. Full cooperation pledged by Volkswagen, and pressure from the German government, could speed thing up. 2h.  The length could be longer as the EPA first focusses on bringing the affected cars into complience: '\u201cOur goal now is to ensure that the affected cars are brought into compliance, to dig more deeply into the extent and implications of Volkswagen\u2019s efforts to cheat on clean air rules, and to take appropriate further action.\u201d said Air Resources Board Executive Officer Richard Corey [10]. 2i.  In another pathway towards a criminal charge, Der Spiegel alleges that 'at least 30 people at management level in VW knew about the deceit for years', however VW denies this [12]. Forecast for the timing: 27 months starting september Notice of Violation by EPA. Lengthening the time span by 3 months due to extend of the prove, amount of agencies involved, focus on complience first, and the statement of DoJ to start pursuing employees more, which will take more time than a company charge. But not much more seeing the full cooperation by VW and pressure by German government. Forecast: 30 months with standard normal distribution and standard deviation of 9 months would only see a 1% chance. An square distribution would give a 10% chance. Giving the stadard distribution a double weight gives a 4% chance. OVERALL FORECAST: 97% times 4% is 4%. 2.   http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/25/business/dealbook/thepotential-criminal-consequences-for-volkswagen.html?ref=dealbook&_r=2\n3.   http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/c/clean_air_act/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier\n4.  http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21666226-volkswagens-falsification-pollution-tests-opens-door-very-different-car\n5.  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-21/volkswagen-said-to-be-target-of-u-s-criminal-probe-on-emissions\n6.  www.latimes.com\n7.  http://www.mainjustice.com/2011/07/27/length-of-fraud-probes-frustrating-congress-judges-and-attorneys/\n8.  http://www.epa.gov/vw/learn-about-volkswagen-violations#epa\n9.  http://www.epa.gov/vw\n10.  http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/a883dc3da7094f97852572a00065d7d8/dfc8e33b5ab162b985257ec40057813b!OpenDocument\n11.  http://www.epa.gov/vw/laws-and-regulations-related-volkswagen-violations#authorities\n12.  http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/unternehmen/volkswagen-dutzende-manager-in-vw-skandal-verwickelt-a-1057741.html\n13.   http://www.justice.gov/enrd/mobile-sources\n14.  http://www.epa.gov/enforcement/hyundai-and-kia-clean-air-act-settlement"], [13377, "2015-12-20T03:39:15Z", [0.11], ""], [13399, "2015-12-19T22:28:35Z", [0.55], ""], [13389, "2015-12-19T18:58:01Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2015-12-19T14:59:10Z", [0.19], ""], [8967, "2015-12-18T21:47:29Z", [0.05], ""], [498, "2015-12-18T19:35:51Z", [0.03], "Another software-based \"defeat device\" of sorts\nhttp://www.seattlepi.com/news/us/article/Jackpot-fixing-investigation-expands-to-more-6707355.php Are they more prevalent than we think?"], [1545, "2015-12-18T16:52:20Z", [0.15], ""], [13373, "2015-12-18T13:54:03Z", [0.01], ""], [691, "2015-12-18T12:55:16Z", [0.19], ""], [13341, "2015-12-17T21:19:27Z", [0.15], ""], [691, "2015-12-17T12:59:30Z", [0.19], ""], [10949, "2015-12-17T08:03:45Z", [0.06], "\nMy gut feeling say no and that they will let Germany and the EU firstly deal with it alone and that they don't need criminal charges to get the money (fines) they want.

In my question the central point: is VW alone or are US firms doing just the same? It is important because VW diesel represents only 1-2% of the US car fleet whereas US cars (Opel/Ford, etc.) are easily 10-15% of the market share. If DOJ goes all in and the US cars are also \"caught\", then the reprecussion could backfire and also stop the TTIP dicussions completely. A lot on the line.

Prosecutors now are considering alternative legal approaches, such as charging Volkswagen with lying to regulators.\" \"While refineries and other types of major polluters are criminally liable under the Clean Air Act for emissions beyond legal limits, the section of the law that deals with automobiles specifically leaves out any similar provision.\" \"The Justice Department previously has considered charging auto makers that skirted pollution laws, according to people familiar with the matter.

EPA previously has opted for record-setting civil fines rather than criminal charges in the handful of auto pollution cases it has handled. In coming months, state attorneys general will review thousands of VW internal documents, scrutinizing how the company's actions conflicted with state laws. Illinois and New York have already sent subpoenas seeking a range of information.\nFormer Wisconsin Attorney General Peg Lautenschlager cautioned that, despite Volkswagen's early admission of wrongdoing, the case could prove challenging to resolve in a way that satisfies everyone. She said states want to compensate consumers and punish VW \u2014 but not help lead the company into insolvency.\n\"There is a public perception that this is a slam dunk, and there's a notion that they ought to be paying and there are heightened expectations as a result,\" she said. \"But quick resolution isn't necessarily as easy as it sounds.\" Read more: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3280598/States-probe-VW-emissions-look-settlement-money.html#ixzz3uPYULMqc\n"], [102, "2015-12-15T17:23:36Z", [0.11], "https://larswericson.wordpress.com/2015/12/15/monday-night-picks/"], [43, "2015-12-15T15:43:36Z", [0.15], "Responding to forecasts by @gonzo, thank you for your excellent research and light footed ability to alter a forecast.

So: if you're DOJ, do you pull the trigger relatively quickly, or do you drag out negotiations with VW in hopes of getting to a negotiated settlement? There are lots of reasons to wait. You can still file charges later; you can watch to see what develops in Europe and elsewhere; you can add pressure to VW as it copes with the wide set of civil and criminal claims around the world.

This is the first big test of the Justice Dept.'s \"someone has to go to jail\" policy. If they can't pull it off here, nobody will take them seriously. Some thoughts: 1. Jurisdiction is not an issue given the large VW presence in the U.S. They built (at least some of) the cars here, sold the cars here, certified that they met U.S. emissions standards, and use that certification to make their purchasers eligible for U.S. tax credits. The U.S. has jurisdiction seven ways from Sunday.  2. VW is cooperating. When GM purposefully avoided fixing ignition/airbag switches, even they started off initially with \"we have to investigate.\" VW started off with \"we screwed up\" and conceded to halt sales without so much as a whimper. They can't walk back from that now, or do anything that would be perceived as being obstructive. This means that the U.S. will get whatever records it wants, wherever and whenever it wants them.  3. VW cheated, then lied about it. This isn't an improper calibration, a technical defect, or a cost-benefit evaluation that should have gone the other way. This was an intentional (and technically challenging) design of a device and/or software whose only purpose was to detect an emissions test and cheat on it. There's no way that the people who designed it were in any way confused about its purpose or effect, and there's no way that it's legal. And again, we know all this because VW admitted it right off the bat.  4. The WSJ article talks about \"environmental charges\" possibly not being brought. That may be true, but the actions here were so broad and so purposeful that VW and/or it's employees could potentially be implicated for a number of non-environmental crimes, including tax violations for the credits and general fraud charges for lying to a government agency.  5. Before March 30 2016? This is the only area in which I have some doubt. This is a big and complex scheme, and there may be some advantage to waiting until everyone (including other countries) have completed their investigations before bringing charges. I still think that for the value of public perception they will want to bring charges relatively quickly, though it may only involve lower-level employees at first.

The perpetrators are all likely foreign nationals, and as noted in the NYT article, teasing out threads of individual responsibility will take an extended investigation. Also keep in mind that the requirements for the burden of proof will be substantially higher than the civil cases already in process. Thus, a criminal case will be slower to develop. While I have no doubt that criminal charges will eventually be filed, this time frame will be entirely too short, unless we can lasso a black hole and engage in some time dilation!
