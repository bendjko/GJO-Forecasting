The White House said in a statement released late on Monday the preparations by Syria were similar to those undertaken before an April 4 chemical attack that killed dozens of civilians and prompted U.S. President Donald Trump to order a cruise missile strike on a Syrian air base. \"The United States has identified potential preparations for another chemical weapons attack by the Assad regime that would likely result in the mass murder of civilians, including innocent children,\" White House spokesman Sean Spicer said. \"If ... Mr. Assad conducts another mass murder attack using chemical weapons, he and his military will pay a heavy price,\" he said (para 1-4). Assad said in an interview with the AFP news agency earlier this year that the alleged April attack was \"100 percent fabrication\" used to justify a U.S. air strike (para. 8). The strike was the toughest direct U.S. action yet in Syria's six-year-old civil war, raising the risk of confrontation with Russia and Iran, Assad's two main military backers. 'ABNORMAL ACTIVITY' U.S. and allied intelligence officers had for some time identified several sites where they suspected the Assad government may have been hiding newly made chemical weapons from inspectors, said one U.S. official familiar with the intelligence (para. 8-10).

The threat marks an escalation of tensions between the United States and the Syrian government and its backers over control of Syria's southeastern frontier with Iraq, where Washington has been training Syrian rebels at a base inside Syrian territory as part of its campaign against Islamic State. The area is seen as crucial to Assad's Iranian allies and could open an overland supply route from Tehran to Iraq, Syria and Lebanon - the \"Shi'ite crescent\" of Iranian influence that is a major concern to U.S.-allies in the region. Tensions have been growing in southeastern Syria over the last several weeks. The United States launched air strikes on Tuesday against what it said were pro-government forces who it said posed a threat to U.S. and U.S.-backed forces in the area, the second such air strike in three weeks. The statement from the pro-Assad alliance was issued in the name of the \"commander of the operations room of the forces allied to Syria\", and was circulated by a military news unit run by the Lebanese group Hezbollah, one of Assad's military allies. The statement did not spell out whether Russia, Assad's most powerful ally, was a signatory. Speaking in Baghdad, a U.S. envoy said the United States was counting on regular contacts with Moscow to help avoid a conflict with pro-Damascus forces in the southeastern region known as the Badia. Separate remarks by Syria's foreign ministry, carried by state TV, warned of the \"dangers of escalation\" and demanded the U.S. coalition stop strikes on Syrian soil. The statement from the \"allies of Syria\" said attacks on U.S. forces could be carried out with \"different missile and military systems, in the light of the deployment of American forces in the region\". \"America knows well that the blood of the sons of Syria, the Syrian Arab Army, and its allies is not cheap, and the capacity to strike their positions in Syria, and their surroundings, is available when circumstances will it,\" the statement said (para. 1-9).

The Pentagon, which has sought to stay out of Syria's civil war to instead focus its firepower on Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq, carried out a similar strike on May 18 that was denounced by Damascus. A Syrian military source said the strike had caused deaths and material damage and showed the coalition was \"in support of terrorism\". The Syrian military command warned against the dangers of escalation, the source added. In recent days, the U.S. military has repeatedly warned massing forces to stay away from a so-called \"de-confliction\" zone near a garrison used by American special forces and U.S.-backed fighters around the southern town of At Tanf. The zone was agreed with Russia, Syrian President Bashar al Assad's ally. Assad is also backed by Iran and Shi'ite militias. \"Despite previous warnings, pro-regime forces entered the agreed-upon de-confliction zone with a tank, artillery, anti-aircraft weapons, armed technical vehicles and more than 60 soldiers,\" the U.S.-led coalition said in a statement. It said the United States, via a military hotline with Russia, issued several warnings before the strike, which destroyed two artillery pieces, an anti-aircraft weapon and damaged the tank. A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the strike was carried out by manned, U.S. aircraft. \"The Coalition does not seek to fight Syrian regime or pro-regime forces but remains ready to defend themselves if pro-regime forces refuse to vacate the de-confliction zone,\" the statement said. Still, the incident showed that the area around the Tanf garrison in southern Syria was under growing pressure (para. 1-10). Stewart, P. (2017).

The two leaders spoke by phone for the first time since U.S. relations with Russian were strained by the U.S. attack on a Syrian airfield. They two leaders set the foundation for what could be their first face-to-face meeting in July. Statements from both the White House and the Kremlin suggested the two leaders had a productive conversation that included North Korea and fighting Islamist militants throughout the Middle East. A senior Trump administration official said Putin had requested the call and described it as an effort to present his ideas for Syria. Trump ordered 59 cruise missiles launched in retaliation for a chemical weapons attack that the United States blamed on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The attacked prompted protests from Assad ally Russia, which blamed Syrian rebels for the use of outlawed nerve gas and said Assad was not at fault. The White House said the two leaders agreed that \"all parties must do all they can to end the violence\" in Syria. \"The conversation was a very good one, and included the discussion of safe, or de-escalation, zones to achieve lasting peace for humanitarian and many other reasons,\" a White House statement said. Trump during his presidential campaign last year frequently said he wanted safe zones established for Syrian refugees, paid for by Gulf states, to alleviate any need for the refugees to move elsewhere, including to the United States. Candidate Trump had also expressed a desire for a U.S. alliance with Russia to fight Islamist militants, a goal that has been elusive since he took office on Jan. 20. With a ceasefire ever elusive in Syria, the White House said Washington would send a representative to ceasefire talks in Astana, Kazakhstan, on Wednesday and Thursday. The State Department said acting Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs Stuart Jones will attend as an observer. The decision to send Jones to the talks, even as an observer, is an indication that the United States is taking the Astana talks more seriously. Previously, the U.S. ambassador to Kazakhstan George Krol had attended the talks as an observer.

The United States launched dozens of missiles earlier this month against a Syrian air base in response to a chemical attack that killed 90 people, including 30 children. It says the Syrian government launched the attack from the Shayrat air base. The Pentagon has said that the strike had damaged or destroyed about 20 percent of the Syrian military's operational aircraft. During a press conference alongside his Israeli counterpart, Mattis was asked whether the Syrian military had moved warplanes to a Russian base in Latakia. \"They have dispersed their aircraft, no doubt. They have dispersed their aircraft in recent days,\" Mattis said. Mattis also reiterated that the United States believed Syria had retained some chemical weapons. \"The bottom line is, I can say authoritatively they have retained some (chemical weapons). It's a violation of the United Nations Security Council resolutions, and it's going to have to be taken up diplomatically,\" Mattis said. Israel's military said on Wednesday it believed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces still possessed several tonnes of chemical weapons.

US President Donald Trump, who was initially resistant to the idea of becoming involved in Syria, radically changed his stance following the chemical attack and said the strike was \"in the vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons.\" \"Tonight, I call on all civilized nations to join us in seeking to end the slaughter and bloodshed in Syria and also to end terrorism of all kinds and all types,\" Trump said Thursday, when the attack took place in Eastern Time. The Kremlin and the Syrian government, which have worked together during Syria's civil war, were quick to condemn the attack, with Moscow calling the attack an \"aggression against a sovereign state in violation of international law, and under a false pretext.\" Many other nations, however, have praised the US's intervention. Here's a list of the reactions of those who were in favour and those who condemned the strike: In favor United Kingdom: Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said the UK government gave its full support to the US over the attacks, saying the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime in Syria passed a clear red line in international law. \"The American Defense Secretary Jim Mattis consulted me early yesterday evening about our assessment of the regime's culpability for the chemical weapons attack and we reviewed the need to understand and to deal with any likely Russian reactions to the attack,\" Fallon told the BBC (para. 1-8).

Jaffe (2017) Thu Apr 6, states that: For President Trump, choosing targets and launching cruise missiles to punish the Syrian regime for using chemical weapons this week may have been a relatively clear-cut decision. The big problem is what comes next. The military had been preparing options for a strike against President Bashar al-Assad since well before 2013, when the Syrian dictator killed more than 1,000 of his own people in a devastating nerve gas attack. A chemical attack Tuesday blamed on the Assad regime killed scores of civilians and triggered a response from the Pentagon, which launched approximately 50 cruise missiles at a Syrian military airfield late on Thursday. \u201cThe basic questions haven\u2019t changed,\u201d said Phil Gordon, a senior official in the Obama White House who took part in many earlier debates about how to punish Assad. \u201cIs there a set of military strikes that you can use to degrade the Syrians\u2019 ability to deliver chemical weapons and, if you do that, what do they do in response?\u201d The biggest difference between 2013, when President Barack Obama last threatened airstrikes against Assad, and today is that the risks of widening the conflict are much greater. The initial American war plans to punish Assad in 2013 were aimed largely at his chemical weapons capability, said former U.S. officials involved in those deliberations. A direct strike on the Assad regime\u2019s chemical weapons storage facilities was seen as too risky to civilians, because it would have produced a plume of noxious gas. Instead military planners drew up a target list that included Assad\u2019s chemical weapons units and the aircraft and artillery that the regime would need to deliver the ordnance. \u201cThe intent was to strike the various chemical weapons units,\u201d said a former U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss military planning. \u201cWe had postured our intelligence units to give us bomb damage assessments \u2014 and if we didn\u2019t get the effect we were looking for, we would have hit them again.\u201d The biggest difference that Trump and his commanders confront now is the presence of Russian troops on the battlefield and Russian air defense systems that are capable of shooting down U.S. planes. Today, Russian troops are intermingled with Syrian forces, and any strike on a Syrian military target could also produce Russian military casualties (para. 1-8). Jaffe, G. (2017).

For Trump, this would have the advantage of telling the Iranians he means business elsewhere, and curtailing Iranian power; for Putin it would have the advantage of curtailing Iranian power and giving him that much more leverage in the region, since Assad's other principal backer would be weakened, and still in the U.S. cross hairs. Moreover, Trump might be able to rely on Putin to get Assad to behave himself; it's hard to believe that the Iranians are a force for restraint in Syria. And for Assad, it would actually be punishment, since he relies so heavily on Iran for combat capability, but an anti-Iran strike wouldn't compromise his grasp on the territory that he already holds, and the strike would not actually harm Assad's Syrian backers. So in a way, everybody would have something to gain by a U.S. anti-Iran strike, except of course Iran.

Deeper U.S. involvement or a military response could heighten tension with Russia, a regime ally, and complicate the fight against Islamic State that Mr. Trump has prioritized. Hours after Mr. Trump spoke, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson urged Russia to abandon its support for Mr. Assad. Last week, he and other administration officials indicated the U.S. expected Mr. Assad would remain in power.

The U.S. military had airlifted allied Syrian Arab militia fighters near Tabqa, providing them fire support in a move aimed at retaking a major dam that remains in the hands of Islamic State, also known as ISIS, the Pentagon said at a news conference in Washington. U.S. troops took part in the operation, at least flying to the site. Colonel Joseph Scrocca, a coalition spokesman, declined to say whether U.S. advisers were on the ground, but left open that possibility. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a militia alliance including Arab and Kurdish fighters, said the operation also aimed to block any advance by Syrian government forces from the west. Islamic State captured the Tabqa Dam, also known as the Euphrates Dam, and a nearby major air base at the height of its expansion in Syria and Iraq in 2014. It is located about 40 km (25 miles) to the west of Raqqa city. The campaign to capture Raqqa appears to be gathering pace as an overlapping, U.S.-backed effort in Iraq is drawing closer to driving Islamic State from Mosul. A local official familiar with SDF operations said the airdrop took place on Tuesday. The SDF, which includes the powerful Kurdish YPG militia, is fighting to encircle Raqqa city with support from the coalition, including air support and backing on the ground from U.S. special forces. Scrocca said Apache helicopters, Marine artillery, U.S. special operations forces and air strikes were involved in the operation. About 75 to 80 percent of the forces were members of the Syria Arab Coalition, and Kurds were among the remainder, he added.

Assad has said he saw promise in Trump's statements emphasizing the battle against Islamic State in Syria, where U.S. policy under President Barack Obama had backed some of the rebels fighting Assad and shunned him as an illegitimate leader. \"We haven't seen anything concrete yet regarding this rhetoric,\" Assad said in an interview with Chinese TV station Phoenix. \"We have hopes that this administration in the United States is going to implement what we have heard,\" he said. The United States is leading a coalition against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. In Syria, it is working with an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias. Their current focus is to encircle and ultimately capture Raqqa - Islamic State's base of operations in Syria. This week, the U.S.-led coalition announced that around 400 additional U.S. forces had deployed to Syria to help with the Raqqa campaign and to prevent any clash between Turkey and Washington-allied Syrian militias that Ankara sees as a threat. Asked about a deployment of U.S. forces near the northern city of Manbij, Assad said: \"Any foreign troops coming to Syria without our invitation ... are invaders.\" \"We don't think this is going to help\". Around 500 U.S. forces are already in Syria in support of the campaign against Islamic State. Assad said that \"in theory\" he still saw scope for cooperation with Trump, though practically nothing had happened in this regard. He dismissed the U.S.-backed military campaign against Islamic State in Syria as \"only a few raids\", and said a more comprehensive approach was needed (Para. 1-10). Perry, T. (2017).

Erdogan, referring to Islamic State's remaining stronghold, told a joint Moscow news conference with the Russian President \"Of course, the real target now is Raqqa\". \nTurkey is seeking a role for its military in the advance on Raqqa, but the United States is veering toward enlisting the Kurdish YPG militia - something contrary to Ankara's aim of banishing Kurdish fighters\u2019 eastwards across the Euphrates river. Turkey considers the YPG the Syrian arm of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) that has been fighting an insurrection on Turkish soil for 30 years. Washington, like Ankara, considers the PKK a terrorist group, but it backs the YPG. Russian-backed forces of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad are also operating in the north of the country, close to Turkish borders. Washington and Moscow are concerned fast-moving military developments could lead to serious clashes between Turkish forces and the YPG. \"It should now be accepted that a terrorist organization cannot be defeated with another one,\" Erdogan said, referring to the enlistment of YPG by the United States to fight Islamic State. \"As a country that has been battling terror for 35 years, terrorist organizations like Daesh (Islamic State), the YPG, Nusra front and others are organizations we face at all times\u201d (para. 1-7).

With the self-styled caliphate rapidly shrinking in Iraq after the loss of much of Mosul, the fall of Raqqa and Islamic State\u2019s remaining territories in Syria has become just a matter of time. The contest over who gets these spoils, however, threatens to unleash a new spiral of violence that could draw regional and global powers deeper into the conflict. The three forces aiming for Raqqa\u2014Sunni Arab rebels, the Syrian regime and Kurdish-led militias\u2014all view control over that area as giving them crucial leverage in any political settlement of the war. The complicated dynamic is further muddled by the strategic calculations of their main sponsors, whose own interests extend far beyond the power struggle inside Syria. Turkey, the main supporter of the rebel Free Syrian Army and allied Sunni Arab militias, is most interested in weakening the main Syrian Kurdish political faction, which is affiliated with the PKK, or Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party. The PKK is waging a violent campaign inside Turkey and is considered a terrorist group by Washington and Ankara alike. For Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who sent troops to fight alongside the FSA in northern Syria last August, winning the April 16 referendum on vastly expanding his own powers represents an even more important priority. He has little to gain in the referendum campaign from a dramatic escalation of the Syrian conflict. For the Syrian regime\u2019s main backer Russia, which has developed ties with the Syrian Kurds and, of late, with some Sunni Arab rebels, the main goal is to capitalize on its costly investment in Syria and to cement the achievements of its military campaign through a political deal. The Trump administration, meanwhile, is still reviewing its Syria policy. Its actions, for now, remain driven almost exclusively by the military priorities in the battle against Islamic State, with limited attention to America\u2019s other interests and alliances in the region. Recent events in the northern Syrian city of Manbij, seized by the U.S.-backed Kurdish forces from Islamic State in August, highlight just how volatile the situation has become. Syrian regime and Kurdish offensives against Islamic State last month in the area effectively blocked Turkey and its Sunni proxies from heading toward Raqqa (para. 1-9). Trofimov, Y. (2017).

The deployment marks a new escalation in the U.S. war in Syria, and puts more conventional U.S. troops in the battle. Several hundred Special Operations troops have advised local forces there for months, but the Pentagon has mostly shied away from using conventional forces in Syria. The new mission comes as the Trump administration weighs a plan to take back Raqqa, the so-called capital of the Islamic State, that also includes more Special Operations troops and attack helicopters. The force is part of the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit, which left San Diego on Navy ships in October. The Marines on the ground include part of an artillery battery that can fire powerful 155-millimeter shells from M777 Howitzers, two officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the deployment.

Air raids and artillery hit three towns in Eastern Ghouta, part of Syria's Damascus province, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. A ceasefire had been agreed in the area until March 20, Russia's Defence Ministry said on Tuesday.\nThe Syrian air force struck at jihadists linked to a former al Qaeda offshoot in Irbeen, a city north-east of Damascus in Eastern Ghouta, and in al Qaboun, closer to the center of the capital, according to a media unit of Hezbollah, a Damascus ally. There was no immediate comment from the Syrian military. At least 30 air raids hit the region on Wednesday, along with dozens of artillery rounds and ground-to-ground missiles fired from government-held areas, a rebel and a resident said.\nThe Syrian army has been closing in on eastern suburbs of Damascus still in rebel hands, such as Qaboun, and seeking to storm neighboring towns in Eastern Ghouta. Air raids and fighting have escalated in recent days, opposition sources said. The army and its allies are trying to force rebels to agree to truces similar to those that have led to the evacuation of thousands of opposition fighters to northern Syria. The army has for the last 20 days concentrated its air strikes on Qaboun district, effectively ending a ceasefire that rebels in the area agreed with the Syrian army which had been in place since the end of 2013 (para. 1-7).

The class had just finished a two-week training course run by U.S. Army Special Forces soldiers and SDF trainers in the hollowed-out shell of this tiny village in northern Syria, which was pulverized during a fierce fight last year between the SDF and retreating Islamic State fighters. The militiamen \u2014 until recently students, laborers, and family men \u2014 quickly grabbed their new rifles and embraced their new job, forced on them by forces beyond their control. Several of them said they would gladly go back to their civilian lives once the fighting stopped, but that the Islamic State and Turkey were threats they couldn\u2019t ignore. For the Americans, providing weapons and basic combat skills to the young fighters is the easy part of their mission. The ethnic politics of arming local forces presents a more daunting challenge. The U.S. military maintains a light footprint in northern Syria, with small teams operating four training centers to funnel Kurdish and Arab forces into the fight for the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa, and to protect gains the Kurds have made in the north around the nearby city of Manbij. Other U.S. forces are closer to the fight in Raqqa, accompanying the SDF in their move on the city, and helping call in airstrikes on Islamic State positions. Overall there are about 500 U.S. troops in the country.\nNortheast of the training range near the city of Kobani on the Turkish border, U.S. forces have constructed a hardened landing strip for C-130 and C-17 cargo planes full of equipment for the Syrian Arab forces and to supply U.S. troops operating throughout the north. The head of U.S. Central Command, Gen. Joseph Votel, and the commander of U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria, Lt. Gen Stephen Townsend, visited the site on Friday along with a few reporters for a first-hand look. The site promises to be a key hub in the fight to retake Raqqa and in the continuing effort to build up the SDF, which is growing week by week as U.S. soldiers move them through the training program. As of now, the Arab part of the SDF \u2014 the Syrian Arab Coalition \u2014 numbers about 23,000 fighters, while the battle-hardened Kurdish contingent makes up the remaining 27,000. That imbalance is an issue in the Raqqa campaign, and in the U.S. debate whether to supply arms to the Kurds, or only to the Syrian Arabs. The Trump administration has yet to announce a decision on whether it will provide weapons to the Kurdish forces, and how it comes down the issue could shape the course of the war and Washington\u2019s relations with Ankara. One of several options on the table is increasing the number of U.S. troops in Syria, perhaps even with conventional forces that could provide more help in capturing Raqqa (para. 1-10). McLeary, P.

The United Nations opened the peace talks with a symbolic ceremony on Thursday in Geneva, attended by representatives of the warring sides. But there has been no further direct contact with U.N. mediator Staffan de Mistura, who is still trying to get agreement on how the talks should be arranged. With tensions palpable among participants, the United Nations is treading carefully in its efforts to revive negotiations after a 10-month hiatus.\n\"Every time we have talks, or negotiations, there is always someone who tries to spoil,\" de Mistura told reporters before meeting the government delegation. \"I am expecting (it),\" he said. A ceasefire brokered by Russia and Turkey with Iran's support is increasingly violated with groups opposed to the truce and the Geneva process also attempting to force their collapse. Suicide bombers stormed two Syrian security offices in Homs on Saturday, killing dozens with gunfire and explosions including the head of military security, prompting airstrikes against the last rebel-held enclave in the western city. [L8N1GA03U] The jihadist rebel alliance Tahrir al-Sham, which opposes the talks - although it has fought alongside factions that are represented there - said that five suicide bombers had carried out the attack. It celebrated with the words \"thanks be to God\" but stopped short of explicitly claiming responsibility.\nTahrir al-Sham was formed this year from several groups including Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, which was formerly known as the Nusra Front and was al Qaeda's Syrian branch until it broke formal allegiance to the global jihadist movement in 2016.

Rebel officials said that no official explanation had been given for the move this month following the jihadist assault, though several said they believed the main objective was to prevent arms and cash falling into Islamist militant hands. But they said they expected the aid freeze to be temporary. The halt in assistance, which has included salaries, training, ammunition and in some cases guided anti-tank missiles, is a response to jihadist attacks and has nothing to do with U.S. President Donald Trump replacing Barack Obama in January, two U.S. officials familiar with the CIA-led program said. The freeze reflects the troubles facing Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebels in the almost six-year-old revolt against Assad, who now appears militarily unassailable in his core western region largely thanks to direct intervention on his side by Russia and Iran. \"The reality is that you have changes in the area, and these changes inevitably have repercussions,\" said an official with one of the affected FSA rebel groups. He said no military assistance could \"enter at present until matters are organized. There is a new arrangement but nothing has crystallized yet\". The support funneled to vetted FSA factions has included contributions from Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia - states that have opposed Assad. It is one of several foreign aid channels to rebels. Others still function. The CIA declined comment on the reported freeze in support. A Qatari official said his government had nothing to say on the matter. Turkish officials said only they could not discuss \"operational details\". There was no word from Saudi Arabia. Reuters confirmed the freeze with officials from five of the FSA groups that have been recipients of financial and military support from the so-called \"MOM operations room\". It was also confirmed by two other senior FSA figures briefed on the matter.\nThey spoke on condition of anonymity given the covert nature of the CIA-backed program and the sensitivity of the subject. Several rebels believed the aid halt was temporary, with new arrangements expected, but there was no clarity yet. Confirming the freeze, two senior FSA sources said donor states were aiming to send the aid to one, unified fighting force - a coherence that has eluded rebels throughout Syria's civil war. One of the FSA officials said he did not expect the rebels to be abandoned as they represent the best hope for blocking a further expansion of Sunni jihadist influence in Syria, and to fight back against the growing role of Iran there (para. 1-11).

The clash on Thursday near the IS-held city of al-Bab underlined the risk of the parallel offensives igniting new fighting between the government and its rebel enemies. \nRussia and Turkey have backed opposing sides in the war but recently started cooperating over Syria, brokering a truce between government forces and rebels and working together to try to revive peace talks. \nRebel officials said the clash took place in a village southwest of al-Bab. An official in a military alliance fighting in support of the Syrian government confirmed a clash had taken place. \"The Russians intervened to control the situation,\" said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity. \nPresident Bashar al-Assad is supported in the war by the Russian military and an array of Iranian-backed militias. \nTwo rebel officials accused the government forces of provoking the incident.

They don't need safe zones at all.\"\n\"It's much more viable, much more practical and less costly to have stability than to create safe zones.\"\nAssad said safe zones would be at risk of attack from armed groups.\nThe United Nations also rejects safe zones, saying conditions in Syria, where battles rage on between multiple sides, are not suitable (para. 1-9).

For purposes of this question, even though it's only one editorial, it faithfully conveys an idea that is surely widespread: Assad is a criminal, and the U.S. cannot deal with him. The piece ends by saying: \"Trump\u2019s obsession with defeating the Islamic State is not misguided. The group absolutely poses a severe threat to international stability. It\u2019s a question of proportionality. Assad\u2019s record for inflicting terror and supporting it in other countries certainly deserves Trump\u2019s equal condemnation.\" The editorial is actually rather idiotic, since it calls attention to Trump's rhetoric about destroying ISIS, and then calls for condemnation of Assad. So what's their prescription? Destroy ISIS but be satisfied to condemn Assad? Commence military operations against Assad, the same way we will with ISIS, since he's just as bad? Do nothing?  If they're not clear on what action they're calling for, it's because they don't know themselves. But I think this is a good example of the moral hazard associated with international criminal law: people in St. Louis, Missouri, or London, or Washington DC can demand that Assad \"not be allowed to get away with it\" while people in Syria are blown to pieces in a war that could conceivably last for another generation or two. And I would say that it's too late to backtrack and offer guarantees to Assad that he won't be prosecuted. He would never believe it, and he would be right; people like Amnesty International would do everything in their power to to have any such guarantee rescinded after he left Syria. (Regarding the editorial, nice touch calling Trump's vow to defeat ISIS an \"obsession;\" since we live in an age where everything is pathologized, why not imply that Trump's ambition to destroy the home base of an international terrorist organization is somehow less than healthy?)"], [498, "2017-02-09T18:36:38Z", [0.55], "U.S. Representative Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) recommends engaging with Assad\nhttp://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/02/08/gabbard_any_hope_for_peace_in_syria_means_engaging_with_assad.html \"What many people don't know is that really since 2011-12, our government has been quietly providing arms, money, intelligence and support, both directly and indirectly to militant groups who are partnered with... and working with ISIS and other terrorist groups.\" Similar to the logic often used by @rjfmgy, I'm not sure that such a pronouncement will move the U.S. any closer to engagement. While true, there won't be a truth commission, there will be no confessions, the CIA will continue to follow the Stratfor Doctrine of co-option by way of corruption, and using this rationale to even partially justify engagement with Assad will cause such resistance that engagement is actually less likely. Long ago, on a thread for a different proposition, when I was promoting the idea that Trump should pick a Democratic VP (e.g., Marcy Kaptur), another forecaster suggested Gabbard as the Vice-Presidential candidate.

The negotiations will undoubtedly set the tone and agenda for future talks (para.14).\n\"Vladimir Putin's rush to establish a new political framework through organizing Syria peace talks in the Kazakh capital are primarily designed to cement the Kremlin's position as the architect of a political solution,\" said Ayham Kamel, Middle East and North Africa director at Eurasia Group (para.14- 15). Al-Saleh said the ceiling for talks is to reinforce the cease-fire, open humanitarian corridors for besieged areas and create a mechanism to hold violators to account. \"Meanwhile, we are waiting for the U.S. to change its position,\" he added (para.20). Another aim of Russia is to separate the rebels from the al-Qaida-affiliated Fatah al-Sham group, which Moscow insisted on excluding from the cease-fire. The front is one of the most powerful groups and maintained close alliances with most of the other rebels at times of intense confrontations with pro-government forces.\nDisassociating with the front at a time of dwindling support could spell the end for many of the myriad armed groups. It also could spark tensions among the rebels.\n\"You can't ... try to drag the Syrian people toward a fourth front,\" said al-Youssef of the al-Zinki group, suggesting that giving up on the Fatah-al-Sham Front would further complicate the war and spell more radicalization.\nAl-Zinki is one of the few groups that won't take part.\nAnother powerful group, Ahrar al-Sham, said it also won't participate in the talks because, among other things, excluding Fatah al-Sham is an attempt to divide the rebels.\nIf there are \"good results,\" the group said it will support the talks.

(2) will the US endorse such a plan, by July 1?  The rebels - those who participate in the talks - have every reason to be suspicious of Assad, but they are not being supported by anyone now (except Turkey), so they would probably have to play along. They could, however, insist on (a) trust-building measures, such as zones free of the regime's troops, and (b) the involvement of the UN rather than just the Russia/Turkey/Iran/Assad group. This would slow the discussions, but probably not derail them. The UN is also eager for a peace process after nearly 6 years of fighting, and the regime could easily promise some measures that can be easily reversed. Still, it will be a bitter pill for the opposition to swallow Assad's remaining in power, so I expect the talks to drag (i.e., no plan yet after the meetings in Geneva in February, let alone Astana next week).  The US position is unclear yet. They don't mind peace in Syria, and would like to take some credit for that by playing along perhaps, but directly sitting on the table with Iran will be awkward. Yet they will be in the Geneva talks I presume, both in the February round and beyond.

They are modeled on U.S. special-operations units\u2014who also have a presence in Syria.\nThe presence of Russian special forces underscores the strategic importance for the Kremlin to make sure Aleppo is firmly in the hands of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad before the allies seek to restart any negotiations on Syria\u2019s future. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday that following the success of Syrian forces it was time to pursue a peace agreement (para. 1-5). Grove, T. (2016).

The group seized the city in 2014, partially destroying a number of its world-renowned archaeological sites.\nThe recent militant offensive drove Syrian government troops almost completely from the city on Sunday. The Islamic State-linked news agency Amaq later posted images of Syrian and Russian equipment left behind by the retreating troops. One video shows the remains of a Russian forward operating base that had been established after the city was first retaken in March and was used to help with demining efforts there (para. 1-3). Images posted online Tuesday by the group also depicts fighters seizing what looks like a Syrian fire base to the west of the city. An independent researcher who runs a website that documents the Syrian conflict, puts the base just north of the government-held Tiyas air base. Images taken by the Islamic State show abandoned artillery pieces, machine guns and, in the background of one of the photos, the outline of what looks like an S-125 surface-to-air missile system and its associated targeting and tracking radar (para. 7).\nThe S-125, known as a SA-3 to NATO countries, is a Soviet-era weapon that can hit targets flying at approximately 60,000 feet, and has a maximum effective range of 17 miles, according to U.S. military documents. It can be configured to fire two or four missiles from its rail system. If properly used, it could pose a threat to any aircraft flying in the area; however, systems such as the S-125 are complicated to use and are easily seen and targeted from the air (para. 7- 8).

Amidst the eschatological angst, it is important at least to start by noting that \u2014 as every president has had to discover \u2014 he (and someday she) is just one person. Even an aligned Congress can act as a brake on some of the more lunatic or destructive policies, as will the very machinery of government. Besides, Trump gives little evidence of being details-oriented or having any clear sense of a vision, which will mean that he may well prove more willing to let the machine grind along, so long as he gets enough photo ops and adulatory mentions. Yes, there is no question that a Trump presidency will have serious, dangerous implications, but here the very framing of the US political system \u2014 designed, after all, to make executive power hard to apply \u2014 and his own limitations may be useful.\nIt\u2019s winter in Central Europe. Whether or not Trump actually means anything he said, especially his backpedalling from US commitments to the defence of NATO allies, nonetheless this must be a real concern in the Baltics and Central Europe. Ultimately, there is no reason to believe Russia has any territorial designs on NATO states, but it will, if it feels it has the chance, bully and intervene. More to the point, Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova, even Belarus are going to have to come to terms with a future in which they are unlikely to be able to count on serious Western support and protection. Putin may have pushed for a Yalta 2.0 division of Europe, but this election essentially hands him the half of that deal he wanted, by default.\nThe Kremlin\u2019s glee must be tinged with a degree of nervousness. Nonetheless, the Russians never expected Trump to win, and their calculus was based on trying to ensure a Clinton presidency was weakened from the gate. Yes, Trump has been bizarrely positive about Putin and there is the possibility of a Putin-Berlusconi-type mutual man-crush as ageing, soi disant alpha males find fellow reinforcement in each other. But much of the Kremlin\u2019s geopolitical playbook has been based on it being the unpredictable, risk-taking party, relying on the West to be the responsible adult, the force for stability and reason. Trump\u2019s friendship is hardly an asset on which to rely, and his balance an even less stable foundation. The Kremlin might actually feel it has to be a little more cautious and predictable, precisely because it is dealing with someone who actually internalizes the kind of devil-may-care belligerence Putin affects.\nSyria will burn. Between Trump\u2019s open desire to get some more bombs dropped, and his expressed willingness to deal with the Assad regime as a lesser evil to Islamic States, we can expect no push for peace and regime change in Syria. Eastern Aleppo may itself prove a harbinger of this war.\nHistory restarts, and democracy loses some of its force of appeal. The notion that the end of the Soviet idea in 1991 meant that history had ended and liberal democracy had won has long been debunked, but this is pretty much the final spadeful of earth on its coffin. It is unlikely that, for the moment, American democracy will have anything like the same power of example, just at the time when Europe is in a populism and legitimacy crisis of its own.\nThe security concerns are global. Trump appears to be unconcerned with climate change \u2014 the single greatest global security threat \u2014 and almost relishing a more confrontational approach to geopolitics. I can hardly see him interested in development aid, or disaster relief, or humanitarian foreign politics in general; his basic calculus appears to be a short-termist profit maximization for USA Inc. This is bad for everyone, whether American or Zimbabwean, or from somewhere in between.\nSome hope at the bottom of Pandora\u2019s box. There always needs to be some hope, but I confess this morning I am scrabbling around in the corners of this particular Pandora\u2019s box to find any. It may galvanize Europe to be more serious in defending itself from overt and covert threats, no longer being able to count on the big brother across the ocean. At the very least hitting the 2% of GDP NATO target expenditure more consistently would be a plus. https://inmoscowsshadows.wordpress.com/2016/11/09/surviving-the-trumpocalypse-first-thoughts/"], [12605, "2016-11-12T18:30:22Z", [0.45], "PERSONNEL for the next three months: \n\u2014Jim Carafano ... at the State Department. \n\u2014Lt.

Moreover, al Bab's fall to the Turkish-backed force would expand a potential Turkish-protected \"safe zone\" for moderate Syrian rebels, who could base their internationally recognized government-in-exile in the area.

Igor Konashenkov, a ministry spokesman, contrasted the situation in Mosul with that of Aleppo, the Syrian city surrounded by Russian-aided government troops where an estimated 275,000 civilians are stuck inside, along with thousands of antigovernment rebels who Russia says have blocked their exit. On Monday, State Department spokesman John Kirby called Moscow\u2019s attempts to compare the situations in Aleppo and Mosul \u201cludicrous\u201d and \u201cabsolutely insulting.\u201d Both the United States and the United Nations said Tuesday that they had no reports of civilian casualties attributed to coalition or Iraqi forces during the Mosul offensive that started two weeks ago, and Kirby pointed to extensive preparations made for the safety of civilians who escape or remain in the city.\nRussia has been stung by widespread international charges that its air attacks in Syria, including air bombardment of rebel-held eastern Aleppo, have intentionally caused hundreds of civilian deaths. The exchange was part of a series of public exchanges that have characterized dialogue between Moscow and Washington in the absence of progress to end the Aleppo siege. The tendentious remarks came as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad told Western journalists invited to interview him in Damascus that he intended to stay in office at least until his current term ends in 2021. \u201cIf you\u2019re the captain of the ship, when you have a storm, you don\u2019t jump into the water,\u201d he reportedly said. \u201cYou lead it to shore.\u201d Far from trying to destroy the Islamic State in both Syria and Iraq, Assad told the group, including journalists from the New York Times and the New Yorker, that the United States is supporting both that group and al-Qaeda allies in Syria. \u201cThe whole argument that the United States wants to fight ISIS is not correct,\u201d Assad said, according to the New Yorker. \u201cThis is an illusion and information.\u201d The actual U.S. goal, he said, is to topple his government (para 1-8).

I'm at 1% only because of the Trump factor - I don't even think even he would do this that quickly, but who knows... Assuming Hillary wins election, I will likely drop to 0%. 1) First - this is some good background on prior efforts: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_peace_process 2)  Where are we today?  The US is actively accusing the regime of war crimes and considering even more severe sanctions vs. Russia: http://bigstory.ap.org/article/cc6c0d7c92f8438698246f30bc61c3fa/kerry-says-russia-syria-should-face-war-crimes-probe\nAnd: http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/10/blames-syria-forces-chemical-attack-161022033828052.html And http://www.businessinsider.com/russia-threatens-us-sanctions-2016-10 3)  Okay, so not a good start. You've got to ask yourself, if the US were to totally reverse course and make their peace w/ Assad staying, why would they do that?  Presumably, they would only do that if their #1 goal (eliminating ISIS) could be accomplished better that way. So if Russia/Syria cooperated and there was a collective effort to destroy ISIS, then maybe.  But in this negotiation, the US has almost no chips to play, because they have a limited on-the-ground presence in the arena. So even if you argue that the US is willing to trade away everything (and endorsing a plan w/ Assad definitely has a real reputational cost to US), I still can't see how or why they would do it on the front-end of a cooperative agreement like this.  As soon as you do it, you convey legitimacy on Assad that's difficult to take back, and if he reciprocates by killing civilians and focusing his troops on fmr opposition instead of ISIS, what are you going to do then? I don't think it's totally impossible that Assad winds up remaining in power and the US one day endorses a peace plan + election that he competes in.  I think prior to that endorsement though, we'd have to see meaningfully more cooperation on ISIS and (hopefully) also a reduction in violence against civilians in Syria.  Endorsing a peace plan that includes him w/o that is pointless - you give up the moral high ground and trade away the very limited influence you had over Syria+Russia actions w/o getting anything in return.  If you withhold your endorsement until the mid-point or back-end of such a process, there is no way it can happen by mid-2017. 4) It's important to note that for this qn to resolve yes, presumably only the Syrian Opposition and Assad would have to make peace (not the kurds, since the kurds really haven't been a part of these talks in recent past). Still, I am not an expert on the region, but I would think the US allowing Assad to remain might impact the US relationship with the kurds and impact how much they help taking back non-kurdish cities in Iraq (i.e. Mosul, which many ppl on the Mosul qn originally thought they would not help with).  There is a broad coalition fighting ISIS that today doesn't really include the Syrian government in a meaningful way to my understanding.  If by endorsing Assad you cause other groups to pull back the amount they help, it's just one more reason to withhold such an endorsement as long as possible. Anyways, net-net, I'd be comfortable with 0% here but for the wildcard of US political leadership.
