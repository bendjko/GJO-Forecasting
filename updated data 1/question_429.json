U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had said on Thursday that the United States pressed China to ramp up economic and political pressure on North Korea, during his meeting with top Chinese diplomats and defense chiefs. China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi and General Fang Fenghui met Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis during the talks. Yang later met with U.S. President Donald Trump in the White House, where they also discussed North Korea, Xinhua reported. The consensus document also highlighted the need to fully and strictly hold to U.N. Security Council resolutions and push for dialogue and negotiation, which has long been China's position on the issue. ***\nMilitary-to-military exchanges should also be upgraded and mechanisms of notification established in order to cut the risks of \"judgment errors\" between the Chinese and U.S. militaries, the statement also said (para 1-6).\n*** Shepherd, C.

At the beginning of February, China was said to have \"a new version of a missile that can carry up to 10 nuclear warheads, signalling a major shift in its nuclear capability.\"  China is upgrading its strategic weapons arsenal. Also in February, \u201cChina Daily\u201d reported \"on the most recent public displays of the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s (PRC) DF-16, designed, in large part, as a potential offensive weapon against the island nation of Taiwan.\"   We'll have to see if tensions continue to escalate and likelihood of such an offensive testing increases.  https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucedorminey/2017/02/15/new-chinese-missile-upgrade-likely-designed-with-taiwan-in-its-crosshairs/#6a4cbc2fba6d"], [35034, "2017-04-20T21:40:31Z", [0.01], "0pc too low given the volatility in this area."], [368, "2017-04-20T21:39:39Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-04-20T11:53:47Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-04-20T05:18:58Z", [0.0], ""], [28091, "2017-04-20T01:55:26Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-04-19T19:00:20Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-04-19T17:36:33Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-04-19T05:20:31Z", [0.0], ""], [35013, "2017-04-18T20:52:48Z", [0.1], ""], [368, "2017-04-18T19:36:40Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-04-18T06:18:34Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-04-17T20:26:38Z", [0.0], ""], [25875, "2017-04-17T18:11:59Z", [0.0], ""], [32438, "2017-04-17T17:33:20Z", [0.01], ""], [691, "2017-04-17T11:09:44Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-04-17T05:05:54Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-04-16T19:43:44Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-04-16T07:52:14Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-04-15T21:03:15Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-04-15T11:35:10Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-04-15T06:09:51Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-04-14T21:05:28Z", [0.0], ""], [34383, "2017-04-14T18:48:24Z", [0.0], ""], [1993, "2017-04-14T18:07:43Z", [0.0], ""], [1993, "2017-04-14T18:07:25Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2017-04-14T17:27:50Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-04-14T06:03:52Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-04-14T03:31:43Z", [0.0], ""], [28091, "2017-04-13T23:59:49Z", [0.01], ""], [691, "2017-04-13T12:05:17Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-04-13T05:20:18Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-04-12T20:01:25Z", [0.0], ""], [34920, "2017-04-12T15:52:16Z", [0.2], "They ain't that ..."], [34918, "2017-04-12T14:15:27Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-04-12T12:24:45Z", [0.0], ""], [31496, "2017-04-12T08:45:39Z", [0.01], ""], [1034, "2017-04-12T05:57:33Z", [0.0], ""], [34184, "2017-04-12T01:20:50Z", [0.25], ""], [368, "2017-04-11T19:08:34Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-04-11T18:40:20Z", [0.0], ""], [877, "2017-04-11T14:26:22Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-04-11T05:55:51Z", [0.0], ""], [32840, "2017-04-11T04:49:26Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-04-11T04:01:40Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-04-10T17:24:31Z", [0.0], ""], [9755, "2017-04-10T13:22:10Z", [0.0], ""], [34757, "2017-04-10T10:29:08Z", [0.0], ""], [32957, "2017-04-10T01:58:05Z", [0.0], ""], [32957, "2017-04-10T01:57:59Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2017-04-09T22:54:06Z", [0.0], ""], [7362, "2017-04-09T13:07:58Z", [0.02], ""], [691, "2017-04-09T11:55:21Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-04-09T05:51:21Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-04-08T20:59:54Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-04-08T11:40:39Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-04-08T05:54:39Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-04-07T20:58:20Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-04-07T20:43:14Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-04-07T05:49:09Z", [0.0], ""], [32258, "2017-04-07T00:48:04Z", [0.0], "Doesn't seem to be much action in Taiwan over independence lately and therefore China is not likely to react to anything.

China has drawn international criticism for large-scale building in the South China Sea, although Li told reporters in Australia the development was for civilian purposes only. \"China's facilities, Chinese islands and reefs, are primarily for civilian purposes and, even if there is a certain amount of defense equipment or facilities, it is for maintaining the freedom of navigation,\" Li said. China claims most of the resource-rich South China Sea, through which about $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes every year. Neighbors Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims on the strategic waterway. The United States estimates Beijing has added more than 3,200 acres (1,300 hectares) of land on seven features in the South China Sea over the past three years, building runways, ports, aircraft hangars and communications equipment. The United States has conducted a series of freedom-of-navigation operations in the South China Sea, raising tensions between Washington and Beijing (para. 1-6). Packham, C. (2017.)

Tsai touted the contract with CSBC Corp., Taiwan, on Tuesday during a visit to a naval base in the southern city of Kaohsiung as a necessary step to improve the island\u2019s defenses. The company plans to deliver the first diesel-electric model in 2024, with deployment expected a year or two later. \u201cUnderwater combat readiness is the part of Taiwan\u2019s defense that needs the most support,\u201d Tsai said. \u201cI understand it is challenging to build submarines locally. The rule in the international political reality is that you need to help yourself before getting help from others.\u201d Taiwan decided to go the indigenous route after more than a decade of talks to buy eight U.S. submarines proved fruitless, and European suppliers steered clear any deal that could anger China. Tensions between Beijing and Taipei have been simmering since voters swept Tsai\u2019s pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party into power last year, raising local concerns about China\u2019s military-modernization drive. The Taiwanese Ministry of National Defense last week cited China\u2019s capacity to blockade or invade its outer islands to justify plans to boost military spending by half to 3 percent of gross domestic product. Taiwan expects to spend NT$356 billion on defense this year -- a tiny fraction compared with China, which views the island as a province to be retaken by force if necessary. China has at least 53 diesel-powered attack submarines, many based at Hainan Island, southwest of Taiwan. That force would likely grow to between 69 and 78 boats by 2020, according to the Pentagon\u2019s latest report on China\u2019s military (para. 1-6). Lin, A. & Tweed, D. (2017).
