I think if it happens anywhere it South Sudan (SS) is most likely. \nNow let's get down into why.  First, there is political instability, as of last night, the Parliament voted to extend the president's election until 2021 [1] (sources are listed below). This matters because, this is the same regime where peace deals have been bartered and broken [2].  Also, \"likely to undermine peace talks as opposition groups have said the change would be illegal.\" is quoted in the same article.  \"should be declared as a rogue regime,\u201d Mabior Garang de Mabior, spokesman of Machar\u2019s rebel group,\" On to the second part, it's happening very recently [3]. There are reports that between April and May, 232 Civilians were killed  and 120 women/girls were gang raped by an army of soldiers and it is likely to be higher. But why does this happen?  Quoted in the same article, the targets were in \"targeted opposition-controlled villages in the north of the country in April and May, government troops and allied militias\". Also the fighting increases when people are fighting.  The next part, it is the lean season.  About half the country is malnourished [4][5].  There are only a couple of rebel groups in South Sudan. It's not a far jump to make that one group is blaming the other group for taking all the food. So what is one (morbid) solution to that problem (or justification), kill people who are opposing so we can all survive. Kind of like Thanos.  1.
