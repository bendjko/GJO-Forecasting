Sasec and BIMSTEC have produced successful results, in contrast to SAARC which has achieved precisely nothing at all in the many decades of its existence. SASEC  South Asian countries will be greatly benefited by a single interconnected power market that will also give India a chance to replace its fossil fuel-based generation with cleaner hydropower from countries like Bhutan and Nepal, according to Asian Development Bank. The unanticipated shortages in one country\u2019s power grid can be readily solved by imports from a neighbouring grid, said a blog written by Priyantha Wijayatunga, ADB Director (Energy Division) for South Asia Regional Department. A single interconnected power market is a clear win for the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) countries as the power systems of all countries would be integrated through adequate cross border transmission capacity to share power with each other, he said. \u201cUnder this arrangement, smaller countries like Nepal and Sri Lanka would rely on market to provide reserve generation capacity, lowering their own investment costs, while fossil fuel-based generation in Bangladesh and India would be replaced with cleaner hydropower from Bhutan and Nepal.\u201d \nhttp://www.livemint.com/Industry/JjeP6L78JroOEkQu1xD0XP/Interconnected-power-market-a-clear-win-for-South-Asia-ADB.html BIMSTEC BIMSTEC, have gained prominence in the foreign policymaking of countries in the sub-region. This is evidenced by India\u2019s recently announced US$120 billion Sagarmala project, the India-led Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal (BBIN) Motor Vehicles Agreement, the Trilateral Maritime Security Cooperation Initiative between India, Sri Lanka and the Maldives, and finalisation of the India\u2013Bangladesh land boundary agreement. Notably, at the group\u2019s 8th ministerial meeting in Kathmandu on 11 August 2017, all seven countries agreed to expedite the BIMSTEC free trade agreement, which has been on the agenda since 2004. This is important considering that South Asia is yet to witness the realisation of a free trade area. The rising salience of BIMSTEC in India\u2019s political and economic calculus was also evident at the 2016 BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) Outreach Summit in India, where BIMSTEC leaders joined for a BRICS\u2013BIMSTEC meeting. The BIMSTEC grouping was chosen over SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation), which many considered the natural choice for such a meeting.\nhttp://www.eastasiaforum.org/2017/09/23/can-india-take-the-lead-on-bimstec/ SAARC is deader than the dinosaurs.

left for Thimpu (Bhutan) on Saturday to represent Pakistan in the forthcoming 70th executive committee meeting of the Saarc Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Talking to media prior to departure, leader of the delegation and Saarc Chamber Vice President Iftikhar Ali Malik said distinctive features of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) would be highlighted during the deliberations apart from other issues confronting the region. He said CPEC would act as a trading hub between South Asia, Middle East and Europe, thereby enhancing trade potential of the entire region. \u201cCPEC is a geo-economic project which will benefit the entire region both directly and indirectly,\u201d he said, adding the economic corridor would promote regional cooperation in South Asia, driven by trade and energy, through the building of ports, pipelines, road and rail infrastructure. Answering a question, Malik said goods from landlocked Bhutan and Nepal could not access Pakistan markets via land route through India. \u201cThese countries cannot send their goods through Pakistan to Central Asia and China. Similarly, Bangladesh cannot access the shorter land route through India to Pakistan and onward to China or West Asia, North Africa and Gulf states,\u201d he said, adding in contrast goods from island nations \u2013 the Maldives and Sri Lanka \u2013 could reach China through Gwadar (para. 1-6).

India including Afghanistan, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Maldives will not attend SAARC SUMMIT due to 2016 Uri attack. Pakistan postponed the SAARC summit and announced that new dates would be released soon. Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in his address to the 19th SAARC summit being held in the Nepal\u2019s capital, said that the objective of this summit was to address the security issues between India and Pakistan. Hours after Indian PM Narendra Modi decided to boycott the SAARC Summit in Islamabad in the wake of Uri terror attack Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Bhutan, Maldives and Sri Lanka have pulled out of the summit.\nIndia alleged Pakistan for terrorism. It is reported by Indian media that the SAARC summit in Pakistan is cancelled due to pulling out of six SAARC member states citing \"poor conducive atmosphere\" in the South Asian region. The significance of Modi\u2019s decision lay in its aftermath: Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, and Bhutan followed suit, also boycotting the summit. This solidarity boycott, which dealt Pakistan a humiliating snub and forced the cancellation of the summit, was discussed in the Indian media as either a far-sighted sidelining of Pakistan in the region or a death blow to an already dysfunctional organization. In reality it is neither. In the long term, Pakistan cannot be sidelined in South Asia, and the boycott, by Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in particular, paradoxically represents an opportunity for India and SAARC.\nAll of this is to say that Bangladesh\u2019s and Sri Lanka\u2019s support for India in boycotting the SAARC summit is the result of improved bilateral relationships due to propitious circumstances. The Awami League is in power in Bangladesh while the Sinhalese nationalist president of Sri Lanka, Mahinda Rajapaksa, has been replaced by the milder Maithripala Sirisena. These conditions present a real opportunity for SAARC. The only way to move SAARC forward is to maintain a \u201cSAARC minus one\u201d strategy. This strategy simply means bypassing Pakistan while maintaining engagement, and promoting sub-regional groupings within SAARC. This has been somewhat initiated already with the motor vehicles agreement between Bhutan, Bangladesh, India, and Nepal, which allows for smooth transfers of passengers and cargo vehicles between the three countries.\nhttp://thediplomat.com/2016/11/saarc-is-dead-long-live-saarc/\n_______________________________________\nCOMMENTS:  This solidarity boycott, which dealt Pakistan a humiliating snub and forced the cancellation of the summit, was discussed in the Indian media as either a far-sighted sidelining of Pakistan in the region or a death blow to an already dysfunctional organization.

Preparation for a new summit would probably take minimum 6 months, hence the absolute earliest the summit could be held is end of year 2017. With tensions on the India-Pakistani border remaining high, it seems more likely that it will be delayed further. There has even been speculation that the cancellation marks the end of the SAARC initiative.
