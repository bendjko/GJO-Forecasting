Ortiz was finance minister under Zedillo; he's been Mexico's ambassador to the IMF, chairman of Banorte, chief at Banco de Mexico...

Margarita Zavala quit the race this week, improving, somewhat, chances for Anaya and Meade.  As the Trump victory and others recently showed, we can't look at polls alone. It's the third run for AMLO thus trying to figure out how is the country ready or more willing to embrace him as leader? What has changed this time around?  Will Mexicans elect AMLO among the level of violence in the country?  This year alone, 91 pre-candidates from all parties have been murdered, over 200 assaulted, in the run up to Mexico's regional and national elections.  It's a panorama that tends to favor hard-liners.  Then again, the staggering violence, is the elephant in the room in the campaign trail. The picture I see of Mexico from the outside, the political system in power, would say AMLO is not going to win in the end, but the election system itself (one round, more than two candidates) gives AMLO the odds.   Biggest difference I see this time seems to be the people AMLO is running against, they're much less charismatic, are failing to inspire impassioned following.  Meade is running a great campaign but the stain of the  PRI and EPN's government may be too much for him to overcome.   In 2012, aside from the country seeking to change from PAN and what was seen as Pres. Calderon's failed war against drug gangs and violence, Pe\u00f1a Nieto was hugely popular, sold as a quasi soap opera star. EPN received 38.4%, AMLO 31.6%.  In 2006, Calderon was declared the winner over AMLO with a difference of a bit over half of a percentage point. AMLO accused Calderon of fraud, protested for months, refusing to accept election results. The PAN candidate, Josefina Mota, got 25.4% and a green party candidate 2.3%.  In 2000, Fox got 42.5%, Labastida 36.1%, and Cardenas 16.6%. \nGoing back to my point of the difference in the candidates AMLO is running against this time around,  in comparison to the people who have run in the last 16 years, Pe\u00f1a Nieto, Calderon, Fox, Labastida, Cardenas, and AMLO himself all fit the bill of \"presidential\". (Pe\u00f1a Nieto aside, all these names have been iconic in some way) Being \"presidential\" is something Anaya (who is mocked as looking like cartoon character Chicken Little) seems to be lacking.  I think Anaya will lose on insisting on wearing a down vest to look more down to earth. lol\n\nMeade may have an even a weaker image, but that is only until he speaks.  In these times of social media and short attention spans and only reading headlines, it's a tough battle.  Meade tends to lose the masses  with his technocrat lingo, can't speak \"populism\" but he has an impressive program of proposals and experience.  If there are surprises, my take is they would be related to Meade.   I don't think the odds of AMLO getting over 50% are good.  He lost to EPN by 7 pts in 2012.  No candidate since Salinas de Gortari beat Cuauhtemoc Cardenas in 1988 has received over 50% in a presidential election in Mexico.
