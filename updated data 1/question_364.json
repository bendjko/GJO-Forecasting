The bad news is that such an interpretation differs from mine, and likely a large number of other GJO participants. Facebook has approximately 2 Billion active users worldwide, of which only approximately 16 million are in France. Personally, I would not consider such a small percentage to be \"widespread.\" In fact, to my mind, it would be quite \"limited.\" But again, the good news is that we now know how GJO intends to interpret the word, even if it is idiosyncratic.\nhttps://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/\nhttps://www.statista.com/statistics/380586/number-of-mobile-facebook-users-in-france/ 2) Another critical word requiring interpretation is \"default.\" In general, (and of course to my mind, because as Berlo reminds us, meanings are in people) a default feature is something that is \"turned on\" without user intervention.

Unverifiable sources will not show up on trends but can still be liked or shared by users on their personal feeds. Trending topics will not be shaped by users' preferences, thus serving more like a traditional \"broadcast\" rather than \"nichecast.\" FB has now acted to officially prevent spreading fake news but allow users to freely share stories.

Between now and July they will need to do testing and be supported, a lot of work. This may not matter as the roll out could occur but just not be very successful. Another big driver will be the upcoming German election. It appears that Facebook is working to have this up and running prior to the election to be held 24 Sep 17. German campaigns, similar to Westminster systems, are very short, typically about 6 weeks [1]. This means that it will start at the end of July or early August.

Section 130 makes it a crime to publicly incite hatred against parts of the population or to call for violent or arbitrary measures against them or to insult, maliciously slur or defame them in a manner violating their (constitutionally protected) human dignity. Thus for instance it is illegal to publicly call certain ethnic groups \"maggots\" or \"freeloaders\". Volksverhetzung is punishable in Germany even if committed abroad and even if committed by non-German citizens, if only the incitement of hatred takes effect within German territory, e.g., the seditious sentiment was expressed in German writing or speech and made accessible in Germany (German criminal code's Principle of Ubiquity, Section 9 \u00a71 Alt. 3 and 4 of the Strafgesetzbuch)."], [5386, "2017-01-17T14:57:21Z", [0.99], "I think that this question will be decided in Europe, where legislation against hate speech and lies ('fake news' in newspeak) makes Facebook (and other platforms) responsible for allowing such content.

The public could flag what they think may be untrue to prompt the fact checkers to look into them.

Some countries may be more tolerant of fake news than others, but now that Facebook has come up with something that sounds like a workable compromise, they will not be able to go backward. \nIt would be difficult (and probably unworkable) if Facebook did little or nothing about fake news in some countries, but took the action that it will need to take to avoid big fines in others. (I am sure the EU would be willing to pass the laws to send a multi-billion dollar bill to Facebook if they don't take appropriate action, and with the EU Parliament, the EU Commission, France, Germany and Italy all on the bandwagon, and with the need to have a cause that the whole EU can agree on, Facebook will need to deliver).

Governments will decide who is responsible for fake news as they decide who is responsible for lots of other things that are deemed harmful. \nI fully agree that marking the news items as probably untrue will not put a lot of people of reading them, but I think it is smart thinking for Facebook to get other organizations to do the fact checking to avoid the claim that Facebook is censoring what its users can read.  I think the fake news debate will run and run and will merge into the libel laws.

If the answer is \"no\", then I think it's likely that FB will add warning labels to stories. I imagine they would function similarly to the tags that mods on the politics subreddit can add. I can't find any data on when the politics subreddit adopted tags for articles, but stories tagged as having misleading titles still regularly make it to the front page of reddit, suggesting having the tag alone does not detract from user engagement. In fact, it might actually increase user engagement. Other factors that affected my initial estimate- Currently, they have a feature that allows users to report fake news; while it's hard to find, it demonstrates that the company is open to the idea of treating fake news differently. The CEO also seems committed to making this a priority, especially with the negative press surrounding the potential impact of FB and fake news on the US election. I could envision this not happening if the CEO emphasizes his philosophy that the company should not be an arbiter of the truth, which he has done in the past.

In a post, Facebook VP Adam Mosseri said that Facebook will introduce easier ways of reporting hoaxes, and has started collaborating with a number of third-party fact-checking organisations. Mosseri wrote: \"We're testing several ways to make it easier to report a hoax if you see one on Facebook, which you can do by clicking the upper right-hand corner of a post. We've relied heavily on our community for help on this issue, and this can help us detect more fake news.\" The company has also started a program in collaboration with fact checking parties that abide by Poynter's International Fact Checking Code of Principles, which include ABC News, Full Fact and other organisations worldwide. These organisations will fact check content on the platform and report stories that they found to be unreliable. The social media giant will then flag them as 'disputed' and provide a link to an article explaining why this is the case. 'Disputed' stories should also appear lower down in the News Feed. Although Facebook users will still be able to share stories flagged as 'disputed', they will receive a notification before they share them saying \"Disputed by 3rd Parties - Before you share this story, you might want to know that independent fact-checkers disputed its accuracy\".\nhttp://www.itpro.co.uk/networking/27554/facebook-reveals-plan-to-tackle-fake-news"], [16518, "2016-12-16T13:28:22Z", [0.7], "Moving my forecast up three points after reading this article: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/15/technology/facebook-fake-news.html This is a statement from Facebook as a company, rather than just Zuckerberg posting on his own wall about some things they are testing. This indicates that the company is testing fake news labels with a plan to roll them out if it works.  The news likely would have made me move my prediction up five to eight points, but the test was already incorporated into my previous forecast based on Zuckerberg's posts (https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10103269806149061).

It would have been more, but again, the statement was much more qualified than many of the other options he said Facebook is pursuing. (https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10103269806149061) 3. Techcrunch reported that some users see warning labels now. This article raised my prediction by 5%. Assuming (as I said above) that this is just a test and does not mean the question's premise is met, this is a strong indication that warning labels may be in Facebook's future; however, Facebook runs hundreds of tests and few make it to the general public.

Is a partisan site to the left that promotes a 78% accurate story going to be labeled as inaccurate? What about a story that is equally accurate on the right? What about stories that are controversial without intergroup consensus? How do you handle breaking news that have not been confirmed because only one source is reporting? Who takes the blame in instances where the intelligence community was wrong, such as with WMDs in Iraq, which was a widely accepted working theory? What about opinion pieces - can they even be assigned a value? More likely Facebook will add a stamp of approval for credible news stories.

It also places the burden on the news outlet to get certified, which relieves facebook of major engineering work that will not cover edge cases.
