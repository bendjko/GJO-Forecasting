I have been at 0% since the first day, and to be honest, this is beginning to feel more like a reckless wager than a confident forecast. If I lose, I lose it all \u2013 although there is an opportunity to mitigate damages with the other caucus questions. Confession, I will be caucusing with the Democrats, and the thought of a Trump candidacy makes me very, very, very, very sad. I\u2019m sure that has something to do with my stance. That said, my main reasoning for 0% has been the lack of Trumps \u201cground game\u201d throughout the process. I will say listening to the news, reading 3 of the state\u2019s newspapers, and visiting the candidate\u2019s websites, that finding ones caucus is easier and more transparent than it has ever been \u2013 and Trump\u2019s is the easiest of any. Type in your address and it tells you where to go. You can print out a simple flyer on \u201cHow to Caucus in Iowa\u201d if you need. Other sites have no obvious direct link (Rubio), or they want you to fork over name, email before sharing where to show (Cruz). But without boots on the ground, can Trump get folks to show up? He has probably hired a call center\u2026.??? Weather is always cited as a concern. This year, weather is in the 30\u2019s \u2013 warm for Iowa (we get hit later). The winter storm will be entering from the SE, arriving sometime between 9 PM and midnight, starting as rain, wintery mix, and turning to snow later on. Looks like it will be missing the SE third of the state almost completely. It will be too late to interfere with the caucuses, and should allow everyone to get out of town wanting to head for New Hampshire and points east. The threat of a blizzard may divert some caucus goers who think a trip to the supermarket is more important than the caucus. The doors close at 7:00 and participants need to be in line by then. All-in-all, it should not greatly effect turnout for those who plan ahead. And then there are the polls. Generally they are still close. Likely voter polls give Trump a greater edge that the \u201cstalwart\u201d polls (those polls that canvass the folks listed as actually voting on a regular basis.) Turnout is key, for Trump. I repeat, can he do it? One of my main concerns is Cruz has appeared to peak, and may not be a second choice.  There are a lot of candidates, and votes could be fragmented. There is still around 50% (question that) of caucus goers who are undecided (http://www.radioiowa.com/2016/01/18/surveying-undecided-iowa-gop-caucus-goers/ ). Who will they decide? Even though the Republican method insures one person one vote, folks don\u2019t like to waste a vote. If a voter shows up thinking Rick Santorum but is the only one, will they vote for Rick, or break for Cruz? Rubio? Trump? Possibly be swayed by a few Ben Carsons?

It's national in scope, but puts an interesting twist on how I've been reading the race between Cruz & Trump. \"Being seen as a religious person is generally an asset for candidates; people who think a candidate is a religious person tend to be more likely to see that candidate as a potentially good president. But many Republicans think Trump would be a good president despite his perceived lack of religiousness. Of the 56% of GOP voters who think Trump would be a good or great president, a substantial minority of them (17% of Republican registered voters overall) say they think Trump is not religious. The pattern is very different for the other leading GOP candidates; virtually all Republicans who think Cruz, Rubio and Carson would be successful presidents (and who express a view about their religiousness) also say they view those candidates as at least somewhat religious. \n...\nThe new survey shows that among religious groups, fully half of white evangelical Protestant voters (including both Republicans and those who identify with the Democratic Party or as political independents) think Trump would make a \u201cgood\u201d or a \u201cgreat\u201d president. Evangelicals \u2013 who are among the most reliably Republican religious constituencies in the electorate \u2013 express a similar degree of confidence that Carson and Cruz would be successful presidents.\n...\nWhile there are about as many evangelicals who think Trump would be a \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cgreat\u201d president as say the same about Cruz and Carson, there also is considerably more wariness about Trump than about Carson or Cruz; three-in-ten evangelicals (29%) say Trump would be a \u201cpoor\u201d or \u201cterrible\u201d president, which is roughly twice the share who say this about either Cruz or Carson.\" Trump's \"good/great\" assessment of 52% just squeaks by Cruz's 49% on that last quoted paragraph.

The Cruz/Trump rivalry is a contrivance with an end game objective of keeping the Republican Party from going with a Brokered Convention -and/or if it does - giving them both power broker status - Cruz and Trump are using the public display of animosity to divvy up Deming sources of campaign funds.

This could be completely bogus thinking bubbling up from a swamp of sketchy data.  But here goes.  Until now, I have been heavily influenced by the following ideas:  (1) Iowa is different, (2) Iowa voters are different, (3) the Iowa caucus format is odd, (4) Cruz has a strong connection with a conservative religious block of voters, (4) Cruz's presumed \"great ground game\" will win the day, (5) Trump's Iowa strategy is slap-dash, (6) People from New York City are not popular in Iowa.  However, I have to admit that Trump seems to be smarter (and tougher) than I am and he may well be a marketing genius.  Marketing is such a tricky business.  Marketing theories seem so simple, but many people underestimate how difficult it is to achieve marketing success.  Trump has done a brilliant job of getting to the front of a crowded field.  He's had to use some wild tactics to do this, but he knew what he was doing at moments when other candidates (like Bush) had no clue.  I now believe that Trump understands Iowa and certain weaknesses in retail distribution that have eluded me.  You can ride a bus through Iowa for weeks.  You can line up precinct chairs all over the place.  That may not matter because Cruz has serious problems with his personal brand and skillful brand management usually crushes door-to-door.  Everyone Cruz has ever worked with, hates him, and voters can now see why.  Trump just slaughtered Cruz when he made his smug \"New York Values\" attack.  After Trump's rebuttal, the camera focused in on Cruz and he stood revealed as the most unpopular kid in class.  I can no longer ignore the evidence that Trump is winning the branding contest on a national level by a huge margin.  He has the outright poll lead in 24 states and is tied in 7 others.  Is there really something different about Iowa?  Is there something special about the Republican caucus format?   Is the ground game everything in Iowa?  One should note that the Republican caucus rules are not the same as Democratic caucus rules.  Unlike Democrats, Republican caucus goers will not be standing around in groups waiting to be counted.  Republicans have no group viability disqualification process.  Republicans will not be waving at other members of the church choir to recruit them for the next count.  The Republican caucus format is a straight-up secret ballot.

This is especially true of the demographic that supports Mr. Trump: younger voters and others with a low propensity to turn out. \"As temperatures plunged to single digits over the weekend, canvassers for Hillary Clinton posted photographs of themselves on social media going door to door in the snow. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump\u2019s volunteers in Davenport, a city where the campaign appears to be better organized than elsewhere, decided it was too cold to go out. \"Seven volunteers worked the phones at the Iowa headquarters of Senator Marco Rubio of Florida in a Des Moines suburb one night last week. At the state headquarters of Mr. Cruz, there were 24 volunteers in a room beneath a sign proclaiming a daily goal of making 6,000 calls. The Trump state headquarters in West Des Moines were largely deserted. \"Asked for comment about Mr. Trump\u2019s Iowa organizing, a spokeswoman for the candidate, Hope Hicks, wrote in an email, \u201cThere is no one available to speak with you.\u201d \"There are some positive signs suggesting that Trump supporters, whose enthusiasm gives an electric charge to his rallies, may show up in large numbers on their own, defying caucus tradition. Whereas attendees at Trump rallies last year were often noncommittal about caucusing, many at a rally in Ottumwa on Saturday said they would caucus for Mr. Trump even though they had little idea what was required. \". . .a Trump field representative, Elizabeth Mae Davidson, sought to enlist volunteers as precinct leaders. \u201cWhat does that entail?\u201d asked Selena Jacobs, who had never caucused before. \u201cYou stand up and say why you want to support Mr. Trump,\u201d Ms. Davidson said. \u201cHmm,\u201d Ms. Jacobs replied, adding that she was not sure she would speak well in public. \u201cI think you would, you\u2019re pretty,\u201d Ms. Davidson said. \u201cWe\u2019ll give you a script to read. We\u2019ll have trainings here locally.\u201d Ms. Jacobs was not convinced, but she said she planned to attend the caucus to vote for Mr. Trump. \"Ms. Davidson, based in Davenport, where on Sunday she opened only the second field office in the state for Mr. Trump, is one of the campaign\u2019s most effective organizers. She has recruited captains for nearly all of the 65 precincts in Scott County, in many cases more than one captain per precinct. \"But Davenport appears to be a bright spot compared with other regions of Iowa, like rural Brooklyn, where the Trump precinct captain Clair Kuntz said he had not made any effort to contact people. \u201cWhen I call, it\u2019s not going to be any more than a week out,\u201d he said, adding that he had yet to receive fliers describing Mr. Trump\u2019s positions, a basic canvassing tool that campaigns provide. \"In Fairfield, in southeast Iowa, Mr. Shaddock . . . said it would be difficult to find someone to speak publicly on Mr. Trump\u2019s behalf in each of the eight precincts in the area. He asked the Trump campaign for $500 to rent the Fairfield Arts and Convention Center so all precincts could caucus together, which would require just one speaker. The campaign turned him down. \u201cDonald himself could have spent $500,\u201d he said.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT: \nPluses & minuses for the Trump campaign include\n+charisma & name recognition\n-weak ground campaign Pluses & minuses for the Cruz campaign include\n+excellent ground campaign\n+successful fundraising\n+progress unifying party support\n+strong evangelical church support\n-the \"birther\" challenge\n-looming campaign finance scandal  Every time I check the polls, who is leading seems to be different.

But likely caucusgoers' opinions of the ultraconservative Texas U.S. senator remain sky high (76 percent view him favorably).\n...\nIn third place with likely GOP caucusgoers is Marco Rubio, with 12 percent, and Ben Carson is huddled close behind at 11 percent. Those are precarious perches, because a majority of their supporters say they could still be persuaded to support someone else, said Iowa Poll pollster J. Ann Selzer.\n...\nA majority of likely caucusgoers, 56 percent, could change their minds about their first-place choice or still do not have a first choice, the poll finds.\n...\nThe Iowa Poll of 500 likely Republican caucusgoers was conducted Jan. 7-10 by Selzer & Co. of Des Moines. The margin of error is plus or minus 4.4 percentage points.\n...\nWhile Cruz's lead of 10 percentage points on Trump in early December has whittled to 3 points, underlying data show Cruz to be well-positioned. The constitutional lawyer is the second-choice pick for more voters than any other candidate. And he attracts almost half the electorate when percentages of first- and second-choice preferences are combined, Selzer noted.\n...\nCruz may be boxed in tactically when it comes to attacks: 75 percent of likely caucusgoers view his decision generally to avoid criticizing Trump as a favorable trait.\" http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2016/01/13/8-talking-points-new-iowa-poll-gop-caucus-race/78695088/ \"Among caucusgoers overall who say their minds are made up, the race goes to Trump with 34 percent, Cruz at 30 percent and Carson at 10 percent. All others are in single digits, Selzer said.\n...\nA majority of Cruz\u2019s supporters (56 percent) like his opposition to the Renewable Fuel Standard.\n...\nAmong the overall caucus electorate, a 42 percent plurality don\u2019t like his stance, and 37 percent find it attractive.\nFar more of a problem are Cruz's votes to cut the military and his lack of foreign policy experience.\n...\nCruz has more potential for growing his support than anyone else in the race, including Trump. Cruz is second choice of almost half of Trump supporters (47 percent), Selzer said. The reverse isn\u2019t true for Trump: Only 25 percent of Cruz backers pick Trump second.

Q2 \u2013 On Obama\u2019s Birthplace - The Midwest skewed highest in the belief that Obama was not born in the U.S. and Republicans polled highest in that belief (53%) \u2013 no surprises here. Q3 \u2013 On Cruz Eligibility \u2013 Overall majority view Cruz as eligible. Republicans\u2019 high response in the affirmative (70%) drives the overall up. Republicans exhibit the least uncertainty one way or another (17%) as regards eligibility. And while the Midwest has the least uncertainty among census regions as to his eligibility (20%), it scores only third in the affirmative (57%), and first in the negative (22%).  \u2013 this gets underneath the question of Republican acceptance of a birther charge leveled against one of their own, yet from Q1 they may not be as certain about actually voting for him (at least as a proxy as in Q1) Q4 \u2013 Cruz/Trump Believability \u2013 Most believe Cruz\u2019s assertions as to his eligibility over Trump, but Republicans and the Midwest region believe Trump more than their other demographic counterparts (i.e. democrats, indies, South, West). Fair number still unsure who to believe (29%) Q5 \u2013 Trump Belief v Trump Attack \u2013 The majority believe Trump is just on the attack rather than espousing any sort of genuine belief.

Huckabee, for example, completed the Iowa Long March today (http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2016/01/07/mike-huckabee-99th-county-campaign-iowa-caucus/78281080/). His timing was excellent; the season's first Arctic Blast is forecast to commence on Saturday. The Register's campaign tracker listed 25 Huckabee events between January 2 and now, second only to the 28 Sen. Cruz planned between January 4 and 9. Clearly, both men consider Iowa vital to their future success. But will either be able to quickly lock up a room come caucus night? Evangelical participants-- the target audience for both-- have several self-identified candidates from which to choose, and will see them regularly in the next two weeks: Cruz, Huckabee, Dr. Carson (13 events listed between January 6 and 11) and Sen. Santorum (11 events listed between January 7 and 12). Supporters may work long and hard to come to a consensus on February 1st.  Restraint appears to be a common theme among more \"secular\" candidates, though they have hardly conceded the get-to-know-you field (with the possible exception of Govs. Gilmore and Christiem who had no scheduled events as of today). The former CEO of HP just scheduled six events next week. Gov. Kasich had one on the 4th, while Sen. Rubio had five between January 4 and 6. Gov. Bush has four listed on January 12-13, and Sen. Paul-- by far the most ambitious of this group-- is on a 10 event spree today and tomorrow. Their events, too, are high-touch, the most remote being a town hall. Again, caucus participants will be asked to winnow. But, if I may be so bold as to surmise that these will be the so-called \"establishment\" Republicans, their process will also be orderly. They've been through this before.  And then we have The Donald. He doesn't hold \"meet and greets.\" He headlines rallies (two are upcoming) and sells campaign paraphernalia. He excites, or incites, depending on your point of view, people who have drifted away from the political process or did not participate in the first place. They may not be savvy, and they may not know where to go on caucus night (JeanP's comments are insightful in this regard), but they are fired up. And his campaign, more than any other, gives them permission to vent their frustrations. He says what some of them want to say, but don't... in public. He struts. He pouts. He interrupts himself with ever more out-there statements. In Bad Boy parlance, he's Mick Jagger in a suit (with apologies to Sir Mick.) I may be proven wrong, but I still give him a 25% shot at winning, and a greater chance at coming in second. As a Minnesotan, I've seen what a \"screw it\" candidate can do. Gov. Ventura won because a wave of non-voters took advantage of same-day registration in an election featuring two of the least exciting \"normal\" candidates in recent memory.

Then I moved to the view that in a multi horse race you should very rarely place an even money bet (although a couple of previous races argue against that) so I made my first position a 30% chance of winning and then looked for reasons to adjust that number.\nI was influenced by the Politico story showing a significant majority of GOP insiders thought Trump would win Nevada , New Hampshire and South Carolina but the same survey with the same methodology showed Trump behind in Iowa (http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/politico-caucus-donald-trump-iowa-2016-polling-216227) . So I adjusted my number downwards by 10%. It seems like people are finally coming to a view that Trump is not going to implode by himself (http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/12/07/anti-trump-effort-launches-super-pac/) and some serious money may be coming to the table to battle with him. That adjusted his chances down. I estimated 4% The Monmouth poll (http://www.monmouth.edu/assets/0/32212254770/32212254991/32212254992/32212254994/32212254995/30064771087/de240398-df23-47b6-8470-91977d38b749.pdf) on Iowa as opposed to National polls shows Cruz gaining and Carson tanking with Rubio also gaining. In politics momentum is important and it seems that although Carson is falling away numbers are not moving to Trump. There appears to be some sort of ceiling to Trumps support in Iowa which may mean that if the vote solidifies he will not gain much but other candidates will. This seems to be also reflected in the RCP Poll average data which I would rely on more than individual polls (http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/ia/iowa_republican_presidential_caucus-3194.html). However I felt that information was reinforcing my other adjustments rather than adding to them.\nGiven the nature of the Iowa caucuses are different than the others (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_caucuses) involve a large percentage of evangelicals, and require a much stronger local organisation that discounted Trumps chances against Cruz in Iowa although that factors play out differently in other states. Again this reinforced other information but dropped my estimate by a further 5% I then looked at what would happen if a candidate imploded. Given that Trump has been given every chance to implode and has not done so I discounted that likelihood. I also looked at the possibility that Trump went out as an independent but concluded that was already in the numbers as he would only do so if he felt his chances of the Republican nomination was gone. Given my comments above about ceilings on votes and the way the Carson votes seem to be moving I had the view that if Rubio or Carson imploded further it would assist Cruz while if Cruz imploded it would assist Rubio more. However the chances of that happening seem low at this phase of the contest so I adjusted my number down by 2% only Finally prediction markets are pricing Trump at 26c versus Cruz at 67 cents (https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=da093a12-d1da-4fe6-a504-d051518b47d6&b=145fb819-ade8-4e45-982f-a788b61c2bff&ses=4&sh=1&sds=5&amp;) That adjuted my number upwards by 2% because it was a higher figure than my assessment All that resulted in 11%\n"], [734, "2015-12-15T02:50:28Z", [0.13], "Reaffirming, but....

Obviously, this is a great poll for Cruz, but what matters is whether Cruz can maintain the lead.  I am not ready to rule out Trump winning at this point. Some thoughts about the poll and why Trump should not panic (yet): 1.  The sample may not accurately represent those who will participate in the Iowa caucus. Does this poll represent new people Trump is bringing in?  On the other hand, how reliable is a potential caucus goer Trump\u2019s people signed up in a Walmart parking lot?  Still, the sample may be skewed against Trump but this is a factor we will not know until the Caucus.   2.   Trump\u2019s favorable/unfavorable ratings have remained relatively steady since August.  His favorable rating is 57%, down from 59% in October, and 61% in August.  His unfavorable rating is 38%, one up from October\u2019s 37, and three up from August poll\u2019s 35%.   His negatives have not skyrocketed in spite of numerous inflammatory statements. 3.  The % who chose Trump as their first choice for President:  December: 21%; October: 19%; August 23%.  The % who chose Trump as their second choice for President:   December: 14%; October: 9%; August 9%.  These numbers show an improvement since October. 4.  Trump and Cruz have similar numbers for strength of support.  \u201cMind is made up\u201d option:  Cruz-43% and Trump 45%. In October, the numbers were 37 and 32, respectively.

The other candidates' October poll numbers were actually quite similar to their vote percentage in the Caucus. Conclusions:\n-Huckabee and Santorum won because they were the favorites of white evangelical voters.\n-Allegations of misconduct in the personal and business life of Giuliani, Cain, and Gingrich accounts for their defeats.\n-Currently, Trump and Carson are the favorites of evangelical and \"very conservative\" voters by a wide margin.
