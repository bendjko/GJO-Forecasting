Nelson has seen some lag in approval in recent years but Democrats believe the powerful energy of the Gillum for Governor campaign will help attract more young and black voters to vote democrat (https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-senate-spin-cycle/). Florida has also seen a backlash against Trump in part due to the high number of ACA enrolled denizens (https://wellflorida.org/blog/five-years-later-how-aca-is-working-for-florida/).
