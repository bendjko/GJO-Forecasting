Jan Brewer who Ducey appointed state treasurer in April.\" Comment:\nArizona rejected McSally, the fighter pilot who may have revealed that she was less independent than her predecessors. When push came to shove, she cozied up to Trump. If the McCain family holds sway, McSally is unlikely to be appointed. Arizona support for Trump has gone down since his election but that is true of every state in the nation according to Morning Consult.

The question for Ducey to consider is who can win in 2020 since this will be an open seat or one with an appointed Senator which doesn't offer much in the way of incumbent advantage plus Arizona is a diversifying state.

However Senator Jon Kyl (R-AZ) is thinking of resigning at or by the end of the year. \"First of all, I would recommend Martha McSally for a lot of different things, including U.S. Senate, because I supported her candidacy,\" Kyl said. \"But no, I've not made any decisions about when I'm going to step down.\" According to an article [1] in AZ Central, \"Kyl agreed to serve at least through the end of the year\". An article in The Washington Examiner [2] on 19 Nov 2018 claimed \"Kyl has also said that he is in regular contact with Ducey, and that he doesn\u2019t anticipate an announcement will be made in the near future.\" Appointments can happen very quickly after a senatorial vacancy opens up, eg. Al Franken resigned 2 Jan 2018 and was replaced by Tina Smith who took the oath on 3 Jan 2018. Thad Cochran  resigned from the Senate on 1 April 2018, due to health concerns and was replaced by Cindy HYDE-SMITH who Took the oath of office on 9 April 2018.

I built a Monte Carlo model that takes into account dependence in outcomes. As discussed with @ttltran and Beek, I incorporate a \"Partisan Advantage\" variable: this is a random variable that takes on a value around 0 with a standard deviation of 10 percentage points. I take a positive value to reflect a D advantage and vice versa and I add this random variable to the 538 chances of D competitive women and subtract it from the 538 caches of R competitive women. Then, the outcome of each competitive race is determined by a random pick loaded on the basis of the aforementioned calculated probabilities for each race. Then my model repeats this 50,000 times and calculates frequencies.  Interestingly, the addition of the Party Advantage variable doesn't seem to change the results significantly based on sensitivity analysis I did by turning it on and off. I attribute this to the fact that 2 of the 5 women in competitive races are Republican meaning that there is actual anti-correlation between these races and the D races in my model. This is all based on the assumption that the relationship between women winning races is all based on partisanship, i.e. whether there is a blue wave or red wave. In reality, things will be a bit more complicated. I.e. there is probably correlation between outcomes based on type of voters (suburban vs. rural) or correlation due to #metoo turnout. I am guessing that my model is erring on the side of too little overall correlation by assuming too much anti-correlation between a D woman and an R woman. For this reason, I am upping the odds of higher numbers slightly.

Of those 13, five (Nebraska, New York, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Washington) have women standing from both main parties, which leaves eight. These are Missouri, North Dakota, Michigan, California, Minnesota, Mississippi, Hawaii and Massachusetts. According to 538 today, their chances are \nNorth Dakota (Heitkamp) 33% \nMissouri (McCaskill 57%) \nMississippi (Hyde-Smith) 83% \nMichigan (Stabenow) >99% \nCalifornia (Feinstein) 99% \nMInnesota (Klobuchar)>99% \nHawaii (Hirono) >99% \nMassachusetts (Warren) >99% So Heitkamp looks like losing, and it's more likely than not that one of McCaskill and Hyde-Smith will lose too. On the other hand there will be an additional woman Senator from Arizona replacing a male, as both main candidates are women. Finally, Jacky Rosen is running against Dean Heller in Nevada, and 538 has her at 48% today, while Marsha Blackburn has an 80% chance against a male in Tennessee.  At least one of these two should win. (There's also long shot Jenny Wilson (<1% per 538) against Mitt Romney in Utah but one can ignore that race).  Summarizing the above, ten women are not up for reelection this year and six elections have a guaranteed woman winner. Five more women are practically certain (98% chance that all five win), so that makes 21.  Another five have chances of 33,48,57, 80 and 83% respectively) so one can expect three out of five to win. Thus, the most likely outcome is that the number of women in the Senate increases from 23 to 24 after all the elections including Mississippi are completed.

Currently there are 23 women in the Senate, out of whom 13 are running for reelection. Of those 13, five (Nebraska, New York, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Washington) have women candidates from both main parties, which leaves eight.  These are Missouri, North Dakota, Michigan, California, Minnesota, Mississippi, Hawaii and Massachusetts. According to 538 today, their chances are\nNorth Dakota (Heitkamp) 30%\nMissouri (McCaskill 55%)\nMississippi (Hyde-Smith) 83%\nMichigan (Stabenow) >99%\nCalifornia (Feinstein) >99%\nMInnesota (Klobuchar)>99%\nHawaii (Hirono) >99%\nMassachusetts (Warren) >99% So Heitkamp looks like losing, and it's more likely than not that one of McCaskill and Hyde-Smith will lose too. On the other hand there will be an additional woman Senator from Arizona replacing a male, as both main candidates are women.   Finally, Jacky Rosen is running against Dean Heller in Nevada, and 538 has her at 47% today, while Marsha Blackburn has an 80% chance against a male in Tennessee (There's also long shot Jenny Wilson (<1% per 538) against Mitt Romney  in Utah but one can ignore that race). At least one of these two should win. Summarizing the above,  ten women are not up for reelection this year and six elections have a guaranteed woman winner.

Eric Greitens should cement Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill\u2019s defeat in the midterm elections, Republicans confidently predicted on Wednesday. Multiple scandals plaguing Greitens since January threatened to derail the Senate bid of Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, the presumed GOP nominee. But with Greitens sidelined \u2014 his resignation takes effect Friday \u2014 Republicans expect the Senate campaign to become a referendum on McCaskill, to their advantage in a state where a majority approve of President Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge monkey off our back,\u201d a senior Republican strategist in Washington said. \u201cMcCaskill\u2019s clearly the loser in the current scenario,\u201d added Gregg Keller, a Republican consultant based in Missouri who had sounded the alarm about the harm Greitens could do to Hawley\u2019s Senate campaign. \u201cWith the Greitens debacle behind him, Josh now has every opportunity to win the seat and hold the Senate for Republicans.\u201d Greitens announced late Tuesday that he would resign June 1 after spending the five months defending himself against allegations of sexual misconduct and mismanagement of a charity. Charges against the governor, a political outsider first elected in 2016, appeared to mount as he resisted calls from within his own party to step down or face impeachment by a Republican legislature. The soap opera proved a lifeline to McCaskill. The vulnerable Democrat, in trouble for her liberal voting record and opposition of Trump\u2019s agenda, was buffered as Hawley\u2019s campaign was hampered by the Greitens affair. Hawley, in his capacity as state attorney general, was involved in investigating the governor, an effort that angered the GOP base on the one hand and was deemed unsatisfactory by the broader electorate on the other. Democrats involved in the Senate contest claim the issue will linger as a problem for Hawley long after Greitens exits the scene, even though he previously called on the governor to resign and said in a statement that \u201cGov. Greitens has done the right thing\u201d in finally doing so. \u201cThey may think the immediate pressure has been relieved,\u201d a Democratic Senate campaign aide said in an email. \u201cBut Hawley\u2019s vulnerabilities on this scandal remain: he took $50,000 from Greitens \u2014 which he still hasn\u2019t returned \u2014 then looked the other way for a year until he ran a \u2018widely mocked,\u2019 \u2018sub-standard\u2019 investigation of the governor.\u201d Wishful thinking, retort Republicans who have for months openly fretted that Greitens would tank an otherwise sure-thing Senate race for the GOP. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time McCaskill got lucky. In 2012, she appeared just as politically endangered, but won a second term after then-Rep. Todd Akin, the unlikely GOP nominee, made offensive statements about rape. McCaskill is running competitively with Hawley in recent public opinion polls; she held a 45 percent to 43.3 percent lead in the RealClearPolitics average. But the Democrat\u2019s personal standing in a state that approves of Trump by 50 percent is falling short of her position in the horse race, suggesting trouble ahead. According to Morning Consult data that surveyed nearly 300,000 registered voters across the country from Jan. 1\u2013April 30, Missouri voters gave McCaskill a paltry 38 percent approval rating. These numbers, combined with what some Republicans are describing as a newly aggressive Hawley after initial criticism for how he was running his campaign, are problematic for McCaskill without the Greitens scandal to offset her inherent political weakness. Republican insiders said McCaskill might have mitigated her challenges by syncing herself with the politics of her state through support of a few prominent items on Trump\u2019s legislative agenda, or high profile nominees, whether Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch or just-confirmed Central Intelligence Agency Director Gina Haspel. \u201cClaire\u2019s path to re-election has always been to get a lot of Trump voters. To do that she had to support a lot of the Trump agenda. She refused. It was probably a career-ending mistake,\u201d a Republican strategist said.\" _______________ Comments: While McCaskill does have a track record of performing well in tough elections, whether because of luck or skill, I don't know, even with the \"blue wave\" coming in, if she can withstand Hawley."], [57918, "2018-06-01T12:38:26Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.15, 0.15, 0.35, 0.3], ""], [52343, "2018-06-01T03:49:43Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.4, 0.6, 0.0], ""], [9755, "2018-05-31T22:38:15Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.85], ""], [53897, "2018-05-31T18:59:44Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.3, 0.2, 0.15], ""], [691, "2018-05-31T18:49:19Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.46, 0.49, 0.05], ""], [1333, "2018-05-31T14:05:47Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.3, 0.35, 0.3], "22.1% of 2018 congressional candidates are female\nGender has been a prevailing theme of national and local media coverage in this year\u2019s elections.

Based on all that my equation is 23+1 (Arizona)+1(Nevada)+-2(Missouri & North Dakota)."], [691, "2018-05-28T18:01:37Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.46, 0.49, 0.05], ""], [58284, "2018-05-28T12:55:21Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.13, 0.57, 0.24, 0.03], ""], [16501, "2018-05-27T18:20:58Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.5], ""], [11242, "2018-05-27T18:14:33Z", [0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.45, 0.0, 0.3], ""], [46339, "2018-05-27T15:44:50Z", [0.9, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [31542, "2018-05-27T15:12:11Z", [0.1, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1], ""], [8622, "2018-05-27T13:22:17Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.9, 0.07, 0.03], ""], [58556, "2018-05-27T13:21:10Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.7], "The issue has gained much more support since Trump became president and women are stepping up."], [15674, "2018-05-27T13:20:33Z", [0.15, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.05, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [35636, "2018-05-27T12:12:37Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.14, 0.49, 0.32, 0.05], "Only 24 from 17?

Will be a true test of bias for me given how the grumpy old white men have been so hopeless. What harm can the ladies do if they're given a half-decent chance? Don't mean to start political arguments but it's inevitable.  Anyhow I'm skewed higher than I would be if I wasn't so hopeful and optimistic. Factoring in McCaskill holds her Missouri seat. Think there could be a gain of 2 but know there will easily be a loss or two, so really should have 10% for 21 seats. Given the half-year timeline I'm also skewing higher and will inevitably scale downwards with PoT and the WoC will be dragged down by the sceptics and cynics going in at <19 somehow.  If it were my utopia women would have been at 35 to 40 long ago. In Australia one party got around to doing a quota and it worked, but the other party believe it's anathema to the liberal ethos. And so they still only have a paltry 10% or so. Which makes me wonder if we really ought to just have a cap of men at 50% rather than a quota to reach 50% women?! Does the DNC use a quota system?

As @Pixolet noted, the 3 most likely to lose their seats are McCaskill, Heitkamp, and Baldwin. As the primaries continue to shake out, we'll get a better idea of who the main candidates for both parties will be for some other seats. Of states that can be won by women candidates, Arizona, Nevada, and Tennessee are the most likely (in my opinion and that of @Pixolet below) of having a female senator in January 2019.  I think McCaskill is the only one truly in danger, and I think Arizona is the most likely to gain a female senator. What I am less sure of, and will rely on the primaries to assist with, is whether any male incumbents (R or D) fall to women challengers, especially in blue states that are shifting more towards the Bernie Sanders wing of the party. However, initial research indicates those incumbents are likely safe for this election cycle. So, most likely, 23 female senators in January 2019, with a possible +/-1 (slight edge to +1).

Claire McCaskill (D Mo.): \"McCaskill has always faced a tough road to reelection. She\u2019s one of just three Democrats elected statewide in Missouri, which Trump won by almost 20 points. And the GOP is already seizing on McCaskill\u2019s ardent support for Clinton in 2016 as a way to rile up the base. Still, she\u2019s won a reputation as a strong campaigner and a consistently prolific fundraiser this cycle. State Attorney General Josh Hawley is still considered a top GOP recruit. But Republicans are closely watching his first-quarter fundraising haul following grumblings about his disappointing fundraising pace last year. The investigations into blackmail allegations against Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens (R) could add a tinge of scandal to the Republican brand in the state.\" Also, GJO gives her a 65% chance of reelection, so I gotta take that into account :) 2. Heidi Heitkamp (D N.D): \"Republicans caught a break when they convinced Rep. Kevin Cramer to mount a late bid against Heitkamp. Cramer has made his campaign about fierce loyalty to Trump, who won the state by 36 points in 2016. Cramer can also run on the statewide name recognition he\u2019s built up as a three-term congressman in an at-large seat. But Republicans had wavered on Cramer before, looking for other alternatives to the gaffe-prone congressman before ultimately settling on him as the top choice. And while Trump repeatedly pushed Cramer to run, the president has also been on good terms with Heitkamp, who has appeared on stage with him in North Dakota and flew on Air Force One. The escalating trade war between Trump and China could also dampen the GOP\u2019s prospects. China\u2019s retaliatory tariffs threaten to hurt jobs in the agriculture-heavy state, an issue that could weigh on Cramer.\" 3. Tammy Baldwin (D Wis.): \"Wisconsin was once seen as a reach for Republicans. But the barrage of attack ads from outside GOP groups have softened Baldwin up ahead of November, prompting a flurry of Democratic spending meant to shore up the senator. It\u2019s still unclear who will emerge from the contentious GOP primary. Marine Corps veteran Kevin Nicholson, a former Democrat, is the pick of top conservative groups, but state Sen. Leah Vukmir has some big Wisconsin names in her corner.\" Both McCaskill and Heitkamp are being challenged by men, but both races are pretty much tossups at this point. However, Leah Vukmir has the backing of the state GOP organization (https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2018/05/23/state-republican-party-going-all-leah-vukmir-wisconsin-u-s-senate-race/634291002/), so if Vukmir is elected, then that seat will not change per this forecast. However, there is another factor that must be considered. That is, the empty Arizona Senate seat left by Jeff Flake. The leaders from both parties, Kyrsten Sinema and Martha McSally, are women, so I would give a +1 for women senators. *Side note, McSally's main competition in the GOP primary is another woman, Kelli Ward. In addition, the race to replace Sen. Bob Corker (Tennessee) is looking very close between Phil Bredesen, the Democratic candidate, and Marsha Blackburn, that of the GOP, but Bredesen looks to have a slight lead in polls. Finally, there are the men who will be challenged by women (I'm only going to include the ones that look to be close). So far, these are: 1. Dean Heller (R NV.): \"Heller is the only Republican incumbent defending a seat in a state Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton won in 2016 \u2014 bad news for him as Democratic enthusiasm surges. His opponent, Rep. Jacky Rosen (D), has posted strong fundraising numbers and is trying to press Heller for his waffling on the GOP health-care repeal and his public role in crafting the GOP tax bill.\"  Apparently, this race is a tossup, but according to RealClearPolitics, it \"could quickly shift to Lean D status.\" (https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2018/senate/nv/nevada_senate_heller_vs_rosen-6304.html) I would be grateful for any feedback that anyone has."], [49164, "2018-05-23T17:54:18Z", [0.25, 0.2, 0.18, 0.16, 0.1, 0.08, 0.03], ""], [16851, "2018-05-23T17:38:41Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.2, 0.75], ""], [5766, "2018-05-23T17:28:30Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.15, 0.75, 0.05], ""], [12879, "2018-05-23T17:13:01Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.55, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [43311, "2018-05-23T17:05:55Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "Sweet question!
