Three years after seizing control of the great alluvial plains of the Tigris and Euphrates, Islamic State (IS), which has claimed so many victims in north-western Iraq, Syria and beyond, is finally dying. American-led forces in Syria breached the old city walls of IS\u2019s capital, Raqqa, on July 4th. In Mosul, in Iraq, all but the last alleyways of the Old City were back in government hands as The Economist went to press. Finding a backdrop from which to celebrate the liberation of Mosul will be difficult, though. Between them, IS and the coalition have destroyed too many shrines and mosques to leave much of historic value, including the al-Nuri mosque dating back to Crusader times from where Mr Baghdadi proclaimed himself caliph. Gone is the Jewish quarter, the markets with their monasteries, and the lattice balconies and sculptured masonry of another Sunni silk road city. \u201cOverlooking the Tigris, there could be no nobler or more beautiful place to sit in,\u201d waxed Ibn Jubayr, a Spanish travel writer who visited in the 12th century.

Troops tied white banners and Iraqi flags to lamp posts and damaged buildings including the Hadba minaret, which the jihadists blew up in June along with the adjoining Grand al-Nuri Mosque, as air strikes and mortars rained down nearby. It was from al-Nuri's pulpit that Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared his caliphate three years ago. Authorities are planning a week of nationwide celebrations, according to a government statement, and Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi is expected to visit Mosul to formally declare victory. Mosul's fall would mark the effective end of the Iraqi half of the caliphate which Islamic State declared three years ago in parts of Iraq and Syria. The group still controls territory west and south of Mosul, where tens of thousands of civilians live. Soldiers from the elite Counter-Terrorism Service (CTS) retook the Makawi district of Mosul's Old City on Sunday, a military statement said, a few blocks from the western banks of the Tigris. Reaching the river will give Iraqi forces control over the entire city and is expected by the end of this week. A U.S.-led international coalition is providing air and ground support to the offensive, which Iraq's army and militarized police are also fighting in a multi-pronged attack. Federal police chief Lieutenant General Raed Shakir Jawdat said his forces had completed their mission in southern parts of the Old City on Saturday and those areas still needed to be cleared of explosives and corpses from two weeks of fighting. \"Unfortunately until now there are families besieged and there are many discarded enemy corpses, and unfortunately many civilians have been martyred, so we must remove them,\" he told Reuters in western Mosul. \"The areas must be cleared of bombs. We must make the areas safe so that civilians can return.\" Nearly nine months of grinding urban warfare have displaced 900,000 people, about half the city's pre-war population, and killed thousands, according to aid organizations.

Pat Work and a small team of about a dozen soldiers drove through western Mosul in two unmarked armored vehicles to warn Iraqi forces of a pressing threat: friendly fire.? The American colonel had a series of urgent face-to-face meetings with generals from the Iraqi Army, the federal police and the Iraqi special forces ahead of a major offensive Saturday morning to drive out the remaining IS positions in Mosul. American troops are taking on an increasingly prominent role in the fight. Once largely restricted to working within highly fortified Iraqi bases, U.S. commanders now travel in and around Mosul with small teams of soldiers, sharing intelligence and advising plans of attack, revealing how the U.S. role in Iraq has steadily deepened throughout the operation to retake the country's second largest city. The gains in the Old City bringing Iraqi troops closer to victory against IS in Mosul have also meant the three branches of the country's security forces are now fighting in closer quarters than ever before. Weaving in and out of civilian traffic along the city's main thoroughfares, thick plumes of black smoke from airstrikes and artillery were just visible on the horizon from Work's convoy. He explained that the new battle space and lingering communication shortcomings mean Iraqi ground troops are at increased risk of being hit by non-precision fire like mortars and artillery launched by their partner Iraqi forces \"We're helping (Iraqi forces) see across the boundaries between their different units... just helping them understand where they are and how rapidly things might be changing.\" said Work. Throughout the course of the day Work shuttled between bases, meeting with Iraqi commanders deep inside Mosul. While the U.S.-led coalition has closely backed Iraqi forces with airstrikes in a number of fights against IS, the Mosul operation is the first time U.S. troops have openly partnered with Iraqi forces on the ground within just a few kilometers (miles) frontline fighting. \"It's a very violent close fight,\" said Work, the commander of the 82nd Airborne's 2nd Brigade Combat Team who deployed to Iraq in January. \"When the bullets aren't enough the (Iraqi) commanders want to turn to high explosives which might be mortars or artillery... so understanding where the other guy is all the time is kinda rule number one, so the lethal effect is directed at the target and not accidentally at another player that's on your team.\" The various forces that make up Iraq's military have long struggled with coordination. While the Mosul operation is overseen by a joint operations command and the prime minister, forces on the ground maintain independent command structures, standards and cultures. The Mosul fight is the first time all three forces have had to cooperate in an urban environment and throughout the operation the army, federal police and special forces have faced deadly setbacks when they acted independently, allowing IS fighters to concentrate their defenses on a single front (para. 1-9).

They give people a collective identity and a pride of place\u2026 even when their borders are artificially drawn, as they were in the Middle East. However, transnational issues like religion and ethnicity often get in the way of the notion of nationalism. Those can\u2019t be contained by a country\u2019s borders. Arab nation-states are now failing in the Middle East. Their failure is mainly due to their inability to create viable political economies. Transnational issues\u2014especially the competition between the Sunni and Shiite sects of Islam\u2014however, amplify the process.\nThe Failure of Pan-Arabism\nTransnational issues have long plagued the modern Middle East. Major Arab states like Egypt, Syria, and Iraq began to flirt with pan-Arabism. It\u2019s a secular, left-leaning ideology that sought political unity of the Arab world. It promoted a kind of nationalism that defied the logic of the nation-state. Pan-Arabism failed because it couldn\u2019t replace traditional nationalism with something that had never existed in history.

The Islamic State, which is also called ISIS, has proved capable of plotting terror attacks even as it has lost significant territory. Many of its leaders have already escaped Raqqa, its capital in Syria, and have fled to other strongholds inside the country (para. 1-3). Several hundred militants remain in the city, but they are surrounded and losing more territory by the day. In Syria, U.S.-backed local forces have surrounded Raqqa and have begun an assault into the city (para. 7). But the group has also proved stubbornly resilient (para. 9). Some ISIS leaders have already fled to militant-controlled areas along the Euphrates River Valley south of Raqqa, which have become a key stronghold for the militants now that Mosul and Raqqa are under military pressure. In Iraq, ISIS fighters still control Tal Afar \u2014 a town west of Mosul in northern Iraq \u2014and desert towns in the far reaches of western Iraq. \u201cThere still remains ISIS holdouts in both Iraq and Syria,\u201d said Col.

But even as Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi made the bold assertion, deadly fighting continued in Mosul \u2014 filling field hospitals and forcing hundreds to flee. \"We are seeing the end of the fake Daesh state. The liberation of Mosul proves that,\" al-Abadi said on Twitter, using the Arabic acronym for IS. \"We will not relent. Our brave forces will bring victory.\" Across the border in in Raqqa, coalition officials predicted a long, bloody battle ahead for the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, whose fighters succeeded in completely encircling the militants' de-facto capital Thursday. U.S.-led coalition officials estimated that as many as 2,500 IS fighters remained in the city (para. 1-4). The fight for the Old City has seen some of the most difficult urban combat yet for Iraqi forces in the campaign against IS. Eight months into the Mosul offensive, IS now holds less than two square kilometers (0.8 square miles) of the city, but the advances have come at considerable cost (para. 8). Some 300 IS fighters remain holed up inside the last Mosul districts the militants hold, along with an estimated 50,000 civilians, according to the United Nations (para. 15). George, S. (2017).

But all that fades into the background as the stench of death comes closer and closer. \"Look, there.\" A guide from Iraq's Counter Terror Force points to the body of an ISIS militant that lies where it fell. The jihad is blackened and bloated from days in the scorching sun. There are several more rotting corpses scattered in the rubble. This is what is left of ISIS's prize city in Iraq -- festering dead, a few hundred yards of territory, and about 200 die-hard militants awaiting a final standoff. Senior Iraqi commanders took CNN inside the Old City in the calm before their final storm against ISIS. On the rooftop of a villa now used as a forward operating base for Iraq's Counter Terror Force, you see the consequences of ISIS's scorched-earth policy (para. 1-6).

(http://www.inherentresolve.mil/News/Article/815695/carter-hails-iraqi-fallujah-success-as-counter-isil-milestone/) \nThere seems to be a similar operation in Mosul of isolating IS militants into small areas. With the Iraqi\u2019s saying Mosul will be liberated within a few days, at the moment I can only see the US following suit if all the neighbourhoods have been retaken with no IS held areas, and therefor think its likely GJO would resolve when an official statement from Operation Inherent Resolve is released.  There is also a similarity between Mosul and Fallujah with the civilians experiencing lack of food, water and medicine. \nAt the end of 2016, negotiations led by the International Red Cross had been conducted to get ISIL to allow some aid teams to enter Fallujah and provide basic assistance. (http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/10000s-face-starvation-iraqs-fallujah-siege-tightens-1545046929) However in February 2016 the negotiations were reported as currently unsuccessful, and by June 2016 there were still reports of trapped civilians suffering from starvation (http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/fallujah-civlians-near-starvation-says-prominent-aid-group-640239838). \nIt appears that the Iraqi\u2019s have decided negotiations wouldn't work in Mosul, so there is a sense of urgency for the Iraqi\u2019s to prevent civilians from dying from starvation but also protecting them from being killed deliberately or as collateral. Col. Joseph Scrocca recently said: \"The ISF (Iraqi Security Forces) and coalition must be deliberate to protect the civilians that are still alive but quick enough to save them from starvation.

Just steps away in no-man's land stands the stump of the Hadba minaret, which towered above the city for 850 years until the militants rigged it with explosives and razed it to the ground last week. Getting this deep into Mosul's Old City means soldiers from the Counter Terrorism Service (CTS) must dismount from their armored Humvees and walk for 10 minutes down a maze of narrow alleyways which at some points are barely wider than a man. They climb through holes knocked into walls, entering abandoned homes and courtyards where detritus and concrete rubble is piled up at every turn. Construction is so dense here that vehicles cannot pass and air strikes would likely cause too much collateral damage. The battle to retake Islamic State's de facto capital in Iraq has come down to a band of soldiers with assault rifles maneuvering on foot through the dusty heart of the city. Heavy fighting in close quarters between the elite troops and Islamic State's most hardened fighters has left the Old City so damaged that it is often hard to tell the difference between what constitutes indoors and outdoors (para. 1-6).

The attacks came as Iraqi forces continue to move in on the last pocket of territory the IS militants hold in the neighborhood known as the Old City.

A silence falls, punctured only by clucking from a nearby mosque where chickens peck at the body of a dead Isis fighter. A blast shakes the ground and smoke mushrooms upwards. \u201cAmerican,\u201d says a soldier. \u201cThe big ones are American.\u201d Since Operation Inherent Resolve, the multinational mission to destroy Isis, began in 2014 there have been nearly 13,000 airstrikes. This one, on a day last week, is a direct hit, a general confirms, and congratulatory smiles are exchanged. Within minutes, they are preparing the next set of co-ordinates. In a darkened room at the back of the villa lies an Isis prisoner, hands and feet tightly bound with strips of fabric. He is an Iraqi, aged 20. Pulling him up by fistfuls of his hair, his guards pose for selfies with him. This is the northwestern edge of the final battle for Mosul, where Iraqi ground forces have started advancing into the Old City. Round-the-clock airstrikes, rockets and heavy artillery weaken the enemy before soldiers move forward house by house through booby-trapped streets overlooked by Isis snipers . \u201cDaesh [Isis] are fighting back hard, they are not retreating from any positions now,\u201d Brigadier-General Shugar Roadan Salim al-Namy said. \u201cNow they are completely surrounded, they are fighting to the death\u201d (para. 1-7). The battle in the Old City will be tough. Drone footage reveals heavy fortifications. The warren of streets and alleys is too narrow for armoured vehicles; infantry will undertake this last fight in territory rigged with Isis mines (para. 9). \u201cNo one can handle this sort of fighting easily and we cannot estimate how long it will take,\u201d said Namy. The special forces unit leading much of the nine-month Mosul offensive has reportedly lost more than 50% of its strength. In a hospital used by Iraq\u2019s elite Golden Division, an Iraqi journalist reported seeing dozens of body bags bearing war dead waiting to be transferred to Baghdad and southern Iraq, the homeland of many of the troops fighting the jihadists (para. 11). Isis retains the capacity to hit back. In a multipronged attack on long-liberated districts in west Mosul this month, Isis fighters disguised as soldiers and fleeing civilians crept along the bank of the Tigris river to ambush the federal police, reportedly killing 90 men. After 12 hours of heavy fighting, Isis withdrew. \u201cIt was a surprise attack and we took a lot of casualties. We basically lost a whole unit,\u201d admitted a policeman. \u201cIt was dark, we had no lights, and they took control very quickly. We killed some but most of them escaped, with a lot of weapons\u201d (para. 11-13). \u201cWe waited three years to get liberated from Daesh but, when we saw what happened and what is still happening now, believe it or not, we wish that we had never been liberated,\u201d said 19-year-old Abdulrahman, who survived an airstrike that killed his parents and younger brother. He lost a further 20 relatives in another airstrike three months later (para. 17). Westcott, T. (2017). Isis traps 100,000 human shields in Mosul as defeat looms. The Sunday Times. World.

U.S.-trained urban warfare units are leading the fight in the maze of narrow alleyways of the Old City, the last district in the hands of the Sunni Islamist insurgents. Iraqi authorities are hoping to declare victory in the northern Iraqi city in the Muslim Eid holiday, which marks the end of the fasting month of Ramadan, during the next few days (para. 1-3). Some 7,000 civilians were brought out of the Old City this week, the Iraqi state news website said. Several street intersections were seized during the day (para 13). \"This ... is yet another example of the horrific suffering and indiscriminate violence suffered by civilians, including women and children,\" said Jonathan Henry, MSF Emergency Coordinator for West Mosul, in a statement (para. 18). More than 100,000 civilians, of whom half are children, are trapped in the crumbling old houses of the Old City, with little food, water or medical treatment. Aid organizations say Islamic State has stopped many from leaving, using them as human shields. Hundreds of civilians fleeing the Old City have been killed in the past three weeks. RUBBLE OF \"THE HUNCHBACK\" The Iraqi government once hoped to take Mosul by the end of 2016, but the bloody campaign has dragged on as the militants reinforced positions in civilian areas, launched suicide car and motorbike bombs, laid booby traps and kept up barrages of sniper and mortar fire. The military said it had defused dozens of booby traps as troops advanced on Friday. The area still under IS control is about 2 square kilometers (0.77 square miles) in extent, alongside the western bank of the Tigris, which bisects Mosul. The fall of Mosul would mark the end of the Iraqi half of the militants' \"caliphate\" as a state structure, but Islamic State would remain in control of large areas of both Iraq and Syria  Islamic State posted a video online showing the remaining square base of the mosque's leaning minaret amid a mountain of rubble, with wrecked cars nearby (para 18-25).

D'Agata and his team swept into the Old City of Mosul with Iraqi special forces on a cloud of debris, through the twisted maze of streets where die-hard ISIS fighters have dug in. When the roads narrowed too much, they had no choice but to continue on foot. Cameras can't really do justice to the destruction of the Old City. It just goes on for miles.

But I think this would be a mistake, and I assume cooler heads will prevail.  It seems to me that the problem with declaring the city liberated while combat is still going on is that ISIS might decide to make headlines - and humiliate the Baghdad government and its allies - by conducting a high-visibility massacre of civilians in the areas it still controls. Such an event would compromise the credibility of the the Iraqi government, and possibly provoke finger-pointing and recrimination between Baghdad and its allies. Even if there is no spectacular or particularly horrific ISIS response to a premature declaration of victory, you still can't rely on the enemy to tailor his behavior to confirm the veracity of your press releases. If he can make you look like a liar and a fool, he will. So declaring Mosul liberated before it is fully liberated will induce ISIS to prove Baghdad wrong, one way or another.

Isis will continue fighting as a guerrilla force, but it will be the end of a state once the size of Great Britain and fielding a military force more powerful than many members of the United Nations. Presumably Isis decided to destroy the ancient mosque and its famous minaret, a symbol of Mosul, to prevent the Iraqi security forces triumphantly raising the Iraqi flag over a place so closely associated with Isis (para. 1). It has been an epic siege. The assault on Mosul started on 17 October last year when Iraqi ground forces, supported by the massive air power of the US-led coalition, began the operation. Iraqi and US generals expected heavy fighting on the outskirts of Mosul, but looked forward to a much quicker advance once its outer defenses were breached. This had been the pattern when government forces recaptured Ramadi and Fallujah in Anbar province west of Baghdad in earlier offensives. Exactly the opposite happened: Isis adopted different and more effective tactics based on the fluid defense of built-up areas. Instead of defending fixed points to the last man, its snipers, mortar teams and suicide bombers driving vehicles packed with explosives kept moving their positions so they could not easily be located and destroyed by aircraft and artillery (para. 4). It took three months for Iraqi forces to capture the eastern part of the city and they were to find the battle even tougher in the west. By 29 March, they had lost 774 dead and 4,600 wounded since October according to a senior US officer. Some 3,500 Isis fighters are reported to have been killed in and around the city between October and May. The government casualties are even more serious than they appear because Iraqi battle-worthy combat troops are limited in number, being mainly concentrated in the counter-terrorism services (Golden Division), federal police and the emergency response division. The soldiers used to occupy captured territory are of far more dubious quality, often belonging to Shia militias or Hashd al-Shaabi (para. 4-5). Cockburn, P. (2017).

Hackel (2017) June 22, states that: ISIS militants are cornered in the Old City. Iraqi and coalition forces are advancing slowly, capturing as little as one city block per day \u2014 if that. And ISIS fighters continue to strike back. On Wednesday, they seemed to detonate explosives at Mosul's 12th-century mosque. That iconic structure \u2014 with its famous leaning minaret \u2014 is now in ruins. Nabih Bulos, a special correspondent for the Los Angeles Times, left Mosul on Tuesday. He says ISIS is using everything it has to hold on. \"They're using everything they have,\" Bulos says. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about the use of 23mm guns, so the stuff that's used for anti-aircraft. We're talking about swarms of suicide bombers, and they're not using car bombs now because there's just no space, but they're using snipers by the ton. It's been really very hard going.\" He spoke to The World's Carol Hills on Thursday. Here are the highlights of their conversation.  Carol Hills: You were with the Iraqi army as they're trying to move in, inch by inch, to the Old City. Visualize that for us: How is that taking place?  Nabih Bulos: Essentially, it's Stalingrad-esque. Almost no building is left unharmed. So the place is a morass of masonry, and twisted metal. The soldiers are creeping along but they're also dealing with snipers and suicide bombers. So they're moving very carefully. But the problem is compounded by the fact that you have civilians, lots and lots of civilians. And the moment they see an opening many of them run toward security forces, which means that they have to struggle to actually decide who is friend or foe among the swarms who are coming to them. And that's why it's very difficult.  We're also talking about a situation where they have to call in airstrikes very often just to be able to advance. And we're talking about different groups here of the Iraqi army, but then you have the special forces groups who are doing a better job of advancing, but they have to wait for the others to secure their flanks, so really, it's been very, very hard going (para. 1-7).

The assault began at dawn, with airstrikes and a push by Iraq\u2019s counterterrorism forces into the neighborhoods of the old city. It was met with fierce resistance by Islamic State fighters, according to commanders, suggesting that the battle, the most vicious phase in the long fight for Mosul, could go on for days or weeks (para. 1-2). As the battle has unfolded, the two sides of the city, east and west, have faced different fates. The eastern side was an easier task. Declared liberated this year, the east, where the city\u2019s more well-to-do had lived, was seen as less loyal to the extremists of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL (Para. 8). Since the east was cleared of militants with relatively little destruction, a sense of normalcy has been reclaimed there, with civilians returning, schools and shops reopening \u2014 including a liquor store \u2014 and traffic clogging the streets. In the west, though, whole neighborhoods have been flattened, and hundreds of thousands of civilians now live in camps that have sprouted in the barren landscapes surrounding the city. The battle has tested humanitarian aid groups and added to the crisis that has engulfed Iraq since 2014, when the Islamic State captured Mosul and swept across the north, west and center of the country. Since then, 4.8 million Iraqis have fled their homes, and today about three million have been unable to return home, according to the United Nations  Humanitarian groups have been warning for weeks about the perils to civilians in the old city, where the United Nations believes up to 150,000 people are trapped, running low on food and water and held by Islamic State fighters as human shields in the face of advancing security forces (Para. 8-11).

The militants first sneaked into the western Dandan neighborhood at dawn from the Tigris River and took over a mosque, where they used loudspeakers to announce the assault and shouted \"God is greatest!\" before it was bombed from the air, according to an army officer and a police officer.

But it didn't happen. Instead, the military is still struggling to eject a militant group that has shown renewed determination and ferocity than expected despite being heavily outnumbered. On Sunday, Iraqi forces began to storm one of the gateways into the final bastion held by the Islamic State, or ISIS, in Mosul: the \"Old City.\" \"They are fighting much harder than before,\" said Rebin Rozhbayane, a former officer and trainer with the Iraqi army who was near the front lines in western Mosul over the past few weeks (para. 1-4). Liberating the Old City is the most difficult part of the offensive because of its narrow streets and densely clustered buildings. These conditions prevent the use of armored vehicles and create a high risk of ambushes, booby traps and civilian casualties (para. 8). The big prize in the Old City is the al-Nuri mosque, where ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi made a public speech in 2014 after the militants captured Mosul. Recapturing the city would mean a symbolic end to the Islamic State's reign in Iraq. Iraq's federal police forces came within hundreds of yards of the mosque in March and hinted at the time that they would take it shortly. However, the widely publicized deaths of hundreds of civilians in U.S.-led bombing raids forced a change in strategy. Iraqi forces decided to surround the Old City first and then open corridors for civilians being used as human shields to escape. \"The biggest challenge is to kill the (ISIS fighters) while making a safe way out for civilians,\" said Muntader Khazem, a sergeant with the Emergency Response Division, the elite unit of the federal police Para. 8-11).

Heavy ordnance, such as 500-pound (227-kilogram) air-delivered bombs, are causing excessive and disproportionate damage to civilian life and property, which is prohibited under international humanitarian law, organizations including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and the Center for Civilians in Conflict warned. Their combined report released Thursday also pointed to the use of artillery systems, including heavy mortars and locally fabricated rocket launchers that lack a guidance mechanism, and are therefore inherently imprecise and indiscriminate (para. 1-3). The use of powerful and often inaccurate weapons is problematic because a very large number of civilians \u2014 as many as 180,000, according to the United Nations \u2014 remain in the IS-controlled areas of the city, now little more than 1.5 square miles (4 square kilometers). The situation is made more difficult by IS\u2019 practice of using civilians as human shields and stopping people from leaving (para. 7). \u201cIt\u2019s well known that the houses there are very old, the missiles weigh over 200 kilos (440 pounds), it hits the house and when it hits one house the next four or five houses will collapse with it too,\u201d he said in his hospital bed in Irbil (para. 12). Military analysts say that Iraqi and coalition forces rely on these weapons because they are trying to minimize their own casualties, which have been considerable. According to a recent U.S. Defense Department report, Iraqi special forces have suffered a staggering 40 percent casualty loss in Mosul so far. The U.S.-led coalition estimates that its airstrikes unintentionally killed at least 484 civilians between the start of the Mosul campaign and June 2. Airwars, the United Kingdom-based non-governmental organization that monitors airstrikes, believes the real number may be as high as 3,800. These numbers do not include the number of people who have been killed by artillery shelling, for which there is no reliable estimate (para. 12-14). Szlanko, B. (2017).

Eight months into the Mosul offensive, Islamic State (IS) militants have been dislodged from all of the city except an enclave along the western bank of the Tigris river. IS's grip on the Iraqi side of the northern region along the border with Syria, a desert area where Iraqi and U.S. sources believe IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is hiding, has been ebbing as forces fighting on the side of Iraq's government have advanced. The Iraqi air force provided cover for the thrust into Baaj of the Shi'ite paramilitaries known as Popular Mobilization, said a statement from the Iraqi joint operations command. Popular Mobilization is steered by neighboring Shi'ite regional power Iran, an adversary of the United States, but is playing a part in the campaign to defeat Islamic State, an enemy of both, in Mosul and the surrounding province of Nineveh. Iraqi government armed forces are focusing their effort on dislodging insurgents from remaining pockets in Mosul, since 2014 Islamic State's de facto capital in Iraq. While reporting nominally to Iraq's Shi'ite-led government, Popular Mobilization has Iranian military advisers, one of whom died last month fighting near Baaj. Securing border territory between Iraq and Syria is important for Iran to reopen a land route to supply Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's army with weapons in his protracted war with rebels and militants (para. 1-8).

Speaking with VOA via Skype from Baghdad, Brigadier General Rick Uribe, the deputy commanding general for U.S.-led coalition forces in Iraq, said the \"level of desperation\" from IS fighters was rising. \"They know they're about to lose,\" Uribe said, \"so their goal is to inflict as many casualties, not only in the Iraqi security forces but on any innocent victims and anybody that's left.\" Uribe told VOA many of the remaining IS militants were the \"toughest fighters left\" and had used their time in the city to build weapons caches, booby traps and tunnel systems. According to Uribe, the fighters continue to take hostages in their attempts to bait the coalition into striking civilians. They also are destroying as much infrastructure as possible, he said, to make it more difficult to get the western part of the city up and running once they've been defeated there. Car bombs Coalition spokesman Colonel Ryan Dillon told reporters Thursday that the \"weapon of choice in Mosul\" continued to be vehicle-borne bombs. \"With the car bomb threat in mind, the government of Iraq directed civilians not to use cars or motorcycles to avoid being mistaken for militants,\" Dillon told Pentagon reporters during a phone call from Baghdad (para. 1-7). But fleeing can be a deadly decision for the 80,000 to 150,000 citizens trapped in the three remaining IS-controlled neighborhoods. Dillon said IS fighters were shooting some civilians as they fled, and that other citizens had died after accidentally stepping on explosive devices while trying to leave the area (para.9). Dillon said about 4,000 Mosul citizens had fled each day recently, but that the number had drastically declined in the last 48 hours. U.S. Central Command, which overseas American military operations in the Middle East, said in a news release Friday that coalition strikes had resulted in 132 additional unintentional civilian deaths, raising the total number of civilians killed by coalition strikes between August 2014 and May 2017 to at least 484. March airstrike Last week, a U.S. military investigation into a deadly March airstrike found that a secondary explosion had caused the deaths of more than 100 civilians in Mosul (para. 9-12). \"There is no military force in the world that has proven more sensitive to civilian casualties,\" U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis said shortly after the strike. \"We go out of our way to always do everything humanly possible to reduce the loss of life or injury among innocent people.

Today, another war is raging to defeat a darker empire in Iraq\u2014the Islamic State (ISIS)\u2014and it is nearing a conclusion that generals say is only \u201ca matter of time.\u201d On Sunday, Iraqi security forces began their final push to drive unswerving ISIS militants from their last pockets of control. Seven months of battle\u2014longer than Stalingrad\u2014and Baghdad\u2019s forces, backed by the U.S.-led coalition, have slowly eaten away at the jihadi group\u2019s stranglehold on the largest city in its possession. In the city\u2019s liberated east, footage shows that life is now returning, as are residents to their homes amid shuttered shops daubed with graffiti jihadi slogans. But on the west bank of the Tigris, something more sinister is happening. ISIS is brutalizing the civilians remaining under its control, and scorching the institutions it cannot retain, including hospitals, as it retreats into its last districts in and around the dense Old City. U.S. Army Major General Joseph Martin, head of ground forces for the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS, tells Newsweek of the complex, unique offensive that Iraqi forces are facing head-on as the Mosul endgame nears. \u201cThe ISF (Iraqi Security Forces) continue to march, cornering neighborhoods, setting conditions for the eventual liberation of the west side of Mosul,\u201d says Martin, who presides over several thousand U.S. personnel in Iraq, which includes advisers, training staff and special forces, who coordinate with the Iraqi military. \u201cThey\u2019ve got ISIS in position where it\u2019s just a matter of time until we see the final collapse of the caliphate within west Mosul. They are completely surrounded.\u201d Martin declines to give an estimated date for Mosul\u2019s liberation but says Iraqi forces now have the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of neighborhoods in west Mosul, limiting ISIS\u2019s \u201cflexibility and freedom of movement\u201d to the Old City and pockets north of that area. Martin says this tightening of the noose in Mosul has weakened ISIS, restricting its use of mortars, suicide bombs and even chemical weapons. \u201cThere are very few places they can shoot [mortars] from,\u201d he says. On chemical agents, which the group have used more than a dozen times in and around Mosul, he says if they were to use them now, it would \u201caffect themselves\u201d as well as Iraqi forces. The battle for the city half the size of Philadelphia is taking place in tight roads and alleyways, with each neighborhood carrying a different urban terrain, new surprises and a certain \u201crandomness that\u2019s unique to the Old City,\u201d Martin, speaking by phone, says. Iraqi forces are now stationed just 200 meters, the general says, from the Al-Nuri Mosque, the symbolic heart of the group\u2019s crumbling semi-state, where its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared himself the caliph of the world\u2019s Muslims in July 2014. \u201cThey will choose when they want to do that and, of course, there\u2019s a certain amount of symbolism in that,\u201d Martin says when asked for a timeframe of the capture of the mosque complex, which ISIS fighters are tightly defending. But, before then, the U.N. estimates that some 200,000 civilians remain and could still flee the city, with 700,000 already escaping the brutal street-to-street fighting. ISIS\u2019s control of the civilian population allows its fighters to slow the battle\u2014as it has already done with sniper fire, mortars and vehicle suicide bombs\u2014using them as cannon fodder. Added to its mass graves and crucifixions of civilians, hanging them from street furniture such as lampposts, ISIS is putting Mosul\u2019s residents in the crosshairs of the coalition. Not to prevent the targeting of the group\u2019s key buildings, but to drive the coalition to strike them, Martin says. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to see the level of inhumanity that Daesh is willing to exercise in order to achieve their outcomes,\u201d he says, using an Arabic acronym to describe ISIS. \u201cThey are taking people, putting them in basements of a building and welding the steel doors shut so they can\u2019t get out. They are...getting us to strike those buildings\u201d (para. 1-12). Moore, J. (2017). The Final Push for Mosul: Matter of Time\u2019 Until ISIS Flag Falls in Iraq\u2019s Second City. News Week.

Islamic State claimed responsibility for a blast outside a popular ice-cream shop in Baghdad just after midnight that Iraqi officials said killed at least 14 people and injured 30 others. The Sunni extremist group said it sought to kill Shiites in the Karrada neighborhood, which has been targeted by major bombings in the past. In a separate attack, hours after the ice-cream shop explosion, a car bomb was detonated outside the main pension office in Baghdad, killing at least 10 people and injuring around 30, Iraqi officials said. No group claimed responsibility for the bombing. After dark, a group of Mosul residents no longer under Islamic State control gathered to mourn the victims with a candlelight vigil. People in the town of Hit, in Anbar Province, also gathered to light candles in memory of the victims. A man wearing a suicide vest detonated himself at a security checkpoint near the mourners in Hit, killing 14 and injuring 23, including a group of Iraqi soldiers and a colonel, according to Mohaned Mohamed al-Hiti, head of Hit\u2019s local council. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. The attacks came days after the Iraqi military began another phase of the campaign against Islamic State militants in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul after months of brutal house-to-house combat. \u201cThe Daesh terrorist group attacks people during Ramadan days, this is evidence of how evil this group is,\u201d Interior Minister Qassim al-Araji said, using another name for Islamic State. \u201cEverything has a price and this is the price of freedom,\u201d he said. The holy month of Ramadan is a time of prayer and spiritual reflection for many Muslims, who fast during daylight hours. Some extremist groups such as Islamic State, however, claim killing enemies is noble and worthier during the period. Iraqis usually spend time with family and friends during Ramadan, often crowding restaurants and cafes late into the night after breaking their fasts (para. 1-10). Adnan, G. & Kesling, B. (2017).

The strikes came as forces fought to retake the last areas held by the Islamic State group in their former stronghold of Mosul. The first IS-claimed car bombing struck a Baghdad ice cream shop during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, when Iraqis often stay out late shopping or socializing after breaking their daily fast (para. 1-3). - 'Wanton savagery' - The US State Department said in a statement that it condemned the Baghdad bombings in \"the strongest possible terms\" (para. 14). \"These brutal attacks, whose victims included innocent children breaking the Ramadan fast and elderly Iraqis collecting their pensions, demonstrate once again the wanton savagery of the enemy we face,\" spokeswoman Heather Nauert said. The UN called the bombings an \"outrage\" while Paris turned off the lights of the Eiffel Tower on Tuesday night in tribute to the victims. The bombings in Baghdad come as Iraqi forces fight to retake the last IS-held areas of Mosul, a city that was the jihadist group's emblematic stronghold. Iraqi forces are more than seven months into a massive operation to recapture the city, and have already taken back its whole eastern side and much of the west. Three neighbourhoods north of Mosul's Old City -- Al-Shifaa, Al-Saha and Al-Zinjili -- are now the target of a broad assault by Iraqi soldiers, police and special forces that was launched last week. IS is mainly relying on \"snipers and suicide bombers\" to target Iraqi forces, as it is running low on mortar rounds and explosives after losing sites it previously used to produce them, Iraqi Brigadier General Shakir Kadhim Mohsen told AFP. The United Nations has warned that up to 200,000 civilians who are believed to remain in IS-held areas of the city are in grave danger and that large numbers could flee. \"We are deeply concerned that right now, in the last final stages of the campaign to retake Mosul, that the civilians... in (IS) areas are probably at graver risk now than at any other stage of the campaign,\" Lise Grande, the UN humanitarian coordinator for Iraq, told AFP (para. 14-22).

The territory, dotted with small villages and dusty roads, is home to key supply lines into neighboring Syria and connecting Iraq\u2019s north to the capital Baghdad. Control of the Iraqi-Syrian border would be a key strategic prize for the mostly Shiite paramilitary forces and their backer Iran, who also supports the government of Syrian President Bashar Assad. One division of the Iraqi government-sanctioned paramilitary group known as the Popular Mobilization Forces first reached Iraq\u2019s border with Syria on Monday after securing a string of small villages west of Mosul and south of Sinjar, according to Ahmed al-Asadi, the group\u2019s spokesman.  \u201cThis will be the first step to the liberation of the entire border,\u201d he said. The PMF began Monday\u2019s operation by pushing IS militants out of the center of the town of Baaj, some 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the Syrian border. Once the town was retaken a unit was dispatched to secure the village of Um Jrais along the border. \u201cThis victory will also be an important incentive for the Syrian Arab Army to secure the entire border from the Syrian side,\u201d al-Asadi said, referring the Assad\u2019s government forces. As the PMF secure more of the border region, they plan to \u201cerect a dirt barricade and dig a trench,\u201d said Sheikh Sami al-Masoudi, a paramilitary group leader. Iraq\u2019s border with Syria has long been a haven for smugglers and insurgent activity. The Nineveh foothold would give the paramilitary forces considerable leverage politically and militarily in Iraq after the fight against IS is concluded, according to Maria Fantappie, the senior Iraq researcher for the International Crisis Group, a non-governmental research firm. \u201cThe Iranians have been prioritizing something that the U.S. has overlooked: control over strategic roads, rather than control of the Sunni communities,\u201d Fantappie said explaining that the U.S.-led coalition\u2019s fight against IS has largely focused on retaking cities while the PMF have instead focused on transit and supply lines. Control of roads and borders also allows the paramilitary forces to divide Iraq\u2019s Sunni community geographically and politically, Fantappie said. \u201cThey have been trying to bisect Iraq and prevent a unified Sunni block from emerging,\u201d she said. More than 150 kilometers (93 miles) away from the PMF\u2019s border advance, Iraqi military and police forces are slowly closing in on the last pockets of IS control in Mosul\u2019s Old City. Iraqi commanders say the grueling fight that is now in its eighth month is in the final stage, an operation that the United Nations warns will likely put the more than 100,000 civilians still trapped by IS inside Mosul at severe risk. In Syria, Assad\u2019s forces and their allies have also been on the offensive, moving toward the Iraqi and Jordanian border, but are still far from reaching it.

According to residents interviewed by The Associated Press, many families are trapped in their homes by IS with the doors welded shut; the extremists have also repeatedly targeted fleeing civilians with small arms fire and mortars.

Mosul was the terrorists' last urban stronghold. Snipers and suicide bombers fighting for the so-called \"Islamic State\" (IS) jihadist group targeted combatants and civilians alike in the Iraqi city of Mosul on Sunday. The terrorists seemed determined to fight to the last amidst a government push to completely retake the city. Mosul had been the last major IS stronghold in Iraq, but recent offenses have cornered the jihadists into select pockets of the old city. Despite this, they continued their campaign of suicide car bombings and snipers placed on rooftops to making the fighting difficult in the neighborhoods they control, already a challenge because of the narrow streets and dense civilian population. There were \"sporadic\" clashes on Sunday, according to Baghdad, and at least two military officers were killed in fighting near the Tigris River in the city's Shafaa neighborhood. On Saturday, however, US-backed Iraqi forces were able to take control of key territory as they try to surround IS from three different directions. They were able to capture the Ibn Sina hospital, which is also in the Shafaa neighborhood, providing them access to a major medical complex that the terrorists have controlled since they swept through the city in 2014. Since Friday, the government has been working to get civilians out of the targeted areas, dropping leaflets to alert citizens to \"safe passages\" where they could flee with the help of \"guides, protectors and (transportation).\" US admits high non-combatant casualties The push to protect civilians came as the US military was receiving heavy criticism for the amount of civilian deaths caused by its coalition against IS.

Anwar Gargash, UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, made his comments on Twitter less than a week after Saudi Arabia and the UAE signaled frustration at Qatar. Its state media published purported remarks by Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani criticizing Gulf rhetoric against Iran and suggesting strains between the emir and U.S. President Donald Trump. Tensions have been rising between Iran and its Gulf Arab neighbors, who accuse Tehran of trying to expand its influence in Arab countries including Syria and Yemen. Qatar denied making the critical comments, saying its news agency had been hacked, but Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates allowed their state-backed media to continue running the story, angering Doha. \"The Gulf Cooperation Council countries are passing through a new sharp crisis that carries within it a great danger,\" Gargash said. \"Fending off sedition lies in changing behavior, building trust and regaining credibility,\" he added, without mentioning Qatar by name. Gulf countries have made no official comment on the rift, which emerged after Trump's first visit to Saudi Arabia and his meetings with Arab and Muslim heads of state since he took office. But a war of words had escalated between Qatari media on one side and Saudi and Emirati media on the other. The row appears to emanate from old accusations made in 2014 that Qatar backs Islamists outlawed by Saudi Arabia and the UAE as terrorist organizations. Ties between Qatar and some of its GCC allies suffered an eight-month breakdown in 2014 over Qatar's alleged support for the Muslim Brotherhood, the political ideology of which challenges the principle of dynastic rule. The rift ended after what diplomats said at the time was a promise by Qatar to the UAE that the Muslim Brotherhood would not be allowed to operate from the country. Gargash said that the road to resolving any crisis \"between someone and his brothers was to have true intentions, abide by commitments, change the behavior that had caused damage and turn a new page\". \"Our position and our stability is in our unity and to have honest intentions,\" he added (para. 1-11).

The leaflet drop, announced in an Iraqi military statement, signaled that the decisive offensive to dislodge the militants from their remaining enclave in the northern Iraqi city was imminent. The U.S.-backed offensive on Mosul, now in its eighth month, has taken longer than planned as the militants are dug in among civilians, fighting back with booby traps, suicide cars and motor-bikes, snipers and mortar fire. Civilians trapped behind Islamic State lines face a harrowing situation with little food and water, no electricity and limited access to hospitals (para. 1-4). The militants have laid sheets of corrugated metal over pebbles in the alleys as an early warning system, residents said. The grinding noise produced by treading on it would alert them to any troop movements or civilians trying to escape (para. 9).

The International Institute for Strategic Studies, a think-tank in London, reckons that countries in the Middle East and north Africa make up eight of the top 15 spenders on defence when measured as a share of the national pie. \nOne problem is that much of this money is wasted. Billions are splurged on flashy gear like jet fighters or submarines that look impressive but may not be appropriate to the kinds of conflicts they are fighting. Such toys are also hard to maintain. And widespread theft and corruption mean that a lot of kit disappears, or is kept in the barracks (which is one reason why IS was able to nab so much in Iraq). Less priority is given to command and control, logistics and intelligence-gathering. Plans lack flexibility and are adhered to even when they don\u2019t work. That is exacerbated by the lack of authority given to junior and non-commissioned officers, the glue in most Western armies. Their deference to seniority is the norm in Arab society, but leaves small units unable to act quickly without waiting for approval. An even more serious weakness is that armed forces in the Arab world simply don\u2019t function as neutral, professional institutions like their Western counterparts. They are often more loyal to a ruler or an ethnic or religious community than to the state: Syria is an example of the former, Libya and Yemen, riven by tribal and regional loyalties, of the latter.

Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Friday that the Iraqis had suffered heavy losses during the Mosul operation, with about 980 killed and more than 6,000 wounded (para.9). The Islamic State holds only about five square miles of Mosul, including the Zanjili neighborhood and the Old City. The Old City is the site of the Great Mosque, where the Islamic State\u2019s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, declared a \u201ccaliphate\u201d in 2014 across parts of Iraq and Syria. Both Zanjili and the Old City are far more cramped that the rest of Mosul, with narrow side streets and alleys that will restrict Iraqi vehicle movement and give Islamic State fighters a clear advantage when it comes to launching their signature bomb-laden suicide vehicles. The close quarters will probably force Iraqi troops to rely more heavily on their own resources rather than U.S.-led airstrikes and artillery. Aside from airstrikes, U.S. and other coalition forces are providing a range of other assistance to Iraqi forces, including flying small hand-launched drones to help spot targets for advancing forces, as well as providing counter artillery radar and drone-jamming equipment to stop the Islamic State\u2019s own unmanned aircraft (para. 9-12).

Iraqi authorities and aid agencies are already struggling to cope with a surge in displacement since security forces opened a new front against the militants in Mosul earlier this month. Backed by a U.S.-led coalition, Iraqi forces have dislodged Islamic State from all but about 12 square km (five square miles) of the city and are seeking to claim victory before the holy month of Ramadan in less than two weeks. The militants, however, still control the Old City, where they are expected to make their last stand in the densely populated, narrow streets that are impassible for armored vehicles. Military commanders say the aim is to raise the Iraqi flag over the Old City's Nuri mosque, from which Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi proclaimed a caliphate, so the battle can be declared won even if pockets of resistance remain. \"As military operations intensify and move closer to Mosul\u2019s Old City area, we expect that up to 200,000 more people will flee,\" Lise Grande, the UN's Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq, said in a statement, describing the figures as \"alarming\". \"The numbers of people who are moving are now so large, it\u2019s becoming more and more difficult to ensure civilians receive the assistance and protection they need.\" The displacement is also complicating the advance of Iraqi forces, according to Brigadier General Ali al-Sharifi of the Federal Police forces, which are fighting in the 17 Tammouz district. \"We didn't expect such a flux of thousands of families fleeing toward our forces. We slowed clashes to give them safe routes and we had to prepare hundreds of trucks to evacuate them. It's not an easy situation\". Among those freed from Islamic State on Thursday were two girls from the Yazidi minority who had been held captive since the militants overran their villages nearly three years ago, federal police chief Lieutenant General Raed Shaker Jawdat said in a statement (para. 1-10).

The ostensible goal of the permanent U.S. presence is to train Iraqi forces and to prevent a resurgence of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) after the anticipated fall of its last stronghold in Mosul, Iraq\u2019s second-largest city. That number dropped to 40,000 before complete troop withdrawal in 2011. Iraqi forces are struggling to retake the last remaining Mosul neighborhoods IS holds in the city\u2019s western half, but even after a territorial victory, Iraqi and USA -led coalition officials have warned of the potential for IS to carry our insurgent attacks in government held territory. Many have been leaving the Musherfa district of western Mosul after US-backed Iraqi forces took it from ISIS on Friday, hoping to reach the relative safety of the eastern banks of the river. At least two people were killed and six injured when multiple ISIS suicide bombers attacked a base in northern Iraq where U.S. military advisers are stationed, security sources said on Sunday. The US-led coalition has been backing Iraq\u2019s forces during an eight-month offensive to recapture Mosul, Iraq\u2019s second city, from IS, which seized it in 2014. The front lines in western Mosul have inched forward for months as IS fighters have used a claustrophobic battle space and hundreds of thousands of civilians as human shields to slow Iraqi troops. In Iraq, the government forces are facing stiff resistance from Islamic State today in their fight to take control of Mosul. Iraqi forces now seem to be moving closer to the Old City in apparent anticipation of an operation to clear it.

The helicopter was hit while supporting Iraq's mostly Shiite militia forces in an operation to retake villages still held by the militants in the sprawling desert to Mosul's west, Brig. Gen. Yahya Rasool, the command's spokesman, said in a statement. The source of the attack was ground fire, the pilot landed safely and there were no fatalities, he added. The government-sanctioned Shiite militia forces known as the Popular Mobilization Units launched an operation to retake a small village just south of Sinjar on Friday. Inside Mosul Iraqi forces backed by the U.S.-led coalition are slowly closing in on a small cluster of neighborhoods in the city's west held by the extremist group. The operation to retake Mosul was launched in October, the city's east was declared liberated in January and Iraqi forces launched the operation to retake the west the following month. The U.S.-led coalition does not provide air cover for operation led by the Popular Mobilization Units. The last time an Iraqi helicopter was shot down was in April, and the crash killed both pilots. In addition to coalition air support, Iraqi air force and army aircraft conduct regular strike operations over the city to support police and special forces units battling IS (para. 1-6).

Moments later, the militants entered through a window, lay low for a few minutes, then fired their weapons. The plan was simple. They would draw attention to the house by firing from the windows, then move to an adjacent building through a hole in the wall, in hope of goading coalition jets flying above to strike the house. What the militants did not realize was that U.S. advisers partnered with Iraqi troops were watching the whole thing on an aerial drone feed. No air strike was called - and the propaganda coup Islamic State would have reaped from the deaths of innocent people was averted. \"We automatically knew what they were trying to do. They were trying to bait us into destroying this building,\" said U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel James Browning. \"This is the game that we play, this is the challenge that we go through every day.\" The challenge is only increasing as U.S.-backed Iraqi forces squeeze the militants into a smaller and smaller area of Mosul, where they are now trapped along with several hundred thousand civilians. \"There is nowhere to go.... the battlefield is much more complicated with the amount of civilians that are moving,\" Browning said. The risks are high: more than 100 civilians were accidentally killed in a single airstrike by the U.S.-led coalition in March.

Mosul bombing survivors recall how house packed with civilians became death trap AP (2017) May 2, states that: Survivors and witnesses of a US airstrike in Mosul that killed more than 100 civilians have told journalists the building they were living in was not an Islamic State group target. The bombing was the deadliest single incident in the months-long battle for the Iraqi city. After the strike, US officials suggested Islamic State group militants may have crammed the building with people, booby-trapped it with explosives, then lured in an airstrike by firing from the roof. \"Armed men in the house I was in? Never,\" Ali Zanoun, one of only two people in the building to survive the March 17 strike, told the Associated Press. He spent five days buried under the rubble of the building, drinking from a bottle of nose drops, with the bodies of more than 20 members of his family in the wreckage around him. Increased use of bombardment has made the fight for Mosul's western sector, which began in mid-February, dramatically more destructive than fighting for its eastern half. More than 1,590 residential buildings have been destroyed in western Mosul, based on analysis of satellite imagery and information from local researchers, the UN said last week. Airstrikes killed 1,254 people in western Mosul in March and April alone, according to Iraq Body Count, an independent group documenting casualties in the war, cross-checking media reports with information from hospitals, officials and other sources. In comparison, an estimated 1,600 civilians were killed or wounded from all causes during the 100-day campaign to recapture Mosul's less densely populated eastern half, which ended in mid-January. Official casualty figures from the Pentagon are far lower \u2014 it said over the weekend that it had confirmed coalition airstrikes killed at least 352 civilians in Iraq and Syria combined since the campaign against IS started in 2014. 'My entire family is gone' The AP spoke to seven witnesses, including neighbors\u2019 and people who had been in the house, all of whom said no-one was forced into the building, where dozens had taken refuge. They told the news agency the militants did not rig the building with explosives. During his days under the rubble, Mr Zanoun said he heard people and fighters outside, along with the sound of gun battles and more airstrikes (para 1-14). AP News.

According to Iraqi forces on April 30th there are still between 200-300 ISIS fighters in Mosul (http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-mosul-idUSKBN17W0DG), where as Col John Dorrian, spokesman for the International Military Coalition fighting ISIL, said on April 27th \u201cup to 1000 IS fighters remain\u201d. (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/27/isil-using-foreign-fighters-atrocities-mosul/). Given the vast difference in figures here: either 700-800 IS militants have been killed in 3 days (I don\u2019t think this happened) or its psychological warfare. \nThe latter being backed up by a recent news article, where an Iraqi military source disclosed the \u201cnew plan\u201d to attack ISIS: \u201cThe plan supported by the international coalition, according to the source, states giving the militants a chance to get out to the desert in southwest of Mosul to besiege them there.\u201d (http://www.iraqinews.com/iraq-war/mosul-battle-concluded-may-15-source/)  I still think its possible that Mosul will be retaken by the end of June as the estimated number of ISIS fighters at the start of the campaign was 8000, down to - lets say - 1000 in 7 months. The pressures increasing with ISIS surrounded, supplies will eventually run low and the US are still conducting air strikes. \n(https://www.defense.gov/News/Article/Article/1161065/pentagon-spokesman-updates-iraq-syria-yemen-operations/)"], [368, "2017-04-30T14:02:11Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2017-04-30T12:42:42Z", [0.0, 0.51, 0.48, 0.01, 0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-04-30T06:58:07Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.9, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [15237, "2017-04-30T03:09:46Z", [0.0, 0.75, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [368, "2017-04-29T19:10:16Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [25875, "2017-04-29T16:23:31Z", [0.0, 0.7, 0.3, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2017-04-29T12:35:15Z", [0.0, 0.57, 0.42, 0.01, 0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-04-29T06:55:49Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.9, 0.0, 0.0], "U.S. Military Identifies \u2018Mustard Agent\u2019 As Chemical Used by ISIS Against Iraqi Troops Jones (2017) April 27, states that:\n\n(CNSNews.com) \u2013 Last week, a U.S. military spokesman said ISIS \u201cused chemicals in the vicinity of Mosul\u201d in an attack on Iraqi Security Forces.

So that's electronic warfare capabilities.\"  Dorrian refused to give details about how that works, \"but we can move capabilities where they need to be in order to stop the enemy from being more effective.\" Dorrian said the Iraqi security forces \"have turned the tables and begun to use them (drones) as well\u201d to take out snipers and vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices that are parked \u2013 and to just sort of terrorize them (para. 1-7).

Jihadists who have travelled from abroad to join Islamic State in Iraq and Levant (Isil) are being used as a final line of defence because of their indifference towards local residents, the international military coalition has alleged. Col John Dorrian, spokesman for the international military coalition fighting Isil, said on Thursday that up to 1,000 Isil fighters remain in Mosul, down from an estimated 8,000 at the start of the campaign. They include a \u201csignificant group\u201d of foreign jihadists. He said the foreign fighters were often committed to fighting to the death and felt little solidarity with the residents of the Iraqi city. He said: \u201cOne of the things we have seen repeated throughout the campaign is that as Isil leaders begin to leave areas that they expect to lose, what they like to do is to leave foreign fighters behind, because foreign fighters have no reluctance whatsoever to treat civilians that are in the area very, very poorly and to use the scorched earth tactics that we have seen before. \u201cWhat we are seeing now in the centre of Mosul is Isis using things like chemical weapons, they are using brutal control measures, they are executing people for trying to leave. These are the types of things that are very easy to do when it\u2019s not your neighbors or people you have grown up with.\u201d Several hundred Britons are estimated to be still inside Isil\u2019s self-styled caliphate and up to 150 are believed to have been killed fighting with jihadist groups in Iraq and Syria in the past five years (para. 1-7).

Clambering onto a rooftop with a small group of soldiers from Iraq\u2019s counterterrorism service, we scanned the Islamic State\u2019s stronghold in western Mosul as one of its armored car bombs maneuvered toward the front line. Within minutes, there was an enormous explosion \u2014 a shoot of red flame and a funnel of black smoke that reached into the sky. This time, at least, there were no friendly casualties. The Iraqi troops who were clawing their way forward in the streets below had piled enough debris ahead of them that the suicide driver was stopped short of his target. All over the city, you can see that kind of wreckage and ad hoc barriers, put up by both sides. Every day, for weeks, the battle to take western Mosul from the Islamic State has looked like this: a block-by-block crawl as casualties\u2019 mount (para. 1-5). The plight of civilians appears to be worsening by the day, adding to commanders\u2019 urgency to find some edge against the Islamic State here (para. 7). The Iraqis do not have the luxury of conducting a siege: Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has told his generals that dragging out the Mosul operation, now in its seventh month, would work only to the advantage of the Islamic State, which many in the West call ISIS or ISIL, but the Iraqis call Daesh. This was not the mission that American military commanders envisioned for the counterterrorism service when they established it after the United States invasion in 2003. The force\u2019s original mission was to conduct lightning raids against terrorists and insurgents (para. 7-9). None of this was lost on ISIS, which flew a reconnaissance drone over and sent a scout on a motorcycle to try to find the Iraqis\u2019 position. Two American Black Hawk helicopters could be seen flying in the distance (para. 18). For hours, the two sides traded machine-gun fire. Young soldiers lugged heavy canisters of ammunition to the rooftop. An aide to General Saadi, who used binoculars to monitor the fight and typed updates into the iPad, said that many of the Islamic State forces they had been battling were foreign fighters. From the bodies the Iraqis had recovered, he said, it appeared that many had not bathed in weeks. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a social life,\u201d he said dismissively. \u201cThey just come here to fight and die.\u201d Eventually, enough seemed to be enough, and an American airstrike was called in to quell some of the enemy resistance. An Iraqi machine-gunner poured on the fire. ISIS would not be silenced. A sniper fired a round toward the covered landing where the stairwell reached our rooftop, figuring that Iraqi spotter and other personnel might be lingering inside. It was a good guess: That is where the general\u2019s aide and a few other journalists and I were sheltering. But we were low to the ground. The round was high and struck the back wall, splattering plaster, dust and tiny beads of glass into the air. One Iraqi cameraman took off his shirt to shake off the residue. A battalion commander in a nearby counterterrorism unit was not so lucky that day: He was shot in the chest by a sniper and died (para. 18-25). Gordon, M., R. (2017).

Explosions from two car bombs could be heard nearby as Lieutenant General Abdul Ghani al-Assadi spoke to Reuters at his command post on Monday, and a Reuters correspondent saw thick smoke rising from the blasts. \"Most houses in the Old City are very old and its streets and alleyways are very narrow,\" Assadi, a commander of Iraqi counter-terrorism units in Mosul, said. \"So to avoid civilian losses we are using siege, but that does not mean we will not enter the Old City.\" Assadi said his units were refraining from engaging enemy forces in positions where the militants were holding civilians as human shields. \"Using very careful methods and considerations, we will liberate our people from Daesh,\" he added, referring to an Arab acronym of Islamic State. Government forces have surrounded the militants in the northwestern quarter including the Old City, home to the Grand al-Nuri mosque where their leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, declared a \"caliphate\" over parts of Iraq and Syria. The ultra-hard-line Sunni Muslim fighters are countering the offensive using booby traps, suicide motorcycle attacks, sniper and mortar fire, occasionally shells filled with toxic gas. With food and water supplies becoming scarcer in neighborhoods of Mosul still under IS control, up to half a million people are believed to be trapped there, including 400,000 in the Old City alone, according to United Nations estimate.

Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq, told Reuters last week fighting in the Old City could lead to \"a humanitarian catastrophe, perhaps the worst\" in the three-year war to evict Islamic State from Iraq. International aid organizations have estimated the civilian and military death toll at several thousand since the U.S.-backed offensive by government forces to retake Mosul began in October. More than 330,000 people have been displaced so far, according to the International Organisation for Migration (para. 1-10). Aboulenein, A. (2017).

Gen. Abdul-Amir Yarallah, from the Joint Operations Command (JOC), as saying in a statement. The recapture of al-Seha would enable the troops to initiate another push in the adjacent neighbourhoods of Zanjili, Warshan and Rifa'i in Mosul. The latest push by the troops is part of a slow push toward the western and northwestern edges of Mosul's densely populated old city centre, where roughly 400,000 residents are believed to still be trapped under IS rule. Meanwhile, the troops' advance has hardly moved for more than a month at the edges of the old city centre as the federal police and interior ministry special forces, known as Rapid Response, have been fighting heavy back and forth battles against the IS in the narrow streets in the old neighborhoods around the historical al-Nuri Mosque in the middle of Mosul's city centre. The troops progress in the old city centre is much slower than the early phases of the offensive due to the stubborn resistance of IS militants, in addition to the orders to the troops that restricted heavy bombing and increased sniper fire against the militants holed up in densely populated areas to reduce civilian casualties (para. 1-6).

Iraqi forces recaptured the eastern side of Mosul in January after three months of fighting with Islamic State, and sat on a new offensive in February to retake the western region. Commanders said earlier this month that the Islamic State was controlling only less than seven percent of Iraqi territory, and that only six districts were still witnessing IS presence (para. 4). Islamic State has lost many of its senior commanders since operations launched to retake the western side of Mosul.

U.S.-backed Iraqi forces have made progress extracting Islamic State fighters from their last redoubts in the northern city of Mosul, but the battle has descended into a frustratingly bloody affair at its six-month milestone with brutal street-by-street combat. Iraqi and coalition forces have been building steady momentum against the Islamic State in a series of hard-fought battlefield victories since the massive assault to retake Mosul began in October, the top U.S. ground commander, Army Maj. Gen. Joseph Martin, said Wednesday. \u201cThey\u2019ve got the equipment they need, they\u2019ve got the momentum they need and that\u2019s why they\u2019re making progress each and every day,\u201d Gen. Martin told reporters during a teleconference from coalition headquarters in Baghdad (para. 1-4). Iraqi forces, backed by U.S. and coalition heavy artillery and air power, rode the campaign\u2019s early momentum across the Tigris River and into the teeth of the Islamic State\u2019s heavily fortified stronghold of eastern Mosul in January, weeks after completely flushing its fighters from the western portion of the city (para. 7). But the Islamic State\u2019s devastatingly effective weapons and tactics \u2014 including chemical weapons and conversion of commercial drones and hand grenades into flying bombs \u2014 coupled with Mosul\u2019s labyrinthine urban landscape has largely stopped that momentum. In the months since breaking into the city\u2019s eastern districts, the offensive\u2019s progress has bogged down significantly into the toughest urban fighting U.S. forces have seen since World War II, said Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, the top U.S. commander in Iraq.\nAmerican and coalition firepower, which was key to the Iraqi forces\u2019 rapid advance in western Mosul, has also been stymied by the Islamic State group\u2019s use of Iraqi civilians as human shields to frustrate coalition airstrikes.\nU.S. and coalition warplanes were forced to temporarily scale back their operations after a string of strikes was blamed for hundreds of civilian casualties. Roughly a half-million Mosul residents have fled the fighting, filling nearby refugee camps already inundated from previous fighting.\nOn Wednesday, Gen. Martin said the bloodshed would likely escalate as Iraqi ground forces and their coalition allies brace for the endgame in western Mosul.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s left is a tough fight through some very complicated terrain that will require a significant amount of tenacity and commitment,\u201d the general said. \u201cBut I assure you, the Iraqi Security Forces are up to that task\u201d (para. 7-12).

Mosul traces its history to the 25th century B.C., and for 13 centuries it was ruled by Assyrians, becoming at one time an even grander city than Babylon. Then known as Nineveh, and located 30 kilometers north of modern Mosul, it was a key city in Mesopotamia, a cradle of civilization that is credited with such profound developments as the invention of the wheel, the first planting of cereal crops and the first use of cursive script. The origins of modern medicine and mathematics can be traced to the city. Early Sumerian inhabitants were among the first to pose existential questions such as: Who are we? Where are we? How did we get here? These helped to shape ancient Greek philosophy and, subsequently, our modern world. But the Pearl of the North, like the whole of Mesopotamia, has also seen more than its share of devastating wars that pitted tribes, races, religions, countries and empires against each other in terrible cycles of conflict, revenge and retaliation. The word Mosul means \"linking point\" and, sitting astride a route linking northern Mesopotamia with Anatolia, it has lured conquering armies (para. 1-3). Dettme, J. (2017).

The Iraqi forces, with coalition support, are making significant progress every day in the increasingly tough fight for Iraq's second-largest city, Army Maj. Gen. Joseph M. Martin told Pentagon reporters via video conference from Baghdad. Martin, the commanding general of Combined Joint Forces Land Component Command Operation Inherent Resolve, highlighted the Iraqi forces' strength and resolve. \"They continue to improve their capability and demonstrate a level of professionalism that makes me proud to serve with them,\" he said. \"It's only a matter of time before they liberate the rest of Mosul and defeat ISIS in Iraq.\" ISIS's capability and cohesion as an organization are weakening, and the terrorists are under pressure throughout Iraq, Martin said. \"ISIS is reeling from defeat after defeat across the country,\" he added. \"Their leadership has fled, and their days are numbered.\" The Iraqi forces and their coalition partners are committed to the fight, Martin stressed (para. 1-6). ISIS Using 'Inhumane Tactics' The terrorists have indiscriminately attacked innocent civilians, and are using increasingly inhumane measures to terrorize, injure and kill residents, the general said. Those brutal tactics include hostage-taking and using improvised explosive devices, mortars and rockets against the population, Martin explained (para. 8). Tough Fight Remains The enemy is surrounded, Martin pointed out.

Mosul, Iraq's second biggest city, was captured by the Sunni Muslim fighters in 2014, but government forces have retaken much of it during a six-month operation. The advance has hardly moved for more than a month, though, as the militants are holding out in the densely populated Old City in western Mosul, where tanks and heavy vehicles are not able to operate because of its narrow streets. Iraq's federal police moved forces 200 meters deeper into the Old City, getting closer to al-Nuri mosque, a statement said. The mosque is highly symbolic because it was there that Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared himself head of a self-proclaimed caliphate (para. 1-5). Daesh suicide motorcycles now are their favorite weapon inside the Old City,\" he said, using a derogatory name for Islamic State. \"We have to watch every single house to avoid attackers on motorcycles packed with explosives\" (para.8). Iraqi government forces, backed by U.S. advisers, artillery and air support, have cleared the east and half of western Mosul and are now focused on the Old City.

Tough close-quarters fighting in heavily-populated areas of Mosul is still ahead, and IS also holds territory in other parts of Iraq, as well as in neighboring Syria. The jihadists will still be able to carry out attacks in Iraq even if they no longer control significant territory, while the impact of the war -- widespread displacement of civilians, cities and towns devastated by the fighting, countless lives disrupted -- will last long after the fighting ends. Iraqi forces and the US-led coalition supporting them \"are nearing the end of the operation to recapture Mosul,\" said Patrick Martin, Iraq analyst at the Institute for the Study of War. But \"the final neighborhoods will be the most difficult to recapture, especially the Old City and the remaining neighborhoods in northwestern Mosul,\" Martin said. Progress in the Old City -- a warren of closely-spaced buildings and narrow streets where hundreds of thousands of civilians are thought to reside -- has been difficult and slow. \"You cannot get vehicles in there, so it's gotta be a dismounted operation,\" Brigadier General Rick Uribe, a senior coalition commander, said of the Old City.\nThat \"makes it very difficult for any offensive maneuver in there, but it makes it very easy to defend,\" Uribe said. \"Sometimes, 50 meters (yards) is a great day,\" he said of the Iraqi advance. Iraqi forces launched the Mosul operation in October, moving toward the city from the south, west and north before assaulting its eastern side, which was recaptured earlier this year. Two special forces units -- the Counter-Terrorism Service and the Rapid Response Division -- have spearheaded the fighting inside Mosul, while soldiers and police have also taken part (para. 1-11).

Government forces have retaken much of Iraq's second-largest city since January but have been trying since then to dislodge the Sunni Muslim militants from the densely populated Old City in western Mosul, their last Iraqi stronghold. \"Iraqi security forces continue to progress as they liberate the western side of Mosul,\" U.S. Army Major General Joseph Martin, head of ground forces for the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State, said by telephone. He declined to say whether the militants would be defeated rather within weeks or months, saying: \"It's hard to tell because the terrain changes literally every day.\" Martin said Iraqi forces had surrounded Islamic State positions but it was not always possible to move vehicles into all parts of the Old City with its narrow streets. \"Some days like yesterday (there was) significant amount of progress, other days there is not much progress but progress nevertheless,\" he said. Iraqi officers have said snipers have slowed them down in western Mosul in the biggest ground operation in Iraq since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein. \"It's very complicated,\" Martin said. \"The terrain literally changes from neighborhood to neighborhood ... the nature of the enemy, how the population reacts.\" He also said coalition forces continued to provide air support for Iraqi forces despite an explosion that followed an air strike that was believed to have killed scores of civilians on March 17.

The soldiers expect the militants to fight to the death. \"Daesh fighters are resisting on a professional level because they have no escape routes left,\" said a second policeman Hussein Qassem, using an Arabic acronym for the militants. \"They are resisting until they are killed. God willing we will not leave any Islamic State fighters. We will fight till the end.\" But advances are hard-won and fragile. On Thursday, members of the Federal Police co-leading the advance said it was not safe to go to Mosul museum, which they had retaken three weeks ago (para. 1-10).

Its pretty clear that in the age of mobile phone videos and 24/7 news coverage, and the use of the internet to get propaganda messages shown, that the sort of illegal behavour that soldiers used to get away with in wars a few year ago will come back to haunt the reputation of the military. Winning faster control of Mosul at the cost of reputational loss  will not make America Great Again. History tends to remember the massacres and slaughter of civilians; particularly history as told in places like the middle east. So if anyone is planning to get long term peace, they had better avoid a Shia or Kurd on Sunni war crime.  I think the military is very well aware of this. So my guess is that they will move slowly and carefully.\nI accept that the situation in Aleppo was different, but only a little. From reports it seems the civilian population initially supported ISIS, before (so they say) changing their minds when they saw how ISIS treated them. I doubt that the locals can do much except to try and hide or get out. Those locals who joined ISIS probably realize that if they put down their arms now they are probably not going to be any more likely to survive than if they keep fighting. In other wars lynch mobs are not kind to their fellow citizens who have occupied their city. While it might be possible to stop war crimes by organized  troops, civilian revenge will still take place. \nThe option for ISIS of retreating to Raqqa is not very attractive; they have to get there; and once there they know that they could face Russian and Syrian aim power that will not be so picky about collateral damage, as well as US air power. The ISIS leader will probably do what leaders usually do, try to run and hide, while foot soldiers make a futile stand. \nOf course I could be completely wrong and it will be over next week.

The U.S. is deploying an additional 240 soldiers to Mosul, likely to support a final push through the Old City. The ISF has also slowed its operation out of continued concerns of civilian casualties throughout the western Mosul operation. Humanitarian concerns flared when local sources claimed that a Coalition airstrike on March 17 killed as many as 200 civilians. Meanwhile, Iran is deepening the role of its proxy Badr Organization in Ninewa Province to influence the post-ISIS security and political structure in the province. The Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) slowed its offensive in central Mosul on March 26 out of concern for the estimated 400,000 civilians remaining in the Old City. The ISF continues operations in the outer neighborhoods, but has largely paused the offensive into the Old City. Local sources claimed that a Coalition airstrike on March 17 killed as many as 200 civilians in the adjacent New Mosul neighborhood. The Coalition confirmed that it conducted a strike in the area on March 17, however the strike may have set off ISIS VBIEDs or rigged houses near the strike, which caused the bulk of casualties. U.S. officials insisted that the Trump Administration has not loosened the rules of engagement for airstrikes. The Obama Administration in December 2016 had allowed Coalition advisors' on the ground to directly call in airstrikes in order to improve precision. International human rights groups have criticized the Coalition for not making sufficient effort to prevent civilian casualties, however. A UN official stated that at least 307 civilians have died in western Mosul so far, the majority in the March 17 airstrike. ISIS is deliberately complicating the Coalition\u2019s ability to conduct airstrikes by using the civilian population as human shields. The ISF is opening a second front to isolate the Old City, rather than working through it, in order to maintain pressure on ISIS and avoid civilian casualties. Units are advancing along the Old City\u2019s western edge towards the Great Mosque, which they will likely seek to retake before turning inward. The ISF could also increase pressure on ISIS by positioning the 9th IA Division, which completed the recapture of Badush Sub-District on March 26, to breach Mosul from the northwest. U.S. officials announced on March 27th the deployment of 240 additional troops from the U.S. Army\u2019s 82nd Airborne Division, likely in order to accelerate the defeat of ISIS in Mosul. The troops have likely already arrived. This deployment is not likely a response to the March 17 airstrike, as the force is tasked with force protection and IED clearance, but it could still further enable airstrike precision. Iraqi political backlash against the March 17 airstrike could slow or constrain Coalition efforts, however. Sunni political leader Osama al-Nujaifi called for an \u201cimmediate end\u201d to airstrikes in Mosul on March 24. A reduction in Coalition airpower in Mosul would increase the risk to ISF and U.S. forces by making them more vulnerable to ISIS tactics such as SVBIEDs (para. 1-4). Anagnostos, E. (2017).

The close-quarters fighting is focused on the Old City surrounding the mosque, where Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi proclaimed a caliphate nearly three years ago across territory controlled by the group in both Iraq and Syria. Thousands of residents have fled from IS-held areas inside Mosul, the militants' biggest remaining stronghold in Iraq. But tens of thousands more are still trapped inside homes, caught in the fighting, shelling and air strikes as Iraqi forces backed by a U.S.-led coalition advance in the west. Helicopters circling west Mosul strafed IS positions beyond the city train station, the site of heavy back-and-forth fighting in recent days, and thick black smoke rose into the sky, Reuters reporters on the ground said. Heavy sustained gunfire could be heard from the Old City area, where militants are hiding among residents and using the alleyways, traditional family homes and snaking narrow roads to their advantage, fleeing residents say. \"Federal police forces have imposed full control over the Qadheeb al-Ban area and the al-Malab sports stadium in the western wing of Old Mosul and are besieging militants around the al-Nuri mosque,\" federal police chief Lieutenant General Raed Shaker Jawdat said in a statement.

BBC (2017) March 29, states that: The civilian death toll has risen in Mosul as the battle to evict so-called Islamic State (IS) fighters from the western part of the city has intensified. Some of the stories and eye-witness accounts are horrific. US General Stephen Townsend - who heads the campaign against IS - has described the fighting there as \"the most significant urban combat to take place since World War Two\". Much of the attention is focusing on an episode in Mosul in which a strike on a building - which the US military authorities have now pretty well accepted that they hit - precipitated the collapse of the whole structure, with the loss of dozens or perhaps even hundreds of lives. A senior US Air Force general has been put in charge of the inquiry into what happened and US personnel have visited the site to take samples. But already Gen Townsend has insisted that \"the munition[s] that we used should not have collapsed an entire building\". All sorts of theories are suggested as to what might have happened. Iraqi sources are quoted as saying that IS had gathered people together in the building as human shields. Maybe - as in other cases - the structure was rigged with explosives that were in turn detonated by the air strike. As yet there is no adequate explanation of the cause of the tragedy or a reliable estimate of the death toll. Some have pointed to a potential change in the US \"rules of engagement\", the strict criteria and procedures that govern the decision to strike any target. It seems there have indeed been changes to these rules over recent months - described as \"relatively minor\" by senior US commanders. These, it seems, are a reflection of the shift away from a defensive campaign to a more dynamic offensive battle.

As investigators probe the blast, Lieutenant General Stephen Townsend strongly defended U.S. behavior in the war and pushed back against accusations the United States had loosened safeguards meant to protect civilians as it ramps up the battle against Islamic State. Still, he said increases in casualties were to be expected as the war against the insurgents entered its deadliest phase in the cramped, narrow streets of Mosul's Old City. \"It is the toughest and most brutal close-quarters combat that I have experienced in my 34 years of service,\" Townsend told Pentagon reporters, speaking from Iraq. \"What has not changed is our care, our caution ... our tolerance from civilian casualties - none of that has changed.\" Rights group Amnesty International has said the high civilian toll in Mosul suggested U.S.-led coalition forces had failed to take adequate precautions to prevent civilian deaths. Investigators combed through the rubble left by a March 17 explosion in al-Jadida district in west Mosul, where Iraqi forces backed by U.S.-led coalition air strikes are fighting to clear Islamic State militants from Iraq's second city. One line of investigation is whether Islamic State rigged explosives that ultimately caused the blast that destroyed buildings. One estimate put the death toll at more than 200 people. \"My initial assessment is that we probably had a role in these casualties,\" Townsend told a Pentagon news briefing, speaking by teleconference. \"Now, here's what I don't know.

Eyewitnesses from Mosul and Iraqi officials have said last week's strike on Islamic State targets may have collapsed homes where rescue officials say as many as 200 people were buried in the rubble. The U.S. military does not intend to change the way it carries out strikes, even as the fighting in Mosul enters more densely populated areas, Colonel John Thomas, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command, told reporters. \"General Votel is not looking into changing the way we operate other than to say our processes are good and we want to make sure we live by those processes,\" Thomas said. General Joseph Votel heads Central Command. \"There (are) only so many people dedicated to this who really have the expertise to get us where we need to be,\" Thomas added. The Mosul strike, if confirmed, would be one of the deadliest single incidents for civilians in recent memory in any major conflict involving the U.S. military, which prides itself on efforts to limit civilian fallout. Thomas said the assessment is looking at 700 videos from the area over a 10-day period. \"We didn't have any reports internally where we thought we had killed any civilians. We saw the reports come out just like, I think, like everybody else,\" Thomas said. Rescue workers are still searching the site of the March 17 explosion in Western Mosul, where one health official said 160 bodies had been recovered. Iraq's military says 61 bodies have been pulled out so far.\nThe civilian death toll has increased in the more densely populated west of Mosul as militants have used homes for cover. \"The absolute default in every building should be that there are going to be civilians present,\" said Jay Morse, a senior military adviser at the Center for Civilians in Conflict, a U.S.-based advocacy and research group.

The American confirmation followed a decision by Iraqi government forces to pause their drive to recapture west Mosul on Saturday because of the high rate of civilian casualties, a security forces spokesman said, a move apparently motivated by the incident. With fighting intensifying to recapture Mosul, around half a million civilians remain in Islamic State-held areas in the west of the city, complicating use of air strikes and heavy artillery to drive the hard line militants from their last major stronghold in Iraq (para. 1-3). Mosul municipality chief, Abdul Sattar al-Habbo, who is supervising the rescue, said 240 bodies had been pulled from the rubble of collapsed buildings. Previous estimates from local officials had said around 130 people had died (para. 7). The United Nations also expressed its profound concern, saying it was \"stunned by this terrible loss of life\". U.S. Central Command, which oversees U.S. military Middle East operations, said on Saturday that a review determined that U.S.-led coalition operation, requested by the Iraqi government, had struck Islamic State fighters and equipment \"at the location corresponding to allegations of civilian casualties\" (para. 7-9). The speaker of the Iraqi parliament, Salim al-Jabouri, said in a statement: \"What's happening in the west part of Mosul is extremely serious and could not be tolerated under any circumstances\"(para.12). Up to 600,000 civilians are still believed to remain in IS-held areas of Mosul, a challenge to the government offensive tactically but also politically as the Shi'ite Muslim-led government seeks to avoid alienating people in the mainly Sunni city \"(para.12-13). \"The recent high death toll among civilians inside the Old City forced us to halt operations to review our plans,\" a Federal Police spokesman said on Saturday. \"It's a time for weighing new offensive plans and tactics. No combat operations are to go on \"(para.16). The offensive to drive Islamic State out of Mosul, now in its sixth month, has recaptured the entire eastern side of Mosul and about half of the west.

U.S. Army Brigadier General John Richardson, a deputy commanding general in the coalition, said the solution could lie in a change of tactics. \"They (Iraqi forces) are looking at opening another front to force ISIS to fight on two directions and isolate the Old City, so when it is time to go into the old city, potentially they surrender,\" he told Reuters.

But it will not, magically, bring peace to Iraq. At the moment, the offensive has been stalled by fierce IS resistance in Mosul's Old City. But the jihadists in Mosul cannot survive long-term in the face a formidable coalition, with elite Iraqi forces supported by an American-led air operation, and backed by a lot of political will. It will not necessarily be the end of \"Islamic State\" in Iraq, though their pretensions to having a caliphate have been shattered. Last summer IS were driven out of Falluja, near Baghdad. Days later their answer was an enormous bomb attack in the centre of Baghdad that killed hundreds. With their mini \"state\" in ruins, IS may well leave behind cells to concentrate on big bomb attacks. There is also the question of all the other conflicts that smolders and often explode in Iraq. The desire to destroy IS has forced different groups to swallow their differences. The coalition includes elite Iraqi forces, Shia militias with strong ties to Iran, Kurdish peshmerga forces and Sunni tribal fighters. Once IS has been beaten there is a risk that they may turn on each other to fight for the spoils, or that old arguments will re-ignite. Violence runs like a virus through the bloodstream of Iraqi politics. The Kurds took advantage of the collapse of the Iraqi army in 2014 to seize big swathes of territory that they had coveted for generations. It is hard to see them voluntarily giving it all up. Revenge will be a factor. IS jihadists have done a lot of killing in and around Mosul in the last three years. Survivors of their pogroms might want to inflict some rough justice. Mosul is a Sunni city. The Shia-led government in Baghdad has a long history of ignoring or threatening Sunnis. Some of them here say they were relieved when in 2014 the government army was driven out by a Sunni coalition including tribes as well as IS. Haji Saad al Jabouri, a 50-something father of five, said he thought it was a Sunni tribal uprising against a bad government until IS jihadists started what he said was a reign of terror, ordering civilians around in the accents of North Africa and Saudi Arabia. \"We used to die a thousand times a day. It was hell, poverty and disease-ridden. It was indescribable. We were so scared we used to hide our children and wives from IS every day,\" he said. \"People who didn't support Daesh [IS], or pay allegiance to them, or who carried a mobile phone, were hanged all day at traffic lights then killed and burned. They hanged them also on bridges for a month or two until you could see their bones\" (para. 1-10). Bowen, J. (2017). Freed from IS tyranny, Mosul Sunnis fear for the future. BBC. World. Middle East.

If confirmed, the series of airstrikes would rank among the highest civilian death tolls in an American air mission since the United States went to war in Iraq in 2003. And the reports of civilian deaths in Mosul came immediately after two recent incidents in Syria, where the coalition is also battling the Islamic State from the air, in which activists and local residents said dozens of civilians had been killed. Taken together, the surge of reported civilian deaths raised questions about whether once-strict rules of engagement meant to minimize civilian casualties were being relaxed under the Trump administration, which has vowed to fight the Islamic State more aggressively. American military officials insisted on Friday that the rules of engagement had not changed. They acknowledged, however, that American airstrikes in Syria and Iraq had been heavier in an effort to press the Islamic State on multiple fronts. Col. John J. Thomas, a spokesman for the United States Central Command, said that the military was seeking to determine whether the explosion in Mosul might have been prompted by an American or coalition airstrike, or was a bomb or booby trap placed by the Islamic State. \u201cIt\u2019s a complicated question, and we\u2019ve literally had people working nonstop throughout the night to understand it,\u201d Colonel Thomas said in an interview. He said the explosion and the reasons behind it had \u201cgotten attention at the highest level.\u201d As to who was responsible, he said, \u201cat the moment, the answer is: We don\u2019t know.\u201d Iraqi officers, though, say they know exactly what happened: Maj. Gen. Maan al-Saadi, a commander of the Iraqi special forces, said that the civilian deaths were a result of a coalition airstrike that his men had called in, to take out snipers on the roofs of three houses in a neighborhood called Mosul Jidideh. General Saadi said the special forces were unaware that the houses\u2019 basements were filled with civilians. \u201cAfter the bombing, we were surprised by the civilian victims,\u201d the general said, \u201cand I think it was a trap by ISIS to stop the bombing operations and turn public opinion against us.\u201d General Saadi said he had demanded that the coalition pause its air campaign to assess what happened and to take stricter measures to prevent more civilian victims. Another Iraqi special force officer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject, said that there had been a noticeable relaxing of the coalition\u2019s rules of engagement since President Trump took office. Before, Iraqi officers were highly critical of the Obama administration\u2019s rules, saying that many requests for airstrikes were denied because of the risk that civilians would be hurt. Now, the officer said, it has become much easier to call in airstrikes. Some American military officials had also chafed at what they viewed as long and onerous White House procedures for approving strikes under the Obama administration. Mr. Trump has indicated that he is more inclined to delegate authority for launching strikes to the Pentagon and commanders in the field. This is the second time this week that the military has opened an investigation into civilian deaths reported to have been caused by American airstrikes. On Tuesday, Central Command said it was investigating an American airstrike in Syria on March 16 that officials said killed dozens of Qaeda operatives at a meeting place that activists and local residents maintain was part of a religious complex (para. 1-13).

The exact cause of the collapses was not clear, but a local lawmaker and two local residents said air strikes by the U.S.-led coalition targeting Islamic State militants may have detonated a truck filled with explosives, destroying buildings in a heavily populated area. Civil Defence chief Brigadier Mohammed Al-Jawari told local reporters that rescue teams were retrieving bodies from under the debris in the Mosul Jadida district near Rahma hospital, the site of heavy fighting between Iraqi forces and Islamic State. Reports of numbers of civilian casualties varied greatly after last Friday's air raid. But Jawari was quoted by al-Mosuliliya channel in a statement saying teams had so far recovered 40 bodies from buildings that collapsed. \"Finding survivors is very difficult because the area is completely destroyed,\" he told reporters. \"It's a very big disaster, indeed we can describe it as a disaster.\"\nThe coalition did not give details on any specific air strike or comment on a Mosul Jadida district operation. \"We are aware of reports on airstrikes in Mosul resulting in civilian casualties. The Coalition conducted several strikes near Mosul and we will provide this information to our civilian casualty team for further investigation,\" the coalition said in a statement. One Iraq official put the total casualties at more than 137. Bodies were believed to be still buried inside collapsed homes. \"A coalition air strike hit a residential street last Friday and destroyed at least 30 houses,\" a police civil defense official said. \"We halted rescue operations today for lack of heavy equipment, jack hammers and trucks to remove debris\" (para. 1-9).

Gen. Matthew Isler says the \u2018risk calculus\u2019 has not changed. Shinkman (2017) March 23, states that: A top general overseeing the U.S.-led coalition's air campaign against the Islamic State group pushed back Thursday against claims warplanes under his command are being less discriminate in preventing civilian deaths, following reports earlier in the day that airstrikes in Mosul killed more than 200 civilians and that civilian casualties have risen under the administration of President Donald Trump. Air Force Brig. Gen. Matthew Isler, a deputy commander for the coalition's air power, tells U.S. News that fighting in Iraq's second-largest city has intensified to unprecedented levels now that fighters from the Islamic State group are surrounded and that their leaders and foreign comrades have fled. \"The density of the local fighting for those ground forces has changed,\" Isler said from the coalition headquarters in Baghdad, describing the dangers facing the Iraqi security forces on the ground in Mosul. \"What has not changed is our support, our diligence in making sure we are taking the appropriate levels to make sure we are avoiding any harm to innocent civilians.\" Isler specifically said the risk calculus \u2013 the number of civilian casualties acceptable to war planners, at times including the president, when considering missions \u2013 has not changed. Local media reports on Thursday indicated as many as 230 civilians were killed in a U.S.-coalition airstrike on a part of Mosul where the Islamic State group is defending itself against the continued onslaught of the Iraqi military and its elite special operations unit, the Counter Terrorism Service. That news followed other reports earlier in the day that an increase in the intensity of the fighting against the Islamic State group has resulted in a sharp uptick in civilian casualties. Isler declined to comment on the latest report of civilian casualties out of Mosul, citing an ongoing investigation into the incident. But he said the area specified in the reports of the strikes is within 500 meters of Iraqi security forces' positions. Public concerns have risen under the new administration of a potential increase in what the U.S. considers acceptable civilian casualties. As a candidate, Trump pledged to \"bomb the s---\" out of the Islamic State group and once advocated for killing known family members of terrorists because they hide behind civilians. The Defense Department says it investigates every claim of civilian casualties it deems credible, usually by analyzing surveillance footage leading up to the strike, of the strike itself and its aftermath. A Pentagon review released in January said U.S. strikes have accounted for 188 unintentional civilian deaths since the campaign against the Islamic State group began in 2014. The nonprofit transparency project AirWars.org, which tracks coalition strikes, puts this number at more than 2,700 (para. 1-10). Shinkman, D. (2017).

Nebehay and Markey (2017) March 23, states that: About 400,000 Iraqi civilians are trapped in the Islamic State-held Old City of western Mosul, short of food and basic needs as the battle between the militants and government forces rages around them, the United Nations refugee agency said on Thursday. Many fear fleeing because of Islamic State snipers and landmines. But 157,000 have reached a reception and transit center outside Mosul since the government offensive on the city's west side began a month ago, said Bruno Geddo, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) representative in Iraq. \"The worst is yet to come. Because 400,000 people trapped in the Old City in that situation of panic and penury may inevitably lead to the cork-popping somewhere, sometime, presenting us with a fresh outflow of large-scale proportions,\" he said. Fighting in the past week has focused on the Old City, with government forces reaching as close as 500 meters to the al-Nuri Mosque, from where Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared a caliphate spanning parts of Iraq and Syria in July 2014. The hard-line militants are now on the back foot, with their stronghold in Syria also under attack. But they still hold an estimated 40 percent of western Mosul and the campaign to recapture it could yet take weeks. The government halted offensive operations on Thursday morning due to cloudy weather, which makes it difficult to bring in air support. Later, Federal Police reinforcements moved toward the Old City and the troops were preparing to storm the area and retake the mosque, a police spokesman said (para. 1-6). Nebehay, S. & Markey, P.

The 17-year-old, his parents and siblings took cover in his aunt's house next door, and for the next half hour they huddled in a back room as the battle raged overhead. Then the airstrikes came, blowing up a cluster of houses, killing not only the fighters, but 18 members of Khudair's extended family. The teen was one of the few to survive, left covered in burns and shrapnel wounds. The fight for the western half of Mosul could the deadliest yet for civilians. Iraqi forces have increasingly turned to airstrikes and artillery to clear heavily populated, dense urban terrain, and residents running out of food and supplies are fleeing their homes at higher rates than previously seen in the Mosul operation. More than 750 civilians have been killed or wounded since the fight for western Mosul began a month ago, front-line medics say, a number they expect to spike as Iraqi forces push into the old city. They spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations. By comparison, some 1,600 civilians were killed or wounded during the 100 days of fighting to recapture Mosul's less densely populated east, according to reports from nearby hospitals. Mosul's east was declared fully liberated in January. Airwars, a London-based group that tracks civilian deaths from airstrikes targeting IS in Iraq and Syria, estimates the number of casualties to be much higher, claiming more than 300 civilians have been killed in western Mosul over the last month. The Pentagon, which has yet to release casualty figures from the last month, has acknowledged 220 civilian deaths from coalition airstrikes in Iraq and Syria since the U.S. campaign against IS began in 2014. Of the nearly 300,000 people who have fled Mosul since the operation to retake Iraq's second largest city began in October, more than 100,000 have left in the past month alone, according to the United Nations (para. 1-8).

The black Islamic State flag still flew from the mosque's minaret on Sunday, Reuters reported (para. 11).

At least 3,500 civilians have already perished in western Mosul since the beginning of the latest offensive, according to prominent Iraqi politician, Khamis Khanjar (para. 15). The death toll, impossible to verify amid the chaotic battle, somehow corresponds with estimates of an independent monitor group, Airwars, which believes at least 2,590 civilians have likely been killed by the US-led coalition in Iraq and Syria. The US military, however, tends to stick to more conservative figures, saying that only around 220 civilians have been killed by the coalition since the start of operations against IS in 2014 (para. 15-17).

Five months into the battle to take Islamic State's last bastion in Iraq, government forces have cleared the east and half of western Mosul, and are now focused on controlling the Old City as well as the strategic al-Nuri Mosque. As fighting, has entered into the narrow alleyways and densely populated parts of the west, more residents are fleeing liberated areas where food and water are scarce, security fragile and where homes are often caught in shelling. \"We have been trapped for 25 days. No water, no food, everyone will die and they will have to pull us from the rubble,\" said one resident of Bab Jdid district, not giving his name because relatives remained inside Mosul. Families with elderly relatives and children marched through western Mosul's muddy streets, past buildings pock-marked by bullet and bombs. Some said they had hardly eaten in weeks, scrambling for supplies handed out by a local aid agency.\n\"It is terrible, Islamic State have destroyed us. There is no food, no bread. There is absolutely nothing,\" said another resident. As many as 600,000 civilians may be caught inside the city with the militants (para. 1-7). Boumzar, A. (2017).

By the time, they reached Reuters journalists it was clear that their cargo was far more precious, and more tragic. One man lifted a grubby, fluffy blanket to reveal the dust and blood-covered body of a child, one of several piled up on the cart. \"This is my son. He is gone,\" he said, describing how his family's home had been hit by an air strike. Iraqi helicopters have been pounding west Mosul with missiles as its troops push into Islamic State's last holdout in Iraq. \"This happened because of air strikes. These were in their homes and the air strikes killed them,\" the man said, showing other small bodies, cut by shrapnel or debris, on the cart.

They place their faith in precision missiles which can hit their target with great accuracy. But human instinct also comes into play against an Islamic State enemy which has used civilians as human shields and hides in houses and mosques. \"Our mission is to find and destroy ISIS. We are not here to kill the wrong people,\" said Captain Lucas Gebhart, commander of the 4/6th Cavalry's Bravo Troop of Apache attack helicopters. The troop is based at this airfield about 60 kms south of Mosul, as is a rocket battery which fires into west Mosul (para. 1-4). \"The west side is very congested and it will present new challenges for us. We realize the need to be careful as we go forward,\" Gebhart said (para. 9). One of those challenges is avoiding civilian casualties in a conflict where fighters are mixed in among the population and sometimes hiding behind them. \"Everyone that flies with me are fathers and husbands, so we are very deliberate to avoid casualties we don't want. We use guided missiles. The things we shoot from an Apache, they go where we want them to go,\" Gebhart said. Targets are identified and approved by the Iraqi army. But circumstances can change in a moment. \"I have personal experience of human shields. I engaged a target and they pulled a family of women and children out of a house. The missile was already in the air but I was able to move it,\" he said. \"You've got a little bit of time. If something happens post-missile release, we have procedures to move it \" (para. 9-14). The issue of civilian casualties has dogged the U.S. military during its long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, from shootings at check-points to drone bombings. In the battle for Mosul, Iraqi and U.S.-led coalition war planes have also been pounding parts of the city (para. 25). MacSwan, A. (2017).

The fighters are also building tunnels inside private homes and using residents as human shields, Iraqi and American commanders say.\nUnlike militants from Mosul, many foreign fighters and Iraqis from other parts of the country are unable to quit and blend in with civilians who are fleeing the city by the thousands.

The decision on whether to create a more rapidly deployable Kuwait-based force is part of the ongoing review of the United States' strategy to defeat Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, where around 6,000 U.S. troops are deployed, largely in advisory roles, the officials said (para. 10). RAQQA BATTLE LOOMS Trump's push against Islamic State in Syria could soon present him with an unenviable decision on whether to risk alienating NATO ally Turkey by relying on the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, which, in addition to Arabs, includes Kurdish YPG fighters (para. 14).\nAnkara views the YPG as the Syrian extension of the Kurdish PKK militant group, which has fought an insurgency in Turkey's southeast since 1984 and is considered a terrorist group by both the United States and the European Union. A senior Turkish official said on Tuesday that the United States had decided to go with the YPG, instead of agreeing to Ankara's call for it to instead back Syrian rebels that Turkey has trained and led against Islamic State for the past year. The comments came on the same day that the top U.S. military officer, Marine General Joseph Dunford, met his Turkish counterpart in the southern Turkish province of Antalya. A U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Dunford did not inform his Turkish counterpart of any decision about the Raqqa offensive, in remarks that appeared at odds with the Turkish account. In a sign of advancing U.S. preparations for Raqqa, an American official said on Wednesday that a small group of Marines have entered Syria (para. 14-19). Stewart, P. (2017).

Some 200,000 people remain displaced from Mosul\u2019s east and west sides since the operation to retake the city from Islamic State began in October, according to the United Nations agency that helps displaced persons, refugees and migrant workers. On its outskirts, workers are building new camps to accommodate the continued exodus. People carried newborns while men pushed old women in wheelbarrows on the road out of Mosul Monday as Iraqi forces seized another western neighborhood from the militant group, continuing their advance toward the city center. Thousands of people walking out of embattled neighborhoods were forced to cross a boulevard known as Baghdad Street, as militants likely a few hundred yards away targeted a key intersection with mortar fire. Iraq\u2019s military announced its ground offensive to drive Islamic State from west Mosul, its remaining urban stronghold in Iraq, on Feb. 26 after a weeks-long pause following victory in the east.\nResidents who had been living under Islamic State rule for more than two years poured out to aid stations and camps. The militants forced people into urban areas for use as human shields and punished those who tried to leave, according to locals and officials. UNHCR, the U.N.\u2019s refugee agency, has 10 camps near Mosul that can still host thousands more people, said spokeswoman Caroline Gluck. Another 9,300-capacity camp is opening in the coming weeks, she added. Yet the influx of displaced residents could still strain resources.\n\u201cFinding suitable land to build camps has been our No. 1 challenge, and we raised our concerns about this months ago,\u201d she said. \u201cFor the moment, we have enough capacity.

A senior Iraqi officer said Islamic State staged its attack on units from the elite Counter Terrorism Service (CTS) when the storm and strong winds hampered air surveillance and on-the-ground visibility. He said some militant fighters hid among displaced families to get close to the U.S.-trained troops. Iraqi forces captured the eastern side of Mosul in January after 100 days of fighting and launched their attack on the districts that lie west of the Tigris river on Feb. 19. Defeating Islamic State in Mosul would crush the Iraqi wing of the caliphate declared by the group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, in 2014, from Mosul's grand old Nuri mosque. Residents reported that civilians were killed in an air strike on an Islamic State-run mosque on Wednesday, highlighting the perilous situation facing hundreds of thousands of Mosul residents as the allied forces step up their campaign. The residents said the blast collapsed or damaged a number of neighboring houses, many of which are badly made and poorly maintained. A spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition said he was not aware of an air strike on the Omar al-Aswad mosque. The mosque was where Islamic State sent members of the Iraqi national police and armed forces to surrender their weapons and register in a militant database when the group seized control of the city in 2014. In return they received a pass to prevent their arrest and possible execution at militant check points (para. 1-9). Kalin, S. (2017). Iraqi forces in Mosul fight Islamic State counter-attack.

Donald Trump has made defeating Islamic State one of the key goals of his presidency, and his new administration received a draft Pentagon plan on Monday to accelerate the campaign. Raqqa in Syria, one of Islamic State's two de facto capitals along with Mosul in Iraq, is expected to be the scene of the final battle to crush the jihadists' self-proclaimed Caliphate sometime this year, after a U.S.-backed Iraqi government assault on Mosul already under way since October (para. 1-3).

If they defeat Islamic State in Mosul that would crush the Iraq wing of the caliphate its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared in 2014 over parts of Iraq and neighboring Syria. FOREIGN FIGHTERS BATTLE TO THE END The Iraqi soldiers climbed through a hole in the wall of a garden strewn with ripe oranges and shattered glass, and emerged to find an Islamic State fighter lying flat on his back where he had been killed by Iraqi forces. Lt. Colonel Abdel Amir al-Mohammadawi went through the dead man's pockets after making sure he was not wearing a suicide belt, and pulled out a small address book containing telephone numbers of other fighters, and a contact for \"Islamic Police\". \"He's not Iraqi. He's probably not an Arab,\" said Mohammadawi, judging the man by his appearance and imperfect spelling. \"The closer we get to the center, the more we come up against the foreigners\".   Unlike Iraqi militants who can blend in with civilians and possibly slip through the net of security forces, foreign fighters have no escape and will therefore fight to the end. Mohammadawi said: \"They don't flee like the locals\". There are noticeably more foreign militants in the western half of the city than the east, which Iraqi forces cleared one month ago after 100 days of fighting, Mohammadawi added. \n\nAfter losing the east, Islamic State militants prepared for battle in the west, knocking holes through the walls and expelling residents whose homes offered a vantage from which to fire at advancing Iraqi forces.   At one point, the passage led into an empty hall where a motorcycle was parked. Evidently it had been used by the militants because there was a prayer mat in the plastic crate attached to the back, the soldiers said (para. 6-14). Coles, I.

About 1,000 civilians walked across the front-lines, the largest movement since the new offensive launched last week to deal the ultra-hard-line Sunni Muslim group a decisive blow. In the capital Baghdad, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel Al-Jubeir met Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi in the first such visit in more than a decade between Sunni Muslim-ruled Saudi Arabia and Shi'ite-led Iraq. The new push in Mosul comes after government forces finished clearing Islamic State from the east of the city last month, confining the insurgents to the western sector across the Tigris river. Commanders expect the battle there to be more difficult, in part because tanks and armored vehicles cannot pass through the narrow alleyways that crisscross ancient districts. But Iraqi forces have so far made quick advances on multiple fronts, capturing the northern city's airport on Thursday, which they plan to use as a support zone, and breaching a three-meter high berm and trench set up by Islamic State. The advancing forces are less than three kilometers (two miles) from the mosque where Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared a caliphate spanning Iraq and Syria in 2014, sparking an international military campaign to defeat the group. Losing Mosul would likely deal a hammer blow to the militants' dream of statehood, but they still control territory in Syria and patches of northern and western Iraq from where they could fight a guerrilla-style insurgency in Iraq, and plot attacks on the West (para. 1-8).

They edge towards the city limits, using artillery and airstrikes to soften up the terror group's defenses. ISIS retaliates with suicide bombs, exploits its tunnel networks and activates sleeper cells elsewhere in the city. A long battle of attrition is underway, with some 750,000 civilians caught in the middle. For the Iraqi army and government, the prize is clearing ISIS from the last city it holds in Iraq.\nWhat does the battle look like? The battle for western Mosul is likely to be tougher than that for the eastern half of the city, which took well over two months. Satellite imagery and witness accounts indicate that ISIS' defenses are thicker here, and the warren of alleys in the old city is impenetrable to armored vehicles. On the upside, Iraqi special forces gained hard-won experience in the east. One sergeant in the Counter Terrorism Force told CNN last month that his unit had stopped using vehicles and had pushed forward at night on foot, frequently surprising ISIS fighters. In the initial stage of this latest offensive, the Iraqi Federal Police and the 9th Armored Division have begun shelling areas around Mosul's airport, to the south of the city, ahead of a ground advance. ISIS has heavily fortified this area with road blocks and berms, and long ago rendered the airport runway unusable with trenches. Iraqi military officials said Tuesday that the first target, a hill to the south which overlooks the airport, had been taken. In support, US airstrikes have targeted ISIS operations inside the city, most notably with a bombardment of its command headquarters in the five-story Bab Sinjar building on February 17. The coalition reported heavy airstrikes Monday against ISIS command centers and more than a dozen of its mortar units.\nThere is one major difference to this phase of the battle.

The attack, which came on the third day of a large-scale government offensive to take back west Mosul, marks one of the few instances the militants have used this type of ordnance, which is banned under the 2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions.  Cluster bombs struck an operational headquarters for Iraqi troops in the village of Areyj, near Mosul. A number of U.S. soldiers with the coalition are also bunker-ed there in a separate area of the compound. Damien Spleeters, the head of Iraq operations for Conflict Armament Research, a group which identifies and tracks weapons used in armed conflicts, said the use of cluster munitions by Islamic State is \u201ca very, very rare occurrence.\u201d Similar bombs were used by the extremist group in the Syrian border town of Kobani in 2014, he said. \u201cThis is only the second or third time I see it used by ISIS,\u201d Spleeters said in an interview.
