Much of the construction was very shoddy work and is already crumbling; this is evidence of massive corruption in the government & construction sectors.  Imported/foreign labor was employed in these construction projects, leaving the Angolan workforce unemployed and inexperienced.  In the last year, there has been a significant depression due to low oil prices.  All of this means that the ordinary Angolan may have grown displeased with MPLA.   However, MPLA holds 175 out of 220 seats:  to lose its majority it would have to have a disastrous election result and lose more than 1/3rd of them.  I have read nothing that leads me to think that MPLA would suffer such  a disastrous loss. I suspect that the unpredictability that Reuters referred to is to how many seats each party will win, not which party will win the majority.

Chancellor Angela Merkel looks like a sure bet to win a fourth term as the head of Europe\u2019s biggest economic power when the country votes in late September.

In a 40-minute speech to supporters in the city of Dortmund on Saturday that opened six weeks of campaigning, she didn\u2019t even mention her opponent by name. But behind the confident Ms. Merkel and the struggling Mr. Schulz are four smaller parties in a mad dash for the bronze\u2014a race likely to determine the makeup of the next government and Germany\u2019s political direction for the next four years. Ms. Merkel is almost certain to need a coalition partner to govern. Only once since World War II has a single party won an outright majority. Ms. Merkel\u2019s current government is a \u201cgrand coalition\u201d bringing together Germany\u2019s two main political blocs\u2014her conservatives and Mr. Schulz\u2019s Social Democrats. His party disdains governing in Ms. Merkel\u2019s shadow, and conservatives also say that such a broad coalition should be the exception rather than the rule in German democracy (para. 1-5).

Overall, it seems as if dos Santos has carefully planned his retirement and the takeover of his top position. Free and fair elections in Angola?\nFor assessing the overall quality of democracy in a country, I often rely on the 'Bertelsmann Transformation Index', particularly the Country Reports. They are a great source. The composers are political scientists and country experts. See here for BTI: https://www.bti-project.org/en/home/; the Country Report can be found here: https://www.bti-project.org/fileadmin/files/BTI/Downloads/Reports/2016/pdf/BTI_2016_Angola.pdf. With regard to the indicator \"free and fair elections\" Angola only scored 3 out of 10. So, it is quite clear that the ruling party normally does interfere in the elections process to its favor. One should also take into account the media and the indicator \"freedom of expression\": 4 out of 10. Therefore, elections seem to be based on ethnic, not on national matters. That is no good precondition for building a majority against MPLA. See also the indicator \"association / assembly rights\": 3 out of 10\u2026 Angola lacks fundamental preconditions for a fair electoral competition. Angola is on position 102 of 129 at the 'Status Index' which measures the quality of liberal democracy. Is there potential for revolution?\nThere is. The question is how much. Usually the upheaval for revolutions does not (!) begin at the elections. Usually upheaval begins after elections when citizens realize that there must have been fraud. I think the regime around the MPLA seems quite strong, so it is fairly likely that they will try to influence the political and electoral process in order to get a majority for MPLA. Does an opposition exist?\nYes. \n* Most importantly UNITA. Leader: Isa\u00edas Samakuva. They are quite institutionalized since they emerged in the 60s, fought in the independence war and a civil war against (!) the regime in 1975-2002 - which was a Cold War proxy war with UNITA as the US ally.\nHowever, they have no strong democratic identity (the party was Maoist, later Socialist but non-communist\u2026). The power base is ethnic: it is the Ovimbundu\u00a0ethnic group from the south of the country (6 million out of 25 million living in Angola). Given this history and identity it seems unlikely that they can address a majority.\n* There are some other minor parties with ethnic power bases.\n* May be the most interesting party is National Liberation Front of Angola. But it is very small, right now. And it seems fairly unlikely to say that they will dispute the MPLA majority in parliament. Finally: There is not much time for an evolution of an MPLA alternative. - And as mentioned: structural preconditions for a fair political competition are lacking. All in all, I start with 95 percent majority for MPLA and 5 percent for plurality. Not a plurality: I consider this option to be less likely than 1 percent. Revolutions do not end start at the ballot, they may start with fraud, however.
