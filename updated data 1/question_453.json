Beyond those attacks, I believe too many world actors are in play inside the state to allow a large scale genocide.

The army has been carrying out extensive operations against terrorist bases, mostly in the border areas near Afghanistan but now also in urban areas, which has had a considerable impact.

Another 20 were killed in Parachinar in an attack on a mosque on 31 March 2017. Up to 26 March, 153 civilians fatalities were reported due to terrorism in the website referenced above. Counting the 31 March attack, the total for the first quarter will probably be around 180, which if extrapolated suggests a total of about 700 for the next twelve months. The total civilian fatalities in the first quarter of 2016 were 208, compared to 612 for the whole year, which also indicates that a total of 1000 this year is not too likely.
