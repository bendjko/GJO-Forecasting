I mean, we don't want to make an announcement\" Robin: \"I didn't expect to talk about this ...

In a sense nothing new - we've known this has been a goal for Tesla. Perhaps the only new piece of information is as a confirmation that they are getting closer. Clearly, Tesla is refraining from making official announcement (a confirmation to its shareholders) that it is indeed doing this. It may seem like I am belaboring this, and fixating on unimportant distinctions. But when you are a public company with a fiduciary responsibility to shareholders and regulated by the SEC with regard to anything that you do that might influence your stock price, then you are very careful about what you communicate to the outside world and the meaning of \"announcement\" takes a new level of gravity. The reason I have 20% yes is to hedge against the possibility that GJO will rule against my interpretation.

In a super condensed explanation; you get a tax holiday when you send your capital over for the first time as a WFOE.  In Tesla's case, this would be all the capital required to secure the permits, build your factory, purchase all your raw materials, set up your distribution network (or set up a dealership network) and meet payroll for all senior management, factory workers and sales force until you are \"self sufficient\".   If you do not send enough and need more capital sent from the parent company, you're taxed at a rate of 25% on that transfer - which can take days/weeks to clear through the Bank of China.   They aren't just sending over money for the plant,  The problem is; Tesla doesn't have that much latitude with it's US capital right now, so it would behoove them to send over a generous amount and save the remainder for extraordinary expenses rather than miss their budget target and lose 25% on a $1B transfer.   In 2016, China based LeEco invested $1.8B in a hybrid auto plant, so figure with inflation and Tesla's Apple'esque passion for the state of the art, assume Tesla will need about $2.2B just for the plant, then maybe another $1.5B for all the other expenses listed above, plus 15% just to be safe, and you're looking at about ~$4.3B in upfront investment....

TSLA -3.28% indicated Wednesday that it plans to make cars and sport-utility vehicles in China in about three years as part of a bet to make the pricey electric vehicles more appealing to local buyers. Chief Executive Elon Musk laid out the timeline Wednesday during a conference call with analysts, saying he doesn\u2019t expect significant investment in a China factory until 2019. The Silicon Valley auto maker has been vague about its efforts to set up a factory in the Middle Kingdom beyond a statement that it was exploring the possibility with the city of Shanghai and aimed to announce its plans by year\u2019s end. The Wall Street Journal reported last month that the car maker had reached an agreement to set up its own manufacturing facility in the city\u2019s free-trade zone. Such an agreement would be a milestone for a U.S. company operating in China, giving Tesla a first-of-its kind arrangement and a way around forming a partnership with a local company. /.../ Even with tariffs that make the least-costly Model S roughly 50% more expensive in China than in the U.S., Tesla\u2019s sales in the country have surged in recent years. The auto maker\u2019s revenue in China rose to more than $1 billion last year, from $319 million in 2015, representing about 15% of total revenue and making the country Tesla\u2019s second-largest market.\" Implications: Tesla aimed to make an announcement by end of 2017. I suppose they didn't do because the negotiations stalled over the Joint Venture disagreement (I emphasize that this is just speculating). Now that is out of the way (see my previous comment: https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/723988), so we could see an announcement of some sort in the not too distant future.  No significant investment expected until 2019. This to some extent separates in time the factory from Tesla's current problems. This time window could allow them to announce the Chinese factory with the hopes that a production ramp up at the Fremont factory will solve their cash flow problems and encourage investors to shell over in 2019 for a China factory. This is all assuming that they would announce the factory so much earlier than the actual investment and construction, which is not unlike Tesla I suppose. Sales of Teslas in China are not to be underestimated as a source of revenue. China's middle class is growing and I think many would enjoy the cachet of driving an American car bursting with modern technology and environmental credentials, especially in zones where internal combustion engines are not allowed due to pollution controls.

Going into the Chinese market alone would mean that Tesla could keep better control of its technology and retain all the profits. Still, that means Tesla would have to foot the entire investment cost as well, instead of sharing it with a local partner. Other automakers have learned to work with their Chinese partners to smooth over potential political and labor issues and invest in new facilities together.\" Takeaways: 1) the chance of a joint venture is visually zero now I think given that Tesla wanted independence all along and now it's got it.  2) the chance that this happens within the question's timeframe is now much higher. The joint venture question seemed to be the main reason the negotiations stalled in February (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2018-02-14/talks-stall-on-tesla-s-plans-to-open-factory-in-china-video) The main uncertainty now is whether it will happen before July 1.  One the pessimistic side, Musk's focus is on the Model 3 production, which Tesla needs to ramp up to stave off cash flow concerns, which earlier this year led to a credit rating downgrade by Moody's (https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/27/moodys-downgrades-tesla-credit-rating-on-model-3-production-delays.html). A poor rating is a problem for Tesla, which, I assume, would need additional financing for the new factory in China. To secure it, Tesla would have to prove it can churn out cars in its Fremont plant first, I would imagine.  Additionally, there are more questions to be resolved and hoops to be jumped before Tesla can make a credible announcement. In November 2017, Musk said the China plans had a \"3 year timeframe\" (see Bloomberg link; whether that means factory up and running in 3 years or not is unclear to me). There is the financing question, but here is also a question as to the tariffs Tesla would to paying. President Jinping had announced earlier an intention to lower auto tariffs (https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/10/gm-tesla-shares-jump-after-chinas-xi-announces-plan-to-lower-car-tariffs.html) but the unresolved trade tensions with the U.S. mean that it's up in the air. However, all it takes to resolve this question is an announcement. Given that the negotiations have been going on for 10 months (Bloomberg link above) and are relatively far along with the NYT saying Tesla \"has already negotiated a site\", it seems quite possible for this to happen relatively soon. Musk might have an incentive to do it sooner rather than later to distract from the Model 3 production problems and make investors excited about the future of the company again. It fits his pattern of grand announcement making.

If China does not have a Tesla factory how much harm to China will occur? I would suggest, not very much. China is not short of car factories. Although Tesla might have a very good image, there are other companies that can make electric cars (and make more and cheaper ones). Obviously China is interested in promoting its own car industry. Without a Chinese factory Tesla cars will continue to cost  25% more and if this causes Chinese consumers to select a cheaper locally made electric car, that would appear to be what the Chinese government would prefer. It might be that Chinese electric car makers could learn from Tesla, but without a Chinese partner that will not happen.

Panasonic is the battery producer and has announce it's willingness to build battery factory in Shanghai or nearby cities to supply Tesla their 18650 battery. If Panasonic have decided to build factory in China. Then it must hint Tesla will do the same. That's strong link. \nTo build a Car and sell it in China. The Chinese government  mandated every company to find a local company to start joint venture with 50-50 share each. The the chance Tesla goes alone is pretty small. -5%\nNow the major unknowns are not whether Tesla worried about IP or technology leaking. BMW had built its most sophisticated plant in Shenyang including the engine production and many other traditional car company do the same. It is also not Tesla doesn't like Chinese auto market which is the largest market so far and growing ferociously especially in electric vehicles. Major cities has put a bidding or lottery policy to limit the total number of gasoline cars and those cars also have been limited to go on roads during certain period of rush ours. But EV car can be bought and used without such limitation. \nThe Chinese government put developing EV car as its national strategy and many local companies have put a lot of effort on the section. Even internet giants have invest many new startups and many of those companies get a lot of inspiration from Tesla. Tencent invest Nio and Alibaba invest Xpeng. Not to mention BYD and many other power competitors already sell EV cars in large quantities. If Tesla fail to  introduce their entry level car to Chinese market on time, it will miss huge opportunity. So I believe Tesla has strong incentive to get this done ASAP.\nBack to Tesla, the execution track record is not good. It faced a lot of problem to launch mass production cars and for Musk, he is too busy with many other \"important\" things so he might not fully involved and push the team to accomplish the target. So I gave -20% for NO. \nThe Chinese government may want to protect local EV companies to succeed hence increase the difficulties for Tesla to build factory in China. But on the other hand, the Shanghai local government is every efficient and willing to remove barrier for global giant companies. Check the recent opened the Starbucks Wonderland in Shanghai, that show tremendous support from local government. With mixed information i'll give another -5% NO. \nSo the overall chance to announce is pretty high within the time frame.
