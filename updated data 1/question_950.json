Looking at what I feel are the two comparable boom/bust cycles for Bitcoin it took about 5-12 months for the price to hit a bottom before recovering. That was June of 2011, peaking about 29.60, then bottoming about 2.2 in November, so about 90% lower about 5 months later. Next was December 2013, peaking about 1,100 then bottoming out about 80% lower about Jan 2014, so about a year later.  We are currently about 5 months from the peak, and have seen about a 60% loss in value. As the previous bottoms were still lower, I am inclined to think that we are overall more likely to see a further price decline in the future. However, this is ameliorated by the fact that the 2014 crash was more moderate than the 2011 crash. This is consistent with the overall lowering of volatility in BTC since its inception. So I would lean slightly toward a lower price bottom, but not too hard. Perhaps about 60% below today's price by June 8, and 40% at or above today's price, with the probabilities clustering near today's price. I think that the market overall is very uncertain as the biggest basic risk to BTC and crypto is based around government regulation, particularly in the West -- OECD countries - but some of the other major economies too. If they move to stifle innovation as it would limit their ability to manage the money supply, that will hurt BTC in the near to mid-term, and I am unsure what would happen in the longer term -- the value of the tech might be so strong that it overcomes entrenched interests like banking and national governments to become adopted anyway in the long-term. Or it may become a default black market currency mostly limited to the developing world, where people are more motivated to defy government restrictions to protect their assets from government corruption/ rampant inflation.

It is hard to come up with reasonable assumptions (e.g. some belief about what % of monetary demand BTC will come to represent in the future and how that should be discounted to the present) that justify its current price level.  2) Regardless of 1), market psychology has been a supportive element for the price. Despite the recent downturn, we have seen price support repeatedly at the 6-7k levels. The bubble might not be ready to burst just yet. We are seeing sentiment improve in the market. There are fewer news stories about regulatory backlash. The problems around Tether have quieted down. Finally, the fact that the price has stabilized should diffuse the amount of fear doubt and uncertainty in the market (circular logic here, but that is the nature of markets to some degree isn't it) 3) the price is likely to receive substantial support around the 9k level. There is currently a convergence in that vicinity of the 50, 100 and 200 day moving averages. This is in addition to the support we have already seen at the 6-7k levels, which should limit the downside.  4) There have been some positive stories lately about Goldman Sachs and ICE wanting to open trading, which signals institutional buy-in and potential demand (ICE trading in particular might involve physical ownership of BTC).
