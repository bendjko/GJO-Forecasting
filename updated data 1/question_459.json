More than a hundred residents of Marawi, on the southern island of Mindanao, have died and 70,000 have fled the town of 200,000 since fighters from the Maute Islamist militant group entered the city and clashed with military and police. \"Precision airstrikes are (being) judiciously used to prevent collateral damage and employed at specific targets of resistance to protect our troops and hasten clearing of the city of terrorist elements who continue to resist,\" military spokesman Brigadier General Restituto Padilla said Tuesday, according to the official Philippine News Agency. The siege on Marawi unfolded as Muslims worldwide began to mark the holy month of Ramadan. Mindanao has a significant Muslim population, though the Philippines is a predominantly Catholic country (para. 1-4). Fighting ongoing Reports suggested the Maute fighters were defending Isnilon Hapilon, a longstanding terrorist leader designated by ISIS as the group's emir for Southeast Asia, after he was cornered by Philippines police and military forces (para. 8).\nFilipino soldiers engage in a firefight with ISIS-linked militants on May 30, 2017, in Marawi in the southern Philippines.\nMilitants' ongoing resistance suggested Hapilon, who has a $5 million FBI bounty on his head, was still in the city, the Philippines military said.\nMore than 80 militants had been killed since fighting began, while 17 soldiers and three police officers had died, Armed Forces of the Philippines spokesman Joar Herrara told CNN.\nPhilippines President Rodrigo Duterte suggested over the weekend that he would be open to tapping nationalist rebel groups, which recently signed peace deals with the government, as reinforcements in the fight against ISIS (para. 8-12).

A Philippines intelligence source said that of the 400-500 marauding fighters who overran Marawi City on the island of Mindanao last Tuesday, as many as 40 had recently come from overseas, including from countries in the Middle East. The source said they included Indonesians, Malaysians, at least one Pakistani, a Saudi, a Chechen, a Yemeni, an Indian, a Moroccan and one man with a Turkish passport. \"IS is shrinking in Iraq and Syria, and decentralizing in parts of Asia and the Middle East,\" said Rohan Gunaratna, a security expert at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. \"One of the areas where it is expanding is Southeast Asia and the Philippines is the center of gravity.\" Mindanao has been roiled for decades by bandits, local insurgencies and separatist movements. But officials have long warned that the poverty, lawlessness and porous borders of Mindanao's predominantly Muslim areas mean it could become a base for radicals from Southeast Asia and beyond, especially as Islamic State fighters are driven out of Iraq and Syria. Although Islamic State and groups affiliated to the movement have claimed several attacks across Southeast Asia in the last two years, the battle in Marawi City was the first long drawn-out confrontation with security forces. On Tuesday, a week after the fighting began, the government said it was close to retaking the city. Last year, Southeast Asian militants fighting for Islamic State in Syria released a video urging their countrymen to join the cause in the southern Philippines or launch attacks at home rather than attempting to travel to Syria. Jakarta-based terrorism expert Sidney Jones passed to Reuters some recent messages in a chat-room of the Telegram app used by Islamic State supporters (para. 1-10). Allard, T. (2017).

In a video apparently taken under duress by militants, Father Teresito Suganob said his captors wanted the military to withdraw its forces from Marawi, where Islamic militants still hold pockets of territory after a week of gun-battles with the army. A colleague of Suganob confirmed to The Associated Press that the man in the video is the priest. It was not clear when the video was taken or who released it online, and whether Suganob believed what he was saying or was forced to say it. \"We want to live another day, we want to live another month,\" Suganob said, standing in front of debris and partially burned buildings. Directing his remarks to Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, he said, \"We want to live few years and in your generosity, Mr. President, in your heart, we know you can make something (happen)\" (para. 1-4).

The order creates an Inter-agency Committee on Anti-illegal Drugs (ICAD), that encompasses bodies from police, military and coastguard to health, education and social welfare, and aims to rehabilitate users and suppress dealers large and small. More than 8,000 people have been killed since the drugs crackdown started eight months ago, 2,555 of them in what police say were shootouts during raids. They say 48,000 drugs suspects were arrested. Police deny involvement in the other killings and reject allegations by human rights groups that many of them, mostly unsolved and in mysterious circumstances, were assassinations of drug users with police complicity. The United Nations and much of the West is alarmed by the death toll and Duterte's repeated threats to kill thousands of dealers, and by his refusal to acknowledge that human rights abuses have taken place. Duterte's order published on Friday outlines a \"priority thrust\" of the government to suppress drugs and \"put behind bars\" makers, dealers and traffickers of narcotics while \"transforming users into productive members of society\". It was signed on March 6, the same day the Philippine National Police (PNP) resumed operations following a suspension of the entire force from the drugs war, due to the kidnap and murder of a South Korean by rogue anti-drugs officers. PNP chief Ronald dela Rosa on Monday called for the revived police operations to be \"less bloody, if not bloodless\" (para. 1-8). Mogato, M. (2017).

Although the question info says \"the accidental killing of civilians\" will not be considered a campaign to systematically kill civilians, it appears that the 'war\" against drug dealers is encompassing drug users as well, along with their family members and bystanders. In the first six months of the Duterte Presidency there were more than six thousand killings, and an environment has been created that encourages the police to carry out indiscriminate killings. The two reports below are from the end of 2016, but I suspect the police haven't yet \"finished off\" all their targets yet and at least another 1000 could die in 2017. \"The police also acknowledged that 4,049 suspected drug personalities were victims of vigilante-style killings. This is the most controversial feature of the anti-drug campaign, which is described by human rights groups as a clear case of unabated extrajudicial killings involving state forces. The police, however, blamed the surge of violence on the purging activities of rival drug cartels.\" http://thediplomat.com/2017/01/dutertes-war-on-drugs-in-the-philippines-by-the-numbers/ Duterte's attitude is clear from his interview quoted below\n\"Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said that the killing of innocent people in the country's war on drugs is neither a crime, negligence nor recklessness. Instead, it's collateral damage. \u201cLet me tell you. This is the law of my land. Here is a police. Here is a gangster,\u201d Duterte said as he raised two index fingers to demonstrate why he thinks that is the case during a recent interview with Al Jazeera.\nIn Duterte's scenario, the police officer has an M16 rifle that can shoot multiple rounds, while the gangster is armed with only a pistol. When they exchange fire during a confrontation, the police officer fires his weapon and ends up killing 1,000 other people. \u201cThat's not criminal liability,\u201d Duterte said. \u201cIt could not be negligence because you have to save your life. It could not be recklessness because you have to defend yourself.\u201d\nIn the interview with Al Jazeera, Duterte was asked whether he thinks he has created a state of lawlessness that allowed people to kill to settle old scores under the guise of the war on drugs. Duterte defended his methods, saying his goal is to eradicate his country's massive drug problems \u201cto preserve the interest of the next generation.\u201d \u201cIf you destroy my country, I'll kill you. That's a legitimate thing,\u201d Duterte said.\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/10/18/duterte-has-a-name-for-innocent-people-killed-in-the-philippines-drug-war-collateral-damage/?utm_term=.f31d697854ed"], [1034, "2017-04-03T05:04:10Z", [0.0], ""], [1092, "2017-04-02T19:36:28Z", [0.05], ""], [32300, "2017-04-02T18:43:44Z", [0.0], ""], [32521, "2017-04-02T18:41:12Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-04-02T17:32:48Z", [0.01], ""], [33773, "2017-04-02T15:24:44Z", [0.75], ""], [919, "2017-04-02T15:19:13Z", [0.05], ""], [28414, "2017-04-02T14:42:48Z", [0.0], ""], [29054, "2017-04-02T14:40:15Z", [0.0], "Filipinos continue to have serious problems in many fronts, the radical Moros and the drug trade are tangled, for this event to be a yes the threshold in Philippines is too high. \nThe government forces will act fast and most likely do what they have done in the past; that is, cover it up.\nI think, today the Philippine arm forces and National Police with all his problems, it has improve substantially and it is more professional.
