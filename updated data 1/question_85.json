Abdullah Khan, who is already the fifth NUG candidate for the top defence job, had already been picked once before (he was third in this line at the time) but was never officially introduced to parliament.

The fact that he has yet to be rejected might make him acceptable to the parliamentarians who, over the past years, have blocked many attempts, mainly by Ghani\u2019s predecessor Hamed Karzai, to re-introduce candidates already voted down. The filling of these two positions has been a recurring demand of both houses of parliament (see this AAN analysis) (both led by politicians who are close to the new quasi-opposition), but also of donor countries. Ghani is expected to attend the 2016 NATO summit in Warsaw in early July 2016, and it would cost him a degree of credibility in those circles (who, off the record, are all but uncritical about the NUG\u2019s poor performance so far) if he, in spite of repeated promises, were to show up with those two positions still vacant. The other key positions, which were vacant for a long time, that of interior minister and attorney general, were filled in April 2016.\nLieutenant General Abdullah Khan, whose penultimate position was chief of personnel in the ANA\u2019s general staff, comes across as a good choice to succeed Stanakzai at the MoD. According to officials both in the National Security Council and the Resolute Support Mission, he enjoys a reputation of professionalism, attaining high marks in his military training (including in the Soviet Union), and clean hands.\nhttps://www.afghanistan-analysts.org/old-names-for-the-nds-and-defence-ministry-nug-proposes-stanakzai-and-abdullah-khan-again/\n===============\nCOMMENT:\nGhani is shifting the defense Minister (Acting, a loyalist to Ghani) and appoints Abdullah Khan as a Defense Minister.

Jan 18: \"Afghan Panel Sets Election Date, Drawing Government Criticism\" --> http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/19/world/asia/afghan-panel-sets-election-date-drawing-government-criticism.html The Afghan election commission said Monday that it had set an Oct. 15 date for long-delayed parliamentary and district council elections. But the announcement immediately raised fears of new political deadlock after the country\u2019s power-sharing government denounced the plan as illegitimate. In announcing the date, Ahmad Yousuf Nuristani, the chief of Afghanistan\u2019s Independent Election Commission, evidently did not coordinate with the government. And a spokesman for Abdullah Abdullah, the government\u2019s chief executive, criticized the scheduling because the electoral reform he had demanded had not gone through. \u201cThe current election commission has no legitimacy because it was their weak management of the previous election that brought us on the brink of chaos,\u201d said Javid Faisal, a spokesman for Mr. Abdullah. \u201cReforming the election process is a precondition to any election, and a part of the larger reform is the changing of current commission officials.\u201d ~~~ COMMENT: More grist for the (resolution in the negative) mill. ~~~ Oh, and a few more excerpts from the NYT article above (man, things sound like they are in D-I-S-A-R-R-A-Y in Afghanistan): The Afghan unity government, brokered by the United States after the bitter election dispute between Mr. Ghani and Mr. Abdullah in 2014 threatened to tear the country apart, is in a race against time to meet the requirements of the political agreement it was founded on, set to expire in October. That agreement requires the government to hold local elections, which are already months overdue, by the time it completes two years in office in October. It is also supposed to have convened a grand assembly of elders from across the country by October to amend the Constitution and create the position of prime minister for Mr. Abdullah to move into. Pressure from political opposition groups has been increasing on Mr. Ghani and Mr. Abdullah in recent months. Some of the groups have warned that the government, severely pressed by Taliban offensives across the country, will lose its legitimacy if it does not hold the elections soon. Other groups have given up on the current government entirely, calling for early presidential elections to bring in a new administration. Reforming the electoral process was at the core of the political agreement that brought Mr. Ghani and Mr. Abdullah together. Mr. Abdullah has insisted that this is one area he will not compromise on, and his aides have said the existing election commission needs to go before any vote is held. The entire political process has been frozen by a lack of compromise, with the two leaders\u2019 camps clashing every step of the way and constantly missing deadlines. Mr. Nuristani\u2019s announcement on Monday also left unanswered whether the government and international donors would agree to fund the elections, which are estimated to cost at least $65 million and could be double that amount, according to some international observers. Some analysts also criticized what they characterized as a cynical move by the election commission in picking a date after the political agreement is set to expire, potentially plunging the government into a deeper crisis.\n"], [368, "2016-01-18T21:01:40Z", [0.45], ""], [691, "2016-01-18T15:05:53Z", [0.48], ""], [10039, "2016-01-18T12:21:45Z", [0.34], ""], [1090, "2016-01-18T01:05:01Z", [0.45], ""], [691, "2016-01-17T15:19:18Z", [0.52], ""], [11080, "2016-01-17T06:26:06Z", [0.16], ""], [15676, "2016-01-17T04:34:18Z", [0.05], ""], [368, "2016-01-16T19:41:08Z", [0.05], ""], [691, "2016-01-16T13:12:10Z", [0.54], ""], [136, "2016-01-16T10:49:17Z", [0.4], ""], [368, "2016-01-15T21:23:00Z", [0.05], ""], [368, "2016-01-15T21:21:43Z", [0.85], ""], [691, "2016-01-15T13:05:48Z", [0.54], ""], [15471, "2016-01-15T12:33:02Z", [0.3], ""], [15409, "2016-01-15T02:34:29Z", [0.65], ""], [691, "2016-01-14T21:10:17Z", [0.54], ""], [12874, "2016-01-14T20:27:51Z", [0.39], ""], [15312, "2016-01-14T18:51:21Z", [0.44], ""], [241, "2016-01-14T17:47:41Z", [0.3], ""], [14253, "2016-01-14T17:45:03Z", [0.35], "Put it so high, despite einsteinjs's link from the Washington Post, due to an RT article about increased efforts, or at least dialogue, from the USA, China and Pakistan in Afghanistan.  https://www.rt.com/op-edge/328912-afghan-puzzle-us-taliban/"], [14253, "2016-01-14T17:32:46Z", [0.35], ""], [241, "2016-01-14T03:10:27Z", [0.4], ""], [12302, "2016-01-14T02:51:02Z", [0.63], ""], [691, "2016-01-13T20:54:32Z", [0.56], ""], [368, "2016-01-13T18:53:19Z", [0.85], ""], [10916, "2016-01-13T15:01:15Z", [0.1], ""], [68, "2016-01-13T12:53:10Z", [0.55], "Although there appears to be no recent information on this topic, I'm still optimistic that dysfunction will be overcome to the extent that a new Defense Minister will be confirmed within the next six months.

The NUG comes from a power-sharing agreement between Ashraf Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah, after 2014 presidential elections failed to render a decisive victor. At present, the NUG is riven with pro-Ghani and pro-Abdullah factions. It is so paralyzed by indecision that it\u2019s unable even to fill long-vacant Ministry of Defense and Interior positions. Bureaucracies don\u2019t trust one another. The NUG has no long-term counterinsurgency strategy.

And so the honeymoon with the NUG is definitely over. Afghans have grown tired of its apparent inability to provide basic services or tamp down violence. In November, the NUG was faced with its stiffest challenge to date: nearly 20,000 demonstrators, the largest protest in Kabul since 2001, marched to protest its fecklessness after ISIS beheaded seven Afghans in Zabul province.

The intensity of the battle there has drawn American Special Forces back to the fight despite their transition last year from combat role to a training and advising mission. Reeling under a tremendous Taliban offensive over the past couple of months, the security forces in Helmand have reportedly suffered heavy casualties as the insurgents reach the gates of Lashkar Gah, the provincial capital. On Sunday, the district of Sangin, one of the deadliest places for British and United States forces during the long war, fell back into the hands of the Taliban, according to a district council member, Hajji Mohammed Tahir. Frustrated with a lack of attention from the central government, Helmand\u2019s deputy governor took to Facebook on Saturday to write an open letter to Mr. Ghani. Claiming the president was being fed wrong information about the situation in the province, he said that over two days the forces had suffered about 90 casualties in two districts alone, and that such setbacks were a regular occurrence. \u201cI know that when you read this, you will get out of control and get very angry at me,\u201d wrote the deputy governor, Mohammad Jan Rasoolyar. \u201cBut I have no other way \u2014 that is why I have turned to social media.\u201d http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/21/world/asia/afghan-government-faces-new-set-of-rivals.html?emc=edit_ee_20151221&nl=todaysheadlines-europe&nlid=70183565"], [24, "2015-12-27T17:00:14Z", [0.35], ""], [691, "2015-12-27T14:21:49Z", [0.64], ""], [368, "2015-12-26T21:08:56Z", [0.55], ""], [691, "2015-12-26T15:23:12Z", [0.64], ""], [13853, "2015-12-26T15:03:22Z", [0.85], "Someone on the ground has to be named to mediate between afghan government and the western troops helping them kick Taliban butt"], [13377, "2015-12-26T12:41:44Z", [0.46], "https://larswericson.wordpress.com/2015/12/23/early-christmas-gift-accidental-clustering/"], [12118, "2015-12-25T19:53:30Z", [0.39], ""], [691, "2015-12-25T13:29:14Z", [0.65], ""], [691, "2015-12-24T18:51:25Z", [0.65], ""], [13942, "2015-12-24T08:12:21Z", [0.25], ""], [5001, "2015-12-24T04:52:04Z", [0.7], "Updating for passage of time"], [102, "2015-12-23T22:40:37Z", [0.46], "https://larswericson.wordpress.com/2015/12/23/early-christmas-gift-accidental-clustering/"], [368, "2015-12-23T22:01:46Z", [0.75], ""], [691, "2015-12-23T13:55:10Z", [0.66], ""], [2965, "2015-12-23T13:51:11Z", [0.35], "sheer passage of time of deadlock between  Abdullah and Ghani, they need NATO to stay.

Dec 21, NYT: \"Afghan Government Faces New Set of Rivals\" --> http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/21/world/asia/afghan-government-faces-new-set-of-rivals.html A political opposition of sorts to the Afghan government announced its presence last week, with warnings that President Ashraf Ghani\u2019s struggling administration would lose its legitimacy if it failed to hold long-delayed local elections within the next nine months. But one sense of relief for the Afghan president and his coalition partner, Abdullah Abdullah, came from the fact that the opposition, called the Council of Protection and Stability, already mirrors their struggling administration in its disunity. Several prominent members of the council, all former cabinet ministers in the government of Hamid Karzai, walked out of the inauguration of the new alliance, saying that the demands were too soft. The current government had exhausted its opportunities for change, they said, and the opposition should call for an immediate meeting of tribal elders from across the country to discuss alternatives, including an interim government that would hold an early presidential election.\n[...]\nAnalysts see the formation of the council as both an effort to pressure a struggling government to deliver on its promises and an attempt to press for greater inclusion in power. \u201cThey are after appeasements. They just want to announce their presence because they want to pressure the government to give them political and military positions,\u201d said Wadir Safi, a lecturer of political science at Kabul University. It was unlikely that the members of the opposition council would have much popular support, because many of them had controversial pasts, Mr. Safi said. But the government\u2019s abysmal record has given many of them hope that they can exercise some power anyway, he added. Mr. Ghani\u2019s government came to power through a power-sharing agreement brokered by Secretary of State John Kerry after an election stalemate last year threatened to throw the country into a civil war. The agreement\u2019s two-year deadline expires next September, and it calls for a thorough overhaul of the election process, the holding of parliamentary and district elections, and a national assembly of elders to amend the Constitution and formalize Mr. Abdullah\u2019s position as a prime minister. But 15 months after coming to power, the government has struggled with even the most basic steps needed for holding the elections, including an agreement on the makeup of the commission to oversee the vote. A harsh winter, and a Taliban offensive that is expected to intensify in the spring, makes their task of holding the elections as scheduled even more difficult.\n[...]\nA senior official close to Mr. Ghani said the government was determined to hold the elections before the deadline. But, in the meantime, he said, it will also try to offer job opportunities to stem the youth exodus and improve local governance over the next several months. He said that if the security situation delayed the voting, the government\u2019s fragility would be compensated for in the public perception at least. \u201cThe will and determination is there on part of the leaders to hold the elections at the loya jirga on time, but they keep getting sidetracked because of crisis after crisis,\u201d said the official, who asked for anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the news media.\n~~~~ COMMENT: OK, so there's lots in there, but I think two big things for this IFP. 1) Afghanistan is supposed to hold an election before September 2016.\n2) The current government has had issues getting things together to hold the election. We could probably even include the \"senior official's\" quote about Ghani's determination to hold elections before the deadline. It's just one sentence, but in having it phrased like that, it leads me to believe that there is ZERO percent chance that there will be an election before the end of this IFP. The only reason I'm leaving this at 1% (for now) is because Afghanistan is in flux and at the risk of sounding trite, there's always a chance for a black swan. The foreseeable (?) black swan would be a confluence of events that has Afghanistan's Parliament sit before the next election (and then a MoDef is confirmed). I still think that's extremely unlikely, though. ~~ For more on Afghanistan's troubles on funding its election, see two of my earlier forecasts on this IFP: Nov 24 -- 4% --> https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/48636\nDec 6 -- 3% -->https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/57423"], [102, "2015-12-21T04:26:21Z", [0.45], ""], [43, "2015-12-21T04:12:21Z", [0.15], "Persuaded by @GeneH plus a torrent of news from Afghanistan leading me to wonder whether what passes for a central government today may be entirely gone by the forecast horizon.

The Taliban have taken control of four districts in Helmand and now threaten border areas of Lashkar Gah, the provincial capital. Preventing the provincial capital from falling into the hands of the Taliban is a priority for U.S. Army Gen.

The overall security situation in Afghanistan deteriorated in the second half of 2015, according to a report released by the Pentagon on Tuesday (Guardian, NPR, TOLO News). The report, mandated to be made on a semi-annual basis to Congress, noted an increase in insurgent attacks and in casualties. The report reads in part: \u201cThe Taliban have remained active in their traditional strongholds, namely in Helmand in the south and Logar and Wardak in the east, and also created a sense of instability for brief periods of time in other parts of the country, such as in Kunduz in northern Afghanistan.\u201d The report covers the time period in which President Obama halted plans to withdraw American troops from Afghanistan.

John Campbell, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, stated that ISIS is attempting to develop a regional base in Jalalabad (Pajhwok, TOLO News). Gen.

After the last Presidential elections, the Abdullah group alleged fraud and refused to accept defeat, even after an internationally supervised \"audit\" of the votes. The present forced compromise with Abdullah as Chief Executive and Ghani as President papered over their differences, but it keeps showing up in cases like this, as Parliament is also divided. Whenever the Abdullah group feels its preferences have been ignored, it will attempt to use Parliament to block implementation, while the US has stopped trying to bang heads together. Unless there is a major external threat that unites the two groups ( e.g. Taliban successes in the field next spring), a change in the status quo seems unlikely. The mistrust between the groups is so great that the next elections are unlikely until all pre-election issues, starting from re-verification of the voters lists, are agreed and done (I remember from last year that the number of voters' cards issued exceeded the number of registered voters by over 50%)."], [4729, "2015-11-25T05:16:10Z", [0.0], ""], [10745, "2015-11-25T02:30:45Z", [0.0], ""], [60, "2015-11-24T21:28:22Z", [0.04], "The biggest and maybe most important data point here is that the Afghan Parliament is... in flux. There was supposed to be an election this year (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_parliamentary_election,_2015 ), but it looks like that might not happen until next year. Despite the need for elections, there is still a Parliament (http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/20/world/asia/afghan-parliaments-term-is-extended-after-squabbles-delay-elections.html ), but there's some question as to the legitmacy. If we take a step back, Pres. Ghani has tried to confirm three (!) Defence Ministers. The last one (and current Acting) didn't go well (http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/23/world/asia/taliban-attack-afghan-parliament-and-seize-a-2nd-district-in-north.html ) as the Taliban bombed Parliament during what would have been the confirmation. Right now, the guy that the Pres. was trying to have confirmed is the acting DM (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Masoom_Stanekzai ). Again, he's the ACTING DM. List of Afghani DMs -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Afghanistan) \\\\ So, it seems unlikely that there'll be a \"sitting of Parliament\" to confirm the current Acting DM. Meaning, this question is, essentially, a proxy for whether we think that there will be Afghani elections before the Summer of 2016 (giving them time to pick and then confirm a Cabinet. I found this Q&A (http://asiafoundation.org/in-asia/2015/11/18/looking-ahead-in-afghanistan-a-conversation-with-political-economist-timor-sharan/ ) helpful in understanding the situation in Afghanistan as it relates to electoral reform. Excerpt: You said that one of the major issues of the 2014 election was that there was no Afghan-led election dispute resolution mechanism in place. Ahead of possible parliamentary elections next year, how important is it that such a mechanism is in place, and what role could it play in ensuring legitimacy? The international community has invested heavily in the Afghan elections in the past 14 years. This investment has been significant both financially and politically. However, a major missing element has been an Afghan-led election dispute resolution mechanism, undermining the legitimacy of election results in Afghanistan. Without a credible dispute resolution mechanism in place, the most transparent elections in Afghanistan could theoretically lead to a dispute, with each group/candidate accusing the other of fraud and vote-rigging. Unfortunately, there are not many signs that this will change by the next parliamentary elections, especially as all bodies (i.e., the Election Reform Commission) are partisan and the AGO appointment is still pending. \\\\\\ COMMENT: Note that it says POSSIBLE parliamentary elections. Even the informed folks on this matter don't seem to think that the prospects for elections in 2016 are high."], [689, "2015-11-24T21:13:28Z", [0.0], ""], [102, "2015-11-24T20:55:13Z", [1.0], "This is a dumb question.
