Falih's appointment is only likely to strengthen this strategy rather than lead to any change in thinking, Saudi watchers and analysts say.\" http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-07/saudi-aramco-chairman-al-falih-replaces-al-naimi-as-oil-minister\n\"Al-Falih is known to be close to King Salman and his 30-something son Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the deputy crown prince who has been a growing force driving the country\u2019s policies.

I'm reading the question as Iran formally agrees to a cap before 1 July 2016, but that it may take time for actual production to match the agreed level. According to Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_industry_in_Iran#/media/File:IRAN_oil%26gas_production.jpg), Iranian production was above 4mb/d in the mid-1970s, fell to around 2mb/d in the early 1980s, recovered to just below 4mb/d in the 1990s and 2000s.  In February, Iran\u2019s production was 3.22mb/d, up from 2.87mb/d in August 2015.  It appears that Iran has said publicly (can\u2019t find a direct quote, didn\u2019t look that hard) that they would like to get back to 4mb/d before they agree to any kind of a cap. In the past few weeks, it appeared that an agreement between Saudi Arabia, Russia, and other major producers (but not Iran) was in the works.  On April 18th, it was reported that the talks had collapsed, with Prince Mohammed calling the Saudi oil minister Ali al Naimi and ordering him to kill the talks.  According to the FT: \u201coil, analysts say, has become a weapon for Saudi Arabia to wield in its proxy war with Iran.\u201d A low oil price hurts both Saudi Arabia and Iran.  Saudi Arabia runs a large budget deficit, although the country has many years of reserves and probably can borrow.  Iran does not run a deficit but has no reserves.  Economically, neither will be forced to come to an agreement, particularly not before the 1 July question deadline.   Yet Iran is perhaps no worse off by agreeing to a cap compared to continuing the fight.  With production of 4mb/d at the current price of around $40, that is $160m per day of revenue.  If Iran agrees to a cap at current levels (3.22mb/d) and the price goes up to $50, Iran generates $161m per day of revenue.   Saudi Arabia has made its position known: \u201cno cap without Iran.\u201d  This actually makes it more likely that Iran agrees to cap its production than it was before the Doha meeting, where a production freeze might have been agreed without Iran having to put its own cap in place.  Now, for a production freeze to happen, Iran must also agree to a cap.   We must also make an adjustment for the political pressure that might be brought to bear on Iran.  There were many other parties at the Doha meeting, including other OPEC members and Russia, and they all seemed to favor a production freeze.  Perhaps some of these other actors may be able to pressure Iran into softening their 4mb/d position, placating Saudi Arabia, and agreeing to a cap. Ultimately, it seems to me that the chance Iran agrees to cap is still low, but not zero.  I\u2019m going to put it at 15% (implying 85% chance that Iran does not agree to a cap by 1 July)."], [20309, "2016-04-19T13:58:11Z", [0.01], ""], [20623, "2016-04-19T12:59:08Z", [0.01], ""], [15953, "2016-04-19T12:47:49Z", [0.01], ""], [22690, "2016-04-19T12:31:50Z", [0.07], "As discussed would drop probability if price remained in range, also taking opportunity to reassess my logic.\nStill believe my interpretation of question is correct, ie Iran capping at pre-sanction levels not a high bar, but my assumption, that Iran and Saudi Arabia would see through their enmity for the benefits of their own mutual advantage by surpassing that low bar was off.

Iran had already made it clear it would keep increasing production till it reached pre-sanction levels, not expected before 2017. There is likely to be a crash in oil prices in the coming days, as much of the rise since February has been the result of market sentiment rather than supply/demand. If the fall in prices is severe enough, Saudi Arabia may be persuaded to re-think before the OPEC meeting in June but right now it looks like there won't be an OPEC agreement before 01 July. The only reason I was as high as 45% on this question for a couple of periods was that I expected the other oil producers would announce a freeze without Iran, and Iran would express support by agreeing to join it at a later date. Without an OPEC agreement, Iran won't even feel the need to talk about a freeze. Part of a useful analysis from the Financial Times (which requires registration or payment) is copied below  -  \"Why did Saudi Arabia change tack? This is probably the most important question that needs answering. Although there were mixed messages in the run-up to the meeting, senior Opec delegates were confident Saudi Arabia would back a deal even without the involvement of Iran. The ministry of petroleum and mineral resources, led by Ali al-Naimi, was said to have been involved in the first draft of the agreement that was circulating among delegates in Doha on Sunday.\nBut something led to Saudi Arabia toughening its stance and insisting that all Opec members, including Iran, back the deal.  A clue might be found in comments made by Saudi Arabia\u2019s powerful deputy crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. He told Bloomberg last week that the kingdom would not sign up without Tehran, suggesting he had decided against giving any leeway to a fierce regional rival.\n\u201cThe failure to reach an agreement in Doha is a reminder that Saudi Arabia is in no mood to do Iran any favours right now and that their ongoing geopolitical conflict cannot be discounted as an element of the current Saudi oil policy,\u201d said Jason Bordoff of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University.\nIndeed, this might be the key takeaway from the meeting \u2014 the increasing power and influence of the 30-year-old deputy crown prince on oil policy.\nWhat does this say about Opec policy?\nAlthough this was not an Opec meeting, Sunday\u2019s gathering in Doha still highlights the deep divisions in the production cartel - in particular the enmity between Saudi Arabia, and Iran which is emerging from years of sanctions and wants to win back market share. In the wake of Sunday\u2019s meeting, the organisation is going to struggle to convince the market that it can work collectively to manage supply. That may not matter if, as many analysts and traders believe, the oil market is rebalancing of its own accord as the impact of low prices results in more high-cost production being taken offline.

Earlier, Zangeneh dismissed any freeze agreement that would apply to Iran as \u201cridiculous\u201d because the nation aims to revive production after anti-Tehran sanctions were lifted following the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) between Iran and six world powers on January 16. http://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2016/04/13/1047881/final-deal-on-crude-output-freeze-possible-without-iran-russia-says Adding these facts together, significant & fundamental differences persist.

If they just wanted to know if Iran would cap output, they'd not have inserted the words, \"agree to\", and  the question would (or should) have been stated \"Will Iran cap its oil output before July 1?\"   Therefore, I am ASSUMING that GJI is asking if there will be an agreement prior to July 1, in which case it should have been worded, \"Will Iran agree before 1 July to cap its oil output?\"  If that was the intent of the question, the question as posed contains a grammatical error:  a misplaced modifier.\n~~~~~~~\nFrankly, at this point I don't think either will happen before July 1, especially putting in place an actual cap.

( It is estimated that at approximately$50/b that the US fracking producers can profitably tap the wells previously drilled. So this is probably close to maximum price unless global demand increases.) At this point in the bloodbath of cheap oil, one would think a feasible goal would be to establish a price floor. My view is that any oil production agreement is simply a profit maximization question. Since OPEC  is no longer able to dictate the oil spigot, then the market essentially mirrors a perfectly competitive market with everybody out for themselves.  If I had more guts, I would go higher on this IFP, but time is very short and there is still a lot of political posturing that can get in the way.

I'll re-iterate some form of the following option for a deal: there could be a workaround to allow for export of the stored oil Iran has put aside during the sanctions and to not include this strictly in the caps. Maybe they implement a Iran daily cap of 3 MBD, but allow for additional export of the reserve; or, a lower cap, but allow for reserve oil to be added (everybody has to save face too). neither Iran nor Saudi Arabia will be willing to look like they are taking directives from the other. But as Russia and Saudi Arabia recently recognized (through recent caps) that a full-out price war hurts everyone, so some level of control is mutually beneficial. It would seem Iran would be willing to play in that court.  Some sources indicate that Iran is only capable of producing approx. 1 MBD now and that offloading the oil from storage tankers will be somewhat problematic. In any case, I don't think the Iranians want to damage themselves.
