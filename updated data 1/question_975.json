Do they use newspaper reports? Do alleged atrocities count? In messy situations, an organisation may estimate the number of deaths. Do estimates count or only verified deaths? Which organisations' estimates are valid? Bit of a tricky one.

Genocide for the EWP is defined by Systematically killing of civilians Since the beginning of 2018, there have been more than 1300 people killed in the farmer herder conflict [1]. However, it's hard to tell whether that was organized or not (i'll update if there is more conclusive evidence if this is true later on).  But worrying about the past  really isn't what we are trying to do.  The 1300 killings have displaced hundreds of thousands of people in Nigeria. And there is paramount tension being drawn on ethnic lines. The bottom line is, there have been attacks and there are likely to continue. The best indicator of genocide is people being systematically killed by a group.

Although the Nigerian government indicates that Boko Haram have been neutralized, sources indicate that Boko Haram killed 900 people in 2017, slightly more than they did in 2016 (BBC), and the CFR report that Borno State had 1,940 deaths reported over the same period of time - July 2016 to June 2017 - last year (CFR). Since we do not know the nature of the deaths reported, i.e. whether a result of intentional civilian targeting, I have to assess my probability relatively low, while taking into account the indiscriminate terrorist attacks of Boko Haram that continue in highly civilian congested markets, towns, city centers and even IDP camps (such as in Maiduguri and Durumi IDP camp, July 2017 IDP camp attacks).  Furthermore, BBC's account of 900 deaths in 2017, take into account deaths in Boko Haram territories in Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger and Chad. However, the largest death tolls are reported in Nigeria, and this is taken into account in my probability assessment.  I have taken into account that as Boko Haram continues it's campaign of civilian targeting, the likelihood of state military action increases, and the Nigerian state has a history of indiscriminate civilian killing as well as extrajudicial killing.  https://www.cfr.org/nigeria/nigeria-security-tracker/p29483 https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-42735414 https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/thousands-displaced-boko-haram-languish-abuja-idp-camps-180325070133915.html"], [29980, "2018-07-06T01:50:38Z", [0.99], ""], [46079, "2018-07-03T20:42:40Z", [0.03], ""], [28166, "2018-07-03T12:00:49Z", [0.08], ""], [36147, "2018-07-03T11:02:08Z", [0.03], ""], [59316, "2018-07-03T09:30:51Z", [0.22], ""], [18846, "2018-07-02T17:44:06Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2018-07-02T14:51:29Z", [0.16], ""], [59439, "2018-07-01T13:20:31Z", [0.05], ""], [55873, "2018-06-30T03:48:03Z", [0.25], ""], [691, "2018-06-29T17:38:50Z", [0.18], ""], [5018, "2018-06-29T03:30:46Z", [0.2], ""], [691, "2018-06-29T01:38:15Z", [0.18], ""], [34353, "2018-06-29T00:16:42Z", [0.01], ""], [59586, "2018-06-28T23:45:54Z", [0.0], ""], [59477, "2018-06-28T19:19:26Z", [0.35], ""], [15196, "2018-06-28T17:39:25Z", [0.05], ""], [1333, "2018-06-28T14:08:29Z", [0.05], ""], [32100, "2018-06-28T12:46:23Z", [0.05], ""], [59499, "2018-06-27T22:34:41Z", [0.32], ""], [59487, "2018-06-27T20:29:01Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2018-06-27T19:02:13Z", [0.64], ""], [59293, "2018-06-27T18:34:26Z", [0.85], ""], [59317, "2018-06-27T18:25:36Z", [0.97], ""]], "open_date": "2018-06-27T17:00:15Z", "close_date": "2018-10-01T06:59:15Z"}
