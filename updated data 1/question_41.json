The polls of all but one of those firms put the gap between the Liberals and the Conservatives outside the margin of error. And every poll has the New Democrats in third, trailing the Conservatives by between seven and 12 points and the Liberals by between 12 and 17 points. The CBC Poll Tracker, which will be updated throughout the day Sunday as new polls are published, has awarded the Liberals a lead in the polling average and in the average seat projection since Oct. 7. The Liberals' likely high range of seats has also outpaced the Conservatives' high range for the last week, as Trudeau's party moved ahead in Ontario and subdued the advantage the Tories had in vote efficiency. The gap that exists between the Liberals and Conservatives in the Poll Tracker is not wide enough to give the Liberals a high probability of reaching the 170-seat mark required for a majority government. It is also not wide enough to rule out the possibility the Conservatives could eke out more seats than the Liberals nationwide. \\\\\\\\\\ Comment: It might be a bit of wishful thinking on my part, but it looks like Canada's Parliament is going to go \"Red\" tomorrow.

Only pollsters Angus Reid Institute and Forum Research have showed Conservative leads in the last week and both had the Liberals and Tories bunched within the margin of error. \"For a party and leader that began the election campaign on Aug. 2 firmly in third place \u2014 in public support, in leadership ratings and in incumbent seats in the previous Parliament \u2014 the turnaround is little short of amazing, says pollster Greg Lyle of Innovative Research Group.\n. . . \n\"Lyle says based on his polling the Liberal surge seems likely to result in some seat pick-ups in ridings that were Conservative and NDP \"blow-outs\" in the 2011, defined as margins of victory of more than 25 percentage points. If those ridings start turning red Monday night, look out. \"Pollster Frank Graves of Ekos Research has been doing daily opinion tracking for most of the year and says that for 20 straight days up until a week ago he had the Conservatives in the lead. Since then, the Liberals have pulled ahead.  \"Sure, if those trends continue, (Liberals) can aspire to a majority,\" said Graves. \"Do I think it's the most likely outcome now? No.\" \"Ekos surveys show the public currently sees the potential of a Liberal minority government or a Conservative minority as equally probable. \"But nobody, as yet, is seeing this as a majority,\" for the Liberals, said Graves. \"In fact, it is Conservative supporters who are more likely to see a majority.\" \"Since Confederation, no third-place party in the seat standings has ever vaulted to government in a single election campaign and occasions when a party added 100-plus seats are exceedingly rare. \"Graves says Harper's Conservatives may benefit from better voter turnout and from the efficiency of the Conservative vote. \"He's not out of it yet.\" \"The cautionary note on any perceived polling lead comes from recent past provincial experience. British Columbia was gobsmacked in 2013 when Christy Clark's Liberals won a majority mandate after polls right up to voting day suggested an NDP majority was in the cards. \"Lyle says poll obsessives should be especially wary of seat projection models this time around. There are 30 new ridings in play, the boundaries of other ridings have been redrawn and models depend in part on extrapolating from the unusual 2011 election, in which Liberals had their worst result ever by far and the NDP its best. \"I think the patterns of the last election are history and we're going back to more traditional patterns,\" said Lyle.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  So, the momentum is with the Liberals.

Interestingly, the Conservatives blame a \"disastrous\" campaign by the NDP, led by Thomas Mulcair, as opposed to the  Conservatives inability to sell their ideas. If so, they mistook tactics for strategy. \nA good political strategy by Mr. Trudeau not to ask the NDP to become their partners, then the NDP would have been given more support by their followers, but now that he said it is not possible to discuss it, there is a sense of urgency by the NDP voters to vote out Conservatives in supporting the Liberals and then working for a Liberal coalition agreement after the election.  Surging Canadian Liberals ask for majority mandate in next week's election\nhttp://ca.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKCN0S820820151014 By Randall Palmer HAMILTON, Ontario (Reuters) - Canadian Liberal leader Justin Trudeau, surging in opinion polls in the final stretch of the election campaign, asked voters on Wednesday to give him a majority government on Oct 19 - but insisted he would not get over-confident. \"Am I asking Canadians to vote for us? Yes. Am I asking them to vote for us across the country? Yes. Am I asking them for a majority government? Yes,\" Trudeau said in answer to a reporter's question. Trudeau has rarely talked about the possibility of jumping from the Liberals' third-party status to majority government, mainly because it had seemed to be so far out of reach. But the Liberal Party has broken out from what had been a virtual tie in polls with the governing Conservatives and the left-of-center New Democratic Party (NDP) and is approaching the support levels that have delivered majority governments. The Liberals now lead the Conservatives, who are seeking a fourth straight mandate under Prime Minister Stephen Harper, by between five and seven percentage points, and the NDP by 12 to 15 percentage points in three polls released on Tuesday and Wednesday. The polls - by Nanos, Ekos and Ipsos - have the Liberals winning the support of between 35.6 percent and 37 percent of voters. In the past, majority governments have been formed with support in the high 30s. Trudeau, son of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, prefaced his remarks about asking for a majority government by saying in French: \"I don't have the over-confidence to speak about a political strategy. I know Canadians will make a good decision.\" Privately, pessimistic Conservatives say their prospects have been hit hard by what they call a \"disastrous\" campaign by the NDP, led by Thomas Mulcair. This means the center-left vote is flocking to the Liberals rather than splitting between the two parties as it did in the 2011 election, a factor which helped Harper win a majority.    \"If there is a bright side to this, it's that we can now ignore Mulcair and set the rest of the campaign up as a straight fight between the prime minister and Trudeau - who do you trust the most?\" said one well-placed Conservative. The Conservatives have also tended to do better than polling suggests, in part because of their strong get-out-the-vote organization. Trudeau adviser Gerald Butts urged the Liberal faithful to focus on the last days of the campaign, not the opinion polls. \"Keep working hard. Every minute you read a poll is a minute you're not persuading a Canadian,\" Butts tweeted to Liberal campaign workers.

(2) In Canada, the party with the most seats tends to form government (even if they don't have a majority). While coalition governments are constitutionally possible, the idea has proven divisive in the past. In 2008, for example, an effort by the Liberals, NDP, and Bloc to form a coalition government proved highly controversial and ultimately failed (see the history of coalition governments in Canada linked below).  (3) While Mulcair's NDP is open to working with the liberals, Justin Trudeau has come out against the idea of forming a coalition government with the NDP. As it takes two to tango, this pretty much rules this option out. (4) There is some chance that Justin Trudeau's Liberals will end up capturing more seats than the Conservatives. Currently, only eight seats separate the Liberals and the Conservatives in the latest CBC projections; it is possible that the Liberals will be able to make up this ground in the next two weeks.

Green Party leader Elizabeth May suggested that Labour and the NDP combine after the election to prevent Mr. Harper from forming a government if he wins, but that is not set in stone between them (Palmer & Schnurr, 2015). It is doubtful if  RH Harper wins that he will have enough seats to have a majority and, with a recession, there is no substantial reason why any opposition party would support his economic policy from Labour or the NDP.  The Conservatives are also gaining on the Liberals in Ontario (Ipsos, 2015). So, RH Harper, who now slightly leads in the tracking poll as the favorite among candidates as the better PM, could win the battle but lose the war.  Black swan: The opposition may have more votes, but the question is if they have enough ridings to carry them to challenge RH Mr. Harper for PM but, as of this writing, he does not have enough votes to form a majority government.  If RH Harper believes his minority government is in trouble, if he cannot gather a majority, he could ask the governor general, as RH Harper did in 2004, to suspend Parliament. If so, this would make it his 6th prorogation of Parliament, so there is precedence of him doing so. But that is not necessarily going to prove much with this strategy as it did for him during 2004 when he successfully asked the governor general for prorogation when the NDP called for RH Harper's removal from his PM role, since it was for a vote of confidence.  But, this is a contentious election so it is not unlikely that the parties will act to underhand one another to prevent their left or right opponents from easily gaining dominance after the election.\n\nReferences Ipsos.

Will the polls be erroneous (like they have in other national elections in other countries, recently?) 1b. A second point on that, the polls in Canada have notoriously been \"off\" in the last few elections (provincially, that is). 2. PMSH is one of the longest tenured PM's in Canadian history #6 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Prime_Ministers_of_Canada_by_time_in_office) and so Canadians might be ready for someone new (to that end, of the \"modern\" day PM's, only Pierre Trudeau has won 4 mandates [PMSH is at 3]) 3. There's the sometimes hard-to-predict dynamic with Quebec vs. the rest of the country. To that end, Quebec is the main reason the the NDP served as the Official Opposition for the last 4 years. Also, there was a national debate in French last night and some of the prevailing opinion was that it didn't help Mulcair (the leader of the NDP)'s cause. 4. The exodus from the Conservative Party is noteworthy. That is, many of PMSH's cabinet members have already retired from politics (i.e. now there's a \"short bench\"). Some have been reading this as a sign that PMSH time in power is waning (and the polls would seem to agree that PMSH is almost assuredly not going to win another majority -- unless #1 from this list comes into play). 5. This is the longest election in Canadian history (modern day). PMSH \"called\" the election about 2.5 months in advance, which is unheard of in Canada (usually somewhere between 35 and 45 days). That's certainly had an effect on party's/organization's ability to fundraise/spend (certain Canadian law limit the ability of group's spending during an \"election period,\" which Canada was technically in when the election was called). ~~~ So, certainly lots to consider. I was waiting to jump in on this question because it seems like it really is a toss up, but after watching the training, I realize that waiting to jump in wasn't helping me. At this point, of course, it's going to be one of the three parties asked about in this question. It seems like, at this point, there's at least a little bit of \"tea leaves\" reading in making a prediction.

The numbers go to 66% if he loses majority seats. Among conservatives, the numbers are 27% and 37% respectively. This is higher than the same question asked of Messer's. Trudeau and Mulcair (Ipsos, 2015, September 4)).  Tories continue to lose ground, down to 27%, -2. In Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Alberta, Conservatives lead, but otherwise are well behind. The Liberals have moved ahead of the NDP nationally, but when asked who is the one who makes the better PM, voters selected Muclair 38%, Trudeau 32% and Harper 30%, although more voters thought Trudeau won the debate (Ipsos, 2015, September 4). Whereas Mr. Muclair is believed the candidate most likely to represent Canada as PM, he lost the majority of voters in Ontario -2%, which makes Mr. Trudeau ahead in the province which may decide the next PM (Ipsos, 2015, September 22). The Liberals and NDP are tied as to which party would deal with the budget, and a balanced budget is critically important (74%) to voters (Ipsos, 2015, September 22).  The Liberal memory of balancing a budget may have some relation to when the Liberal PM, RH Paul Martin the younger (the elder Martin was also RH, though he was not a PM), did so as a former exchequer.  As a related note, in the presidential election, Canadians would elect Democrats (55%) in landslide victory over Republicans (17%) and Independent candidates (28%) if they would vote in US elections.  Canadian Conservative Party voters, (say) the Democrats (41%) would defeat the Republicans (36%) and independent candidates (23%) if they could vote (Ipsos, 2015, August 29). This may have some inherent bias based on their own dissatisfaction with the Tories blended with other external factors such as their attitude on US candidates. As a neighboring nation, Canadians have interest in the US candidates as to how he or she may affect Canada\u2019s domestic and foreign policies and, within Canada, these ideas are more intense within their own candidate selection.  Black swan. The Canadians have a hard time telling the difference between the major parties, based on policies or ability to change their perception of them as to why one party stands out over another party (40%). The one party that has some identity between them is the NDP which voters agree made changes to themselves as to how they were organized ten years ago\u2019(Ipsos, 2015, September 5).  Whereas Ontario voters give the Liberals a small advantage over the NDP, in Toronto, the majority (56%) of voters said they did not to lock in their choice (2015, September 5).  Should the NDP\u2019s numbers continue to drop in Quebec (Grenier, 2015), the votes may go to the Liberal party.

His comments today do nothing to contradict that assertion, nor do they preclude working with the NDP if that party was in power in a minority situation. Tom Mulcair, for his part, has suggested he is open to a coalition with the Liberals. However, he said talks about such an arrangement have failed, as Trudeau \"has slammed the door shut conclusively every time we've raised that.\" \"My priority is to get rid of Stephen Harper,\" Mulcair told Mansbridge in another interview. \"Apparently Justin Trudeau's priority is to get rid of me.\""], [1253, "2015-09-23T02:56:44Z", [0.35, 0.33, 0.32, 0.0], "updating"], [691, "2015-09-22T20:22:34Z", [0.65, 0.3, 0.05, 0.0], "Harper has been, shall we say, resilient in the past, but the big Q is who will enter a coalition with the CPC if it comes to that (as it will).

I base this upon a couple assumptions about the polling data and Canadian politics in general. The first assumption is based on the idea that, very generally, conservative parties do worse in the polls because many conservative voters are less vocal and less likely to openly voice their conservatism than others. Thus many polls over-report voters on the left than center-right. This means that a potentially significant chunk of the 9-10% of undecided or non-response voters are conservatives. This was seen in the recent British election, where the Tories swept a majority despite close polls. The other assumption is based on the fact that cities are underrepresented in the Canadian electoral system. Being much more dense, they don't have as many corresponding ridings as their population would represent. The fact is that rural areas generally go more Conservative, giving Harper an edge. I also think the effects of Albertan apathy towards Harper might be exaggerated. While many might not be happy, the other options are with the NDP or Liberals. Though the NDP swept aside the provincial Conservatives, Canada's dis-integrated party system means that the national Conservatives are playing on a different ball field. No doubt the NDP will pick up some seats in the cities but where do you think all those provincial Wildrose votes are going federally?  Finally, I think that the NDP and the Liberals are going to sabotage each other in many ridings, handing some seats to the Conservatives and splitting others between them. Quebec, for example, will be an interesting battleground between the NDP and Liberals as the breakup of the BQ will no doubt bolster Liberals (and Conservatives) in many ridings won by the NDP in 2011. I also predict that the NDP, occupying a farther left position despite Mulcair's moderate face, will do worse than is currently predicted, leading me unable to choose between them and the Liberal for second as of now. However, it's still much too early to tell. Harper's gag orders and refusal to debate are definitely hurting him among important demographics. I also think that the First Nations vote, if it mobilizes, could swing the election against the Conservatives but whether they will do so or remain abstentionists is up in the air. Either way, it's going to be dramatic."], [94, "2015-09-22T16:18:47Z", [0.4, 0.26, 0.34, 0.0], "What Prediction Markets say:\niPredict says NDP 40%, Liberals 30%, Conservatives 27% [1]\nSauder says Conservatives 38%, Liberals 31%, NDP 27% (for a plurality of seats) [2] The Sauder market is more liquid, so I would put more trust in it, but neither market is incredibly liquid (I'm trying to beat the Sauder market, so I don't believe that it is perfect).  Current polls put the three main parties all at about 30%, with the Conservatives projected to win the most seats, and the Liberals the fewest [3].  Some might find it relevant that the Conservatives significantly outperformed polls in the last election. The party that wins the most seats is not certain to form the government.  In the Canadian system, the incumbent party is, by default, given the first chance to form the government (although they might decline this opportunity).  Thus, the Conservatives are probably slightly more likely to form the next government than win a plurality of seats.  On the other hand, there is the possibility of a Liberal-NDP coalition could form the next government even if the Conservatives win the most seats.  I am going with the Sauder numbers, with my odds slightly increased for the Conservatives, and switched for the Liberals and NDP. As a Canadian, I have a lot more background knowledge about this question than most GJP questions, but I'm not sure this is actually helpfully.
