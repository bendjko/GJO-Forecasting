Based on the following questions ...\na)  How likely are HDX to \"give up\" each week, and leave the data set incomplete?\nb)  How likely is an outbreak each week?\nc)  If an outbreak, what are the likely number of deaths each day?\nd)  If no outbreak, what are the likely number of deaths each day?\ne)  How much scatter can be expected around the figures in c) and d)?\nd)  How much time remains? Most likely outcome is the status quo, leading to a gradual improvement, and deaths coming in under 2300 (47%).  Next most likely outcome is the HDX data collection becoming so sporadic that they fail to keep count, and their total gets \"stuck\" under 2300 regardless of what the actual death count is (39%).\n"], [1333, "2017-11-23T23:11:34Z", [0.85, 0.15, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [23234, "2017-11-23T15:24:42Z", [0.6, 0.26, 0.11, 0.03], "KSA blockade partially lifted."], [34821, "2017-11-23T06:19:48Z", [0.8, 0.15, 0.04, 0.01], ""], [41523, "2017-11-23T03:54:28Z", [0.75, 0.2, 0.03, 0.02], ""], [691, "2017-11-21T20:41:40Z", [0.9, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [38319, "2017-11-21T02:33:31Z", [0.8, 0.15, 0.04, 0.01], "Crunching the numbers.  Point Case Fatality Rate (as opposed to cumulative CFR) has been essentially bi-modal.  Before July, during the acceleration phase of the outbreak, the CFR was generally at or above 0.5% (1 in 200 cases died).  Since mid-August, the CFR has generally been at or below 0.05% (1 in 2000 cases die).  July and early August was a transition period between the two. So, given the 8 Nov data of 2196 deaths, it means that, in order to reach the 2300-2500 bracket, figures between 8 Nov and 28 Dec would need to demonstrate 2.1 deaths per day.  This would require either: DOUBLING the present number of cases per day, to 5000; or DOUBLING the present CFR to 0.08% (1 death in 1250 cases). Reaching the 2500-3000 bracket would require a return to the late-July peak transmission of cases (7000 cases per day) AND a more than doubling of the CFR. Reaching the 3000+ bracket becomes an exercise in improbability (essentially needing an entirely new outbreak). SO ... Present trends would indicate a forecast based on a bell-curve centred around 40 further deaths between 8 Nov and 28 Dec (or a total of around 2245). However, I see one of three possible outcomes here:\n1.  Trends continue as above, with slight variations in rates of new cases, or in CFR.\n2.  For whatever reason, HDX cannot or does not update their data all the way through until 28 December.\n3.  Catastrophe, and a new cholera outbreak (though it is hard to imagine how things could be _worse_ in Yemen, without also removing the ability of HDX to report accurate data). Outcome 1:\nHighly likely \"Less than 2300\", but small chance of \"2300-2500\". Outcome 2:\nAlmost certainty of \"Less than 2300\". Outcome 3:\nHighly likely \"2500-3000\", roughly equal chances of \"2300-2500\" or \"3000+\". And of the 3 outcomes, I think Outcome 1 is by far the most likely. Provisional forecast above.
