This is particularly true since repatriation of EUR currency held by US firms is likely to continue to take place as firms repatriate funds to take advantage of the new tax laws. At the same time, extensive losses seem unlikely; barring a massive external event, there's no reason to expect a major drop that would be needed to take the rate below 1.10.

Its passage in some form should boost the dollar (through expectations of a short-term fiscal impulse, which should lead to higher interest rates). There is a small chance that the final package may disappoint if it is seen as too timid relative to market expectations. And, of course, if nothing gets passed, the dollar will suffer. But I think this is a small chance as well.  - on the other hand, the Fed's policy that is baked in the cake seems clear - a hike in December, followed by another one no earlier than June 2018, plus the already announced gradual reduction of the balance sheet. So only deviations from this plan can produce news for the exchange rate. Unlikely for now. - on the European side, the news until Feb 15 are likely to be mainly political - the German situation, the Brexit discussions (to some extent), and, towards the end, expectations about the Italian elections.

The Fed plans are well known by now, and if anything risks are for slower interest rate hikes than expected by the markets (if the Fed gives priority to reducing its balance sheet);  - cyclical position of the US and euro area economies: the euro area is a couple of years behind the US in their cyclical recovery, so the pick-up in economic activity has probably longer to run there. This would induce capital flows to Europe, again supporting the euro;  - tax cut package in the US: this will probably appear for discussion in the fall, but the main points are already known from the one-pager published in April. Normally, this should push the US bond yields up, supporting the dollar (as it did after the US elections), but the second time around the effect would be muted, I think;  - trade barriers in the US, if such are introduced: by harming US economic activity, this should push US interest rates and the dollar down.  Much of this is already anticipated, hence the recent EUR/US$ exchange rate of 1.14. Still, most factors would seem to push for weaker dollar rather than a stronger one.

It becomes clear from the graph that from 2001 to 2009, the euro was getting stronger relative to the dollar, however, since then the dollar has gradually increased in value compared to the euro. Where \u20ac1 was $1.60 in 2008, the current exchange rate is \u20ac1 for $1.058. \nOne indicator for the exchange rate of either the dollar or the euro is the interest rate. Governments of every country give out bonds to finance their expenses, in return the buyers get a certain yield. If the interest rate is high, the bond yields are also high and therefore more attractive. Figure 3 shows the yield of a bond with a maturity of 10 years of the United States and figure for shows the same for Germany. As one can see, the yield on US treasury bonds is much higher than the yield on German bonds and therefore buyers are more inclined to purchase the former. Germany is used as an example here because it is the biggest economy in the EU and bonds are issued by governments and not by the European Union. In for example Greece the yield on bonds is much higher, yet this brings a higher risk for the buyer as well. When investors from outside the US buy US treasury bonds, they exchange the currency of their country for US dollars. In other words, they sell their currency and buy dollars. As a result, if the yield on treasury bonds of the US is higher than those o f Germany and other EU countries, then the demand for the US Dollar will increase relative to the demand for euros, which will lead to a lower value of the euro against US dollars.\nAnother strong indicator for developments in the exchange rate is trade. When a country exports a good, the demand for their currency will rise, whilst when importing a good the supply of their currency will rise. Keeping all other factors constant the former situation will lead to an appreciation of the dollar and the latter to a depreciation. In figure 5 the trade balance of the United States is shown, it becomes clear that there is an apparent trade deficit. President of the United States Donald Trump has indicated on many occasions that he finds this unacceptable and he has devised a plan to improve the trade balance. If this plan works out, there will be more export of US goods relative to import of goods to the US, resulting in an appreciation of the dollar. However, there is much uncertainty about whether Trump will succeed in decreasing the trade deficit. In Europe (figure 6) the general trend since 2010 seems to be a positive and improving trade balance over the past couple of years, yet at the moment  there is a substantial down fall. If the trend continues then this will lead to an appreciation of the euro in the coming years, keeping all other factors constant.\nIn conclusion, there is much uncertainty about what the value of the euro against the dollar will be next year. The bond yields give a clear indication of a strong US dollar relative to the euro, yet the trade balance and the Trump effect are much more ambiguous. My forecast will be that I expect the dollar to appreciate a little compared to the euro and therefore I estimate the chances of the value of the euro against the dollar to be between $1 and $1.10 70%. Furthermore I indicate a 20% chance for the value to be between $0.90 and a $15% chance for the value to be between $1.10 and $1.20. \n"], [14027, "2017-04-11T00:57:54Z", [0.01, 0.1, 0.39, 0.48, 0.02], ""], [33818, "2017-04-10T23:35:01Z", [0.06, 0.23, 0.3, 0.3, 0.11], ""], [3514, "2017-04-10T20:20:17Z", [0.04, 0.26, 0.52, 0.18, 0.0], ""], [22689, "2017-04-10T20:15:22Z", [0.0, 0.55, 0.45, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [29054, "2017-04-10T13:25:57Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.71, 0.29, 0.0], "Draghi is going to continue to support the Bond purchases and Germany is going to keep pushing for a lower Euro, thus a much narrower range for a longer period.

Two more U.S. rate hikes in 2017 plus one more potentially in 2018, raising the U.S. dollar. On the other hand, ECB has made some noise about hiking their overnight deposit rate as well. Still, US economy is doing better than Europe's so it's more likely to have the U.S. Fed move faster than the ECB. On the trade side, the Trump administration may scrap or rewrite agreements, hurting trade and devaluing the U.S. dollar. However, there is also populism rising in Europe which may also make it harder for Europe to sign new trade agreements, or even have to renegotiate new agreements.  On the balance of probabilities, the U.S. dollar appears to have more tailwinds than the Euro.
