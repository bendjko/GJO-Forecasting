Despite objectively losing almost every news cycle since he took office, Trump's approval rating among GOP voters is still at the same level in Gallup's tracking polls as George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan at this point in their presidencies.\" \"While Trump receives high ratings among Republicans, as the Post notes, he gets extremely low, single-digit approval ratings from Democrats and only about one-third approval from independents. That accounts for his historically low overall approval ratings among newly elected presidents in the summer of their first year. . . .  \"Trump's support has been stable. There has been little meaningful change since March, with his weekly averages ranging narrowly between 37% and 42%. This stability may result at least partly from the increased polarization . . . with both Republicans and Democrats firmly entrenched in their opinions.\n. . .\n\" . . .  About two-thirds of those who disapprove of Trump talk about his character, personal qualities and overall qualifications as their reasons for holding those attitudes. . . .  Approvers tend to talk about Trump's presidency more generally or mention issues.\n. . . \n\"One important fact about Trump is the degree to which some of his positions on the issues actually resonate with the public -- including spending a great deal of money on the nation's infrastructure, trying to bring manufacturing jobs back from overseas, helping veterans and creating more jobs in general. In fact, our new data show that Trump gets higher ratings for his stance on issues than for having the personality and qualities expected of a president. . . .  \"Trump, at least as measured by his job approval ratings, has not yet been able to maximize any advantage he might obtain from pushing policy positions that resonate with the public.\n. . . \n\"It is possible that Trump will change his personal style or bring about major breakthroughs on either the domestic or foreign scene, and, as a result, improve his image in the American public's eyes. Or, revelations relating to Russia or other issues now under active investigation by the special prosecutor or Congress will cause his ratings to drop further.

So if you think there is, in fact, a 100% chance that he'll have 38.00% support in the population on August 1st, you still should (assuming you're trying to match your prediction to that belief) allocate significant probability that error means it'll be reported at a 41% (within the 95% confidence level) or even 42+% (the 2.5% chance the poll is out of the confidence interval high).  If you're declaring 100% to between-30-and-40, you're predicting, more-or-less, that his actual support will be 34-36%.  (If I could remember more of my long-ago statistics classes, I could give you more precise advice, but it's been far too long.) Now, the model I use, operating directly on the frequency of given numbers in the Gallup reporting instead of a belief as to what Trump's underlying support is, should minimize avoid sampling uncertainties; all historical slop from sampling error is included.  (Did Trump's June 22 42% reflect reality or error?  My model doesn't care, it just cares with what frequency Trump gets a 41+.)  Its major deficiency -- and it IS a major one -- is that by dealing with those numbers directly, it is only indirectly linked to the underlying reality.  It's like trying to predict a stock's price based on the past performance of a stock, without any direct looks at the fundamentals or a study of market psychology or, well, anything.  My acknowledgment of that inherent uncertainty is the 1%s I spend on either side of the main prediction; whether it's adequate, excessive, or insufficient is, of course, hard to evaluate.

Unless he resigns or is impeached and convicted, I believe President Trump's approval rating will stick around 35% and when change happens, it will be quick, significant and very few people will have predicted the change accurately.     http://www.gallup.com/poll/201617/gallup-daily-trump-job-approval.aspx\nhttp://www.npr.org/2017/06/03/531088285/trump-s-approval-rate-decline-is-nothing-compared-to-other-presidents"], [34628, "2017-06-06T14:03:00Z", [0.01, 0.7, 0.29, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [33917, "2017-06-06T13:25:19Z", [0.0, 0.6, 0.4, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2017-06-06T12:23:24Z", [0.0, 0.68, 0.32, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [34353, "2017-06-06T11:59:25Z", [0.0, 0.65, 0.35, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [12828, "2017-06-06T11:43:33Z", [0.1, 0.48, 0.39, 0.03, 0.0], ""], [10935, "2017-06-06T05:44:52Z", [0.67, 0.25, 0.08, 0.0, 0.0], "Adjusted from earlier.

I used historical Gallop approval rating data since 1993 when Clinton was inaugurated to analyze how quickly approval ratings change.  Besides cases when a new president is inaugurated and the ratings apply to a different person, there was only one case where an extremely fast change occurred - the poll after 9-11 when George Bush's ratings improvement from 51 to 87%, including 27 to 82% for Democrats.  That case was considered an outlier - the table below shows the month to month deltas for percentage approval.  For the one month deltas, 90% were between a change of -6% and 5% change, and for the two month deltas, 90% were between -7% and 6% change. Since there are two months until this period and the rating is very close to 40% right now, I find it highly unlikely there will be more than a 10% change before August 1st (roughly 4% of historical cases have this much of a jump in either direction).  Due to Trump's loss of \"strong approval\" ratings have shrunk roughly 9% since he became president and his \"strong disapproval\" ratings have risen roughly 10%, I feel it more likely that he will suffer a decrease in approval in the next two months than an increase.  (See FiveThirtyEight https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/donald-trumps-base-is-shrinking/ for more information.)\nI also find it very likely he'll be within 5% of his current approval of roughly 40%, but it is difficult to assign probabilities to demonstrate that with the brackets that are provided.

For Trump to have such a high approval rating, there would need to be a major event like 9/11.

Even with the rise of ISIS, it is unlikely that a similar attack will occur because of increased American security since 9/11. Perhaps there might a crisis with North Korea that might lead to a spike in Trump's approval ratings. However, Kim Jong Un hasn't done anything spectacularly different since his inception.

Only 37 percent approve of his job performance, about the same as the 36 percent who approved two weeks ago. Fifty-nine percent say Trump is dishonest.\nSixty-six percent support the appointment of a special counsel to investigate possible improper links between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia. Trump opposed that investigation, but the Justice Department named former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel anyway.\n\"President Donald Trump remains mired in dreadful mid-30s approval numbers and the red flags that are popping up tell an even darker story,\" Tim Malloy, the poll's assistant director, told reporters. \"But by far the most alarming determination is that President Trump is abusing his office.\"\nhttp://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2017/05/28/523486/US-Trump-poll-foreign-trip\n__________________________\nCOMMENTS:  Trump supporters, however, may not read those news, and probably do not care a fig on how bad his performance was while abroad.  Gallup has his rating at 42 today; but: His approval rating is even worse than most people realize: While it fluctuates daily, Trump\u2019s Gallup approval rating has hovered around 40 percent for most of his time in office. Making him the \u201cpresident\u201d with the lowest approval rating at this point in their presidency in modern history. For comparison\u2019s sake, here\u2019s Barack Obama and George W. Bush\u2019s final approval ratings:\n* Obama: 59 percent\n* Bush: 34 percent\nWith an economy that\u2019s just as strong as it was when Barack Obama left in January with a 59 percent approval rating, Trump\u2019s number sits much closer to Bush\u2019s, who left office in the midst of the worst economic crash since the Great Depression.\nIf the economy falters, even a little, all things being what they are now (aka his unhinged behavior remaining what we\u2019ve seen thus far), Trump could reach never-before-seen levels of Americans who disapprove of the job he\u2019s doing as \u201cCommander-in-Chief.\u201d\nSo while an approval rating are between 35-40 percent is never good, seeing as it\u2019s this early into his administration, and the economy is still strong, Trump\u2019s numbers are actually worse than they appear. He spends several hours practically every morning obsessing over cable news: Despite what Trump thought going into this, being president is extremely difficult. It\u2019s a non-stop grind where you\u2019re never truly \u201coff the clock.\u201d\nHowever, despite the fact that presidents have a never-ending list of things to which they need to attend, it seems as if Trump spends several hours nearly every morning obsessing over what cable news morning shows are saying about him.\nLooking at Trump\u2019s Twitter rants, they mostly occur in the morning, around the same time most cable news networks are airing their morning shows such as Morning Joe, Fox & Friends, and New Day.\nSome have even pointed out how Trump\u2019s tweets often mirror things he clearly just heard on his favorite morning show, Fox & Friends.\nThis is how obsessed he is with what people are saying about him.

Trump\u2019s sizable and enthusiastic base \u2014 perhaps 35 to 40 percent of the country \u2014 won\u2019t abandon him any time soon, the theory goes, and they don\u2019t necessarily care about some of the controversies that the \u201cmainstream media\u201d treats as game-changing developments. It\u2019s an entirely reasonable theory. We live in a highly partisan epoch, and voters are usually loyal to politicians from their party. Trump endured a lot of turbulence in the general election but stuck it out to win the Electoral College. The media doesn\u2019t always guess right about which stories will resonate with voters. But the theory isn\u2019t supported by the evidence. To the contrary, Trump\u2019s base seems to be eroding. There\u2019s been a considerable decline in the number of Americans who strongly approve of Trump, from a peak of around 30 percent in February to just 21 or 22 percent of the electorate now. (The decline in Trump\u2019s strong approval ratings is larger than the overall decline in his approval ratings, in fact.) Far from having unconditional love from his base, Trump has already lost almost a third of his strong support. And voters who strongly disapprove of Trump outnumber those who strongly approve of him by about a 2-to-1 ratio, which could presage an \u201centhusiasm gap\u201d that works against Trump at the midterms. The data suggests, in particular, that the GOP\u2019s initial attempt (and failure) in March to pass its unpopular health care bill may have cost Trump with his core supporters.\nhttps://fivethirtyeight.com/features/donald-trumps-base-is-shrinking/\n__________________________________\nCOMMENTS:  We see a considerable amount of articles interviewing Trumps supporters if they are still faithful.

Using just Gallup's average change in approval for Trump every 30 days so far, I would find that from day 1 to day 194 (Aug 1) there would be a drop of ~11.5% in approval, for a rating of 33.5%. Intuitively I find something similar to this to be the most likely - Trump is already down close to his core support group for these approval ratings, and it would be hard to definitively shake tons of support from them OR for him to make a large turnaround. However, polls thus far haven't really captured potential fallout from the Comey/Flynn revelations of the past week so things may go further underwater for him soon.  A swing to put Trump below 30% would need to be large and sustained - something like multiple big news items in the next two-ish months. Not impossible, but these would need to be items that shook even diehard supporters. There is potential for this with recent Russia investigation updates. On the flip side, a jump of 15-25 points in that time would need to convince a lot of people that Trump is doing a good job. Only certain kinds of events can do this in a short time (e.g., a magic bipartisan tax plan?, terrorist attack?) and so I find this unlikely.  Because of the trends in his approval going generally downward and the fact that disapproval has been going UP more consistently, I think there could be the most reason to expect him to end up in the sub-40 range around August 1st.

In the event of an international conflict it is likely to go above 40. Although there is a reasonably high probability of more scandals coming out, he has too much of a base that doesn't care what he does to go less than 30 percent -- he was probably right when he said he could shoot somebody and his base wouldn't care. But, at the end of his term GWB did go down to 25 percent. But his sub-30s were short-lived and at the tail of his presidency.  I also don't see a big rally around the flag ala George W. after 9/11 should a big terrorist attack happen (but a conflict with North Korea could change this).

(It would be a positive if it is completed without implicating DT's campaign, but I don't think it will finish by Aug 1). \n - DT's chest-thumping on trade issues is a small positive for him, keeps the base happy.  \n - And the twitting habit has subsided, which keeps everyone happy.
