Life expectancy at birth for males, according to the World Bank for Afghanistan, is ~62 (2015 data). According to Wikipedia, Ashraf Ghani, is 68 years old and thus has surpassed national life expectancy data. According to online sources, Ghani does not seem to have any public health records showing any diseases or issues (i.e., heart issues). Ashraf Ghani's personal indicators show that as a healthy individual, he will not cease to be president of Afghanistan. However, according to the World's Bank's poverty headcount ratio at national poverty lines (% of population), 35.8% live at the poverty line as of 2015. This is an important indicator on the national level to assess public opinion and health of citizens. In 2017 Trump announced new plans for the \"war\" in Afghanistan - which he will not stay consistent on as he does not stay focus on one thing, rather tends to focus on domestic politics. In 2014, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry set up an agreement that placed Ghani in power; thus the US really cannot remove him from the given power. Ghani's removal will have to come from a national movement, citizens protesting Taliban and ISIS controlled areas to the government.  Since Ghani's support does not come from Afghan minorities - July 1 2018 is too soon for a removal of the president by the minorities of the country. According to The Diplomat \"The most recent survey conducted on the people of Afghanistan showed that the public\u2019s faith in state institutions stood at a 10-year low, with only 37 percent of those surveyed holding confidence in the Afghan parliament and 35 percent confident in government ministers. The impact of identity politics is most visible in the survey when seen through ethnic lines.\" I will take longer than July 2018 in order to leadership exit that will cause conflict/war in Afghanistan since it is a weak state but does have a strong society embedded in religion and nationalism.

The low probability of this event occurring is based upon several factors.  The event has only about 4 months and 1 week to occur.  Ashraf Ghani has been president of Afghanistan since 2014 and does not seem to be interested in stepping down voluntarily or due to a democratic election.  Afghanistan\u2019s Independent Election Commission announced that the country will hold its parliamentary and district council elections on 7 July 2018, which is 6 days after the 1 July 2018 deadline in the question.  Also, this proposed election is scheduled to take place 3 years past the expiration of the sitting parliament\u2019s 5-year mandate.  A reshaping of the parliament and district councils could factor into Ghani\u2019s decision to step down, but in the unlikely event that it even takes place, it will occur after the deadline in the question.  Historically, elections in Afghanistan face major hurdles and difficulties due to declining security and safety in many parts of the country.  The political instability and the public\u2019s insecurity will likely derail the parliamentary election, which undoubtedly will result in Ghani\u2019s power grip on the Afghani presidency.  Ghani is a slow reformer and takes many actions that may be deemed as autocratic in nature, which impede the opposition to form and contest the government\u2019s power.

Potential flashpoints:  Resurrgences of Taliban and US Troop Deployment - \nThe Taliban has resurfaced and have received re-newed focus by the Trump Administration. This has led to an increase in the deployment of US troops, which could counter the threat posed by this group, decrease the number of attacks by it, and thus address security concerns.\nOr, this could also incite the Taliban to carry out more attacks on both Afghanis and foreigners. There was a recent attack by the Taliban in January 2018 that killed over 100 people. More attacks like this wouold most likely lead to more anti-government protests calling at the minimum for security reforms, such as in July 2017. This troop deployment would seem to put the focus on the US as compared to the Afghani President. That being said, there is the other possibility that the President could be perceived as in league with the US.  Islamic State - \nThe Islamic State has had attacks in Afghanistan as late as 2017. This is another threat to President Ghani's power that he has to address. Ethnic tensions - \nThere has been ongoing ethnic tensions in the country. The President has not helped bridge these gaps, instead making preferential appointments to people who are part of his Pashtun ethnic group, and minimalizing the role of the Hazara, Tajik and Uzbek groups. This does not appear to have improved with the attempted and resisted recall of two governors. Potential ways the President could be removed:\nVoted out of office - There is no election before July 2018. I was unable to find immediate information in regards to the possibility of a special election.  Killed - He could be killed or assassinated, by a rival ethnic group, the Uprising for Change Protesters, or the Taliban. Whether one considers the possibility of Ghani being removed from office via diplomatic or undiplomatic, peaceful or violent means, there does not seem to be enough incentive at this late stage. A move to outster him by a rival ethnic group would spoil any chance they had at leading a unified Afghanistan. \nNow this may change if he runs for re-election and succeeds or appears about to succeed.\nThe Taliban is the wild card as it is an ever-present threat and they have less reason to mind the democratic process. As stated previously, they carried out an attack in January, so the probability cannot be 0%. NOTE: All of this is couched on the rational-actor model. It is entirely possible that any actor, whether an individual, ethnic, group, political party or institution could have a different mental-calculus from what we consider rational.

I was attracted to this question because the crowd consensus (0% at the moment) implies that a 68-year-old Afghan will 100% likely still be alive in 7 months.  That is ... overconfident. Let's start with with the basics.  A 68yo male in a first world setting (and Ghani has been raised in a family situation that afforded him the opportunities of higher education, so that dataset is probably more relevant than the life expectancy of a 68yo Afghan goat herder) has a roughly 2% chance of dying in the next 12 months.  Ghani is known to have had a partial gastrectomy for cancer (http://edition.cnn.com/2014/12/08/world/ashraf-ghani-fast-facts/index.html), and is in what would be one of the most stressful and physiologically draining jobs in the world.  Those factors in themselves would probably double his risk of death = 4% in 12 months, call it  2% in the next 7 months. Then factor in the risk of violent death and \"disappearance\", or the risk of the Afghan regime collapsing ...  Those are not quantifiable for me, but would have to be more than 0%.  Especially so as the current power sharing arrangement (president vs CEO) seems to be unstable, and seems to put Abdullah in a prime position to push for sole presidency if Ghani shows any weakness, or becomes a liability in the eyes of the foreign sponsors of the Afghan government.  So, what, a 1 in 50 (2%) chance of something blowing up politically (or literally)? That gives a total 0.04 probability for the question.  In other words, 1:24 odds that Ghani will [cease to be]:[remain] president.
