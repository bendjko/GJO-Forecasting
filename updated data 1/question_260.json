I am not certain how far the \"off ramp\" capability would extend from the expressway, but, road conditions may also change rapidly, from being leaf covered in the fall, to snow and ice covered in the winter, possibly moving from a well maintained interstate highway onto an unmarked winding pothole filled gravel road. Given the NTSB investigation into the current list of Tesla Autopilot accidents, it seems unlikely that there would be a mass distribution of the new capability, before the current issues are resolved.  Launching this type of software going into the winter months of the US might not be the safest testing opportunity.  On the other hand, Tesla wants to push the envelope, and reports are that the Beta version is already being road tested.  Another uncertainty for question resolution may be the country location of the download.  Tesla could make the \"Off Ramp\" software available in limited worldwide areas, excluding the US. How widely the software needs to be distributed to meet the question criteria seems uncertain.
