There is little doubt that the president and FARC will ultimately deliver some type of document, such as a permanent cease-fire, to sign by the agreed date, if only to save face and reassure the population that the process is still on track. But it seems extremely unlikely that the March 23 date will bring the more conclusive deal that was originally intended. \"Much has transpired since the heady days early last month when Santos was being discussed as a potential Nobel Peace Prize winner and President Barack Obama warmly welcomed his \u201cgood friend, President Santos,\u201d and Santos\u2019 wife to the White House. The latest poll by Gallup Colombia, taken during the final 10 days of February, shows a stunning collapse in support for Santos and his peace plan. Only 24 percent approve of the Colombian president\u2019s performance in office. Support for the peace process is also in trouble, with just 37 percent saying they believe the peace process is on the right track.  \"Colombians are feeling so ambivalent about what they are witnessing that only 30 percent say they will definitely vote in the referendum to ratify an eventual peace deal. Among those, a slim majority of 53 percent say they will vote in favor of the accord. . . .  Assuming an agreement is reached, which remains the likely outcome, it is quite possible that the referendum campaign will motivate more Colombians to go to the polls. \"Until then, however, the path forward for Santos has become doggedly complicated.  \"FARC negotiators understand that Santos, who has staked his presidency on ending the half-century-old war, will not let the peace process collapse. They are leveraging that psychological advantage to demand compromises that Santos may approve, but which the Colombian people reject. \"Santos, who has staked his presidency on ending the half-century-old war, will not let the peace process collapse.\nIt all adds up to a dilemma for Santos. In order to get FARC to sign a deal, he is under pressure to offer concessions that could doom the referendum. Making matters worse, his popularity, setting aside the peace process, is taking a beating from a host of other factors . . .  \" . . .  a video recorded in late February showed FARC leaders flanked by machine-gun-toting guerrillas, in violation of the terms of the agreement. The video went viral, and the state prosecutor launched an investigation of the minister of defense and top military officials to determine whether they withdrew Colombian forces from the area, leaving the population under FARC control during the visit. To many Colombians, it was a sign of how FARC is outplaying the government and cannot be trusted. \"The issue of what will happen to FARC\u2019s weapons is one of the top sources of concern. Guerrilla negotiators are playing semantic games, saying they will not hand over their weapons, but only set them aside. And they are demanding to decide who will stockpile them. One FARC negotiator has even suggested that the military, too, ought to disarm. Colombians are also troubled by demands from the guerrillas to choose the makeup of the tribunals that will judge them, along with reports that any FARC members that are eventually sanctioned will be allowed to run for office even while serving their punishments. Those punishments are expected, per earlier agreements, to be rather mild, a point that angers Colombians.  \"Former President Alvaro Uribe, now in Congress, remains the top critic of the deal and the \u201cimpunity\u201d he maintains it will produce despite the grave crimes committed by FARC members. . . . \"But Santos also has a full plate of problems that could weigh on his efforts to persuade Colombians to support a deal. The collapse of oil prices has slashed government revenues and dealt a blow to the currency, which has lost half its value, reducing purchasing power and stoking inflation. The central bank is hiking rates to tamp down inflation, adding to the pressure on economic growth. The economy, which had been growing at a strong clip, is slowing noticeably. The president just announced a cut in government spending, even as the unemployment rate has climbed.In the meantime, a severe drought, along with mismanagement, has depleted hydroelectric production. Water and electricity shortages are adding to popular irritation with the government. And the proliferation of corruption scandals in the administration is hurting the president. Although he has not been directly linked to the cases, they are likely turning him into a less credible advocate for his policies, including the peace process. When the minister of mines and energy resigned this week, Santos had to clarify that it was because of the energy crisis, not because of corruption schemes to which the minister has been linked. Other Cabinet members under investigation include the ministers of the interior, health, housing and defense.  \"It all adds to a complicated picture for a president who remains determined to reach a final peace agreement, and a population that wants peace but is skeptical that this process will produce a lasting version of it.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  This piece has almost a panicky sound to me; I wonder if it's a negotiating tactic.   It's always coldest just before dawn.  \n~~~~~~~~~~\nhttp://www.newsfultoncounty.com/politics/news/1029360-farc-open-to-extending-peace-talks-in-colombia The FARC guerrilla group on Thursday announced its willingness to set a new date for a final peace accord with the Colombian government.  \u201cWe are in agreement that another mutually agreed date can be reached,\u201d said . . .  a spokesperson for the group. . . .

It seems to me that the negotiators on both sides have little incentive to arrive at a deal when they can enjoy life at government expense in a hotel in Havana.

Going to 50%."], [38, "2016-03-10T23:36:44Z", [0.1], "http://www.as-coa.org/articles/update-colombias-do-list-ahead-peace-deadline  \" . . .  with several complicated points still unresolved, both sides are backing off the March 23 itself, albeit still committed to signing an agreement in 2016. \n. . . \n\"This week, the Colombian Congress approved a law that grants the government the power to create demobilization zones, areas in which the country\u2019s security forces won\u2019t be allowed to arrest FARC members even if there is a warrant out on the guerillas. The government\u2019s idea is that, if an agreement is reached, guerrilla members will congregate in these zones to safely turn in their weapons. But some are concerned the FARC won\u2019t hold up its end of this portion of the deal. . . . The debate in Congress on demobilization zones has prompted criticism from the opposition, which wants to avoid a repeat of the El Cagu\u00e1n incident in the early 2000s. In that case, then-President Andr\u00e9s Pastrana cleared security forces from 16,200 square miles in southern Colombia to get FARC leaders to agree to peace talks there, but the rebels took the opportunity to regroup. \n. . . .\n\"Negotiators in Havana will also have to put mechanisms in place to ensure that guerillas will be reintegrated into civilian life. Both sides have diverging reasons for achieving this goal. The FARC wants to be sure that their unarmed members won\u2019t become victims of targeted killings, as other leftist groups have been in the past upon turning in their weapons. . . .  \"Meanwhile, the government is also interested in guaranteeing that demobilized guerrilla members won\u2019t join the loosely organized criminal gangs, known as Bacrim, which would become the country\u2019s largest illegal armed group once the FARC disarm. Specifically to guard against this, President Juan Manuel Santos said that any demobilized FARC member who commits a new crime will be subject to extradition to the United States, something fighters who disarm under the agreement won\u2019t face.   \"The last point to be agreed upon, which involves financing, monitoring, verification, and implementation of the peace agenda and post-conflict efforts, might prove to be the thorniest. The peace agreement would create a bureaucratic apparatus of commissions and special courts for transitional justice and truth commissions, as well as requiring spending on victim reparations and infrastructure building. But the country currently is facing financial pains . . .  Obama recently pledged to ask U.S. Congress to increase the amount to $450 million for 2017. But . . .  Bank of America estimated the total cost for 10 years of post-conflict efforts to be about $16.8 billion, or 1 percent of GDP per year. The Colombian Congress wants to budget even more. Roy Barreras, the leader of the governing Party of the U, calculated the cost for 10 years at $28.1 billion and asked for 2 percent of the country\u2019s GDP to be destined to cover post-conflict costs. If the peace agreement is signed, the Colombian Congress will then have to vote and approve this new budget and post-conflict line item. \"What\u2019s more, it remains undecided how transitional justice\u2014the parallel legal system that will try crimes connected to the Colombian conflict\u2014will work, and Santos has so far issued only partial explanations. This means that the number of special judges is still to be determined and costs can change, but also that there is plenty to discuss when it comes to the minutiae of these justice mechanism. It also remains to be seen whether the agreement would satisfy international legal requirements Colombia is party to, or if it would be granting impunity to convicted criminals, as some legal experts claim.   \"The last point of negotiations deals with the means by which Colombians can accept or reject an agreement signed by the government and the FARC in Havana. Congress already approved the final text of the negotiations to be put before voters through a plebiscite, scheduled for no later than four months after the final signature of the peace agreement, and which must receive support of 13 percent of Colombia\u2019s electorate, or 4.4 million votes in the affirmative. But the FARC leaders believe this is a one-sided solution, as they will not have a say on the text of the question put to voters. Instead, the FARC have been pushing for a constituent assembly, which the government strongly opposes because each negotiating point would have to be approved\u2014and debated\u2014one by one. As chief negotiator Humberto de La Calle said, \u201c[A constituent assembly] would not be an end to dialogue. On the contrary, it\u2019d start the process all over again.\u201d \"In February, Santos said that if the deadline is not met, \u201cColombians will understand that the FARC is not ready for peace.\u201d But now both sides seem to be backing off the March 23 date. The group\u2019s lead negotiator Iv\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez hinted that they are willing to continue the talks until later this year. On March 3, Foreign Minister Mar\u00eda \u00c1ngela Holgu\u00edn said that \u201csomething will be signed on March 23,\u201d opening up the possibility that only a partial agreement is reached that day. Then on March 9, Santos himself said, \"I am not going to sign a bad agreement just to meet a deadline...If a good deal has not been reached by March 23, I will tell the other side of the table, 'Let's set another date.'\" He added, \"I hope we can sign. Negotiators are in the final stretch.\"\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  Oh, boy,  I got suckered.

The FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) negotiation team in Havana stated that they feel a final end to over 50 years of conflict could be negotiated by the end of 2016. However, this torpedoed an earlier estimate by the Colombian government that a final deal could be signed on Mar. 23. In a press release, the head of the FARC team, Ivan Marquez, expressed \"certainty\" that a peace agreement would eventually put an end to the war. However, this is contingent on finding compromise on a number of areas, including disarmament and the political rehabilitation of FARC members.

The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia has said its movement is \u201cfully prepared\u201d to agree to a \u201ctimetable and roadmap\u201d to reach a final peace deal between the two sides \u201cwithout delay.\u201d The peace negotiations had set a self-imposed deadline of March 23 to sign a peace accord in Havana to bring an end to the over three-year peace process and five-decade conflict, but various setbacks have made meeting the proposed date increasingly unlikely. The government, on the other hand, has not changed its tune that 2016 is the year of peace heralded by Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos at the New Year, but it seems that officials may no longer see March as the month for peace in the South American country. \u201cThis is an important year for the history of Colombia,\u201d Foreign Minister Maria Angela Holguin said during an address to the U.N. Human Rights Council on Wednesday, adding that the peace process in Havana has reached its final stages. \u201cWe expect that 2016 will mark the end of the over 50 year armed conflict, the largest in the western hemisphere.\u201d Both Holguin and Marquez acknowledged that the peace process has achieved major developments and historic agreements have been met. However, challenges still remain as the negotiators work through the final steps. \u201cExperience at the (negotiating) table has showed that when acts are done without taking the counterpart into consideration, the negotiation falls into the swamp and impedes progress,\u201d said Marquez, adding that achieving a bilateral cease-fire, ending paramilitary activity, and ensuring the FARC\u2019s transformation into a legal political movement remain key obstacles to be overcome. IN DEPTH: The Colombian Peace Process Explained On the government side, efforts to remove landmines are seen as crucial priority in ensuring stable and lasting peace, Holguin said. Last May, both sides of the conflict agreed to launch a preliminary demining initiative after the country saw more than 11,000 people injured or killed over the last 15 years. The peace process has got back underway with full force after a government uproar over a visit by Marquez and other FARC leaders to the town of El Conejo earlier this month where photos showed armed rebels were in the vicinity of the leaders FARC negotiator Ivan Marquez visits El Conejo, Feb. 18, 2016. The government accused the negotiators of breaking the rules of camp visits and banned them from making such trips. The FARC accused the country\u2019s right wing of creating an \u201cunwarranted controversy\u201d over the visit. Cuba and Norway, the two guarantor countries supporting the peace process, had to step in to smooth over the situation after the controversy launched an impasse at the negotiating table. Both sides also agreed to a protocol for FARC tours to communicate peace process progress. While it seems unlikely the two sides of the conflict will meet the self-imposed deadline of having a final peace agreement March 23, FARC and government negotiators agree that peace is near.\n[...]\nWhile it seems unlikely the two sides of the conflict will meet the self-imposed deadline of having a final peace agreement March 23, FARC and government negotiators agree that peace is near. \n~~~ COMMENT: So, a bit of optimism from this link, but still, doesn't sound promising for March 23rd.

According to De la Calle, the second item of the meeting will be setting up the protocols for the visit of spokespeople for the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia-People's Army (FARC-EP), given its importance.\n(http://www.plenglish.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=4639851&Itemid=1) COMMENTs: \n- maybe its Colombian prudence to manage expectations (status quo) with a less optimistic tone, but I think this echoes theWaPo sentiments I linked to yesterday; Mar 23 could indeed have a significant signing of sorts, but it might not be the final agreement. \n- maybe I'm dicing De la Calle's words too much, but he's talking about outlining a *plan* on how to commence and speed up negotiations, not about *resuming* negotiations where they left off before Marquez left. Semantics perhaps, but the fact remains that the FARC needs to visit/circulate the negotiation progress and proposals with their people; but to do this armed was a dumb decision; they'll have to go back (or I guess stay, since I think Marquez hasn't returned to Havana yet) and this will take time. \n- the ELN is in its beginning negotiation process with the Colombian government. Their not in the news as much, and they're not included in this question resolution criteria, but they are included in FARCs resolution criteria, so to speak. Will have to monitor how much the FARC tie up their own agreement with the ongoing of the ELN's, if at all.\nRegarding President Obama's visit & timing to Cuba:\n- I think *Cuba issues (travel, trade, embargo, Guantanamo Bay, etc) more than fill the President's <48 hrs on island before leaving for Argentina. He's already promised Colombia/FARC $400M+ for the *post*-agreement implementation plan, does his physical appearance at the end of March makes the carrot any fatter? I can definitely see a comment about \"reaffirming the promised $aid\" or \"applauding the Cuba/Norwegian efforts and progress thus far\"; obviously, if there is indeed a final peace deal drafted, his timing couldn't be more perfect (US approval on the 22nd, have it announced on the 23d.)

They tend to fail way more often than they succeed, even if they get signed.\nHowever, I am optimistic. The government may indeed get a better deal in the future (https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/144211), but on the other hand this depends on wether the FARC-negotiators would be able to maintain their influence inside FARC, if these talks fail right now. The gov. is still facing the left-wing ELN and strong right-wing rebelgroups and needs it resources for them. Therefore that approach may be too risky. Furthermore, Santos political 'destiny' seems to be pretty much bound to the conclusion of a peace deal by now. He is facing a strong opposition and harsh criticism for these talks. I doubt he will survive a failure politically. The FARC know that too, of course. So in fact, both sides want that deal. UN support is already agreed upon (which is a huge milestone), and US aid-money will start to flow in, once the deal got signed and approved. All in all, there are strong incentives for the conclusion of a deal. The only things that worry me, are the US-Terrorlist and the timeframe. Naturally, both parties will continue to try to push the agreement in a better direction for themselves. They may overstep at some point and might then need time to reconsider their positions. There are no lurking sanctions in place, that may force the negotiators to finish the talks in the agreed-upon timeframe (Contrary to the recent peace deal in South Sudan, where IGAD+ succesfully threatened to sanction both negotiating parties. However, this still did not lead to an actual implemention of the deal.) Regarding the US-Terrorlist: The FARC will not be taken down until they signed the treaty, got rid of all their arms and until it got acknowledged by the US, that they no longer pose a threat. This may take 1-3 years even if everything is going great. But the fact that Santos publicly stated that he is unhappy with that procedure I think makes his commitment to the talks clear. The FARC may have hoped for the US to be less resistant, however that's the standard procedure by the US as far as I know and the FARC might have anticipated that outcome beforehand anyway. I am not sure WHO exactly is on that list and/or who would be really threatened by a peace deal (and the loss of fighters/weapons) inside FARC. And I doubt that the FARC are sure themselves. Downside: I am also not sure wether the negotiators returned to Cuba yet:\n\"4.

They were launched in Havana in November 2012. Since then, agreement has been reached on the political participation of the rebels, land reform, drug trafficking and transitional justice.

On January 25, The UN Security Council approved \"a political mission to monitor the implementation of a peace deal between the Colombian government and the rebel Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC),\" following the request made by the parties.  This political mission was set to last 12 months.  And its creation is supposed to be seen as a strong signal that a MARCH 23 DEADLINE TO REACH THE FINAL AGREEMENT COULD BE WITHIN REACH.  This peace process has been in the making for four years.  January's announcement was seen, in Latin America, as a big victory.  The negotiations started in 2012 and came in four stages:   1) The first stage which was the phase of secret meetings and exploratory talks that lasted 6 months.  \n2) The second which focused on making concrete agreement plans and discussions regarding policies for agricultural development; the political participation that members of FARC would have in government once disarmament happens; drug trafficking control policy, and reparations to the victims of the conflict (FARC and government victims).   \n3) A third stage which covered ratification of the agreement and signatures\n4) And a fourth, which is the implementation of the agreement.   The agreement is at the final stretch - hopefully - BUT MARCH 23 is fast approaching and just this week, the government of Colombia stopped FARC leaders visit to the country which they said was to brief fighters on the peace talks.   The government claimed FARC HAD VIOLATED THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT because FARC leaders Ivan Marquez, Jesus Santrich and Joaquin Gomez, who had traveled from Havana, Cuba, had \"met with local residents and participated in public events with armed fighters despite restrictions on such activities.\"  \"On instruction of the president, pedagogical visits by FARC delegates to their encampments to explain the accords are suspended,\" \n\"A fundamental rule of the agreement was that they do not make politics with arms and so this is an unacceptable violation.\" Doesn't seem like this violation of the agreement is so egregious that the progress made will be undone but it may be an indicator of how seriously or not the parts are taking the terms.    IF THE MARCH 23 DEADLINE IS MISSED, THEN THAT COULD BE A SET BACK FOR THE ACCORD.  LET'S KEEP AN EYE ON THAT DATE.

The other issue is the United States' list of terrorist organizations and threats to extradite about 50 FARC members wanted on drug trafficking charges. Santos has prevented extradition in the past, but it's unclear if he will be able to get a blanket commitment from the US not to pursue it. US has said that FARC will not be removed from terrorist list until after they give up arms, so the order in which things need to be done may be an obstacle.

Feb 14: From The Bogota Post -- \"Peace Process Latest:\" --> http://thebogotapost.com/2016/02/14/peace-process-latest-8/ A new round of talks began on February 2, possibly taking the process into its final stretch after the parties agreed to reach a final deal by March 23. FARC representatives have cast doubt on the viability of signing an agreement by that date, but President Santos remains optimistic. \u201cWe are seriously trying to meet the deadline. In the end, it won\u2019t matter if the deal is signed two days later, one day before or one week later,\u201d he affirmed during his visit to Washington last week. \u2013 There are various topics still pending, including: the bilateral and definitive ceasefire and cessation of hostilities between the parties; the laying down of arms and reintegration of FARC members into civilian life; the fight against remaining criminal organisations, impunity and corruption; the implementation of relevant institutional reforms to guarantee a sustainable peace; and the creation of a suitable mechanism for the implementation and verification of the final peace agreement. \u2013 On January 21, Colombia freed 16 imprisoned rebels convicted of nonviolent crimes who had been granted a presidential pardon in November as part of a unilateral confidence-building gesture. The move marks an important step forward, especially after the FARC had criticised the government for unnecessarily delaying their release. Four of the released rebels have gone on to travel to Havana to participate in the new round of talks. \u2013 The negotiating parties jointly requested a UN-spearheaded mechanism to act as an international observer and verifier of the bilateral ceasefire and the laying down of arms. The UN Security Council acted swiftly and just days later, on January 25, responded by agreeing to create a 12-month political mission for this purpose. \u2013 To commemorate 15 years of Plan Colombia, a USD$10 billion US-sponsored counterinsurgency and anti-drug program, President Santos met with Barack Obama in Washington. Obama announced that the United States will ramp up its annual budget for Colombia from USD$300-$450 million to support the peace process. \u2013 In a speech delivered to the European Parliament on January 28, FARC lead negotiator Iv\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez asked the European Union to remove the left-wing rebel group from its list of terrorist organisations. Santos used the occasion of his visit to the White House to request that the United States do the same. Meanwhile, Bernie Aronson, US special envoy to the peace talks in Havana, has stated that the FARC\u2019s removal from the US list of terrorist groups is strictly contingent on a number of factors. In an interview with El Tiempo, he explained that the FARC would first \u201chave to disarm, end all criminal activities and stop forming a risk for US interests.\u201d ~~~ COMMENT: I'm not necessarily more pessimistic on this IFP, just recalibrating a bit to the consensus."], [1646, "2016-02-15T19:40:06Z", [0.55], ""], [1708, "2016-02-15T19:20:03Z", [0.7], ""], [20036, "2016-02-15T19:08:41Z", [0.05], ""], [67, "2016-02-15T17:59:58Z", [0.63], ""], [19994, "2016-02-15T17:54:09Z", [0.55], ""], [10759, "2016-02-15T17:06:04Z", [0.45], ""], [4634, "2016-02-15T17:05:51Z", [0.45], ""], [19170, "2016-02-15T15:12:25Z", [0.75], ""], [10219, "2016-02-15T14:59:43Z", [0.65], ""], [128, "2016-02-15T14:08:00Z", [0.5], ""], [19599, "2016-02-15T05:07:45Z", [0.62], ""], [19078, "2016-02-15T04:54:10Z", [0.15], ""], [19106, "2016-02-15T03:55:34Z", [0.62], ""], [19936, "2016-02-15T03:39:02Z", [0.0], ""], [20008, "2016-02-15T03:30:05Z", [0.25], ""], [13377, "2016-02-15T00:39:02Z", [0.65], ""], [9823, "2016-02-14T23:24:36Z", [0.1], ""], [19685, "2016-02-14T23:14:59Z", [0.35], "This has been in the works for years there are no deadlines- if it happens it happens"], [1218, "2016-02-14T21:53:54Z", [0.3], ""], [2281, "2016-02-14T21:31:33Z", [0.45], ""], [746, "2016-02-14T20:24:25Z", [0.05], ""], [1028, "2016-02-14T19:56:30Z", [0.75], ""], [14208, "2016-02-14T19:30:49Z", [0.06], "down another 1 point on @jlnado link."], [1380, "2016-02-14T16:07:27Z", [0.0], ""], [1526, "2016-02-14T16:03:21Z", [0.85], ""], [691, "2016-02-14T15:27:12Z", [0.58], ""], [405, "2016-02-14T14:47:14Z", [0.42], "- 7\nOne of the negotiator is telling that something doesn't facilitate negotiations:\n\u00abEn una declaraci\u00f3n le\u00edda por el negociador alias \u2018Rodrigo Granda\u2019, las Farc plantearon que: \u201cEl comunicado de la Oficina del Alto Comisionado para la Paz del 10 de febrero, en el que se amenaza con investigaciones por parte de las autoridades judiciales competentes a quienes se re\u00fanan con la Delegaci\u00f3n de las Farc sin autorizaci\u00f3n del Gobierno Nacional, aduciendo adem\u00e1s, que si bien tenemos \u2018\u00f3rdenes de capturas suspendidas\u2019 a\u00fan estamos en la ilegalidad, no ayuda a generar un ambiente propicio para el avance del proceso\u201d\nhttp://www.vanguardia.com/colombia/346926-farc-rechazan-anuncio-de-investigacion-a-quienes-se-reunan-con-su-delegacion"], [19951, "2016-02-14T05:43:34Z", [0.25], "The complexity and deep-seated nature the issues involved here make me doubt that an agreement will be reached by this point."], [19945, "2016-02-14T02:53:43Z", [0.0], ""], [19949, "2016-02-14T01:26:24Z", [0.45], ""], [231, "2016-02-14T00:29:10Z", [0.45], ""], [18945, "2016-02-14T00:28:48Z", [0.15], ""], [734, "2016-02-13T23:53:41Z", [0.62], "Reaffirming, but I think we can safely discount March 23rd... http://colombiareports.com/farc-brings-leftist-academics-to-havana-as-strategy-shifts/"], [12879, "2016-02-13T22:12:33Z", [0.6], ""], [368, "2016-02-13T20:39:05Z", [0.1], ""], [19935, "2016-02-13T19:55:26Z", [0.3], ""], [484, "2016-02-13T19:48:15Z", [0.15], "Down another 15% @adjes and @Flyn1200  Wonder why the wisdom of the crowd consensus is so high?

So, the government will take some time to delineate the agreeement (and have it reviewed by judicial authorities), align it with las Farc leadership, organise and perform the referendum, make results public and (in case las Farc does not raise any complaints) proceed with the transitional program. That is a lot of work to get done in a 2.5 months time window. Additionally, I sense a certain increase in hostility in the way President Juan Manuel Santos communicates his positions about Farc (example: on Twitter: \"Lo que se firme en La Habana lo someter\u00e9 a plebiscito, les guste o no a las Farc\" --- sounds rude for a native listener/reader). In another episode, in last December, President Juan Manuel Santos said that it is important to strengthen the military in order to reach and keep permanent peace, during a ceremony in la Escuela Militar de Cadetes, one of the most relevant military academies in Colombia. In South America, this message sounds strange because the military directly lead or sponsored many of the dictatorships regimes that doomed the region until very recently, so empowering the military sounds a bit like despair to me.

A final deal will be put to the people of Colombia in a referendum.\" So, to my understanding then, we don't need to wait for the results of the referendum. So long as FARC and the government sign the deal before May 1, that would resolve this IFP.

Leading negotiators for FARC have indicated publicly in Cuba during its recent negotiations with the Colombian ruling government that its (government) of a March deadline to complete all outstanding issues in the negotiations is naive, unreasonable and illusive.   A significant component yet to negotiated is the creating and establishment (which all agree would take at least a decade or more) of a sustainable economy in the FARC controlled territory among the landless, peasants and other classes.  Its illusive tasks are made difficult in that it needs to find an economy that can sustain and surpass the economic benefits of a narcoterrorist economy (cocaine).  With the additional two month requirement established by this question (beyond March) does not make an agreement more possible;  beside agreement substantively differs from signing an agreement.  The Colombian government is still beset with problems of regarding the ELN (a major guerilla organization) with whom it has no history of negotiations.   This dispels the fantasy that ongoing conflict interactions between it and the government, it and FARC could present significantly more dangers to a peace process, were it to be achieved.  So the question remains, given the status quo, or a move to FARC agreement and military integration, and the creation of an economy that is able to sustain a large population of FARC supporters and members in its territory, will peace move Colombia into an abyss much more aggressive than it current status.  At this posting, escalation in military conflict continues between the government and the ELN. Given these hurdles, my assessment is that a signed agreement will not be achieve despite the United State's commitment to providing a significant aid package (which it has been doing for year given the underdetermined problems of narcoterrorism) to provide incentives to move the agreement along as well as bring FARC into the fold and create a sustainable economy that will significantly soften Marxist grievances and suffering."], [19476, "2016-02-10T19:18:19Z", [0.32], "Government has incentives to comply with the agreed date (March 23th).

As stated earlier, the two sides reached partial agreements on four of the five points: land reform, political participation, drug trafficking, and transitional justice.  Pending issues include disarmament and how the final agreement will be approved, verified, and implemented.  The FARC has agreed to give up its weapons within 60 days after the final accord is signed. However, the government asserts that FARC members should surrender their weapons to the government, so they can never be used again. The FARC seeks to \"set aside\" their weapons, meaning the group will store its own arms with the implication that the FARC could at some point return to armed struggle. This remains an unresolved issue. \nSince the negotiations began, President Santos has promised that the Colombian people would approve the final peace agreement in some type of referendum.

The Colombia-FARC conflict is also known to be one of the longest armed conflict. Since November 2012, negotiators between the Colombian government and the FARC reached several agreements including the rebels' right to participate on political issues, transitional justice, drug trafficking and land rights. Out of the six agreements, the issue of disarmament remains unresolved citing the time when it will also take effect once agreed.

I hope today will mark the start of the final stage of peace talks.\" ~~~ Feb 2: \"U.S. ready to boost aid to Columbia in hopes of FARC peace deal\" --> http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/2/us-ready-to-boost-colombian-aid-in-hopes-of-farc-p/ The White House threw its weight behind Colombia\u2019s push for a major peace accord with leftist FARC rebels Tuesday, announcing that President Obama will ask Congress to ramp up security-related aid to the South American nation if a final deal gets signed in the months ahead. While officials refused to discuss specific numbers, they said the new aid plan will be center stage when Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos visits the White House Thursday and will exceed Washington\u2019s current assistance under the long-running Plan Colombia program, which has been in the $280 million range annually during recent years. The announcement comes ahead of a March 23 target for the formal end of hostilities between the Colombian government and the FARC \u2014 the Spanish acronym for the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia \u2014 that has killed 220,000 people and displaced millions since 1964. It\u2019s the longest-running conflict in the hemisphere. ~~ COMMENT: I'm going to start extra high on this one in anticipation of a signing in March (23rd, to be exact). Should things start to appear... less than amicable... I'll have to lower this one heavily.  The first link is the same BBC article from the \"more info.\" The second link throws a little bit of shade at the prospects of the peace deal, but I found the quote from the UN person encouraging. Lastly, the link I found that says the White House is getting beyond this, well, that seals it for me. I remember following IFPs with GJP, whenever I 'discovered' that the WH was behind something, that often -- to my memory -- gave it a better chance than not, of coming to pass. The last paragraph I included from the article about the WH, I think, is noteworthy: \"longest-running conflict in the hemisphere.\" Given the stifling relationship between the WH and Congress, I could see the Obama administration interested in getting a 'win' in another way. I'm a bit uneasy writing about such a terrible conflict in this way, but I'm trying to be objective in the analysis of the prospects of this IFP resolving in the affirmative.
