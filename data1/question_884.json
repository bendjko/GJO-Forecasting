All of them note how unsure they are and also note these points of concern: First, The Shape of Water wasn't nominated for Best Ensemble at the Screen Actor's Guild Awards - the last film to win Best Picture with the same circumstance was Braveheart in 1995. While Three Billboards has performed well at lead-up awards like BAFTA, pundits claim that the film may not perform as well in the Academy's preferential voting system, which tend to favor movies that all voters liked vice a film some voters adored and others hated. Get Out seems to embody the intangible argument amongst experts - the film was widely loved and topical, though it doesn't have the same pedigree as a more \"traditional\" Best Picture choice like the other two - though even this has holes in it given Shape being a fantasy film.

My projections were instead based on a mix of the projections of professional critics, my estimations of how political pressures might impact academy voters, and the types of films that have won in recent history.  As cynical as it may sound, I think the Academy is anxious to reduce some of the pressure of the #oscars-so-white twitter campaign from the previous two years and that pressure will give voters more incentive to vote for Get Out than they might have otherwise had. This is unfortunate as I believe the was excellent and would be absolutely deserving in the absence of any racial consideration. It also may mare the perception of it selection if were to win best picture as cynics will say it won as some form of racial appeasement. I think Three Billboads Outside Ebbing, Missouri best fits the mold of recent best picture selections, however I think Get Out was a far more unique form of story telling with equal depth and relevance and was flawlessly executed. I gave significant consideration to The Post and the Shape of Water as well. The Post is possibly the most in line with what a traditional Best Picture selection might look it and it of course has Meryl Streep who the most prolific oscar magnet in history. The Shape of Water could be a surprise and my be the most unique prospect but the credit I give it as prospect comes entirely from professional critics as i know very little about it and as a result may have undervalued its chances.

Other posts rave about the Oscar campaign Get Out put together.  My bet previously giving Get Out the edge was based on the idea The Academy is changing.  Question is whether it has changed enough.  Get Out is quite a story but will the Academy vote for something so unique vs a film that pays homage to classic Hollywood films and technique like The Shape of Water?\n\nI have no idea why the Academy would vote for Three Billboards.  Looked it up and it seems to be about how the story resolves that appeals to many voters.  SAG gave its top award to Three Billboards.  And it's reasonable they did that unless they gave it to The Post.  No other \"ensemble\" this year was going to be that charismatic.  \nBut that doesn't mean it's the best film.  \nIt is said Harvey Weinstein's Oscar campaigns relied heavily on sending screeners to every SAG member and targeting them whenever he had a film in the run.

The next movies were Darest Hour and Phantom Thread, each with six. This narrows down the potential winners to four for me. This would support a case for these films to be the two movies in the running. Judge demographics:\nThe judges are ostensibly white and male, which could be used to support the case that they will vote for a movie that show characters they can relate to. Increase in minority-representative winners:\nMoonlight, a movie about the life of a gay black man growing up, won in 2018, Birdman in 2014, and 12 years a Slave in 2013. This gives minority-representative films a better chance to win than even a decade ago. Genre Precedent:\nThere seems to be a larger variety of winners since the 2008 rules change.\nGenre and Current Events:\nThe case could be made that The Shape of Water has a higher chance given violent domestic news and the need for escapism. Scandal:\nThe Shape of Water is facing a lawsuit over plagiarism, but that is unlikely to affect this since it was only filed recently.. Popularity:\nIMDB has The Shape of Water and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri as the first and second most popular films respectively. Box Office:\nDunkirk made the most money in 2017, grossing at least $188 million. Word of Mouth:\nI have only heard Get Out talked about online or via word of mouth.

Before the push for diversity (#OscarSoWhite social media protest), a NY Times study showed that Oscar voters were 94% white, 77% male.  Members also represented major studios which were 97% male, 87% white.  New members are younger and many are very influential which might make a difference specially in times were things go \"viral\" and AMPA members have admitted to not having watched all of the films nominated.  Membership for 2017-2018 is 8,427.  \n774 new members were invited in 2017, 683 in 2016, 322 in 2015.  \nNew membership group is 39% female (298) but that only brought female representation from 27% to 28% in the total membership.\n30% of the new class are minorities (232) and that brings minority share to 11-13% of the total membership.     In terms of actual voting, all members vote for Best Picture but it's interesting to take a look at the Academy branches. The branch with the largest membership is the Actors Branch with 1,176; Directors 512; Executive 499; Producers 524, Public Relations 524, Visual Effects 480, Writers 422 and so on.   HOW HAVE THEY VOTED RECENTLY?\nSo, here is how some of the professional organizations representing those top branches voted in their own Awards in the last three years (2015-2016-2017 winners for each): Producers Guild -PGA Awards: Birdman, Big Short, LaLa Land, Shape of Water.\nDirectors Guild -DGA Awards: Birdman, Revenant, LaLa Land, Shape of Water. \nScreen Actors Guild - SAG Awards: Birdman, Spotlight, Hidden Figures, Three Billboards. \nScreenwriters Guild:  (Adapted) The Imitation Game, The Big Short, Arrival; (Original) The Grand Budapest Hotel, Spotlight, Moonlight. 2017 awards are on Feb. 11.   Foreign Press - Golden Globes (only 93 members): Boyhood/Grand Budapest Hotel; Revenant/The Martian; Moonlight/LaLa Land; 3 Billboards/Lady Bird.  And for comparison, the Oscars: Birdman, Spotlight, Moonlight and ??? WHO COMES OUT ON TOP?\n3 years is not nearly enough to see any big changes or trends but looking at how members have voted since big membership changes started to take place tells me there is a probability for this to be a year in which the favorite, SHAPE OF WATER, is not going to get the Oscar.   There are 9 pictures nominated.  Each one needed only 300 votes to make it to nominees list. Apparently the Academy increased the number from 5 to up to 10 in response to declining ratings, fear of becoming irrelevant, so there are films included that have very little chance to win and may be there to appeal to different audiences.  This means that we can say films like The Post, The Darkest Hour, Call Me By Your Name, have the lowest chance of winning (based on the numbers of nominations in other significant categories).  There's an article in Variety this week that talk about how, for 90 years, the Academy \"wanted to be a symbol of Hollywood -glamour, excitement and artistry-- but now the word \"Hollywood\" evokes questions about narrow thinking and scandalous behaviour\"  The Shape of Water is the safe bet, it received 13 nominations and has won most major awards (Dunkirk received 8 nominations, Three Billboards 7, Get Out 3, Lady Bird 3) but it's not a slam dunk.    At this point, I think there will be an upset for Best Picture and that films like Get Out and Three Billboards will win. Dunkirk is a masterpiece but only 7 films have won best picture  have received the top prize at the Oscars without a corresponding bid for either Original or Adapted Screenplay. Get Out is a darling with critics and it's a much better crafted film than Three Billboards (which to put it in the kindest terms possible, gets an edge from its artistic anarchy.  I think it's too messy to win but it's a very likeable story).  Will wait to see how the Screenwriters Guild votes on Sunday to review the forecast.

Couldn't Guillermo del Toro just avoid all those cliches like the lips in the monster? Do something a bit more lyrical?  I thought there was something substantially sublime to the film that I may have been completely missing until the gov agent yells \"F***, it's a god.\"  Was this monster/creature a metaphor for anything?  Soundtrack, design production, editing, it's all spectacular, especially for a $20 million budget, but it's so hard to believe the Academy will vote for this a year after it voted for something as elegant and poetic as Moonlight and with films like Dunkirk and Get Out in the running.  But this is the Academy that nominated Three Billboards instead of The Florida Project so there's a lot going on here.   Three Billboards is terrible.  It's a very likable story, but the script is mediocre, lacks any complexity or depth, it's a bunch of missed opportunities after another.  In terms of craft, this is not a good movie, folks. It's a mess.  Dunkirk, Get Out, Call Me By Your Name are all brilliant films in their own way but none kept the buzz.  Lady Bird has impeccable directing.  What a sad year for film lovers.
