Odinga may go back to the Supreme Court alleging that the required reforms haven't been carried out. http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-41572128 Kenya's Raila Odinga quits election re-run\n10 October 2017\nKenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga has pulled out of October's election re-run. Mr Odinga said his withdrawal would give the electoral commission enough time to introduce reforms that will help deliver a more credible election.\nThe Supreme Court annulled the result of the original 8 August poll, which saw Uhuru Kenyatta declared winner, after finding irregularities. But Mr Kenyatta says he is ready to proceed with the new vote as planned.\nThe country's electoral commission said Mr Kenyatta had won the August vote by a margin of 1.4 million votes - or 54% of the total, compared to Mr Odinga's 44%. Kenya's vice-president, William Ruto, has now called on the commission to declare Mr Kenyatta president as a result of Mr Odinga's announcement. The election re-run was due to take place on 26 October, but Mr Odinga said on Tuesday: \"We have come to the conclusion that there is no intention on the part of the IEBC [electoral commission] to undertake any changes to its operations and personnel... All indications are that the election scheduled for 26 October will be worse than the previous one.\" As a result, he said, \"considering the interests of the people of Kenya, the region and the world at large\" it was best that he withdrew from the race.\nMr Odinga's coalition party believes the election will have to be cancelled as a result of his withdrawal, allowing \"adequate time to undertake the reforms necessary to conduct an election that is in strict conformity with the constitution, the relevant laws and the constitution\". But Mr Kenyatta, speaking at a rally in the southern town of Voi, said: \"We have no problem going back to elections. We are sure we will get more votes than the last time.\"\nHe added: \"We are also telling him it is the people's right to choose their leader. It is their sovereign right to choose their leader of choice.\" Uncharted territory\nThe withdrawal could be a strategy for Raila Odinga to exit the political scene on his own terms. The annulment of President Uhuru Kenyatta's victory in the 8 August election was a much-needed political high for Mr Odinga.\nHe felt vindicated for challenging the election and pushed for changes to the electoral system as a condition for his participation in the re-run. The electoral commission has rejected the changes he demanded, largely because of contractual agreements with the companies providing key services for the election. With President Kenyatta's party having won a majority of MPs in both houses of parliament, it is likely that Mr Odinga was headed for another defeat and that would be too much for a man, who has been nicknamed the enigma.\nThe legal consequences of Mr Odinga's withdrawal are unclear. Constitutional lawyers disagree on the way forward and whether the 26 October election can still take place and if, despite his withdrawal, Mr Odinga will still be on the ballot. Although many Kenyans are jaded by the never-ending political drama, they will now have to belt-up for a drive further into unchartered territory.\nMr Odinga's opposition coalition - the National Super Alliance (NASA) - has previously made clear its participation in the election was contingent on reforms being made. But Kenya's Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) says it has made the necessary changes.

Dateline 10-6-2017 [Kenya's] ...election rerun, now scheduled for October 26, is in trouble. In August, President Uhuru Kenyatta was declared the winner in a presidential election. His main challenger, Raila Odinga, claimed the results had been altered electronically, but observers from the US, EU, and African Union declared the vote free and fair. Kenya\u2019s election commission certified it. Then Kenya's Supreme Court ruled that the election didn\u2019t conform to the constitution and had to be rerun. Kenyatta continues to attack the integrity of the judges who nullified his win, and his allies are working to strip the court of its authority to void future elections. Odinga has called for street demonstrations that have devolved into violence among protesters, counter-protestors, and police. We\u2019re still optimistic, but in a country with a history of large-scale deadly election violence, this is a story to watch. -- Free email subscription from Signal, EGMedia <signal@eurasiagroup.net> Fri, Oct 06, 2017 4:35 am"], [40039, "2017-10-06T13:50:33Z", [0.15, 0.85, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [31238, "2017-10-06T13:41:35Z", [0.32, 0.62, 0.04, 0.02], ""], [691, "2017-10-06T12:30:32Z", [0.32, 0.68, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [40593, "2017-10-05T17:29:03Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.99, 0.01], ""], [5018, "2017-10-05T04:29:08Z", [0.95, 0.0, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [15196, "2017-10-04T02:40:22Z", [0.4, 0.6, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [598, "2017-10-03T14:51:16Z", [0.15, 0.43, 0.06, 0.36], ""], [691, "2017-10-03T14:39:42Z", [0.24, 0.76, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [706, "2017-10-03T02:01:55Z", [0.45, 0.55, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [40491, "2017-10-02T20:44:38Z", [0.32, 0.47, 0.09, 0.12], ""], [16272, "2017-10-02T17:32:34Z", [0.45, 0.05, 0.45, 0.05], ""], [1333, "2017-10-02T14:45:06Z", [0.3, 0.45, 0.0, 0.25], ""], [691, "2017-10-02T11:39:17Z", [0.22, 0.78, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [19801, "2017-10-02T07:01:42Z", [0.55, 0.0, 0.45, 0.0], "I see a supreme court challenge either way."], [25245, "2017-10-01T04:20:11Z", [0.07, 0.72, 0.15, 0.06], "Finding it difficult to locate current news about the upcoming rerun election.
