With this, then you would have to look at whether it was the hardware or software of the autonomous car. GM must also listen to its audience; many of whom show large amounts of apprehension in placing themselves or loved ones in a car without a driver. Because of these reasons, the likelihood of GM launching an autonomous vehicle hauling service is unlikely in the time span of less than a year.  https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Car-industry-in-a-nutshell-GM-shrinks-while-13422522.php\nhttps://www.law.com/legaltechnews/2019/03/26/gm-request-for-fully-autonomous-cars-faces-legal-speed-bumps/?slreturn=20190226150806\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-gm-selfdriving-cruise-insight/gms-driverless-car-bet-faces-long-road-ahead-idUSKCN1MY0CK\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-14/americans-still-fear-self-driving-cars"], [13657, "2019-03-25T07:39:21Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [172, "2019-03-25T00:41:45Z", [0.05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.95], ""], [57797, "2019-03-22T13:54:33Z", [0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.75], "GM's petition to NHTSA is going forward with a public comment period, which will probably last 60 days [1].

Miles driven may also be important but it can mislead because some companies (Way, Uber) racked a lot of miles in Phoenix, which is an easier test bed than San Francisco [2]. This means that their cars were learning less than Cruise's cars, which are encountering all sorts of more challenging situations in San Francisco.   In terms of DPTM, Cruise is where Waymo was in 2015 (0.8) [3] This suggests that they have a lot of catching up to do. Though, it's worth pointing out that it took Waymo one year to lower that number to 0.2, where it essentially flatlined (in 2017, Waymo was at 0.18, no data for 2018 yet that I've seen) [3]. Admittedly, Waymo drove ~600k miles in 2016 (whereas Cruise drove just over 100k in 2017 so it's hard to see them driving 600k miles in 2018, but again, miles driven has its flaws as an indicator).  Counterargument - but isn't AV tech really far away from prime time? Sure, in a sense, but it's worth pointing out that Cruise's 0.8 number is two orders of magnitude better than most AV companies [3] with the exception of Nissan and Zoox (compared to those, Cruise is one order of magnitude better). So when folks talk about the challenges of AV technology we should keep in mind that Cruise is far ahead of the competition (with the exception of Waymo of course).  Conclusion: A >90% on \"No\" doesn't seem right. The criteria for this question are not insurmountable. We know that it has been done before (Waymo). Additionally, it's worth noting that Cruise doesn't have to reach Waymo's DPTM to launch a service. If it had a safety driver in every vehicle it wouldn't matter if the disengagements happen rarely or very rarely. Also, GM could pick a very easy city and launch its service in the suburbs. On top of that, it could choose to not operate during bad weather. Still, I am not reducing the chances of \"No\" to less than 80% for now as I am trying not to get swept up by optimism. After all, Cruise has a track record of missed deadlines and employees have raised concerns about the readiness of the technology (though it's important to define what we mean by readiness - again note the expansive criteria of the question).

[1] However, Cruise has recently been logging a only third of the miles driven reported by Waymo so it\u2019s still a ways behind [2]. An interesting question is where Cruise stands in terms of miles driven and miles per disengagement compared to where Waymo was when it launched its service.

Perhaps they do this as they realize that a well-meaning goal is actually less feasible than they thought. This is the thinking behind the \"No\" rationale. However, that is not what we are seeing.  This suggests that the posterior probability of a \"No\" should be lowered as we see GM stand by their plan.

From the website it looks like anyone can *apply* but that doesn\u2019t guarantee one can use the service [1] This article about Waymo says \u201cRides still won\u2019t be open to the general public\u201d [2] and this article quite clearly states a public launch is expected in the future [3]. If Waymo hasn\u2019t gotten there yet, GM will need more time as it\u2019s technology is not as advanced.

This suggests that the technological bar is not that high and it\u2019s more conceivable that GM will reach it. Regulatory barriers will affect vehicles without steering wheel at the federal level. But states might be happy to let GM start a service in their state as they race with each other to become development hubs for AVs."], [57797, "2018-12-27T17:43:24Z", [0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.9], "Technological and regulatory barriers make this very unlikely. Even Waymo\u2019s technology is very glitchy based on how the cars have been behaving [1]. GM has been running second behind Waymo in terms of miles traveled, so they are accumulating experience and I would guess they will launch a service at some point in the future. But I am guessing the technology won\u2019t be ready to guarantee a margin of error small enough to expose it to human customers. Any company trying to do this will want to launch only when it\u2019s confident that the tech is ready to prevent a backlash that could slow the whole thing down significantly.   I am not putting much weight on the fact that GM announced it. An announcement like that serves the purpose of telling the world that GM is aggressively working toward it, to signal to investors that GM wants to be part of the autonomous future and to scare off competitors. Its purpose is as a signal, less so as an announcement of genuine intentions.

Plus, American car companies are desperate for a win, and I could see GM throwing a lot of resources into a Pyrrhic victory of second-to-market. This is one I'll have to update a lot over the next year as new developments occur. The no-steering-wheels thing is a fun red herring, but seems only slightly more likely than a car without brakes.
