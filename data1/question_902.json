It is possible to make an argument that all Braun needed to do in the debate is not bomb completely. If that is the bar for success for him, then we safely can say he made it. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that Braun's PredictIt odds stayed strong after the debate.

Predictit is heavily favoring Braun: (https://www.predictit.org/Market/3005/Who-will-win-the-2018-Indiana-Republican-Senate-primary). On policy, Rokita is probably the favorite to win. He has symbolic proposals like making English the official language which should appeal to the Trump base. He won the last debate as I argued earlier.  Turnout will matter. I assume it will be relatively low due to it being an off year. Also, and this is a fallible indicator, I am seeing a lot of comments on reddit and facebook to the effect that voters don't like any of the three candidates. This is hinted at also by the high number of undecideds as of early April (https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2018/senate/in/indiana_senate_republican_primary-6523.html).  If turnout is low, all that will matter is intensity of support. Intensity is hard to judge. A look at the top tweets from the last month shows more support for Rokita from Trumpers with a lot of followers and a relatively high number of retweets. Another data point: Rokita has 4k followers vs. Braun with ~700. I couldn't extract anything useful out of Reddit.  Personalities: Braun's background and outsider status makes him a favorite. Braun's cardboard ad is a hit, but is it enough to make a voter go to the polls? Especially given how unimpressive he was in the last debate?  Partisanship: should favor Messer or Rokita.

Not sure how much it matters but in terms of rhetoric he wiped the floor with the other two. Landed punchlines well and delivered his policy messages to the conservative base. Messer appeared small time (interrupting the debate to 'break' an unrelated news; bringing up a private conversation with Braun), and generally seemed pathetic (e.g. obsequiously saying he will nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize). His repeated \"I am who I say I am\" messages made him less believable, not more. Braun shot himself in the foot. He only succeeded in making himself appear closer to Trump than the other two. He's got the same business background and outsider status. He didn't really convey any policy ideas or knowledge of the process of governance (I suppose Trump didn't have the latter but at least he had symbolic policy proposals, e.g. the wall). Braun couldn't stop repeating his one message that he is not a career politician. That probably matters to voters, but can it get a vacuous candidate elected? I am starting to be skeptical. Rokita called him out on having no \"substance\". Braun also lacked Trump's showmanship and bravado (which he lacked also at the previous debate), seeming ever so slightly unsure of himself (e.g. repeatedly looking down after finishing his statements as opposed to at the camera).  Also worth mentioning: Messer and Rokita (who had previously focused on attacking each other) laid into Braun repeatedly, which should help diffuse his rise. I had a look at Google Trends for each candidate's name and it seems like Braun is getting significantly more than the other two.

I ranked none of the above higher than all of these candidates, around a 50/50 shot because I believe the current Senator for Indiana, because of his incumbency advantage is more likely to win again but because Indiana can be a typically Republican state, he is also at risk for losing his seat as a democrat.

Joe Donnelly (D), including two sitting members of the U.S. House, Reps. Todd Rokita (R) and Luke Messer (R). This seat was rated Toss-up by three outlets as of January 24, 2018, and CNN listed this seat among 10 U.S. Senate seats it considered most likely to flip in 2018.[5][6] Primary elections for this seat will be held on May 8, 2018. The primaries will determine which Democratic candidate and which Republican candidate will advance to the November 6 general election.
