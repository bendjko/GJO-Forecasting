Strache has already pimped Hofer has a potential middleman between the US and Russia. However, the uncertainties that have already emerged regarding Trump\u2019s forthcoming stint in the Oval Office may convince the electorate to stick with the traditional parties and figures, rather than plumping to elect Europe\u2019s first far-right head of state since the Second World War. Pollsters have already become more cautious. No one has been too eager to predict what the outcome of the rerun will be, especially since Trump\u2019s win defied most of the forecasts that were made before the 8 November vote. Both Austrian candidates are currently hovering around the 50% mark.\nOn the back of measures taken by the Austrian government, immigration is no longer the hot topic it was before the summer and is not the catalyst it once was for the FP\u00d6. Nevertheless, integration will still play a significant role in people\u2019s election choice.\nhttp://www.eurasiareview.com/14112016-could-austrias-presidential-election-be-hit-by-trump-effect/\n_______________________\nCOMMENT:  Raising the chances for Van Der Bellen since the US elections left most EU appalled."], [20692, "2016-11-20T15:00:59Z", [0.4, 0.6, 0.0], ""], [14208, "2016-11-20T01:00:41Z", [0.8, 0.2, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2016-11-19T20:59:39Z", [0.56, 0.44, 0.0], ""], [691, "2016-11-19T12:32:00Z", [0.82, 0.18, 0.0], ""], [22706, "2016-11-19T04:58:48Z", [0.95, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [5001, "2016-11-19T01:20:44Z", [0.7, 0.3, 0.0], ""], [9755, "2016-11-19T00:52:10Z", [0.55, 0.45, 0.0], ""], [1262, "2016-11-18T19:43:52Z", [0.67, 0.33, 0.0], "Polls have consistently (1) shown Hofer ahead with the exception of the Nov 17th (see below.)\nPoll (Gallup/\u00d6sterreich)                    11/16:   Hofer ahead 52/48\nPoll (Unique Research/Heute/AT)   11/17:   Van der Bellen ahead 51/49\n1:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_presidential_election,_2016 Articles from CNN (2) and Financial Times (3) note a trend towards populism & the right as reflected by \"Brexit\" and the victory by Donald Trump in the recent US election.

Moreover, there is at least two months before the election, with a large number of voters who have not decided, and a significant contributing factor on what to vote for many would be emotional. This means that the result can go either way depending on the candidates' PR tactics and events that happen to take place  in the mean time (ranging from the plight of migrants to terrorist attacks), which will affect how many voters will be engaged to go to the ballot box in the first place and then also influence which candidate they will vote.

However, heading into the May vote polls showed him with around a 3.5% margin, and lost the vote count by almost 1%. In the May vote, the percentage of voters vs the population in each district showed a strong positive correlation with Hofer's vote margin.  I don't know much about Austria's district level demographics, so it's entirely possible that this is because the districts which favored Van der Bellen have more children and immigrants who are not eligible to vote, but I'm guessing that this is only a partial explanation, and that turnout was indeed lower in those districts.  Assuming that very few people will actually change their vote from the previous round, Van der Bellen has a larger pool of potential voters to turnout and improve on his vote totals. Finally, a rerun of Vienna's second district resulted in a strong showing for the Green party.  They gained mostly at the expense of the SPO, but it still seems to be an indication that in reruns, the Greens might have an advantage against the FPO.\nhttp://www.thelocal.at/20160919/green-party-wins-election-re-run-in-viennas-leopoldstadt With these considerations I think Van der Bellen has a decent edge despite the media narrative."], [28041, "2016-09-19T02:10:10Z", [0.55, 0.45, 0.0], ""], [241, "2016-09-18T17:41:26Z", [0.53, 0.47, 0.0], ""], [691, "2016-09-18T13:13:17Z", [0.57, 0.43, 0.0], ""], [28041, "2016-09-18T09:19:55Z", [0.57, 0.43, 0.0], ""], [28944, "2016-09-17T20:38:59Z", [0.55, 0.45, 0.0], ""], [691, "2016-09-17T18:10:28Z", [0.56, 0.44, 0.0], ""], [14777, "2016-09-17T15:11:01Z", [0.5, 0.5, 0.0], ""], [28972, "2016-09-17T05:50:16Z", [0.5, 0.5, 0.0], ""], [29017, "2016-09-16T20:22:23Z", [0.78, 0.22, 0.0], ""], [691, "2016-09-16T12:18:41Z", [0.56, 0.44, 0.0], ""], [11724, "2016-09-16T05:15:50Z", [0.3, 0.7, 0.0], ""], [691, "2016-09-15T15:26:42Z", [0.58, 0.42, 0.0], ""], [28982, "2016-09-15T11:58:18Z", [0.45, 0.55, 0.0], ""], [28979, "2016-09-15T11:21:15Z", [0.72, 0.28, 0.0], ""], [1262, "2016-09-14T17:54:28Z", [0.5, 0.5, 0.0], "Recent polls are variable and delays may work to Van der Bellen an advantage.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_presidential_election,_2016"], [28969, "2016-09-14T17:18:03Z", [0.7, 0.2, 0.1], ""], [691, "2016-09-14T15:24:22Z", [0.58, 0.42, 0.0], ""], [4042, "2016-09-14T10:51:31Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [20740, "2016-09-14T07:18:37Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [14777, "2016-09-13T23:34:46Z", [0.53, 0.47, 0.0], ""], [24, "2016-09-13T20:18:31Z", [0.65, 0.35, 0.0], "Continuing Farcical banana-republic style delays to the election might be expected to benefit Hofer, if he can successfully convince people that they are a conspiracy against him (and in reality, it's not inconceivable in part that they might be).

Van der Bellen got 48%.  Urban, educated voters continue to overwhelmingly back  Van der Bellen, while manual workers and rural voters support Hofer.   The matter of the 9 refugees accused of raping a German woman on new year's eve is having an effect on public opinion.  Hofer called for a ban on burqas this week, has advocated for blocking Turkey into the EU, and threatened to push for the country to leave the EU.  That is bound to get him a lot of attention and press but we need to look deeper to figure out if the conditions are there for it to hold and propel him.  So far, it seems so.   But we should also consider that such controversial issues get a lot of media attention and a lot of people talking and might contribute to giving an inflated impression of how people will vote.  This week, the country's foreign minister, Sebastian Kurz from the OVP party) called for an obligatory 1-euro jobs for refugees as part of the country's immigrant integration proposals.  He also said that the issue of the burqa needs to be discussed as a \"full body veil hinder integration\" He called the burqa \"not a religious symbol but a symbol for a counter society.\"  It will be interesting to see how the public reacts to this and to the integration proposals.  It could be a good indicator of how the election might lean.  Notably, 3 French cities have recently banned the burkini swimsuits saying they defy French laws of secularism.  France already has a ban on niqabs and burqas in public.  From what I could find on the web, Van der Bellen seems to be running a more organized campaign.  The recall election is supposed to leave no doubt of the legitimacy of the process but you can find many tweets and posts on social media sites from nationalists using the Austria case as confirmation that the US election is rigged.  Just an interesting observation on the trend in different countries.   If Austria votes for Hofer, it will be the first country in Europe with a far right government.  The Freedom Party was once described \"as a party of former Nazis for former Nazis.\u201d To see chilling tweets in support of Hofer that also say that Nazism isn't bad is what makes me forecast in favor of Van der Bellen winning.  But that rationale is also part of what made me forecast Brexit would not happen so I need to keep that in mind.

POLLS:\nGallup poll published in Austria on 8/2 showed Hofer at 52% vs 48% for Van der Bellen. NOTE:  \nThis election is the first since WWII where an Austrian president has not been backed by either the People's or the Social Democratic parties.  We should be watching if there is any difference in their support or endorsement of the candidates.  \n"], [10759, "2016-08-11T17:33:05Z", [0.45, 0.55, 0.0], ""], [4634, "2016-08-11T17:32:54Z", [0.45, 0.55, 0.0], ""], [25681, "2016-08-11T13:40:01Z", [0.97, 0.03, 0.0], ""], [27874, "2016-08-11T11:04:10Z", [0.45, 0.55, 0.0], ""], [19801, "2016-08-11T03:19:25Z", [0.52, 0.48, 0.0], "The poll published by the \u00d6sterreich paper on Sunday (31 July) showed the midpoint of the wide range of support for Hofer at 52% \u2014 one point higher than a poll in early July found \u2014 versus 48% for van der Bellen.\nhttps://www.euractiv.com/section/elections/news/right-wing-nationalist-set-to-win-rerun-austrian-presidential-race/"], [14761, "2016-08-10T22:26:45Z", [0.85, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [24282, "2016-08-10T22:09:20Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [28204, "2016-08-10T20:22:53Z", [0.47, 0.53, 0.0], "Alexander Van der Bellen narrowly won last time.
