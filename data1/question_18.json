The first round of negotiations took place in July 2013, barely 3.5 years before the deadline of the question. For comparison: CETA took 5 years and the TPP took 7 years to negotiate. Both are of comparable complexity and involve some of the same partners. TTIP is in fact the youngest of all negotiations listed as \"ongoing\" on this list (http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-734_en.htm). To me this indicates that even if TTIP were a completely de-politicized and average trade agreement, finalizing negotiations within 3.5 years would be extremely unlikely. It shouldn't come as a surprise therefore that as of April 2016, only four of the 25+ negotiation sectors were in an \"advanced stage of consolidation\" with five sectors still without even concrete proposals by the two parties (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_Trade_and_Investment_Partnership#Negotiation_progress). On the other hand, there is considerable institutional pressure to conclude the negotiations as soon as possible, so the probability of an all-out effort to finish the negotiations by the end of 2016 is not 0. It should also be noted that the negotiation teams work mostly independent of the politicians that are declaring TTIP dead nowadays. These are career bureaucrats who have a clear mandate to conduct negotiations along certain lines. If they can find common ground, they will. The politics impact primarily the question of ratification, not negotiation. The exception to this rule are questions that were obscure only a few years ago and are now subject to intense public scrutiny, like the investor protection measures (arbitration courts, etc). It is possible that the E.U. has changed its negotiation position on some of these issues with an eye on getting the treaty ratified, which will have complicated the negotiations. Based on these assumptions alone I would give \"yes\" a probability of 15%. Based on news that France has called for an end of the negotiations (which would undermine the mandate of the negotiators) I will lower this forecast to 5% and with the option to lower it further depending how this plays out over the coming weeks. The French position is likely a campaign play, not politics of conviction, but France is an important country in the E.U. and if the government has decided that the negotiations should go away at least for the duration of the presidential campaign, it will set the process back for at least six months."], [1034, "2016-09-02T06:25:48Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2016-09-01T18:53:56Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-09-01T18:17:57Z", [0.0], ""], [22243, "2016-09-01T14:30:37Z", [0.0], ""], [28631, "2016-09-01T14:06:18Z", [0.0], "too may elections on the horizon ....

They argue that by seeking convergence in regulation, TTIP is actually heading to the lowest levels of protection. There is also a widespread concern about plans for tribunals or courts where foreign investors would be able to sue a host country government if its policies breached the agreement and caused losses to the investor.\n. . . \n\"TTIP certainly has support among business groups on both sides. And the negotiators in the US and at the European Commission have pressed ahead, saying they have made progress. But they are well behind the original timetable . . . \nMr Obama has been consistently enthusiastic about the plan, [but] Hillary Clinton, has . . .  expressed reservations about some US trade agreements - especially the Transpacific Partnership (TPP). As Secretary of State, she supported the TPP negotiations but has said more recently that the result did not meet her standards. Her position probably reflects the growing concerns among American voters. \"The UK's decision to leave the European Union is also a setback for TTIP supporters. The UK has been one of the most supportive of the EU member countries, so TTIP is losing a significant part of its political driving force in Europe. \"In addition, the UK being outside Europe does potentially diminish the attractiveness of the plan to the US if it does not enhance American business access to Britain.\n. . . \n\"The political timetable in Europe is another obstacle to TTIP. Elections take place in both France and Germany over the next year. The French president, Francois Hollande, has also expressed opposition to the way the talks were progressing. \"There are usually few votes to be had from promoting trade liberalisation agreements even if candidates themselves do believe they are, on balance, beneficial. The benefits of trade liberalisation come in large part as lower prices and more choice for consumers, who do not necessarily realise the link with trade policy. \"So is Mr Gabriel right to say the talks have in effect failed? It's not his call - certainly not him alone. Trade negotiations are conducted by the European Commission on behalf of all the member states. They would want to be involved in any decision to bury TTIP. Mr Gabriel is also the leader of the junior partner in the coalition led by Angela Merkel. No such decision could bypass a leader of her importance.  \"The European Commission certainly does not agree with Mr Gabriel. The chief negotiator, Ignacio Garcia Bercero, responded: \"Remember what Mark Twain said.\" The author once said that reports of his death were \"greatly exaggerated\". A spokesman for Mrs Merkel said that it was right to continue negotiating, adding that often a breakthrough is only achieved \"in the final round\". \"That said, Mr Gabriel's remarks were a statement of his own assessment of where the talks are at. He was undoubtedly giving voice to real concerns across the continent and in the US. The TTIP negotiations continue for now - but under a darkening political cloud.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  I do not think that this article gives sufficient weight to the anti-trade agreement sentiment in the US.  Obama wants TTIP, but neither Clinton nor Trump, nor the members of their respective parties do.  Rhetoric aside, Obama is not going to push for something that may jeopardize Clinton's election chances and may never be ratified by Congress. \n"], [532, "2016-08-30T00:04:10Z", [0.05], ""], [3363, "2016-08-29T23:49:18Z", [0.11], ""], [12591, "2016-08-29T21:40:23Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2016-08-29T21:34:42Z", [0.0], ""], [12591, "2016-08-29T21:08:06Z", [0.1], ""], [28632, "2016-08-29T20:02:21Z", [0.02], ""], [691, "2016-08-29T19:47:18Z", [0.01], ""], [12879, "2016-08-29T18:58:59Z", [0.0], ""], [10039, "2016-08-29T18:51:16Z", [0.0], ""], [83, "2016-08-29T17:58:27Z", [0.82], "European Commission: ignore the German Econ minister, TTIP is still on track.\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-usa-ttip-europeancommission-idUSKCN114143?il=0 \"Backers of a sweeping U.S.-EU free trade deal see it bringing economic gains on both sides of the Atlantic.

There seems almost no chance that any of the current area trade deals involving the USA or the EU will be ratified anytime soon because in the public mind negotiated trade deals equate to giving jobs to foreigners and/or setting up arbitration systems that give away sovereignty. So the average voter is convinced that a trade deal is a \"bad thing\". (What the average voter wants is a gun boat sent to the foreign country to force them to give us a sweet deal, as we did things in the 19th Century).   \nHowever the question is will negotiations  be completed. Negotiations could be completed with an agreement that is likely to be ratified, Negotiations could be completed with an agreement that is unlikely to be ratified. Negotiations could be completed with no agreement at all.  With several big elections coming up in the next 15 months or so (US, French, German etc.) it is unknown which politicians would be in office when any TTIP agreement came up for ratification. Therefore completing negotiations in 2016 seems pointless because that would mean attempting to ratify an agreement that had been made under a different administration (certainly in the US and almost certainly in France). So it seems to me that it would be more productive to get as far with a TTIP agreement as possible this year, but leave the really difficult area for the next administration to struggle with.

With this is mind, and given that there is expected to be some pressure for a number of countries to leave the EU, the EU could, if they had some sort of deal in place, use such an agreement as a bargaining chip to protect various European markets, and hence retain the loyalties of certain EU legacy manufacturers, who would in turn lobby their governments to stay within the union. In short, Brexit aside, it's possibly a way to garner loyalty from other countries on the fence over leaving; hence some increased urgency to get it completed.

Matthias Fekl said a freeze in the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership talks was the \"most likely option\" without a change from the US. The French minister, who threatened to leave talks last year, said Europe was offering a lot with little in return.\nIt comes a day after Greenpeace leaked documents from the talks. The environmental group released 248 pages of classified documents, which it said showed how EU standards on public health risked being undermined by the major free-trade agreement.\nMr Fekl, the French minister for foreign trade, said a halt seemed to be the most likely option \"in view of the United States' state of mind today\".\n\"It is an agreement which, as it would be today, would be a bad deal,\" he said in a French radio interview. TTIP could \"unravel\" the international climate change deal agreed in Paris last year, he warned.\nFrance is also concerned TTIP does not offer safeguards for French agriculture or better access for its small and medium-sized companies in the US, he said.\n\"It cannot be agreed without France and even less so against France,\" he said. In September, Mr Fekl said France was considering all options including an outright termination of negotiations. The latest TTIP negotiating round took place last week and the European Commission says it hopes to achieve a deal later this year. That could avoid any political risk posed by the US presidential election in November.\nTTIP, which must be approved by all 28 EU countries, would harmonise regulations across a huge range of business sectors, potentially providing a boost to exporters on both sides of the Atlantic. The potential gains for the EU could be up to \u20ac119bn (\u00a394bn; $137bn) a year and \u20ac95bn for the US, according to European economic think tank, the Centre for Economic Policy Research.

The U.S. tabled texts for pharmaceuticals, medical devices and cosmetics, while the EU also tabled a text on pharmaceuticals which it plans to publish publicly after the round.  The two sides tackled phase-outs for the 97 percent of tariffs that they\u2019ve already committed to eliminate, trying to shorten the length of time those duties go to zero on lines that won\u2019t be phased out immediately.  \u201cIn almost every instance, we got more agreement,\u201d the USTR official said. \" . . . The U.S. cheese industry is likely going to have to agree to some of the EU\u2019s geographical indication demands for the U.S. meat industry to get better access to the European market under TTIP, Guida reports. \"At some point in the negotiations, we will have to make an offer on beef and pork and poultry, sensitive sectors in the EU,\" . . .  \"It will not be possible to make an offer or a generous offer unless we get GI [geographic indications] protection. That's the quid pro quo.\"  \" . . . the EU has asked for protection of some commercially important names, such as asiago, feta and parmesan. . . .  \"It's quite possible that some names, even if they're protected as GIs in Europe, would not be protected in the U.S. because the U.S. consumer regards them as a common name,\" he said. \"We're not dogmatic on this.\" \". . . European Agricultural Commissioner Phil Hogan underscored Thursday that the EU won't sign off on a trade deal with the United States that doesn't include recognition of its GIs for food. The Irish politician also said he's not going to rush to reach a TTIP agreement before Obama leaves office. There will be no sacrifice of the quality of European food and agricultural products \"for the sake of a deal with the U.S. or anyone else,\" Hogan said . . . GIs are needed as a sort of \"rural intellectual property\" and to ensure good prices for farmers' raw products, he said. \"We are certainly playing a tough card at the moment in terms of agriculture,\" he said. \"But they've made an assumption that we are going to cave\" on GIs and other protections for sensitive products. \"There will be no deal if that's the case.\" \" In New York, the two sides discussed financial services, focusing in particular on rules issues like the so-called \u201cprudential carveout\u201d that gives governments free reign to regulate as they see fit for the health of their financial systems. Don\u2019t hold your breath for market access talks in that sector anytime soon, as the two sides are still working out how and where to communicate about financial regulations. The U.S. continues to be adamant that forum should be the Financial Markets Regulatory Dialogue. \"Neither side has made offers on the automotive rule of origin, which will determine how much content has to be European or American in order to receive tariff benefits.  . . . the auto groups have not yet settled on a position on that issue. \"Top trade officials from the United States, the EU and 21 other countries negotiating the Trade in Services Agreement will meet in Paris on June 1 to take stock of the three-year-old talks.

Other issues stalling progress are the protection of European food names, common regulation on financial services, and the Commission\u2019s proposal to deal with investment disputes through an investor court that would include an appeal mechanism.

Regulatory cooperation . . .  harmonizing regulatory standards. . . Critics. . . . are concerned that such an alignment \u201cbears the risk of introducing U.S. regulatory standards that could lower our level of consumer protection,\u201d . . .  While EU legislation requires producers to prove that all substances in their products are safe before they get market approval, the U.S. does not have such a legal obligation. Critics say the U.S. applies exactly the opposite principle \u2014 products get approved unless it is proven that their ingredients can do harm. \"2. Investor-state arbitration.  One of the most controversial clauses would allow foreign investors to sue governments over regulations if they allegedly harm their investments. . . .The European Commission took this investor-state dispute settlement, or ISDS, off the negotiating table in January 2014 amid growing opposition in Europe. Then, the European Parliament demanded last July that ISDS be replaced \u201cwith a new system for resolving disputes between investors and states\u201d \u2014 otherwise, it would reject the whole deal when it is time for ratification. . . . there are signs that the U.S. is not very enthusiastic. . . .  \"3. Buy (not just) American . . . another potential deal breaker,\u201d . . . At issue is the opening of the world\u2019s two largest public contract markets to each other\u2019s companies. . . . . It will be a tough negotiation. \u201cWe have never expected that the Buy American Act would be abolished, especially not in an election year,\u201d . . .\u201cBut there are ways to make waivers and exceptions, and this is what we hope we can achieve.\u201d Another problem: Even if the U.S. federal government were to open its procurement market, this would not include contracts issued by the 50 U.S. states. Expanding the commitments to the state level \u201cis something where we are very much insisting [on],\u201d . .. . enlarging the negotiations to all U.S. states will be a very difficult step to undertake.\u201d \"4. Financial services.  Defining common standards for banks, traders and rating agencies is another priority of the EU. . . . the U.S. had been reluctant to approach financial services, arguing TTIP would not be the right format. . . . The only point on which both sides seem to agree so far is a \u201cprudential carve-out\u201d provision, which would allow governments to protect their financial systems during times of crisis. \"5. Protecting (European) food names.  These so-called geographical indications \u2013 for example, Parma ham or Roquefort cheese \u2013 are a top issue for the EU.  . .   so far Washington has shown little interest to give in. \n. . . \n\"With these five major points unsolved, and differences remaining in some others as well, the goal of concluding negotiations in 2016 seems ambitious \u2014 unless both sides manage to drastically speed up the negotiations. \u201cBy the end of this round, or shortly thereafter, we anticipate having specific agreement language under discussion in nearly all areas,\u201d said Trevor Kincaid, a spokesperson for the U.S. Trade Representative.

One such area is the concept of a \"Regulatory Cooperating Body.\" Another, no less contentious but far more prominent at the moment, is that of \"investment protection.\" It seems there are basically three positions here:\n1) The American position: Enhance the existing Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) framework which would provide maximum supra-sovereignty to foreign corporations via specialized commercial arbitration panels.\n2) The EU position: Replace the ISDS framework with a new Investment Court System (ICS). This position is identical to the American position in terms of providing maximum supra-sovereignty to foreign corporations, except it accomplishes this with a body of professional judges and provides states the right of appeal. The path from the EU position to desired eventual world investment court via the UN is more straightforward.\n3) The Juncker position. This would drop the idea of privileged investment protection for foreign corporations from the TTIP altogether, and place foreign corporations on the same standing as domestic corporations. This position broke an earlier block which allowed the TTIP to move forward, but was quickly abandoned once the negotiation process gained full steam. The concept of \"investment protection\" completely turns around the classic challenge of \"foreign investment country risk.\" Hitherto, if you chose to invest in the foreign country Peanutland, for example, your investment was subject to the whims of whatever the government of Peanutland might do. Anything from labor, process, or market regulation to outright confiscation of the entire investment was possible, without recourse (unless, of course, you could get your government to send in your military or the like). It seems investors desire to reduce these \"country risks\" to zero, which, from a portfolio perspective, would be a very nice boost to the return on capital (although they never fully bore the costs of sending in the military anyway). The pro argument is that \"investment protection\" would boost local economies because without such protection local economies would suffer, since potential investors would not invest in them. I consider the current flap to be no more than posturing around one of these three positions, and believe the issue will be resolved in this period.  That some positions may have been turned \"almost into a religion,\u201d however, obviously does add some uncertainty. (-5) [Edit: Positions #1 and #2 are favored heavily by the financial interests.

(The number of responses to an EC request for public comment exceeded 100,000; a crazy large number for something so obscure as a trade agreement.) Positions #1 and #2 are a backdoor grab of nation-state sovereignty (Corporation XYZ could sue Peanutland for banning ingredient ABC or restricting their product to adults over 21, or whatever.) The American financial lobby want the benefit without the overhead of the EU system. The EU financial lobby wants the benefit and the overhead because it fits into their vision of global regulation where they set the standards. An unsurprising outcome of positions #1 or #2 will be the change in domicile of ALL corporations to a jurisdiction outside where they do business to obtain the asymmetric benefits of being a foreign corporation. This upheaval would soon be followed with the disarray of local corporate law, contracting, and governance.

The two sides are trying to agree on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), a free trade deal that could deliver economic benefits of more than $100 billion for both economies, each searching for growth in the face of a Chinese economic slowdown. After more than two years of talks, both sides say a deal could be clinched this year before Barack Obama's term as U.S. president ends. Waiting for a new president with different objectives risks severely delaying any deal. \"We have to be approaching the endgame by the summer,\" EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom told a news conference at the end of talks between EU trade ministers. The partners have scheduled rounds of talks in February, April and July, with a view to having a consolidated text on almost all issues, leaving out the most sensitive topics such as agricultural quotas. In February, the partners will discuss the services sector, opening up public tenders and the European Union's proposal for a new court to settle disputes between investing companies and states, one of the most controversial parts of a would-be deal.\n~~~ COMMENT: There really isn't any \"new\" information in this article, but what interests me is that they're raising (?) expectations.

The endgame is only possible once the middle-game is over, the source said, pointing to the need for clear instructions from U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman and European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstroem by mid-2016 on how to focus on the most politically challenging issues. \"Endgame issues include geographical indications, certain agricultural tariffs and sensitivities on government procurement and financial services. The EU will continue to ask for \u201cexceptions in agriculture \u2014 beef, sugar, poultry and pork,\u201d Malmstroem said. The U.S. is expected to push back on carve-outs for agricultural products. Food safety issues also will be difficult to resolve. U.S. and EU officials will convene a high-level working group in early 2016 to discuss geographical indications. \"The next TTIP round is expected to take place the week of Feb. 22 in Brussels. Having credible initial offers on procurement would be an important advance in the talks, one source told Bloomberg BNA. The two sides also need to advance consolidated texts and proposals in the areas where they have not yet done so, sources told Bloomberg BNA. Discussions on regulatory cooperation in specific sectors \u2014 pharmaceuticals, medical devices, cosmetics, textiles, cars, information and communication technology, engineering, chemicals and pesticides\u2014will require clear and concrete ideas about what the outcome will be in specific sectors, the source said, commenting that this would be an important milestone to reach in the February talks. \" . . .  O'Sullivan was bullish on the possibility of reaching the middle-game in February, meaning that all issues are up for discussion and negotiation and there is an idea of what the final deal will look like.  \u201cThe objective is to get to the point where we have mapped the full scope of the agreement and all issues are on the table,\u201d he told Bloomberg BNA.  The endgame issue will be mapped out in less detail than areas where agreement can be reached sooner, O'Sullivan added. \"An important part of the middle-game discussions would be a credible offer from the U.S. side on government procurement, he said. \u201cWe expect to see an ambitious and meaningful offer as was discussed in the high-level working group when we were preparing these negotiations,\u201d O'Sullivan said. This means an offer that significantly improves European access to the U.S. procurement market, which O'Sullivan said is currently subject to restrictions at both the federal and subfederal level. \"Tim Bennett, director general and chief executive officer of the Transatlantic Business Council, told Bloomberg BNA that wrapping up TTIP was doable by late 2016. Waiting until 2017 to close negotiations could close the window of opportunity, he said.  Bennett expressed \u201cstrong skepticism\u201d that TTIP talks could be restarted once the current U.S. administration leaves, as 2017 will be focused on putting a new Cabinet in place. Also, Germany and France\u2014key TTIP countries\u2014will hold elections in 2017. For these reasons, it will be difficult to get back to the negotiating table in 2017, he said. The political difficulty increases on the European side as additional time elapses, he said. \"Congressional ratification of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) would \u201cclear the deck\u201d for earlier consideration of the TTIP, one source said. If the TPP is ratified by Congress in 2016, this would make it easier to get into the endgame of negotiations on TTIP, the source said. \"O'Sullivan said there is no direct relationship between the TTIP and the completed Trans-Pacific Partnership. If the TPP is approved in 2016, that \u201cwould certainly add momentum,\u201d O'Sullivan said. If the TPP takes longer, the EU will still push for the conclusion of TTIP negotiations with the Obama administration. The EU is currently negotiating with a number of TPP partners, he said, noting that countries are capable of negotiating multiple agreements simultaneously. \"In Bennett's view, congressional review and consideration of the TPP will not interfere with the TTIP negotiating process. Some of the TPP provisions could provide guidance in the TTIP, Bennett said, citing TPP provisions on intellectual property, state-owned enterprises and e-commerce.\n. .. .\n\"The European Commission has proposed reforming the investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) system by establishing an appeal mechanism and an international court. The ISDS proposal has been criticized in the U.S. by business associations and on both continents by nongovernmental organizations claiming that it does not go far enough. U.S. and EU negotiators will engage in substantive discussions on the new EU proposal in February. The ISDS mechanism allows companies to seek compensation from foreign governments on the basis of commitments in the trade agreement through international tribunals. \"The Commission proposal will cause pushback in some areas, such as the international court, but issues such as increased transparency, third-party participation and rules to avoid conflicts for arbitrators have already been worked through by the U.S. in its model bilateral investment treaty review, Bennett told Bloomberg BNA. ISDS provisions can be successfully negotiated, Bennett said, speculating that ISDS would not be an endgame issue. \"The U.S. will have to digest and react to the EU proposal, O'Sullivan said. Some parts will be harder to accept than others, but the public consultation process in Europe has resulted in a situation where the EU is now willing to negotiate an ISDS clause, he said. The TPP contains certain \u201cevolutions\u201d on the ISDS clause, he said. With constructive discussion on both sides, O'Sullivan voiced confidence that the parties could craft an ISDS clause that would be acceptable to both sides. An acceptable outcome on the ISDS issue will be a very important criterion when the TTIP is judged by constituencies in Europe and the European Parliament, O'Sullivan said. \"Building on the tariff offers, delving into the investment proposal, moving forward on regulatory cooperation and starting to build toward final agreement, and clarifying where Froman and Malmstroem need to step in and give guidance will be important mileposts for the next round, Bennett said. For the difficult political issues, the EU needs to get approval from the EU Council representing the 28 member states, Bennett said. That additional step is needed for approval on the EU side. \" . . .  One issue that should be addressed is harmonizing de minimis thresholds relating to the import of small, low-value consignments into the European Union. The EU de minimis is less than $200. \u201cIt's a tough issue that we've been trying to find a solution for,\u201d Laney said.  The pending Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 would raise the current $200 de minimis threshold in the U.S. to $800. \u201cWe are seeking a Customs de minimis that protects importers from the imposition of \u2018all' taxes and duties at the border, including [value added taxes (VAT)]. There have been proposals by some for a de minimis that provides no \u2018customs' taxes and duties; however, VAT would be applied,\u201d Laney told Bloomberg BNA. \"Another key issue relates to a single window for trade data, Laney said. While the U.S. is moving quickly, the EU has not progressed as fast. Laney said trying to ensure that the EU moves in that direction is critical. He acknowledged that it is unclear whether the TTIP would include specific text in this area. Better aligning the EU's Authorized Economic Operator (AEO) program with U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Customs and Trade Partnership would enhance the security capacity of both regions. Laney said the AEO program should be strengthened.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  This broadly lays out the issues and the process.  This will give me some \"benchmarks\" to measure progress by.

The endgame is only possible once the middle-game is over, the source said, pointing to the need for clear instructions from U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman and European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstroem by mid-2016 on how to focus on the most politically challenging issues.\n[...]\nThe next TTIP round is expected to take place the week of Feb. 22 in Brussels.\n[...]\nAn important part of the middle-game discussions would be a credible offer from the U.S. side on government procurement, he said. \u201cWe expect to see an ambitious and meaningful offer as was discussed in the high-level working group when we were preparing these negotiations,\u201d O'Sullivan said. This means an offer that significantly improves European access to the U.S. procurement market, which O'Sullivan said is currently subject to restrictions at both the federal and subfederal level.\n[...]\nIn Bennett's view, congressional review and consideration of the TPP will not interfere with the TTIP negotiating process.

That should make the German project a.k.a. EU eager to open new export opportunities across the pond (in addition to a Mercosur-EU FTA now that Argentina is no longer obstructing). Obama wants it before his term is out, and the Republican US congress is FTA friendly. \nBut I do wonder how the EU public will react if the FTA's gain a reputation for only benefiting large corporations and hurting domestic workers. Even though there's not as much risk for outsourcing EU jobs with a FTA with US as would be with Asian economies for instance with super low wages, the public view could coalesce around such a perspective and make the TTIP about as attractive in the EU as NSA spying and Google etc not paying fair taxes in EU.

John Brook, the European regional director of the U.S. Meat Export Federation . .  . [said]  that he's not optimistic about the prospects for a TTIP deal, largely because of opposition from the European opposition agriculture sector. \"QUOTE OF NOTE: \"Try and find me someone here in agriculture, first of all, who wants TTIP and believes in it,\" Brook told Europe Brief. \"The resistance to TTIP in European agriculture sector is huge. It's certainly protectionist.\" 'THE BACKDROP: European concerns about the U.S. farm and food industry's standards, including the use of GMOs, hormone-fed cattle and chlorine-washed poultry, are well-documented and remain a point of contention for U.S. meat exporters. \"I've never met a European who has been to the U.S. and said they didn't dare eat anything because of the hormones,\" Brook maintains. \"They go to the steakhouse and say it was fantastic.\" \" You talk to anyone in the poultry sector, they're still going to say U.S. poultry is done more cheaply than European poultry because of access to GMO feed,\" says Brook. \"The Europeans will also say that [Americans] don't have the same hygiene standards because you rinse chicken in chlorine, and we don't permit that. We do permit people to go into public swimming pools where there is chlorine, but we don't permit the chickens to go into swimming pools.\" \"BY THE NUMBERS: EU farm interests worry that TTIP could bring down the mix of tariff barriers, quotas and sanitary regulations that limit imports of U.S. beef to Europe. A longstanding ban on hormone-fed beef imports imposed by the European Union means that U.S. beef being shipped to the European Union has to be certified as hormone-free, and is produced specifically for the European Union in a non-hormone treated cattle program. The European Union also has a 48,000-ton quota for imported meat allowed to enter the continent at zero percent tariff. Right now, the United States' share of that quota is 40 percent, while Australia and Uruguay control the other 60 percent. In total, the restrictions mean that the U.S. exports a smaller amount of beef to Europe than it might otherwise send. The United States currently exports about 17,000 tons or $250 million worth of beef a year to the European Union per year, says Brook. \"ONE OUTLIER: BIG YOGURT. Brooks notes that the European dairy industry has been one of the few supporters of TTIP in the EU agriculture sector. Brook says that's because of the growing market for high-end dairy products like Greek yogurt. \"THE BOTTOM LINE: It's a catch-22 of sorts: Europeans are reluctant to include agriculture in the TTIP deal, but Brook's bosses in Washington won't do the deal without it. \"The United States says they won't do it without agriculture. Those are the people I work for,\" said Brook. \"So even if the Agriculture Committee [in the Senate] is three percent of the population, they still say they can have a majority that would block the ratification of a TTIP if it doesn't include agriculture.\" \"VILSACK'S TAKE: That's essentially what Vilsack had to say earlier this week, when he noted that GMOs, beef and U.S. opposition to EU origin protection designations were key sticking points. \"The agricultural interests in the United States, by themselves, are not politically powerful enough to get an agreement passed, but they are certainly powerful enough to stop agreement that's been negotiated,\" Vilsack said: http://reut.rs/1XJV8u3 \". . .  U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman has made it clear that the U.S. government isn't keen on working out a separate free trade agreement with the U.K. if the country were to leave the European Union. . . . \"The U.S. and the European Union hope to complete the TTIP deal before President Barack Obama leaves office in 14 months, joining together the world's two largest economies, covering more than $35 trillion in economic output, or roughly 46 percent of the world total. But one looming complication of the deal is that many Britons want out of their four-decade-old membership in the EU ... They want the country to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of other Europeans crossing the English Channel to find work and believe the U.K. could do better striking trade deals on its own.\" http://politico.pro/1NJ4VAZ\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  I'd be forecasting 0 except that \"neutralizing\" a 0 forecast is nigh impossible should I later decide I was wrong."], [73, "2015-12-03T18:47:28Z", [0.86], ""], [691, "2015-12-03T18:15:54Z", [0.13], ""], [498, "2015-12-03T01:05:15Z", [0.2], ""], [691, "2015-12-02T20:57:13Z", [0.13], ""], [368, "2015-12-02T20:11:59Z", [0.01], ""], [12311, "2015-12-02T13:25:49Z", [0.8], ""], [498, "2015-12-02T04:06:23Z", [0.1], "Open letter from European commission spokesperson re: TTIP\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/01/the-european-commission-consults-all-stakeholders-on-ttip-not-just-business Although it will be presented as a fait accompli, we are urged to believe that the \"TTIP is a democratic process, not some kind of conspiracy with big business in dark recesses.\" It might be a good time to consult the heralded Oxford dictionary for the definition of fait accompli, viz., \"A thing that has already happened or been decided before those affected hear about it, leaving them with no option but to accept.\" Seems appropriate, and very close. I'd say that there's also always an option to reject as well, but this is usually made difficult based on so-called practicalities.

It looks possible that the Americans will conclude TPP (the Trans-Pacific Partnership) with Asia but I haven't yet seen a clear priority commitment to conclude TTIP during Obama's presidency. . . . the former Prime Minister of Portugal particularly emphasised a lack of prioritising of TTIP from the US side of the negotiating table, and expressed concerns over the agreement's viability if not concluded during Obama's fast-expiring presidency. \u201cI think time is running out,\u201d says Barroso. \u201cI'm a big supporter of TTIP. I had the privilege of launching formal negotiations together with President Obama in the margins of a G8 meeting. And what I see is that the American administration says it is committed, as does the European administration, but the TPP for the US has pushed TTIP into a second level of priority. \u201cIn Europe there has been some progress. There was a vote in favour, in principle, in the parliament. But looking at negotiations, I see there's still a lot to do and that worries me: if you don't conclude it during the mandate of President Obama then you'll have to wait for another administration and that could postpone it too long. \u201cIt's possible [TTIP will still be concluded], the political will is there, but there isn't a sufficient level of urgency. Obama is in favour but he's got a lot on his plate: Iran, Cuba, TPP and so on. I just hope that, in the countdown to his presidency, that TTIP is not sacrificed because of those other priorities.\u201d\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  This man's comments express how it looks to me:  not promising at all for TTIP.

As regards France, its influence in EU decision making has been declining in recent years and the remarks of the French State Secretary for Foreign Trade are to be weighed in the context of the next French regional elections in December 2015. The French government and socialist party are really down in the polls and have to redeem themselves in the eye of the French public opinion.
