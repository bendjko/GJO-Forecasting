My rationale: 1)  only 5 weeks remaining, and up to now, seems like there has been very little to no serious discussion of a no-fly-zone amongst actual decision-makers (and key among them Obama and Hollande have made no supporting statements post-Paris attacks, and in fact Obama has come out opposed.  Aides reiterated today no change in strategy). 2)  Although obviously you do not want to allow Russia to infringe on an ally's airspace, if I were Obama, the last thing I would want to do is seek to escalate a stand-off with Russia quickly.  Russian soldiers may have died here, this could get serious in a hurry.   3)  The more you focus on the aspects of it that are Russia v. Turkey, less you focus on ISIS.  People at home in all these NATO countries want to see some serious action on that front, not a cold-war style stand-off with Russia.  If NATO declares a no fly zone in Syria along turkish border, what do you think Russia will do?  Double down in its support of Assad regime, put more troops in, etc.  It would calcify situation, whereas they clearly are still thinking there may be a way to slowly pry Assad from power with political pressure over time  (see article below, as well as other public quotes from the NATO leaders).  Also, if they declare a no-fly-zone and Russia violates it, what are they going to do, shoot them down?  Russia has unequivocally stated they are opposed and it violates Syrian nat'l sovereignty.  If you declare it and then let them violate it, you look weak, but if you shoot them down, then you have even more directly set up a fight over Syrian sovereignty between Assad/Russia/Iran vs. Nato/rebels. 4)  Finally, if they were planning to make a move on no fly zone front, I think they would have announced it at Obama/Hollande meetings today (or at least hinted at the possibility to test the waters).  In what would be potentially a standoff with Russia, you would want to be transparent and deliberate in your actions.  Instead, you see Obama aides telling the press no change in strategy re: no fly zone:  http://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-obama-hollande-isis-20151124-story.html From LA Times: \"The loss of the Russian plane also underscores Obama's concerns about instituting a so-called no-fly zone in northern Syria, which some presidential candidates have called for in criticizing Obama's strategy against Islamic State.  Going into Obama\u2019s meeting with Hollande, aides had signaled that the president was not considering a dramatic change of course. \u201cThere is a comprehensive strategy that is being implemented by the United States and the 64 other members of our coalition,\" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Monday. Whether Turkey\u2019s action will alter Obama\u2019s course remains an open question.  Obama has said he would support military cooperation with Moscow if it focuses on defeating the Islamic State rather than on protecting Assad -- a message he said he personally delivered to Russian President Vladimir Putin last week in Turkey during the Group of 20 economic summit. The White House does have an interest in trying to convince the Russians of its view that the only solution to peace in Syria includes a political transition away from Assad. \""], [506, "2015-11-24T18:07:50Z", [0.8], ""], [73, "2015-11-24T17:52:12Z", [0.68], ""], [484, "2015-11-24T17:27:08Z", [0.75], "Hollande's comments sound close to supporting."], [136, "2015-11-24T17:20:58Z", [0.6], ""], [484, "2015-11-24T16:39:52Z", [0.75], "Might be a feasible way to de-escalate and de-conflict warplane confusion."], [506, "2015-11-24T15:38:30Z", [0.65], ""], [77, "2015-11-24T14:48:36Z", [0.9], ""], [77, "2015-11-24T14:43:18Z", [0.5], ""], [11057, "2015-11-24T14:38:35Z", [0.11], ""], [77, "2015-11-24T14:31:50Z", [0.15], ""], [2965, "2015-11-24T14:05:41Z", [0.66], "as explained in earlier comments and forecasts one day  Turkey announces Erdogan visiti Putin, next day Turk air force shoot down Sukhoi near boudary and reports near crash report carpet bomng of non- ISIS opposition areas next to Turkey.\nits not dart throwing.

The idea is reckless and irresponsible for the following reasons: \"The areas are controlled by armed opposition groups, predominately Jabhat al Nusra (Al Qaeda). Very few civilians remain in the areas proposed for \u201cno fly zone\u201d in Syria. Most have fled to areas under Syrian government control, especially around Latakia and Tartous.

(There are already 4 million Syrian refugees in foreign countries, mainly Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.) Second, a sanctuary where Syrian rebels could train and from which they could conduct operations against the Assad regime or the Islamic State could strengthen Syrian opposition forces in the conflict.

Given the high costs of such a confrontation, it seems unlikely that the U.S. or its coalition partners will pursue a no-fly zone.   2) The U.S. and its coalition partners have been discussing the imposition of a no-fly zone for almost four years now, yet no action has been taken. As far as I can tell, the calculus that has led the coalition to sit on the sidelines for the past couple years hasn't changed. 3) The legal case for imposing a no-fly zone is shaky, at best. Imposing a no-fly zone would clearly violate Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, so the coalition would either have to secure the approval of the Security Council or argue that it was being done is self-defence. Russia's Security Council veto pretty much eliminates the first option.

However, unclassified U.S. military documents have repeatedly asserted that Russia is the world's most-capable militaristic and geopolitical force, after the United States (see DCDC Global Strategic Trends Programme 2007 - 2036).  Nearly every military commander is aware that aggressions against Russia would be long, difficult, and costly.  Additionally, the U.S. is war-weary from our wars in the Middle East, and U.S. citizens almost certainly do not have the resolve for their country and military to engage in such a war as a war with Russia would entail, as the war would have to be fully-protracted, fully-engaged, using the entire force at the militaries disposal, in order to win. However, despite near-universal misgivings of engaging in war with Russia, the U.S. geopolitical strategy is unusually anti-Russian/anti-Soviet.  Even during periods of peace and alliance with the region, American geopolitical interests have primarily been to ensure that Russia/Soviet Union's geopolitical strength does not eclipse the United States' (for example, one of the supporting reasons why the Hiroshima and Nagasaki A-bombs were dropped was as a demonstration to the Russia, and to solidify to Russia, and the world, that America was the sole world-power emerging from WWII).  Therefore, it is not wholly unthinkable that, (despite the danger in starting a war with Russia, and, despite that war necessarily being long, difficult, and costly), America could still establish a no-fly zone in Syria, if it thought that doing so was of considerable value to U.S. geopolitical interests.  Such a no-fly zone would not only have the benefit of curtailing a Russian hegemony of force in the region, but would also give cover to Western assets on the ground in Syria (the PKK, FSA), and establish a safe-haven for refugees, something that is much-needed as Syrian refugees flood neighboring (and Western-allied) Middle Eastern and European countries. All in all, a no-fly zone in Syria by the end of the year seems extremely unlikely.  However, the chance for the U.S. to realize the dual geopolitical rewards of protecting anti-Assad fighters on the ground in Syria, as well as preventing Russian hegemony over that area, may prove to be too tempting for the U.S. to turn down.  It's difficult, though not impossible, to see how a U.S. or coalition-imposed no-fly zone in Syria could come to fruition within the time-span of the next ~10-weeks."], [7586, "2015-10-25T17:52:36Z", [0.0], "They're not that crazy."], [7493, "2015-10-25T17:51:40Z", [0.0], "There will be no areas that the United States will \"claim\" within this year to necessitate a no fly zone"], [7574, "2015-10-25T17:51:05Z", [0.7], "Yes - but it may not result in a productive outcome"], [7795, "2015-10-25T17:49:51Z", [0.05], ""], [7282, "2015-10-25T17:49:50Z", [0.05], "complicate the conflict leading into the primaries, and it would potentially create conflicts between Russia, and the U.S., or an ally.\n"], [7229, "2015-10-25T17:49:45Z", [0.05], "No. The \"leading from behind\" doctrine followed by this administration will be shared by the coalition on this particular issue.
