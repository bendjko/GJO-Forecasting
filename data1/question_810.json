The outliers are September and October 2017, which saw huge numbers of reports for GM Cruiser. However, you can see that this slows down again for the rest of the year. For the first half of 2016, the accident rate was at about 1.25/mo and the first half of 2017 saw about 1.5/mo. These trends seem to actually put the base rate at just about 10, which hilariously is right on the edge of the prediction bin. Fewer than 10:\nGoogle/Waymo was a big driver (no pun intended) of 2016, but tech news seems to indicate that they've pulled out of California and into Arizona for testing. I haven't checked, but I wonder if it has anything to do with differences in state regulations for AV accident reporting...\n[1] https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/7/16615290/waymo-self-driving-safety-driver-chandler-autonomous There's > 40 companies licensed to test AV in California, but only Google and GM are currently showing major signs of activity, and as stated above, Google is probably out. GM was the sole cause of the Sept./Oct. outliers, and they suffered some pretty bad press because of it. It looks like they started lying low and/or being more careful because there's only two from them for the rest of the year. This could be a fiscal year thing - I can imagine someone from the top axing testing until 2018 to keep the bar charts shown in the board room meetings from getting out of control. 10 to 19, inclusive:\nWhich brings us to the next interval. GM, for better or worse, is probably staying in California because they plan to launch a taxi service by 2019 in San Francisco [2]. Their fleet more than doubled last year to about 100 and now they have a pretty big motivation to test a lot more [3]. Now that it's 2018, they get a fiscal year clean slate, so those Sept./Oct. outliers may not be outliers in the future.\n[2] https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/30/16720776/gm-cruise-self-driving-taxi-launch-2019\n[3] http://fortune.com/2017/10/04/gm-self-driving-car-california/ 20 to 29, inclusive:\nThe above would be the total estimate IF I could assume that it'd only be GM doing testing in California, but I have to account for the possibility that another player might try to break into the field and/or GM going nuts with their testing. Another player is very unlikely - GM has deep pockets and California's strict reporting guidelines probably spook most companies, not to mention that historically there are only one or two accident reports from a company that is not Google or GM. If GM wants to set up taxis in SF, it needs to run more tests, and mileage is highly correlated with accidents for AVs (see the linked paper). On the other hand, these accident reports are very closely monitored by the press, so any spike in accidents will likely result in a decrease in testing by order of head office to modulate the numbers.

In fact, it's clear that the number of accidents depends on whether there are companies testing AVs in California and where they are testing the AVs. Google/Waymo apparently mostly left CA after H1, GM/Cruise started moved in and added more testing. Also GM/Cruise started testing in SF where vehicle density is higher, streets are narrower and fender benders more likely. If GM/Cruise continues testing in SF, we can expect the same number of accidents as in H2 2017. If they stop testing in SF, the number of accidents will drop to H1 numbers or lower. If other companies start testing (in SF especially), the number of accidents will rise. It is worthwhile to check what GM/Cruise testing plans for H1/2018 are and if other companies are gonna start testing in CA in H1/2018. I have not done that. Note that the number of accidents does not depend on how good AVs operate. Pretty much all accidents are fender benders caused by other (human-driven) vehicles that AVs CANNOT AVOID. I.e. side swipes, tail hits, etc. So the prediction does not depend on how good AVs are (unless some company totally unprepared for AV tests starts testing AVs), but depend principally on the number of AVs tested and location of tests (SF == more accidents, non-SF == less)."], [11742, "2017-12-09T16:53:14Z", [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.3, 0.1], ""], [84, "2017-12-09T14:49:04Z", [0.05, 0.48, 0.45, 0.02, 0.0], "On the first link provided there are 26 so far for the year 2017.
