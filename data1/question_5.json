The front-runner to succeed Boehner is McCarthy, who has expressed opposition to ExIm.   Opposition to McCarthy seems to be coming from the right, which is opposed to ExIm. However, the ExIm has strong support from Democrats, and would also have support from the business community and establishment GOP. The right wing was unsuccessful in shutting down the government over Planned Parenthood. Non-reauthorization of the ExIm bank has potentially severe economic consequences, and Republicans would not want to be cast as job-destroyers in an election year.

The push to revive the bank comes amid the jostling to replace Boehner of Ohio, who announced on Sept. 25 that he would leave Congress at the end of October. McCarthy is the leading candidate to replace him. Republicans plan a leadership vote for Oct. 8. From <http://www.heraldnet.com/article/20151002/NEWS02/151009816>  Discharge petitions have rarely worked in the past, mostly because they have centered on divisive, partisan issue like immigration that have prevented them from reaching the 218 mark.\nBut anxiety about job losses is a bipartisan issue and Pelosi senses that the stars are aligned for Fincher\u2019s petition to meet the 218-signature threshold and hold a successful vote on the bill, possibly before Boehner leaves Congress on October 30. From <http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/01/Can-GOP-Bypass-Its-Right-Wing-Revive-Ex-Im-Bank>  He said that the impression of support for McCarthy among the Republican caucus is being manufactured by party elites and doesn\u2019t reflect the real feeling of the majority of members.\n\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to many members on the hill who aren\u2019t for McCarthy,\u201d Ward said. \u201cHe\u2019s absolutely not who we need as speaker of the house, or third in line for the presidency for that matter.\u201d\nWard said that his group will start circulating petitions, which will then be presented to members of Congress following a Capitol Hill press conference that he expects to schedule next Wednesday, the day before the leadership vote.\nHe said the Fire McCarthy movement isn\u2019t backing any particular candidate at this point, but said that might change. \u201cWe\u2019d like to get behind any member of congress who will reform leadership and give power back to the entire 435 members of Congress.\u201d From <http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/01/McCarthy-Isn-t-Speaker-Yet-Some-Conservatives-Want-Fire-Him-Already>  Mr. McCarthy, who in 2012 supported reauthorizing the bank, came out in opposition last year when he successfully campaigned for his current leadership post. Mr. McCarthy strongly discourages lawmakers from participating in any effort to force a vote on the bill, a spokesman said. \nWhen asked on Thursday if the House would vote on reauthorizing the bank, Mr. McCarthy said only that there was \u201cno action scheduled\u201d on it.\nMany believe prospects for Ex-Im Bank\u2019s revival would further dim if he becomes the next House speaker, as is widely expected. \u201cWe can\u2019t expect this to come forward under him, so those of us who support it\u2014this is a move we have to make,\u201d Mr. Kinzinger said.
