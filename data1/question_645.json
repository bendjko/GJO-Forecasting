In a recent report analyzing Russian view of the international order, we outline Russia\u2019s core foreign-policy interests, including defense of the country and regime; influence in the \u201cnear abroad,\u201d Russia\u2019s term for its immediate neighborhood; and, relatedly, a vision of itself as a great power. According to Russian analysts, the near abroad includes all of the republics of former Soviet Union except the Baltic states. They see the Baltic states as foreign, and fully incorporated into NATO. With the exception of a few hardline \u201cEurasianists\u201d such as Aleksandr Dugin, with little direct influence on policymaking, there is little interest in occupying these territories. Russia does maintain some interest in continuing a relationship with the Russian speakers, including through its \u201ccompatriots policy,\u201d but this is a low priority. Absent a threat to its security, it is hard to see how these core interests would lead Russia to want to attack the Baltic states. Indeed, in reviewing the Russian strategic literature, another recent RAND report found \u201cno serious discussion of the strategic value of retaking part or all of the Baltic States, either for their intrinsic value or as a way of weakening NATO.\u201d\nThe Russian discourse on Ukraine highlights the limited importance of the Baltics for Russian foreign policy. Russians appear to view Ukraine as an extension of Russia: by some accounts as \u201clittle Russia,\u201d or as Putin explained to President Bush in 2008, \u201cnot even a real country,\u201d given the close relationship between Russia and parts of Ukraine. By contrast, the Baltic states are where movies staged in the West were filmed during the Soviet Union. Ukraine is front and center in the major Russian strategic documents, such as the Foreign Policy Concept or National Security Strategy, but the Baltic states do not appear. Russian media and other public discourse see a coordinated and intentional Western effort to undermine Russia\u2019s position in Ukraine. By contrast, they cannot imagine that Western concerns about Russian military action in the Baltics are legitimate, and tend to see them either as manipulation by the Baltic states or the U.S. military-industrial complex. Russia might not broadcast a plan to invade the Baltics, but its public description of the importance of Baltics is inconsistent with Russia launching an offensive military operation against them. Russia does see NATO as a threat to its security and influence in its region, but this concern stems from NATO\u2019s movement east, not from the defensive guarantees of the alliance. When Russian defense officials highlight the threat of NATO, they discuss military infrastructure close to Russia, Western support for \u201ccolor revolutions\u201d (in which existing leadership of countries are overthrown in favor of democratically elected officials), and NATO\u2019s support for the eventual integration of former Soviet republics such as Georgia and Ukraine. By one analyst\u2019s account, the collapse of NATO would be highly destabilizing, and pose a greater threat to Russia\u2019s security. Without NATO, there could be substantial European rearmament, and even German pursuit of nuclear weapons.\"\n"], [691, "2017-11-12T21:36:25Z", [0.0], ""], [29646, "2017-11-12T19:05:43Z", [0.0], ""], [41360, "2017-11-12T17:22:59Z", [0.01], ""], [23704, "2017-11-12T15:43:48Z", [0.02], ""], [38334, "2017-11-12T14:05:02Z", [0.02], ""], [1034, "2017-11-12T05:25:21Z", [0.0], ""], [29646, "2017-11-12T00:06:15Z", [0.0], ""], [41270, "2017-11-11T21:40:37Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2017-11-11T19:53:37Z", [0.0], ""], [2965, "2017-11-11T13:26:11Z", [0.0], ""], [10745, "2017-11-11T12:29:29Z", [0.0], ""], [29646, "2017-11-11T01:22:56Z", [0.0], ""], [41289, "2017-11-10T22:59:04Z", [0.02], ""], [15371, "2017-11-10T21:54:37Z", [0.1], ""], [41160, "2017-11-10T20:16:32Z", [0.25], ""], [41262, "2017-11-10T19:59:22Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-11-10T18:12:03Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-11-10T16:42:25Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-11-10T15:23:26Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-11-10T01:29:06Z", [0.0], ""], [29646, "2017-11-09T21:43:36Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-11-09T16:47:15Z", [0.0], ""], [37912, "2017-11-09T12:23:45Z", [0.03], "It's too soon and the demands from ethnic Russians in those countries aren't strong enough to provide cover."], [19930, "2017-11-09T04:44:06Z", [0.01], "NATO membership of these countries makes military activity a thick red line to cross.

But the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, and their Nordic neighbors, have increasingly become a testing ground.\nLithuania has said that it has faced a constant stream of cyberattacks against its government departments since 2014, while Russian jets routinely violate national airspace in the Baltic. Estonia said that Russia abducted one of its intelligence officers in September 2014 in a high-profile incident involving smoke grenades at a customs post near the border; he was later released in a prisoner swap. Finland has also weathered a flood of false information about the war in Ukraine, fake stories about the abuse of ethnic Russians in Finland, and real threats from Russian President Vladimir Putin that Moscow will be forced to take countermeasures if the country joins NATO.\nThe traditional response has been to field tanks and train troops; earlier this year, NATO deployed four battalion-sized battle groups to Poland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania to deter the Russian military. But amid the heightened tensions, officials across the region say that they are moving fast to counter and adapt to Russia\u2019s new generation of war capabilities in an emerging defense doctrine that increasingly relies on investing in brainpower as much as it does firepower.\n\u201cWhat we need to change is our attitude and see that this isn\u2019t just about Russia. It\u2019s about us,\u201d Janis Garisons, the state secretary at Latvia\u2019s Ministry of Defense, told Foreign Policy in an interview. \u201cRussia is exploiting our weaknesses.\u201d\nThose weaknesses include the usual suspects, from pregnable electricity grids to porous cyber defenses. But they also include society\u2019s vulnerability to information warfare. Russian-directed misinformation uses fake stories, doctored photos, and propaganda to confuse and distract everyday citizens and policymakers alike. In Latvia, these stories have centered around undermining the country\u2019s membership in the European Union and NATO, but they also increasingly look to create and amplify divisions in society, whether on wedge issues like LGBT rights or discrimination toward Latvia\u2019s ethnic Russian population.\n\u201cSun Tzu said that the best victory is a victory won without weapons,\u201d Garisons said, referring to the ancient Chinese military strategist, \u201cand that is what\u2019s been happening.\u201d Now, the government is looking to education to fortify everyday Latvians against this multifaceted barrage.\""], [368, "2017-10-15T20:43:52Z", [0.0], ""], [38315, "2017-10-15T20:37:23Z", [0.25], ""], [37364, "2017-10-15T16:39:44Z", [0.01], "The narrow window for this forecast reduces the likelihood of an affirmative response to the question.

Tensions were higher during latest Zapad 2017 war games, but not much.  Russia poses a threat, mainly because their geopolitical interests always prevail anything else, including international agreements. \"Russia first\" has always been the ruling doctrine (at least in Putin era).

Also, Russia has mainly acted in response to possible change in status quo.  Does it serve Russia's geopolitical interests to engage into some kind of military provocation in the region? No, at least not in the Q timeframe. Can we expect any developments towards changing the geopolitical status quo in the region, possibly provoking military response from Russia? No, at least not in the Q timeframe. (Developments satisfying this criteria would include for example Lithuania acting to isolate Kaliningrad enclave, or Finland to militarise \u00c5land islands).

Russia and Belarus just completed a very large scale military exercise (Zapad; \"west\" in Russian) along the borders of those countries, aimed at countering an invasion by three neighboring allied countries. Which countries might the exercise be targeting? The three Baltic states and Poland have recently completed military exercises with NATO. Sweden just completed its largest military exercise in recent years on the island of Gotland, just across the Baltic Sea from the Baltic States and the Russian military enclave of Kaliningrad, home of the Russian Baltic Fleet. During its Zapad exercise, some kind of electronic jamming was used by the Russian forces in Kaliningrad, perhaps aimed at Gotland; the Swedes reported no comms interruptions, but the Estonians reported that perhaps an edge of the beam disabled the Estonian emergency frequency (like 911 in the US) for several hours. During the Zapad exercise, Russia sent elements of its Baltic Fleet to conduct exercises off the Arctic coast of Norway. The Finns are now conducting an air-defense exercise, with the participation of the Swedish air force, involving Swedish fighter jets and a Swedish AWACS aircraft, aimed at a potential attack from the east. The Lithuanians have put a fence along their border with Kaliningrad, they have mobilized volunteer reserve forces and have conducted training exercises for those forces, and have expressed concern about potential infiltration of Lithuania by irregular clandestine Russian special forces (the \"little green men\" of the Russian Crimean annexation). US Gen. Ben Hodges, commanding US forces in Europe suggests that the Russian Zapad exercise involved many more troops than the 12,700 reported by the Russians, perhaps up to 100,000. He also reported concerns about Russian units not withdrawing from the area of the exercise, and remaining quietly in place. Over the last year, there have been many Russian military flights over the Baltic Sea, between St. Petersburg and Kaliningrad, with the Russian aircraft flying with transponders off so they can't be identified and tracked, with constant interceptions of those fights by NATO aircraft. So there seems to be a strong undercurrent of military tension in the region. There could be an incursion, but with everyone on high alert, it is likely to be detected quickly and countered quickly, which would give no advantage to the Russians. A concerted effort to take the territory between Belarus, a somewhat reluctant Russian ally, and Kaliningrad\u2014the so-called Suwalki Gap, 60 miles along the shared border between Poland and Lithuania\u2014in order to provide a direct overland logistical support connection from Russia, rather than the air and sea connections now in use, would require a relatively significant armored force. Hence Gen. Hodges's concerns about Russian units left in place after Zapad. (This may part of the Russian intent in Eastern Ukraine along the Ukrainian Black Sea coast in the east, to create a logistics connection from Russia to Crimea, which now depends on Ukraine for its power, water and gas. Not good from a military perspective. Sort of like Guant\u00e1namo, no? Russia hasn't been able to complete that connection yet, and if it did, a long narrow strip of land with an opponent to the west is also not a good position to be in, militarily. On the other hand, Russia's Black Sea Fleet is exposed. But then Russia's navy, except for maybe its submarines, doesn't count for squat.) Could there be an accidental incursion? Yes. Could there be a clandestine incursion by Russian special forces? Yes, but it would have to be a precursor to a larger Russian operation; otherwise, what would be the point? Could Russia come to the aid of distressed ethnic Russians in the Baltics\u2014the numbers are quite high as a percentage of the population? Yes, and that's the most likely scenario, perhaps with hybrid warfare elements of unrest stirred up by forces infiltrated into the countries, social media attacks, cyber-warfare attacks.
