On November 10, South African opposition leader Mmusi Maimane stood before a rowdy Parliament in Cape Town and argued that President Jacob Zuma should leave office. For the third time this year, Maimane appealed to members of the African National Congress, the ruling party, to support a vote against their leader. . . .  As expected, Zuma easily survived the motion ; the ANC has a clear majority in Parliament, and though many party veterans have called for him to step down, ANC lawmakers supported their leader in the vote. \u201cThe motions by the DA have become ritualistic practices founded on spurious allegations and narrow political motives,\u201d the office of the ANC\u2019s chief whip, Jackson Mthembu, said in a statement issued before the vote. . . . \n\" . . .  the ANC is still struggling to fulfill many of the promises of a free South Africa . . . Though it is still firmly in power, a string of corruption scandals dogging the Zuma administration has chipped away at its support. \" . . .  It is hard to see a way forward from the current political mess, especially after the government\u2019s anti-corruption watchdog released a report on November 2 ordering an inquiry into corruption allegations against the president and others.  \"Many see Zuma\u2019s political survival as a depressing symptom of the failed promise of the post-apartheid ANC government. In December 2015, the currency tanked after Zuma replaced his finance minister twice in a few days, widely seen as a clumsy attempt to exert control over the National Treasury. In March, the country\u2019s highest court ruled that Zuma failed to uphold the constitution by refusing to repay some of the $23 million in public funds spent on upgrades to his private estate, including a swimming pool. He has since apologized and, abiding by a court order, paid back the money. But, in April, another court ruled that he should face nearly 800 charges of corruption that had previously been dropped, a ruling that Zuma has appealed. \"Then, in local elections in August, the ANC suffered its worst-ever electoral setback; it lost its majority in three of the country\u2019s biggest cities and won less than 60 percent of the national vote for the first time since coming to power in 1994\u2014a performance many blamed on the president. \"The pressure on Zuma intensified in the first week of November, when thousands of protesters took to the streets in the capital, Pretoria, to call for his resignation, after he asked a court to block the release of the watchdog\u2019s report on fresh corruption allegations against him. Zuma withdrew the request, and the report was released, but the mood was ugly  . . . On November 15, after losing his attempt to pass a motion of no confidence, Maimane submitted an affidavit to police requesting they investigate \u201cpossible criminal offences\u201d committed by Zuma and others mentioned in the report. \" . . .  Since Zuma came to power in 2009, allegations of cronyism have led to a decline in his popularity; according to a March poll from research company Ipsos, nearly two-thirds of those polled think the country is going in the wrong direction. Today, more than a quarter of the population is unemployed. Inequality continues to be a drag on the economy and a stain on society, with the black majority earning far less income on average and suffering from much higher rates of poverty than the white minority. \". . . .ANC leaders promised greater introspection after its historic loss in the local elections, but conflicts within the party over Zuma have become starker. In October, 101 party veterans penned an open letter airing their concerns over the ANC\u2019s direction. \"Those seeking Zuma\u2019s removal will face resistance from members of the ANC leadership who have a vested interest in keeping Zuma in office . . . those party members are entangled in the same patronage networks that Zuma has been accused of perpetuating. \u201cThey cannot act against him because they would also be vulnerable,\u201d . . . . \u201cOnce you remove the head, the network becomes exposed.\u201d \"For now, Zuma probably has the numbers he needs to survive, at least in the short term. The ANC members pushing behind the scenes for a leadership change need to wait until they have a comfortable majority within the party to make their move, . . . \u201cThey\u2019re not going to play that hand until it\u2019s safe to do so.\u201d \"The other problem for would-be challengers within the party is that the ANC also has yet to settle on a successor. . . .  \"Zuma\u2019s critics inside the party say the nation can\u2019t wait two years. The longer Zuma is the face of the ANC, the more its image suffers. \u201cThere is not a day that goes by without a bad Zuma story,\u201d says Susan Booysen, a professor at Wits University in Johannesburg. \u201cIt\u2019s doing huge damage to the ANC.\u201d \"Zuma is not immune to the mounting pressure.

In a broader context, a Zuma resignation would have an enormous impact on what passes for democracy in Africa. Consensus is so low on this question because African presidents - Nkurunziza, Kabila, Jammeh, Mugabe, dos Santos, Idriss Deby, Afwerki etc etc - don't resign, no matter what.

Chris Landsberg is Director: Centre for Policy Studies at the University of Johannesburg. He was speaking at the launch of Adekeye Adebajo's Thabo Mbeki: Africa's Philosopher-King hosted by the Centre for Conflict Resolution. Zuma's term is set to end in 2019 when we (are scheduled to) go to the polls again for a general election. This is Zuma's second term. There are constitutional term limits which preclude him from serving a third term. It is probable that the Zuma presidency will be brought to and end by a decision by the ruling ANC to 'recall' and replace him (as happened in 2008 when Thabo Mbeki was replaced by Kgalema Motlanthe who served until the 2014 general election). We (South Africans) elect a parliament which then chooses a president. So, in effect, the ruling party decides who is to be president. The ANC is the dominant party and, by convention, its president becomes the country's president. The fiction in the ANC is that one does not openly campaign for office but one is deployed at the wish of the party faithful.  The idea that Zuma will flee is unlikely. The current corruption allegations relate to the notion of State Capture and in particular, the involvement of the Indian immigrant Gupta family in various murky transactions. In addition, Zuma may be charged with corruption related to the earlier arms deal. The opposition is pursuing the reinstatement of 783 charges in this regard. If prosecutors are forced to proceed with these charges, the risk of flight may increase but it is currently an unlikely prospect."], [691, "2016-06-14T12:14:34Z", [0.07], ""], [368, "2016-06-13T22:01:07Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-06-13T20:50:20Z", [0.07], ""], [25601, "2016-06-13T10:21:19Z", [0.25], "We have Local Government elections on 3 Aug 2016.
