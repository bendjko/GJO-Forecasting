If this accusation is true, then it represents the third incident involving Chinese vessels in 2019 (the final numbers of incidents in 2018 and 2017). The statistic doesn\u2019t imply a drastic change itself as the number of incidents so far in 2019 cannot be classified as a significant increase compared to 13 in 2016. However, the quality of this incident is a novelty. According to Philippine officials, the Chinese vessel caused the Philippine vessel to sink. Furthermore, the Chinese vessel didn\u2019t provide emergency relief to the Philippine crew. This represents the willingness to accept collateral damage at the expanse of the well-being of foreign fishermen. A future update will include the investigation of this case in order to assess if the Chinese fishing vessel acted on the behalf of Chinese authorities, hence showing that the latter one shifted to a more hostile strategy.  The close encounter of a Russian and US warship in the Philippine Sea (US statement)/East China Sea (Russian statement) doesn\u2019t involve China directly. Nevertheless, it represents an important event as political commentators conclude that Russia deliberately conducted this collision attempt in order to signal support for Chinese claims in the region and to deepen Sino-Russian relations. Such actions normalize future aggressive manoeuvres and could lead to an increase of close encounters and collisions.  This update will adjust the likelihood for a lethal confrontation as a result of these events and in regard to the involved uncertainty concerning collateral damage.

Philippine government officials have loudly condemned the actions of the Chinese fishermen, as accusations say they left behind the sinking ship and crew, thereby, breaching international maritime conduct. Chinese officials have not accepted responsibility, with some questioning the events. The event evidently mirrors many recent run-ins in the region and indicates that the situation could very easily escalate resulting in situations with lethal outcomes. However, it must be noted that the vessel, presumably, was 'civilian' i.e not run by military forces, militia or law enforcement personnel, why a potential lethal outcome of such an event would not count towards this particular scenario. \nThe East China Sea is in a similar state of political tensions, with a near collision between Russian and American war ships. While, this incident does not involve China, it too underlines that that confrontations easily occur in these waters. \nThat being said, while the potential for confrontations in both seas remain high, recent events do not indicate that OFFICIAL Chinese vessels are nearer to being involved in confrontations that will have lethal outcomes, and I therefore, maintain my current prediction. \nSources: \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/13/world/asia/south-china-sea-philippines.html\nhttps://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/06/houthi-missile-strike-saudi-arabia-abha-airport-wounds-26-190612090351880.html"], [691, "2019-06-13T12:28:56Z", [0.05], ""], [3429, "2019-06-11T18:29:17Z", [0.0], "I do expect that this will change in the future.

It is China's understanding, and wish, to control the entirety if the South China Sea, which has led to a number of disputes with a number of other South China Sea bordering states, such as Malaysia, The Philippines, Vietnam and Indonesia. According to Forbes, China will fail to control the South China Sea, as it lacks the resources and capabilities to successfully seize the sea, therefore the grand strategy is doomed to end badly (https://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2019/06/08/china-must-either-trim-its-south-china-sea-sails-or-face-disaster/#210e38362975).  China's major issue in the South China Sea is that it is all alone. It is one player against all the other, including the navies of US, Japan, France, the UK, and Australia. These navies seek to enforce the freedom of navigation in the vast trade waterway Forbes point out (https://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2019/06/08/china-must-either-trim-its-south-china-sea-sails-or-face-disaster/#5fe77d422975). Yannis Tsinas, a retired Washington diplomat and Greek naval officer, points out that even though China has made major improvements to its naval and military capabilities, it still does not match those of the US and its allies.  If one assumes that China is aware of this, as one must in this case, the natural response is also to assume that China would want to be careful in the South China Sea, in order to avoid a lethal confrontation, seeing as the consequences would be grave. However, their rhetorics tell a different story, having at several occasions pointed out that they are willing to do whatever to gain control of the sea, indicating that they do not fear a lethal confrontation and the consequences. In regards to the historical data on the matter, incidents have occurred, but non that fit the criteria listed in the question.           The East China Sea has also been prone to conflict, especially between China and Japan. In June 2018 a communication line was established between the two states in order to avert accidental clashes in the air and at sea, putting aside their difference in the East China Sea, in order to avoid accidents  (https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2149835/china-japan-hotline-launched-avoid-sea-air-clashes). With that being said, tensions still remain high as both Japan and China have increased their military presence in and around the sea (https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/china-vs-japan-east-china-sea-showdown-back-61492). With this being said I land on a likelihood of 30%, solely based on China's aggressive rhetorics indicating that they will continue their aggressive strategy in both seas, resulting in the other neighbouring states having to adopt similar strategies in order to match China's. It is my understanding that lethal confrontations are more likely to occur in hostile and aggressive environments, which I feel is an accurate description of the current environment in both seas. With that being said, I also believe that none of the states surrounding the seas wishes to see a lethal confrontation happen, meaning that they will avoid it as much as possible. Hence why my percentage is not set any higher.       "], [67426, "2019-06-09T12:20:41Z", [0.12], "In 2012 China called to become a maritime power, that is capable of safeguarding its maritime rights and interests (https://chinapower.csis.org/maritime-forces-destabilizing-asia/). Since then, China has engaged in building up its fleet and capacity, including the coast guard, in modernity and size. This is shown also in increased government spending on such matters. In late 2018 the Chinese President called for increasing capacities even further and to concentrate preparations for fighting a war (https://qz.com/1440601/chinese-military-command-monitoring-taiwan-south-china-sea-ordered-war-ready/). Specifically in the South China Sea the ongoing conflict about the nine-dash line, where China claims major parts of territory in the South China Sea, is a region of heightened concern. In the past there have been a couple of clashes, however, as can be found on the China Power website, past clashes have not led to fatalities yet, even though close. The last incident was in March 2019 where a Vietnamese vessel sank because a Chinese vessel was deploying a water canon on them (https://chinapower.csis.org/maritime-forces-destabilizing-asia/). However, this would also not fit the criteria listed by GJO, as it was a Vietnamese fishing vessel and not a military force, militia or law enforcement. Those concrete incidents have not happened - yet. Overall though, as the time frame is set quite a fair bit into the future still as it covers seven months, and one cannot predict which international relations may unravel in that time, with 12% a possibility of a lethal confrontation is still given. \n\nWith regards to the East Chinese Sea, Japan as well as China have increased their capabilities as their territorial contest over the Senkakou/Diayou islands continue (https://thediplomat.com/2018/08/diaoyu-islands-dispute-a-chinese-perspective/). However, last year the two counries introduced a crisis hotline to avoid any accidental air or sea clashes (https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2149835/china-japan-hotline-launched-avoid-sea-air-clashes), and with that are establishing enhanced trust among the two countries. Furthermore, considering the joint defence treaty between the US and Japan, which also covers the territory of the Senkakou/Diayou islands, if a lethal confrontation were to happen with a fatality on the Japanese side cause by China, China might have to face also retaliative action by the US, which is not in their favour (https://www.cfr.org/interactive/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/tensions-east-china-sea). \n"], [67416, "2019-06-09T10:45:07Z", [0.09], "Update: \nReducing as the time passes.

Hence, any lethal confrontations involving a foreign state and Chinese civilians would not apply in this situation.  Firstly, I attempt to construct a (crude) base-rate by looking closer at past confrontations in the South China sea. As the focus is on lethal confrontations, I am not too concerned about the definition a confrontation, but more so on the outcome (i.e. did the interaction result in deaths). Using the https://chinapower.csis.org/maritime-forces-destabilizing-asia/ count, I account for the number of incidents in the South China Sea. I include all incidents that involve Chinese vessels, but I indicate whether these are civilian or government vessel (in incidents where both occur, I make no distinction). Lastly, I note if the incidents involving China had lethal outcomes.  South China Sea \n2019: 2 (1 civilian) (4) incident involving China, 0 fatalities \n2018: 2 (2) incidents involving China, 0 fatalities \n2017: 3 (6) (1 civilian) incidents involving China, 0 fatalities \n2016: 12 (1 unidentifiable, 3 civilian) (15) incidents involving China, 0 fatalities \n2015: 8 (10) (3 unidentifiable, 1 \u2018armed guards\u2019)  incidents involving China, 0 fatalities \n2014: 7 (7) incidents involving China, 0 fatalities \n2013: 3 (4) (1 unidentifiable) incidents involving China, 0 fatalities \n2012: 3(3), incidents involving China, 1 week-long, 0 fatalities \n2011: 6 (6) (1 civilian)  incidents involving China, 0 fatalities. \n2010: 2 (2) incidents involving China, 0 fatalities. \nIn total, there has been 59 incidents in the South China sea in the past 9 years and 48 of these have involved Chinese vessels, i.e. app. 81% of the confrontations. Out of these, 32 have been identified as official Chinese naval or coast guard vessels, i.e. 54 %. (Though there is a significant likelihood that the unidentified vessels were also official vessels). \nSo, while there has been a significant amount of confrontations in the South China sea and Chinese vessels have been involved in a majority of them, with identified government vessels being involved in just above half of them, none of the incidents involving China have had lethal outcomes!  East China Sea \nI have been unable to found similar data on confrontations in the East China Sea, but the number of Chinese government vessels is increasing in both the contiguous zone and the territorial waters around the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands. Between 2009 and August of 2012, the number of Chinese government vessels venturing into these waters, where significantly lower. Though, the ones that were present did cause confrontations, and in 2010 it came to a full-blown diplomatic dispute between the two countries.   The number of Chinese vessel rapidly increased in the summer of 2012 in response to the Japanese Government acquiring some of the aforementioned island. The ships present have increasingly been armed and in 2016 it did came to another confrontation, however, this one did not escalate to the same extent (https://chinapower.csis.org/maritime-forces-destabilizing-asia/). Generally, major conflicts regarding the East China Sea have been avoided since 2013 (https://amti.csis.org/flashpoint-east-china-sea-potential-shocks/). \nDespite confrontations and tensions in the East China Sea, it seems there have been no lethal confrontations involving the Chinese  government vessels! \nGeopolitical tensions  The South and East China Seas have long been very contested international waters with overlapping territorial claims between China and Taiwan and China and Japan. In 2012, the Chinese government declared their intention of becoming a Maritime force and extent its military focus beyond land to the sea.  In the East China Sea, the fear is that the increasing the aggression of the Chinese presence will eventually lead to new confrontations. Especially the area around the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands is a source of tension, as the Chinese government does not recognize the Japanese claim. This has meant an escalation in patrols and flyovers from both sides. As the Chinese coast guard far and the costal guards ships have doubled in numbers since 2010 (https://chinapower.csis.org/maritime-forces-destabilizing-asia/) and thereby far outweighs the Japanese, and therefore, already is straining it capabilities, fears are that future incidents around the island will be escalate faster and, potentially, be more violent in nature. This concerns extends to the American forces in the area (https://amti.csis.org/flashpoint-east-china-sea-potential-shocks/).  In the South China Sea, the territorial disputes also involve Malaysia, Brunei, Vietnam, and the Philippines. They have contested China\u2019s claims to vast areas in of the Sea and the rich oil and gas reserves, as well at the fishing stocks. The Chinese commitments to extending becoming a maritime super nation is mirrored in their military have been steadily rapidly increasing in the past years compared to other involved countries. The Chinese claim to the waters have been challenged in Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague, but China does not recognize the court\u2019s authority (https://dnnsociety.org/2016/07/15/south-china-sea-in-data/). The US\u2019 also have vested interests in the region; both to limit Chinese domination and secure free trade routes. Their presence in the area have been a source of provocation for China on more than one occasion. \nThe overlapping territorial claims, the increased military presence and the accompanying massive military spending (by especially China) shows that the East and South China Seas are indeed tense areas at the moment, where conflicts could readily spark and escalate quickly. Simultanously, data from the past 9 years show that while maritime incidents have been plentiful and Chinese vessels have been involved in majority of them, they have not had lethal outcomes. Hence, I find the chance of conflict or diplomatic disputes very likely, but the likelihood of a lethal outcome involving a Chinese government vessel within the next 6.5 months, I ascribe only a 12% likelihood. \n"], [73709, "2019-05-19T15:49:26Z", [0.05], ""], [172, "2019-05-19T15:14:15Z", [0.03], ""], [69034, "2019-05-19T13:42:43Z", [0.7], ""], [73689, "2019-05-19T06:45:17Z", [0.15], ""], [73674, "2019-05-18T21:26:57Z", [0.01], "A lethal confrontation of this type probably will happen, but not before January 1, 2020; for the time being, china has too many other problems to which it must attend.

Bush. Tensions rose in September of 2018 when the USS Decatur was challenged by the Chinese destroyer Lanzhou during an operation near Gaven Reef, one of China\u2019s artificial islands, and a collision was narrowly avoided.  The Chinese Luyang destroyer issued the stern verbal signal to the USS Decatur before sailing within 45 yards of the vessel.

Sources assert the likeliest collision scenario would involve a U.S. Navy warship and a Chinese fishing boat or China Coast Guard cutter.  Beijing uses fishing craft crewed by maritime militiamen and backed by cutters as the vanguard of its strategy in the South China Sea and the East China Sea. It floods the zone with them to the tune of thousands of fishing craft. Trawlers ply their trade in expanses where China asserts sovereign rights to natural resources. China Coast Guard white hulls dash to the rescue if a rival navy or coast guard challenges the fishing fleet\u2019s presence. \u2022\tThis is the paramilitary fleet that harassed the U.S. survey ship Impeccable in 2009 and has faced off against Philippine and Vietnamese maritime forces. There hasn\u2019t been a collision yet (with US vessels)\u2014quite\u2014but there have been close calls.  Should non-military ships block the path of an American warship and a crash ensue, the optics\u2014photos of a hulking destroyer mowing down a civilian vessel\u2014would favor Chinese efforts to brand the U.S. Navy as overbearing, blundering, or both. The truth would take a backseat to message- which bring us to: China\u2019s Three Warfare principle as a war by other means.  \u2022\tPsychological Warfare seeks to influence and/or disrupt an opponent\u2019s decision-making capability, to create doubts, foment anti-leadership sentiments, to deceive opponents and to attempt to diminish the will to fight among opponents. It employs diplomatic pressure, rumor, false narratives and harassment to express displeasure, assert hegemony and convey threats.  China\u2019s economy is utilized to particular effect. \n\u2022\tMedia Warfare (also known as public opinion warfare) is a constant, ongoing activity aimed at long-term influence of perceptions and attitudes.  It leverages all instruments that inform and influence public opinion including films, television programs, books, the internet, and the global media network (particularly Xinhua and CCTV) and is undertaken nationally by the PLA, locally by the People\u2019s Armed Police and is directed against domestic populations in target countries.  Media warfare aims to: preserve friendly morale; generate public support at home and abroad; weaken an enemy\u2019s will to fight and alter an enemy\u2019s situational assessment. It is used to gain \u2018dominance over the venue for implementing psychological and legal warfare\u2019.  \n\u2022\tLegal Warfare (or \u2018lawfare\u2019) exploits the legal system to achieve political or commercial objectives. It has a prominent role in the warfare trilogy. Lawfare has a range of applications. They range from conjuring law to inform claims to territory and resources, to employing bogus maps to \u2018justify\u2019 claims. In a distorted application of domestic law.  China also uses UNCLOS provisions and other legal conventions for unintended purposes.\nConsidering China\u2019s attempt to assert influence in the region diplomatically and economically, the likelihood of a large-scale lethal confrontation with another military entity is low.  It is possible that fatalities might occur as a result of Chinese Coast Guard cutters ramming fishing vessels (as it has in the past).   Per the parameters of this challenge- \u201ca lethal confrontation is one that results in one fatality for the military forces, militia, or law enforcement of either side.\u201d\nChina\u2019s Three Warfare approach will likely continue as the predominant means of addressing conflict, but chances for collateral damage remains possible, specifically in the context of China\u2019s paramilitary antagonist fleets and CG Cutters in an accidental or purposeful collision. \n"], [45141, "2019-05-15T19:28:06Z", [0.15], "The only person to be that stupid would be Trump."], [73206, "2019-05-14T21:30:12Z", [0.25], "Yes, due to rising tensions tensions between Chinese government and Muslims, Chinese officials are concentrating Uighur Muslims into camps.

I would argue that although both parties like to test the boundaries, they will not allow matters to escalate to lethal confrontation.  Both have a vested interest to maintain peace in the region.  Great power competition is strategic so we must look at what each wants to accomplish.  China is currently concerned with controlling access and denying area in their claimed territorial waters.  For national security, but more importantly to ensure control of the vast maritime trade routes.  The US has benefited greatly from stability in the region, from economic prosperity and stability, which China provides at the present.  China is likely to maintain the status quo because it benefits their national interests and the US will not attempt to disrupt that.  What is likely is that military forces, militia, or law enforcement will have some incidents that might seem to heat up tensions.  One such provocation recently occurred on 1 April of this year, when Chinese J-11 fighters crossed the center line in the Taiwan Strait causing Taiwan to launch their own aircraft in response.

While I do agree that it is not in any nation's interest to stoke violence in the South or East China Sea, I do not think that precludes one fatality from occurring during the prompt's time period.  From a detached Western perspective, one can easily conclude that each nations' economic interests, most major players' alliance/support/etc... with the USA, and China's focus on a very public \"peaceful\" rise would mitigate any chance of violence.  However, this calculus changes drastically for political elites and any one involved in basic commercial transactions in the region.  Although regional elites have a similar vested interest in pursuing a peaceful South/East China Sea, one can imagine how a conscripted seaman in a regional navy who lacks a professional military background might instigate some type of fight with an aggressive Chinese fishing vessel that has been re-purposed/re-tasked by the PLAN to encroach on that country's exclusive economic zone.  This might seem like an odd, or even an extreme example, but given China's blatant manipulation of international law and repeated hostile acts that fall short of other nations' abilities to respond in kind with the proper escalation of the use of force, such a scenario, or any derivative of it, cannot be discounted from leading to some type of lethal confrontation.  Therefore, while I think there is a minimal chance of a lethal confrontation occurring between Chinese and US forces in the East/South China Sea during this time period, I do think it is plausible, that such an event could occur between China and smaller regional powers before 1 January 2020.

The potential for lethal confrontations for both seas will be assessed individually and \u201csummed up\u201d later on to result in an overall forecast. After providing a brief summary of the issues concerning territorial claims the analysis will go on to assess if there were lethal confrontations (from 2010 onwards) already and how many clashes there have been between maritime vessels (China vs. X) to determine the actual conflict trend. This will be complemented by (briefly) examining the degree of militarization (in form of military spending) within the region and the diplomatic relations between opposing claimants in order to estimate the potential for future confrontations. It\u2019s worth to mention that the time frame for this forecast is fairly limited.  The UNCLOS enables states to file for an expansion of their Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), among other things. An EEZ guarantees a state the exclusive rights to use the resources, as well as provides further jurisdictional sovereignty, within its area. These expansions are often based on remote islands or other features. However, not all maritime features qualify for a rightful expansion (a core issue regarding the South China Sea). Regardless of court rulings countries in East Asia or South East Asia continue their expansion politics using the provision under the UNCLOS.  SOUTH CHINA SEA (SCS) \nThe SCS is an example of how states use the UNCLOS to expand their jurisdiction through territorial claims. Especially the archipelagos of the Paracel Islands, Scarborough Shoal and Spratly Islands are used to justify territorial claims which in some cases comprise almost the whole of the SCS. Often the maritime features, which are used to back up these expansions claims, do not qualify under the UNCLOS as \u201cnatural islands\u201d with ill-founded territorial claims as a result. Nonetheless, these maritime (artificial) features are used by littoral countries to increase their military presence, hence, consolidating their de facto control of the sea. Claimants who use this tactic are the Peoples Republic of China (PRC), the Republic of China (Taiwan), Vietnam and the Philippines (Malaysia and Brunei filed for claims but refrain from occupying maritime features). The claims of the PRC and Taiwan are identical as both states regard themselves as the only legitimate successor of the former Chinese Qing Empire. There are 3 main reasons why the SCS is lucrative for such expansions claims: 1) One of the most important international shipping routes transit through the SCS; 2) The fishing stock of the SCS are vital for the populations surrounding the sea and; 3) There are energy resources beneath the sea surface and analysts estimate that the actual amount of natural gas/oil might be higher than expected. Unfortunately, the mentioned claims overlap each other (Vietnam & PRC/Taiwan claims are almost identical) which causes increased tensions between states and an overall increased tension within the region. Additionally, the US pursue so-called Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPS) which aim to contest these claims and associated exclusive rights. The motivation lies within the US interest to defend the areas of international waters in order to maintain its military mobility and its ability to guarantee unobstructed passage for commercial vessels. All the mentioned aspects are drivers of the conflict and contribute to tensions and their development within the region.   Indeed, in 2015 and 2017 death incidents occurred in the SCS. However, none of them involved the PRC. These incidents might indicate a higher level of aggression in the region after all. The amount and intensity of confrontations between a PRC vessel(s) and other vessel(s) are distributed as follows:  YEAR | total amount | # of incidents with shots involved (guns and other) | # of incidents with ramming of ships involved | long time events occurred | events with more than 30 vessels occurred (# of vessels)  2010 | 2 | none | none | none | no\n2011 | 6 | 1 | none | none | yes (30+) \n2012 | 3 | 1 | none | 1 | no\n2013 | 4 | 1 | none | none | no\n2014 | 7 | none | 2| 2 | yes (100+) \n2015 | 14 | none | 7 | none | no\n2016 | 13 | 3 | 7 | none | no\n2017 | 3 | 2 | none | none | no\n2018 | 3 | none | 1 | none | no In 2011 and in 2014 the conflict escalated up to a point which resulted in mass gatherings of ships. The peak of total amounts of incidents was in 2015 with 14 and closely followed by 2016 with 13 total incidents. 2016 could be called the most intense year with 3 incidents of fired shots and 7 ramming manoeuvres. 2017 and 2018, with only 3 total incidents each, represent a sharp decline in comparison to the years before. While the former year involved two incidents of fired shots, the latter only contains 1 event with ramming manoeuvres and, hence, could be called the calmest year since 2010. As a result, the current conflict trend can be assessed to be fairly low.   The militarization will be assessed by comparing the total military expenditure, as well as the expenditure as a share of gross domestic product (in constant 2017 US$; in m.) in the years 2010 (% of GDP) | 2012| 2014 | 2016 | 2018.  PRC: 137\u2019890 (1,9%)| 161\u2019441 (1,8%)| 191\u2019627 (1,9%)| 215\u2019718 (1,9%)| 239\u2019223 (1,9%)\nTaiwan: 10\u2019176 (2,0%)| 10\u2019634 (2,1%)| 9\u2019985 (1,8%)| 10\u2019343 (1,8%)| 10\u2019458 (1,8%)\nVietnam: 3\u2019463 (2,3%)| 3\u2019765 (2,2%)| 4\u2019337 (2,3%)| 5\u2019089 (2,4%)| 5\u2019451 (2,3%)\nPhilippines: 2\u2019623 (1,2%)| 2\u2019706 (1,2%)| 2\u2019866 (1,1%)| 4\u2019223 (1,4%)| 3\u2019753 (1,1%)\nUSA: 784\u2018835 (4,7%)| 731\u2018086 (4,2%)| 631\u2018513 (3,5%)| 612\u2018889 (3,2%)| 633\u2018565 (3,2%) For comparison (expenditure as a share of GDP in 2017 US$ in m.) (biased sample!):   \nPoland: 1,8% | 1,8%| 1,9% | 1,9% | 2,0% \nSaudi-Arabia: 8,6% | 7,7% | 10,7% | 9,9% | 8,8% \nIran:  2,9% | 2,8% | 2,3% | 3,0% | 2,7% \nNigeria: 0,5% | 0,5% | 0,4% | 0,4% | 0,5%  Taiwan\u2019s expenditures stagnated in total and relative terms. The Philippines\u2019 and Vietnam\u2019s total expenditures increased from 2010 to 2018, however, the ratio regarding \u2018share of GDP\u2019 remained (more or less) steady. The PRC\u2019s total expenditure increased by roughly 100 Billion US$ from 2010 to 2018 which equals an increase of 173%. Nonetheless, the military expenditure remained (more or less) the same with regards to the GDP at 1,9%. It is worth to mention that the PRC\u2019s Navy (PLAN) focused on smaller vessels to increase the overall number of Navy vessels. The USA spend in 2018 almost 634 Billion US$ for military expenditures which equals 3,2%. Also, the USA cut their military budget since 2010 in total and relative terms. The data about military expenditure regarding littoral states (who occupy maritime features) of the SCS implies that there is no arms race due to lack of sharp raises of military budgets. It could be expected that littoral states would increase their military spending significantly if they expect that a major confrontation will occur. Nevertheless, the rise of the total budget bears the possibility for an increased conflict potential itself. Another factor which increases the potential of confrontation is the raised expenditure for coast guard vessels (or other maritime authorities\u2019 vessels). Most encounters in the SCS and ECS involve such vessels rather than military ships. Indeed, the spending and the tonnage for such vessels increased from 2010 to 2016 for the PRC, Vietnam and the Philippines (no data available for Taiwan). The PRC almost doubled its actual tonnage from 2010 to 2016. Nevertheless, the spending for the coast guard only grew moderately. One result could be an increase of confrontations as these ships are used to \u201cattack\u201d the opponent indirectly. However, the actual trend of incidents is declining despite the increased tonnage which puts this aspect into perspective.  The PRC and Taiwan maintain a hostile relationship towards each other based on their common history. Both states see themselves as the rightful successor of the former Qing empire. The PRC repeatedly express their opinion that Taiwan is still a part of continental China and refuses to acknowledge Taiwan\u2019s independence. However, the USA is supporting Taiwan, therefore, it seems unlikely that the PRC would act too aggressive towards Taiwan and Taiwanese vessels. The relationship between the PRC and the Philippines has been improving significantly since Duterte became president. This new relationship is built at the expanse of the US-Philippine relations. The US still calls the Philippines a close ally and maintains defence treaties with the country. Besides recent negative diplomatic trends, the Philippines confirmed that the USA are allowed to continue using military bases in the country. The PRC can only undermine this alliance by approaching the Philippines in a more cooperative manner. Indeed, that\u2019s happening through Chinese investment projects as part of the overall Road and Belt initiative. Assessing the relationship between the PRC and Vietnam is complex. Both countries fought each other in the Sino-Vietnamese war. The majority of incidents in the SCS are Sino-Vietnamese confrontations. Also, the government in Hanoi is recently trying to improve its relationship with the USA. On the other hand, this new relationship isn\u2019t strong enough yet to impose a real strategic threat to the PRC. For instance, it seems unlikely that Vietnam would adhere to US sanctions imposed on Russia who is an important trading partner for the country. Furthermore, Vietnam\u2019s economic stability depends on exports/imports to the PRC. As a result, despite minor incidents in the SCS, it seems unlikely that Vietnam and the PRC would provoke major confrontations. Finally, there is a possibility for a Sino-US confrontation. Indeed, the US Navy reports that PRC vessels shadowed US Navy ships in the past and that, despite some critical events, the Navy command will maintain its strategy to conduct FONOPS close to Chinese artificial islands in the SCS. However, both countries are too intertwined to risk an outbreak of a major conflict between them. Trump\u2019s current policy of punitive tariffs against the PRC does not significantly decrease the importance of this trade relation. Ramming and harassing might increase in Sino-US encounters, though, both states should be very hesitant to inflict serious damage on each other or even cause the death of an opponent\u2019s military personnel.  To conclude, the SCS represents one of the major political arenas in this and (at least) the following decade. Littoral states as well as powers with global reach try to influence the development in their favour. Such political dynamics can cause confusion and might lead to an escalation which spirals out of control. However, the regional economic ties, the actual trends and the low interest of involved parties to seriously escalate the conflict decreases the likelihood for lethal confrontations within the SCS. EAST CHINA SEA (ECS) \nThe epicentre of the conflict of interest between the PRC and Japan lies on the territorial affiliation of the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands (comprising uninhabited islands and maritime features) in the ECS. Both states claim that they are the legitimate owner of these islands. There has been a territorial dispute since 1895 when Japan established its sovereignty over the islands after defeating the Chinese Qing Empire. After the Japanese defeat in the WW2 the islands were property of individuals, but still remained within the Japanese jurisdiction as a part of the state. The PRC officially stated its claim in the 1970s based on historical rights derived from the Qing empire. Latest tensions stem from events in 2012 when Japan\u2019s government bought 3 islands within the archipelago. The Diaoyu/Senkaku islands\u2019 value derives from its strategic position next to one of the most important international shipping routes, lush fish stocks and energy resources reservoirs.  The last incident was a clash between Chinese fishermen and the Japanese coast guard near the Diaoyu/Senkaku islands in 2010. Zack Cooper, analyst from the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative (CSIS), elaborates why new incidents are more likely to happen in the future by presenting scenarios which would lead to higher tensions or even a military escalation. He argues that clashes are more likely to happen due to ongoing disputes over fishing rights, the increasing number of PRC or Taiwanese vessels in the disputed waters, the rise of activities concerning the oil and gas exploitation, an aggressive implementation of air rights above disputed areas and potential collisions through the increased use of unmanned vehicles. These are fictious scenarios which might happen but don\u2019t have to take place. As a result, it seems very unlikely that a lethal confrontation will take place until the end of this year as this would be an extraordinarily fast escalating scenario itself.   Japan: 44\u2018496 (1,0%) | 44\u2018552 (1,0%)| 44\u2019836 (1,0%) | 45\u2019351 (0,9%) | 45\u2019362 (0,9%)\nPRC: 137\u2019890 (1,9%)| 161\u2019441 (1,8%)| 191\u2019627 (1,9%)| 215\u2019718 (1,9%)| 239\u2019223 (1,9%) Japan\u2019s military expenditure remains (roughly) the same in total and relative terms. The Japanese spending for their coast guard remained (almost) the same in relative terms but increased in the actual tonnage. Nonetheless, these numbers don\u2019t indicate a Japanese militarization.   The diplomatic relationship between the PRC and Japan are heavily influenced through the Japanese invasion of China during the second world war. Up to this day, the PRC lacks trust in Japan\u2019s regional ambitions. Chinese politicians also accuse Japan of a lack of humility with regards to committed atrocities by Japanese soldiers. On the opposite side Japan mistrusts the PRC\u2019s regional goals as it critically assesses the Chinese efforts to increase their military capabilities, as well as its ambitious economic development projects (One Belt One Road initiative), as a wave of Chinese expansionism. However, the PRC and Japan maintain vital economic ties between them which decreases the probability for a deliberate escalation. The implemented \u201ccommunication mechanism\u201d will further help to avoid serious confrontations and will boost regional collaboration among all involved parties.  To conclude, this forecast assesses a very low probability that there will be a lethal confrontation in the SCS or ECS. Indeed, there are clashes from time to time and these contain the potential to spiral out of control. However, the overall political and economical dynamics don\u2019t indicate a drastic increase of tensions in these regions as the amount of confrontations decline while the military budgets remain stable (or in the case of the PRC: it raises within \u201creasonable\u201d levels). This might change in the following years if the PRC and littoral states maintain their occupation strategy while the international community remains absent. The Council on Foreign Relations back this assessment by determining the conflict potential as \u201cUnchanging\u201d for both areas. Also, the average of the crowd forecast tends towards a low percentile.  Note: A future update will examine US reports regarding their FONOPS in the SCS and the ECS.

It is even believed to be potentially the most dangerous point of conflict in Asia. Regardless, I believe that a lethal confrontation in the South or East China Sea between the military forces, militia, or law enforcement personnel of China and another country has a very low likelihood to occur before 1 January 2020. \n\n\tSouth China sea has been a reason of dispute between several countries, such as China, Taiwan, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei. While other countries claim several islands, reefs, rocks or other somewhat minor parts of the sea, the people\u2019s Republic of China (RPC) and the Republic of China (known as Taiwan) are the ones that argue that almost whole part of the South China sea is theirs. The worth of the global trade passing through the sea every year has been estimated to be 5 trillion US dollars, making it very attractive for all the countries involved.  \tChina\u2019s been quite harsh while demanding its part in the South China Sea. Back in 2009 they even issued \u201cdashed line\u201d map. Beijing is basically occupying and building on disputed parts of the South China sea. As described by some, \u201cits activities are the most widespread and destabilizing\u201d. The major drivers for China to seek the territories of the sea are: first, the sea is rich in oil, giving China economic benefits to become energy exporter; second, China sees the sea as its \u201cfront door\u201d and tries to make it as secure as possible; and third, the South China sea has been perceived as a matter of nationalism and identity within Chinese people. These three reasons also make it very complicated to negotiate on the matters of the dispute with China.  \tChina is trying to become a \u201cmaritime power\u201d and there have been 70 significant incidents in the South China sea since 2010. According to statistics, at least one Chinese maritime law enforcement was involved in 73% of the incidents. The peak of incidents was in 2015-2016, after that the number of incidents was reduced and we might expect the numbers to remain the same, as it demonstrates that there\u2019s a low likelihood that there will be any military, militia or law enforcement personnel in the sea before 1 January 2020. Besides, since from 2010 in the lethal confrontation there weren\u2019t any of those institutions involved.   \tThe East China Sea has been a reason of disputes between the People\u2019s Republic of China, Japan and South Korea, mainly on the extent of the exclusive economic zones. There have been number of incidents. For example, one occurred in 2010 between Japan and China resulting in the arrest of the Chinese fishing captain and causing a diplomatic row between the parties. Another major incident took place in 2016. Around 300 fishing vessels and 16 CCG vessels entered the area of the sea. Japan didn\u2019t expect this and lodged over 30 protests with the Chinese government. According to the Japanese officials, Chinese vessels constantly enter the territorial sea and contiguous zones using armed forces. However, the countries involved have been negotiating on peaceful solutions, since an armed conflict in the sea will be devastating for everyone. \tI believe that there are higher chances that something above-mentioned can occur in the South China sea, but I also assume that the current trend will continue and there won\u2019t be a lethal confrontation between the military forces, militia or law enforcement personnel of China and other country before January 1st of 2020.

The available data suggests that a lethal confrontation between China and another country would be unlikely. Since 2010, there have been 63 maritime incidents in the South China sea, in 54 of these China was an actor, yet China was not a actor in the 3 three incidents since 2010 that left a total of 4 fisherman dead (https://chinapower.csis.org/maritime-forces-destabilizing-asia/). This is significant for two reasons. First, the three incidents that have occurred in the South China Sea resulting in death wouldn't count as a lethal confrontation because there were no military, militia or law enforcement deaths. Secondly, incidents involving China seem to be handled more professionally as no deaths have been reported. This is not to say that China doesn't engage in aggressive behavior as they certainly have fired upon ship and rammed them, but rather that other maritime sea actors  tend to refrain from engaging in aggressive actions against China. Thereby, decreasing the probability of a lethal confrontation. Another important point is that there has been a deescalation in the past years. Incidents reached their peak in 2015 and 2016 reaching high teens, but in 2017 and 2018 dropped back down to normal levels of low single digits (https://chinapower.csis.org/maritime-forces-destabilizing-asia/). If this trend continues there is a very low likelihood of lethal confrontation in the South China Sea.  The East China Sea is a bit trickier. There is less data available on incidents, but largely speaking incidents are rarer. That said the main actors are China, Japan and sometime Taiwan.  These actors easily have the capabilities to compete with each other, thereby not diffusing a situation and instead escalating it to the point where they use these capabilities, resulting in a lethal confrontation.  However, it is within all parties involved interests to deescalate conflicts, because the fallout from them would be devastating for everyone. Since 2018 efforts have been made to cooperate more in the East China Sea. For instance China and Japan announced a new crisis hotline in June of 2018 in order to improve communication and avoid incidents (https://www.cfr.org/interactive/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/tensions-east-china-sea).  In sum, the South China Sea has a greater chance of incidents occurring, but because of China's superiority  a lower chance of one of these incidents being a lethal confrontation and the current trend is a deescalation of conflict. That said it only takes one Chinese vessel to act aggressively towards a Coast Guard vessel of another country, potentially causing a fatality. For this reason I give the likelihood of this happening a 5% chance by January 1st, 2020. Now in the East China Sea there is a lower likelihood of incidents, but a higher likelihood of a lethal confrontation because of more equal capabilities of the actors. This means that the actors are less likely to back down in an incident and have the option to use not only lethal force, but more deadly lethal force. While tensions do remain high in this area there are signifiers that indicate possible deescalation, moreover it is all parties interests to keep lethal confrontations from happening as there is a high potential of their being significant consequences. Therefore, it is possible, but remains unlikely that a lethal confrontation will occur, therefore, I grant the likelihood to be 5% in the East China Sea. \n"], [34920, "2019-04-29T06:30:07Z", [1.0], ""], [72713, "2019-04-29T04:43:22Z", [0.0], "There is definitely some d**k swinging going on on the South China Sea.

As of now China's growing influence has gone largely unchecked by the other powers and for a power to check Chinese influence in South China Sea with military force is very unlikely. For China to engage In a conflict with a country with connections to the United States and its allies would result in a devastating diplomatic crisis that both countries would want to avoid.

So the likelihood of another lethal clash occurring in 2019 could be estimated as of about 5% - with no lethal clash so far having occurred in the East China sea (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_South_China_Sea_dispute#cite_note-64). Based upon the former mentioned incidents 3 actors can be detected, with relevance for the question at hand: Vietnam, China and the US. Additionally, Japan plays a crucial role. Noticeably, 3 out of the 4 lethal incidents were between China, on the one hand, and South Vietnam, as well as after the reunification Vietnam, on the other hand. Furthermore, one incident took place with respect to the US (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_South_China_Sea_dispute#cite_note-64). Thus, a look into Chinese-Vietnamese-US current relationships is crucial for an adequate forecast, as well as in a second step, an analysis of Japanese-US-Chinese relationships in order to include the likelihood of a lethal incident materializing in the East China sea, despite the fact that it hasn\u2019t happened yet. By covering the regional states Vietnam and Japan, as well as the great powers China and the US the forecast at hand gives credit to the fact that even though the conflicts started as regional disputes between neighboring states,China\u2019s role as an aspiring great power and the US, on the other hand, aiming to maintain its influence in East Asia, led to the current state of affairs, where the disputes now have expanded to include the elements of great power competition. Interests and perceptions of the neighboring states mix with aspects of strategic competition between the USA and China (https://www.swp-berlin.org/fileadmin/contents/products/studien/2017S03_cbk.pdf).  With regard to the Vietnam-US-China Triangle, it is worth noticing that Vietnam - whenever its sovereignty has been challenged, has reacted extremely consequent. This is particularly true for the South China Sea. This goes hand in hand with an overwhelmingly negative perception within Vietnamese population towards China and the threat it poses to Vietnamese sovereignty (http://time.com/5440653/vietnam-us-china-balance/), as well as a strategic partnership with the US to counter Chinese interests in that region. However, China remains the most important trade partner of Vietnam and both regimes share close ideological backgrounds. Furthermore, Communist Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong who assumed the role of President on October 23, 2018, has close ties with communist leaders in China. While China\u2019s \u201cregional influence has grown as its $1 trillion Belt and Road Initiative has helped fund infra-structure projects in countries across Asia and beyond. Washington\u2019s influence on the region, by contrast, has waned under President Donald Trump, especially after he withdrew the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) intended to reduce regional reliance on Beijing.\u201d (http://time.com/5440653/vietnam-us-china-balance/). To sum up, the forecast at hand does not expect Vietnam to provoke an escalation in the South China sea due close economic and ideological ties with China. However, in case of a Chinese aggression, Vietnam is expected to react harshly, with a high likelihood of escalation and causalities.  Thus, the likelihood of a lethal incident realizing in the South China sea in 2019, depends heavily on the Chinese course of action, which in turn depends on the strategic rivalry with the US. The context of great power competition, is based upon the assumption that for China the diplomatic, economic and military efforts and costs of the disputes outstrip the possible gains by far (https://www.swp-berlin.org/fileadmin/contents/products/studien/2017S03_cbk.pdf). Thus, one can argue it is about China\u2019s great power aspirations and national self-understanding, which clashes heavily with the US\u2019s aspirations to defy corresponding actions, further prioritized and escalated by the Trump administration. Based upon this rivalry a further armament in the South Chinese Sea is expected, which lead to an increased likelihood of lethal incidents, caused by both planned and wanted actions, as well as by accidents like the lethal 2001 incident.  In the East China Sea, it is mainly Japanese and Chinese armed forces or coastguards that are involved. So far, a symbolic equilibrium had settled there. Although the US plays an important role as Japan's protective power in this conflict, unlike in the South China Sea, it has so far hardly appeared as a direct military actor. The actual territorial conflict does not yet seem to be superimposed by direct competition from major powers, and the opponents China and Japan have so far had roughly the same potential to pursue military symbolic policies. However, this equilibrium is unlikely to last long, since Japan cannot keep up with China's enormous maritime armament in the long run, although it is also making considerable efforts to arm itself. This in turn suggests that the US will sooner or later intervene in Japan's symbolic test of strength in the East China Sea, particularly because of the former elaborated aspirations of the US with regard to China (https://www.swp-berlin.org/fileadmin/contents/products/studien/2017S03_cbk.pdf). Based upon former analysis, the forecast at hand comes to the conclusion that the likelihood of lethal incidents realizing in the South or East China Sea has to be estimated higher than the initial 5% base rate, particularly due to worsening relationships between China, on the one hand, and the US, as well as Japan, respectively, on the other hand. Thus, the forecast at hand adds a 10% likelihood for an incident in the South China sea, as well as a 5% likelihood of an incident in the East China sea on the 5% base rate, concluding with a 20% likelihood for a lethal clash to materialize in 2019."], [72553, "2019-04-22T09:21:39Z", [0.02], ""], [72552, "2019-04-22T09:13:26Z", [0.0], ""], [72550, "2019-04-22T08:02:55Z", [0.12], "Comment deleted on Apr 22, 2019 08:04AM UTC"], [63658, "2019-04-22T01:35:33Z", [0.14], ""], [72525, "2019-04-21T18:57:40Z", [0.0], ""], [72515, "2019-04-21T17:08:57Z", [0.2], ""], [72520, "2019-04-21T15:52:06Z", [0.56], ""], [172, "2019-04-21T14:06:56Z", [0.03], ""], [72509, "2019-04-21T12:54:41Z", [0.01], ""], [62808, "2019-04-21T11:52:44Z", [0.0], ""], [12364, "2019-04-20T22:05:37Z", [0.0], ""], [45198, "2019-04-20T19:56:12Z", [0.1], ""], [66728, "2019-04-20T17:30:02Z", [0.05], ""], [691, "2019-04-20T14:47:41Z", [0.04], "There is some chance that a couple of Duterte's lads may lose their tempers, but still pretty improbable."], [37488, "2019-04-20T04:26:19Z", [0.06], ""], [66285, "2019-04-20T03:19:15Z", [0.13], "The probability of such a confrontation occurring by design is rather low.

In the 71 years since 1947 there have been 4 lethal clashes between Chinese military and other countries (1974, 1988, 2001, 2005) [1]. Thinking of each year as its own outcome then we see that four 4 out of 71 outcomes had a lethal confrontation, **which roughly gives 5.5% probability baserate as my best estimate.** \"\n- @Maxouforecasting: we get an average of 4.25 incidents involving China (using data since 2010); rule of three [1] gives a 95% confidence interval that the probability of lethality is less than 11.3% (34/3); multiplying that with the average number of incidents yields an upper bound of 48%; this gives a median of about 24%. I'm not very confident in this approach since the sample size is so low and the rule of three requires a fairly large sample size.

China\u2019s territorial ambition in the region has the merit to be clear as Beijing shows great interest in controlling the zone and to expand its influence.  The incidents in the South and East China sea are very common and the implication of China is as follows:\n2018: 2/2 \n2017: 3/6 \n2016: 12/15\n2015: 8/10\n2014: 7/7\n2013: 3/4 \n2012: 3/3 \n2011: 6/6\n2010: 2/2 \nHence, China is involved in almost 1/2 incidents. However, the deaths are particularly unusual and did not involve Beijing so far, or at least since 2010. Since 2010, there were 3 lethal confrontations: 2014: Philippines/Taiwan; 2015: Thailand/Vietnam; 2017: Philippines/Vietnam.  There is no doubt that Beijing is perpetually attempting to reinforce its position and capacities in the geopolitical hotspot. As an illustration of power in the area, the archipelago of Spratleys gathers the largest number of artificializations and has become a logistic extension for China in the sea. The installation of administration and economic activities on the archipelago has added a civilian presence to the military settlement. The government has made it clear that it is willing to do anything to sit down its interests. If there is currently no lethal incident involving China, the confrontations remain very agressive.   Nevertheless, on the basis of the incidents listed -- and taking into account the absence of lethal confrontation between a Chinese actor and another country since 2010 -- I give a very low probability for a lethal confrontation in the South or East China Sea before January 1st 2020. If the aggressiveness of this conflict is not lacking, I believe that China is more acting on deterrence. The \u201clittle blue men\u201d is one good illustration of this deterrence, in my opinion. By using irregular maritime forces through fishermen, Beijing settles its predominant presence while sowing confusion and frustration among opponents.  With that being said, deterrence games can be very dangerous as they can be resulting in deep insecurity, potentially leading to a higher level of confrontation (lethal).  https://qz.com/1440601/chinese-military-command-monitoring-taiwan-south-china-sea-ordered-war-ready/\nhttps://chinapower.csis.org/maritime-forces-destabilizing-asia/\nhttp://theconversation.com/les-iles-militarisees-en-mer-de-chine-du-sud-la-partie-emergee-de-la-puissance-de-frappe-de-pekin-97946\nhttps://thediplomat.com/2015/11/little-blue-men-doing-chinas-dirty-work-in-the-south-china-sea/"], [67417, "2019-04-06T15:15:53Z", [0.25], "China\u2019s claims in the South China Sea are constant since the end of WW2. In particular, Beijing claims sovereignty over the Parcels and Spratyls islands in the South China Sea and Senkaku-Diaoyu in the East China Sea. Japan, Vietnam and the United States dispute these claims and form an alliance. Last but not least, there is China\u2019s claim over Taiwan, a country military protected and assisted by the US which China as never considered as independent (but instead as its own territory). Of course, what has always held China back from moving from words to deeds is the military superpower of the US.  However, since \u201cthe great leap forward\u201d initiated by Mao Tse-tung, China has been tremendously growing, both economically and militarily, getting closer and closer to America\u2019s supremacy. Therefore, as a realist would strongly argue, it is just a matter of time before these 2 giants will clash against each other. In this sense, South and East China Sea unsolved claims might offer the perfect justification. These concerns are shared by the Pentagon. In fact, Pentagon's intelligence agency has recently published its first public report assessing the military power of China as a country that the United States increasingly views as a threat to its interests. Finally, China slowing economy and growing internal discontent might lead the communist government to embrace what in International Relations is known as a \u201crally around the flag strategy\u201d, meaning the strategy to focus the internal opinion on an external threat in order to increase support. Little wonder therefore that recently Beijing has started showing its muscles. As evidence of that, president Xi Jinping has recently ordered the Southern Theatre Command, responsible for monitoring the South China Sea and Taiwan, to boost its military capabilities to prepare for a possible conflict, according to a Hong Kong newspaper. However, given these considerations, I doubt that a lethal conformation, although very likely in the long run, will happen from now to 1 January 2020. It is undeniable that China is exponentially increasing its military presence, but at the moment it looks just a deterrence strategy, albeit particularly aggressive. Furthermore, China\u2019s is currently engaged in many delicate diplomacy actions, the \u201cnew Silk Road\u201d and China belt above all. With such ambitious trade projects, it would be counterproductive for China to attract attention to long-lasting territorial deputies. Especially now that, except for Italy (which just signed a trade memorandum with China), the European Union is raising concern regarding Chinese way to conduct business. Therefore, a sudden attack of Chinese army would give the perfect pretext to the West to blame China and adopt protectionist measures (which with both the support of the US and EU would seriously damage Chinese interests). Hence, I assess a very low likelihood of a military confrontation between China and its neighbors in the next year.  Having said that, the question does not refer to a large-scale confrontation. Cornerwise, just \u201ca lethal confrontation\u201d from now to 1 January 2020 would be enough to validate this question. This makes the likelihood less unlikely. With such a military presence in the China sea, a lethal confrontation cannot be completely excluded. It could also happen simply by error with following apologizes and no consequences, but the outcome of this forecast would still be \u201cyes\u201d.  Nevertheless, since 2010, despite many accidents and tensions, there have been no victims.  Concluding, acknowledging that a single lethal confrontation could happen at any time but that at the same time the likelihood of this happening is low, I assess a 20% chance of such an outcome.

It\u2019s since the middle of 20th century that the country pushes for the control of the South/East Chinese Sea, in particular claming the islands Paracels, Spratylas, Scarborough Reef, Macclesfield Bank, Senkaku and Diaoyu islands.\nThe area is subject of controversies of different countries claiming territories, but China is surely the most determinate and aggressive one. In the past China has already engaging periods of higher or lower tensions, and since 2010 that her presence has become more aggressive. China perpetrates attacks or debatable manoeuvres, provoking foreigner ships, or invading the territorial waters of other countries. Also, China is militarizing the area, building more and more military bases on artificial bases. The reasons of its interest are the presence of oil fields in the China meridional sea, plus the fact that it\u2019s an area extremely proliferous of trade routes. I assess the probability of a lethal confrontation to 15% because:\n- We should remember the project for which China is building infrastructure in Asia, Africa and Europe, investing an impressive flow of money: the construction of the BRI (which project is both by sea and by land). Establishing its power on the southern Chinese sea would ensure its control of the area when the project will be ready to use.\nThese investments that China is making in trade would be damaged in case of a lethal confrontation in the area, creating confusion and the reactions from local countries. So, China has no interest in overpassing the limit of the \u201csimply\u201d demonstration of power.\n- From the other side of the front, the ASEAN countries are not in the position of respond too heavily to China attacks, because, even if some of them are strong economic powers and have powerful alliances as the US, they have different interests and won\u2019t be able to compete with the power and the military superiority of China. \n- China knows that Washington has interests in the Chinese sea, wants to contrast the rise of China and in the past has defended the local countries against Chinese efforts in dominating the region (also signing agreement with countries like Japan, or the implementing project of coordinated military exercise that US is currently practicing with Philippines). Again, to have prosperity in trades China has better keep the environment around her controlled (inspiring to Monroe doctrine in the US maybe?) and not surround itself with enemies.\n- The accidents that occur from 2010 until 2018 involving in China are a lot (2 in 2010, 6 in 2011, 3 in 2012, 3 in 2013, 7 in 2014, 8 in 2015, 11 in 2016, 3 in 2017, 2 in 2018, but in none case these accidents, apparently, cause any victims.  Again, I assume that even if China is being aggressive, it is trying to obtain the most advantages from its position, even violating the International Law of the Sea, testing and deteriorating the geopolitical balances, but without overcoming the threshold of the military offended; at least not in this year.\n- China is using the \u201clittle blue men\u201d strategy (soldiers masked as fishermen but equipped with military supplies). To me, this might be interpreted as the effort of not challenging actively the local countries.\n- On the other side, China is also implementing a Code of Conduct with the ASEAN countries since 2017, is practicing some joint exercises with ASEAN countries (June 2018), and is also financing countries as Philippine and Vietnam to develop their infrastructure. Therefore, I think China is somehow practicing a dual strategy: on one side, investing in the ASEAN countries and signing bilateral agreement to create an economic dependency, on the other side, showing its military superiority. However, I asset a probability of the 15% for the presence of a military attack because, according to the statistics, the amount of accidents has increased in the last years. Also, China has never really tried to reach a peaceful balance with those countries: it didn\u2019t accept to show up in front of International Court, doesn\u2019t recognise the ASEAN countries as a unified trade partner and prefer to establish only bilateral agreement with them. Plus, the episode that\u2019s going on in the Philippines (Thitu island surrounded by around 200 Chinese ships) and the interests of US in that area can\u2019t exclude completely an escalation of the crisis.

I choose this year as my cutoff year since China wasn't able to lay claims before and during WW2 because of the Japanese. In the 71 years since 1947 there have been 4 lethal clashes between Chinese military and other countries (1974, 1988, 2001, 2005) [1]. Thinking of each year as its own outcome then we see that four 4 out of 71 outcomes had a lethal confrontation, which roughly gives 5.5% probability baserate as my best estimate. \nNote that the Wikipedia timeline only goes to 2016. I haven't found any lethal confrontations myself in 2017-2018, but I might be wrong. Looking at the specifics of South China Sea there seems to be increasing tension, more countries laying claim to islands and increased economic activity with as much as 5 trillion dollars of trade passing through the area [3]. China has also built military bases extending its military range [3]. The Wikipedia timeline also tells the story of many clashes that were close to being lethal with shots being fired at fishing ships and Chinese ships ramming other ships [1]. During Donald Trumps presidency there have been 14 incidents of varying seriousness between American and Chinese navy ships though none of them resulted in any deaths [4].  So all in all, most years are without fatal confrontations but because there are increased activity, disputed fishing rights, more military exercises by both China, the US and countries in ASEAN I forecast a higher probability than the baserate. I think that doubling the baserate is reasonable estimate.

Major players include China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia and the Philippines. These tensions have gained serious traction in more recent years, with China occupying and building up military bases on artificial islands in disputed waters.  This year\u2019s Preventative Priorities Survey, produced by the U.S. Council on Foreign Relations\u2019 Centre for Preventative Action, ranks a conflict in the South China Sea as a Tier 1 priority \u2014 indicating an anticipation of conflict by experts on global armed conflict and international disputes (CFR 17 Dec 2018).  Since 2010, there have been 59 incidents in the South China Sea. 84% of which involved at least one vessel from Chinese maritime enforcement. China has been the primary actor in the SCS disputes thus far, and given its tendency (in terms of rates), is set to continue. This statement is supported further by the stance taken by the President of China himself. President Xi  has indicated intentions \u2014 or at  least not overtly opposed \u2014 to enter into conflict in the SCS. Comments claiming it is necessary to \u201cconcentrate preparations for fighting a war,\u201d have been made (Quartz 28 Oct 2018). The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute has shown that between 2005 and 2014 military spending by China and Vietnam has risen by 167 and 170% respectively \u2014 illustrating some sort or preparedness by China and a key actor in the dispute, Vietnam. Thus, based on previous trends and Xi\u2019s reception to the idea of an armed conflict, the chance of China engaging in an armed conflict in 2019, resulting in a fatality, is considered reasonable (forecasted at 30%). However, it is considered far more likely that the dispute will remain largely symbolic (through deterrence actions eg.) and China\u2019s more aggressive actions (such as occupying large territories in the disputed waters) will go \u2018unchallenged\u2019 in a physical sense of the term. Given China\u2019s sheer size and power, it is unlikely that significantly less powerful actors will be willing to bear arms. And, in consideration of China\u2019s aggressive attitude to the dispute, an armed conflict will most likely develop if China\u2019s sovereignty were seen to be seriously threatened \u2014 possibly by key actors taking arms.  But with tensions having been ongoing for such a long period, the trend indicates that sudden escalation to armed conflict resulting in casualties is low, at least in the next 8.5 months.

There are territorial disputes in this sea for the control of the islands and archipelagos of the Spratleys, Paracels, Pratas, Scarborough Reef and Macclesfield Bank, between the various countries of South-East Asia. In March 1988, the Chinese navy defeats the Vietnamese Navy, killing 64 Vietnamese, for example. In addition, Beijing is aggressive through its actions in the area, including the takeover of the Scarborough Reef in 2012; the dispatch of air and naval patrols in the airspace and territorial waters of the Senkaku / Diaoyu Islands; the establishment of an air defense identification zone over the East China Sea in November 2013.\nTherefore, China is pursuing an expansionist policy in the region to ensure its zone of influence. China has rapidly modernized and\u00a0expanded its navy\u00a0(paywall), which last year became the world\u2019s largest, with more warships and submarines than the United States (Source : Quartz). In response, the coastal states of Southeast Asia are rearming, which tends to increase the lethal potential of the incidents. However, it becomes difficult to say whether the incidents are related to Chinese military forces or not. Indeed, the recognition and use of ships become unclear because the fishing boats are armed. Like Russia in Crimea and its \"Little Green Men\", China has been deploying \u201cLittle Blue Men\u201d in the maritime domain to harass Beijing\u2019s adversaries in the South China Sea and to press its territorial claims (Source :https://thediplomat.com/2015/11/little-blue-men-doing-chinas-dirty-work-in-the-south-china-sea/). There is therefore a broader inclusion to make to describe Chinese forces, which now includes armed \"fishermen\".

The shots, ramming, arrests, are relatively common too.

Any conflict in the South China Sea would also threaten the security of a region through which trillions of dollars of trade passes through annually, with potentially far-ranging and severe consequences\" (https://www.cfr.org/blog/top-conflicts-watch-2019-south-china-sea). The economic and national interests linked to the dispute over this sea are clear, and as such the CFR includes the possibility of conflict among the eleven conflict prevention priorities in 2019 (https://www.cfr.org/report/preventive-priorities-survey-2019). Even if the US strong claims over the area and the already mentioned issues at stake, the recent environment created between China and the Philippines - in a so cooperative sense that the Philippines' President was fiercely criticized - reduce the likelihood of deadly confrontation. All in all, I think the path the confrontation will follow will remain pacific, at least in the medium term. China has proven to be able to pursue its aims without recurring to military options, and the vast international projects on track (the new silk roads etc) could be put in jeopardy by a military escalation deriving from a lethal confrontation in the South or East China Sea. If the event to be forecasted here will happen, it wil be most likely due to an accident - law enforcement operation to remove fishermen from a contested sea area etc - which at sea are surely not negligible, most of all given the military built up in the small islands.Adding also the contested areas in the East Chinese Sea (https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/20/east-china-sea-could-be-riskier-than-south-china-sea.html), the area in which incidents (more probable) or proper military offensives (which I consider less likely) can take place is definetly huge, and very trafficked (a fair percentage of the world's maritime trade takes place in these seas)\nAdditional sources: https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/2174282/beijing-and-manila-shake-hands-south-china-sea-energy-deal\nhttps://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/2174213/china-philippines-sign-oil-and-gas-exploration-deal-xi-jinping\nhttps://qz.com/1211014/south-china-sea-militarization-nothing-to-fret-over-says-philippines-president-rodrigo-duterte/\nhttps://qz.com/1316731/south-china-sea-beijing-wont-give-up-even-one-inch-of-the-territory-it-claims/\nhttps://www.cfr.org/interactives/chinas-maritime-disputes?cid=otr-marketing_use-china_sea_InfoGuide#!/chinas-maritime-disputes?cid=otr-marketing_use-china_sea_InfoGuide\n"], [66335, "2019-03-11T18:24:22Z", [0.05], "Focus will be on reducing trade tensions and this would inflame them"], [67877, "2019-03-11T17:13:57Z", [0.25], ""], [67771, "2019-03-11T02:11:36Z", [0.07], "Breaking this down into a couple of parts, first the assumption that such an event occurs in general means (either through intent or not) and second under the assumption that escalations in tensions with any specific country causes such a conflict. General: Consensus here seems to be 5-10 %, I would generally agree with most of the rationale going into this assertion. Only hole I see here is a number of people seem to be interpreting the question as one of the two parties being military personnel, however the parsing of the question requires both to be such. Thus I'll take the low end of this range, 5%. Specific Conflicts...\n - United States: This is highly unlikely (Though perhaps more so nowadays than in the past). The only feasible way I could see this occurring is in the wake of some black-swan level of cascading conflicts as a result of the ongoing trade conflicts. I don't see this adding any tangible contribution to my prediction. (< 0.1%)\n - North Korea: Again highly unlikely, North Korea exists in large part due to the complacency of China & China's interests in the Korean peninsula are better off with a cohesive North Korea. I don't foresee any events that would  disrupt this relationship\n - India or Pakistan: If this conflict were to escalate dramatically (unlikely, but given recent transgressions plausible) then China would be placed in an uncomfortable position. Support Pakistan & risk open conflict with India (Highly unlikely, but again fully plausible) or isolate Pakistan and risk open conflict along China's Belt & Road Initiative. I would consider this very-unlikely overall, but given the recent open conflict this is substantially higher than the previous two considerations. I'll say 2% as of now.\n - Taiwan: Technically Taiwan is considered to be part of the Republic of China, thus I'm assuming this question would include them as such? I'll predict this under this assumption, otherwise this would potentially increase the odds a decent amount (assuming reunification talks go south). The most likely course here in my view would be rebel pro-independence forces in Taiwan rebelling against the seemingly pro-unification government in Taipei.\n - Philippines: Duterte has openly stated that the Philippines are nowhere near equipped to instigate conflict with China, and the US has stated it's intent to support the country if necessary. I would place intentional conflict at a similar level as conflict with the US directly, < 0.1% Aside from other black-swan level events (i.e. economic collapse of China, regime change, etc.) occurring in the next < 9 months I don't see any other plausible intentional triggers, though this is one I will look to update moving forward."], [172, "2019-03-11T00:47:40Z", [0.03], ""], [45217, "2019-03-10T20:55:45Z", [0.1], ""], [19340, "2019-03-10T17:19:01Z", [0.0], ""], [64264, "2019-03-10T15:41:15Z", [0.5], ""], [67851, "2019-03-10T13:30:21Z", [0.05], ""], [67415, "2019-03-10T13:13:58Z", [0.1], "China's official policy in the region is to defend its territory in the China Seas, however it has recently stated in public that countries with conflicting claims do not have to worry about 'being attacked' (https://elevenmyanmar.com/news/south-china-sea-attacks-worry-about-other-side-chinese-envoy-asianewsnetwork). China states that \"We are concerned more about the peace and stability\", and that it is more concerned by attacks from the 'other side'.  None of the countries claiming territories in the China Sea are anywhere close to the military capabilities of China and therefore it is not likely they will attack a Chinese ship.\nThe USA, that is the 'peace keeper' in the Seas, is not likely to start agressions as it simply can't politically afford such incidents with China at this point.

Power lies in perception, not material; and with China holding the #1 spot in terms of GDP (PPP), it is unlikely that any state will want to jump into any military confrontation with China, who has steadily increased its military spending over the last decade. What I'm getting at is that China looks too daunting for any state to be willing to start the fighting, placing this question's burden on China starting the confrontation.  Let's see if China is bold enough to start confrontation:\nFor example, the Sino-Japanese dispute over the Diaoyu Islands, predating WWII, is a good example to observe Chinese actions in the South/East China Sea. Various treaties and war reparations have left the islands' sovereignty claims to interpretation, but the Chinese have aggressively (but without force) established de facto control over the area through their pursuit of strategic positioning and economic exploitation. What's keeping China from using force, though, is the presence of the United States (due to treaty obligations to Japan after post WWII occupation) in the region. China is a huge potential military power, but the likelihood of China starting the confrontation is tiny. They have a quasi-navy (coastguard) patrolling the S/E Sea protecting their economic interests there, and I doubt that the US would want to harm those interests (mutual benefit), so they'll leave China alone for the time being while using sanctions and the UN to give the CCP a small slap on the wrist. The legal claims brought forth by China to these islands (and the similar southern ones) are far stronger than that of the Japanese, and have held ground when combined with their military/economic presence. I don't think they'll need to use force, or \"lethal confrontation\" to sustain their efforts in the area, so I'm not going to predict that China to will attack either.  That just leaves me with placing this prediction at 3%. I don't see any state mustering up the courage to attack China, nor do I foresee China pushing any lethal force as their current tactics have already made so much progress; that knocks off a solid 99% of this happening.

Out of these 26 disputes, none have produced a fatality. Out of these 26 disputes, only 8 resulted in the use of force by one of the disputants (31%). Of these 8 uses of force, none were carried out by China. It appears to me that a fatality is highly unlikely given a strong outside view. I know I'm looking at all of China's disputes, but doing so offers stronger support for my assessment.  Even at the peaks of tension in the South China Sea during the three Taiwan Strait crises, only 2 US troops were killed -- although accidentally. Although Taiwanese and Chinese forces were killed during these crises, I do not anticipate a new Taiwanese crisis any time soon. Taiwan's defenses have improved substantially since then and any serious operation to seize the island would likely falter, according to my understanding of recent assessments. Moreover, the last crisis which occurred in 1995 resulted in no fatalities. If anything, it appears there is a strong mutual effort to avoid escalation despite the serious territorial disagreements in the region.  Nevertheless, this does not discredit the threat of a future escalation of hostilities in the region. China's capabilities in the South China sea are expanding rapidly, eroding the credibility of the US's threat of deterrence. If anything, the likelihood of serious conflict is increasing over time, especially in consideration of China's overall dissatisfaction with the region's status quo. However, the probability of a fatality resulting, in my estimation, is low for the following year.

If you assume that the probability of a lethal confrontation is constant from year to year, and we've only seen 1 of these since 1990 (that I'm aware of) then you can model this as binomial distribution. For a given year, there are two outcomes - either 0 lethal confrontations, or 1+ confrontations. The two columns show (A) the probability of getting 1+ confrontations in a given year and (B) the corresponding probability for seeing exactly 1 confrontation over a sample of 28 years.  Column B is highest around 4%, which corresponds to the simple division 1/28=3.57%. This means that (if the above assumption is sound) the most likely reality we're in is in the 1-8% range. So 4% seems to be a suitable base rate, and this can be adjusted up or down depending on 2019's political situation. As I mentioned in my previous forecast, there are 1-2 strong reasons for adjusting up slightly and 1-2 strong reasons for adjusting down slightly. I think the \"growing tensions\" headline masks actual developments in co-operation; so reasons for adjusting down are stronger. I'm thinking 3% might even be too high; 2% more accurate but I have the fear in me.

(Most confrontations are military vs non-military \u2013 a military vs non-military confrontation is much less likely to result in a death for a member of the military.) Very, very few of these result in military deaths (e.g. 2001 Hainan Island incident). So since, say, 1990, there has been a single death in a military vs military confrontation in the South China Sea. (Please correct me if I am wrong.) 1 death over 28 years. (Edit: Not 18!!)\n    \u2022 Countries commonly use diplomacy to resolve disputes. (e.g. in 2015, Malaysia sent a diplomatic note about a ship at Luconia Shoals; Indonesia in 2015 announces that it will pursue legal action over Natuna Islands; Philippines said they are willing to share resources).\n    \u2022 On the other hands, Indonesia uses rattlesnake tactics too; Indonesian president visited Natuna Islands on a warship (https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-06-23/joko-widodo-visits-south-china-sea-amid-tension-with-china/7539164). But keep in mind the president was on board \u2013 so, just from this incident, we can\u2019t conclude that sailing warships past disputed territory is part of Indonesia\u2019s policy.\n    \u2022 There\u2019s also an argument here (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/global-opinions/wp/2018/10/09/how-president-trump-is-helping-beijing-win-in-the-south-china-sea/?noredirect=on). I don\u2019t put much stock in opinion posts generally, but this one is by Robert D. Kaplan, who wrote an excellent book on the South China Sea. Kaplan argues that a) China\u2019s policy isn\u2019t about armed conflict, but a steady resource and land creep; and b) the uncertainty caused by Trump\u2019s zigzag approach to policy causes Asian leaders to look to each other. East China Sea summary\n    \u2022 Since 1990ish, there have only been two disputes that I\u2019m aware of, with 0 total military deaths (2010 Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands; 2012 Chinese reconnaissance aircraft). Seems reasonable to count the confrontations in the South China Sea and those in the East China Sea as similar populations.\n    \u2022 There\u2019s an excellent report here, although it is from 2013 (https://www.cfr.org/report/sino-japanese-clash-east-china-sea). The report argues that two most likely types of dispute are \u201cAccidental or unintended incident\u201d or \u201cPolitical miscalculation in demonstrating control\u201d. It says that \u201cDeliberate action to take islands\u201d is highly unlikely.\n    \u2022 An accidental or unintended incident is far more likely to involve civilians than two militaries. A political miscalculation is less clear. Other factors (a.k.a. The Other Hand)\n    \u2022 The military spending of China has increased almost exponentially since the late 1990\u2019s. This could mean that a military conflict is more likely. But this hypothesis would mean that there is more military confrontations (even those not involving deaths) in the S/E China Seas since the 1990\u2019s. There seems to have been a hot-spot of confrontations in 2014-16; but the rate here isn\u2019t much higher than the base rate. It\u2019s certainly not exponentially increasing. This means that it isn\u2019t hands-down obvious that more military spending means more chance of a military conflict in the Seas.\n    \u2022 Then there\u2019s the uncertainty factor \u2013 as the world transitions from unipolar to multipolar, uncertainty increases. (Another force behind this is Trump\u2019s less coherent foreign policy.) But more uncertainty in an estimate doesn\u2019t mean that the base rate should increase; and, as outlined above, I also think that the transition from unipolarity to multipolarity makes Asian countries more likely to work with China rather than try to engage in conflict. Taken together\n    \u2022 The one death since the 1990\u2019s means roughly a baseline of 3.7% deaths per year. (Edit: Not 5% as I mistakenly posted)\n    \u2022 The rate for East China Sea is probably lower \u2013 there are fewer players, and Japan has disciplined rules about how its armed forces respond in situations. This would draw the baseline down.\n    \u2022 Clearly, the distribution is extremely skewed \u2013 0 deaths is most likely by a country mile; 1 death is far less likely; 2 deaths is far less likely than that; and so on. So, we have to imagine, if we draw a number at random from this distribution, what\u2019s the chance that we\u2019ll hit a number above 0? My gut feeling is that the ~5% from above (roughly 1 deaths every 20 years) seems about right. \n    \u2022 I\u2019m going to go with the 5%. I will change my mind if:\n        \u25e6 I discover other military deaths in the region since ~1990.\n        \u25e6 There are any relevant news stories \u2013 I will monitor, but I\u2019m not sure what signs would give an indication of an impending military death that wouldn\u2019t have already caused a death by the time it makes the news."], [28166, "2019-01-03T02:20:27Z", [0.07], ""], [63963, "2019-01-02T23:01:07Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2019-01-02T20:58:36Z", [0.0], ""], [63893, "2019-01-02T04:07:12Z", [0.03], ""], [1034, "2019-01-01T09:35:03Z", [0.0], ""], [1333, "2018-12-31T20:55:38Z", [0.09], ""], [28997, "2018-12-31T17:16:46Z", [0.04], ""], [691, "2018-12-31T12:58:50Z", [0.02], ""], [60463, "2018-12-31T11:47:10Z", [0.3], ""], [31251, "2018-12-29T12:55:57Z", [0.03], ""], [31251, "2018-12-29T12:52:41Z", [0.03], ""], [63854, "2018-12-28T23:53:35Z", [0.03], "as roughly per consensus.
