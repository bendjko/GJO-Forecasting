I used the Wayback Machine to access the Charge Map website back to February 2016. This data shows that indeed the number of new charging stations has been on an upward (although volatile) trend.  I fit a linear regression to this data. The coefficient shows that with every passing month, the number of new charging stations has been rising by an average of 4.4 with a standard error of 0.8.

[1] Using this number, we arrive at ~ 8,807 by mid-December.\n- We can also model with a growth rate. Average growth rate was 4.1%. Using this number, we arrive at ~9,487 by mid-December. However, the growth rate seems to have increased over that time period by about 22% per month on average. I don't put much stock in that, however, since it fluctuated a lot over that time.\n-  I don't expect new countries to join. UK leaving the EU immediately with a hard Brexit is perhaps 10%. The UK represents 18% of the current total.  So I'd want to substract 1.8% from the calculated total: Thus, we arrive at 8,648 and 9,316 respectively.\n- Standard deviation was about 100 CCS of stations per month. Prediction is my informed gut judgment based on the above reasoning.

I also now think there is a significant chance of seeing more than 10k charging stations considering that many big players are entering the arena and <7k is very unlikely. Generally speaking, I made these assumptions for different project lengths about which percentage of the planned capacity will be finished in 2019\n2019: 50%\n2020: 30%\n2021: 20%\n2022 or above: 10% These reflect that planning is typically much too optimistic and that past projects had a pretty bad track record from what I could tell. Also, there is likely to be acceleration in most projects as experience is gained, operations scaled up, and so on.

The graph in the link indicates a noticeable uptick since about Oct 2017, and a rough estimate would be about 130/mo over the past 15 months, with a pretty steady average before that of about 80/mo.  To break 10K, an average of 358 per month would have to be installed. To break 9K would require 274/mo, 8K would require 190/mo, and less than 7K would require 107/mo or less. Given the trend so far, I think between 7-8K is the most realistic bucket, with a possibility to get to the 8-9K bucket based on the recent upticks. Over 9K will be a challenge without a noticeable increase, and over 10K is, at the moment, not really feasible as it requires double the current installation rate."]]}
