I've been seeing the headlines, just as all of you have about Kasich pulling ahead (http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/oh/ohio_republican_presidential_primary-4077.html#polls), but there's something about this that doesn't quite feel right to me. Even 538's preview of tomorrow (http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/florida-ohio-republican-primary-preview/) doesn't seem to really give us any new/extra information about Ohio. PredictIt (https://www.predictit.org/Market/1942/Who-will-win-the-Ohio-Republican-primary) seems to think that this is 70/30 in favo[u]r of Kasich. I, on the other hand, think that Trump will win. In re-reading that 538 preview, they talk about how Kasich performed well in Kentucky/Michigan on those counties that border Ohio. I'm not really sure what they're talking about because I checked all the counties that border Ohio in those two states and, as long as I've read it correctly, Trump won every single one of them. Every. Single. One. Of course, Ohio is a different ballgame (Kasich is the Governor, for Pete's sake), but I took a quick peek at the 2012 GOP primary (http://elections.nytimes.com/2012/primaries/states/ohio). In it, I tried to find those areas in the state where Trump has done well. Let me rephrase, I looked for areas in the state with demographics that Trump's done well with in other states. This article helped with that (http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/13/upshot/the-geography-of-trumpism.html), but from what I recall of watching returns: white, poor, and uneducated, are three of the big ones.

Trump does not have many endorsements, but endorsements have had less effect on this GOP contest than in the past. Trump has pretty consistently performed better than his Polls Plus ranking (but not quite as good as his pure Polls ranking). In the past, I have been averaging the two for Trump. That would give Kasich about a 59% chance. I elevated this earlier after Rubio told his followers to vote for Kasich in Ohio.

But it's certainly time (for me, at any rate) to dispense with the fiction that either Cruz or Rubio has a chance worthy of the name. The polls have never favored either in this state, and they now project a less than 1% chance that either will win[a]. Furthermore, neither Rubio nor Cruz have especially interesting advantages in Ohio (i.e., they don't hold elected office there, they weren't born there, they haven't lived there or gone to university there, they don't run businesses that have large interests there, etc.), and Rubio has even told his supporters to vote for Kasich[b]! But the Kasich and Trump match-up presents us with a real head-scratcher. The aggregate of polls suggests the two are in a dead heat[c], though when one takes endorsements into consideration, Kasich has about a 2-to-1 advantage[d]. Moreover, Kasich has a lot of infrastructure advantages in Ohio, which is not surprising given his job title. For example: \"An unusual arrangement with the state Republican party and a supportive super PAC loaded with former top aides from the governor's office has allowed Kasich to lay an extensive groundwork ahead of the March 15 primary. 'We're running a truncated, mini-gubernatorial campaign in a month,' Matt Borges, the Ohio Republican Party chairman, said in an interview. 'Do I think all of those things make up a couple of points? Yes.' Kasich trailed Drumpf in Ohio by 6 points in the most recent CNN/ORC poll, 41% to 35%. But a Fox News poll released Wednesday showed Kasich ahead by 5 points. The reality, state officials say, is that the race is largely a toss-up at this point. 'We know where we have a lot of work to do,' Borges said. 'You have a governor with a 77% approval rating. We've gotta remind Ohioans why they like him, what they like about him.' Internally, Kasich's team is encouraged by what they see happening on the ground. Save for a series of ad buys and a few appearances in the state, they've seen little else in the form of an organization from Drumpf in the state. Marco Rubio, focused solely on survival in Florida, and Ted Cruz, aren't planning any stops in the state. In the past few primary contests, including in Michigan, late breaking voters have trended toward Kasich, not Drumpf. A race that becomes essentially a one-on-one battle with Drumpf, with a full week of a coordinated blitz to hammer home why people in the state approved of Kasich to begin with, provides a clear opportunity to rise, aides and supporters say\"[e]. That's a somewhat one-sided take, but Kasich's underlying strengths in Ohio are pretty clear. It's true: Trump has been running a lot of negative adds very recently[f], but they appear to involve little that Ohioans haven't heard during Kasich's gubernatorial campaigns here, save the claim that Kasich is an absentee landlord. Will that work? Unemployment in Ohio is 5.7%, and it's been experiencing economic growth over the last few years: \"the state had a projected GDP of $526.1 billion in 2013, up from 517.1 in 2012, and up from 501.3 in 2011\"[g]. If the state were under water, then the absentee landlord charge might sting, but that's not the case. -- [a] http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/ohio-republican/\n[b] http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-03-11/rubio-tells-ohio-supporters-to-back-kasich-in-bid-to-block-trump - though it's worth noting that at least some are resisting; that won't help Rubio, but it might hurt Kasich, see http://www.politico.com/story/2016/03/marco-rubio-ohio-strategic-voting-220666\n[c] http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/ohio-republican/#polls-only\n[d] http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/ohio-republican\n[e] http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/11/politics/john-kasich-ohio-donald-trump/index.html\n[f] http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/11/politics/donald-trump-john-kasich-tv-attack-ad-ohio/index.html\n[g] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Ohio\n"], [64, "2016-03-13T01:03:18Z", [0.0, 0.8, 0.0, 0.2], ""], [17357, "2016-03-13T00:18:43Z", [0.42, 0.13, 0.07, 0.38], ""], [14253, "2016-03-13T00:05:46Z", [0.0, 0.4, 0.0, 0.6], ""], [1269, "2016-03-12T23:31:43Z", [0.0, 0.58, 0.0, 0.42], ""], [11885, "2016-03-12T22:10:06Z", [0.0, 0.75, 0.0, 0.25], ""], [3895, "2016-03-12T22:05:41Z", [0.0, 0.57, 0.0, 0.43], ""], [16071, "2016-03-12T21:54:40Z", [0.0, 0.65, 0.0, 0.35], ""], [15794, "2016-03-12T21:32:09Z", [0.0, 0.51, 0.0, 0.49], ""], [17098, "2016-03-12T21:20:12Z", [0.1, 0.5, 0.0, 0.4], ""], [18292, "2016-03-12T20:59:28Z", [0.1, 0.46, 0.1, 0.34], "Kasich will win the presidential candidate."], [17829, "2016-03-12T20:29:36Z", [0.0, 0.75, 0.0, 0.25], ""], [21937, "2016-03-12T20:28:15Z", [0.06, 0.54, 0.02, 0.38], "Trump supporters didn't get their daily dose of Trump as the rally was cancelled and it shows a certain weakness that will make them look at what Kasich has to offer, this will lead to a small number of them ditching Trump in favor of Kasich.

This is the fundamental question from my perspective. Generally speaking,  in the past, this state has proved to be a voter block of sound, clear minded people albeit, with a conservative bent. Due in great part, I suppose, to its broad based economy. It too however, has lost momentum, relative to other states in growth terms. That said, Kasich still maintains strong support, so it makes the vote v/ close.  The easy answer, is yes Kasich wins but, just barely. The harder question now I think is : does  overall momentum, flow of information to the voting public, a clear voter discontent & desire to alter the status quo  in the state all add up to take DT into the winners circle here ? These are all variables/uncertainties that aren't readily quantifiable, especially at this late stage.  NB: above-mentioned Q: on whether Ohio voters are willing to cast their vote for someone they know will not become the GOP's Presidential nominee. There is reasonable probability Ohioans will surprisingly vote for being reasonable. Not tossing their votes away to Kasich ( although well respected).

It seems like his vote share stays the same from Republicans to Independents. On the other hand, Kasich's vote share increases among independents compared to his vote share among Republicans. This suggests that contrary to my prior belief, the Ohio open primary may actually favor Kasich.  - The latest PPP poll has Trump up 38% to 35% on Kasich, but coupled with the fact that this is Kasich's home state, that he is its governor, and that his ground game should be much better organized than Trump's, he may have the edge. - 538 (http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/ohio-republican/) has Kasich 37.9% to Trump 35.7% in its polls-plus model, which probably is a more sophisticated version of the above argument. Note that it's polls plus model has tended to underestimate Kasich's vote share and to be pretty close on Trump's.  - Nevertheless, pending further polling, I'm staying at 55/45 for now.

John Kasich has surged to an all-time high job approval rating among voters in his home state of Ohio, according to the results of the latest Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday. More than six in 10\u201462 percent\u2014said they approve of the job their governor is doing. Kasich, a GOP presidential candidate, drew just 29 percent disapproval. The numbers are in line with Kasich's previous high of 61 percent to 28 percent in August, still within the statistical margin of error. ~~~~ COMMENT: The one thing I think that hurts Kasich is how far away the vote in Ohio is from today. And more importantly, how many other states there are between now and then. I'm pretty sure that Kasich will win NONE of the states between now and Ohio -- not even Michigan.
