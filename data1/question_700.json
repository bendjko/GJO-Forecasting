Thus, as it is uncertain whether an election announcement will come from British Prime Minster Teresa May before the end of September, \ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeffI completely disregarded its influence on the answer to this question. I posit that elections will not be held before the end date of this forecast, as historically, the time between the announcement of snap elections and the date for the elections is greater than 12 days, the time left in the month of September. When Teresa May held snap elections in 2017, she announced the snap election approximately two months before the election was held. (https://www.businessinsider.com/heres-why-the-prime-minister-of-the-uk-has-the-power-to-call-a-snap-election-2017-4). Teresa May provided ample time for the parties to select candidates and for the candidates to be considered. It can be assumed that she will afford a similar length of time between a snap election and its announcement. Similarly, when Tony Blair called for snap elections in 2005, he provided over three weeks of time between its announcement and the election itself. (http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/04/13/uk.blair.manifesto/) Additionally, if Teresa May resigns, the election process will similarly take over three weeks as it did when David Cameron resigned in 2016.

The view seems to be that Boris's leadership bid will not now be until the Conference. \nThe EU that dislikes Boris even more strongly than the UK general public does and most of his fellow Conservative MPs do, has been sowing confusion very successfully  in the UK media who seem to have confused Barnier's remarks about the UK EU Withdrawal Agreement (aka The Brexit Agreement) being about the UK EU Future Trade Deal. Barniers has not suggested that the EU is likely to agree to the Chequers Proposal in the next 6 to 8 weeks if both sides are realistic, he was referring to the Withdrawal Agreement which according to the EU timetable was to have been agreed in October (2017 not 2018) and was agreed in principal on 8th Dec 2017.  So if the Withdrawal Agreement has taken at least 3 times longer than planned, we should expect to see a trade deal agreement some time around autumn 2021.

Any contest for PM would probably take at least 2 weeks to organise after Mrs May was deposed, and it would probably take a week to depose Mrs May. So really there is only time if the process started in the next few days. This is in spite of the Brexit process seeming to be hitting a brick wall, as the Conservative Party and the Brexiteers seem to have differing views on how to proceed, let alone who should lead them. The Chequers Plan seems to succeeded in uniting  the public, MPs and the EU in that almost everyone agrees they don't want it. Some Brexiteer MPs want No Deal (aka WTO rules) in spite of the WTO pointing out the UK is very unlikely to get agreement from other WTO members in time for March 2019. Its also almost certain that MPs would block a No Deal. Other Brexiteers are still demanding that the UK negotiate a Canada + type deal, claiming that force of will and belief will produce a magic solution to the Irish Border problem. There is no sign of either the UK Government trying to negotiate a Canada + type FTA, or the EU accepting that it can solve the Irish Border Issue, and even if there was it would seem very unlikely that it could be full negotiated  by December 2020 (the end of the implementation period).\nThe Chequers Plan seems dead in the water. Which leaves  Norway + (EEA + EFTA  + EU Single Market) either as an interim solution until another FTA can be negotiated that would solve the Irish Border Problem (i.e. the Magic Potion is found) or as a permanent state for the UK. The final option is that the UK changes its mind and stays in the EU after all. \nWe know that in 2016 48% of voters then wanted to Remain and 52% wanted to Leave. There is no evidence that less than 48% would now prefer to Remain (and Polls show that it appears that over 50% would now prefer to Remain) we can assume that not more (and probably a lots less) than 52% want to Leave. Of the (up to) 52% wanting Leave we know that there are at least four completely different type of Leave that are supported, with many Leave supporters saying that if they can't have the version of Leave they prefer, they would to not Leave at all. (e.g. David Davis and Boris Johnson saying that getting the Chequers plan type of Brexit is worse than Remaining, while others say not getting the Chequers plan Brexit would be a disaster). The polls show that if asked what outcome they prefer a lot more people would prefer to Remain than any variety of Leave is supported. \n "], [705, "2018-09-03T13:46:33Z", [0.01, 0.01, 0.0, 0.98], ""], [58853, "2018-09-03T02:58:08Z", [0.05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.95], ""], [35683, "2018-09-02T22:09:57Z", [0.08, 0.0, 0.0, 0.92], ""], [35683, "2018-09-02T21:57:14Z", [0.08, 0.0, 0.0, 0.92], ""], [60747, "2018-09-02T21:45:17Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [60725, "2018-09-02T18:52:17Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.0, 0.95], ""], [10837, "2018-09-02T17:12:37Z", [0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.9], ""], [60666, "2018-09-02T14:12:31Z", [0.2, 0.0, 0.05, 0.75], ""], [60598, "2018-09-02T13:42:40Z", [0.01, 0.0, 0.0, 0.99], ""], [691, "2018-09-02T11:18:10Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [54996, "2018-09-02T11:10:47Z", [0.15, 0.15, 0.15, 0.55], ""], [37893, "2018-09-02T09:41:34Z", [0.2, 0.05, 0.0, 0.75], ""], [20156, "2018-09-01T19:53:42Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [52343, "2018-09-01T15:24:13Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [47482, "2018-09-01T14:04:02Z", [0.01, 0.01, 0.0, 0.98], "Affirming.

While the bulk of parliamentarians are Remainers, the currently highly fragmented nature of parliament, which is still structured on party lines means that the more extreme Brexiteers (i.e. those preferring to leave without a deal) have a hugely disproportionate say within the Conservative party. Essentially they can threaten the prime minister with her downfall by challenging her leadership pretty much on a whim. It is they who are currently driving the process. In light of her severely depleted political capital (she must be hanging on by her fingertips) she is acutely vulnerable. As her Chequers plan of last week is now in tatters, it is not clear where she goes from here as it will not make it through parliament. This leaves Teresa May in a significant bind: she can\u2019t move forward (where to? She has just given it her best shot), but neither can she move back (either to a more Remain stance or a more Brexiteer stance as the opposing stance immediately undermines her; her fate is no longer in her control).  So, in order to neutralize the really rather few \u2018No Deal\u2019 Brexiteers, parliament has to cohere in some form. One way of doing this would be via a government of national unity; another way would be under a Conservative leader (as it is they who are currently in power) who more genuinely is able to bring a more acceptable deal to party than Teresa May was able to.  So the possible options facing the country are:  1) Teresa May carries on as is - to nowhere. As things are she is not going to get her plan through parliament so this seems a pointless strategy. She may just hang on in the hope that something changes over the summer (to speculate on what would take too long here). However, because she is a very resilient woman I am now suggesting there is a low to medium (30%) probability of her carrying on until October.  2) Teresa May realises that she is at a dead-end and resigns to be replaced by either a Conservative Brexiteer (which will be followed by a Conservative meltdown as Remainer Conservatives won't stand for it so are likely to vote against him or her in parliament leading to an election and probable Labour government) or Remainer (in which case more of the same as under May, say for another 6 months); a Brexiteer replacement is unlikely as there isn't enough support for one. I think there is a quite high probability (65%) probability of this happening.   3) May may be forced from power if there are elections should the Conservative Brexiteers bring down the government which, counter-productively, it looks like they are increasingly inclined to do should she not bend to their will, which she cant knowing that any deal which appeals to them wont making it through parliament. But bringing her down would be counter-productive as it would lead to a Labour government and the Conservative Brexiteers would lose control of the process, so it would seem unlikely. But as a last resort, who knows? I wouldn't rule out Labour promising them a full Brexit in order to bring this about \u2013 I have seen greater treachery in politics and for Brexiteers this is an existential issue. I have lowered the probability of this happening to 5%. Low, but possible.  Below are the two outcomes that could lead follow from the above scenarios: 1) A government of national unity is formed which looks unlikely as Labour front bench are unlikely to support the idea as is Teresa May as it would imply a lack of confidence in her leadership; so, this is only likely to happen after Teresa May as gone.  2) A referendum is offered with two options: a hard Brexit or soft Brexit; remaining is no longer an option. A referendum is only likely to happen after Teresa May has gone. My best guess is that Teresa May resigns (pushed or jumps) and a Remainer Conservative takes her place ushering in either a government of national unity and/or referendum. The only circumstance under which she is likely to stay is if parliament were to rally round in the belief that No Deal is increasingly probable. As the clock is ticking, something will give very soon. My belief is that as May is the blocking point, she will move or be moved (thanks to those grey men in grey suits). \n"], [28563, "2018-07-19T12:06:45Z", [0.1, 0.01, 0.01, 0.88], ""], [32872, "2018-07-19T11:45:36Z", [0.04, 0.01, 0.0, 0.95], ""], [691, "2018-07-19T11:12:53Z", [0.01, 0.0, 0.0, 0.99], ""], [30878, "2018-07-18T21:03:15Z", [0.65, 0.05, 0.0, 0.3], "Comment deleted on Jul 18, 2018 09:03PM UTC"], [601, "2018-07-18T20:59:22Z", [0.03, 0.07, 0.0, 0.9], ""], [30878, "2018-07-18T20:47:09Z", [0.8, 0.15, 0.0, 0.05], "Today, Nicholas Soames, a very senior politician, has called for a Government of national unity (according to Anna Soubry on BBC Radio 4 this morning) which is interesting: it tells us the mess the Conservatives and Labour are in, and the gridlock that parliament is in.

Hence the probabilities below reflect numbers \"here and now\", and reflect a narrower window for those numbers to change in future. WILL THERE BE A LEADERSHIP CHALLENGE? \nNo challenge so far, despite May just losing a vote on the floor, means that we can be more confident that there are NOT the numbers in the Tory party room to spill May ... and everyone knows it.

May\u2019s leadership has been precarious since she unveiled her proposed new Brexit negotiating strategy at her Chequers residence and detailed it in a white paper last week.

Unless this changes, a challenge is unlikely;  - that said, May's Brexit plan is decidedly unpopular with Conservative voters. If it's voted in Parliament, it will have a hard time. Labor won't help, as they want elections. The Lib Dems will probably support the plan, but they are too few. The Scottish National Party is the wild card - they may well support the plan in exchange for some concessions (e.g., a definite second independence referendum after Brexit), but their numbers may not be enough neither.  - yet I don't see a Tory politician willing to challenge May. It begins to dawn on them all that Brexit would be quite a dislocation, and no one wants to be carrying the red wooden box (where the ministers traditionally  carry government documents) while this unfolds. This is why Johnson and (perhaps) Davis left - to be able to say later \"Brexit is a disaster because the government did not follow my ideas\". Don't see any Tories supporting a Labor no-confidence vote either, as they would be branded \"traitors\" and the outcome would be worse for them than under May's plan.       - so under what circumstances may May leave before Oct 1: (1) resignation: if Parliament (or the EU) reject her plan, she may well have had enough. No confidence in my proposals - find someone else to clean the mess, please. Probability: 5% (2) A no-confidence vote in Parliament: some in SNP or Lib Dems may support Labor if they propose a vote.

Thus they are unlikely to launch a challenge until they are reasonably sure of having the numbers (or at least reasonably sure that the numbers are not going to get any better for them). Some numbers around pro-Brexit Tories contemplating a leadership challenge?  (All are my \"best guess\" ...) Less than 48 members (p= 0.10) -> insufficient to launch a leadership challenge.\n48 to 100-ish members (p= 0.60) -> could launch a challenge, but would certainly lose, which would be self-defeating.\n100-ish to 158 members (p= 0.25) -> within spitting distance of winning a challenge and might consider launching a challenge then gathering enough support to win a close ballot.\n159 or more members (p= 0.05) -> will launch a challenge ASAP, and be confident of winning. The 100-158 bracket will more likely than not launch a challenge (p= 0.65).  The perception may well be that, though the odds of tipping May are not good, they are unlikely to improve within the next twelve months, so better to strike now rather than give the appearance that May is \"getting away with it\" with her attempt at a soft Brexit.  However, they are unlikely to win (p= 0.30). Putting this together ...\n10%: Weak support, no challenge possible.\n60%: Weak support, challenge deferred pending better chances.\n11% (0.25 * 0.65 * 0.70): Moderate support, decision  to launch challenge, which is unsuccessful.\n5% (0.25 * 0.65 * 0.30): Moderate support, decision to launch challenge, which is successful -> YES, CONSERVATIVE.\n9% (0.25 * 0.35): Moderate support, decision to NOT launch challenge.\n5%: Strong support, successful challenge launched -> YES, CONSERVATIVE. Overall, that is 10% that May will fall to a leadership challenge in the near future. WILL THERE BE A VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE? A SUCCESSFUL ONE?\nIf the pro-Brexit Tories sense that they fail to have the numbers to launch a leadership challenge, or if they launch one but then fail (combined p= 0.90), they may instead offer to support Labour in a vote of no confidence ... which will only need 3 supporters.  One one hand this is LIKELY, because it only requires 3 of the 315-odd Tories to defect.  This is much easier to arrange than having 49 Tories supporting a challenge, or 158 Tories voting to dump May. On the other hand, this is UNLIKELY because this is card is more effective as a threat than being used in play: a VoNC (if sustained) would result in an election that Labour would almost certainly win, and the would result in an outcome (from the Brexiteers POV) that is far less desirable than May's current proposal. Given May seems like the sort to NOT give in to threats, if 3 Tories defect to support a Labour VoNC, May is likely to stare them down, and regain the House's confidence within the required 14 days. So, the question really is - if May is NOT overthrown, what is the chance that 3 Tories will support a Labour VoNC ... AND then continue to withhold confidence from May until the government falls ... AND have the election held before 1 October??  Best guess I have is 4%, in which case -> YES, LABOUR."], [38319, "2018-07-11T03:13:58Z", [0.04, 0.01, 0.0, 0.95], "Comment deleted on Jul 11, 2018 03:55AM UTC"], [1646, "2018-07-10T20:03:35Z", [0.05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.95], ""], [14493, "2018-07-10T18:27:12Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "Most of the comments seem to be focused on (a) do enough Conservative MPs want to get rid of May (b) do enough Conservative MPs dislike May's negotiating position for Brexit.  What seems to be missing is what would be gained by the Brexit dreaming MPs by changing the PM? As May has realised is there is no Brexit possible that would not cross her red lines, they simply contradict each other. Its not a matter of what people want to do by shear force of will power, some contradictions are simple contradictions. The Irish border status is enshrined in an International Treaty that has been ratified by referendum. The UK government cannot just walk away from the treaty, Mrs May has made it a red line that she will stand by the treaty. The Brexiteers say are prepared to walk away from the EU without a deal and trade on WTO terms. If they do that they will have to follow WTO rules. One of these rules is that every country is required to ensure that it has secure customs borders. So the UK (which currently is not even a member of the WTO) and the EU therefore cannot continue to have no border between Ireland and the UK. To have the current Irish border arrangement requires that both sides are in the same Customs Union and have identical rules (a Single Market). So simply put, the red lines of being outside a Customs Union and Single Market between the UK and EU are not compatible with the status of the Irish border as described by the Good Friday Agreement.  Unpicking the Good Friday Agreement is not a job that any candidate for UK PM looks to be up for. So the only form of Brexit possible will be one where the UK remains in a Customs Unions and Single Market with the EU, or as the EU has suggested where the two parts of Ireland are united economically and the NI is divided from the rest of the UK, but this idea crosses another UK red line.  As Boris put it so clearly the Brexit Dream Is Dying, but its dying because his \"cake and eat it\" Brexit was always just a dream, a fantasy a mere figment of a fevered imagination. Its a dream like making America Great Again by taxing imports.  Boris is wrong about the dream being suffocated by needless self doubt, it is being killed by the cold logic of reality. It is being killed by the Brexiteers refusal to take into account the facts.    \n"], [37379, "2018-07-10T15:44:42Z", [0.01, 0.0, 0.0, 0.99], "It looks like nobody wants to caught holding Theresa May's Brexit bag come March 2019."], [1389, "2018-07-10T15:13:03Z", [0.2, 0.0, 0.0, 0.8], ""], [32100, "2018-07-10T11:58:26Z", [0.05, 0.01, 0.0, 0.94], ""], [34724, "2018-07-10T10:17:58Z", [0.14, 0.01, 0.0, 0.85], "Trying to find the right balance between reacting to recent events and not overreacting to recent events!"], [28414, "2018-07-10T09:56:49Z", [0.01, 0.0, 0.0, 0.99], ""], [29646, "2018-07-10T06:26:41Z", [0.45, 0.0, 0.0, 0.55], "Only giving May slightly better than even odds after news of the Foreign Secretary\u2019s resignation.

What happens next? Following are some scenarios. REVOLT?:  May\u2019s survival will depend on keeping other senior cabinet ministers in the government. All eyes are on Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who is due to speak at a diplomatic conference later on Monday, and Environment Secretary Michael Gove. When Davis was asked if he would join some other lawmakers in calling for May to stand down, Davis told BBC Radio: \u201cI won\u2019t be one of them. I won\u2019t be encouraging people to do that, I think it\u2019s the wrong thing to do.\u201d The resignation of Davis\u2019s deputy, Steve Baker, is a serious loss for May: Baker is widely respected among Brexit-supporting lawmakers. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of a group of Brexit supporters in the Conservative Party, signaled that he would not vote for May\u2019s plan, apparently agreed by the cabinet at Chequers on Friday, if it came to a vote in parliament.\n. . . \n\u201cA wider rebellion, a leadership challenge, early elections and possibly another major shift in the Brexit strategy (either way) cannot be ruled out,\u201d Citi said in a note to clients. If Davis and Baker are the only major losses from the government over her plan for \u201ca business-friendly\u201d Brexit that proposes \u201ca free trade area for goods\u201d with the EU, then May will be much safer.\n. . .\nSterling rallied on Monday as traders bet that the resignation of Davis would not endanger the prime minister and instead focused on the government\u2019s newly-announced plan that markets believe makes a \u201csoft Brexit\u201d more likely.\n. . . \nEver since May\u2019s botched bet on a snap election in 2017 lost her party its majority in parliament, she has been vulnerable but there are few candidates who could unite her divided party.\n. . . \nConservative lawmakers also worry that leadership election so close to Brexit - due to take place on March 29, 2019 - would embolden Labour and increase pressure for another election which could delay Brexit. A leadership challenge can be triggered if 15 percent of members of parliament in May\u2019s Conservative Party write a letter to the chairman of the party\u2019s so-called \u201c1922 committee\u201d. The Conservatives currently have 316 members of parliament (MPs) so 48 of them would need to write such letters to challenge May. For many Conservative supporters of Brexit, though, May has sold out and they do not want her to lead the party into the next election, which is due on May 5, 2022. DISORDERLY BREXIT:  Under this scenario, May\u2019s government either falls or fails to reach a Brexit deal with the EU. A precursor to this could be the government losing the vote it has promised parliament on the final exit deal. Whilst that vote is not binding, May\u2019s position would be badly weakened if parliament rejected her deal.\n. . . \nANOTHER REFERENDUM?:  May has repeatedly ruled out another referendum, but about 100,000 supporters of the EU marched through central London last month to demand that the British government hold a final public vote on the terms of Brexit.\n. . . \nFormer Prime Minister Tony Blair has repeatedly called for reversing Brexit, echoing other critics such as French President Emmanuel Macron and billionaire investor George Soros, who have suggested that Britain could still change its mind. In one of the most tumultuous periods in recent British political history, there have been four major elections in the past four years: the Scottish independence referendum of 2014, the 2015 UK election, the 2016 Brexit referendum and the snap election called by May last year.\n"], [47812, "2018-07-09T16:10:36Z", [0.12, 0.03, 0.0, 0.85], "Ministers are leaving quickly\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44770847"], [37800, "2018-07-09T15:59:42Z", [0.32, 0.15, 0.0, 0.53], ""], [37488, "2018-07-09T15:29:23Z", [0.08, 0.0, 0.0, 0.92], "\"...Dr Simon Usherwood, a reader in politics at the University of Surrey, says there are two questions to consider. \u201cAre there enough Tory MPs out there who are sufficiently upset by the situation to lodge a request?

That suggests this is his way of expressing unhappiness without triggering further discontent.

He wants a policy change rather than for her to leave office.  \"On the second question, there is no clear alternative or successor to Mrs May should a leadership election be triggered so MPs might want to think twice before rocking the boat.  \"What is Mrs May thinking?

The majority of MPs recognise that Mrs May is very weak and that Brexit is going very badly. For almost all of them their objective is to find a way out of the Brexit promises and red lines that will damage themselves the least and put the blame for Brexit failure on other people and hopefully other political parties. Getting rid of Mrs May in the next 12 weeks would not help any of them, because that would risk the people seen to be getting rid of Mrs May as the people who were stopping the great Brexit deal that is repeatedly promised to an increasing disbelieving public.  The Brexit voting public are also hoping someone or something will kill off Brexit. The polls show hardly anyone expects Brexit will bring them any benefits, but the polls also show that few Brexit voters want to admit they were wrong to vote for Brexit.  So the main Brexit supporting MPs are sticking to the line that only the most extreme form of Brexit is really Brexit and that any compromise is not true Brexit. They know that this would be very bad for the economy and that it would probably take 15 or 20 years for the UK to adjust. The \"have cake and eat it\" deal with the EU is most unlikely (and always was). WTO rules would be bad - assuming that the WTO still exists. They know it. So they want Parliament to block Brexit. Specifically they want the Labour Party to block Brexit (obviously it would need the support of a few Conservative MPs or for the DUP to withdraw its support for Mrs May). Their reasoning is that in a year or two they can claim that Brexit would have been great if only the Labour Party had not been so undemocratic as to block the will of the people.  The Labour Party and the anti-Brexit Conservatives can see that the Brexiteers want them (the Labour Party and anti-Brexit MPs) to be blamed for preventing the glorious Brexit the public were told about, so they are not willing to fall into that trap.  Mrs May's (and David Davis's) strategy seems to be to give the appearance of having negotiations with the EU, without making any progress or even discussing option that are feasible. If this goes no until January or February 2019 there will no time to agree any bespoke deal. Then the options will be to go over the cliff or accept a deal that can take existing structures (i.e. the EEA, Single Market, EFTA Court, the Four Freedoms etc.) or just remain in the EU. Parliament would not support jumping off the cliff. The choice would be the EEA/EFTA option that is a compromise, but that the Brexiteer MPs have already said would be worse than staying in the EU or actually staying in the EU. Logically staying in the EU would appear to be the sensible option, but clearly logic has little appeal to the Brexiteers. At this point the blame game really cranks up. Was it the Brexiteers misleading voters as to what was possible? The EU blocking the UK by not offering them a \"cake and eat it\" Brexit? Was is anti-democratic Remoaners? Was is Mrs May and David Davis being incompetent in the negotiations?   So I think Mrs May will be kicked out only when its clear her version of Brexit cannot be agreed with the EU, but its obvious that there is no time for the UK to choose a new PM, adopt a new Brexit strategy and get that agreed with the EU. This is why Mrs May is desperately asking EU governments to press Barnier not to just reject her latest complex unworkable iteration of a plan, but to keep pretending to negotiate until time has run out.

She is clearly panicking. Her latest announcement of more money for the NHS partly funded by the Brexit Dividend is evidence of her panic. As many commentators are pointing out this appears to be a significant unfunded spending commitment, just the sort of irresponsible action that Conservative Governments are supposed to not do. It will almost certainly come back to bite her.  It brings up again the Boris Johnson claim that there would be a \u00a3350 million a week Brexit Dividend, which has been shown up to be complete nonsense (the \u00a3350m is a gross figure that excludes the UK rebate, excludes payments paid to people/organizations in the UK  that would need to be funded by the UK, and excludes payments for the cost of EU institutions that the wishes to remain in.) I would imagine the media will point out that as Boris claimed the Brexit Divided will be \u00a3350 million a week and May's increased NHS spending only reaches \u00a3384 million a week by 2023/4, the logical conclusion would be that the most the shortfall would be is \u00a334 million a week by 2023. If on the other hand BJ was not telling the whole truth with his \u00a3350 million a week, the Chancellor of the Exchequer will have have find a rather larger figure than \u00a334 million a week. Most likely the real figure is going to be more like \u00a3200 million a week, which will have to come from increased borrowing or from tax rises. Either way it screws up the Conservatives pledge to reduce the national debt and not put up taxes.   So this unthought out idea could (a) further discredit BJ (May might think this a good thing, but the Conservative Party will not) (b) upset the right of party who want low taxes and low borrowing (c) the \"responsible\" wing of the party who want policies that have been thought thru. The benefit to May of spending more on the NHS, which is what most of the public want, will be lost in the arguments that will now arise.

It's not clear if they will swallow their anger or trigger the process to vote to get rid of her.  If no progress is made this month (and it appears to be very unlikely that it will) MPs could give up on TM. If she makes it to the end of July she will probable hold on until October. It appears that almost all MPs and the media are agreed that the Bexit process is going very badly and that no good Brexit is possible and they are starting to be more concerned about long term damage control. The most likely outcomes are a Brexit in name only or abandoning Brexit. The Soft Brexit/Remainers aim seems to be to steer towards a very soft Brexit as the only Brexit deal on offer that will not result in total chaos and try to force the Pro-Brexit/Leavers into having to admit that the type of Brexit they wanted is not possible without economic melt down, The Pro-Brexit/Leavers (I assume) can see as well as everyone else that the version of Brexit they sold voters was never realistic, so their aim now is to try and convince the public that the failure to even fully describe what a credible successful Brexit would consist of, is not because it does not exist, but because the Soft-Brexit/Remainers have sabotaged their plans. So both sides are waiting for the other side to be the ones that call the whole thing off.  With the benefit of hindsight TM might have been better to approached Brexit by stating that step one would need to be re-negotiate the Good Friday Agreement. If all parties in Ireland (north and south) where persuaded that a normal international border (and normal citizenship) was in their interest (or that a United Ireland was what they wanted). It might be possible, but it would probably take a long time and cost the UK a lot of money. TM could have strung the negotiations out for 5 or 10 years by which time Brexit would have forgotten.

I am not sure if he does not support the Mrs Mays's Customs idea because (like the EU and almost everyone else) he does not think it workable, or because he is now a hard Brexit supporter. \nIn one sense it Mrs May's Customs options are irrelevant, because they have already been rejected as impractical (magic thinking) by the EU. While Mrs May insists that the border with Ireland will remain as it is, and that the UK will be doing free trade with 3rd countries once outside the EU, it appears to be impossible to see any way to achieve her objectives. \nThere is now a three way split in the Conservative Party and any one of these groups could force Mrs May out. The Hard Brexit group insists on nothing that looks like a Customs Union (and Single Market) with the EU. It has no solution to the Irish Border (except possible scrap the Good Friday agreement which created the open border).\nThe Soft Brexit group see the solution as staying in Customs Union and Single Market with the consequence of not having 3rd party free trade deals (but they could do deal to give services access to 3rd countries).\nThe Rump group want some leadership and a practical solution found to Brexit. As the Brexit negotiations fail to produce any progress the Rump might decide a new leader is needed. \nI detect a hint that the Hard Brexit group are preparing their excuses for the failure of Brexit. Failure in their eyes would be to deliver a Brexit that did not have 3rd country trade deals, but if the choice is between the free trade deals (aka \"getting a packet of crisps one day\") and scrapping the open border and screwing up trade with Europe (aka \"a three course dinner today\") the Rump would prefer the \"three course meal\". The Hard Brexiteers are threatening to vote against a final Brexit Deal that does not given them what they promised (but that is impossible to deliver). This would allow them to claim that Parliament had betrayed Brexit and that if Mrs May had only done what they demanded the (impossible) Brexit they said people voted for would have happened. In other words they are trying to save their credibility for after Brexit when it fails to deliver. Getting rid of Mrs May would not help them, if one of the Hard Brexiteers were PM there still would be no way they could deliver Brexit as outlined by them. \nOne of the many ironies of Brexit is that the Hard Brexiteers sold Brexit as \"bringing back power to Parliament\", to avoid giving Parliament any of power over a EU deal they claim that the referendum was very clear and all voters understood very clearly the issues such as the Irish Border, Customs Union, Single Market, 3rd Country Trade policies etc and as it was all so clear that Parliament does not need to say if the final deal is any good or not. If everyone knew exactly what they were voting for in June 2016, how is it that 23 months later the Cabinet can't agree what deal the UK wants with the EU? If it was so clear to the voters then, why is not known by the Cabinet today?  I think the danger to Mrs May is no longer from the Hard Brexiteers (about Conservative 60 MPs) or from the Soft Brexit Group (about 20 Conservative MPs) but from the Rump who must be starting to panic as it is becoming more likely that Mrs May is incapable to getting any EU agreement at all.  Interestingly the Conservative Party Conference takes place 30th Sep to 3rd Oct. If nothing has cleared the Brexit log jam by then, Party Members could press for Mrs May to go. As the party members are very firmly at the Hard Brexit end of the party (compared to MPs and voters) the member could insist Mrs May goes, while the Hard Brexit MPs want to Mrs May to stay to take the blame for a botched Brexit.

The media seems to have more revelations (a Guardian journalist taking part in a TV discussion on another subject hinted that there was more to come concerning migrants from other Commonwealth Countries). The media (not surprisingly) are concentrating on the \"hostile environment\" to immigrants policy of the Home Office where Mrs May was Home Secretary from 2010 to 2016.  The current Home Secretary Amber Rudd is seen as shielding Mrs May from blame. but a series of inaccurate statements to MPs which she had then had to apologize for and correct is making it her position look very shaky.  Normally a Minister that had made so many mistakes would have been sacked. Mrs May is reluctant to fire Rudd because the media would then take aim at putting the blame on Mrs May (and firing Rudd would upset the Leave/Remain balance in the Cabinet). But there must be a limit of how much blame Rudd can be given without her resigning or being sacked. If Rudd is regarded as unsackable that itself raises questions about the government.  \nI would say that there is 50% chance that Rudd will go (from the job of Home Secretary) in the next 3 weeks. If she goes two things are likely. Firstly the media will try to blame Mrs May for the Home Office mess (and there are other problems with it besides with immigration issues). An Amber Rudd who had been sacked might be keen to make it clear that the problems really date from Mrs May's role as Home Secretary. Second Amber Rudd would most likely feel very free to criticize Mrs May's policies on Brexit in general and migration in particular. It might become increasingly difficult for Mrs May to continue with her policy of putting off all decisions on Brexit. (How will the Irish border work, when will she change her policy on the/a Customs Union, how can the UK prepare for Brexit when what it will involve is no clearer than it was two years ago). \nDavid Davis is in no hurry to negotiate with the EU because he already plans to retire before any Brexit changes will be implemented. But the consequences of having no realist Brexit policies is starting to show, eventually the public will notice. Surely the pressure on Mrs May to make progress on Brexit will increase, coupled with increasing media coverage of how her six years leading the Home Office lead to the Windrush mess, could result in her getting sacked.   If Rudd goes then I think there is a 20% chance that May could go before October.

In my view this is a rather empty threat as Mrs May would (presumably) only agree to be in a Customs Union in order to resolve the problem that having border checks on the Irish border would create (it is counter to the UK/Ireland Good Friday Agreement that was ratified by referendums in both Ireland and Northern Ireland, and is the basis for ending the \"troubles\".)  Any replacement UK PM would face the same Irish Border problem. It would make no difference if they were pro or anti Brexit. An open border between two states, one inside a Customs Union and one outside appears be an oxymoron. (Claims by some Brexiteers that the Lars  Erikkson report to the EU solves the problem, shows they obviously have not read it.) Brexiteers have made two threats/predictions for what would happen if Mrs May agreed to keep the UK in a Customs Union. \n1. That Mrs May would be replaced by another Conservative PM. As any PM would still need to solve the Irish Border problem that would be of no help to the Brexiteers. Leaving the EU with no deal would not be any help either, as the Irish border would still exist and if the UK had no deal with the EU Ireland and the UK would be under a legal obligation to put up an international border and check people and goods. \n2. The Brexiteers hint that if they get rid of Mrs May as PM there could be a general election and the Labour Party would likely win. As changing the PM does not trigger a General Election (no General Election took place when Brown replaced Blair, or May replaced Cameron) a General Election would only take place if 2/3rds  of MP voted for it to take place. I know that in 2017 MP voted for an election, but it did not go well for the Conservative Brexiteers and there is no reason to think another election would go well for them. But even if it did the Irish Border problem would still exist! It would still exist if Corbyn was PM. So in my opinion the idea of the Brexiteers forcing May out is just a bluff. The Brexiteers know that there is no solution to the Irish Border problem short of a Customs Union with the EU (and remaining in the Single Market) and the last thing they really want to have a Brexiteer as PM because then they would be forced to acknowledge that they are misleading voters by claiming that they have a solution to the Irish Border - far better to blame Mrs May for not solving it (or to blame her for solving it by being in a Customs Union).  \nhttp://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2017/596828/IPOL_STU(2017)596828_EN.pdf"], [212, "2018-04-21T02:33:18Z", [0.03, 0.0, 0.0, 0.97], ""], [1034, "2018-04-20T23:19:06Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [36580, "2018-04-20T17:23:31Z", [0.3, 0.1, 0.0, 0.6], "Increasing my % that she will resign due to the recent Windrush Scandal.

Rees Mogg for example now says he will accept the ECJ as long as the UK can (in theory) choose to ignore it. This is the legal situation of all countries outside the EU, including those like Norway who are in the EEA. They follow Single Market rules, use EU institutions, take note of the EFTA Court that follows ECJ rulings, but legally these countries can choose to ignore the EFTA Court (but of course if they do, they loose their trade deals with the EU). The fact that Rees Mogg is willing to go along with this seems to indicate that the Brexiteers know they cannot get the Hard Brexit they want thru parliament. If they can't get Hard Brexit thru parliament there is little point trying to kick May out.\nBut another risk has emerged from MPs not happy about May's general non-Brexit performance. Its a cumulative problem of tough talk about action to deal with problems that results in nothing or next to nothing being done. e.g. action of plastic waste (bottles, coffee cups etc.) where action is promised that then doesn't; cheap rail travel that turns out to be rationed).

The big sticking point is the Irish border. There can be no solution to the border issue while Mrs May sticks to her red-lines of no Customs Union, no, Single Market (the ECJ can be got around by calling it the EFTA Court or something). It would seem unlikely that Tusk would want to proceed to Brexit talks Phase II until Phase 1 is complete, because with the UK red-lines in place its impossible to reach any agreement on trade that would not require a change to the NI/Ireland border. If there is no trade, deal a border will be needed, if there is bespoke deal a border will be needed, if there is Canada+++ deal a border will be needed.  I don't know how long zero Brexit progress can last, presumably at some point the UK government will have to recognise reality. I can't see Parliament just sitting waiting for trade to stop in March 2019, The only possible solution is for Mrs May to withdraw her red-lines. If she does that her whole Brexit approach will be shown to have failed. Having a PM that has so visibly failed, would in normal times, unquestionably warrant the resignation of the PM. But these are not normal time. The Conservative Party has no idea how to deal with Brexit and so may just do nothing.  (The reason way the red-lines will eventually have to go is that there is no way of not having a physical border between NI and Ireland unless both sides are in the same Customs Union and obey the same Single Market rules. The EU report Smart Border 2.0 makes it very clear that you can avoid what it calls a \"Hard Border\" outside the SM and CU but what then has to exists are the fences, customs posts, immigration checks, gates etc, which the Good Friday Agreement removed. As the EU has pointed out the Good Friday Agreement is an international treaty that was ratified overwhelmingly by referendums of the citizens in Ireland and NI, that the UK cannot change unilaterally.

It seems May wants to get the UK in the position that it could legally diverge from the UK at any future date, but it won't because the UK economy would obviously suffer.  So are the Brexiteers (and Remainers) going along with her \"vision\" because they believe it is impossible to agree it with the EU, and that in 6 months time when no deal is forthcoming the UK public will be so annoyed with the EU negotiators that a \"clean\" (hard) Brexit will be demanded by the public? Equally the Remainers could also be going along with it for now, but if the EU rejects May's vision could point out that the \"Customs Partnership\" is not much different to the CU as applied to EEA countries and the  \"arbitration system\" is not much different to the EFTA Court, and if you are mirroring Single Market rules why not just be in the Single Market for Goods (like Norway).

Research suggests that Populist supporters tend to be vote according to emoticons rather then be influenced by facts, they also appear to value attributes such as loyalty to their \"tribe\".  Liberal supporters tend to values facts and logic more highly and vote for policies.  Wales voted to Leave the EU in the Brexit referendum, but ICM finds that in the last year expectations as to the success of Brexit have declined quite sharply. ICM also makes the point  that Leave voters  both Conservative and Labour \"stick\" to their party regardless of changes to their parties position on Brexit. Thus Conservative Leave voters are planning to continue to vote Conservative even though the expectations of the benefits of Brexit are less than they were, while Labour Leave voters are planning to continue voting Labour even though Labour is slowing moving toward a softer version of Brexit (a Brexit not worth having according the Brexiteers). The contrary presumably also applies; people who did not vote for Brexit are less tribal and are more likely to switch parties to ones that match their views on Brexit. If this is indeed true it would suggest that Remainers and Soft Brexit supporters are far more likely to switch to parties that have these policies, than Leavers are likely to switch to Hard Brexit parties. So any party that advocates a Hard Brexit is likely to end up with only that party's core Hard Brexit supporters (e.g. Conservatives who support a Hard Brexit). While any party that advocates a Soft Brexit (in the Single Market/Customs Union ) or No Brexit is likely to keep its traditional tribal supporters (e.g. Labour Leave voters) but attract additions supporters who prefer its policy. (e.g people who have voted Conservative but don't like Brexit).         If this is true the rational thing for all parties to do to get the most votes would be to have a policy of Soft Brexit. (I am allowing for the facts that Leave won the 2016 referendum, and that few voters for Leave have admitted they have changed their mind. The passage of time and demographics is likely to have given anti_Brexit supporters a lead before the next General Election, plus the referendum brought out Leave voters who do not normally vote).  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-43230062"], [1034, "2018-03-01T16:12:33Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [172, "2018-03-01T01:45:40Z", [0.05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.95], ""], [691, "2018-02-28T15:26:05Z", [0.03, 0.0, 0.0, 0.97], ""], [1333, "2018-02-28T14:23:32Z", [0.35, 0.0, 0.0, 0.65], ""], [30059, "2018-02-28T13:49:52Z", [0.15, 0.15, 0.0, 0.7], ""], [55447, "2018-02-28T11:27:07Z", [0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.75], ""], [55342, "2018-02-28T09:42:47Z", [0.2, 0.0, 0.0, 0.8], ""], [1034, "2018-02-28T06:43:40Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [24785, "2018-02-28T01:49:14Z", [0.1, 0.3, 0.0, 0.6], ""], [52795, "2018-02-28T01:27:32Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "Due to Brexit negotiation continuity."], [35618, "2018-02-27T19:14:25Z", [0.15, 0.1, 0.0, 0.75], ""], [55042, "2018-02-27T17:07:40Z", [0.45, 0.25, 0.0, 0.3], ""], [1056, "2018-02-27T16:43:55Z", [0.25, 0.05, 0.0, 0.7], ""], [46762, "2018-02-27T16:42:21Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "Leaders relish challenges as its an opportunity to make a change. \nPoliticians flee challenges.

It is likely that tomorrow the EU will present its draft text of the legal document that follows on from the phase 1 Brexit negotiations that were agreed on 8th Dec. The Brexiteers seem to have a very different understanding of what was agreed on the 8th Dec to the EU. If the UK follows previous form it will accept the EU's version of what was agreed. If it does then the hard-Brexit MPs might call for an election for a new leader to replace Mrs May.  If the UK will not accept the EU's version of what was agreed on 8th Dec the Brexit process will probably be halted by the EU until a new agreement on phase 1 can be made. As there appears to be no way to produce a phase 1 agreement that matches the aspirations of the Brexiteers to both have no border checks with Ireland, while the whole UK is free to diverge from EU rules and make trade deals with 3rd countries. It remains as difficult to understand now, as it has done for the last year, how a total UK rejection of the Customs Union and Single Market could provide an answer to the Irish border question.  It is generally assumed that the argument over what was agreed about an implementation period will be resolved (in favour of the EU interpretation).  But if any of phase 1 is not sorted out the EU will be unwilling to proceed.  By the end of the week Mrs May is supposed to have clarified what the UK wants as a future relationship with the EU. So far several Ministers have made speeches that have been strong on what the UK does not want coupled with a few things it does want that are incompatible with what it does not want. There has been no attempt to describe any type of framework into which the wants and don't wants could be fitted. My guess is that the EU will dismiss Mrs Mays description of a future relationship as a wish list and tell her to provide a description of a coherent structure of what the UK is looking for or the EU will simply proceed on the basis that the UK wants a Canada Minus trade deal and will be leaving all EU institutions.    So in the next month Mrs May will disappoint either the hard Brexit Conservatives or the soft Brexit and Remainers. Which ever group she disappoints will have to either admit that they will not get the Brexit outcome they want (In the case of the hard Brexiteers) or try and change the PM.  Assuming Mrs May survives the next few weeks she still has the problem that even if the EU agree to start phase 2 talks there is no guarantee  that an agreement will emerge and MPs could reject any deal that did emerge.

Having agreed a deal on Phase 1 of Leaving the EU it has become clear that Mrs May is not able to get the Brexiteers to accept it. The Implementation  period asked for (by the UK) was agreed in principle as a period in which the UK would be outside the political institutions of the EU but that would otherwise maintain the status quo. Since then the Brexiteers have been insisting that during the implementation period the status quo would not apply to the way that new EU migrants would be dealt with, that the UK would expect to make (not just negotiate) trade deals with 3rd countries, not be subject to all EU rules and laws, and even that the UK might want to not have an implementation period. \nSince last week's Brexit Committee meeting the UK government has been unable to agree to provide any clarification as to what it wants. As it seems the Brexit Committee was deadlocked, but Mrs May felt unable to either present her view of the way forward (it is reported she did not offer any views at all) or to use to her position to break the deadlock it must be concluded that she is so weak that whatever view she expressed or supported would not have been supported by the Parliamentary Conservative Party (PCP). \nAt some point the UK government must take decisions on Brexit. Mrs May seems to be hoping that some external event will miraculously unite the PCP to one view which she can then follow. So the question is will such an external event change things before the PCP gets tired of waiting of waiting for a miracle to happen? Or even if the miracle does happen will the PCP decide that Mrs May is no the person to implement whatever type of Brexit the miracle suggests can/needs to be delivered. Possible \"events\" are a Conservative rebellion by Soft or Hard Brexit MPs or by Conservative Peers, or the EU shuts down negotiations until the UK gets it act together, a very clear vote in the local elections due in May, or unions and employers demand action, Conservative donors publicly announce no more funding. \nThe excuse that the PCP cannot agree on who would be better than Mrs May, is becoming rather thin as it looks like anyone would probably be better than nothing, and in reality having Mrs May as PM is not much different from having no one as PM.\nMrs May seems to be running out of road down which to kick the can.

Still, both the center and the soft-Brexiteers would likely support May, so she has a better than 50/50 chance to win such a contest if she chooses to run.   For outcome (3), I put 20%. This will materialize if May decides not to run, or if some significant cataclysm makes her very unpopular. There is plenty of time for this to happen by Oct 1.

In any case, holding an election halfway through Brexit negotiation is something that probably all parties would want to avoid. The likelihood of a General Election this year is therefore c.0%\n(Base rate is 28% [20GEs in 72 years]; Of those only 4 happened in the middle of an election cycle [1951; 1966; 1974 and 2017] taking us down to 6%; And those 4 were always because the Government saw the opportunity to improve its position - something which the current Government does not see - taking us down to more or less 0%. An internal party challenge requires the support of 48 Conservative MPs under party rules. This is not impossible given that some MPs are currently unhappy with various aspects of Government policy: http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-plot-tory-mps-grant-shapps-brexiteers-remainers-conservative-cabinet-leader-latest-a7985861.html\nNevertheless, an ousting in the midst of important international negotiations seems to rely on the negotiations themselves being rejected by Conservative MPs. For reasons of rebelliousness of Parliament over Brexit-related legislation, I think this is a higher prospect than in a normal year. I will give it a c.70% chance. The final category of scandal, ill health etc. forcing a change is much more difficult to predict. The one clear case of ill health forcing a Prime Minister out (Churchill) happened to a legendary smoker and drinker at the age of 81. Theresa May is not in a comparable position. A \"black swan\" scandal on the level of Suez Crisis, Profumo Affair is inherently unlikely and more or less impossible to forecast. What does seem entirely plausible is a failure of Brexit negotiations forcing her to stand down. It does look though that currently negotiations are progressing (Phase 1 has been passed; the EU is looking likely to concede on the UK's main demand for financial services access). Nevertheless, a high risk remains, which I will put at 70% (20% higher than an average year) Conclusion:\nBase rate of 21%; \nExtremely low likelihood of a GE this year (-11%) =11%*0\nHigh chance of an internal party challenge (-1%) =3%*0.7\nReasonable chance of a voluntary resignation (-2%) =7%*0.7\nTherefore 93% chance of no change in 2018; 94% chance given discounting of November and December.

Presumably the objective was to show that the Conservative Party is the environmental party and by being the environmental party to appeal to green voters who Mrs May assumes are the younger voters, which the Conservatives lack. But the \"policy\" failed to impress. Older voters have pointed out (see BBC link) that in 2005 the Conservatives claimed to have seen the (green) light, but when they had the power to do something about it they seem to had second thoughts. Others have pointed out most of the environmental improvements carried out in the last 30 years have been due to EU legislation e.g. forcing the UK to stop pumping raw sewage into the sea and rivers, clean up beaches, ban chemicals, improve air quality, reduce the numbers of single use plastic bags, install wind farms and solar panels. As Mrs May is not known to have had any interest in the environment, apart from re-introducing fox hunting, the green leaning younger voters are not likely to be impressed. The comment \"Talk is Cheap\" seems to apply to much of Mrs May's supposed aspirations, that do not seem to actually match any actions. The cynics (and realists) regard a 25 year plan to reduce plastic packaging as just talk.  If Mrs May really thinks a unique comprehensive trade deal that squares her contradictory \"red lines\" can be negotiated with the EU in 8 months, why does she think 25 years is needed to stop \"unnecessary plastic waste\"?    So Mrs May becoming a green champion for hoards of keen young Conservatives supports seems to be a mirage.    Therefore the Conservatives will continue to be keen to avoid an election, so will afraid of replacing Mrs May. (If May is unpopular, so will the Conservative Party. So the worse May does, the worse the Conservatives will do in the polls. The worse the Conservatives do in the polls the less likely they are to risk changing their leader and risking an election.) http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-42654268"], [48335, "2018-01-12T07:51:09Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.85], ""], [47597, "2018-01-12T04:30:08Z", [0.2, 0.05, 0.0, 0.75], "Conservatives will let Maybtake blame for EU treaty trouble."], [47799, "2018-01-12T03:06:02Z", [0.3, 0.05, 0.0, 0.65], ""], [48100, "2018-01-12T03:05:45Z", [0.18, 0.02, 0.0, 0.8], "Status quo benefits most, May could move/be moved if needed to reset negotiations"], [48309, "2018-01-11T21:44:26Z", [0.3, 0.1, 0.5, 0.1], ""], [48412, "2018-01-11T20:48:45Z", [0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25], ""], [691, "2018-01-11T20:12:30Z", [0.05, 0.09, 0.0, 0.86], ""], [47005, "2018-01-11T19:41:02Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [48224, "2018-01-11T18:31:38Z", [0.15, 0.55, 0.15, 0.15], ""], [47256, "2018-01-11T10:44:07Z", [0.55, 0.35, 0.05, 0.05], ""], [15196, "2018-01-11T05:54:57Z", [0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.9], ""], [13377, "2018-01-11T05:07:37Z", [0.15, 0.0, 0.0, 0.85], ""], [37488, "2018-01-11T03:45:03Z", [0.15, 0.0, 0.0, 0.85], ""], [21884, "2018-01-11T03:43:56Z", [0.1, 0.02, 0.0, 0.88], ""], [42188, "2018-01-10T21:38:35Z", [0.1, 0.1, 0.0, 0.8], ""], [44518, "2018-01-10T19:24:10Z", [0.45, 0.45, 0.05, 0.05], "Mays job is at risk if she doesn't get a deal made with her at least on  of the opposition parties and if Brexit goes south and the economy in the UK continues to get worse she will lose"], [48029, "2018-01-10T16:44:42Z", [0.35, 0.1, 0.05, 0.5], ""], [48156, "2018-01-10T13:21:56Z", [0.05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.95], "Because no sane person wants that job during the Brexit.

May yesterday. All the media regardless of political views are agreeing that her cabinet reshuffle was badly done, from announcements made that were then withdrawn to ministers refusing to accept jobs. It had also been widely reported that elements that the media thought were good seem to be in spite of Mrs May, not because of her planning them. Pro and anti Brexit media is concerned that if she cannot organise the membership of her cabinet then negotiating a complex deal with the EU (and all member states) is a worry. \nThe question is how bad May's performance has to get before the 1922 Committee decides that she has to go, in spite of their not being any other Conservative MP who looks likely to be able to rescue the government. The 1922 Committee  will obviously be aware that another general election would probably make things worse for the Conservatives so they will want to avoid that at all costs.  \nSo if Mrs May goes it will not be due to another general election this year, but because the Conservative Party replaces her as leader.  If that were to happen a new PM would have to complete the Brexit negotiations, which would require compromises to be made (May's \"red lines\" will not survive in negotiations) and so whatever Brexit was agreed (or not agreed) would not match any version that the electorate had voted on, which would surely increase demands for another General Election. Another General Election would be likely to reject who ever the May replacement was. The 1922 Committee will know this; the EU will know this, and both will act accordingly e.g. the EU will not offer a version of Brexit can the UK PM can present to the UK voters as a triumph because they will see a bad Brexit offer as forcing the UK to hold an election (to accept or Reject it). The 1922 Committee will see changing the PM has the first move in a process which is likely to lead to kicking the Conservatives out of power. \nSo my conclusion is; bad as she is her many detractors in the Conservative Party will have to keep her as PM because if she goes its likely that the Conservative Party looses power.  As MPs will also be seeing a very weak PM, the many Conservative MPs who oppose a hard Brexit and/or dislike Mrs May (more of them after the reshuffle) will see their future better served by opposing anything they think is wrong that May proposes (who wants to go down with the ship), so getting a majority in Parliament will be harder, which in turn makes May's position weaker.

Will May be replaced by either the leader of another party in a general election or will she be succeeded by someone from her own ranks? General Election.\nThere may be grounds for May to call an election in 2019 when the Brexit negotiations are complete, but it is hard to see why she would willingly call one this year, especially after the debacle of 2017. Let\u2019s call that 1%. The Conservatives may lose the support of the DUP and be forced to go to the country, but how likely is it that the DUP will abandon ship? They are in a tremendously powerful position to influence policy, particularly with respect to Brexit, and they are being handsomely rewarded for their support. On the other hand there is considerable tension between the hard Brexiteers and the DUP over the Irish border. Probably the most likely cause of a rupture leading to an election. Call it 7%. Therefore with an 8% chance of a general election and say a 40% chance of a conservative victory if one occurs then we have .6 *.08 = 0.048 = 5% chance of a leader from another party. Let\u2019s say 4% Labour and 1% some other party. Internal Succession\nWhat about a leadership challenge from within the Conservative Party? May is repeatedly described as weak but who would challenge her in the next nine months? Johnson and Gove seem the most likely to be in a position to force an election but how would they be viewed for destabilising an already weak government? Perhaps they would simply pave the way for another candidate. Furthermore they have the best of both worlds at the moment. The policy they want is being enacted (if not entirely as they would like) and yet they are not responsible for any of the inevitable shortcomings of whatever deal is reached. May is further making it hard for Gove and Johnson to act by keeping them close to her in the cabinet. All in all it looks like a stalemate to me, but whilst May is a steady politician both Gove and Johnson are decidedly more volatile. We can\u2019t dismiss the possibility of trouble. I\u2019ll plump for an 8% chance that May is usurped from within.  As a base case let\u2019s take the average tenure of British Prime Ministers. This comes in at 5.47 years (fromWikipedia data) so May has a long way to go on this measure. By 1st October 2018 she will have been Prime Minister for 2.21 years. Only two Prime Ministers, 3.7%, have failed to make it to 2.21 years having already served 1.48 years.  My total probability of May being replaced is currently 13%, which in light of the base case seems wildly over the top. It\u2019s a small sample but nonetheless I feel I have to scale back my initial predictions. I\u2019ll increase the 3.7% to 5% as these are volatile times, and adjust the other predictions on a pro rata basis.

The Fixed Term Parliament Act makes snap elections relatively difficult to call. In 2017, Theresa May sought the approval of Parliament to hold a snap election. The reason for this was that she was confident that her party could significantly increase its majority.  Now, however, the Conservative party is weak, with a lost majority and poor poll performance. If the last snap election was called because Theresa May was confident, the situation now is the inverse, meaning she will be highly disinclined to call a snap election herself. Additionally, to call 2 snap elections in such quick succession would be perceived as especially weak.  Thus, I believe a Labour PM is the most unlikely outcome. I have not set it at 0 on the chance that  she feels forced to call a snap election due to combined pressure from the public, the opposition, and her own cabinet. This still seems extremely unlikely as this would require the support of Conservative MPs, who have other means of removing May.  It would be much easier for Conservative MPs to remove May via internal party mechanisms, as an election runs the risk of losing more ground to Labour, the worst case scenario for the Conservative Party. How likely is it that May will be replaced by another Conservative MP? Relatively, but potentially not before Oct 2018. After poor performance in the 2005 general election, Blair was replaced by Brown in 2007. This, coupled with the fact that a leadership contest would further destabilise Brexit negotiations, makes the idea of a leadership battle BEFORE the date stated somewhat unlikely. Yet, arguably May's Government are more unstable than Blair's in 2005. May does not have a majority in Parliament, and is relying on the support of the DUP, a relationship that might become more complicated as Brexit negotiations continue (Irish border issue).  There are also various sections of Conservative MPs cross with May's decision to call the 2017 snap election. There are a few big personalities that one could see replacing May (Rees-Mogg, Johnson, et al). The last leadership election was muddled, with candidates standing down until May was the last person standing - all before the end of the first stage of Conservative leadership process.

She could become ill or sick of the job (5% chance?). She could loose the support of the DUP and no longer command a majority in Parliament or she could be overthrown by hard line Brixiteers or hard line Remainers in the Conservative parliamentary party (15% to 25% chance). But a walkout by the DUP would not result in any conceivable majority government that would  be more likely to support DUP views, so it is difficult to see any advantage to them in walking out. Replacing Mrs May with any Conservative that actually had any strong views of Brexit would cause more obvious fractures in the Conservative parliamentary party - a strong hard Brexit PM would not be supported by enough MPs to push a hard Brexit through parliament, a strong soft Brexit or no Brexit PM would not be supported by all Conservative MPs, but with support from most of the other parties in parliament they could command a majority for a soft Brexit or no Brexit. If DUP or Conservative rebels (of the hard or soft variety) meant May did not have a majority it would be bound to lead to calls for a general election, and the last general election did not go well for the Conservative Party or for the Hard Brexit cause so Conservatives will want to avoid another one. So my view is that faced with a big decision in order to get enough votes in Parliament Mrs May will have to listen to the soft Brexit Conservatives more than the Hard Conservatives, and that no anti-May group would really gain by throwing May out.

[Can anyone else think of any alternatives??] Theresa May is a 61yo female in a first world nation.  Her baseline risk of death in the next 9.5 months is about 0.003 (0.3%).  The increased risk imparted by her diabetes and stressful job is probably balanced out by her vigorous physical hobbies and lack of children (motherhood is hell).  If she dies, the certain outcome will be \"Yes, someone from the Conservative Party.\" Resignation of her own free will is unlikely, not in the next 10 months anyway.  It is conceivable that a long-serving PM might stand down to allow an orderly succession, especially to a colleague at the same level as part of a power-sharing arrangement (Blair-Brown in the UK; Hawke-Keating in Australia).  I can't see May is in that situation.  If she does freely resign, the certain outcome will be \"Yes, someone from the Conservative Party.\" If there is a Tory leadership challenge, then either she wins (\"No\") or she loses (\"Yes, someone from the Conservative Party\"). The Conservative-DUP agreement is necessary for May to maintain confidence.  Labour's position in the polling is significantly stronger than it was at the time of the June election, and Labour would benefit massively from (yet another) return to the polls.  Another election would very likely lead to \"Yes, someone from the Labor Party\".  The DUP know this, and while it is possible (but unlikely) that they would withdraw confidence in order to play hardball with the Government, even then I think they would rather form a more favourable agreement to restore confidence with the Tories within the following 14 days than go back to the polls. The Conservative-DUP agreement, assuming it remains intact, needs to lose 7 seats in order to lose a working majority for confidence and supply.  In the UK, by-elections come at the rate of about 3-5 per year.  For the Government to lose their majority, there would have to be 7 by-elections, in seats that are currently Tory-DUP held, that are then lost by the incumbent member.  Using some rough estimates, the chance of this happening AT ALL in the next 10 months is about 10%; the chance of it happening _7_ times is effectively zero. So let's put some numbers on this ...\n(a)(b)  p(May resigns freely or dies) = 0.01; thus YES, CONSERVATIVE.\n(c)  p(leadership challenge) = 0.30; if so, 50% of NO, 50% of YES, CONSERVATIVE.\n(d)(e)  p(Tories lose working majority within 10mth) = 0.03; if so, almost certainly YES, LABOUR.\n... and if none of the above, May remains PM through to October. Main things I need to keep my eye on ...\n*  How likely is a Conservative leadership challenge?\n*  If a leadership challenge, are how likely is May to win?  How likely are any other contenders?\n*  If an election is held, how likely is Labour to be able to form government after?\n*  Are there an abnormal number of by-elections being held, that is, enough to threaten the Government majority?"], [42045, "2017-12-07T22:14:19Z", [0.23, 0.05, 0.0, 0.72], ""], [21884, "2017-12-07T13:56:29Z", [0.18, 0.07, 0.0, 0.75], ""], [1333, "2017-12-07T13:18:25Z", [0.35, 0.15, 0.0, 0.5], ""], [41835, "2017-12-07T13:15:11Z", [0.45, 0.55, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [42198, "2017-12-07T11:28:28Z", [0.44, 0.1, 0.01, 0.45], ""], [42197, "2017-12-07T09:57:03Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.03, 0.87], ""], [39937, "2017-12-07T08:57:48Z", [0.6, 0.28, 0.0, 0.12], ""], [41688, "2017-12-07T03:24:43Z", [0.15, 0.1, 0.0, 0.75], "Outside view: Change unlikely Inside view: Brexit puts large amount of uncertainty into question.

Although Theresa May is in a generally weak position following the loss of her majority in the last election, inertia is the most likely outcome, even looking 10 months out.  In forming this prediction, I made the following observations:\n- The DUP are likely to do just about anything to prevent a Labour government, and even if they did pull the plug on the confidence and supply arrangement it's not a sure thing that Labour would get in (it has been decades since the last left-wing Labour government, many in England will never vote for Corbyn, SNP took over a lot of the old Labour vote in Scotland). Despite this, I don't rule out another crisis within the Tory party, new elections, and Labour gaining enough seats to form the next government. I think however that it would likely be some kind of coalition/supply (Lib Dem, SNP likely partners as they would be keen to put the brakes on Brexit) rather than an outright majority. I put the probability of any of these events leading to a Labour PM at around 20%.\n- Infighting in the Tory party appears to have dampened down a little bit, but it's still there in the background. Grant Shapps' campaign to oust Theresa May didn't really go anywhere and it appears he actually got quite a bit of backlash from it. I put the probability of some major event happening that causes Theresa May to be replaced by a colleague in the Tory party at around 30% (the DUP's votes are still agiven).\n- I would assign a probability <1% to someone from a party other than Labour/Tories, although if decimal places were allowed this would not be zero (if something it possible, it is to some small degree probable)\n- Considering this all in the bigger picture, I am then left with a probabilty of about 50% (just under if we are being exact, see previous point) that Theresa May remains PM up to and on 1 October 2018. www.fxtradesurfer.com"], [42073, "2017-12-01T22:18:55Z", [0.4, 0.6, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [40720, "2017-12-01T22:15:17Z", [0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.75], ""], [25973, "2017-12-01T22:02:29Z", [0.12, 0.8, 0.0, 0.08], ""], [42069, "2017-12-01T19:44:04Z", [0.9, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1], ""], [42058, "2017-12-01T12:11:38Z", [0.2, 0.44, 0.34, 0.02], ""], [42054, "2017-12-01T09:57:18Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [37488, "2017-12-01T04:49:59Z", [0.35, 0.0, 0.0, 0.65], "this is the 2nd time Morgan Stanley has said so this month, I think, and though it's probably wise to hedge their bets by assuming a higher probability for investment caution, I think no one wants the chaos and unless it looks like there's a path toward a better solution and at the moment I see more gripes than alternatives.
