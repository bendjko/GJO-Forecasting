First, you have a pretty bipartisan agreement that there should being something done about bump stocks. \ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeffAt the same however, in terms of how to go about banning bump stocks has been less compromising. The Democratic party has introduced a bill back in October that would completely and efficiently ban bump stocks and the language involved in the bill is pretty straightforward and carefully crafted where the law wouldn't apply to other weaponry thus \"taming\" adherent 2nd Amendment supports. The Republican Party, with the statement from Speaker Ryan, propose that such banning action take place under the jurisdiction of Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). As mentioned in the link to the Washington Post article, this move could do the Republican platform and firearm ideology more harm than good. Very recently in March, Trump signed an executive order that instructed the Attorney General to regulate the devices. In conclusion, my answer to this question is at a 12% yes because I consider the question to include Congressional legislature governance. I think there is a good chance for such a bill to pass because of the recent momentum the debate of gun control has erupted in. \n http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/03/23/what-are-bump-stocks-how-work-and-why-trump-wants-them-banned.html\nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/03/10/doj-moves-outlaw-bump-stocks-making-them-illegal-own-sell/413237002/ https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-gops-bump-stock-cop-out/2017/10/18/a190d7ce-b358-11e7-9e58-e6288544af98_story.html?utm_term=.f61137040d0d"], [691, "2018-04-03T13:04:01Z", [0.0], ""], [1333, "2018-04-02T22:10:15Z", [0.65], ""], [57428, "2018-04-02T12:48:14Z", [0.0], ""], [34353, "2018-04-02T11:06:12Z", [0.0], ""], [30610, "2018-04-02T08:00:22Z", [0.35], "cutting it close with the 90 day comment period. but much closer to a toss-up now than before"], [39937, "2018-04-02T06:19:59Z", [0.0], ""], [57483, "2018-04-02T03:50:38Z", [0.85], ""], [57483, "2018-04-02T03:33:00Z", [0.65], ""], [920, "2018-04-01T22:55:12Z", [1.0], ""], [368, "2018-04-01T22:18:46Z", [0.0], ""], [23006, "2018-04-01T20:01:44Z", [0.13], "Revising down on assumption that while atf can propose the final rule, it will be challenged through courts and won\u2019t hold up within timeframe."], [57427, "2018-04-01T16:59:53Z", [0.15], ""], [691, "2018-04-01T16:57:39Z", [0.0], ""], [23879, "2018-04-01T16:51:02Z", [0.02], "Free riding on the work of various commenters [1] helpfully summarized by @Anneinak [2].

From this, it sounds like all it takes is DoJ regulatory action.

Unless there is pressure to immediately post the new rule after the 90-day submission (Mar 23- June 21), I would imagine the review of public comments would take more than a couple of days (or at least it did for the FCC vote last year and it was clear from the outset that both Trump and Pai were pushing as hard as they could, though the FCC is an independent regulatory agency and I'm not sure if the ATF is).  They seem to have a somewhat different rule-making procedure, but their process is probably more pro forma at this point than desperate to change a policy as quickly as possible or to make a big public announcement for significant political points.  Sessions chose a 90-day comment period instead of 60, though the reg-map suggests that \"Executive Order 12866 established 60 days as the standard for the comment period.\"  On the other hand, they pushed the review through OMB in less than 30 days, which seems a little impressive to me since I think the law gives OMB/OIRA 90 days to review rules. After the 90-day comment period, no matter how long it takes to create a final rule (and I'm guessing they won't change the arguments internally much since 1) they already countered their own argument that bump stocks didn't meet the \"multiple trigger pull\" definition they made 3 months ago and 2) since they've estimated this will costs millions and put 1 of 2 companies making bump stocks out of business and have significant economic impact and yet are still arguing that 3) the rule is required to take care of the \"negative externality\" that bump stocks are being used for crime regardless of their reason for purchase and that the economic mechanisms can't manage the criminal results that nevertheless ensue (p26 https://www.justice.gov/file/1046006/download).  If they've already countered the 5 or 6 most likely bitter and deep (and reasonable) complaints about making bump stocks illegal (and they seem fairly comprehensive to me), then there's not much they seem likely to substantially change.   Still, once a final rule is made, it has to be published in the Register and for any kind of significant rule (which affect small businesses or has a \"significant economic impact\" - not sure how OMB ruled on how significant millions of dollars is for a few thousand businesses, 400,000 owners and 550,000 pieces of equipment down the drain) for public notice for an additional 30 or even 60 days before before it goes into effect.  If the law counts as the \"ban\" to meet the question requirements, then July 1 might just barely be enough time.  But it seems likely to take more than 7 business days even to get to the public register publication of a final rule.  Maybe I just overestimate the pace at which government offices and oversight work.\nhttps://www.federalregister.gov/uploads/2011/01/the_rulemaking_process.pdf\nhttps://www.foreffectivegov.org/sites/default/files/regs/rcenter/backgroundpdfs/I.-V..pdf"], [12983, "2018-03-25T22:31:07Z", [0.85], ""], [54723, "2018-03-25T18:08:45Z", [0.25], ""], [368, "2018-03-25T17:51:50Z", [0.0], ""], [54719, "2018-03-25T17:27:25Z", [0.65], "With all shootings this year, and pressure from Parkland movement, there will enough pressure to do \"something\" & bump stocks are the easiest target in a very complicated debate.

As I recall (always a tenuous starting point, especially since I haven't had to mux about in this stuff for several decades), they have to publish the full proposed rule in the Federal Register, and that's what starts the 90-day comment period.  After that, they have to publish the final rule in the Register, but they don't have to do that right away--and if they want to make significant changes, they file an amended proposed rule and start over again, I think.  (There is an earlier step, the notice of a proposed rule, which happened in December but as I recall doesn't affect any deadlines other than the comment deadline on the Notice.) Far as I can tell, the proposed rule hasn't hit the Register yet, so the 90-day countdown can't start until Monday at the earliest; that's the 26th.   They could just barely hit the 1 July deadline if they publish on the 26th: The 91st day is I think Sunday, 24 June, but the Register doesn't come out on weekends, so the very earliest possible date to effectively promulgate the reg would be Monday, 25 June--and that's if they do all the bits as soon as possible and don't decide to file an amended proposed reg.  It is not hard to imagine that feet will be dragged. So I'm coming up a bit but not much.  I still harbor a suspicion that they will figure out a way to render this proposal meaningless, or amend it to death, or quietly withdraw it, or in some other wise cause it to disappear. One supposes the NRA will file a suit immediately, but I'm pretty sure no court would grant an injunction to suspend or prevent the rulemaking process--since the rule won't have been promulgated yet, there can't be any harm for an injunction to prevent.  And I suppose this Q would still be a Yes even if they get an injunction the next morning.   I am fully prepared, and indeed would be delighted, to be corrected about any or all of this.

So the regulatory process is now at step 6 out of 7. Considering that there is a 90-day comment period: March 23, 2018 + 90 days = June 21, 2018. So after the comment period, the DOJ through the ATF has 10 days to \"make final\" the NPRM.

This means it has to go to public comment (this is separate from the proposed regulation in December).  The current was placed on the federal register 6 days ago, but oddly, has been removed, stating, \"The Office of the Federal Register withdrew this document after it went on public inspection due to technical errors.\"  This is the place where it is available for public inspection and comment.  So this has not happened yet, obviously.   There have been no meetings completed around this regulation (as per the OMB website) yet.  So it is obviously in the very first step of the process, if you even want to call it that.  I believe the timeline for public comment is 30 days, once it actually becomes available.

Its a very complex problem. Taking action to reduce mass shooting is not complex (reducing the availability of guns, especially to high risk categories of people, works in other countries so there is no reason to believe it would not reduce mass shootings in the US). The complex problem is working out why so many Americans choose to believe that it is better to have lax gun controls at a cost of frequent mass shootings, rather than more effective gun control and less shootings. \nBut then why do Trump and his supporters choose to believe that trade wars are a good thing and easily won, when the evidence suggests otherwise?\nAnd (to correct any anti-American bias) why do Brexiteers in the UK believe the UK will gain from leaving the EU when all the evidence suggest the opposite?  Why do they continue to believe the EU is only motivated by economic rationality (so the EU will give the UK a good trade deal because a bad trade deal would cost the UK economy a lot, and the EU economy a little) when the Brexiteers are not themselves motivated by economic rationality (if they were they would not be want to leave the EU, Single Market and Customs Union).\nClearly the age of rationality has not yet arrived. \nMaybe the legal system and commerce will eventually solve the problem.

According to the U.S Department of Education, there are about 100,000 public schools in the country, including all elementary, middle, high and vocational schools. There are also about 33,000 private schools. At the rate of $5,000 per unit, it would cost about $500 million to equip all of the public schools with a metal detector.   If we take $72,000 per year in extra security guard pay as the base (and it's likely to be lower as not all schools are as large as a 2,000-person high school), we are looking at $7.2 billion per year in guard pay. Another factor that could help increase security is having a police officer specifically assigned to each school in the United States. With the average police officer salary being around $61,000 per year, according to the U.S. Department of Labor, we would need another $6.1 billion to accomplish that goal. So for about half a billion dollars in initial investment, and a total of about $13.3 billion in additional expenses every year, we can get our kids much better protected than they currently are.

Will something actually come of all the talk?  Or will it all fade away without any action having been taken, as it always has before?   It seems to me--and I could be wrong--that in the past the issue of gun control and safety was basically promoted by the survivors and families of victims, and sympathizers . . . ex.  \"The Brady Campaign\".  What seems different to me is that this time the issue is being promoted by broader segments of the public.  It's not just friends & family of the 17 most recent victims who are demanding action, but it seems like it is a whole generation of young people across the nation.     Also, maybe churches are starting to call attention to the issue of gun violence.  Today, I read that one of the most prominent American Catholic Cardinals, Cardinal Cupich of Chicago (a hunter who has organized pheasant hunts for his brother Catholic bishops), is calling for  QUOTE:  \" . . . . \u201ccommon-sense\u201d laws that limit gun ownership to \u201cthose who have proven they can manage the responsibilities that come with it, just as we do with automobiles.\u201d  It\u2019s about upholding the rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness that our young people are reminding us about.\u201d  He also pointed to the role of arms dealers who are driven by profits in \u201cour national epidemic of gun violence,\u201d noting that some oppose limits even on armor-piercing bullets, bump stocks and high-volume magazines.  \u201cMy brother bishops in the United States have long advocated for sensible gun-safety regulations without any infringement on the legitimate rights guaranteed by the Second Amendment,\u201d Cupich said. \u201cDefense of those rights, however, cannot take a second place to the rights our children are demanding to guarantee their futures.\u201d \"Cupich also referenced critics of the Parkland student activists, many of whom have reported receiving death threats from gun advocates. In addition to action on gun control, Americans should \u201cat the least \u2026 defend their right and the rights of others to speak out, and condemn any attempt to silence them with defamation and threats of retribution.\u201d\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  So, I see that this time it is different.  People are connecting the dots, reciting the gruesome and shameful litany of mass murders.  No longer are people referring to these as isolated incidents.  No longer is the issue being brought to the public's attention just by survivors and families of victims.   Now the questions become more specific:  will FEDERAL action be taken prior to July 1st? and will it involve a BAN of bump stocks?  I don't think the initial action will be federal (I think it will be at the state level), I don't see it happening by 7/1, I don't think it will involve bump stocks, and if it does involve bump stocks, it won't be a ban.   So, while I think there's a higher probability of action on this issue, I don't see this question resolving as \"Yes\". https://www.ncronline.org/news/politics/cardinal-cupich-calls-action-gun-legislation"], [16778, "2018-02-28T17:56:05Z", [0.6], "The political calculus has changed significantly after Parkland, FL.

Trump's surprise orders this week comes as officials from the department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are well into a review of whether they can regulate the devices without action from Congress. The path to a ban is neither simple nor quick. An ATF ban on the accessories, which allow semi-automatic rifles to mimic machine guns, would likely thrust the department into a prolonged legal battle with gun manufacturers while the devices remain on the market. But any congressional effort to create new gun control laws would need support from the pro-gun Republican majority. And Republicans have moved in the other direction, attempting to loosen gun laws, even after 59 people were killed in Las Vegas. Despite the president stepping up pressure on the department in the aftermath of the Florida high school shooting, some ATF officials maintain that only Congress can render such devices illegal, and, in any event, amending existing gun laws or passing new legislation would be a faster approach. Acting ATF director Thomas Brandon has sent mixed signals on what the agency can do. He told lawmakers in December that the ATF and Justice Department would not have initiated the review if a ban \"wasn't a possibility at the end,\" but he has also expressed doubt that it would be able to do so without congressional intervention (para. 1-5).

Although the Obama Administration repeatedly concluded that particular bump stock type devices were lawful to purchase and possess, I sought further clarification of the law restricting fully automatic machineguns. Accordingly, following established legal protocols, the Department of Justice started the process of promulgating a Federal regulation interpreting the definition of \u201cmachinegun\u201d under Federal law to clarify whether certain bump stock type devices should be illegal. The Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking was published in the Federal Register on December 26, 2017. Public comment concluded on January 25, 2018, with the Department of Justice receiving over 100,000 comments. Today, I am directing the Department of Justice to dedicate all available resources to complete the review of the comments received, and, as expeditiously as possible, to propose for notice and comment a rule banning all devices that turn legal weapons into machineguns. Although I desire swift and decisive action, I remain committed to the rule of law and to the procedures the law prescribes.

Speaking at the White House days after a mass shooting at a Florida high school that killed 14 students and three teachers, Mr. Trump said that he had directed Attorney General Jeff Sessions to develop the regulations, saying that the step would help prevent future mass shootings (para. 1-2).
