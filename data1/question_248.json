NC's population is 8.8% Hispanic, and I will assign maybe 70% of them will vote for Clinton of all the number of people that will vote in this election (disregarding the difference in number of voters based on socioeconomic and race), which is roughly 6.16% of the population. That being said, of the remaining 91%, roughly 20% are categorized as black. With Trump raising racial tensions I assume that 60% of the black population will vote for Clinton. So far the scoreboard is: Clinton: 18% vs Trump: 11%. The white category takes up around 67%, with the remaining being other. At this point I would like to examine this by age. The older people tend to go with Trump, especially since Trump owns a good portion of real estate in NC (golf courses, residential, etc). Plus age correlates with conservatives. VERY roughly I classified \"old\" as over 50. This broke down into 41% of people of voting age were classified as young and 59% as old. This of course skewed because a lot of people are transplants and come to NC to retire, and this isn't a typical election. Here I made a educated guess that the young were skewed 55/45 in favor of Democrat and the old were skewed 60/40 in favor of Republicans. I based this on the fact that historically NC is a red state. This updates the scoreboard to: Clinton: 48.91 Trump: 47.06. The remaining 4% are from other races and will probably skew towards Clinton's favor.

Currently, 30% of the population - not necessarily voters - is hispanic, black, or other non-white.  The state went to Obama in 2008, then to Romney in 2012.  The margins were very close.  This is a close call state.  It's foolish, perhaps, to forecast an outcome before the debates. Nevertheless, I'll call it for the Republicans by about 6 percentage points.

For more info on the state's voting history: http://www.270towin.com/states/North_Carolina There are many reports of African American voter suppression (suspension of early voting in some areas, or reducing the period from 17 days to 7, or trying to eliminate early Sunday voters which is an African American tradition of taking church goers to early voting on Sundays.  Also allegations of suppression regarding voting id for African Americans.  A NC Court (don't have link but can get it if anyone is interested) said that there was no evidence of racial discrimination but that there was evidence of suppression of voters who were not Republican in the state.)  Given that high turn out by African American voters gave Barack Obama the victory in the state in 2008 is significant.   The state's governor, Pat McCrory has joined Trump and is showing up with him at rallies. It's useful to remember that North Carolina is the state banning transgenders from using bathrooms assigned to their gender identity which created much controversy along with loss of millions in business and investments. As for polls, some show Trump leading by a small percentage while others show them going neck and neck (much to my surprise, I expected Trump to be leading by a lot more points) I will have to take a look at the economic numbers in the state, the campaign operations mounted there, and any leads on GOTV, new voter registration.
