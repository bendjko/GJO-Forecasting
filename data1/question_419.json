The operation came as President Donald Trump's administration seeks Chinese cooperation in dealing with North Korea's missile and nuclear programs and could complicate efforts to secure a common stance. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the USS John S. McCain traveled close to Mischief Reef in the Spratly Islands, among a string of islets, reefs and shoals. China has territorial disputes with its neighbors over the area. It was the third \"freedom of navigation operation\" during Trump's presidency. Thursday's operation, first reported by Reuters, was the latest attempt to counter what Washington sees as Beijing's efforts to limit freedom of navigation in the strategic waters, and comes as Trump is seeking China's cooperation to rein in North Korea. China's Defense Ministry said two Chinese warships \"jumped into action\" and warned the U.S. ship to leave, labeling the move a \"provocation\" that seriously harms mutual trust. \"China is resolutely opposed to this kind of show of force and pushing of regional militarization by the U.S. that may easily cause an unexpected incident at sea or in the air,\" it said in a statement (para. 1-7).

China still calls the shots at the prime fishing spot and has boosted its fleet there, nine months after an international panel ruled its blockade of the lagoon was illegal. Beijing rejected that ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration, which invalidated China's claim of sovereignty over most of the South China Sea. But the presence of Philippine boats dotted between Chinese vessels shows a degree of compliance with the ruling. Overtures from Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who is negotiating billions of dollars\u2019 worth of loans, investments and trade deals with China, may have helped. China stopped repelling Filipino boats in October and allowed them to fish on the edges of the rocky outcrop, 200 km (124 miles) from the Philippines. Now it appears to be easing restrictions further. Reuters journalists last week entered the Scarborough Shoal itself - the first access by foreign media since China seized it in 2012 - and witnessed dozens of small boats shuttling day and night into the lagoon to capitalize on its rich fish stocks (para. 1-6).

If a passenger plane was shot down hundreds of fatalities would be possible. \nI would anticipate that this question could be the subject of arguments. There are many fatal incidents involving the military every month, they fall into three groups; equipment failures/malfunctions; personnel errors (e.g. pilot errors) and deliberate hostile or stupid acts. If for example a plane buzzed a small patrol boat and the boat in trying to avoid the plane hit another boat and people died, would that count for the purposes of this question even though the plane had not actually hit anyone. \nMy forecast is that in an area where a country's military are trying to demonstrate control where previously they did not there is a a likelihood that civilian lives will be lost every year. In this case it is a very large area, but mostly sea so the most likely casualties would be fishermen. They would not count for the purposes of the question unless they were supported by the military of one country and killed due the actions of another country (one country being China). If China continues to push its claim I would think a 3 person incident is likely every 5 years or so, which equates to a 15% chance of it happening before 1 Jan 2018.
