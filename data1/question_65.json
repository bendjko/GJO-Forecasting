The opposition needs to win all swing districts to get a majority, and the Chavista get-out-the-vote effort has historically been far superior to the opposition\u2019s. \u201cAs in previous elections, the opposition campaign has been abstract and content free,\u201d Smilde observed earlier this month. Yet Maduro\u2019s dismal approval ratings and mounting public frustration over economic hardships may obscure the opposition\u2019s failure to articulate a substantive platform. Critics warn that Maduro may resort to fraud and violence if his party loses its majority in the National Assembly. However, there is no evidence he will reject the results. In fact, as Smilde and others have pointed out, Maduro appears to be anticipating legislative losses. And some in the opposition have too often responded to losses with violence, property destruction and calls for extralegal means to achieve what they could not at the ballot box. Let\u2019s hope they are not emboldened by the efforts of Almagro and others to discredit the elections either by making unfounded allegations of fraud or by reprising the destabilizing, violent unrest that rocked Venezuela last year. Quote #2 - VE electoral system:\nVenezuelan voters use electronic machines, which print out a paper receipt that allows voters to check their choices against the electronic ballot. After voting has ended, 54 percent of machines are audited at random, in the presence of witnesses from pro-government and opposition political parties, and compared with a tally of paper receipts. The National Electoral Council (CNE) has implemented additional safeguards and audits, making the process more inclusive than ever before, with 96.5 percent of eligible Venezuelans registered to vote (compared with fewer than 76 percent of eligible Americans). With the support of the Carter Center (a nonprofit organization run by Jimmy Carter and Rosalynn Carter) and other pro-democracy groups, Venezuela has developed strong, independent national observation groups. \u201cDespite refusal of the CNE to allow substantial international observation, its relationship with domestic observers has actually improved,\u201d according to David Smilde, a senior fellow at the advocacy group Washington Office on Latin America. \u201cThey have been granted almost twice as many credentials as they had three years ago, which improves their capacity.\u201d\n---\nhttp://m.panorama.com.ve/movil/noticia.html?nota=/contenidos/2015/11/29/noticia_0012.html Comment on this article:   \nThe article is pro-Chavez.

To do that, I have to put a probability on the event that the PSUV could win a majority given the current poll numbers.  This probability can be split into two pieces: P( PSUV maintain majority fairly | poll numbers ) + P( PSUV maintain majority unfairly | poll numbers). To translate poll numbers into seats, one needs to understand the efficiency of each party's vote which I don't claim to. So using last election as a rough guide, I'll assume that with 40% of the vote the PSUV wins 50% of the seats. So now the probability we're trying to estimate becomes  P( PSUV wins 40% of the vote FAIRLY | poll numbers ) + P( PSUV wins 40% of the vote UNFAIRLY | poll numbers). For simplicity, lets call these P1 and P2, and let's start with P1:  - The average of the November polls according to wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuelan_parliamentary_election,_2015#Electoral_system)  is \nPSUV ~ 26%, MUD ~ 51%, independents (what does this mean?) ~ 11% and undecideds ~ 12%. \n- This puts the relative polling numbers (disregarding ind's and undecideds) at about 33% to 66%. So, the polls have to be off by 7% (in the right direction) for the PSUV  to hit 40%. \n- This shouldn't be more than a 1% event at best, so let's be extra conservative and set P1=2%.  Now let's examine P2:  - The question now becomes can the PSUV, through unfair tactics, sway 7% of the vote to their side (assuming the poll average is accurate). Note that tactics they have been accused of using include intimidation (e.g., killing an opposition politician thereby discouraging opposition rallies), vote rigging (which considering the discussion in the previous comments is not impossible), and playing games like running separate candidates with the same  name as opposition candidates, or having similarly named parties appear on the ballot. \n- Say intimidation moves 2% of the relative vote in their favor (say via vote suppression), and assume minimal/no vote rigging (say another 1%?), and let's say the confusing ballots work on 1-2% of the oppositions' voters. \n-Now our gap shrank from 7% to possibly 2% (assuming accurate poll averages).\n-Assume polls are right to within 2% 19 times out of 20.  \n-This puts a 5% chance that the polls are off by more than 2% and a 2.5% (say 3%) chance they are off in the PSUV's direction.  Boosting P2 (as we did P1) by 1% we end up with a 6% estimate for the PSUV. \nI had been planning to gradually move the needle on this one, but thanks to Dima K's comments (https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/50101) on a previous forecast, here it goes . \n"], [10898, "2015-11-26T22:37:44Z", [0.25], "- Latest polls have the opposition up by anywhere between 15 and 24%. This should ensure an opposition win considering that we're only 10 days away from the election. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuelan_parliamentary_election,_2015#Opinion_polls. Since we are 10 days out, I am assigning a baseline of 10% for the PSUV maintaining its majority.  - On the other hand, an opposition politician was killed today http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-34929332, potentially signaling some intimidation tactics (which may or may not backfire). I am (rather arbitrarily) increasing the PSUV's chance to 15% under the assumption that they wouldn't have done it if they didn't think it would help them (that said, one could just as easily argue that this is a sign of desperation).  - The electoral system is such that it overrepresents the PSUV (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuelan_parliamentary_election,_2015#Electoral_system). Last time around the vote was essentially evenly split but the PSUV had about 60% of the seats.

Perhaps the clearest example is the redistricting that has taken place in recent years.  Luis Vicente Le\u00f3n, whose Datan\u00e1lisis polls are closely watched, said that even if the opposition were heading into the campaign with a 20- or 30-point advantage, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily translate into more deputies.  The electoral map is set up to dilute opposition ballots. So while a candidate in a pro-government district might win a spot with 10,000 votes, a rival in an opposition stronghold might need 350,000 votes to win the seat. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough just to win,\u201d Le\u00f3n said. \u201cYou have to double the votes that your adversary might get.\u201d  As a result \u201cthe opposition might be a clear majority but may control Congress by a narrow margin,\u201d he added. \"In addition, the National Electoral Council, which is firmly under the administration\u2019s control, has allowed maneuvers that would raise eyebrows in more robust democracies.  On the December ballot, the box for the coalition of opposition parties known as the Mesa de Unidad Democ\u00e1tica, or MUD, sits adjacent to that of MIN-Unidad, which has similar colors and typeface. And while MIN-Unidad\u2019s motto is \u201cWe\u2019re the opposition,\u201d the MUD accuses it of being a ruling-party red-herring designed to sap votes.  If the move was designed to provoke confusion, it seemed to be working during the mock election.
