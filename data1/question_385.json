Competitor AT&T has acquired Direct TV and Comcast acquired NBC/Universal adding to the motivation to get the deal done. AOL, whom Verizon now owns, attempted while it was an independent company to merge with Yahoo in 2013. Now Verizon, still seeing the logic of that deal, has the opportunity to make it happen at a better price. No court in Delaware, where Yahoo is incorporated, has ever found that a material adverse effect has occurred that would allow companies to terminate a merger agreement and although there may be more damage that is latent and yet to become visible, the breach, albeit only recently reported, took place in 2014 which has allowed time for major damage to cash flows resulting from the data breach to materialize in Yahoo's financials. Lastly, there will be a renegotiation and although a price concession is the easiest form of renegotiation, due to the nature of the problem, a price concession seems less likely than a delay and/or clawback/indemnification provision. Nevertheless, regarding the price concession there is reputation to consider and given Verizon's strong position in the negotiation they will likely require some win on price to preserve reputation and this is why I believe that the deal will close but at a lower than sticker price.\n"], [31115, "2017-01-22T22:28:08Z", [0.65, 0.0, 0.25, 0.1], ""], [12879, "2017-01-22T22:27:44Z", [0.5, 0.35, 0.0, 0.15], ""], [31115, "2017-01-22T22:10:55Z", [0.65, 0.0, 0.25, 0.1], "Merges between operators and internet firms are absolutely likely given actual and forecasted market trends."], [14700, "2017-01-22T21:11:41Z", [0.3, 0.01, 0.3, 0.39], ""], [691, "2017-01-22T20:40:59Z", [0.81, 0.0, 0.0, 0.19], ""], [31756, "2017-01-22T20:19:53Z", [0.38, 0.36, 0.05, 0.21], ""], [32862, "2017-01-22T19:30:05Z", [0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1], ""], [1551, "2017-01-22T18:52:22Z", [0.25, 0.15, 0.15, 0.45], ""], [12500, "2017-01-22T18:47:58Z", [0.6, 0.2, 0.2, 0.0], ""], [9518, "2017-01-22T18:19:37Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1161, "2017-01-22T18:09:03Z", [0.85, 0.15, 0.0, 0.0], "Altaba has no reason to continue its association with the liabilities of Yahoo, thus is in a position to be induced to knock a few million off the sales price.
