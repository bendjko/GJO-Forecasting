An AR(1) GDP growth model performs well and given recent  market and macro conditions anything far from last month wouldn't be likely. So a base line of above 6.5 and below  7 makes sense. Still, GDP forecasting is wild if reported correctly so a reasonable band around last month should be considered plausible. Since above 7 is considered break neck pace and unsustainable it should be given less weight. But china might have a policy reasons to force it to be above 7 given recent international political rhetoric has ramped up. I would give 7 some weight but not too much given it's china and has a reputation (unfounded or not) of manipulating GDP growth reported numbers.  Below 6.5 hasn't been seen since mid 2009 and recent macro data wouldn't suggest this likely. So,non-zero but very low.

This is because the Chinese economy is much larger today than it was when it grew at 7% and it is much harder to get a huge relative boost at its size, even though as an absolute number the amount of growth today is far larger than it was when the Chinese economy grew faster but it's spread over a much larger economy. As other's have noted, the rate of economic growth in China is a political question. For that reason I think they government will undertake extraordinary measures to keep the economy growing at more than 6%, at least for a while. That said, I think Trump's trade policies are going to hurt the Chinese and I can envision a scenario where the Chinese government allows his trade policies to hurt growth so they can blame an external actor and use the pain to start to pass needed economic reforms in the next couple months.  Given the Chinese governments' (I refer to both the provincial and central governments here) talent for managing (the politest way I can say that)  economic statistics I have no doubt that if the central government demands a growth rate between 6.5 and 7 that most provinces will fall in that exact band, regardless of the reality.
