Security Council 'Strongly Condemns' Crackdown on Rohingya Muslims Lederer (2017) November 7, states that: UNITED NATIONS) \u2014 The U.N. Security Council unanimously approved a statement Monday strongly condemning the violence that has caused more than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims to flee from Myanmar to Bangladesh, a significant step that still fell short of a stronger resolution that Western nations wanted but China opposed. The presidential statement calls on Myanmar\u2019s government \u201cto ensure no further excessive use of military force in Rakhine State\u201d and take immediate steps to respect human rights. It expresses \u201cgrave concern\u201d at reports of human rights violations in Rakhine by Myanmar\u2019s security forces against the Rohingya. These include \u201cthe systematic use of force and intimidation, killing of men, women and children, sexual violence and \u2026 the destruction and burning of homes and property,\u201d it says. Britain initially circulated a Security Council resolution with similar language, backed by the U.S., France and other council members. But resolutions are legally binding and diplomats said China, a neighbor and ally of Myanmar, was strongly opposed. China is one of the five countries that have veto power on the council. So, Britain and France turned the resolution into a presidential statement, which becomes part of the council\u2019s record but does not have the legal clout of a resolution (para. 1-5).
