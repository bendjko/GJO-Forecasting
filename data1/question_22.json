While the Brazilian investigators must of course get their own house in order first by pursuing the politicians and local facilitators, it will be interesting to see how far they pursue the corporations that gained most from the looting of the Brazilian state enterprises. While the unwinding of these contracts will take time, they are almost certain to obtain recovery plus penalties. The amounts are enormous. Brazil would be well-advised to forgo the mass sale of assets they are currently undertaking and instead issue a special set of bonds backed by the funds recoverable under the to-be-unwound overbilled Petrobas and other state entity contracts. In addition, just as there were facilitators on the inside, an operation of this magnitude required facilitators on the outside. It will be interesting to learn of these global facilitators that orchestrated the corporate looting of the Brazilian enterprises. As a first approximation, I think it would be reasonable to assume that the entire \"excess\" debt incurred by these enterprises is a fair representation of the magnitude of the looting. Brazil state enterprises were systematically looted, and while to the average Brazilian \"Fora Dilma\" may be all that matters, the far larger and more interesting story is the global looting of Brazil. We know who was paymaster for the politicians. We know who coordinated the overbilled contracts from the inside. We know who oversaw the players on the inside.

This makes a strong argument for them, or at least Dilma, \"being around\" for a lot longer, well beyond the horizon of this question. In thinking about an inspiring article provided by @000, however, I am also thinking that we shall begin to see a new set of social phenomena that may not yet have been recognized or articulated. It may not occur in Brazil, or maybe it will. It can be generally described as an awakening to the notion that: \"Error had been routed, and now science could advance.\" I'm thinking it's a notion, still formative, seeking representation (expression) through communicative symbols. Maybe it will blossom in Brazil this week. It's a notion that, once embodied, will cause even the most ardent communist worker to pause, reflect, and say: \"They have dragged this country through three years of total crap and they were aware of the \"error\" the entire time.\" Again, think about this. An \"error\" was alleged three years ago. An epistemological error. Those in the position to correct this error remained silent, causing millions to remain in error, for three years. Maybe I am wrong, and this is not a new element in the current psyche, or not a matured element, or neither in Brazil. It probably won't happen this week. It hasn't happened for three years.

Impeachment is also a legal process, with associated rights and procedures, and therefore will not happen over night. In the case of second and third world countries, other power centers that would not be taken into account during normal times in first world countries also have to be considered, like the military.

If this is true, the fact that direct allegations have not already been leveled against Dilma may be due less to the available evidence and more to the structural limitations of the inquiry.

To my mind it would be shocking for the PT to allow Dilma to stay in office through the planned 13 March demonstrations if such demonstrations are destined to bring violence across the country. The (admittedly leaked) evidence has the benefits of kickbacks and bribery literally at the door of Lula (or, more precisely, reportedly at the door of residences in the legal title of various family members or friends yet in which Lula generally resides).

Whether the fourth in line is constitutional, and who this person might be, is unknown. Maybe there would be a need for one of these lower ranking officers to resign first to ensure their replacement could provide a succession that would last. 2) Either the personality of Dilma, or the culture of Brazil, or those two things combined, do not create a sufficiently \"honorable\" space within which Dilma will resign. [Note that the Editor of the Rio Times calls a Dilma resignation \"common sense,\" so I'm not sure where the second part of this second claim comes from.] In any case, with no sufficiently clean, readily available successors, the resignation route looks more cloudy.

The arrest of one of Rousseff\u2019s top political advisers on allegations he received $7.5 million in illicit funds has fueled speculation that the government could be toppled by cassa\u00e7\u00e3o, or the judicial revocation of Rousseff\u2019s presidential mandate. \"Unlike impeachment,. . .  the decision to rule on cassa\u00e7\u00e3o is up to the Tribunal Superior Eleitoral (TSE), Brazil\u2019s electoral court. If invoked, it would oust both Rousseff and Vice President Michel Temer, leaving House Speaker Eduardo Cunha as interim president until a new popular election could be held. \"The TSE since October has been investigating whether Rousseff\u2019s 2014 reelection campaign was funded with illicit money, which would be grounds for cassa\u00e7\u00e3o. But the February 23 arrest of Jo\u00e3o Santana, a former Workers' Party (PT) treasurer who orchestrated Rousseff\u2019s successful presidential campaigns in 2010 and 2014, raised the possibility for the first time that the TSE investigation could incorporate evidence collected under the wide-reaching Opera\u00e7\u00e3o Lava Jato (\u201cOperation Car Wash\u201d) federal investigation into graft at Petrobras. \u201cIf there is a connection between the election of Rousseff and Lava Jato, that would implode the government,\u201d said Gabriel Petrus, a political consultant at Brasilia-based Barral M Jorge & Associates who served as an adviser to Rousseff's previous chief of staff. At the very least, he added, Santana\u2019s arrest will raise the political thermometer and revive talk of impeachment proceedings.\n. . . \n\"While police said Santana\u2019s arrest is not part of an investigation into illicit campaign finance, it does have the \u201cpotential to give more robustness to allegations that [Rousseff\u2019s] campaign violated campaign finance law,\u201d according to the Washington-based political risk consultancy Eurasia Group. If the money turns out to have been an illicit campaign donation to Rousseff and the PT, it would violate electoral transparency regulations, break rules against foreign financing of elections and, most alarmingly, suggest that she won election with funds skimmed from Petrobras contracts. \u201cWe now attribute equal weight between a scenario where new elections are called this year (20 percent), and one in which Rousseff is impeached and Vice President Michel Temer finishes her term,\u201d Eurasia analysts said in a February 22 research note, giving a 40 percent probability to Rousseff not finishing her term. \"The TSE is composed of seven judges, with some seen as eager to investigate allegations filed by the opposition Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB) . . . Just as a simple majority of TSE judges could open the hearings, so can a simple majority enforce cassa\u00e7\u00e3o. \"Independent of the TSE\u2019s activities, Congress in early December opened impeachment proceedings based on accusations Rousseff\u2019s government broke fiscal responsibility laws. The proceedings, which stalled in mid-December, are expected to restart in late March after the Supreme Court makes a final ruling on how the House is to choose its 65-person impeachment committee. \"Thiago de Arag\u00e3o, director of strategy for Brasilia-based political consultancy Arko Advice, says that risk of impeachment is still higher than risk of cassa\u00e7\u00e3o, which is a much slower-moving judicial process that could see repeated legal appeals. Rousseff has so far maintained a coalition to block impeachment, but more of her public and political support will take a hit from Santana\u2019s arrest.\n. . . \n\u201cWe\u2019re on the border of changing eras in Brazil,\u201d said Arag\u00e3o. \u201cUntil recently, anyone involved in the PT was immune.

I wonder if they are implementing these additional steps. I also wonder if they have conducted any consumer research on how readers understand and utilize such estimates. Also, do they affect any aspect of story \"sentiment\" compared to word estimates? Again, there is the potential consumer benefit (presumably more accurate forecasts, more precise communication of forecast meaning), as well as the potential down-the-road benefits of forecaster evaluation. I note that this particular forecaster estimated a 55% chance.** Do such cautious forecasts diminish the value of the story? Perhaps it would depend on for whom, and how, \"value\" is defined. There are a lot of trade-offs here: forecaster accountability. sterile numbers, lack of emotive words for propaganda appeal, etc. All things considered, it seems to me, at least as far as I've considered it in the time in which I've observed it, to be a positive change that should bring multiple benefits to numerous parties. ** As I think about it, I wonder if there is not one aspect of probabilistic estimates that has perhaps not been sufficiently addressed. That is, the unsophistication of the average user of such forecasts. There is, to some degree, a cognitive burden of sorts placed upon the consumer of such forecasts. I am not saying that this is bad, only that it is there. I am of the opinion that for the average user of forecasts to obtain the intended full benefits of a numerical probabilistic forecast, they must, to some extent at least, perform a sort of reverse-engineering on the logic that the forecaster used to construct the forecast. This reverse-engineering becomes a new potential source of error. What is required is for the consumer to first undertake a step where, all things considered, they develop their own forecast. Then, the value of the numerical forecast becomes apparent in the difference between consumer forecast and forecaster estimate. If the consumer fails to properly take the initial step, the estimate may have an emotive flatness that it does not deserve, so to speak. Consider the 55% estimate of the pundit in the Reuters story. What does this 55% mean to the consumer? My point is that for it to have the intended emotive effect, the consumer must first have some appreciation for the assumed \"base rate\" that the forecaster is employing. Am I wrong to think that most consumers approach a generic odds with a base rate assumption of 50%? (^1) That is, that any and all events are as equally likely to occur as not? I know this is naive, but one needs to start somewhere. In the Reuters example, the pundit \"gave Rousseff a 55 percent chance of serving out her term through 2018.\" A required first step by the consumer would be to perform their own estimate of the estimate of the base rate, or alternatively, and less comparable class/statistical, the \"non-intervened-upon-normal-causal-trajectory.\" Although simple, I am uncertain if most consumers take even this brief time to perform this task. If they would, perhaps they might come up with a \"non-intervened-upon-normal-causal-trajectory\" of near 100% for \"Rouseff ... serving out her term through 2018,\" in which case the forecasters estimate of 55% is an absolute  difference of 45%, and that seems significant. But if they skip that step, and naively approach the odds as a random 50:50 event, as I myself admittedly did upon first reading, 55%-50%=5% doesn't seem that significant at all. A related aspect is that very often consumers are interested in the marginal effect of a particular intervention or set of interventions. In this Reuters/Rouseff example the \"non-intervened-upon-normal-causal-trajectory\" estimate of 100% neglects the \"normal\" interventions (such as natural or accidental death). The more these \"natural\" (unspecified) interventions add up, the \"value\" between a forecast and the base-rate diminishes, and it's more difficult (takes more work) to distill the value of any specific intervention under discussion, so to speak. That is, the \"story\" is typically motivated by the idea that \"this particular intervention X\" will change the \"non-intervened-upon-normal-causal-trajectory\" to such an extent that you, the consumer, should care about it. So, if the writer of the story wants to initiate an emotional response, words may still be best. If the writer of the story is willing to allow the consumer to undertake their own framing of the forecast and generate their own emotional response, the numerical forecast might be best. I don't know. Just thinking on some of these things out loud ...

I estimate her resignation as very improbable because PT would hardly turn their back on her: that would cost them their entire political capital and such \"day-after\", \"no-shield\" scenario, I guess, they cannot afford*. However, paths leading to impeachment seem more feasible to me. One of them contingent on following narrative: a) Brazilians go to the streets in massive nonpartisan demonstrations against corruption scandals involving high ranks of the government and their allies, and the strong recession that stroke Brazil in 2015. This would promote the impeachment process already in Congress. b) More high-ranking government officials or allies are arrested, as happened in November 25th, 2015, when Senator Delc\u00eddio Amaral (PT-MS) was arrested by interfering with Lava Jato -- an ongoing, high profile corruption investigation led by federal prosecutors. I assess that that would considerably refrain their popular base from organising demonstrations in support of President Rousseff. c) Lula (ex-president, public leader, and \u201c\u00e9minence grise\u201d) or his heirs are directly implicated by ongoing investigations (Atibaia farm case, Guaruj\u00e1 triplex apartment case, LFT Sport Marketing case, among many others), who have accumulated an impressive amount of wealth after PT coming to power. That, too, would considerably inhibit popular demonstrations in support of President Rousseff. d) The Lower House (C\u00e2mara dos Deputados, analogue of the US House of Representatives) expedites the impeachment process submitted to their evaluation in December 2nd, 2015, recommending the Higher House to proceed with President Rousseff's impeachment** under the legal grounds that her administration severely violated fiscal austerity laws. Since the impeachment process under the Brazilian law is predominantly a political one, public support seems more critical than having a sound legal claim. e) The Higher House (Senado Federal, analogue of the US Senate) endorses the Lower House recommendation and proceeds to approve the impeachment. To this almost incredible narrative, I will add one known fact: the next massive popular demonstration against President Rousseff has been scheduled to March 13th. Since this is step 1 of 5 in that loony narrative I happen to believe in, I deem the event \u201cBrazil's President Dilma Rousseff impeached before 1 April 2016\u201d as highly improbable. * PT cannot afford \"day-after\" scenario because they fear they would have hard times trying to find new jobs -- both low and high ranks, because private capital owners find their incompetence blatant, and workers lost their respect in them. And they cannot afford the \"no-shield\" scenario because they fear many of them (low and high ranks) would have their financial lives scrutinised by federal authorities once PT is no longer in power. ** House of Representatives recommending approval of the impeachment process, I believe, is not much contingent on having Deputado (Representative) Eduardo Cunha as President of the House, since he may loose this chair in a short timeframe because of implications of corruption raised by federal prosecutors under Lava Jato.

Most, Brazilians , 60 percent according to polling, don't understand how impeachment works.  There are articles in Folha de Sao Paulo each day to  help people \"understand\" the impeachment process. The Supreme Court also  indicates that  the final arbiter of whether impeachment goes forward or not is The Seanate, lead by Dilma's \"protector\" president of the senate Renan Calheiros. Calheiros and Cunha are both under investigation for taking bribes in the Petrobras-Lava Jato affair that is also being investigated in the US. Rousseff has had the new finance minister and heads of major state banks recalculate financial data to \"cover\" the financial \"backpeadling\" that is one of the major reason detractors are calling for her impeachment.  But this process now requires 70 billion riais, not the 57 billion that was previously proffered.  All this will come back around and create more deficit spending in the long run for Brazil.

Dec 29: \"Brazil's House to decide on impeachment by end-March: speaker\" --> http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-brazil-rousseff-cunha-idUKKBN0UC16Q20151229 Brazil's lower house of Congress will likely decide by March on whether to recommend the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff, House Speaker Eduardo Cunha said on Tuesday. Cunha, a bitter political foe of the embattled president, said he also plans to appeal recent Supreme Court decisions that raised Rousseff's prospects for blocking the impeachment process. Rousseff's opponents filed an impeachment request on the grounds she allegedly broke budget laws. The Rousseff-Cunha standoff has stalled legislation seen by investors as necessary to shore up investor confidence as Brazil's budget deficit balloons amid a deep recession. Cunha's position was weakened by Supreme Court decisions earlier this month. The justices voted to give the Senate authority to review the grounds for Rousseff's impeachment even if the lower house votes to recommend her impeachment. The justices also ruled against a lower house ballot that stacked an impeachment committee with Rousseff opponents. Cunha, who faces his own charges for alleged involvement in a giant corruption scandal involving state-owned oil company Petrobras, said the Senate is unlikely to block Rousseff's impeachment if the lower house approves it with the required two-third majority. Many analysts think Rousseff can muster the 171 lower house votes needed to quash the impeachment proceedings, but Cunha said that would not be tantamount to a sweeping political success.\n~~~ COMMENT: *likely* decide, you say?

(In fact, it sounds like those proceedings began with the long reading of the request.)  Now a committee will make a report and the plenary (the entire lower house?) will vote on whether to issue the impeachment or not. In the mean time Rousseff is filing anything she can think of with the courts to stop the train. A couple of guesses: 1. I don't think this is a timing issue. I think we'll either see an impeachment or see the proceedings stopped before April 1. The only way it drags on longer is if the courts intervene to stop the process, but if Brazil has anything like our concept of separation of powers the courts will be reluctant to do so. Probability of delay beyond April 1: 10% 2. I don't know that much about Brazilian politics, bur I don't think that the lower chamber would have accepted the request unless they though there was a pretty good chance of getting an impeachment from the plenary vote. (All that advice about not missing when you try to kill the king and whatnot.) Probability of the votes for impeachment being there: 80% 3. Given the mandatory step-down in the case of impeachment, I don't see her resigning prior to impeachment.  I'm going with 80%.

How long does this process take?  Thanks to z0k's post Dec 2, 2015 12:47PM, and the NYT article quoted above, it sounds like realistically the committee won't have a report until after New Years, and possibly much later (or never) if there is a Supreme Court injunction.  While it is theoretically possible  that impeachment may be initiated in the time-frame of this question, I think that a Supreme Court action that will freeze everything is likely, so the odds are low that it moves fast enough.  (Question:  how does something end up in the Supreme Court's docket?  Is there a vote?  What is the threshold to send something to the Supreme Court?) 2) merits.  Incompetence is not an impeachable offense.  Has she done anything that is?   This question involves the Supreme Court.  More delays. I assume that the Supreme Court has been stacked by Rousseff, so I consider the odds low that the Supreme Court will rule against her.   3)  politics.  It comes down to a vote that requires 2/3rds to pass.  Does she have the 1/3 + 1 votes to block it?    She appears to at this time . .  . but how much might her support erode during this process????

But in a perfect storm, she also has two corruption investigations, a fractious Congress and impeachment threats on her plate. \"Inflation is running at nearly 10 percent, there is a soaring budget deficit and the value of the real has fallen by 32 percent. Average wages are declining and unemployment in Brazil\u2019s six major metropolitan regions was 7.6 percent in September after years of almost full employment. And the bad news keeps on coming: In the first nine months of this year, 657,761 jobs were lost, and 1.5 million jobs are expected to disappear from Brazil\u2019s formal economy in 2015. . . . Standard & Poor\u2019s has downgraded Brazil\u2019s credit rating to junk status, and Fitch Ratings downgraded Brazil to BBB-, which places it at just a notch above junk. Corruption investigations into both Petrobras, the state-run oil company, and the construction industry already have damaged investor confidence. Dozens of members of Congress are under investigation and important corporate leaders have been jailed.  . . . the Brazilian economy is expected to shrink by 3 percent this year and by an estimated 2.1 percent in 2016 . . .  Brazil hasn\u2019t had such a dramatic economic contraction since the 1930s . . . . \"In October 2014, Rousseff was narrowly elected to her second term after a year of protests over everything from corruption, bus fare increases, poor public health services and education, to the high cost of preparing for the 2014 World Cup. Still, \u201cit\u2019s unusual to have a reelection and then so quickly be under an impeachment threat,\u201d said Eric Farnsworth, vice president of the Council of the Americas.\n. . . \n\"Rousseff won\u2019t be able to finish her term \u201cin a traditional way,\u201d said Joel Velasco, senior vice president at Albright Stonebridge Group, a Washington strategic advisory firm. \u201cIt\u2019s become more real every day. This government has failed; its policies have failed.\u201d \"He said there are four possible scenarios: \u25aa The 2014 election could be declared void if it is found that the Rousseff ticket used bribes to finance the campaign. This is the most unlikely scenario, Velasco said. An investigation into 2014 campaign donations is ongoing. \u25aa Rousseff might be impeached if it is found she used accounting tricks to lessen the severity of budget deficits. \u25aa She could quit, but Rousseff has said she has \u201cnever considered resigning.\u201d Even respected former President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has suggested she resign or issue a frank apology for her mistakes. \u25aa Rousseff could muddle through, presiding over a \u201cgovernment that is rudderless.\u201d That\u2019s the most likely scenario, according to Velasco. If that\u2019s the case, Rousseff needs to build consensus and assemble a kitchen cabinet of experts regardless of political party, he said. \"The most serious impeachment threat to date comes from a group of high-profile lawyers who say she manipulated budget accounts to hide the seriousness of budget deficits in 2014 and 2015, but there is a legal question whether she could be impeached over something that allegedly occurred during her previous term. \"Nearly two dozen impeachment requests have been filed, but the latest is not only supported by Brazil\u2019s largest opposition party, the Brazilian Social Democracy Party, but also was submitted by former Justice Minister Miguel Reale Jr. and respected lawyer H\u00e9lio Bicudo, one of the pioneers of Rousseff\u2019s Workers Party. . . . It falls to the president of the lower house, Eduardo Cunha \u2014 who himself is under investigation .  . \u2014 to decide whether to accept the request. \"If the lower house decides to accept an impeachment petition, it is put to a vote. It requires a two-thirds majority to send the petition to the Senate for a trial. Rousseff supporters say she now has enough votes from her coalition to stave off impeachment. \" . . . Cunha might not be in any hurry to push for Rousseff\u2019s impeachment. While the impeachment threat simmers, he remains politically relevant despite his own problems. \u201cThe fox guarding the hen house doesn\u2019t want to kill the chicken,\u201d said Velasco. . . .  there is no love lost between the two [Cunha & Rousseff]. \"Paulo Sotero, director of the Brazil Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center, said he expects Cunha will be expelled from Congress in the next few months. The Cunha affair must be dealt with before there is any move on impeachment, said Sotero . . . . \"An impeachment is not without precedent in Brazil. In 1992, President Fernando Collor de Mello, who was accused of accepting bribes, resigned during an impeachment process. \n. . . \n\"But Sotero said there\u2019s a new generation of prosecutors, judges and law enforcement officials who see their role as being public servants, the public is backing them up, guilty parties are going to jail and Brazilian democracy isn\u2019t in danger.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  this piece from Nov 1 seems to me to be a good summary of the situation.

If she is impeached the VP Michel Temer (PMDB) would become president and have to try to govern with presumably little support from the PT and a worsening economy and continuing corruption revelations - not attractive.    The other significant party (PSDB) whose candidate Aecio Neves was the runner-up for the presidency in 2014 would probably also prefer to mount their next campaign for the 2018 presidency against the backdrop of an increasingly discredited Roussef government. There is an outside chance that the PSDB might press and find support to have the 2014 election result set aside because of the accounting irregularities in the national accounts.    This would trigger a new election in 2016 that the PSDB would hope to win, launch some radically different (more conservative) economic policies and hope to ride an early wave of optimism with new gov't, new policies, and Olympic Games.

Complex procedural and political obstacles remain for any petition to succeed. For starters, backers of impeachment must build momentum with the notoriously fractious and unwieldy political blocs in Congress. Finding consensus among those jockeying for power in possible coalitions that would take shape in a new government could be even more difficult. \"It will not be easy to find the support you need to start the proceedings or map out a scenario for power beyond that,\" says Rafael Cortez, a political analyst at Tendencias, a consulting firm in Sao Paulo. Congress must still decide whether to act on the audit court's decision, formally censuring Rousseff and rejecting the government's 2014 books. \"Senator Eunicio Oliveira, a leader of Brazil's largest party, the PMDB, told Reuters that Congress would not get around to voting on whether Rousseff had broken the budget law before March. And the lower house speaker said a bicameral budget committee was unlikely to study the matter in 2015.\n. . .\n\" . . . At present, Rousseff could still count on about 220 of the 513 members in the lower house of Congress, enough to block any vote needed to start impeachment proceedings, according to Brasilia consultants Barral M Jorge Consultores Associados. \"Under Brazil's constitution, impeachment requests are weighed by the lower house of Congress, which must approve any petition with a two-thirds majority to launch a trial in the Senate. The Senate would have 180 days to conduct a trial, presided by the head of the Supreme Court, and would need a two-thirds majority to impeach.  . . .  \"But the success of any petition depends on support from the centrist PSDB party, Rousseff's main opposition, and the PMDB, a centre-right party that is her main coalition partner, albeit an increasingly demanding and rebellious one. They have both been unable to speak with a unified voice on the possibility of impeachment, primarily because rival blocs within each party are perceived to be angling as much against each other as they are against Rousseff. \"Neither party relishes the idea of taking over a government in crisis or having to implement unpopular austerity measures that economists say are needed to restore public finances so shaky that ratings agency Standard & Poor's last month downgraded Brazil's debt to junk status.  . . .  \"Rousseff supporters could still seek to thwart any trial through the courts, particularly by challenging technicalities.

As the political power of the Workers' Party deteriorates, other parties are likely to continue pushing for the president's impeachment over the next few months for their own benefit. Impeachment is unlikely at this point; the process is lengthy and depends greatly on the votes of individual congressmen and evidence uncovered by investigations.   \"The ruling party's political opponents, such as members of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party, have for months attempted to build public support for impeachment proceedings, but they have lacked the votes in Brazil's two-house Congress to open them. However, during the past several months, investigations against the government have advanced to the point where decisions could occur within months, thereby providing the opposition with a catalyst to again begin seeking a vote to open impeachment proceedings. \"Two investigations at separate federal courts in particular could pose a risk to Rousseff's rule. One is at the Federal Court of Accounts, Brazil's highest tribunal dealing with government accountability matters, and concerns alleged fiscal irregularities for the central government from 2012-2014. The second is at an electoral court and concerns illegal donations allegedly made to Rousseff's campaign in 2014 that were obtained by overcharging Petrobras. In a worst-case scenario, the second investigation could result in the electoral court voting to annul the 2014 election \u2014 a decision that, if the government appeals and loses, would end with the resignation of president and vice president and the head of the lower house of Congress becoming president until new elections can be held 90 days after the impeachment. The Federal Court of Accounts is slated to deliver its final opinion by mid-October. \"The case being heard before the Federal Court of Accounts alleges that the central government made irregular payments to state entities and did not follow existing regulations in crafting the country's annual budget on several occasions. If the government is found to have violated the law, the opposition parties could have a pretext to attempt to open a vote on impeachment proceedings in the lower house of Congress. The opposition can use public ire over Brazil's economy and the Petrobras scandal to gain support. \"\"The wild card in such a vote is the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party. The party is the largest in the senate and the second largest in the lower house, and for years its legislative heft has helped the Workers' Party pass legislation. The president of the lower house is the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party's Eduardo Cunha, who was allied with the Workers' Party until July when he broke away. Because Cunha faces criminal charges stemming from the Petrobras scandal regardless of whether the Workers' Party is in charge, he could either choose to accept or deny an opposition request for a vote on impeachment. If the opposition chooses to use a Federal Court of Accounts decision to attempt to open impeachment proceedings, it can circumvent Cunha by presenting a request to the lower house floor and hoping for a simple majority win with the votes of 257 or more congressmen. However, to open a proceeding and secure an impeachment through the lower house, legislators from the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party would have to defect to the opposition. \"The party has, so far, remained loyal to Rousseff. However, its priorities clearly diverge from those of the Workers' Party.  . . . it may be in the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party's interest to split from the Workers' Party despite public promises of cooperation.  . . . The parties that want to impeach the president have only 113 seats and would need at least 144 more votes to open proceedings. Consequently, defections from the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party or even from the Workers' Party are necessary to make impeachment a realistic threat. \". . .  the president's persistent low approval ratings and the risk of removal for both the president and vice president because of an electoral court decision likely influenced the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party's calculations and led it to prepare for the worst. \"Members of the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party and the Brazilian Social Democracy Party have met to discuss possible options for a coalition government if the president is impeached. For example, recent discussions on the matter resulted in the Brazilian Social Democracy Party's attempt to extract a promise from Vice President Michel Temer not to run for president in 2018 in exchange for the party's support after a Rousseff impeachment. The Brazilian Democratic Movement Party and Brazilian Social Democracy Party are far from united on the issue of a future alliance; some members of both parties oppose the plan. But the fact that such discussions are taking place suggests that both sides consider impeachment proceedings plausible and seek to take advantage of them. \"Though a presidential impeachment is far from certain, Brazil's opposition is leaning toward opening the proceedings to safeguard its political future. Over the next few months, Rousseff likely will reshuffle her Cabinet to include representatives of the Workers' Party and Brazilian Democratic Movement Party factions. This could secure the necessary votes in the lower house to deter a vote to begin impeachment. Meanwhile, the pro-impeachment camp will make its own moves to guarantee that it can begin proceedings once the Federal Court of Accounts issues a legal opinion.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  I've spent several hours in the last 2 days reading up on this question.

She and her prededecessor  \"Lula\" were the first PT or Workers party Candidates to be elected. Both were jailed and tortured under military rule and having survived breast cancer, she is a proven fighter. Social programs lke La Bolsa Familia  pay low income famlies to send and keep their childern in school. As a result, over the long run, Brazil will have eliminated illiteracy and brought health care to many millions who had none. Although Rouseff's approval ratings have gome down to 10% no rival poltical party seems to have the votes or incentive to bring an impeachmnet resulution. The Speaker of the Assembly and President of the Senate are both subject to bribery charges in  connection with the Petrobras scandal  and there is a 60% chance that each of those opponents will face separate impeachment proceedings, a 100% chance that one of those power brokers will be impeached. Plus the Vice Predident who would succeed under the constitution is from the PDMB, Rousseff and her  PT party's former coalition partner. Although the VP has lots of influence, he does not have and cannot get 2/3 of the votes in the Assembly necessary to impeach Rouseff. Proof, Rouseff's veto of approximately 18 of 23 spending bills,was sustained and her opponents could not summon the 2/3 vote required to overcome veto. Now and for forseeable future  Brazilian  Congress will be too busy with contentious legislation cutting federal spending and continuing investigations related to Petrobras scandal,  and  even  hearings on  bills impeaching  the Speaker of Assembly or the President of the  Senate. The Congress cannot even take up any other  matter until a budget is passed and other emergency economic matters are addressed.   Although extremely unpopular, with a contraction in GDP and an increase in inflation, the real has hit its historic low against dollar and commodities prices are at a record low, and demand for Brazils' exports has shrunk due to China slowdown the exonoomy is in crisis., Dilma by appointing Joaquim Levy as central bank president, Rouseff has been able to keep Brazil;s debt still rated  1 level above junk, so it can still sell necessary bonds for infrastructure. However, the Central Bank is selling some portion of over 300 million in dollar reserves to prop up value of real. This shows balance of payments crisis. Plus the Summer Olympics are coming up in 2016 and vast infrastucture and security expedtures and competent continuous management required to finish the job or Brazil will have a public relations nighmare and not just lose  tourist revenues.  So the situation is so bad in Brazil that no candidate or party can benefit from impeaching Dilma.  A rational aspiring candidate would rather run  for election in 2018 and not carry the stigma of a chaotic and divisive take over of a sinking ship of state. Even the PDMB VP and his party would rather wait to run for that office in 2018 and hope that commodity prices will rise and revenues may be  finally streaming in from sale of oil from Brazil'ss corruption plagued development of deep water Atlantic Salt Domes.  Finally as a result of a long period of military rule, the impeachment of earlier President Color de Mello which lasted a year, Brazilians may take to the streets in the millions but, consensus exists at a deeper level that the power of\n the Presidency should be transferred at this time of national crisis or any time  by a new election; not a coup or impeachment.\n.\nAs the Speaker of fhe Assembly and President of the Senate and high ranking members of the PT movement have their own criminal prosecutions and impeachments pending,  Dilma posesses residual support of millions lifted out of abject poverty by Lula and Dilma's Bollsa Familia .Within the last 2 weeks  DIlma  again showed she has a base of support in the Assembly to block any impeachment. DIlma had her her veto sustained in the Assenbly 18 out of 23 votes and has a core of over 1/3 of  the Assembly to block a vote of impeachment. No one else  wants to be President until 2018, Her strongest and most strident opponents are facing their own impeachment. There is little  chance an impeachment bill against Dilma even being introduced, there is no chance that any bill can obtain 2/3 vote of the assembly to impeach her given current PT and coalition members This does not mean that Dilma has any authority to institute any new policies, even policies required to  restructure economy, land reform, fix a broken tax system or or reform  the judicial system to the level at  which foreign  investors believe the rule of law applies. Although without legislative support for Dilma's own policies, Dilma is a competent manager and  has shown the ability to manage he country and keep sufficient order with her executive powers alone..\nUpdate 10/9/2005 WSJ last 24 hours;\"  The following day [ Wednesday] Brazil\u2019s government-accounting watchdog found that the Rousseff administration manipulated the country\u2019s 2014 fiscal accounts to mask a ballooning deficit, a potentially impeachable offense.\nThat creates the first technical legal  basis for an impeachment. No Brazilan source believes that Dilma will be impeached based on prediction. Prediction is based upon fact that no potential successor has more than a 10% chance of replacing her, and only the VP, and only if the lower house passes an impeachment motion.\nAlthough this is an agressive prediction events in the last 24 hours do not merit  a change.

The TCU, the government accounts watchdog, has criticised these so-called accounting tricks. It is expected to vote on whether to reject the accounts as early as next month.  . . . \"Mr Sampaio believes he has the 257 votes needed to get an impeachment process started. The next milestone would be a lower house vote requesting the senate to begin the formal \u201ctrial\u201d of the president. Mr Sampaio and his allies would need a two-thirds majority, or 342 seats, to get this through. \u201cThe headlines in the newspapers and on television will be: \u2018The impeachment process starts against Dilma.\u2019 After that, no one will be able to stop it, between the pressure from the population and from politics, we are confident it will be feasible,\u201d says Mr Sampaio. The process could be done and dusted by the end of this year, he says, although this timetable looks ambitious. \"A key debate in congress, however, will be how much an impeachment should be guided by legal factors and how much by politics. Mr Sampaio argues it is 90 per cent political. The fact the TCU has already identified irregularities in the public accounts is enough, he says, without any formal charges being levelled against the president. Constitutional law experts agree. If congress wants to impeach a president, it can. The only president to face an impeachment since Brazil returned to democracy from military dictatorship in 1984, Fernando Collor, was accused of corruption but never convicted.\n. . . \n\"Many lawmakers believe the president has committed enough mistakes to warrant a leadership challenge.  . . . \"Politically, Ms Rousseff has erred too, her critics say. At the start of her second term, she alienated the PT\u2019s coalition ally, the PMDB, a loose grouping of regional politicians more inspired by pork than ideology, by not sharing more power. This led to open hostility from its members, especially house speaker, PMDB powerbroker Eduardo Cunha. \"Equally damaging has been the loss of Ms Rousseff\u2019s \u201cclean\u201d image, which has been tainted by alleged corruption at Petrobras, with several coalition politicians accused of collaborating with former company directors and contractors to extract bribes and kickbacks. While she has not been accused of direct involvement, Ms Rousseff was the head of the company when much of the alleged corruption took place. This month, the PT\u2019s treasurer, Jo\u00e3o Vaccari Neto, was sentenced to 15 years in prison for involvement in the scandal, raising fresh questions over whether the party\u2019s campaign finances have been compromised by the scandal . The matter is being investigated. \u201cIf this occurred, the tenure of the president and vice-president could be annulled,\u201d says Mr Neves, an outcome that would lead to new presidential elections. \n. . . \n\". . . Ms Rousseff is fighting back. She is expected as early as Wednesday to announce a new cabinet that will share more power with the PMDB while reducing the influence of her own party. Her supporters hope this will blunt the impeachment bandwagon. \" . . .  The president\u2019s supporters point to an early victory last week when, allegedly thanks to her coalition-building efforts, congress backed away from voting for a series of measures that would have blown a hole in the budget. \"Some analysts say the real threat to Ms Rousseff\u2019s position is much closer to home \u2014 from within her own party. Conspiracy theorists argue the party\u2019s best hope of restoring former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva \u2014 himself facing questions regarding the Petrobras scandal \u2014 to power in the 2018 elections would be for her to resign and let the opposition take the blame for the economic mess. \"Six steps to impeachment\n1 Any citizen can file an impeachment petition if they believe the president has committed a high crime or misdemeanour, such as fiddling the national accounts, attempting to subvert the functioning of congress or maladministration.\n2 Eduardo Cunha, the lower house speaker, can accept the petition or archive it. At the moment he is considering such a petition against Ms Rousseff alleging she violated Brazil\u2019s fiscal responsibility law. If rejected, the opposition can put it to a vote. A simple majority of 257 of the 513 seats in the lower house is required for success.\n3 The house then sets up a special committee to look at the proposal and prepare an indictment.\n4 The house votes again, this time on whether to request that the indictment be sent to the senate for the beginning of the formal impeachment process, in essence a political trial. Two-thirds, or 342 votes, in the lower house are needed for the indictment to pass.\n5 If it passes, the president steps down for 180 days to conduct her defence. The vice-president assumes her position. If two-thirds of the senate votes to impeach her, she must step down permanently.\n6 The vice-president stays in power until the next election. \"But PT lawmakers say that while there is disagreement within the party over her austerity measures, with leftist elements opposing cuts to social programmes, they will fight to keep her in power. \u201cThe party is united behind the idea of reconstructing its political bases in the house and senate to avoid impeachment,\u201d says Marco Maia, a PT lawmaker. \"Whether this will be enough to avoid impeachment is anyone\u2019s guess. Many analysts give Ms Rousseff a more than 50 per cent chance of survival, while acknowledging that an impeachment process could quickly crystallise, and engulf her presidency.\n\" . . . most analysts judge the present uneasy truce as unsustainable. \u201cIn the next few weeks, something is going to have to give,\u201d says Jo\u00e3o Augusto de Castro Neves of Eurasia Group.\nHe says impeachment remains the most costly option for the country in terms of political instability. But with confidence in Ms Rousseff at an all-time low, impeachment is what some ordinary voters, such as Mr Lima, favour.\n\u201cWhoever comes to power won\u2019t be able to do miracles because we are in a crisis,\u201d says Mr Lima. \u201cBut to restore the image of the presidency, increase international investment, help companies recover and reduce inflation, I think it is important to remove the PT and Dilma.\u201d \"The question for Brazilian politicians is whether it would damage the country to remove an elected president for merely being unpopular, even incompetent, without her having been found to have committed a crime. Most analysts believe that to unseat Ms Rousseff via impeachment her opponents will need to prove that she manipulated the national budget to hide a growing fiscal gap to keep her party in power, or was directly involved in corruption.\n~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  \"Many analysts give her a more than 50% chance of survival .. . .\"  \n"], [691, "2015-09-30T17:12:10Z", [0.05], ""], [3412, "2015-09-30T16:24:23Z", [0.15], ""], [2938, "2015-09-30T13:00:31Z", [0.15], "Rousseff is no doubt hated but an impeachment would be constitutionally dicey.

But his party, the Partido do Movimento Democr\u00e1tico Brasileiro (PMDB), long infamous for its eagerness to ally with whoever is currently in power, overwhelmingly refused to follow Cunha\u2019s cue. Then, on August 11, Rousseff announced an accord with Senate president Renan Calheiros, in which the government agreed to controversial policy concessions in exchange for Calheiros\u2019s continued support. Cunha\u2019s position was weakened further on August 20 when the federal prosecutor\u2019s office released a long-awaited denunciation of the speaker, asking that he be tried for accepting a US $5 million bribe to help facilitate a contract for drilling ships between the state oil company, Petrobras, and the Korean-owned Samsung Heavy Industries. Meanwhile, even prominent opposition politicians appeared reluctant to support impeachment. Former President Fernando Henrique Cardoso suggested that Rousseff should resign (but not be impeached), and S\u00e3o Paulo governor Geraldo Alckmin argued that any talk of impeachment is premature. And 2014 presidential runner-up A\u00e9cio Neves, a critic of PT corruption, has himself now been named a beneficiary of bribes by the professional money launderer at the center of the \u201cLava-Jato\u201d (Car Wash) scandal (a scheme involving kickbacks paid to politicians from rigged contracts between the state-owned oil company and construction companies).\" \" . . .  the threat of an illegal impeachment has been averted \u2013 at least for the time being \u2013 . . .\" \" . . .  The question, then, isn\u2019t so much whether Rousseff will complete her term; it is whether the PT and its center-left model of commodity and credit-driven economic growth and gradual wealth redistribution will survive.\"\n~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  This represents another nail in the coffin of my \"Yes\" forecast.  I am now convinced that if she was impeached, it wouldn't occur before April 1st.  Therefore, if she leaves office it will be as a result of some extra-legal action--like resigning.   I notice that no-one mentions the military taking a side, so the threat of a coup seems minimal. Given all that she's been through, I don't see her resigning.

"], [30, "2015-09-09T18:43:13Z", [0.35], "Rousseff may be unpopular at the moment, but it does not seem likely that she will resign or be impeached in the immediate future. As Jean-Pierre points out below, the bar needed to pursue an impeachment is quite high and a large part of the governing coalition would need to turn on Rousseff to make it happen. Resignation seems like the more probable of the two options. Even then, pressure to resign seems to mostly be coming from opposition parties, rather than from within the governing coalition at the moment.  Updating strategy: dissent within the governing coalition seems like it will be the key indicator to track, as any effort to pursue impeachment or put pressure on Rousseff to resign will likely rely heavily on people within the coalition. External pressure will simply not be enough.

The quickest way to do it would be a military coup, but the question omits that possibility. Impeachment proceedings take time. The Brazilian Constitution allows for a maximum of 180 days to conclude a trial. The vote threshold is very high. Impeachment in Brazil requires a 2/3 vote in the Chamber of Deputies (513 seats). The governing coalition has 285 members while the opposition has 199. So, the opposition would need to pick up 145 defectors to get to the magic number 344. This won't happen, in my opinion, unless the corruption scandals touch her personally. Low approval ratings alone won't do it. Furthermore, Dilma's nemesis, Speaker Eduardo Cunha, the man who has the power to start impeachment proceedings against her, has himself been charged by the Attorney General with corruption. Although this development doesn't solve her political problems, it does give her a life line. Dilma is in a very weak position but has three years to recover. She is not the kind of person who will resign unless she has no choice.

A discredited leader, approved now by less than 10% of the voters, the lowest on record, Rousseff has resisted calls to step down. She has also vowed to fight attempts of removing her from office through an impeachment process, which is supported by a significant majority of Brazilians in opinion polls and could gain traction in the coming weeks.\" \"On Saturday September 5, the Federal Supreme Tribunal, Brazil's highest court, authorized the federal prosecutor's office to move ahead with investigations on campaign finance fraud involving two members of the president's inner circle, including the minister of media affairs . . . who was treasurer of her 2014 presidential campaign.\" \"During Independence Day celebrations on September 7, Rousseff conceded having made mistakes as parades turned into anti-government protests. Signs of her increasing isolation are front page news. Two weeks ago, vice-president Michel Temer, an experienced politician, gave up the mission he had accepted from the President to smooth relations between the executive and Congress, controlled by his party, the PMDB, in order to ensure passage of an economic austerity plan aimed at reintroducing fiscal discipline to federal accounts and restore investor's confidence. The last straw was a disastrous attempt by Rousseff to reinstitute a tax on banking transactions. Temer worked behind the scene to block the proposal and has since publicly expressed doubts about the president's chances of staying in office in the more than three years left in her second mandate.The statement, made at an event organized by supporters of Rousseff's impeachment, caused alarm in Brasilia and was seen as confirmation that the vice-president is positioning himself to replace the president.\" \"Rousseff's situation is made more tenuous also by the uncertainty surrounding Finance Minister Joaquim Levy. A respected liberal economist who was close to the opposition in last year's campaign, Levy accepted, last January, the difficult task of undoing the damage done by the mismanagement of economic policy during her first term.  Viewed once as an anchor of credibility in the financial markets, Levy saw his proposals to reestablish fiscal discipline and credibility to government accounts sabotaged by cabinet colleagues and blocked by Congress. In July, he was forced to revise down budget targets. The new, more modest objectives soon proved to be unreachable.\" \"On August 31, the minister endured the humiliation of submitting a budget proposal for 2016 with a projected primary deficit (before payment of interest on the mounting Brazilian public debt) the government does not know how to finance. It was an admission of failure that underlined a view shared by Rousseff's opponents and allies about the president's lack of ability to govern. Last week, Levy came close to resigning. He stayed after receiving conditional backing by leading bankers and captains of industry, who warned Rousseff that failure to reach a primary surplus of 0.7% of GDP in 2016 budget and Levy's departure would trigger a downgrading of Brazil's sovereign credit rate below investment grade and further complicate efforts to contain and reverse the crisis.\" \" . . . Massive street protests against Rousseff have been remarkably peaceful. And democratic institutions built in the thirty years since the reinstatement of democracy in the 1980s have proved resilient, particularly those related to the rule of law. \"In the past, in similar circumstances, we would be talking about names of generals,\" said former president Cardoso in an interview in which he said Rousseff's government \"is coming apart\". \"Now we are discussing names of judges, nobody that I know is proposing a coup, except a few crazies who talk about the return of the military [to power], which the military do not want.\"  \"A country once known as the homeland of impunity for those in high places, Brazil is turning itself, in democracy, into an example to others of a society capable to change and affirm the rule of law, as painful as it may be.\"\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  Rousseff has 2 sets of problems, economic and political/legal, either of which could be her undoing in this time frame.
