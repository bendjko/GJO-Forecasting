Rouhani, long known as a cautious and mild-mannered establishment insider, reinvented himself as a bold champion of reform during the election campaign, which culminated on Friday in victory with more than 57 percent of the vote. His main challenger, hardline judge Ebrahim Raisi, received 38 percent. In his first televised speech after the result, Rouhani appeared to openly defy conservative judges by praising the spiritual leader of the reform camp, former President Mohammad Khatami. A court has banned quoting or naming Khatami on air. \"Our nation's message in the election was clear: Iran's nation chose the path of interaction with the world, away from violence and extremism,\" Rouhani said. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, whose country has had no diplomatic relations with Iran since 1980, said he hoped Rouhani would use his second term to end Tehran's ballistic missile program and what he called its network of terrorism (para. 1-5).

In a briefing for reporters, interior ministry official Ali Asghar Ahmadi outlined a similar proportion of votes received. \"It's over, Rouhani is the winner,\" the source said on condition of anonymity. The pragmatist Rouhani won 21.6 million votes in Friday's hard-fought contest, compared to 14 million for Raisi, with 37 million votes counted, the source said, adding about four million more votes were still to be tallied. The interior ministry official said that with 25 million ballots certified by the authorities so far, Rouhani won 14.619 million and Raisi gained 10.125 million. He said 40 million votes had been cast, indicating a turnout of about 70 percent, roughly similar to the showing in 2013 elections when Rouhani swept into office in a landslide victory Ahmadi said final results would be announced later on Saturday. The big turnout appeared to have favored Rouhani, whose backers' main worry has been apathy among reformist-leaning voters disappointed with the slow pace of change (para. 1-8).

State television showed long queues outside polling stations in several cities and said 56 million Iranians out of the more than 80 million population were eligible to vote \"Everyone should vote in this important election ... vote at early hours,\" Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said after casting his vote in the capital Tehran. \"The country's fate is determined by the people.\" Polls close at 6 p.m. (8.30 a.m. ET), although authorities often extend voting into the evening. Ballot counting will start at midnight and final results are expected within 24 hours of polls closing, the semi-official Fars news agency said. The elections are also for city and village councils. In a warning reflecting rising political tensions amid signs of an unexpectedly close race, Rouhani urged Iran's powerful elite Revolutionary Guards, believed to support Raisi, not to meddle in the election. Suspicions that the Guards and the Basij militia under their control falsified voting results in favor of hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to eight months of nationwide protests in 2009. Dozens of people were killed and hundreds arrested, human rights groups say, in the worst unrest to hit the Islamic Republic. Raisi, 56, and Rouhani, 68, traded charges of graft and brutality on live television with an open vehemence unseen since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Both deny the other's accusations. \"From the Revolutionary Guards to Friday prayer leaders, the hard-line, unelected part of the establishment backs Raisi,\" a senior former Iranian official told Reuters. \"But it is a risky decision. It might cause protests similar to those in 2009, as different walks of the society, desiring evolution inside the establishment, have united against Raisi.\" The Guards hope that a win for Raisi will give them an opportunity to claw back economic and political power lost in Shi'ite Iran's complex theocratic and republican governing structure since 2015, when Iran struck a nuclear deal with world powers that brought it out of international isolation (para. 1-12).

I still think that's unlikely in the broad scheme of things, because of what happened in 2009 when similar things were alleged, and the Arab Spring probably convinced hardliners that a big popular uprising isn't great even though the Iranians are probably better coup-proofed, but it still could happen.

Rouhani is donning a reformist mantle in an effort to attract the votes of disillusioned youth and to defeat conservatives who have coalesced around a single candidate. Rouhani, who won the presidency in 2013 in part because he faced a divided conservative field, now confronts one main opponent. . .  \"In a poll taken before Qalibaf\u2019s withdrawal, the Washington based IPPO Group found that 53 percent of likely voters would vote for Rouhani, 23 percent for Qalibaf and 22 percent for Raisi. Three candidates did not have significant support, including Es\u2019haq Jahangiri, Rouhani\u2019s vice president, who withdrew Tuesday in favor of Rouhani. \"While the polling may have provided the Rouhani camp with some encouragement, any optimism should be tempered with caution. A quarter of the respondents were undecided and 22 percent did not disclose a preference. The Qalibaf withdrawal adds new uncertainty to the election outcome. \"It is likely that a major portion of Qalibaf\u2019s supporters will gravitate toward Raisi . . .  Given that the combined percentage of those preferring Qalibaf and Raisi closely tracked that for Rouhani, the conservatives have a chance to push the contest to a run-off and beat Rouhani in a second round. \"The conservatives are counting on help from Iran\u2019s national television and radio, which are controlled by the hardliners. The two organizations have been doing everything in their power to harm Rouhani and promote Raisi. For example, they selectively broadcast the replay of the candidates\u2019 debates, made negative comments regarding Rouhani\u2019s statements and presented \u201canalysis\u201d over who had the upper hand that took the side of Rouhani\u2019s rivals in an obvious manner.\n. . . \n\"Social media and various computer apps that are popular among Iranians are providing a venue for the Rouhani campaign to fight back and present alternative messages.\n. . . \n\"The conservative establishment has also sought to excommunicate former president Mohammad Khatami, who was labeled as one of the leaders of the \u201csedition\u201d \u2013 the name given to the Green Movement by the conservatives. The official Iranian media has been banned from publishing statements and images of Khatami but that has not stopped the former president from broadcasting an endorsement of Rouhani through cell phone apps and social media. \"Khamenei drew a red line stating that whoever supported the seditionists could not be given any responsibility in the power structure. \u201cMy positions about the sedition of the [Iranian calendar] year 1388 [2009] are fully clear and I am sensitive to this issue, and the yardstick is refraining from supporting those who spearheaded the sedition or those who took advantage of it and have not yet disavowed it,\u201d he remarked in 2016. \"Taking a high risk, Rouhani has verbally crossed Khamenei\u2019s red lines during his campaign. In his May 13 remarks, Rouhani said, \u201c[During my presidency] I only wrote one letter to the judiciary. In that letter, I asked, based on which law and which rationale, have you banned Khatami appearing in the media?\u201d To the cheers of his supporters, Rouhani added, \u201cThe reform [movement] will not be isolated. \u2026 Let us say hello to reform. Let us say hello to Seyyed Mohammad Khatami.\u201d\n. . . \n\"Rouhani appears to be hoping that he can mobilize undecided voters by taking this pro-reformist stance. However, many Iranians may question the depth of Rouhani\u2019s convictions and his ability to challenge deep state institutions in a second term, when Iranian presidents are traditionally weaker than in their first terms. \"The president\u2019s approach also risks further alienating low-income voters. While a large faction of society struggles financially and unemployment, particularly among the youth, is rampant, Rouhani has said that his campaign slogan is, \u201cFirst, freedom of speech, second, security, and third, development.\u201d \"This is in sharp contrast to the strategy adopted by Raisi, who has adopted a populist stance concentrating on the income gap and offering to triple cash subsidies to the poor. The approach may be economically unrealistic \u2013 parliament speaker Ali Larijani has said that economy cannot afford it -- but could buy a significant number of votes in rural and poor urban areas given widespread disillusionment with the economic benefits brought by Iran\u2019s nuclear agreement with world powers. \"In an April poll, in response to the question of \u201cto what degree President Rouhani has or has not been successful in resolving the country\u2019s economic problems?\u201d 37 percent thought that he was somewhat successful, while 55 percent believed that he was somewhat or very unsuccessful.\n"], [1034, "2017-05-18T04:42:33Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [31150, "2017-05-18T04:00:50Z", [0.85, 0.15, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [35649, "2017-05-18T02:37:20Z", [0.75, 0.2, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [35649, "2017-05-18T02:36:27Z", [0.25, 0.5, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0], "Honestly i dont know anything about Iran politics "], [35642, "2017-05-18T01:07:45Z", [0.69, 0.31, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [34353, "2017-05-17T22:42:25Z", [0.92, 0.08, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [35657, "2017-05-17T21:29:47Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [14777, "2017-05-17T21:05:42Z", [0.72, 0.28, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [3577, "2017-05-17T20:03:23Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [34628, "2017-05-17T19:49:01Z", [0.66, 0.34, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [241, "2017-05-17T19:33:59Z", [0.94, 0.06, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [14777, "2017-05-17T18:09:46Z", [0.66, 0.34, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [25265, "2017-05-17T17:11:37Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "Well, today is the last day that the candidates could officially advertise.

Seeking a second term, pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani, 68, remains the narrow favorite, but hardline rivals have hammered him over his failure to boost an economy weakened by decades of sanctions. Many Iranians feel a 2015 agreement he championed with major powers to lift sanctions in return for curbing Iran's nuclear program has failed to produce the jobs, growth and foreign investment he said would follow. The normally mild-mannered cleric is trying to hold on to office by firing up reformist voters who want less confrontation abroad and more social and economic freedom at home. In recent days he has adopted robust rhetoric, pushing at the boundaries of what is permitted in Iran. He has accused his conservative opponents of abusing human rights, misusing religious authority to gain power and representing the economic interests of the security forces. Rouhani's strongest challenger is hardline cleric Ebrahim Raisi, 56, who says Iran does not need foreign help and promises a revival of the values of the 1979 Islamic Revolution. He is backed by Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards, the country's top security force, their affiliated volunteer Basij militia, hardline clerics and two influential clerical groups. Another prominent conservative, Tehran Mayor Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, withdrew from the race on Monday and backed Raisi, uniting the hardline faction and giving Raisi's chances a boost. Under Iran's system, the powers of the elected president are circumscribed by those of the conservative supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has been in power since 1989. All candidates must be vetted by a hardline body. Nevertheless, elections are fiercely contested and can bring about change within the system of rule overseen by Shi'ite Muslim clerics (para. 1-10).

He ran in 2013 promising to reinvigorate the economy by forging the nuclear deal, ending or easing sanctions that cut Iran off from international finance and opening the country to foreign investment and ideas.  He accomplished the nuclear pact, but the economic benefits have been meager at best.

After roughly 20 years of the internet, satellite television and affordable foreign travel, Iranians have grown more sophisticated, educated and moderate, and less pious.  Iran\u2019s aging leaders have been forced to give ground, tolerating changes they can no longer prevent.

Iran's hard-line security and judicial powers, which operate separately to the presidency and are close to Iran's ultimate authority - Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei - have banned media from publishing Khatami's image or mentioning his name.

We have resolved some problems and bigger problems remain for us to resolve on this difficult path with him,\" Khatami said in a video message released on social media. \"It is now your turn to renew your vote for our dear Rouhani in order to strengthen hope for a better future,\" he said.

The 12th presidential election after the 1979 Islamic Revolution is set to be held on May 19th. Yet the results of this round of election are as difficult to predict as the previous rounds in the country that took the world as well as the nation by surprise.   \"In 1997 presidential election, Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, the then speaker of the Iranian parliament who appeared to have the support of the establishment, lost to Mohammad Khatami against all odds. In a turnout of almost 80 percent, he only received 25 percent of the votes while his rival obtained nearly 70 percent of the ballots, winning the election in a landslide. Eight years later, the less known mayor of Tehran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad defeated prominent candidates such as former Iranian president Hashemi Rafsanjani and Mostafa Moeen, one of Khatami\u2019s cabinet members, thus becoming the 6th president of Iran. His presidency lasted for eight years as he won the 2009 election. \"The 2013 presidential election also took the world by surprise when Hassan Rouhani, the then member of the Supreme National Security Council, narrowly triumphed over Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf and four other candidates by securing nearly 51 percent of the votes. His victory was unpredicted as many expected the election to go to the second round since none of the candidates appeared to be able to garner the majority of votes during the first round. \"Election polls in Iran have seldom been reliable as they were mostly designed based on the preferences of the organization requesting the poll, which led to unreliable and incorrect results. Therefore, none of the polls predicted Ahmadinejad\u2019s victory in 2005 presidential elections against his powerful rivals and few surveys were able to foresee Rouhani winning the election in the first round. Although several of foreign polls had predicted the increase in Rouhani\u2019s support among Iranian people as the campaign period was drawing to an end. \"The same problem plagues the presidential race in Iran in 2017 as well as no one seems to be able to offer a reliable forecast about the result of May 19th vote, although all Iranian presidents have served two-terms so far. However, some of them faced various difficulties during their second term including Rafsanjani and Ahmadinejad. The former lost majority of his base while the latter encountered oppositions following the protests to the result of 2009 election. It seems that Rouhani is also facing many obstacles on his path towards securing the second term of his presidency. While he was considered the uncontested victor of the election until a few months ago, the candidacy of Tehran\u2019s mayor Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf and Ebrahim Raisi, a powerful conservative cleric has caused some concerns in Rouhani\u2019s camp. \"Rouhani\u2019s main rivals have focused their criticism on the Achilles heel of Rouhani\u2019s government, namely economic problems in the country including stagnation, flagging productive section and remaining sanctions imposed against Tehran. However, they have not been able to produce a strategy or comprehensive plan to resolve the pressing economic issues, merely focusing their campaign on criticizing the shortcomings of the government. \"The lack of coherent strategy in the camps of Qalibaf and Raisi as well as the problems plaguing Rohuani\u2019s cabinet has made it difficult to predict the result of Friday\u2019s vote, though it seems that the incumbent president is facing a tough race as his rivals are aiming for a two-round election. If none of the candidates can secure a decisive victory on May 19th, a run-off will be held shortly after and Rouhani has to compete with either Qalibaf or Raisi. The looming possibility of a two-round election has increased the difficulty of predicting the results of Friday\u2019s vote.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  I am trying to not be negative and over-reactive, but I am very worried about Rouhani.

[http://www.belfercenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/files/Iran%20Elections%20-%20web.pdf] If we look at last year's parliamentary elections, in which the moderates did quite well, turnout was 2% higher than normal. Also, in places like Tehran where turnout was roughly 50%, the Republicans (Iranian moderates) did extraordinarily well, winning every seat up for grabs. \nA couple things that could tip the scales: the Ayotollah coming in hard for a candidate. The candidate he's most likely to do so for, if he did, would be Ebrahim Raisi, as they reportedly are quite similar in viewpoints. But the issue here is that if Ebrahim Raisi lost anyways, which TBH is likely, even if Ghalibaf drops out and favors him, the Ayotollah would be embarassed, and because Raisi is reportedly his preferred successor, he would also de-legitimatize him. I think it's too risky. Another thing that might harm his chances is that if in the upcoming visit to Riyadh by Prez. Trump, something particularly hawkish is said/planned. If the relations are too antagonistic, this could push the electorate to the right. But especially because of the dangers of doing so, I think that Gen. McMaster and SecDef Mattis will be strongly cautioning against this. A strong statement against Iran could be intended to direct attention away from the Comey hubbub, but in the broad scheme of things, I doubt that anything too antagonistic will be said considering that Trump isn't really planning on doing any big speeches right now.

Rouhani, first elected in a landslide four years ago on a promise to reduce Iran's international isolation, is trying to hold on to office by firing up reformist voters disillusioned by a stalled economy and the slow pace of social reform. Although he has long cast himself as an insider and pragmatist rather than a gung-ho reformer, he seems to have shed that moderate image in recent days, seeking to energize voters who want less confrontation abroad and more freedom at home. In three hours of blazing exchanges with his rivals, he took on targets once seen as all but untouchable, including the judicial establishment and the Revolutionary Guards, the elite military force that controls much of Iran's economy. \"Mr. Raisi, you can slander me as much you wish. As a judge of the clerical court, you can even issue an arrest order. But please don't abuse religion for power,\" Rouhani said at one point to his main hardline rival, Ebrahim Raisi, a judicial official and protege of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. \"Some security and revolutionary groups are busing people to your campaign rallies ... Who finances them?\" said Rouhani at another point. He cast his other main rival, Tehran Mayor Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, a former Guards commander and police chief, as a thug who had boasted of personally taking on young demonstrators. \"You wanted to beat up students,\" Rouhani said. The two main rivals mostly hammered Rouhani's record on the economy, arguing that jobs have been lost and prices have risen despite the 2015 agreement Rouhani reached with global powers to lift sanctions in return for curbing Iran's nuclear program. Raisi said 250,000 small businesses had shut and cash payments to the poor should be raised: \"Unemployment is high. People's purchasing power has dropped dramatically,\" he said (para. 1-10).

Jahangiri is also a close ally of Mohammad Khatami who has publicly endorsed Rouhani for this years elections.  \u201cRouhani has pushed his liberal credentials, attacking the security services for interfering in peoples lives, and posing with women wearing loose and colourful headscarves that are still opposed by hardliners despite becoming commonplace in wealthier parts of Tehran\u201d (http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/rouhani-attacks-conservative-rivals-saying-era-violence-and-extremism-over-498716983). This shows Rouhani\u2019s attempt to reach out to female voters, something that hardliners might lack; he is due to address a women\u2019s rally tomorrow.  In an Iran poll survey in April 42% of respondents cited unemployment as the most important issue in the election. To appeal to the people voting on this topic: \u201cGhalibaf has described himself as the candidate of the \u201c90% against the 4%\u201d promising monthly cash handouts of $77 for any unemployed Iranian aged 18 or above.\u201d (http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=82988) \nHowever, I think it would be fair to say that most people aren\u2019t looking for handouts but instead looking for the candidate who is promising more jobs. This is my personal opinion, but I think the young generation of Iranians would be looking for a similar thing.  It appears that religion could be one of the signifcant factors in determining the outcome of the election. \u201cThe Supreme Leader Khamenei criticised the government of Hassan Rouhani for promoting a \u2018western influenced\u2019 UN education plan.

Looking at the previous election results (which is probably the best predictor of this one), Rohani wiped the floor with Ghalibaf. Ebrahim Raisi, aside from potentially being the favorite of the Ayotollah, doesn't have a whole lot of other things going for him. Look at the amount of people that don't know him in the poll [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_Iranian_presidential_election,_2017] The FA article suggests that Rohani has gotten an increasing amount of support across the political spectrum. He won handily in 2013, and especially with the huge leap in Iranian economic growth, and with the courting of conservative factions, I think it would take a miracle, or some shady business, for Ghalibaf to come close. This is a more cautious estimate than some of the others for a few reasons: I think that the Raisi camp is going to fold and go for Ghalibaf sometime soon. While Raisi is reportedly more favorable with the Supreme Leader, as mentioned earlier, nobody knows who he is. While I still think that Ghalibaf has meager chances, in part due to the fact that many Iranians surely associated recent successes with Rohani, that boost could be useful. I do not think, as some have suggested, that Ghalibaf will drop in favor of Raisi. He has been gaining steam lately, but I simply doubt he can gain enough steam to paint himself as a credible alternative to Ghalibaf within a few weeks. If that changes, I'll update. What worries me about my forecast (and I daresay personally worries me) is some kind of aggressive statement by the Trump administration could bolster support for hardliners.

A report by the semi-official ILNA did not elaborate but a Rouhani campaign official confirmed to The Associated Press that state TV had cut parts of \u201cPresident Rouhani\u201d. He said one censored segment showed supporters chanting for opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi, who has been under house-arrest since 2011 and whose Green Movement hard-liners oppose. Also omitted was a picture of former President Mohammad Khatami, whose name and image have been banned in Iranian media since 2015. He said state TV also cut out a remark by a student in which he said Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei supported the 2015 landmark nuclear deal between Iran and world powers. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief reporters. The documentary was a collection of Rouhani\u2019s past speeches, on various issues, during his visits to various provinces. State TV did not immediately provide any comment. Earlier this week Khatami announced his support for Rouhani, and Mousavi is also considered a Rouhani supporter. The moderate Rouhani, who vowed to lift Mousavi\u2019s house arrest in his 2013 campaign, is running in the May 19 election against five other candidates. That promise remains to be fulfilled. In a separate report, the official IRNA news agency published the results of a Monday survey in which nearly 64 percent of a 6,047-person sample group said they will be voting, while 20 percent said they were undecided. It added that some 55 percent had already decided on their candidates; 45 percent said they support the moderate-reformist camp, while more that 23 percent supported the conservative hard-liner groups. Additionally, the survey asked where they would seek guidance for their vote; some 50 percent said they would decide for themselves, 16 percent said they would follow the lead of friends and relatives in making their decision, 14 percent said they would refer to clerics, 13 percent to political groups, six percent to university students and academics, and 1.3 percent said they would emulate artists and athletes (para. 1-10).

Rouhani was elected by a landslide in 2013 on pledges to end Iran's international isolation that had crippled the economy and to ease restraints on society in the Islamic Republic. He seeks re-election on May 19 against hard-line rivals, though even supporters voice disappointment at his performance in office. In a debate in Tehran carried live on state TV, Rouhani battled criticism that few Iranians had enjoyed any tangible benefits from the 2015 deal under which Iran curbed its disputed nuclear activity in exchange for relief from global sanctions. \"What has changed since the deal? What has changed in the day to day lives of our people?\" said hardline candidate Ebrahim Raisi, one of four sharia (Islamic law) judges who oversaw executions of thousands of political prisoners in the 1980s. However, all of Rouhani's opponents in the debate said they accepted the nuclear pact as \"it was a national accord\". Another conservative candidate, Tehran Mayor Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, also a former commander in Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards (IRGC), accused Rouhani of failing to tackle unemployment estimated at 12-20 percent. In response, Rouhani said Iran's reconnection with the global financial system after most sanctions were lifted had already borne fruit in renewed oil exports and was sure to yield jobs and investment boosting the economy in coming years. \"All the nuclear-related sanctions have been lifted. Today, we export 2 million barrels oil per day. Without the deal it would be reduced to 200,000 bpd,\" said Rouhani. Rouhani accused unnamed hardliners of trying to derail the nuclear deal, reffering to a ballistic missile launch in 2016 by the IRGC in which \"Israel must be wiped out\" was written on the missiles, according to Iranian media. Iran\u2019s overall economic outlook has improved since the nuclear accord. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts between 4 and 5.5 percent growth in 2016, well up from the 1.3 percent it forecast before the deal was clinched. Raisi and Qalibaf have vowed to created millions of jobs a year, if elected, though they have not said how they would do so and economists have called such promises \"unrealistic\"(para. 1-11).

President Hassan Rouhani, a Shiite cleric considered a relative moderate on the Iranian political spectrum, is facing increasing pressure from hard-liners to show the payoff from the agreement struck with the U.S. and five global powers in 2015 to curb its nuclear programs in exchange for the lifting of harsh economic sanctions. While reformist parties say the May 19, contest will be a sham because hundreds of moderates and all female candidates have been blackballed by Iran\u2019s Guardian Council, the stakes are incredibly high for Mr. Rouhani, who came to power in 2013 vowing to counter the influence of the country\u2019s religious and military hard-liners and ease Iran\u2019s international isolation. Regional analysts and U.S. officials say the 68-year-old sitting president, who fought for the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal and spent much of his first four-year term pushing for a diplomatic and economic opening with the West, could lose his re-election bid to a relatively unknown conservative cleric named Ebrahim Raisi. Mr. Raisi is a close ally of Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is said to be dissatisfied with Mr. Rouhani\u2019s handling of relations with the West and is eager to for him to be replaced by a more confrontational character capable of responding to the more assertive approach from Washington under President Trump.\nThe big question, analysts say, is whether Iranian voters will come out in force behind Mr. Raisi or his conservative (para. 1-6).

Under Rouhani's tenure, Iran brought renewed investment interest to a country that saw sanctions pressures ease as a result of a U.N.-backed multilateral nuclear agreement. In November, the country, a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, became the only party to an effort to balance an over-supplied crude oil market that's allowed to produce more oil in order to regain a market share lost to those sanctions. Ali Khamenei, the conservative ruling cleric in Iran, has called for a so-called resistance economy, one that limits exposure to international market shocks and sanctions pressures in part by weaning itself off oil for revenue.

He now faces serious competition from hardliners, some of whom are close to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has criticized Rouhani's economic record, saying his detente with the West and concessions on Iran's nuclear work had yet to yield economic benefits. \"We will not let them bring the security and police atmosphere back to the country,\" Rouhani told a rally in the city of Yazd, according to the semi-official Tasnim news agency. \"Iranians will prove to the world at the May 19 election that the era of violence, extremism and pressures in our country is over and Iran is pursuing the path of reason.\" Among Rouhani's challengers are Ebrahim Raisi, an influential cleric with decades of experience in the hard-line judiciary, and conservative Tehran Mayor Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, a former Revolutionary Guards commander (para. 1-6).

Rouhani, a pragmatist whose election in 2013 led to a diplomatic thaw between Iran and the West, championed in 2015 a landmark deal in which Tehran agreed to curb its nuclear activities in return for lifting of international sanctions.

In comments that appeared to favor hard-line candidates in the May 19 vote, Khamenei played down the benefits of Rouhani's landmark agreement to curb Iran's nuclear activities in return for a lifting of international sanctions. \"Some say since they took office the shadow of war has been faded away. This is not correct,\" Khamenei was quoted as saying by state media. \"It's been people's presence in the political scene that has removed the shadow of war from the country.\" Khamenei and his hard-line supporters have also criticized the nuclear deal -- which stiffled talk by Washington of possible military action against Iran -- for failing to deliver promised economic benefits. But speaking at the opening of a refinery that Iran says will make it self-sufficient in oil products, Rouhani defended his position (para. 1-8). Sharafedin, B. (2017).

At the same time, Iran\u2019s Election Commission announced that it received complaints from four candidates in the presidential elections because of the issues witnessed in the first debate.

Raisi, 56, is a hard-line cleric known for his ultra-conservative stances and great proximity with Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. He arrived at the registration committee center for presenting his candidacy papers a few hours after \u2018moderate\u2019 Rouhani had applied in hopes of winning over a second term in office. Raisi showed up at the center accompanied by a number of mothers who had lost their children to wars fought by Iran, said Tehran-based media outlet Tasnim. When presented with a copy of the Quran and Iran\u2019s flag, Raisi accepted the gesture before dozens of flashing cameras that documented every step of him submitting his documents, but he made no statements, Tasnim added. However, a few days earlier, Raisi said that his candidacy is an effort to salvage the country from \u2018chronic structural disease\u2019 and incorrect administrative traditions. Raisi is a hardline judge who spent years in powerful backroom positions before emerging as a leading challenger for Iran\u2019s presidential election next month. In 1985, he became a deputy prosecutor at the Revolutionary Court of Tehran in the midst of the Iran-Iraq war when thousands of political prisoners were executed. Raisi spent a decade as head of the Inspection Office from 1993, followed by 10 years as deputy head of the judiciary. In 2006, he was elected to the Assembly of Experts that has powers to choose the next supreme leader, and now sits on its board of directors. In 2012, he became a prosecutor in the Special Court of Clerics, charged with disciplining the clergy, and spent two years as Iran\u2019s nationwide prosecutor-general from 2013 to 2015 (para. 1-9).
