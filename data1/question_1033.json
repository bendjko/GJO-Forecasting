Under the magnitsky act, the administration as 120 days to respond to the request - meaning a response is due by 20 March 2019. This lies just outwith the range of the forecasting question, but of course a response can be submitted earlier. Its also worth noting that despite the oft-reported partisan divide in the US, there is actually a decent degree of consensus within Congress on the need for Saudi Arabia (or, rather, the crown prince specifically) to be punished for this. This includes the Republican controlled Senate both now and after the Democrats take over in the House.

However, the quid pro quo in this case for the Trump administration is Saudi keeping oil prices low, which seems to be that all Trump cares about (the weapons stuff is a distraction). Saudi had kept production high in anticipation of declining Iranian output as a result of the re imposition of US sanctions but the US waivers sent prices dovetailing (as well as a supply glut). Now oil prices still remain low but OPEC cuts may lead to higher prices in the new year - we will see (anything above 70 dollars per barrel on Brent seems to set trump off).

The moves would impose a limited punishment on the kingdom. The steps appear calibrated to respond to international outrage over the death of Mr. Khashoggi and to thousands of civilian deaths in the Yemen war, but avoid directly punishing the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, and could head off tougher congressional action. ...The Trump administration is also expected to soon announce economic sanctions against Saudi officials linked to the murder of Mr. Khashoggi, according to current and former officials. They said senior officials at the White House and State and Treasury Departments had discussed imposing the sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Act, which gives the executive branch the power to punish foreign officials involved in human rights abuses. The announcement could come in days. Last week, Mr. Mattis and the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, called on all sides in the war to end hostilities and take part in United Nations-led negotiations. But Saudi leaders did not immediately move to limit their airstrikes, angering some in the Trump administration, according to former officials. \u201cThe Saudis have escalated; they have intensified the war,\u201d said Bruce Riedel, an expert on Saudi Arabia at the Brookings Institution. \u201cIt is a very public rebuke of both the secretary of state and the secretary of defense by the Saudis. The administration has not said anything about that. But curtailing air refueling would be their response.\u201d...The administration has faced growing bipartisan criticism over the American military\u2019s support for the Saudi campaign.

Obtained exclusively by Vox, the bill \u2014 nicknamed the \u201cNo Nuclear Weapons for Saudi Arabia Act of 2018\u201d \u2014 if passed would be the strongest rebuke to Saudi Arabia yet since the uproar over Khashoggi\u2019s fate.  ...President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he doesn\u2019t want to jeopardize money coming into the United States, and some members of Congress privately worry that stopping weapons shipments to Saudi Arabia might negatively impact jobs.  So instead of doing that, Rep. Brad Sherman (D-CA) wants to stop a major nuclear deal between the US and Saudi Arabia that\u2019s been under negotiation for months, and which he has long railed against. \u201cI don\u2019t think this bill would\u2019ve passed prior to the events in Istanbul,\u201d Sherman told me. \u201cNow I think we have a chance.\u201d It\u2019s also very possible a Republican will co-sponsor the bill when it\u2019s officially introduced in the next 10 congressional days.   ...Sherman\u2019s bill could completely block Saudi Arabia\u2019s plans to obtain nuclear technology from the United States, especially since there\u2019s growing bipartisan support to reprimand Riyadh over Khashoggi.  It would come as a big blow to Saudi Arabia: Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom\u2019s de facto ruler, more commonly known as MBS, launched a project on Monday to build his country\u2019s first nuclear research reactor.   ...But Rep. Sherman\u2019s bill, if passed, would require Congress to vote in favor of the deal to happen. And if Congress chose not to vote on the agreement, the nuclear accord would also die. ...It\u2019s possible that US firms won\u2019t win the contracts, Kingston Reif, a nuclear expert at the Arms Control Association, told me, in part because Riyadh can get what it needs with fewer restrictions elsewhere.  The Saudis, for example, could turn to Russian or Chinese bidders if they\u2019re rebuffed by the US. Analysts say the Russians and Chinese will probably be less intent on restricting Saudi Arabia\u2019s enrichment or reprocessing ambitions. For that reason, some argue that Washington might have to consider a compromise with Riyadh \u2014 a plan that wouldn\u2019t curb the country\u2019s path to a nuclear bomb \u2014 in order to sign a deal. ...There\u2019s legitimate concern about what Riyadh would do with a brand new nuclear reactor if this indeed happens.  On March 18, MBS openly admitted on CBS\u2019s 60 Minutes that obtaining a nuke was a possibility. \u201cSaudi Arabia does not want to acquire any nuclear bomb, but without a doubt, if Iran developed a nuclear bomb, we will follow suit as soon as possible,\u201d he said.  Iran is Saudi Arabia\u2019s key rival in the Middle East, and they\u2019ve made gains toward obtaining a nuclear weapon in past. Saudi Arabia is worried Iran could use its civil nuclear program to make weapons in the future, and tip the balance of power in the region in its favor.  There are other signs that Saudi Arabia\u2019s burgeoning nuclear program is really all about weapons \u2014 and not mainly for energy \u2014 like it repeatedly says. One possible indicator is that Riyadh has focused on nuclear energy and not renewable energy to bring power to its millions of citizens. ...That\u2019s led to major suspicions that Riyadh wants a pathway to building nuclear weapons. If that\u2019s the case, the US may soon help them. And if not, the Gulf monarchy may still get that assistance elsewhere. That means a nuclear arms race in the Middle East between two regional powers may be on the horizon \u2014 with or without America\u2019s input. https://www.vox.com/2018/11/9/18072660/saudi-arabia-nuclear-deal-congress-123-agreement-sherman https://www.defenseone.com/politics/2018/10/us-military-leaders-keep-quiet-saudi-arabia-amid-khashoggi-outrage/152082/\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/charlestiefer/2018/10/14/ten-reasons-saudi-arabia-had-no-concern-about-trump-in-slaying-khashoggi/#2b0c6a6930e2\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-administration-appears-in-no-hurry-to-judge-saudi-arabia-for-khashoggi-killing/2018/11/02/86f79544-ddfd-11e8-85df-7a6b4d25cfbb_story.html?utm_term=.b170308df5fd\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-45906396\nhttps://www.saudiembassy.net/ministries I think the US is working very carefully to do what it is in it's best immediate interests - politicians to back a bipartisan criticism of behavior in another country that distracts against midterms and the public will generally support (or not criticize them for), the military to limit public criticisms of KSA and actions in question to very specific parameters and reassert that the US will likely to something maybe soon, the President's administration to the kinds of criticisms they can while redirecting official state action to things that don't endanger MBS and public officials, and the President himself to dismissing the role of MBS and following the official line in KSA that it was a rogue action by military/intelligence and other insiders not acting officially.  Given the issue of the arms sale and it's specific introduction by MBS in the last week (when he's been threatening for months or longer to pursue nuclear weapons if Iran does) and the very late last night response from the Trump administration to take real action that is nevertheless limited and redirected away from MBS, KSA and official US-Saudi relations, I think it likely that the Trump administration will succeed and pull republicans with them.  Sanctions, if made, would be directed toward individuals MBS identified for the fall.  Even if they name those Turkey has identified as part of the operation (which they may or may not, as Trump has insisted the US will do it's own research and not rely on other countries' intelligence), none of them yet are connected to Council of Ministers in any publicly-divulged way.

It would also weaken Washington's strategic position in the region and offer an opening to rival powers (CNN). For President Trump, his reluctance thus far has shown his desire to not break any ties with Saudi Arabia. Pressure is also on congress to psuh for these sanctions, but there is no way in telling if they are willing to push the president in this direction.

Every financial institution will close their account, and they will be denied entry to every desirable area in the world.\" By using the sanctions, all the work Trump put in to create such close transactional ties with Saudi leadership will be gone, and future ties between the US and Saudi Arabia will also suffer greatly as the royal family will not side with President Trump. Moreover, Trump has made statements making it clear he does not want to damage the transactional ties with Saudi Arabia, and that economics etc are more important that human rights.
