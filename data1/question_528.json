S&P have said they're probably going to follow the regular review schedule but have not said when the next review for China will be. The previous three have been: Jul 31 2008, Dec 16 2010 and Mar 31 2016 (https://tradingeconomics.com/china/rating) . Admittedly this does not give a whole lot of information. Earlier annual updates were given so I suppose those are not out of the question either. In fact, one could argue that the reason S&P are following their regular schedule IS that they have an update schedule for this year already. In the current state, I think it is quite possible that S&P will reduce the rating whenever they have the next update scheduled. Whether that update is schedule later, however, might always change things as China might be doing better by then. Given the recent update schedule I'd say the update for 2017 is possible but unlikely but for 2018 it is more likely (it would be odd to issue a statement basically saying \"we see no reason to review China before 2019\"). If I start with the likeliness for an update in 2017, I'd say the chances are about 20-50% I will take into account that S&P might change their mind and speed things up.\nFor 2018 the update is likely and currently it seems it COULD indeed bring a downgrade as well. I'll give this a 40%-70% chance\nNot before 1 January 2019 remains. I think here I'm effectively evaluating whether or not S&P had their scheduled meeting and decided not to downgrade the rating for China. I give that a 20% chance.
