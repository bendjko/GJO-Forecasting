The runoff elections will determine 68 seats in the 290-member Parliament. The reformist-moderate bloc made major gains during the first round of elections in February to the detriment of the hardliners. No single faction won an outright majority, however, so the runoff elections will be crucial in determining Parliament\u2019s final political makeup. Interior Ministry Spokesman Hossein Ali Amiri told reporters that election results will be announced on April 30, although he noted that this date could change. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif wrote an open letter to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in which he called upon the UN to intervene in a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling permitting terrorist attack victims to collect $2 billion in frozen Iranian assets. Zarif accused the U.S. of \u201cundermining the rule of law\u201d and stated that Iran holds the U.S. \u201cresponsible for this outrageous robbery, disguised under a court order, and is determined to take every lawful measure to restore the stolen property and the interest accrued to it.\u201d There seem to be different interpretation of tentative (unofficial results) by various news agencies.  Reuters has reported (in my opinion, a long record of accuracy in its data and reported information) the following results: Conservatives (First Round) : 112     ;  (Second Round) :  10  =  122\nModerates (First Round)  :  90      ;  (Second Round) :   36    =  126\nIndependents (First Round)  29  ;  (Second Round) :    20    =   49 Various combinations of outcomes are possible.  First, Conservatives win the four remaining seats, giving it a total of 126 (a tie with moderates).\nSecond, Conservative could loose 4 seats to Moderates, giving it a total of 130 (winning a majority over Conservatives).\nThird, both Conservative and Moderates could win 2 seats each, leading to a tie (neither party gains a majority).\nFourth, seats for Independents could determine a win for Moderates and a loss for Conservatives, or alternatively the other way around depending on their alignment. There are however still 4 seats that have not been reported and counting continues.  The current 3 seat (unofficial lead) by the Moderates should not be view as the official count, but it possible that it could meet the data for the official counts.   BBC has widely reported a major win for Moderates and conflates the voting bloc between it an Independents (although there is no formal alliance - Independents tend to vote for the regime, ie., the Supreme Leader and the Principlists).

No longer. This time they have not given up even when their first-round candidate was defeated, but rather have recruited from among the remaining candidates. This means a candidate who ran as an independent or even fundamentalist in the first round can end up on the \u2018Second List of Hope\u2019 running against a more radical fundamentalist. One Iranian activist puts it this way: after buses leave the terminals in Iran they stop for a second time at the edge of the city and offer discounted prices on any remaining seats. This is what the reform movement is doing. Having to go with a half-empty bus to the elections (because of disqualifications) it has acquired the habit of picking \u2018in-between\u2019 candidates, non-ideological moderates, or even \u2018rational\u2019 fundamentalists. This is a discounted ticket on the bus of reform. Prospects look good. The reformists calculate that the fundamentalists have already reached their maximum capacity of voters. They believe that fundamentalist voters were more likely than others to have responded to the calls to vote from supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has compared casting a ballot to a religious duty like daily prayers. The 38% of electors who did not show up to vote in February appeared indifferent to Khamenei\u2019s entreaties \u2013 and hence were either apolitical or politically-disposed boycotters. Reformers, then, could be right in thinking there are no more fundamentalists left to bring out for the second round. This leaves a decisive majority of potential second-round voters susceptible to the reformist call for incremental change along the lines President Hassan Rouhani has been pursuing since elected in 2013. The bus is leaving soon.\" And also, \nhttp://www.timesofisrael.com/irans-parliament-in-the-balance-in-election-run-off/\n\"Unlike the vote two months ago there has been little attention on Friday\u2019s election, which has been overshadowed by concern in Tehran that no benefits are being generated by the nuclear deal. The agreement between Iran and six powers \u2014 Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States plus Germany \u2014 became possible because supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei backed Rouhani\u2019s government.

Here is why: A.Fundamental hypothesis ( call it a bias if one likes) : Iran's desire & various signals to their partners both past & future is a Country in the midst of Change - objective being to compete on the geopolitical scene.  B. Conclusion: Considering the totality of recent events this year along w/ Iran's history, it remains extremely difficult to differentiate between the smoke and illusion of change ( Rouhani & reform moderate movement ) with the mirror of substantive facts that existing powers of status quo ( Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, the Islamic Recolutionary Guard &,  all powerful Guardian Council) remain still fundamentally in control. Procedurally, the moderate/reformist faction has made progress. Substantively, the following circumstantial evidence support the v high probability the Conservative/Hardline will continue to have an upper hand on matters of fundamental interest.  \nC.  Rationale for Conclusion: \n1. One the one hand, the recent sanctions relief were a first big piece of evidence to solving this question. The second,  the recent Iranian vote which provided further, at first blush,  impressive circumstantial evidence that, reform minded, moderate elements have gained momentum leaving the Q to be answered; \"will the conservatives maintain their majority\" in the upcoming referendum.  That is, procedurally, it looks to be all about the numbers. Substantively, however, it's  more definitional, who stands for what, and whether the majority remains \"conservative\". And, by who's definition ? The Western sources or Iranian sources. More importantly, however, it is argued here there are intangible factors noted below, along with the Guardian Council element,  that has clear capability to influence the outcome. Note below. 2. Both in terms of reliable & quotable source information that can be used to make a conclusive judgement, we have a dearth of information . @Khalid from my perspective provides one of the best short analysis of the problem http://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/179659 ; ditto NB: \nhttps://majlismonitor.com/en/2016/03/analysis-2016-iranian-parliamentary-assembly-of-experts-election-results/ wherein one reads \"...Even if hardliners eventually gain a majority in parliament following the runoffs, their leadership vacuum leaves their effectiveness as a bloc in question. Moreover the entry of the Hope List, made up of centrists, reformists, and traditional conservatives, into parliament is likely to make the legislature somewhat more politically diverse and, in the absence of the polarization of the past, maybe even more technocratic....\" Balanced against the number crunching bottom up work has been a persistent uncertainty, and the lack of reliable / quotable source non hearsay substantive information. Put as clearly as one can: OUTSIDE Western source interpretation of an INSIDE extremely  oblique voting process.  3. In addition, as above referenced, in the upcoming runoff where Conservatives have already taken a hit from the reform minded bloc, the  unfettered ability of the Guardian Council to vet candidates at will  becomes critically important at this stage of the election procedure.  Manipulation to achieve objectives?  As an example of this issue note, 24/3/16 Reformist Minoo Khaleghi newly elected to Parliament, was disqualified by the Guardian Council without reason. \nhttps://www.iranhumanrights.org/2016/03/minoo-khaleghi-disqualified/\n4. Moreover,  Aliv Safavi, granted he is member one of the main opposition coalition National Council of Resistance reiterates, the unelected Guardian Council's elaborate vetting process has barred many candidates from standing for election. http://www.ncr-iran.org/en/news/iran-world/20075-no-such-thing-as-reformers-in-iran-regime-ny-daily-news-op-ed\n5. Finally, more recently, an Iranian opposition leader Mehdi Karroubi, twice speaker of the Parliament, and now under house arrest asked President Rouhani to be put on trial \" to stand up against the idea of a regime w/ a single voice, made so through monopolizing and unaccountable power\".http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/04/15/world/middleeast/irans-president-is-squeezed-by-opposition-leaders-demand-for-a-trial.html?ref=topics&referer=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/mehdi_karroubi/index.html SUB CONCLUSION : Reference Guardian Council : we in the West do not have sufficient information to determine what limitations, if any, are imposed upon the Guardian Council. Which raises the Q of what influence, if any, can they exert in an apparently close call as this one will be to protect their clear vested interests?  6.

His assessment indicates that : \"Reformists did not \u201csweep\u201d the Iranian elections on February 26 for Parliament and the Assembly of Experts. Hardliners suffered humiliating losses in both bodies. Two of the Assembly\u2019s most notorious hardliners, including its current chairman, were defeated while hardliner parliamentarians lost every seat in Tehran to a moderate-reformist bloc formed days before the election. But the pro-Rouhani bloc will not win a majority in either body, and by no means will all members who ran on pro-Rouhani lists actually support the president\u2019s policies. Iranians voted for the reformist idea, but the vetting process prevented them from electing a reformist parliament. Preliminary results for Parliament indicate that the moderate-reformist bloc has won 83 seats; hardline Principlists have won 78; independents formally unaffiliated with any faction have won 60; and 64 seats will be filled in runoff elections scheduled for April. The elections\u2019 precise effect thus remains to be seen. Iran does not have political parties, and participation on an electoral list does not bind parliamentarians to vote in a certain way once elected.  The factional composition of the next parliament thus does not suggest that President Hassan Rouhani will have reliable support for all of his policies.

Key hard-liners, including two prominent clerics from the Assembly of Experts, were voted out.\nhttp://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/18177/iran-s-election-results-show-pendulum-swinging-away-from-hard-liners In an interview with Al-Monitor, Reformist political analyst Mohammad Javad Haghshenas said, \u201cI think the mass disqualification of candidates including popular figures like Ayatollah Khomeini made people upset.\u201d Nonetheless, it seems that Khomeini\u2019s failed candidacy turned out to be a win for him.

Meanwhile, though barred from running, his popularity has surged. His influence among the grand ayatollahs and politicians appears to have increased.

It would be most encouraging, heartwarming and validating  for me and others to see the Iranian \"conservatives\" defeated as a result of the success of \"moderate reformers\" like Rouhani and Rafsanjani.   On the surface, the early election returns shows that what were previous defined as the \"conservative slate\" likely fell slightly short of a majority.   The \"reform slate\" did better than expected given the elimination of very many \"reformers\" from the lists, but these slots  on the \"reformist slate\" were craftily filled by other candidates more acceptable to the Mullahs (including some \"conservatives\" now running as \"moderates\").  My earlier forecasts in the 90 to 100% range did not take that brilliant campaign move into account (I did not do enough research and thought many candidates from the reformist slate were eliminated rather than replaced) Since the definition of \"conservative\" and \"moderate\" is all pretty hazy in Iran anyway (when all are \"conservative\" by most any reasonable definition), I think it is is the slates (lists of candidates) that will take precedence over the individual political characterisation of each candidate.  The conservative slate likely fell just short of 50%,   GJP administrators are likely personally happy with that result, and (as in the National Football League) perhaps you need indisputable evidence to overturn a call on the field.

Analysts expect that even the second round will not bring a majority to any of the groups.\"\n** My take away: Hardliners could still keep the majority if they win all of the runoff elections. This seems unlikely given the strong showing my independents, moderates, and reformists, but its possible.  The Diplomat: http://thediplomat.com/2016/03/reformists-make-gains-in-iranian-elections-now-what/\n\u201cAccording to the latest results released by the normally reliable Iranian Student\u2019s News Agency, which are still unconfirmed, moderate reformists have won 83 seats in parliament, conservatives 78, and independents 60. Five seats go to religious minorities. The remaining seats will be distributed after a run-off for some cities and towns where candidates could not get the required minimum 25 percent of the votes. The run-off will be held in April.\u201d\n**My take away: By this count non-conservatives have won 148 (83+60+5) seats, so even if conservatives won all of the remaining seats they still wouldn't be able to secure a majority Albawba: http://www.albawaba.com/news/conservatives-still-pulling-strings-iran-despite-reformist-election-victory-812334\n\u201cFirst, here\u2019s what happened: In the first election, which was for the 290-seat Iranian parliament, reformist lawmakers snagged at least 85 seats at the time of writing. Meanwhile, moderate conservatives won an additional 73 seats. Their combined majority means that the two blocs will outnumber the hard-liners and conservatives who oppose the nuclear deal and Rouhani\u2019s plans to push for greater social freedoms.\u201d  ABC: http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-03/iranian-president-hassan-rouhani-ushers-new-consensual-politics/7219058\n\u201cWith most results now confirmed, the moderate reformist groups won about 80 seats, Principalists (conservatives) a further 80, and independent candidates have gained 60 seats.  With no fixed party affiliations, numbers are approximate and about 60 seats face run-off elections next month.\u201d \n** My calculations: By this calculation Principalists could maintain majority if they win all the run-off elections.  Economist: http://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21693937-boost-reform-long-way-still-go-mr-rohaniu2019s-complicated\n\u201cGiven the overlap between the lists, the results are not quite so clear-cut. On a rough assessment of the 216 seats that were decided (69 have been pushed to a run-off round in late spring and five are reserved for minorities), the conservatives won just under half, far worse than their tally at the previous election in 2012. The reformists got almost 40%, up from about 10%. So independents, including Mr Larijani, will hold the balance of power.\u201d\n** My take:  So this would suggest that conservatives could maintain majority if they win most of the run-offs Middle East Eye: http://www.middleeasteye.net/columns/decoding-iran-s-2016-elections-38335535\no\t\u201cStrangely enough, different sources have reported dissimilar mapping based on the candidates\u2019 affiliation. Those sources closer to the Principlists claim that the group has won the majority, while those closer to the moderates claim the opposite. However, after careful examination by this author, the most reliable conclusion is that 83 seats have gone to the moderates/reformists, 78 to the Principalists, 60 to the independents, and five to religious minorities. In any event, the totality of the assessments by these differing sources is indicative of the fact that, thus far, the weight of the two camps in Majlis is as near to political balance as one could expect. But a final assessment of which camp possesses greater power cannot be offered until the independents begin taking sides and the results of the second round are tabulated.\u201d\n** My take These numbers suggest Principalists can't get a majority since 148 of seats have already been decided, but the overall conclusion is its too soon to call.  Given the close race between the groups, I think its really unlike any group will have a majority after the run-offs, including the conservatives/principalists.

At a pc now, so y forecast, based principally on following: The current count I am basing off Tasnim, this is converted from persian but I did a manual count of the colours they have adopted:  http://www.tasnimnews.com/fa/news/1394/12/11/1014786/%D9%BE%DB%8C%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B2%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D8%B5%D9%88%D9%84%DA%AF%D8%B1%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%AC%D9%84%D8%B3-%D8%AF%D9%87%D9%85-%D8%A2%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%86%D8%AF-%D8%AA%D8%B3%D9%86%DB%8C%D9%85-%D8%A7%D8%B2-%D8%B3%D9%87%D9%85-%D8%A7%D8%B5%D9%88%D9%84%DA%AF%D8%B1%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D8%B5%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D8%B7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%AA%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%84-%DA%AF%D8%B1%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%88-%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%82%D9%84-%D9%87%D8%A7 This seems to tie into the 95-ish number though as Al-Monitor note, \"However, their list included Speaker Ali Larijani as a conservative. Larijani, while certainly within the traditional conservative camp, ran as an independent in the election and has been allied with the moderate Rouhani on many issues.\"  http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/03/iran-elections-interior-ministry-hijab-salahshouri.html.  Note this latter article offers some caution such as intent to dispute, moving to electronic ballots in the second ballot etc.  Also note the pragmatist title seems to be catching on as a way for Rouhini to transition ref: https://majlismonitor.com/en/2016/03/the-art-of-the-possible-a-victory-for-iranian-pragmatism/ I think the speaker will count as conservative from The majles monitor definitely deemed him a conservative prior to election, I posted this at the time but he was identified with \n\"The Conservatives\nAli Larijani, the Speaker of Majlis, has announced that he is forming a front within the conservative faction called \u2018The Followers of Velayat\u2019 (Leadership) in order to contest the parliamentary elections on behalf of the conservative movement. So far, this front has not yet been solidified. However, its formation is still likely even though most members of the conservative faction already share many of Larijani\u2019s views.\"  So thinking the count seems fair enough as Tasnim have it. So I am going with of the latest results from Tasnim, with 221 seats decided the conservatives have 97, with 69 seats to come in the second round.  I initially was wanting to hover around the 50ish mark where I ended up last time.  Conservatives need to get to the 146 seats for majority, so would need to convert 58ish of the 69.  I was thinking they would be better organised and my understanding of the TRS it should favour them conventionally.  I am thinking though that in the 97-ish some may revert back to independent, and as such the need to claim 60 oi 69 seems to be credible for now, but as I look into it the regions is where they can be seen more as independent than affiliated to a slate makes the challenge harder.

In that case though we may find they never declare officially whos who and as such it may become a void.  For scoring purposes if you believe that then not much point in coming down as if teh conservatives cannot claim it then it will not be announced?  At this point, I am simply trying to see from where we are on teh basis moderates are not conservative will the conservatives get enough to go over teh line.

It introduces a new category of \"pragmatists.\" The List of Hope which has somehow been labeled \"the\" reformist list (because that was the list that contained the reformists) actually also contains a \"majority of these folks are unknown quantities, and a few of them actually self-identify as conservatives.\" A truly \"unknown quantity\" who, at best, is a \"List of Hope Listee\" is very problematic. As I read this Atlantic article, it sounds to me that Sadjadpour is politely saying (between the lines): \"the categories you wish to use simply do not apply\" (on a reliable and consistent basis suitable for ideological identification). If this is true, I sincerely hope that GJ does not insist upon forcing them to apply. Edit: @000 - You're right. April run-offs extend the closing. I overlooked that. (There was no \"Reply\" selection available to me to respond to your comment inline with the thread.) Few doubt that the hard-line Principle-ists lost and that the \u2018Reformists\u2019 won a moral victory, but beyond that the precise balance of power is proving difficult to discern. Quite apart from joint lists and the fact that \u2018moderate\u2019 Principle-ists appeared to have made common cause with \u2018hard-line\u2019 reformists, this parliament witnessed the election of an unusually high number of independents with no apparent affiliation and to which each side has laid claim. Given the rigorous nature of the vetting, it is hard to see how they can be regarded as reformists. Time will tell which way they will fall. Then there are the approximately 20 per cent of seats that will be decided in the run-off, and many of these are seen as leaning towards the Principle-ists. The practical reality of this highly controlled election is of a parliament still dominated by Principle-ists of one hue or another with an overall institutional balance effectively engineered to the right of the political spectrum.\nhttps://rusi.org/commentary/political-spectacle-iranian-elections If you're looking for a shortcut, you can just assume that the WaPo (whose scheme we are following) has it all figured out:\n\"More conservatives won election overall\"\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/irans-elections-hope-but-no-change/2016/03/02/77ca21be-df30-11e5-846c-10191d1fc4ec_story.html\n(Although they themselves now use the scheme-busting term \"moderate conservatives.\")"], [10759, "2016-03-05T10:47:21Z", [1.0], ""], [4634, "2016-03-05T10:46:24Z", [1.0], ""], [12591, "2016-03-05T07:48:51Z", [0.55], ""], [306, "2016-03-05T07:27:35Z", [1.0], "I'm thinking more and more that this question will/should lead to a void.

The conservative camp is increasingly defined by orthodoxy, and this is harming the moderates\u2019 image among voters.\n\u2022\tThe moderates share some views with the Reformists, but do not like to be compared with the hard-liners, who are unpopular among the general public.  They  support the nuclear deal and the improved economic conditions to come following the lifting of sanctions.\n\u2022\tReformists will be led by a presidential candidate who stood aside in 2013 paving the way for Rouhani\u2019s victory.\n\u2022\tA middle ground list has emerged: the Voice of the Nation, led by a moderate conservative lawmaker known for his controversial positions including opposition to the ongoing house arrest of Mousavi and Karroubi.  \n\u2022\tThe exact numbers of candidates in the various camps is difficult to gauge, since they are spread out across hundreds of constituencies and many are relatively unknown politically. THE PROCESS\n\u2022\tIran does not follow a traditional political party system and instead relies on coalitions of candidates, with voting and campaigning usually centred on those lists rather than on individuals\n\u2022\tComplex election rules allow a candidate to be on more than one list, meaning they can draw support from across the political spectrum.\n\u2022\tcandidates who garner 25% of the vote are elected after the first round. THE LISTS\n\u2022\tThe conservative list of 30 candidates for Tehran astonished political observers because  only three were relative moderates, raising eyebrows and disagreements even among conservatives.  This may ultimately lead to an unprecedented defeat for the hard-liners. A parliamentarian said, \u201cMost top conservative candidates aren\u2019t pleased with the published list, and many of them aren\u2019t willing to withdraw in favor of the selected candidates, as they had previously promised.\u201d Moreover said another, \u201cThe current published list is not defensible. It would be better if some figures that had the ability to offer [their] reputation and [add] value to the list were on the ticket.\u201d \u201cThey don\u2019t have much of a chance, and only five of them \u2014 at most \u2014 will manage to gain enough votes to enter the next parliament.\u201d In sum, despite dominating the conservative ticket, it appears the hard-liners\u2019 chances of actually winning the elections are slim. This is particularly so because many moderate candidates, such as the prominent parliamentarian Ali Motahari and Larijani, are maneuvering to assemble their own rival lists or perhaps even join the Reformists\u2019 list.\n\u2022\tReformists, outnumbered otherwise, have formed an alliance with moderate parties close to Rouhani, after many years putting aside their differences to agree on a joint list of candidates in an unprecedented form of coalition aimed at blocking hardliners from entering the parliament.  They are led by an influential figure whose decision to stand down in the 2013 presidential election in favour of Rouhani was crucial to the later\u2019s victory. Also on the list is Ali Motahari, the parliament\u2019s sole current outspoken MP \u2013 a rare conservative figure who is also critical of the ruling establishment.    CURRENT SITUATION\n\u2022\tParliament is dominated by conservatives, partly because reformists mostly boycotted the last legislative elections four years ago.\n\u2022\tAt present, the moderates appear to have been defeated. It may seem odd to some, but the moderates are likely to be happy about that. Hard-liners have managed to seize control of the conservative camp, but their victory in the upcoming parliamentary elections is not guaranteed.\n\u2022\tReformists have largely shunned politics since after the disputed 2009 presidential election and the house arrest of two reformist leaders of the Green Movement.  Few contested the last parliamentary polls in 2012.\n\u2022\tAfter years of attempts to force moderates from the conservative leadership, the hard-liners seem to have succeeded. The moderates defeat, however, was voluntary and guided by moderate leaders, including Rafsanjani, Nategh-Nuri; and Larijani, the Speaker of parliament.\n\u2022\tThe nuclear deal has partly ended Iran\u2019s isolation but it has been followed by warnings from Khamenei that the military must guard against economic and cultural \u201cinfiltration\u201d by foreign actors who aim to damage the Islamic republic\u2019s revolutionary principles.\n\u2022\tthe major issue is the economy\n\u2022\tInTehran, over 1000 candidates are competing for just 30 seats. WHY THE CONSERVATIVES MAY RETAIN THEIR MAJORITY\n\u2022\ta day after the sanctions over its nuclear program were lifted, the US imposed new sanctions on 11 Iranian companies & individuals because of the ballistic missile program\n\u2022\treformists past non-participation in election\u2022\ta limited number of reformists were even able to get onto the ballot: originally only 30 out of 3k who applied, later increased to maybe 100 (there\u2019s 290 seats open)\n\u2022\t\u201cIn Tehran, only four reformist candidates are on the ballot where 30 will be elected \n\u2022\ttheocrats led by the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, control the army, the Guardian Council and comprise the real power base of the country.\n\u2022\ta shrewd political operator like Rouhani is unlikely to stake his agenda on achieving a more compliant parliament. For one thing, winning a majority in parliament brought not success but instigated a vicious backlash against Mr. Khatami and the reformists: In the weeks after their February 2000 electoral landslide, dozens of reformist newspapers were shuttered, many prominent dissidents and activists were arrested, and the movement\u2019s most brilliant political strategist was shot at point-blank range. While the reformist parliament could claim some modest legislative achievements\u2013such as an improved foreign investment law\u2013their real objective, political liberalization, was thwarted by hard-liner resistance. By the time their term ended in 2004, the reformists\u2019 popular mandate had waned. Mr. Rouhani is unlikely to repeat that mistake.\n\u2022\tAlthough parliamentarians backed Rouhani on the nuclear deal they did so less out of a sense of support for the president than because Khamenei made it clear he wanted sanctions lifted. WHY THE CONSERVATIVES MAY LOSE THEIR MAJORITY\n\u2022\tparliamentary elections have been scheduled to coincide with the Assembly elections, potentially boosting voter turnout which might boost reformist participation\n\u2022\tHassan Khomeini, the grandson of the Islamic Republic\u2019s founder, is running for the assembly. He could cause a massive groundswell of support and bring out voters, at the very least diminishing the prospects of a default conservative walkover.\n\u2022\thigh turn-out is expected\n\u2022\thardliners now fear that voters, hoping living standards can rise with sanctions out of the way, will reward pro-Rouhani candidates in the elections\n\u2022\tRouhani says there\u2019s 7-10m reformists  \n\u2022\tRouhani is seeking a mandate for domestic reforms\n\u2022\tAfter securing a nuclear deal with Western powers Rouhani can bank on widespread public support.

The reformists\u2019 patron is former president Mohammad Khatami, who faces restrictions on his movement and activities but is leading from behind the scenes. In Tehran, the reformists on Tuesday issued their joint list of 30 candidates they want to enter the Majlis from the capital. It is led by Mohammad Reza Aref, an influential reformist figure whose decision to stand down in the 2013 presidential election in favour of Rouhani was crucial in the moderate figure\u2019s victory. Also on the list is Ali Motahari, the parliament\u2019s sole current outspoken MP \u2013 a rare conservative figure who is also critical of the ruling establishment. Jalaeipour said the big challenge facing the reformers is persuading people to turn out and vote. \u201cThere have been a lot of disqualifications but they haven\u2019t purged all the reformists. The ultimate aim for moderates is to have fewer hardliners in the next parliament.\u201d  Although initial reports suggest that as few as 100 reformist candidates are among the 6,000 approved for the parliamentary elections by the Guardian Council, it is believed that some pro-reform figures may have been spared from disqualification because their allegiance has been unclear.\n[...]\nAccording to Souzanchi, there is little or no sign of an organised boycott of elections in Iran, in spite of the disqualifications. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like people think a boycott is a viable solution at the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen a lot of people boycotted under Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, hardliners easily dominated the Majlis, which affected everyone.\n[...]\nAccording to Hossein Bastani of BBC Persian, if fewer than half of those who voted for Rouhani in 2013 vote for a list of 16 moderate-leaning candidates in Tehran, the three main ultra-conservative leaders \u2013 Ahmad Jannati, Mohammad Yazdi and Mohammad Taghi Mesbah-Yazdi \u2013 will automatically be blocked.\n~~~ COMMENT: The \"data\" here aren't too promising, but I'm clinging to the fact that the conservatives only need to lose a handful of seats (http://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/128062)."], [19170, "2016-02-17T18:52:05Z", [0.6], ""], [961, "2016-02-17T17:29:38Z", [1.0], ""], [4491, "2016-02-17T16:47:26Z", [0.35], ""], [14327, "2016-02-17T16:12:14Z", [1.0], "\"none of the leading reformists or even their second tier candidates has been allowed to run.\" \"Iran\u2019s upcoming elections are simply another facet of the long-running struggle between the deep state, which wishes to keep its hold on the country through repression and economic domination, and the reformists, moderates and other democratic groups that are trying to move Iran on a path toward democracy. \"\nhttp://nationalinterest.org/feature/irans-elections-reformists-hardliners-the-%E2%80%98deep-state%E2%80%99-15212?page=2 Iran's leadership is simply too invested in the status quo to let go so easily.

Feb 10: \"The Upcoming Iranian Elections\" --> http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/02/the_upcoming_iranian_elections.html The upcoming elections in Iran bear no good news for the Iranian people, who have always sought political and social freedoms, or for claims of a \"new relationship\" between Iran and the West falsely ascribed to the recent nuclear deal intended to curb Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Before any votes are cast in the ballot boxes, diehard \u201cDeath-to-America\u201d chanting supporters of supreme leader Ali Khamenei \u2013 who has the final word on all important state matters \u2013 are showing there is no sign of change coming from within Iran. Even the so-called \"moderates\" backing President Hassan Rouhani have seen 99% of their candidates disqualified in the two important elections. Placed together, this clearly signals no shifts or \u201creforms\u201d from inside Iran can be expected from these polls, even after the \u201clandmark\u201d nuclear accord with the West and the expectations of ordinary Iranians rightfully raised. Due to the deceptive measures and fraud that characterizes the regime ruling Iran, the February 26 elections will most likely result in the hardliners winning a more powerful position. A manipulated elimination process in Iran grants enormous power to a small group of people who can decide nearly everything about who can run. Despite a factional political delusion and while the elections in Iran can hardly be described as anything similar to a Western-style democratic poll, a 290-member body called the \u201cMajlis\u201d (parliament) and 88-member Assembly of Experts are up for grabs. The latter is responsible for selecting a new \u201cvelayat-e faqih\u201d, or supreme religious leader, a post currently held by Ali Khamenei. He is now 76 years of age and reports indicate he is suffering from major illnesses, but will remain in his post as a virtual king until his death. Around 12,000 people from across Iran signed up to take part in the parliamentary election only to see more than 7,000 disqualified by the 12-member Guardian Council. This is a body with six candidates appointed directly by the supreme leader, with the six remaining chosen by the judiciary, known for its loyalty to Khamenei and leaving no doubt in the end results. Recently, nine political parties leaning towards the faction of Rouhani and Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a former president and heavyweight inside the Iranian regime political spectrum, complained about the disqualification of 2,700 so-called \u201cmoderate\u201d candidates for the parliament, with only 166 candidates being approved for the Assembly of Experts. Last week, reports indicated that even the grandson of Islamic Republic of Iran founder, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, could not prove his loyalty to the mullahs\u2019 ideology, as the hardliners continue to show they will not back down from their current position of control and intend to fight head on any possible move for change. Reports indicate Hassan Khomeini\u2019s credentials were rejected due to his close relationship with the Rafsanjani-Rouhani group. A large number of candidates were actually sent home due to their political viewpoints, Human Rights Watch reported, citing reviewed documents. Iran is far from being anything rightly defined as a democracy. Rouhani is a byproduct of this regime, without any ideas for real change. The Iranian people are truly yearning for an end to their country\u2019s long-running isolation. Out of no other choice and in a voice of protest against the hardline establishment a very small number supported Rouhani back in 2013. However, with sanctions being lifted, the Iranian nation now has high expectations on which Rouhani has failed to deliver, even involving his campaign promises to finally grant them their God-given rights, such as freedom of speech and the release of thousands of political prisoners and journalists who remain suffering in Iran\u2019s dungeons, according to various human rights bodies. Iran has the highest number of executions per capita in the world, not to forget the number of juveniles, according to a damning new Amnesty International report. The tight process of selecting candidates has launched a very vivid and dangerous dispute inside Iran. Khamenei himself has issued warnings against any relaxation of the anti-Western rhetoric this regime is notorious for. He strongly supported the vetting process and has already projected that his rivals will not enjoy any actual influence in the near future. Again, indications of any true change in Iran are hard to find. Despite the fact that candidates are allowed to demand an appeal for their disqualifications, any meaningful alteration in the results is hardly to be expected. Consider the controversial 2009 election, when Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was literally selected by Khamenei as the president and millions of people poured into the streets demanding their votes be respected, leaving the establishment no choice but to order a major and deadly crackdown. With no change in sight for the Iranian people, the result of the upcoming so-called elections in Iran will have unprecedented consequences for the ruling regime and the entire Middle East region. ~~~ COMMENT: So... if someone who's FOR regime change doesn't think that change is coming, it's hard to be too sure that regime change is coming."], [691, "2016-02-10T20:52:20Z", [1.0], ""], [368, "2016-02-10T19:07:02Z", [1.0], "Regarding the recent re-authorization of additional candidates for the February election (in both Parliament & the Assembly of experts, Iranian analysts doubt that there will be significant enough of a shift that would allow moderate/reformist candidates to gain a majority in parliament.  Given the two week & one week period for campaigning (Assembly & Parliament respectively), it is unclear how much will change.  While there is a popular perception among the electorate in Iran that gains achieved by the Nuclear deal by Reformists (which will primarily increase a popular vote for it in the election) are significant enough to not only increase electoral participation but also allow reformists/moderates to gain the majority it seeks.   Given this context, analysts suggest the following: \"The composition of Parliament may very well shift further in Rouhani\u2019s favor, but the extent to which his allies will be able to gain seats has already been significantly hampered by the Guardian Council. Similarly, the Assembly of Experts is shaping up to be comprised of members whose ideology is more aligned with Khamenei\u2019s than Rouhani\u2019s. Stay tuned.\" Looking at whether there is a resurgence among reformists in the parliamentary elections, the majority of analysts say - \"Not Quite!\"  Quote:  \"After reportedly disqualifying 99 percent of Reformist candidates in a previous round of vetting, the Guardian Council recently announced that it has reversed the disqualifications of 1,500 unnamed candidates. These additions raise the overall number of approved candidates so far to around 6,175 -- an underwhelming 50 percent of the original 12,123 registered candidates.\"  In an extensive assessment, specialists note the following from statements made by key reformists/moderate leaders :\n                 \"It is impossible to assess the precise number of Reformist candidates until the Guardian Council releases its final list of approved candidates on February 16, but Reformist reactions have been muted, possibly indicating that the Guardian Council\u2019s additional 1,500 candidates are not overwhelmingly Reformist and will not dramatically shift the balance of power in the elections away from hardliners. Mohammad Reza Aref, the former First Vice President under Reformist President Mohammad Khatami, bluntly told reporters that consultations with the Guardian Council were \u201cunsuccessful\u201d in overturning the disqualifications of key Reformist figures. Prominent Reformist newspaper Shargh, meanwhile, published an editorial claiming that the \u201csituation of the Reformist camp does not appear hopeful\u201d despite the overturned disqualifications. The most notable optimistic remark came from former Reformist president Mohammad Khatami, who said that \u201ca glimmer of hope remains\u201d that additional Reformist candidates have been confirmed.\" Looking forward beyond the elections, the University of Maryland has assessed the dynamics that are bound to dominate the political landscape if Reformists *were to* win a majority or not :  \"A resurgent Reformist party in Iran\u2019s new Parliament would not catalyze change in several of the most worrisome aspects of Iranian policy, however. A Parliament dominated by Rouhani supporters would be unlikely to constrain provocative Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps behavior in the Persian Gulf successfully. Support for Iranian military involvement in Syria also crosses party lines; a recent University of Maryland poll of Iranian public opinion found that a solid majority of 63 percent supports sending Iranian military personnel to Syria. An overwhelming 80 percent \u201capprove of the role\u201d Iran is currently playing in Syria.

Use your ****ING brains and try to give us clearer decision criteria next time you.... Ok, rant over. Right. According to much confusing press coverage, basically all non-Reformists are conservatives, thus implying a huge conservative majority in the Majles. This is in fact not true, as http://iran-times.com/independents-largest-bloc-elected/ - basically the only ****ING helpful piece I have found anywhere about the Majles - makes clear. The 88-seat \"independent bloc\" (in fact not really a bloc) is a just a large collection of non-ideological rural hicks elected on local issues with promises to bring back pork from Tehran. I'm sure they can be easily bought off by the dominant ideological faction, but this does not make them \"conservative\". This means that the actual conservative majority in the Majles is very thin (they have a large plurality, but that is NOT the same thing as a majority). 156 seats will be needed for a majority in 2016 (145 were needed in 2012), and it seems as though the Principlists currently have 182 seats https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_legislative_election,_2016 (though I can't find any good source for where Wikipedia is getting this number from, but if it's out, it's probably too high, but not by much, about 15 seats or so). At this point I am forced to throw my hands up and say that in my very strong opinion the correct definition of \"conservative\" in an Iranian context is \"Principlist\", and GJI would have been much better off using that terminology. If it turns out GJI disagree, well, **CK you. Right. Now, with the news of extremely high candidate applications and the news in the last few days of more relaxed Guardian Council vetting (http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/world/middleeast/iran-panel-reverses-disqualification-of-election-candidates.html) it does seem as though the Reformists will be able to slightly increase their number of seats. If I understand things correctly, Reformists & conservatives alike are fighting over the same urban seats to some considerable degree, and the rural areas are more likely to stick with their Independent local-issue candidates. Even if the Reformists manage to get up to about 35 seats, as that analyst in NYT suggests, (they currently have 13) that may well be enough to keep the Principlists from a majority, even though of course the Principlists will still have a large plurality.

Although a concrete definition of \"conservative\" is not provided, we include two important resources to frame the issue. First, the Washington Post article in the \"More Info\" section. It describes \"conservatives,\" both hardliners and traditionalists, as distinct from \"moderates\" which includes both reformists and centrists. Those \"moderates\" are not considered \"conservatives\" for the purposes of this question. This is why only the traditionalists and hardliners are mention in the \"More Info\" Section.  Second, we provided examples of media coverage from 2004 which distinguish between conservatives and reformists. We are hopeful that the the examples and the taxonomy developed by the Washington Post could ground the questions for forecasters.  As with all of our questions, we'll be using the totality of the media coverage to assess the answer.  Because it is such an important question and one likely to garner significant media attention we believe that this holistic approach will work.

Had American prisoners not been released and immediate sanctions been imposed on the ballistic missile program in Iran, one may correctly assume that this would be the case leading to a larger swing in the electorate's preferences for the Majles.   Iran's Supreme Leader has allowed its foreign policy to move into a more reformist realm (in the diplomatic realm) for purposes of gaining greater legitimacy and entry into the international system (attempts to normalize its relations with the world, which incidentally is a reality yet to be attained over time), access to international markets (oil and other generalized markets)  in order to improve domestic growth, needs for domestic consumption, modernization (ie., access to improved technology and not an opening of the social and political space in order to gain greater reform in society), an additional array of benefits from the nuclear deal with the West.   With new sanctions imposed on 11 entities regarding Iran's ballistic missile program, the Iranian perception has most likely solidified as too great cost given what it (Iran) regards as costs imposed by the nuclear deal.   While little analysis has been presented to the American electorate regarding this wise an ingenious diplomatic move, silences domestic and international critics of the benefits attained under the deal nuclear deal.  Additional diplomatic and substantive gains (benefits) were attained by the 1 time 'prisoner' exchange and the subsequent move to continue imposing the necessary costs on the Iranian theocracy. I suspect that while Rouhani has achieved some substantive gains (with respect to the domestic Iranian audience), much its domestic perceptions (regarding the upcoming elections) will be shaped the role of the Supreme Leader (a singular theocratic dictator) by the constrains and opportunities imposed on Rouhani.   It will be of significant interest to see how this plays out in Iran in the next few days and weeks.   Will these event embolden the hold of the conservatives in the Majles and Iranian society?

Then I began to see the term \u201cconservative realist\u201d used on some web sites. I have no idea who those people are. But it would make a big difference in the number of seats that \u201cconservatives\u201d currently hold, if they are counted. Will they be included in the count of \u201cconservatives\u201d?\" The reply from GJO: \n\"We could not provide a concrete definition of \"conservatives\" because  party and ideological identification in Iran is less structured than in the US and Europe. The question was framed this way to account for that fluidity, after consulting multiple Iran experts.  Although a concreted definition of \"conservative\" is not provided, we include two important resources to frame the issue. First, the Washington Post article in the \"More Info\" section. It describes \"conservatives,\" both hardliners and traditionalists, as distinct from \"moderates\" which includes both reformists and centrists. Those \"moderates\" are not considered \"conservatives\" for the purposes of this question. This is why only the traditionalists and hardliners are mention in the \"More Info\" Section.  Second, we provided examples of media coverage from 2004 which distinguish between conservative and reformists. We are hopeful that the the examples and the taxonomy developed by the Washington Post could ground the questions for forecasters.  As with all of our questions, we'll be using the totality of the media coverage to assess the answer.  Because it is such an important question and one likely to garner significant media attention we believe that this holistic approach will work.  A side note, the alternative was to not ask about the election. Since this will be one of the defining events for Iran, the middle east, and the nuclear deal, the team believed it was worth attempting even though the fluidity of Iran's system makes the question a bit more challenging. \" Trying to get these people's attention, as they were discussing this issue: @einsteinjs, @dkc, @dowser, @Khalid, @rjfmgy, @argon1, @morrell, @Jean-Pierre, @Amir- There are probably more."], [4273, "2016-01-17T03:14:26Z", [0.82], ""], [15196, "2016-01-16T23:30:33Z", [0.99], ""], [231, "2016-01-16T23:29:18Z", [0.4], ""], [43, "2016-01-16T20:55:27Z", [0.9], "Dateline 1-16-16 Hanif Zarrabi-K. \u200f@hanifzk  4m4 minutes ago\nHead of Iran's election office:\n12,046 candidate files sent to prosecutor\n763 have conviction history\n810 have been DQ'd\n498 have withdrawn"], [368, "2016-01-16T19:09:31Z", [0.95], ""], [601, "2016-01-16T15:04:34Z", [0.93], ""], [12118, "2016-01-16T14:29:06Z", [0.79], ""], [691, "2016-01-16T12:54:42Z", [0.98], ""], [98, "2016-01-16T03:21:17Z", [0.95], ""], [9842, "2016-01-16T00:38:46Z", [0.75], ""], [368, "2016-01-15T20:36:22Z", [0.45], ""], [368, "2016-01-15T20:32:58Z", [1.0], ""], [2380, "2016-01-15T20:06:09Z", [0.67], ""], [1738, "2016-01-15T17:18:39Z", [0.78], ""], [3363, "2016-01-15T13:41:01Z", [0.66], ""], [43, "2016-01-15T13:36:59Z", [0.9], ""], [4577, "2016-01-15T13:17:39Z", [0.8], ""], [15477, "2016-01-15T12:51:08Z", [0.91], "With the lifting of sanctions, Iran is approaching nuclear weapon attainment (despite their assertions to the contrary.)

Although the Guardian Council is unlikely to approve all candidacies,...\n...surge in the number of registered candidates can be traced to five main motivating factors....Moreover, since the norm of having political parties does not exist in Iran, some only put forth candidacies because they like the idea of going to the Ministry of Interior to register and getting the related media attention. In addition, considering the rate of unemployment and economic decline in Iran, certain educated but jobless individuals believe that becoming a member of parliament is an opportunity to gain access to better economic and political opportunities....Second is the Reformists\u2019 strategy. Supporters of the Rouhani administration, including Reformists, have adopted the strategy of introducing a lot of candidates in the hopes that if their leading figures are disqualified, lesser-known Reformists will be given the chance to run for parliament and pursue the Reformist agenda. This strategy is useful for mobilizing people in order to change the political makeup of parliament and the Assembly of Experts, both of which are currently dominated by non-Reformists. Prominent Reformists can of course wield more influence and be more effective compared to second- or third-rate colleagues. However, the Reformists are not going to give up easily. They are hoping to at least increase the political cost for the conservatives if the Guardian Council engages in mass disqualifications of registered candidates....Third is the most important political turning point of Iran in the next 10 years. There is speculation that in the next decade, considering the age of Iran\u2019s 76-year-old, ailing Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the country will have a new leader. Considering the authority enjoyed by the supreme leader within Iran\u2019s political system, various groups are looking to secure their positions in the Assembly of Experts, which is tasked with selecting the next supreme leader. Rafsanjani\u2019s proposal to establish a \u201cleadership council\u201d instead of a single supreme leader has been criticized by the conservatives but welcomed by the Reformists and alternative political thinkers. On the other hand, if Reformists and supporters of the Rouhani administration manage to win a majority of seats in parliament, sidelined Reformists can return to politics, and thus the atmosphere of moderation and reform long promised by Rouhani can finally be institutionalized....Fourth is women\u2019s rights campaigns....Last but certainly not least is that the outcome of the latest presidential elections continues to impact Iranian politics. The 2013 presidential vote proved that by participating in elections and supporting a certain candidate, people can overcome some of their economic and political problems. Indeed, Iranians realized that by taking part in polls and electing Rouhani, they could help solve the nuclear crisis, which had been ongoing since 2003. It should not be overlooked that a majority of people believe that they can influence the politics of their country by casting their ballots. \n"], [4273, "2016-01-08T00:12:41Z", [0.89], ""], [3363, "2016-01-07T22:29:08Z", [0.61], ""], [12789, "2016-01-07T21:54:04Z", [0.9], "An upsurge in naked aggression between Saudis and Shias will force Iran into a more hardline stance as they fight Wahabbist Sunni ISIL forces (who, among other support, are thoroughly backed covertly by private Saudi wealth)."], [9755, "2016-01-07T21:37:19Z", [0.89], "the force is with the dark side , let's hope  we are wrong.

Mr Rafsanjani, who is a member of the AoE and has conducted an aggressive re-election campaign, has publicly thrown in his lot with the reformists after being deselected in several key previous elections by conservative groups.\nIt appears that the meaning of \"conservative\" may even be up for redefinition in this election, as those previously defined as conservatives are increasingly viewed as moderates, leaving only a husk of diehard zealots sustained by institutional support from the judiciary, the security services and the IRIB (Iran's state broadcaster).\n"], [12676, "2016-01-07T14:12:31Z", [0.71], "http://www.criticalthreats.org/iran-news-round-january-5-2016 Khomeini grandson did not take exam for Assembly of Experts elections (probably was disqualified).  +3"], [1751, "2016-01-07T07:01:41Z", [0.96], ""], [53, "2016-01-07T06:04:31Z", [0.85], ""], [12856, "2016-01-07T02:16:56Z", [0.75], ""], [2895, "2016-01-07T00:49:42Z", [0.9], "Update - escalation of conflicts with Saudi ed Sunni Arab factions push more polarization to conservative stance of electorate"], [93, "2016-01-07T00:16:22Z", [1.0], ""], [14258, "2016-01-07T00:08:42Z", [0.9], ""], [14774, "2016-01-06T22:05:58Z", [0.85], ""], [9613, "2016-01-06T19:50:06Z", [0.95], ""], [12118, "2016-01-06T19:40:56Z", [0.93], ""], [14613, "2016-01-06T19:21:34Z", [0.81], ""], [368, "2016-01-06T18:29:21Z", [0.95], ""], [14166, "2016-01-06T17:46:16Z", [0.9], ""], [691, "2016-01-06T14:19:46Z", [0.97], ""], [601, "2016-01-06T09:33:30Z", [0.91], ""], [12302, "2016-01-06T09:25:08Z", [0.99], ""], [11788, "2016-01-06T04:33:11Z", [1.0], ""], [11080, "2016-01-06T04:29:46Z", [0.92], ""], [11080, "2016-01-06T04:29:19Z", [0.9], ""], [5863, "2016-01-06T01:28:56Z", [0.6], ""], [5545, "2016-01-06T00:09:19Z", [0.89], ""], [14369, "2016-01-05T23:40:08Z", [0.68], ""], [12029, "2016-01-05T20:44:24Z", [0.65], ""], [4289, "2016-01-05T20:16:43Z", [0.92], "Thanks for your comment and the new info @madre!

The United Arab Emirates also downgraded relations.\nAt first glance, it may appear that Islamic vigilantes had created a diplomatic crisis that fuelled tensions between the two regional superpowers.\nBut reform-minded analysts warned that Iran\u2019s hardliners have exploited public outrage to undermine President Hassan Rouhani and his allies.\n\u201cWithout doubt, the incident is related to the current tense political infighting,\u201d said one analyst. \u201cMore bad news will come soon. There will be a further build-up of pressure on the reformists.\u201d\nIran struck a landmark nuclear agreement with big powers last summer, which is expected to be implemented this month. The benefits of that accord \u2014 following the lifting of economic sanctions \u2014 should increase Mr Rouhani\u2019s leverage in Iran\u2019s sophisticated corridors of power.\nHardliners, who were shocked to lose to Mr Rouhani in the 2013 presidential election, hope to win back support in crucial polls next month after a series of setbacks, that included the nuclear deal.\n\u201cIt is hard to believe that some people threw Molotov cocktails at the Saudi embassy and confiscated it for one or two hours without being supported by some [power] centres,\u201d said Mohammad-Sadegh Javadi-Hesar, a reformist politician. \u201cThat\u2019s why they easily take selfies and seem confident they will be rewarded for their radical stances.\u201d\nIran\u2019s hardliners are mostly based in the elite Revolutionary Guard, the judiciary, parliament, state-run television and the Guardian Council, a constitutional watchdog that vets candidates\u2019 Islamic (and political) credentials. The council is expected to bar many reformist candidates from running for the polls by questioning their allegiance to the Islamic ideology.\nAfter nearly a decade of isolation Iran has a deal with six world powers to wind back progress towards building a nuclear bomb in exchange for a reversal of international economic sanctions\nEven the grandson of the founder of the Islamic revolution, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, may not pass the tough vetting procedure. Hassan Khomeini \u2014 who is allied with reformists and whose candidacy has outraged hardliners \u2014 is obliged to take a test on Tuesday to certify he is a suitably senior cleric to enter into the Experts Assembly, which could decide on who should be Iran\u2019s next supreme leader.\nEven so, reformist analysts say that while senior political leaders may approve a crackdown on reformists, they doubt they would have given the green light to storm an embassy. The international repercussions for such a drastic move would be too severe for the country.\nEven a hardline cleric such as Ahmad Khatami, who leads Tehran\u2019s Friday prayers, condemned the attack on the embassy.\nMr Khatami said that \u201cwe don\u2019t achieve anything by attacking embassies and setting fire to them\u201d and that \u201cit was not appropriate to attack the Saudi embassy and consulate \u201d.\nIf the attack leads to the barring of Iranians travelling to the Hajj pilgrimage in Mecca, it would prove particularly embarrassing for the country\u2019s senior leaders.\nIran\u2019s supreme leader and ultimate decision maker, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, had warned after a similar attack on the British embassy in Tehran in 2011 that diplomatic missions should enjoy complete security.\nHardliners might be staunch supporters of Iran\u2019s supreme leader, but analysts say that they cannot resist the opportunity to weaken their rivals.\nAyatollah Khamenei cannot afford to allow severe prosecution of those embassy demonstrators as they have come to the Islamic Republic\u2019s aid before and carried out brutal crackdowns on opposition movements.\n\u201cHardliners need to radicalise the political and social atmosphere so they can eliminate their rivals under the pretext of national security,\u201d Mr Javadi-Hesar added.\n\u201cTheir number in various centres may be equal to a few brigades who can be quickly organised to confront people with moderate groups who are now identified with Mr Rouhani.\u201d"], [9401, "2016-01-05T06:00:52Z", [0.75], ""], [14327, "2016-01-05T04:55:02Z", [0.9], "http://www.globalpost.com/article/6714404/2016/01/04/khamenei-says-us-faces-punch-mouth-iran-polls These threats of mouth-punching seem like a virtual guarantee that many moderates and reformers will be excluded from the vote - both as candidates and as electors.

The incumbent, controversial hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, was announced the victor. The Reformist candidates, Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi, challenged the results and encouraged their supporters to hold street protests \u2014 the largest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Despite hundreds of arrests, dozens of deaths and the house arrest of the so-called Green Movement leaders, Iranian officials responsible for the crackdown continue to raise the issue of the 2009 elections as a sort of dividing line between those who should be allowed to be part of the political process and those who should not. The Guardian Council spokesman was not the only official to discuss the 2009 elections recently.

While a number of the Reformists had their political careers come to an end over the 2009 elections, politicians who stayed on the fence or were perceived to have supported the Green Movement behind the scenes are most at risk of being disqualified in these current elections. Ayatollah Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a candidate in the Assembly of Experts elections, is perhaps the most well-known political figure who is attacked by conservative media for not drawing a clear line with those who contested the elections. While Rouhani will hope that moderates make a strong showing to break the grip of conservatives over this parliament, given the high number of candidate registrations, there will certainly be a high number of disqualifications. Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, the head of the Guardian Council, said during Friday prayers Dec. 25 that the high numbers of candidates to register are \u201cunfortunate\u201d and \u201cmysterious.\"\nhttp://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/12/iran-elections-parliament-2009-green-movement.html?utm_source=Al-Monitor+Newsletter+%5BEnglish%5D&utm_campaign=a315908cf7-December_30_2015&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_28264b27a0-a315908cf7-102297633 What I look for is indications of just how legit the authorities want to seem - this is where I think we will find reformists elected.

All candidates for the Majles must be approved by Iran's Guardian Council, which is dominated by conservatives appointed by the Ayatollah and the head of the judiciary (who is also appointed by the Ayatollah). Iran's Guardian Council also has a history of disqualifying reformist candidates:  - In 2004, the \"Guardian Council\u2019s wholesale disqualification of reformist candidates, including sitting reformist lawmakers of the sixth parliament, set the stage for the return of conservatives to power in the seventh parliament\" (Iran Primer). All told, the Guardian Council disqualified over 4,000 reformist hopefuls in 2004, including 80 sitting members. - In 2008, the Guardian Council continued its  \"aggressive vetting of reformist candidates\" (Iran Primer). The Council disqualified around 2000 candidates in 2008.   - In 2012, the election was influenced by \"continued aggressive vetting and several key reformist parties\u2019 decision not to participate\" (Iran Primer). There were also widespread allegations of vote rigging and fraud.  Updating Strategy: A key election signal will be the number and type of candidates disqualified by the Guardian Council. If a significant number of reformist candidates are not allowed to run, it becomes increasingly likely that the conservatives will maintain their hold on the Majles. It will also be worth watching the number of reformist politicians that choose to register in the first place. Quite a few leading reformists decided not to participate in 2012. Candidate registration began on December 19 and will run until December 26. We should know how many are approved sometime shortly after that.
