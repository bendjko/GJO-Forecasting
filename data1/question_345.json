Chief government negotiator Humberto de la Calle said the new pact to end 52 years of war with the Marxist FARC group was the best and most complete agreement the two sides could achieve, and it will not be adapted again. \"This is the final accord; it's the definitive accord,\" he told reporters in Bogota. \"There's really no room for more negotiation.\" A decision on how the new accord will be approved will come after meetings with legislators, which are expected soon, Interior Minister Juan Fernando Cristo said. The law does not require President Juan Manuel Santos to hold a new referendum, so he could try to ratify it through Congress. The expanded and highly technical 310-page document appears to make small modifications to the original text, such as clarifying private property rights and detailing more fully how the rebels would be confined in rural areas for crimes committed during the war. Some in the opposition, who had asked to study the draft before it becomes final, have criticized it as just a tweaked version of the original.\nBut the government said it studied 500 or so proposals from the opposition, religious leaders and others to end a conflict that has killed more than 220,000 and displaced millions.

Santos immediately began looking for ways to rescue the deal and the sides extended a cease-fire until Dec. 31 to get the modified deal done. The rebels insisted they wouldn't go back to the drawing board and throw out years of arduous negotiations with the government. Second: interim agreements on specific topics were apart of this new amended deal. Yet they were also a part of the first peace deal. Nevertheless, the question just states that a new deal be signed on terms. Ratification is not required.  There seems to exists a small waiting period for the opposition leaders to read it over but it seems unlikely they would return to a state of war over a few small issues not meeting their wishes at this time.  Regan (2016) November 13, states that: The government of Colombia and the rebel group known as FARC forged an amended peace deal on Saturday, more than a month after voters narrowly rebuffed an initial accord that would have ended a half-century of war.\nThe renewed effort between Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and government officials took place in Havana, where peace talks have been ongoing between the two sides for four years (para 1-2).\n\u201cWe call upon all Colombia and the international community to back this new accord and its quick implementation so as to leave the tragedy of war in the past,\u201d Santos and FARC leaders said in a statement. \u201cPeace cannot wait anymore\u201d (para 5). Regan, M., D. (2016). Colombia and FARC sign amended peace deal. PBS News Hour. World. Retrieved from\nhttp://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/columbia-farc-amend-peace-deal/\nThe Economist (2016) states that: Will a second attempt fare better than the first? Deal or no deal? WHEN Colombia\u2019s government reached an agreement in August to end its 52-year war with the FARC guerrilla army, it claimed the deal was the \u201cbest accord possible\u201d. After Colombian voters rejected it in a plebiscite on October 2nd the government and the FARC went back to the negotiating table. On November 12th Colombia\u2019s president, Juan Manuel Santos, presented the revised accord that resulted from the talks. It is, he claimed in a televised address, even better.\nIt is not clear yet how Mr. Santos, who was awarded the Nobel peace prize last month, will secure ratification of the new agreement. He might risk another referendum or simply send it to Congress, where he commands a majority. \u00c1lvaro Uribe, a former president who led the campaign against the first version of the agreement, said he wants to study the revised accord before rendering a judgment.\nhe changes are considerable. After weeks of meetings between the Colombian government and domestic critics of the deal, including Mr. Uribe, the government presented 500 proposed modifications to FARC representatives in Havana, where the peace negotiations have been taking place. Chastened by the referendum result, the FARC accepted most of them, crossing its earlier red lines. \u201cWe understood the importance of reformulating [the agreement] with a broader consensus that incorporates many voices that were absent during the negotiating process,\u201d said Iv\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez, the FARC\u2019s lead negotiator.\nUnder the new agreement, the FARC have committed themselves to declaring and handing over all their assets, which will be used to pay reparations to victims of the conflict. Just how much the guerrillas have stashed away or invested from decades of drug-dealing, illegal mining and extortion is uncertain. If they fail to surrender their loot, they will lose the benefits laid out in the \u201ctransitional-justice\u201d provisions of the peace agreement.\nThese, too, have been revised. The biggest objection to the original agreement was that it treated too leniently guerrilla leaders who had committed war crimes. As in the original agreement, guerrillas (and members of state security forces) who confess to crimes before a special tribunal will continue to avoid jail. But the new agreement reduces the discretion the tribunal will have to interpret the \u201crestricted liberty\u201d to which they will then be subject. They will now serve their sentences in areas no bigger than the demobilization zones in which guerrillas will be concentrated once the deal takes effect (para 1-6).\nThe revised deal also stretches out the period of implementation from ten to 15 years to make it easier to pay for the investment it requires in social programs and infrastructure. A congressional committee has estimated that such investment will cost $31bn. In another concession to foes of the original agreement, the revised accord will not form part of the constitution, as the FARC had wanted to safeguard it from revision. Opposition politicians feared that incorporating the deal into the constitution would undermine Colombia\u2019s democratic institutions (para 9).\nIn all, the changes affect 56 of the 57 points that opponents of the agreement had criticized. The exception is the eligibility of FARC members to run for public office once they demobilize and disarm. The FARC are guaranteed five seats in each of the two chambers of the legislature in the next two elections. Mr Santos defended those rights in his televised speech. \u201cThe reason for all peace processes in the world is precisely so that guerrillas leave their arms and can participate in politics legally,\u201d he said (para 9-10).

The FARC will still be allowed to form a legal political party and run for Congress, he said. Santos didn\u2019t say whether the deal will be put to a second plebiscite.\nThe deal aims to address some of the objections of opponents of the original agreement. The government has held weeks of talks with leaders of the \u201cno\u201d campaign, including former President Alvaro Uribe, who attacked the agreement as too lenient on a group that kidnapped and murdered Colombians.\n\u201cWe hope this work satisfies those from the \u2018no\u2019 campaign and the nation,\u201d Santos said. \u201cWe hope peace allows us to unite as a nation, and seize with both hands the opportunities that tranquility, security and unity bring.\u201d\nThe agreement clarifies the conditions under which FARC leaders would be deprived of their liberty, the government\u2019s chief negotiator Humberto de la Calle said in Havana, where the peace talks took place. The pact also makes clear its respect for the right to private property, and will be fiscally sustainable, he said (para 1-5). Jaramillo, A & Medina, O. (2016).

Similarly, the pressure from the international community in favor of the accords would strengthen. This would lead Santos to appeal to the Colombian National Congress and to implement the current peace accords via Congress. In spite of the peace agreement failing, it failed by a tiny margin.
