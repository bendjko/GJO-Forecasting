Talk of a major upgrade to the LEAF for 2017 makes it even more improbable that sales will improve at the end of 2016. Last year, LEAF sales between July and December accounted for a little less than 7500 sales; the LEAF's performance this year has been down on 2015 consistently; even if it improves, matching 2015's performance in the second half of the year, sales would still not reach 15000.
