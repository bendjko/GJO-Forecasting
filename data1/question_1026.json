The Supreme court has granted more \"pauper\" cases than I can ever recall seeing 5-6 in the last granting, usual is what 1-2? I like the idea of the supreme court going back to civilian roots - it argues against federal overreach.  Going back to this quesiton particularly.   The constitution is pretty explicit.  You shall not try a defendant twice for the same crime. \nAround 150 years ago, out of whole cloth, they invented the separate sovereigns exception.  However, the separate sovereigns was only binding on the federal government until 1969.  Early courts, and English common law absolutely prevented double prosecution - and the modern ruling has undergone challenge after challenge.  The issue here is that we are trammeling the right of finality.  The argument against double jeopardy is a right and defense for the individual against the government.  Four justices were needed to grant certiori - 5 are needed to prevail.  Interestingly,  Ginzburg and Thomas were in favor of granting a similar cert in 2013, and again in 2016. \n  And the ACLU has long been against this double jeopardy.  This could see an alignment between the ultra liberal and the textualist (originalist judges).  Something like Ginzberg, Thomas, Alito Kavanaugh.  Blueford v Arkansas  Kagan, Sotomayer,  & Ginzburg argued that double jeopardy applied.  Strange bedfellows indeed - usually the liberal wing advances the powers of federalism.  But in this case, it sure looks as if the liberal wing prevails picking up at least some of the textualists, being able to get a 6:3. Arguments against - there would be huge rafts of cases where the defendants would be let go, and perhaps sue for damages. \n  The court may shy away for this reason.  The court may wish to explore midway positions; trying to refine or correct the two sovereign doctrine.   Enumerating a standard seems very difficult to me.  OTOH:  This Court has not hesitated to restore constitutional protections that have narrowed beyond the Framers\u2019 intent.  See, e.g., Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 60 (2004) (overturning a Confrontation Clause precedent that \u201cdepart[ed] from [its] historical principles\u201d).  In such cases, the Court has stressed the importance of \u201cprovid[ing] at a minimum the degree of protection [the Constitution] afforded when it was adopted.\u201d  Jones, 132 S.
