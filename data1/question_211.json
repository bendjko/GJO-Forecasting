Then there is a broader interpretation that any significant deaths that are not combat related or otherwise proscribed would count (in the sense that those targeted are \u201coutsiders\u201d in some sense).

Gov't take over of media outlets - seems to be a campaign of violence against Kurdish parts of the country - starts with declaration of curfew, followed by army moving in, bombing/destruction of homes and businesses, citizens not allowed access to medical care,  gov't says PKK but civilian deaths certainly too (children, pregnant women), followed by gov't bulldozing buildings and appropriating land.
