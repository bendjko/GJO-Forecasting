But this impact is not fatal,\u201d he said.  \u201cWe have started to forget that food price inflation in early 2008 was 13 percent, you can look it up.

That changes the way you look at the question. Last years 4th quarters: Brazil +.3   (Brazil in recession. Dont think they will make it)\nRussia +.4  (bordering on recession, if not in it.--not sure they can reach this number 4th quarter)\nIndia +7.5%  (????)\nChina +7.3% (have already downgraded to 6.8% for the 4th qtrI believe)"], [12006, "2015-12-08T20:07:37Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.85, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [52, "2015-12-08T19:53:39Z", [0.5, 0.3, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0], "1"], [128, "2015-12-08T19:51:30Z", [0.0, 0.04, 0.62, 0.3, 0.04], "China positive.\nIndia positive.\nRussia negative.\nBrazil negative.
