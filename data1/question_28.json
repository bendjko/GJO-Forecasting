There are multiple ways to do so.\"   So, my guess is that the methods specified in the executive agreement mentioned in the article will (a) resolve this issue to the IAEA's satisfaction, and (b) remain confidential, at least officially. That would result in the IAEA issuing a statement that the inspections were done, it is satisfied by the methods used for the inspections, and it is confident in the results from those inspections. I think under those circumstances, the criteria for a \"Yes\" on this question will be met. So here are my predictions: 1. The IAEA and Iran will successfully negotiate an executive agreement that spells out how inspections are to place with regard to the Parchin facility. \n2. The agreement will remain officially confidential. \n3.  The agreement will involve (somehow) Iranian personnel working with the IAEA to conduct the inspections. Most likely the people sticking shovels in the ground and bagging the dirt will be Iranian. Beyond that it's hard to say.\n4. The IAEA will report that inspections shave been carried out under the parameters of the executive agreement and that it those parameters meet its requirements for whatever verification needs are spelled out in the broader deal. \n5. This will all occur fairly quickly, most likely before the end of the year.  So I'm going to 80% under the assumption that the above circumstances will qualify for a yes.
