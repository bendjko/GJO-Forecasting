I think they have found something to narrowly focus on that will let them sent it back with comments. Starting to drop the slider. In Minnesota Voters Alliance v. Mansky, the Supreme Court reversed the Eighth Circuit, ruling that Minnesota statute prohibiting clothing with political speech at polling places violated the First Amendment. In this case, the Minnesota Voters Alliance and several other groups and individuals, including the Minnesota Northstar Tea Party Patriots and the Election Integrity Watch (collectively referred to by the court as Minnesota Voters Alliance or MVA), filed suit against the Minnesota Secretary of State and other elections officials in Minnesota. The plaintiffs claimed that Minnesota Statute \u00a7 211B.11 violated their rights under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. They alleged that the statute chilled their free speech rights because it prohibited them from wearing apparel with Tea Party logos to their polling places. On a vote of 7 - 2, the Supreme Court reversed the Eighth Circuit, ruling that the Minnesota statute violated the First Amendment. Chief Justice John Roberts authored the majority opinion, joined by Justices Anthony Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Elena Kagan, and Neil Gorsuch. Roberts ruled, \"Minnesota\u2019s ban on wearing any 'political badge, political button, or other political insignia' plainly restricts a form of expression within the protection of the First Amendment.\" However, he continued, because the ban applied only to polling places, the statute \"implicates our 'forum based\u2019 approach for assessing restrictions that the government seeks to place on the use of its property.\u201d He wrote that polling places are nonpublic forums in which the government has some freedom to restrict free speech rights. Therefore, as an initial matter, \"in light of the special purpose of the polling place itself, Minnesota may choose to prohibit certain apparel there because of the message it conveys, so that voters may focus on the important decisions immediately at hand.\" But the prohibition, he concluded, must be clearer than the statute in this case in order to pass First Amendment muster: \"If a State wishes to set its polling places apart as areas free of partisan discord, it must employ a more discernible approach than the one Minnesota has offered here.\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented from the majority's judgment, joined by Justice Stephen Breyer. Sotomayor argued that, because the case concerned a state law, the Supreme Court should have allowed Minnesota state courts to rule on the constitutionality of the statute first. She wrote, \"Especially where there are undisputed many constitutional applications of a state law that further weighty state interests, the Court should be wary of invalidating a law without giving the State\u2019s highest court an opportunity to pass upon it.\"  She concluded, \"Because the Court declines to take the obvious step of certification in this case, I respectfully dissent.\""], [59008, "2018-06-13T05:42:55Z", [0.9], "Content based speech gets heightened treatment, incredibly vague laws have to give fair notice of what is barred. .Even assuming this law has a legitimate basis, fear of intimidation, the law will fail as a it isn\u2019t narrowly tailored, or is so vague that the voter has no way to know what mind offend people, as if offending speech didn\u2019t have any protection.

A Sticky Wicket indeed.  This was a case about the scope of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution in the context of polling places.[1] Generally, the right to free speech ensures the right to express political beliefs, including by wearing clothing with political slogans, badges, or insignia. However, under earlier United States Supreme Court cases, states may prohibit some measure of political expression inside polling places when voting is underway. The issue in this case how far a state can constitutionally go in prohibiting political expression in polling places. Specifically, the issue is whether a state can ban not only outright political endorsements of a candidate but also political expression that does not make reference to a candidate or issue on the ballot that day. The Minnesota statute at issue is Statute \u00a7 211B.11. Minnesota Statute \u00a7 211B.11 \"prohibits wearing a 'political badge, political button, or other political insignia . . . at or about the polling place on primary or election day.\u201d[1][2] The statute \"broadly prohibits any material 'designed to influence and impact voting,' or 'promoting a group with recognizable political views,' even when the apparel makes no reference to any issue or candidate on the ballot.\"[3] Under the statute, a person who wore political apparel to a polling place was still allowed to vote. However, if the person refused to cover or remove the item, an election judge was to \"record the person's name and address for potential misdemeanor prosecution.\"[1] The issue is whether the prohibition of all political apparel violates the right to free speech under the First Amendment.[1]\nhttps://ballotpedia.org/Minnesota_Voters_Alliance_v._Mansky"], [53582, "2018-03-15T21:02:07Z", [0.35], "I except something more narrow in scope than declaring the ban as facially unconstitutional."], [56093, "2018-03-15T00:23:30Z", [0.65], ""], [691, "2018-03-14T13:02:11Z", [0.12], ""], [56206, "2018-03-13T21:34:22Z", [0.95], ""], [36942, "2018-03-13T15:51:29Z", [0.45], ""], [7370, "2018-03-12T19:44:45Z", [0.1], ""], [48624, "2018-03-12T18:36:02Z", [0.8], ""], [52905, "2018-03-12T18:25:11Z", [0.6], ""], [53555, "2018-03-12T17:07:27Z", [0.85], ""], [54307, "2018-03-11T18:31:54Z", [0.35], "I found this tough.

As another participant noted, questions did not seem to follow usual left /right splits.  People have an explicit right to free speech, unless there is a compelling public interest, and that compelling public interest is framed as narrowly as possible. States have a explicit right to set voting standards.  They have a compelling interest in maintaining a voting site free of intimidation.  Minnesota's ban is more explicit that almost all states; and as a general rule elections run fine in other states.  Arguing in favor of facial overturn\n1.  The statute is subjective.  \n2.  It is impossible to state what would and would not be banned.   First Amendment T-shirts would not be; 2nd Amendment would be.    What about #I Miss Bill.   #Dreamer  #Chamber of commerce. \n3.  As a subjective matter it violates 14-17 ammendments designed to safe guard  equal rights to vote.\n4.  There is additionally the open question - why should polling places be decorous?  Why should the end of the process not be a fracas?\n5.  personally, I question the voting booth as a nonpublic forum.  Seem like its the definition of public, to me.  Examining the justices Kegan seems persuadable to strike\nBreyer also. \nGorsuch and Roberts could go either way. Finally there is the question of agency.  Four Justices felt strongly enough about this case - might be the strangest fact of all.  The issues here are relatively minor - except 4 judges thought not.

There to are a lot of voter's rights questions incoming on the ballot, from gerrymandering,  to voter ID, to voter challenge.   I think this case was accepted to read the tea leaves.

Surely, most election volunteers can interpret whether political apparel or flashing lights worn on the head are solicitous or not. In fact, they have been doing it in Minnesota for over 100 years since the law was enacted and this is the first challenge.

But review of the Justice's questions demonstrates why, on its face, this law may be potentially unenforceable.  Firstly, it requires election officers make judgments regarding the political nature of free speech. But if it is ok to wear a shirt with the text of the 1st amendment, why would it NOT be ok to wear one with the text of the 2nd amendment?  Secondly, the issue of political speech becomes relative. The State suggested that political apparel could be potentially acceptable if it did not address the bill up for vote. If this was true, then a \"White Power\" button would be potentially allowable if the bill were about women's rights, but not if it was about voter ID (or another potentially racially-tinged subject). Thirdly, what is considered political speech may vary over time. The Second Amendment had been relatively insignificant for nearly 200 years until it rose to prominence in 1967 with Bobby Seale and the Black Panthers. If cases were to be challenged by high courts - possibly years or decades later - which standard would courts use regarding what constituted political speech? Interestingly, Justices do not appear to taking sides solely based on political leanings. For instance, Kagan may lean towards overturning the law because she views polls as the culmination of a \"rowdy political process.\" Ginsburg spent a considerable amount of time exploring the limits of the current law, which at times, illustrated how difficult it was to establish any consistent criteria. On the other hand, Sotomayor argued that a \"Please ID Me\" button could constitute voter intimidation and should be outlawed, suggesting support of the law. We can see similar splits among the traditionally Conservative justices, too. I count 2 justices who support the current law (Breyer, Sotomayor), 5 against (Alito, Garsuch, Kagan, Ginsberg and likely Thomas), and 2 unclear (Roberts, Kennedy). https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument.../16-1435_f2ag.pdf"], [32258, "2018-03-01T02:23:41Z", [0.05], "A facial attack is typically described as one where \u201cno application of the statute would be constitutional.\u201d In contrast, courts define an \"as applied\" challenge as one \u201cunder which the plaintiff argues that a statute, even though generally constitutional, operates unconstitutionally as to him or her because of the\nplaintiff\u2019s particular circumstances.\u201d\n__________________\nComment: I think it natural for SCOTUS to go with the particular circumstances.
