So far there are hundreds of those with most of those accounts involving violence against more than one person - the number as told could easily reach 1000. To link 'armed group' and violent death, there are really only surviving eye-witness accounts and they might take months or years to work through international court system.  There is more vocal condemnation from other countries including Western ones, against (compared to what characterized Rwanda, Somalia, Afghanistan, etc)  although it doesn't goes as far as to intervene.
