Trump has already announced he does not support extending the tax credits from the 2008 act beyond the existing parameters.

I'll only beat the average by 0.0182 Brier points.  So there isn't much downside for betting on the longshot having a slightly greater probability, but keeping the odds still fairly slim. If I bet that it won't happen, but put the odds at 13%, and it doesn't happen, the score is calculated as follows:  Brier points = (0-0.13)^2 + (1-0.87)^2 +  = 0.0338 Brier points.

I've convinced myself that I've been approaching this forecasting thing all wrong.  At times I've gone with the consensus, but gone with a more extreme forecast.

I will interpret \"eliminating the unit limit per manufacturer\" to mean that an increase of the limit is not an elimination of the limit. This also makes sense given that past bills only proposed an elimination (see below), not an increase. Base rate for any introduced bill to pass is only 4%. [7] I'd assume it's even lower for partisan bills (unless they control both chambers of Congress). Several bills in this space have been proposed from what I can tell.\n- Last July an elimination of the *unit* cap was proposed \"Electric CARS Act\". [1] This was not a bipartisan effort and the source deems the bills \"too ambitious\". The same (?) bill was also introduced in the Senate (?) in September. [2] Again, a democratic, not bipartisan effort. It will probably be reintroduced this year. [3] Rep. Khanna has now proposed a similar bill, pushing for the elimination of the *unit* cap. [4]\n- In April 2019, a \"bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers introduced legislation on Wednesday to expand the electric vehicle tax credit by 400,000 vehicles per manufacturer. [...] The bill is sponsored by Democratic Senators Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters, Republican Senators Lamar Alexander and Susan Collins and Democratic Representative Dan Kildee. [...] GM and Tesla shares rose on Reuters report that the bill would be introduced. Tesla shares recently traded up nearly 1 percent, while GM was up 0.2 percent. [...] The bill dubbed the \u201cDriving America Forward Act\u201d would grant each automaker a $7,000 tax credit for an additional 400,000 vehicles on top of the existing 200,000 vehicles eligible for $7,500 tax credits. [...] The proposal has strong backing from automakers, environmental groups and others, but will face opposition. Last month, the White House proposed immediately eliminating the $7,500 tax credit, a move it said would save the U.S. government $2.5 billion over a decade. Senator John Barrasso, a Republican who chairs the Environment and Public Works Committee, in February proposed legislation to end the credit and impose a highway user fee on EVs to pay for road repairs. The bill is backed by major automakers including GM, Tesla, Toyota Motor Corp, Ford Motor Co, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, Honda Motor Co, BMW AG, Nissan Motor Co, Volkswagen AG and utilities.\" [5] I assign much more probability to the latter bill being passed (a unit *extension*, not elimination). It has bipartisan support and the explicit backing of the relevant industry groups (although I'd assume they'd also support the elimination bill). Any opposition to it will also work against the elimination bill. The elimination bill already failed to pass lat year. I also looked at the legislative effectiveness ratings of the people involved (those I could find) [6]:  ELIMINATION:\n- Heinrich: 0.649\n- Merkley: 0.993\n- Masto: 0.150\n- Rosen: 0.472\n- couldn't find Walsh\n- AVERAGE: 0.556 ELIMINATION:\n- Khanna: 1.421 \n- AVERAGE: 1.421 UNIT EXTENSION:\n- Stabenow:  0.551\n- Peters: 1.634\n- Alexander: 1.364\n- Collins: 1.756\n- Kildee: 0.224\n- AVERAGE: 1.1058 This also gives a 2x edge to the unit extension bill (ignoring Khanna for now since it's only been planned). Overall, I'd give about a 2% chance of unit elimination passing.

[1]. The tax credits are on the one hand popular with climate hawk democrats. At the same time, they draw ire from lawmakers who just see them as a way to allow rich people to buy cool cars. That's not a totally inaccurate view of the tax credits as their short term effect is indeed to make expensive cars slightly cheaper for those who can afford to buy a 50k+ car. Their long term effect is in fact to bring EV technology down its learning curve and usher an era of affordable EVs. But lawmakers may ignore long-term considerations in favor of more pressing issues for their constituents. There is high profile opposition against the credits. Trump administration has planned to end the tax credit. [2] Senator Barrosso (R), Senate Environment and Public Works Chairmam, has introduced legislation to end them [3]. On the other hand, some senators/representatives on both sides of the isle have introduced bills to extend them [3]. An extension is a possibility if Democrats are willing to push hard enough for one in exchange for compromise on other matters.  A potential reference class: tax credits for wind turbines were removed and reinstated several times in the last few decades. But wind turbines provide cheap power to communities across America and draw support across the political spectrum. Not sure EVs are quite in the same category, yet.
