My forecast relies on the low probability that two out of three \"swing vote\" senators (Manchin, Flake, and Collins) will change their vote at the last minute. First, Susan Collins is arguably the most unlikely to change her vote as she delivered a lengthy, detailed speech laying out the reasons for her support of Kavanaugh. She asserted that the burden of evidence did not reach a \"more likely than not\" probability that Dr. Ford's accusations were accurate. (https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/05/us/politics/collins-murkowski-kavanaugh.html) Due to the length at which she expressed her opinion and position, reversing on those statements would be difficult and politically dangerous. Second, Joe Manchin additionally unlikely to change his position as he also provided a detailed explanation of his support and is in a vulnerable position as he is up for reelection in November and is a Democrat in a conservative state. (https://www.msnbc.com/ali-velshi/watch/sen-merkley-fbi-investigation-useless-basically-a-cover-up-1336936003853) Lastly, Senator Flake, stated his support for Kavanaugh yesterday, deeming that it would take \"something big to change\" to alter his vote.

EDIT: post mortem: I got a Brier of 0.08 and Median of 0.013 (100% participation). So, what can we learn from the outcome? A first lesson for me is about black swans. I was forecasting a 99 for a long time initially but was that warranted? We will never know. Still, the sexual assault allegations demonstrate that even when all the conventional factors align (well-qualified candidate, a Republican Senate majority well aligned with its president and able to hold the party line, and no filibuster) you still cannot guarantee virtual certainty of the outcome due to unknown unknowns. On GJO, there is a bit of an incentive to up your confidence a few percentage points to gain on other forecasters. However, it's worth remembering that this only gives you a minuscule Brier advantage when you are already in the +90 area. Second, one should be mindful of over-correcting. Again, we will never know if those of us who reacted more strongly to the sexual assault allegations were wrong in our forecasts. We cannot know if the chances on Sept 26 really were 45% or not (unless we have 1,000 identical Planet Earths where the same situation can play out again and again). Still, a human tends to overreact to recent, salient information: during the confirmation process, the allegations are front and center in one's mind, while the base rate (be it the base rate about past confirmations or the base rate of Republicans voting party line) is somewhere deeper in the memory, leading to Availability Bias, or what Kahneman calls: What You See Is All There Is. The way to know whether one over-corrects is to make many forecasts and tally them up at the end. So the fact that I got a Brier higher than the Median on this particular question cannot provide a definitive answer. Instead, it serves as a reminder of the availability bias.  It's also a reminder of the importance of using Bayes' rule to incorporate new information.

I think it's more probable that the findings are inconclusive. \nAnother serious possibility is that the investigation uncovers something that, while not incriminating (with regard to Ford's claims), contradicts a statement he made in during questioning.

It is not that the monarch himself, who had been your oppressor, was compelled to recognize you as a sovereign and independent people, and that the nation, whose feelings of fraternity for you had slumbered in the lap of pride, was awakened in the arms of humiliation to your equal and no longer contested rights. The primary purpose of this declaration, the proclamation to the world of the causes of our revolution, is \u201cwith the years beyond the flood.\u201d It is of no more interest to us than the chastity of Lucretia, or the apple on the head of the child of Tell. Little less than 40 years have revolved since the struggle for independence was closed; another generation has arisen; and in the assembly of nations our republic is already a matron of mature age. The cause of your independence is no longer upon trial. The final sentence upon it has long since been passed upon earth and ratified in heaven. The interest, which in this paper has survived the occasion upon which it was issued; the interest which is of every age and every clime; the interest which quickens with the lapse of years, spreads as it grows old, and brightens as it recedes, is in the principles which it proclaims. It was the first solemn declaration by a nation of the only legitimate foundation of civil government. It was the corner stone of a new fabric, destined to cover the surface of the globe. It demolished at a stroke the lawfulness of all governments founded upon conquest. It swept away all the rubbish of accumulated centuries of servitude. It announced in practical form to the world the transcendent truth of the unalienable sovereignty of the people. It proved that the social compact was no figment of the imagination; but a real, solid, and sacred bond of the social union. From the day of this declaration, the people of North America were no longer the fragment of a distant empire, imploring justice and mercy from an inexorable master in another hemisphere. They were no longer children appealing in vain to the sympathies of a heartless mother; no longer subjects leaning upon the shattered columns of royal promises, and invoking the faith of parchment to secure their rights. They were a nation, asserting as of right, and maintaining by war, its own existence. A nation was born in a day. \u201cHow many ages hence shall this their lofty scene be acted o\u2019er in states unborn, and accents yet unknown?\u201d It will be acted o\u2019er, fellow citizens, but it can never be repeated. It stands, and must forever stand alone, a beacon on the summit of the mountain, to which all the inhabitants of the earth may turn their eyes for a genial and saving light, till time shall be lost in eternity, and this globe itself dissolve, nor leave a wreck behind. It stands forever, a light of admonition to the rulers of men; a light of salvation and redemption to the oppressed. So long as this planet shall be inhabited by human beings, so long as man shall be of social nature, so long as government shall be necessary to the great moral purposes of society, and so long as it shall be abused to the purposes of oppression, so long shall this declaration hold out to the sovereign and to the subject the extent and the boundaries of their respective rights and duties; founded in the laws of nature and of nature\u2019s God. Five and forty years have passed away since this Declaration was issued by our fathers; and here are we, fellow citizens, assembled in the full enjoyment of its fruits, to bless the Author of our being for the bounties of his providence, in casting our lot in this favored land; to remember with effusions of gratitude the sages who put forth, and the heroes who bled for the establishment of this Declaration; and, by the communion of soul in the reperusal and hearing of this instrument, to renew the genuine Holy Alliance of its principles, to recognize them as eternal truths, and to pledge ourselves and bind our posterity to a faithful and undeviating adherence to them. Fellow citizens, our fathers have been faithful to them before us. When the little band of their Delegates, \u201cwith a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, for the support of this declaration, mutually pledged to each other their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor,\u201d from every dwelling, street, and square of your populous cities, it was re-echoed with shouts of joy and gratulation! And if the silent language of the heart could have been heard, every hill upon the surface of this continent which had been trodden by the foot of civilized man, every valley in which the toil of your fathers had opened a paradise upon the wild, would have rung, with one accordant voice, louder than the thunders, sweeter than the harmonies of the heavens, with the solemn and responsive words, \u201cWe swear.\u201d The pledge has been redeemed. Through six years of devastating but heroic war, through nearly 40 years of more heroic peace, the principles of this declaration have been supported by the toils, by the vigils, by the blood of your fathers and of yourselves. The conflict of war had begun with fearful odds of apparent human power on the side of the oppressor. He wielded at will the collective force of the mightiest nation in Europe. He with more than poetic truth asserted the dominion of the waves. The power, to whose unjust usurpation your fathers hurled the gauntlet of defiance, baffled and vanquished by them, has even since, stripped of all the energies of this continent, been found adequate to give the law to its own quarter of the globe, and to mould the destinies of the European world. It was with a sling and a stone, that your fathers went forth to encounter the massive vigor of this Goliath. They slung the heaven-directed stone, and \u201cWith heaviest sound, the giant monster fell.\u201d Amid the shouts of victory your cause soon found friends and allies in the rivals of your enemies. France recognized your independence as existing in fact, and made common cause with you for its support. Spain and the Netherlands, without adopting your principles, successively flung their weight into your scale. \u2026 The Declaration of Independence pronounced the irrevocable decree of political separation, between the United States and their people on the one part, and the British king, government, and nation on the other. It proclaimed the first principles on which civil government is founded, and derived from them the justification before earth and heaven of this act of sovereignty. But it left the people of this union, collective and individual, without organized government. In contemplating this state of things, one of the profoundest of British statesmen, in an ecstasy of astonishment exclaimed, \u201cAnarchy is found tolerable!\u2019 But there was no anarchy. From the day of the Declaration, the people of the North American union, and of its constituent states, were associated bodies of civilized men and christians, in a state of nature, but not of anarchy. They were bound by the laws of God, which they all, and by the laws of the gospel, which they nearly all, acknowledged as the rules of their conduct. They were bound by the principles which they themselves had proclaimed in the declaration. They were bound by all those tender and endearing sympathies, the absence of which, in the British government and nation, towards them, was the primary cause of the distressing conflict in which they had been precipitated by the headlong rashness and unfeeling insolence of their oppressors. They were bound by all the beneficent laws and institutions, which their forefathers had brought with them from their mother country, not as servitudes but as rights. They were bound by habits of hardy industry, by frugal and hospitable manners, by the general sentiments of social equality, by pure and virtuous morals; and lastly they were bound by the grappling-hooks of common suffering under the scourge of oppression. Where then, among such a people, were the materials for anarchy! Had there been among them no other law, they would have been a law unto themselves. They had before them in their new position, besides the maintenance of the independence which they had declared, three great objects to attain; the first, to cement and prepare for perpetuity their common union and that of their posterity; the second, to erect and organize civil and municipal governments in their respective states: and the third, to form connections of friendship and of commerce with foreign nations. For all these objects, the same Congress which issued the Declaration, and at the same time with it, had provided. They recommended to the several states to form civil governments for themselves; with guarded and cautious deliberation they matured a confederation for the whole Union; and they prepared treaties of commerce, to be offered to the principal maritime nations of the world. All these objects were in a great degree accomplished amid the din of arms, and while every quarter of our country was ransacked by the fury of invasion. The states organized their governments, all in republican forms, all on the principles of the Declaration. The confederation was unanimously accepted by the thirteen states: and treaties of commerce were concluded with France and the Netherlands, in which, for the first time, the same just and magnanimous principles, consigned in the Declaration of Independence, were, so far as they could be applicable to the intercourse between nation and nation, solemnly recognized. When experience had proved that the confederation was not adequate to the national purposes of the country, the people of the United States, without tumult, without violence, by their delegates all chosen upon principles of equal right, formed a more perfect union, by the establishment of the federal constitution. This has already passed the ordeal of one human generation. In all the changes of men and of parties through which it has passed, it has been administered on the same fundamental principles. Our manners, our habits, our feelings, are all republican; and if our principles had been, when first proclaimed, doubtful to the ear of reason or the sense of humanity, they would have been reconciled to our understanding and endeared to our hearts by their practical operation. In the progress of 40 years since the acknowledgment of our independence, we have gone through many modifications of internal government, and through all the vicissitudes of peace and war, with other mighty nations. But never, never for a moment have the great principles, consecrated by the Declaration of this day, been renounced or abandoned. And now, friends and countrymen, if the wise and learned philosophers of the older world, the first observers of mutation and aberration, the discoverers of maddening ether and invisible planets, the inventors of Congreve rockets and shrapnel shells, should find their hearts disposed to inquire, what has America done for the benefit of mankind? Let our answer be this\u2013America, with the same voice which spoke herself into existence as a nation, proclaimed to mankind the inextinguishable rights of human nature, and the only lawful foundations of government. America, in the assembly of nations, since her admission among them, has invariably, though often fruitlessly, held forth to them the hand of honest friendship, of equal freedom, of generous reciprocity. She has uniformly spoken among them, though often to heedless and often to disdainful ears, the language of equal liberty, equal justice, and equal rights. She has, in the lapse of nearly half a century, without a single exception, respected the independence of other nations, while asserting and maintaining her own. She has abstained from interference in the concerns of others, even when the conflict has been for principles to which she clings, as to the last vital drop that visits the heart. She has seen that probably for centuries to come, all the contests of that Aceldama, the European World, will be contests between inveterate power, and emerging right. Wherever the standard of freedom and independence has been or shall be unfurled, there will her heart, her benedictions and her prayers be. But she goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy. She is the well-wisher to the freedom and independence of all. She is the champion and vindicator only of her own. She will recommend the general cause, by the countenance of her voice, and the benignant sympathy of her example. She well knows that by once enlisting under other banners than her own, were they even the banners of foreign independence, she would involve herself, beyond the power of extrication, in all the wars of interest and intrigue, of individual avarice, envy, and ambition, which assume the colors and usurp the standard of freedom. The fundamental maxims of her policy would insensibly change from liberty to force. The frontlet upon her brows would no longer beam with the ineffable splendor of freedom and independence; but in its stead would soon be substituted an imperial diadem, flashing in false and tarnished lustre the murky radiance of dominion and power. She might become the dictatress of the world: she would be no longer the ruler of her own spirit.\n                    *                                *\nMy countrymen, fellow-citizens, and friends; could that Spirit, which dictated the Declaration we have this day read, that Spirit, which \u201cprefers before all temples the upright heart and pure,\u201d at this moment descend from his habitation in the skies, and within this hall, in language audible to mortal ears, address each one of us, here assembled, our beloved country, Britannia ruler of the waves, and every individual among the sceptred lords of humankind; his words would be, \u201cGo thou and do likewise!\u201d John Quincy Adams (1767-1848) was the sixth president of the United States (1825-1829).

A White House official confirmed that Swetnick's claims will not be pursued as part of the reopened background investigation into Kavanaugh... But as of now, the FBI cannot ask the supermarket that employed Judge for records verifying when he was employed there, one of the sources was told. Ford said in congressional testimony Thursday that those records would help her narrow the time frame of the alleged incident which she recalls happening some time in the summer of 1982 in Montgomery County, Maryland. Two sources familiar with the investigation said the FBI will also not be able to examine why Kavanaugh\u2019s account of his drinking at Yale University differs from those of some former classmates, who have said he was known as a heavy drinker. Those details may be pertinent to investigating claims from Ramirez who described an alleged incident of sexual misconduct she said occurred while Kavanaugh was inebriated. Ramirez's lawyer said Saturday that she had been contacted by the FBI and would cooperate. The conditions under which the FBI's reopened background check are occurring appears to differ from the one envisioned by Flake, who used his leverage as a swing vote to pressure the Trump administration to order the FBI investigation.

Today we will see if McConnell has the votes. My reasoning is all it takes is one vote on Committee. If Flake does vote to move the nomination to the floor, my guess is that he and John McCain from the grave will put paid. Thumbs down on floor. Could be 52-49 if Murkowski joins the party. I suspect that  Corker will vote yes. For political reasons One of his best friends former Dem. Gov. Breedesen is far out frnt in the race to succeed him as Senator. It seems the only matter that could turn the race upside down, would be a Corker no vote on K.

And so far neither Ford nor Ramirez has been able to produce a corroborating witness. That doesn't mean they won't - I don't know, and neither does anybody else on GJO, the protestations of certainty on both sides notwithstanding. If the accusers testify (in my opinion, one or both possibly may not), and there are still no corroborating witnesses, and still some confusion about when, where, and even if the person involved was indeed Kavanaugh, we will essentially be back at square one. You will have an accusation that opponents of Kavanaugh are likely to believe, or at least use as an excuse to vote against him, but it will be strictly an accusation, leaving the matter as \"he said, she said.\"  So in that case, the question for senators from conservative-leaning states is whether they believe that they will pay a political cost for disqualifying someone from public life on the basis of an accusation. Such senators would have to a) believe the accusation and b) have the courage to pay the price for voting against Kavanaugh even if a majority of their constituents believed that an accusation, by itself and without corroboration, should not sink a public figure. If the accusers are seen by the public as unconvincing, it will be easy for Collins, Murkowski, et al. to vote to confirm, which is why - at this stage anyway - I think they will.

I think this week will continue to be a crazy ride, but I think by early next week Republicans will try to pull it all back together for a final vote.  They don't want to backtrack and have every motivational reason for digging in their heels.  And the longer this rolls out, the worse the public political backlash will be (for both sides) as it makes both sides look bad and increases the likelihood of every angry person going to the polls in the midterms, which usually doesn't work out so well for incumbents.  Also, they need another judge on the bench now for the Oct session of SCOTUS and they need it before the midterms, which are too close to gamble with.  So Republicans have a lot to lose but most to lose from any further delay, and submitting a new name almost certainly means a delay beyond the timeline of the question.   I think it comes down to who is able/willing to change votes on the Republican side, and Collins & Murkowski aren't up for re-election and come from states who would be happier down the road if they stay to course and vote to confirm.  Heller is a challenge because he's already staked a claim as a Trump Republican and in a state that is moving blue with moderates (mostly 20-45 year olds) who lean left on most policies (except size of gov), and he's been down in the polls for a while.  He's got a passable line for how he can support Trump while disagreeing with the 20% bizarre stuff Trump gets caught up in as his \"reality show\" shtick.  But he can't really distance himself from Republicans, and frankly, Republican women are only slightly more likely to find Blasey Ford's story as believable and Republican men and women have remained largely consistent in support if not more supportive and vocal.  So at this point he is better going for a confirmation to hold the Republican line and show he's not going to waver; even if he loses the election in November, he won't lose because Republicans were so disgusted with him they wouldn't bother to go to the polls.   I think it would take a lot to break the majority on this one, and if the majority broke, it would be a huge blow, both in terms of perception and momentum.  With so much recent partisan bitterness, a hotly contested confirmation will just be chalked up as a partisan bickering match even if the long term effects are worse for Republicans (based on younger generations being much less happy with partisan politics and with recent Republican platforms and arguments in general), and I think they couldn't really be worse for Republicans if they vote Yes when there is sufficient evidence to suggest that Kavanaugh has a reasonably probability of getting drunk and doing something like this even if he's been a model politician-for-future-leadership ever since he threw his cap and took off for his first job.  Flake is an interesting person to watch though.  I don't think he wants to delay the vote or give up Kavanaugh.  But he's not stupid, asks sharp questions, and isn't bullied by his party (I assume because he plans to for serious leadership in the near or distant future and is likely to get it, especially when the next few Senate elections pass, which would mean he has slightly more to lose than many of the ranking Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee).

Her story largely checks out over time to multiple (and reasonably private) witnesses.  It has the advantage of an FBI investigation that started before it was public, so information already exists to substantiate her claims with documentary evidence and the lie detector test, which makes it hard to manage a full-blown discreditation case while the evidence is being explored.  Even Fox news is reporting the facts as they stand and suggesting that it is merely \"irrelevant\" to the qualifications expected for Kavanaugh to be judge (rather like arguments that Clinton's personal sex life had nothing to do with how he made decisions in office?)  It also sounds as though Blasey Ford's willingness to come forward quickly when the rumors escalated will be somewhat helpful.  The challenge for Kavanaugh (and Mark Judge) is that they categorically denied the incident.  They may have been better off saying they remembered no such thing and thought it absurd, since people doing horrible shit when they're drunk can at least excuse \"memory\" lapses.   But her evidence is at least reasonably substantial in the face of such a strong denial, and since Blasey Ford has little or no reason to have made such claims repeatedly over the years to so many intimate friends and family members, long before Kavanaugh's nomination was a thing, I think it will extremely hard to brush this off.  And that means at least 2 weeks of rabid investigations into everyone Kavanaugh and Judge went to school with and anyone who knew them willing to say that they 1) got trashed on a regular basis, 2) had any kind of misconduct during that period of high school or college, and 3) had any other incidents of sexual misconduct.  If they come up with anything, it hurts Kavanaugh, Judge, the Republicans, the nomination process, and the midterm elections, especially in swing states.   Already moderate conservatives in many areas are suggesting that they prefer to get back to the pre-Trump \"normal\" where they could care about traditionally Republican things without feeling pressured to back Trump and the current Republican agenda - economy, removal of expensive personal requirements for ACA, and moderate balance in other areas between regulations and freedoms so that life can happen without undue stress.

Statistically speaking there is very good reason to think that even if it would be hard to dig up stuff on Kavanaugh, digging up stuff on Judge wouldn't be so hard since he hasn't lived in hope of a public/political career.  There would have to be a lot of people willing to circle the wagons for both of them to clear this one, and Judge doesn't seem like the type to take one for the team.)  But Republican leaders have already doubled down on Kavanaugh and the list of supporters they already had sign the letter may or may not be willing to stay the course - but they're now implicated and have to put their reputations on the line along with a new kind of public scrutiny.  And even if nothing is conclusively proven regarding Blasey Ford's allegations, it can't help Republicans or midterm elections.  So if they keep Kavanaugh, they may lose needed support in some key races.

The first is obvious and momentous; the second is less obvious, but perhaps even more significant. The first is Justice Anthony Kennedy\u2019s retirement and the fight to confirm his successor; the second is a slow-motion collision of profound constitutional powers: those of prosecution, pardon, and impeachment. For the first, we are mainly spectators; the second will call ultimately for our own deliberation and decision. Justice Kennedy\u2019s retirement sparked a national conversation\u2014shouting match, really\u2014over the Court and the Constitution. Of course, every Supreme Court vacancy in the post-Bork era sparks intense argument. The late Justice Antonin Scalia warned, in Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992), that Supreme Court appointments will necessarily be controversial so long as the Court\u2019s work entails making value judgments on behalf of the nation: If, indeed, the \u201cliberties\u201d protected by the Constitution are, as the Court says, undefined and unbounded, then the people should demonstrate, to protest that we do not implement their values instead of ours. Not only that, but confirmation hearings for new Justices should deteriorate into question and answer sessions in which Senators go through a list of their constituents\u2019 most favored and most disfavored alleged constitutional rights, and seek the nominee\u2019s commitment to support or oppose them. Value judgments, after all, should be voted on, not dictated; and if our Constitution has somehow accidentally committed them to the Supreme Court, at least we can have a sort of plebiscite each time a new nominee to that body is put forward.\nBut whatever the baseline for Supreme Court confirmation acrimony might now be, the fight for Kennedy\u2019s vacant seat will surpass it. President Donald Trump is replacing the Court\u2019s longtime \u201cswing justice,\u201d which will shift the Court\u2019s ideological center of gravity on at least some significant issues. Even in tranquil times, this nomination would be a political knife fight. In the most venomous political year of recent memory, this nomination could become even bloodier, capable of exceeding in rancor even the attempted \u201chigh-tech lynching\u201d of Clarence Thomas and the successful character assassination of Robert Bork. Indeed, President Trump had not even announced his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh when the New York Times called upon \u201cDemocrats and progressives to take a page from \u2018The Godfather\u2019 and go to the mattresses on\u201d the not-yet-announced nomination. Perhaps the Times deserves credit for understatement; mob warfare may understate the partisan furies that will be unleashed upon Kavanaugh. Still, we should not let the worst aspects of the confirmation process overshadow its best aspects. Each Supreme Court vacancy is an occasion for the nominee, the president, and the senators to look squarely at the Court\u2019s role in our constitutional republic. And though each confirmation hearing tends to focus greatly on familiar disputes\u2014as always, Roe v. Wade\u2014the senators inevitably invoke current controversies in their rhetorical questions to the nominee. Thus, each nomination is a product of its time\u2014the John Roberts and Samuel Alito hearings raised post-9/11 questions of presidential powers in wartime; the Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor hearings raised questions of campaign-finance reform; the Neil Gorsuch hearing raised questions of religious liberty and, as usual, of Donald Trump. In that respect, Supreme Court confirmation hearings remind us that our momentary political debates ride atop deeper, timeless constitutional debates; a Supreme Court nomination provides the opportunity for the senators and all of us to focus on those deeper themes. And while we may complain that judges play an outsized role in American politics, the fact remains that we put them at the center of our constitutional debates. For even those of us who bristle at the notion of \u201cjudicial supremacy\u201d tend to invoke judicial authority in support of our own constitutional arguments\u2014we always have. Nearly two centuries ago, when Alexis de Tocqueville studied American democracy, he observed that there is \u201cno political event in which [one] does not hear the authority of the judge invoked.\u201d Yes, nearly all political questions are eventually resolved into judicial questions, as Tocqueville famously observed. But even before those questions reach the courts, we invoke the authoritative views of judges. Which, in turn, vests those judges with political authority. - TWS"], [58548, "2018-09-02T13:14:26Z", [1.0], ""], [1479, "2018-09-02T06:49:49Z", [1.0], ""], [29054, "2018-09-02T01:59:50Z", [1.0], ""], [29054, "2018-09-02T01:59:16Z", [0.85], ""], [1333, "2018-09-01T15:48:47Z", [0.86], ""], [47482, "2018-09-01T14:02:23Z", [0.98], "Affirming"], [23006, "2018-09-01T03:07:24Z", [1.0], ""], [32258, "2018-09-01T01:38:27Z", [1.0], "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/08/30/brett-kavanaugh-neil-gorsuch-learned-supreme-court-ropes-together/1050836002/ @lsgold7 This article is helpful hindsight regarding Kennedy and his legacy."], [3345, "2018-08-31T19:11:42Z", [1.0], ""], [58668, "2018-08-31T02:35:08Z", [0.8], ""], [1056, "2018-08-30T19:00:21Z", [1.0], ""], [1333, "2018-08-30T17:10:02Z", [0.85], "The U.S. Senate confirmed seven nominees to federal district courts on Tuesday, where they will serve lifetime terms.

Former officials believe millions of pages of emails and other documents circulated through Kavanaugh's office during his time as staff secretary. If Senate Democrats insist on receiving every page, the confirmation process could grind to a crawl.\n. . . \nDemocrats say they're only asking for the same thing the Senate has demanded for other high court nominees. When President Barack Obama tapped Kagan in 2010, the National Archives undertook a massive effort to release 170,000 pages of records from her tenure as a policy adviser and lawyer in President Bill Clinton's White House. \"Brett Kavanaugh spent 5 years in the Bush White House. He undoubtedly sent tens of thousands of emails. All of those are public record and Democrats and the media should demand that they be posted online like Elena Kagan's emails were,\" . . . The volume of records at issue is likely to slow the timeline for confirmation hearings and may make any hearing before the August recess out of the question. Asked Monday about the idea that archivists could review a million pages of records within the next month, former National Archives official Sharon Fawcett said: \"Not possible.\" \u00a0. . .  Assuming not all Kavanaugh records will be ready before his hearing, one key question will be who decides which ones are released.\n. . . \n. . . Democrats are likely to try to play to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley's historical interest in transparency issues and the Freedom of Information Act to make sure senators have robust access to Kavanaugh's record. A White House spokesman and current officials at the Archives did not respond to requests for details on the Kavanaugh-related records and what efforts are being made to prepare them for release. Legally, both Trump and Bush are entitled to more than two months' notice before any files are released, but they can waive those rights.\n. . . \nA broader index of Kavanaugh's files shows still-unreleased folders containing memos on \"perjury (obstruction/false statements),\" shredding of records by Hillary Clinton's former law firm, impeachment, grand jury secrecy issues related to President Bill Clinton's interview about Foster's death, and a conspiracy theory at the time known as the INSLAW Affair. Some Republicans who expressed concern about Trump picking Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court say those documents and others could put him and Trump in an awkward spot by giving fodder to Democrats to ask questions about parallels between Clinton's alleged misdeeds and accusations that Trump lied to the public and obstructed justice.\n. . . \n\u201cWhile working for Ken Starr in 1998, [Kavanaugh] routinely skirted or violated Rule 6 (e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure by leaking details of Lewinsky probe.
