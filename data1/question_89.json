If its score stays about the same but others improve then it could fall out of the top 75. But another way to think about this: On average, in any given YoY transition, 0.1 country will move up at least 25 rankings. Of the 151 countries, is Iran overweight in the probability distribution of being amongst them? Ie should we adjust the base rate up? To get to a probability that even rounds up to 1%, we must believe that Iran is 7 times more likely than average to be the country that experiences this level of jump (which only happens to one country every 9 years). That doesn't sound crazy, they're in a pretty special situation, given that the surveys were done earlier in the year I'm still a bit nervous. To put it another way, what are the chances that Iran are not only the most-improving country, but that their rank improves in a way that the most-improving sees only about once every 10 years. I think below 0.5%. On average, in any given YoY transition, 2.5 countries will move up at least 15 rankings. Of the 151 countries, is Iran overweight in the probability distribution of being amongst them?\nOr in other words, what do we think are Iran's chances of being in the top 2.5 highest-improving countries? Again, I think things are somewhat limited by the early date of the survey, but I think it's fair to say they have a 5x as likely chance of being one of these big movers than usual, or if we assume uniform likelihood across top 25 position making for a 8.5% probability of moving up to 60 or better. On average, every year 57 countries will move down by at least 2 ranks. What are the chances Iran is in the bottom 57 countries in terms of YoY change?

Came across some news that implicates the 6th pillar (Goods Market Efficiency). Feb  21: \"THE PERSIAN RUG TRADE IS BACK IN BUSINESS\" --> http://www.newsweek.com/persian-rugs-iran-sanctions-428789 Sanctions on Iran were all about oil, right? Yes, but a little-known fact is that the international sanctions imposed over the past decade to curb Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions had a devastating effect on its second largest export: the iconic Persian rug. Until January, when President Barack Obama signed an executive order lifting sanctions, all Persian rugs\u2014whether antique or brand-new\u2014were banned from entering the U.S., regardless of how long they had been outside Iran. For instance, a Persian rug sold in London that had not been in Iran for more than a century still could not be shipped to the United States.\n[...]\nIt\u2019s not just the antique Persian rug business that\u2019s taken a hit. Sanctions also eroded the modern rug trade in Iran, according to Hamid Kargar, head of Iran\u2019s National Carpet Center in Tehran. Revenue from all Persian rug exports has fallen from around a billion dollars a year in 2000, the last time sanctions were lifted, to just over $300 million a year today, he tells Newsweek. By 2010, just before the latest round of sanctions were reinstated, Persian rug exports to the U.S. came to around $80 million a year, or 16 percent of Iran\u2019s total shipments.\n[...]\nUnfortunately for the Iranian rug industry, while the U.S. and Iran were engaged in their lengthy standoff, the world moved on to more modern floor coverings. \u201cMillennials are not buying traditional; they\u2019re looking for urban contemporary,\u201d says Richard Amatulli, membership chairman of the Oriental Rug Retailers of America, a nonprofit trade group based in Landrum, South Carolina. \u201cAlso, what\u2019s coming out of Iran is new stuff. All the old stuff, all the great stuff, they already got out. And the new stuff doesn\u2019t have a market yet.\u201d On top of the sanctions, the Great Recession of 2008\u20132009 killed the price of Persian rugs, says Amatulli. \u201cIt\u2019s been devastating to the industry,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve seen some rugs priced at just one-tenth of what they\u2019d been worth after the first round of sanctions in the 1980s.\u201d\n~~~ COMMENT: So some semi-good news, but maybe some other news that also tempers that. Given how important this industry used to be to Iran, I thought it warranted at least a minor bump up to the higher of the two middle bins.

Just to summarize last year's index for Iran in the 12 pillars 1. Institutions - Iran was 94th\n2. Infrastructure - 63rd\n3. Macroeconomic Environment - 66th\n4. Health and Primary Education - 47th\n5. Higher Education and Training -69th\n6. Goods Market Efficiency - 69th\n7. Labor Market Efficiency - 138th\n8. Financial Market Development - 134th\n9. Technological Readiness - 99th\n10. Market Size - 19th\n11. Business Sophistication - 110th\n12. Innovation - 90th The pillars where Iran is ranked lowest and thus has the most potential to improve are, in reverse order\nLabor Market Efficiency (138), Financial Market Development (134), Business Sophistication (110), Technological Readiness (99) and Institutions (94). Since the Rouhani government is primarily responsible for the economy, it could improve pillars such as Financial Market Development and Technological Readiness with relaxation of nuclear-related sanctions.  However, there are only a few months left before the next Index is compiled and it seems unlikely there could be a major improvement in any one pillar, or in the overall index in the time available. There should be an improvement in relative rankings, not only because of the nuclear deal but also because due to sanctions restricting its exports, Iran will be less hurt by low oil prices than other oil exporters. A victory - currently not expected by most observers - for Rouhani's supporters in the upcoming elections could also help. It should be noted that only two pillars (Market Size at #19 and Health and Primary Education, at #47) were in the top 50 last year with none between 51 and 60. On that basis I've been ruling out Iran reaching the top 50 this year.  Similarly, while I'm confident Iran will improve its ranking, I'm less certain about it entering the top 60. The pillars currently in the 61-75 range are Infrastructure (63), Macroeconomic Environment (66), Higher Education and Training (69) and Goods Market Efficiency (69).

Feb 1: \"Sanctions Made Iran Resilient to Low Oil Price, Moody's Says\" --> http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-01/iran-gdp-poised-to-grow-in-aftermath-of-sanctions-moody-s-says In an ironic twist, international sanctions against Iran appear to be benefiting its economy as decades of isolation forced the nation to adapt to low oil prices more quickly than other crude exporters, according to Moody\u2019s Investors Service. Gross domestic product will grow 5 percent in 2016-2017, thanks to a solid foundation built to cope with exclusion from the global financial system, Moody\u2019s said in an e-mailed research note Monday. Removal of sanctions as part of a nuclear deal reached last year will grant Iran access to about $150 billion in its frozen foreign assets, which will be spent on reviving the country\u2019s aging infrastructure, it said. The country also will regain access to the international payment system, lowering trade and financial costs. \u201cInternational sanctions meant that Iran had to adapt to the reality of lower oil revenues and implement structural reforms much earlier than other oil-exporters,\u201d Atsi Sheth, an associate managing director at Moody\u2019s, said in a statement. \u201cMost other oil-dependent sovereigns are only just beginning to consider structural fiscal reform.\u201d Intensification of sanctions in 2012 forced Iran to remove exemptions for some large non-taxpayers and curb fuel subsidies to bring prices closer to market levels. \u201cSince 2013, a combination of prudent policies, including increasing sources of non-oil revenues to pay for higher capital expenditures, combined with partial sanctions relief following the interim nuclear agreement led to a recovery, with real GDP growth at 4.3% in 2014,\u201d Moody\u2019s said in the report. Iran won\u2019t suffer from capital flow volatility amid U.S. interest-rate increases because it has had minimal exposure to external debt and foreign direct investment, Moody\u2019s said. With its $417 billion economy, which is the second-largest in the Middle East after Saudi Arabia and more diversified than other regional oil exporters, Iran has a solid foundation for rapid economic development and growth, Moody\u2019s said. It also benefits from a young, well-educated labor force and a large industrial base, it said. ~~~ COMMENT: So... good (?) news for Iran? Hard to say. The thing that caught my eye was that I found the Bloomberg piece from a Fareed Zakaria OpEd (https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/from-iran-to-nigeria-cheap-oil-means-perilous-politics/2016/02/04/aefcdbb8-cb76-11e5-a7b2-5a2f824b02c9_story.html), which got me thinking about other petrol-dependent economies in the Middle East (and globally). That is, those economies for which oil is important on the supply side (or the demand side). So while Iran may not shoot up the rankings (for a number of reasons), it's possible that the countries around them descend on terribly low oil prices and because Iran's economy was already ready for it, they turn out to be a net positive.\n~ NOTE: I strongly suggest going back and reading my forecast where I reviewed all the pillars/subindexes --> https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/95594"], [43, "2016-02-11T03:22:02Z", [0.0, 0.28, 0.66, 0.06], ""], [110, "2016-02-11T02:35:32Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.69, 0.3], ""], [182, "2016-02-11T02:17:31Z", [0.0, 0.29, 0.71, 0.0], "I expect robust growth in the next year or two as large multinationals, fearing missing out, will invest large amounts of capital.

Here's their reply: \"The Global Competitiveness Report assesses the current state of competitiveness of a country. It is based on hard data and on data from our Executive Opinion Survey. Should you want to know more about the Executive Opinion Survey, please see p. 75 of the report (http://www3.weforum.org/docs/gcr/2015-2016/Global_Competitiveness_Report_2015-2016.pdf ).\" Interestingly, the survey is conducted in 41 languages but Farsi is not one of them.

In the NYT article above, cars, planes, metals, and pharmaceuticals were named. Mapping that onto the pillars: cars, planes, metal (2nd pillar -- INFRASTRUCTURE); pharmaceuticals (4th pillar -- HEALTH AND EDUCATION). [NOTE: I'm going to freely cite from the forecast I mentioned above.] Let's start with the easy one -- pharmaceuticals. Iran was already very strong on this pillar (6.0/7.0) and the only room for improvement I could see was in the primary education system. So, I don't think the news of pharmaceutical deals should have too much of an impact. Next: cars, planes, and metals -- infrastructure. Iran was hovering around the middle (4.2/7.0; second/third quartile) for this pillar, so it's possible that there may be some room for growth with deals like the ones announced. Of particular note in my initial assessment, \"I would say the 'available airline seat kms' might be a place for growth.\" Hmmm, a deal with Airbus will certainly help with that. Of course, the deals won't suddenly mean Iran has 50 more Airbus's tomorrow, but depending upon how the raters view this, it could mean that this bumps up their score on \"Transport Infrastructure,\" which would then bump up their score on the Infrastructure pillar, which would THEN up their score on the \"basic requirements\" subindex.  Given that I'm predicting that Iran is going to move to \"Stage 2,\" this means that the allocation of % to 'basic requirements' is 60% (and there are only 4 'basic requirements' pillars), this could mean more of an overall uptick for Iran. It might be worth noting that of subindexes, 'basic requirements' was Iran's best (second/third quartile), so this uptick might not mean too much, but it's certainly something to keep in mind.

BE SURE TO READ PART 1 for a more quick look at how some of the sanctions relief will have an effect --> https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/95593 Alright -- so let's dig deeper into things to try to game out how that might have an effect on Iran's 2016-2017 rank. 1st Pillar -- INSTITUTIONS (subindex -- basic requirements) 3.6; third quartile\nPUBLIC (property rights, ethics and corruption, undue influence, public-sector performance, security)\nPRIVATE (corporate ethics, accountability) In looking at Iran's score in 15/16 on this pillar (3.6) and their scores on each of the different indicators contained within, there doesn't appear to be much variability from that score. Iran's lowest score here comes from \"Ethics and Corruption\" (3.4) and its highest comes from \"Security\" (4.1). I suspect that given the context of bringing Iran back into the global community, their Ethics/Corruption score might rise slightly, but I don't know if it's enough to push the needle on the whole of this pillar. Hastily Early ASSESSMENT: Push 2nd Pillar -- INFRASTRUCTURE (subindex -- basic requirements) 4.2; second/third quartile\nTRANSPORT (Quality of: overall, roads, railroad, port, air transport; available airline seat kms -- millions of seats km/week)\nELECTRICITY/TELEPHONY (Quality of electricity supply, cell phone subscriptions, fixed-telephone lines) Nothing TOO big here, but I would say the \"available airline seat kms\" might be a place for growth. Iran is bringing up the rear on this indicator and with the sanctions lifted, we could see the flights into Iran increase. Similarly, I wonder if there's an uptick in cell phones in Iran. Hastily Early ASSESSMENT: Push 3rd Pillar --  MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT (subindex -- basic requirements) 4.8; third quartile\nGovernment budget balance\nGross national savings\nInflation\nGovernment debt\nCountry credit rating If you click-through and read this pillar, the biggest \"room for improvement\" for Iran is inflation... and maybe, country credit rating! According to this report, there isn't a credit rating for Iran. With the lifting of sanctions, I suspect that we might see a credit rating that could improve their score. Hastily Early ASSESSMENT: Push 4th Pillar --  HEALTH AND PRIMARY EDUCATION (subindex -- basic requirements) 6.0; first quartile\nHEALTH (infant mortality, life expectancy, diseases)\nPRIMARY EDUCATION (Quality of primary education, primary education enrollment rate  Iran appears to have a relatively strong health/education system, as rated by this structure. The biggest room for improvement would be quality of primary education (anyone know if primary schools are on the rise for Iran?) Hastily Early ASSESSMENT: Push (That concludes the pillars for the BASIC REQUIREMENTS subindex. That will become important at the end.)\n~~~ 5th pillar -- HIGHER EDUCATION AND TRAINING (subindex -- efficiency enhancers) 4.3; second quartile\nQUANTITY OF EDUCATION\nQUALITY OF EDUCATION\nON-THE-JOB-TRAINING  I don't see anything big to talk about here, but I might not know that there are three universities being built in Iran. The noteworthy part here is that while Iran's in the second quartile on this pillar, it's only barely. Hastily Early ASSESSMENT: PUSH 6th pillar -- GOODS AND MARKET EFFICIENCY (subindex -- efficiency enhancers) 4.0; third quartile\nCOMPETITION (Domestic, foreign)\nQUALITY OF DEMAND CONDITIONS (degree of customer orientation) The most important thing to note here is that Iran's \"foreign competition\" score is zilch. Well, that's not true, it says 2.5, but you can see from the scale on the report that they are bringing up the rear (in terms of quartiles). I expect that this, coupled with a *possible* bump in degree of customer orientation, could move the needle on this pillar to move it from the third quartile to the second quartile.  Hastily Early ASSESSMENT: SLIGHTLY UP in 2016/2017 Report 7th pillar -- LABOR MARKET EFFICIENCY (subindex -- efficiency enhancers) 3.2; fourth quartile\nFLEXIBILITY (effect of taxation on incentives to work, hiring and firing practices, etc.)\nEFFICIENT USE OF TALENT (country capacity to retain/attract talent, female participation in labor force) At first blush, this might be a place for Iran to raise its score, but I don't know if the gains from the nuclear deal will be realized in time for some of the indicators on this pillar to showcase that. I could be wrong, but I'd expect this one to stay around the same (unless companies can move into Iran faster than I'm anticipating). This will be one to revisit in a couple of months. Hastily Early ASSESSMENT: PUSH (but worth revisiting in a couple of months) 8th pillar -- FINANCIAL MARKET DEVELOPMENT (subindex -- efficiency enhancers) 2.8; fourth quartile\nEFFICIENCY (Availability/affordability of financial services, ease of access to loans, venture capital availability, etc.)\nTRUSTWORTHINESS AND CONFIDENCE (soundness of banks, regulation of securities, legal rights) This pillar is the bread and butter for raising Iran's score this year. Lifting of sanctions and regaining access to SWIFT will go a long way to raising scores here. It's hard to say how much (as I don't want to analyze. every. single. indicator.) but Iran is in the fourth quartile on nearly every indicator within this pillar). Hastily Early ASSESSMENT: Big UP in 2016/2017 Report  9th pillar -- TECHNOLOGICAL READINESS (subindex -- efficiency enhancers) 3.2; third/fourth quartile\nTECHNOLOGICAL ADOPTION (Availability of latest tech, firm-level tech absorption, FDI and tech transfer)\nICT USE (Internet users, Internet bandwidth, etc.) This pillar is another one that could see gains in the next report. FDI, naturally, will go up, but Iran's internet has been decidedly walled off from the world (VPNs abound!) I don't know if this will mean that there'll be BETTER internet in Iran, but I suspect that given that Iran is opening up its internet borders, that might be the case. Hastily Early ASSESSMENT: Slightly UP in 2016/2017 Report 10th pillar -- MARKET SIZE (subindex -- efficiency enhancers) 5.2; second quartile\nDOMESTIC MARKET SIZE (GDP)\nFOREIGN MARKET SIZE (Exports as a percentage of GDP) Given that Iran is already so high on this pillar, you wouldn't expect there'd be much room for improvement, but if you look to the indicators I mentioned (GDP and exports as a % of GDP), both of them score in the fourth percentile. With Iran having more access to its money and more importantly -- access to selling its oil, I would expect these to rise, even slightly. Hastily Early ASSESSMENT: Slightly UP in 2016/2017 Report (That concludes the pillars for the EFFICIENCY ENHANCERS subindex. That will become important at the end.)\n~~~ 11th pillar -- BUSINESS SOPHISTICATION (subindex -- innovation/sophistication factors) 3.5; third/fourth quartile\nValue chain breadth\nNature of competitive advantage\nWillingness to delegate authority\nState of cluster development There are other indicators here, but I'm not going to list them all. Given the lifting of sanctions, I'd expect that this would (at a minimum), probably stay the same, but more likely rise slightly. Hastily Early ASSESSMENT: Slightly UP in 2016/2017 Report 12th pillar -- INNOVATION (subindex -- innovation/sophistication factors) 3.1; third/fourth quartile\nCapacity for innovation\nCompany spending on R&D\nPCT patent applications Like the 11th pillar, there are other indicators here, but I'm not going to list them all. I don't know if there'll be more \"Innovation\" in Iran for the next report, but will there be less? Again, with the release of sanctions, I suspect that things are moving in a \"positive\" direction, but I can't even hazard a guess here. Hastily Early ASSESSMENT: PUSH ~~~ SUMMARY of the hastily early assessments by subindex: Basic requirements:\nPUSH: 4 Efficiency enhancers:\nPUSH: 2 (with 1 to revisit)\nSlightly UP: 3\nBig UP: 1 Innovation/Sophistication:\nPUSH: 1\nSlightly UP: 1 ~~~ I debated whether to talk about this first or last, and I think it makes the most sense to talk about it at the end. It has to do with how WEF views each country's \"stage of development.\" On page 38 of the 15/16 report (http://www3.weforum.org/docs/gcr/2015-2016/Global_Competitiveness_Report_2015-2016.pdf), check for the \n\"Subindex weights and income thresholds for stages of development.\" [If you'd rather not look at the PDF, you can see it on this FAQ page, too --> http://reports.weforum.org/global-competitiveness-report-2015-2016/faqs/ (click on what is the weight scheme...)] This is important because depending upon a country's standing here, there will be different weights placed on the three subindexes (basic requirements, efficiency enhancers, and innovation and sophistication factors). How are these sorted -- GDP per capita. (Note: here's a link to Iran's GDP per capita --> http://www.tradingeconomics.com/iran/gdp-per-capita) In the 2015/2016 report, Iran's GDP per capita put them into the \"transition from Stage 1 to Stage 2.\" And based on their previous GDP's per capita, it looks like they were in that same stage for the 2014/2015 report. The important thing to not here -- I'm fairly sure (80%) that Iran will now move into a new stage for the 2016/2017 report. Backing up for a moment, the stage they've been at (transition from 1 to 2) has a threshold of 2,000 to 2,999. Iran's GDP the last two years have been approximately 2950 (both years). Based on what I talked about in Part 1 (LINK TO PART 1 HERE), I suspect that Iran will bust through that 2,999-ceiling and move into Stage 2. Now, here are the weights for the two different stages: Transition from 1 to 2:\nBasic requirements -- 40% to 60%\nEfficiency enhancers -- 35% to 50%\ninnovation and sophistication -- 5 to 10% Stage 2:\nBasic requirements -- 40%\nEfficiency enhancers -- 50%\ninnovation and sophistication -- 10% ~ So, let's look at Iran's scores on the different subindexes. Basic requirements: 4.6 (second/third quartile)\nEfficiency enhancers: 3.8 (third quartile)\nInnovation and sophistication: 3.3 (third/fourth quartile) Using these scores and my \"hastily early assessments,\" it appears that Iran can make some headway on the efficiency enhancers (3 slightly up's, 1 big up, and 1 to revisit for a possible slightly up). Let's say Iran is able to raise its total efficiency score by 10% (from 3.8 to 4.2), assuming that everything else with Iran stays the same AND every other country stays the same, that would raise Iran's ranking to 62. Let's say it's also able to get a 3% bump on innovation/sophistication -- that would push them into the top 60. Let's say Iran has a 20% bump in its efficiency enhancers score (and all else is equal) -- that would almost put it into the top 40!! At this point in the forecast, there are so many moving parts, so trying to account for it all (without the aid of a statistical program) is ludicrous. If I had to guess where Iran's \"score\" might land in the next report, I'd expect that they're guarantee to move up to the 4.1 (they came in at 4.09 last year) and are probably a good bet to finish above 4.2. Whether they can push into the 4.3's (or 4.4's!), I don't know. For now, this is where my reporting/analysis will pause.

Given that Iran ranked 69th in 2010, it stands to reason that even if sanctions are lifted Iran will not likely rise in the rankings from where it is now. Further, significant upward movement in the rankings short term is even more unlikely given the availability of oil, and depressed price of oil, which is expected to remain low for the next 18 months.  The wildcard in this calculus is the recent political unrest between Iran & Saudi Arabia which is spilling over to other states in the region bringing even more political and economic instability to Iran.

Iran's situation is summed up here on page 222: http://www3.weforum.org/docs/gcr/2015-2016/Global_Competitiveness_Report_2015-2016.pdf It is classified as a country in transition between factor-driven and efficiency-driven, closing in on efficiency driven status. This means that the weights attributed to the 12 pillars of competitiveness will approach this breakdown:\nBasic requirements 40% (currently 40.9%)\nEfficiency enhancers 50% (currently 49.4%)\nInnovation and sophistication factors 10% (currently 9.8%)\nIn the last report Iran ranked 74 with rank 63, 90 and 102 in basics, efficiency and innovation respectively.  The most pressing issues for the country's economy are difficult access to financing, a high level of inflation, high unemployment, too much government bueraucracy and mismanagement, insufficient infrastructure. Iran's government apears dedicated to getting the sanctions lifted, I think it's highly unlikely they'll cheat. Khamenei has given the negotiators a strong mandate and people are expecting change. In the coming report we could see some progress in the sections-'pillars': macroeconomy (inflation dropping from 15 to 10%, better credit rating), goods market efficiency (additional foreign competition), financial market development (lifting sanctions on banks would be a huge deal), technological readiness (oil and gas tech).\nI don't see how decisive improvements in the labour market, infrastructure, health, education and innovation could occour.

Iran was ranked 66th prior to sanctions in 2012.  A position in the 60s would appear quite likely now that sanctions have been partly lifted.  In general terms, there are not many moves in this ranking of more than 10 places in any single year. Last year, the biggest moves were Cote D'Ivoire with a c.25 place improvement and El Salvador with an 11 place worse ranking than the year before. The vast majority of moves are less than 5 places from the previous year. Economic profiles in the end move slowly, particularly as these are relative to other countries rather than absolute. Worth noting that one of the pillars to this assessment is labour market efficiency. Iran ranks pretty much the worst on the planet here (139th) because of the effective exclusion of women. The country also ranks poorly on general levels of education etc. These type of measures are unlikely to improve just because sanctions are lifted. A move of more than 10 places is hard to justify. That said, a move just one place worse would see them in the >75 category... But it is reasonable to think that the lifting of sanctions will provide a greater boost than any other country in the 50-100 bucket will experience, suggesting that Iran will most likely improve relative to others. On this basis, a weaker ranking is a low probability event given the overwhelming likely impact of the lifting of sanctions. \n"], [691, "2015-12-15T13:53:07Z", [0.0, 0.43, 0.56, 0.01], ""], [306, "2015-12-15T03:11:35Z", [0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0], ""], [1045, "2015-12-14T23:23:12Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.88, 0.02], ""], [368, "2015-12-14T21:05:38Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.9, 0.0], ""], [691, "2015-12-14T21:05:31Z", [0.0, 0.42, 0.57, 0.01], ""], [1028, "2015-12-14T20:30:41Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.8, 0.05], ""], [11788, "2015-12-14T19:02:47Z", [0.0, 0.34, 0.66, 0.0], ""], [53, "2015-12-14T17:33:04Z", [0.02, 0.22, 0.64, 0.12], "Putting more in the bottom bucket on reflection - low oil, potential for mischief from hard-liners (eg. detention of business people can't be good), election unknowns, recent ranking in the 80's (2013, 2014)."], [10759, "2015-12-14T06:11:08Z", [0.05, 0.15, 0.45, 0.35], ""], [4634, "2015-12-14T06:08:42Z", [0.05, 0.15, 0.45, 0.35], ""], [102, "2015-12-14T04:50:02Z", [0.05, 0.22, 0.62, 0.11], "https://larswericson.wordpress.com/2015/12/14/excluding-outliers-in-the-smart-crowd-forecast/"], [12879, "2015-12-14T03:30:51Z", [0.0, 0.25, 0.75, 0.0], ""], [368, "2015-12-13T22:12:36Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.9, 0.0], ""], [691, "2015-12-13T21:48:00Z", [0.0, 0.4, 0.57, 0.03], ""], [10759, "2015-12-13T20:33:14Z", [0.05, 0.2, 0.5, 0.25], ""], [4634, "2015-12-13T20:32:34Z", [0.05, 0.2, 0.5, 0.25], ""], [10759, "2015-12-13T20:13:37Z", [0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 0.2], ""], [12879, "2015-12-13T19:36:17Z", [0.0, 0.25, 0.75, 0.0], ""], [94, "2015-12-13T19:26:32Z", [0.16, 0.26, 0.42, 0.16], "Based on the data in the 6 years since 2011-2012, Iran has gotten an average rank of 73, with a standard deviation of 8.5.

Would say it's unlikely, but wouldn't be surprised. 20%\nDrop in ranks would be surprising with current state of affairs. 5%\n\nhttp://www3.weforum.org/docs/gcr/2015-2016/GCI_Dataset_2006-2015.xlsx\n"], [691, "2015-12-12T13:09:06Z", [0.01, 0.39, 0.56, 0.04], ""], [102, "2015-12-12T05:30:18Z", [0.04, 0.19, 0.59, 0.18], "https://larswericson.wordpress.com/2015/12/12/super-friday-night/"], [706, "2015-12-12T05:10:21Z", [0.01, 0.1, 0.2, 0.69], "oil prices will stay low, Iran will keep dissimulating with inspectors, and the world economy just won't have lots of free cash to invest in Iran."], [12302, "2015-12-12T03:21:18Z", [0.01, 0.34, 0.65, 0.0], ""], [1682, "2015-12-12T00:22:01Z", [0.03, 0.21, 0.53, 0.23], ""], [368, "2015-12-11T22:12:32Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.85, 0.0], ""], [452, "2015-12-11T21:59:13Z", [0.05, 0.1, 0.55, 0.3], ""], [691, "2015-12-11T19:42:56Z", [0.01, 0.39, 0.56, 0.04], ""], [639, "2015-12-11T17:47:18Z", [0.05, 0.15, 0.8, 0.0], ""], [498, "2015-12-11T09:30:31Z", [0.0, 0.14, 0.85, 0.01], ""], [498, "2015-12-11T09:16:30Z", [0.01, 0.15, 0.83, 0.01], ""], [498, "2015-12-11T08:47:22Z", [0.01, 0.24, 0.74, 0.01], ""], [498, "2015-12-11T07:39:34Z", [0.05, 0.45, 0.5, 0.0], ""], [689, "2015-12-11T00:21:41Z", [0.0, 0.08, 0.81, 0.11], ""], [689, "2015-12-11T00:21:31Z", [0.0, 0.08, 0.81, 0.11], ""], [24, "2015-12-10T23:29:05Z", [0.0, 0.2, 0.7, 0.1], ""], [368, "2015-12-10T22:03:16Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.75, 0.2], "Current ranked 74/140 for 2015 - 2016.
