I could be wrong, but I don't think those are huge market teams (don't have time now to check..), leading me to believe \"Sunday after Thanksgiving\" isn't a big drag on viewership (and may even boost it somehow).   @acohen what does your brother think about the popularity of Chiefs & Broncos from last year?

Results / calculations follow. Summary of my approach: \n1) I pulled down the viewership information from the past 2 seasons here: \nhttp://www.sportsmediawatch.com/nfl-tv-ratings-viewership-nbc-cbs-fox-espn-nfln-regular-season-playoffs/ 2) Straight Averaging SNF gives you a result of: 16.5M 3) However, this ignores the teams that played, as such I conducted a team-by-team assessment of viewership. DAL / PIT / GB had the most consistent high-viewership (22.0M / 20.2M / 20.2M, respectively) A number of teams had really low viewership and few data-points (LA, CLE, TEN) all with less than 7 Million. So what about the two playing Sunday? \nPIT: 20.2M (2nd Highest-Tied) \nGB: 20.2M (2nd Highest-Tied)   This puts my Base guess of viewership as: 18.2 = [Avg (20.2, 20.2) + SNF Premium (1.8) + Annual Adjust (-1.6)] * Futon to SMW Ratio (.89%) Words of caution: \n1) Standard Deviation of the errors recently is about 7.5% of the estimate (1.5M in this case). \n2) Both PIT & GB has among the highest viewership \n3) PIT Is currently 8-2, which should boost viewership. \n4) PIT viewership has historically fallen short of the forecasted\n5) The model has worked fairly well for GB (not too high or low)\n6) GB contribution should be haircut (particularly after last week's performance)\n7) Thanksgiving:  Last year, my model over-estimated every game on thanksgiving by a fair amount.  \n8) Downward Trend:  Obviously there is a significant downward trend in viewership.  I've started to account for this in my annual adjustment (now up to a 1.6 reduction for 2017).  However, this has been growing rather than shrinking.  Trend lining the miss would suggest a reduction of 1.8 is necessary for this week. \n9) Mathematically the results for this week are expected to rival last weeks (18.7M) , but that doesn't sound right.

I was really tempted to sit this one out because I have no idea what the impact of all of these external factors will really do."], [12879, "2017-11-22T04:44:37Z", [0.2, 0.15, 0.5, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [5018, "2017-11-22T02:35:40Z", [0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2], ""], [35544, "2017-11-22T02:34:14Z", [0.2, 0.25, 0.25, 0.2, 0.1], ""], [41526, "2017-11-21T21:38:49Z", [0.0, 0.12, 0.52, 0.3, 0.06], ""], [1333, "2017-11-21T20:46:46Z", [0.2, 0.35, 0.25, 0.15, 0.05], ""], [691, "2017-11-21T20:00:03Z", [0.01, 0.08, 0.63, 0.26, 0.02], ""], [34353, "2017-11-21T18:22:32Z", [0.01, 0.07, 0.56, 0.33, 0.03], "Both teams have strong fan bases.
