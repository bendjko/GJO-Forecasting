CFR's Nigeria Security Tracker attributes to Boko Haram 219 deaths between February and April 2018. The number of annual deaths attributed to BH has declined precipitously since its peak in 2015 2) The group is beset by leadership struggles, fractionalization, declining membership, loss of elite support, and shrinking territory 3) The Nigerian military has been accused of being under-equipped to carry on the fight, but recently the US agreed to begin arms sales to Nigeria. Additionally, the Nigerian military has made significant territorial gains on the battlefield, while BH has gained little new territory. ACLED concludes that the Nigerian military's recent declaration of the defeat of BH \"appears to reflect a genuine containment of the insurgency\" 4) Despite this loss of territory, BH members become reliant on stealth and blending in with civilians as well as expanding internationally into neighboring countries 5) The Nigerian government and some factions of BH started ceasefire negotiations at the end of March  CONCLUSION\n-----------\nBoko Haram appears to be on the decline but it still remains a deadly force capable of committing severe atrocities."], [12302, "2018-05-02T23:13:11Z", [0.69], ""], [172, "2018-05-02T01:28:24Z", [0.03], ""], [691, "2018-05-01T15:45:09Z", [0.01], ""], [28166, "2018-04-29T13:35:33Z", [0.01], ""], [1333, "2018-04-29T09:45:58Z", [0.25], ""], [691, "2018-04-25T22:37:45Z", [0.01], ""], [172, "2018-04-25T12:07:27Z", [0.05], ""], [12302, "2018-04-22T14:43:34Z", [0.5], ""], [172, "2018-04-20T00:57:19Z", [0.01], ""], [691, "2018-04-19T13:45:13Z", [0.01], ""], [12302, "2018-04-19T05:53:44Z", [0.6], ""], [50270, "2018-04-16T22:58:09Z", [0.05], ""], [691, "2018-04-16T16:14:09Z", [0.01], ""], [32100, "2018-04-16T16:11:21Z", [0.01], ""], [46339, "2018-04-15T17:59:48Z", [0.05], ""], [55036, "2018-04-15T13:55:36Z", [0.1], ""], [172, "2018-04-13T01:46:21Z", [0.01], ""], [54077, "2018-04-12T11:25:30Z", [0.04], ""], [691, "2018-04-11T16:48:58Z", [0.02], ""], [36147, "2018-04-10T11:28:21Z", [0.08], ""], [691, "2018-04-09T12:07:06Z", [0.02], ""], [12302, "2018-04-09T04:54:31Z", [0.3], ""], [29980, "2018-04-08T19:43:17Z", [0.99], ""], [28166, "2018-04-07T20:50:42Z", [0.02], ""], [40702, "2018-04-07T04:38:50Z", [0.08], ""], [5018, "2018-04-07T01:45:20Z", [0.05], ""], [29054, "2018-04-06T21:50:43Z", [0.0], ""], [30400, "2018-04-06T05:54:26Z", [0.0], ""], [28166, "2018-04-06T02:45:34Z", [0.06], ""], [172, "2018-04-06T00:09:39Z", [0.01], ""], [54040, "2018-04-05T15:56:19Z", [0.0], ""], [56997, "2018-04-05T12:09:58Z", [0.08], ""], [36736, "2018-04-04T20:22:16Z", [1.0], ""], [57175, "2018-04-04T18:16:04Z", [0.1], ""], [12302, "2018-04-04T17:16:57Z", [0.4], ""], [691, "2018-04-04T12:43:28Z", [0.02], ""], [28166, "2018-04-04T09:38:33Z", [0.3], ""], [15196, "2018-04-04T03:16:56Z", [0.1], ""], [39381, "2018-04-03T18:16:43Z", [0.0], ""], [57308, "2018-04-03T16:33:26Z", [0.55], ""], [57507, "2018-04-03T15:43:53Z", [0.1], ""], [691, "2018-04-03T12:53:52Z", [0.02], ""], [12302, "2018-04-02T23:41:11Z", [0.5], ""], [1333, "2018-04-02T22:41:26Z", [0.35], "This is a hot zone that could blow up anytime.
