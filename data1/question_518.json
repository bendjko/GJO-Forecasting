SO accounting for that base rate, the chance of getting killed from a kidnapping is 66%, meaning in 2015 roughly 79 people were killed from kidnaping alone. 7.6% of the target of 1000 deaths. Less than 1% of kidnappings worldwide resulted in >100 people kidnapping. this would only take us 6.6% of the way to 1000 deaths by kidnapping using the worldwide average of chance of death by kidnapping as our base rate. As such i think the chance of killing, systematically, more than 1000 people would be no higher than 5%, possibly lower.   i'm sorry this is very wordy, i;'ve attached the link to the data i've found about all this. https://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/crt/2015/257526.htm feedback is welcome, especially if i'm interpreting the question wrong."], [36405, "2017-08-05T00:43:07Z", [0.2], ""], [368, "2017-08-04T19:40:26Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-08-03T17:42:36Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-08-03T11:29:44Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2017-08-02T17:53:27Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-08-02T12:05:41Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2017-08-01T20:14:02Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-08-01T11:51:21Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2017-07-31T16:44:17Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-07-31T11:27:52Z", [0.01], ""], [691, "2017-07-30T11:12:12Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2017-07-29T16:37:00Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-07-29T12:08:49Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2017-07-28T17:56:05Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-07-27T19:24:40Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-07-27T12:09:38Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2017-07-26T17:23:59Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-07-26T12:12:53Z", [0.01], ""], [13377, "2017-07-26T11:03:01Z", [0.1], ""], [368, "2017-07-25T22:02:51Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-07-25T12:18:56Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2017-07-24T18:47:46Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-07-24T12:21:42Z", [0.01], ""], [36405, "2017-07-24T01:11:42Z", [0.22], ""], [8336, "2017-07-23T21:53:47Z", [0.1], ""], [368, "2017-07-23T19:07:10Z", [0.0], ""], [36324, "2017-07-23T17:55:17Z", [0.12], ""], [691, "2017-07-23T11:38:28Z", [0.01], ""], [35405, "2017-07-23T04:44:07Z", [0.2], ""], [1333, "2017-07-22T19:22:42Z", [0.25], ""], [368, "2017-07-22T18:35:56Z", [0.0], ""], [28091, "2017-07-22T16:44:10Z", [0.12], ""], [691, "2017-07-22T11:18:45Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2017-07-21T18:48:00Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-07-21T11:40:25Z", [0.01], ""], [36405, "2017-07-21T08:03:43Z", [0.25], ""], [36405, "2017-07-21T08:01:57Z", [0.2], ""], [368, "2017-07-20T18:07:42Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-07-20T12:30:09Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2017-07-19T18:49:20Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-07-19T12:33:27Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2017-07-18T16:56:06Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-07-18T12:42:12Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2017-07-17T19:29:21Z", [0.0], ""], [34353, "2017-07-17T16:49:05Z", [0.01], "Without clarification if the drug war (and the subsequent targeting of \"drug dealers\") meets the definition above, it's unlikely this will be resolved as a yes.

Therefore, I assess this as 1%, as there is no major campaign happening between armed forces that would reach this level.
