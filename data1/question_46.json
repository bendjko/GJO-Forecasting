As I'm looking at it now, to correlate the cycle phase to relevant calendar dates, the cycle would need to be measured so as to include two peaks and one trough. Nevertheless, the general trend is down (or at least stable), and I'm hoping this will offset (in terms of risk) the cyclical phase bias.

So, now I need to forecast how much the transactions can grow till first week of Jun'16. I also notice that even the 7-day moving average is quite volatile.

The weekly cycle, particularly the day 6 data, now looks to be exhibiting the typical pattern. I really (now) don't know what I was looking at (then), and apologize for any confusion. If anything, the base of lowest-low (the 7th day) seems to be increasing by 10,000 for the past three weeks, which may be too short a span to generalize from. Update: So, my initial observation was correct after all! It seems that the data for the current daily transaction volume is a continuously updated number, BUT, not updated as in a continuous sum, but rather in some other fashion (perhaps a rolling 24 hour period? or as some sort of rate?) so that it is possible for the last reported daily transaction volume number to decrease. My previous error was not, again, in the observation, but in not realizing that until another (subsequent) daily period is begun, the previous period is not fixed. For example, when I first posted my above correction, the value of the 7th day was 201,905 transactions. Now, as I update this post (a couple, three hours later), the value of the 7th day transactions is 199,586. So, until the 1st day of the next cycle begins, it seems we can't be certain what the 7th day of the current cycle actually is (permanently); or the value of any current day, until that day is no longer current. Update#2: An hour or so later, the value has decreased further to 196,691.

It took less that a day for vocal skepticism and doubters to trigger a retraction by the magazine, although a clear retraction from Andresen was less forthcoming. If this alleged Satoshi, the Australian Craig Wright, wanted to silence doubters, the true Satoshi certainly could by transacting with the large bucket of coins known to date back to earliest days as would be visible in the public ledger. However White has declined to offer any further proof, leaving watchers to speculate as to his true intentions or voracity of his claims.  What would it mean if the real Satoshi did come forward? It may not matter as much as the press coverage implies. One thing the real Satoshi could offer is an authoritative voice to guide the comunity through the decisions on block sizes and other technical controversies sure to come.  Not only would the founder have enormous technical credibility, he also would have clearly aligned interests via skin in the game as his bitcoin holdings are likely among the largest.  Until such time as Wright or other alleged Satoshi's offer proof of access to this wallet, their motives should rightfully be questioned.   As for applicability to this question, I don't see Wright's publicity as likely to draw a mass of transactions, and if anything the flip flopping press coverage could even have a destabilizing effect although I do not expect a catastrophic one on this question's time scale.  As such, this forecast will merely be to correct for the reduced time scale to achieve further growth.  My original forecast's point about the potential 240k capacity constraint remains part of my assumption, and while the current transaction counts show some recent growth, all spikes approaching the 250 mark have been short lasted.

Here's some research that suggests this periodicity has been a part of the bitcoin environment since 2014. ( http://organofcorti.blogspot.com/2014/11/daily-and-weekly-bitcoin-transaction.html ) It's interesting that the author speculates on a cause for the daily cyclicality that would seem to conflict with the understanding that the source of the vast majority of bitcoin transactions is China.

Edit: I find this particularly strange because on March 11th I reported upon a Russian crackdown on the use of Bitcoin. ( http://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/170134 ) Why would there be such Russian interest in Bitcoin, sufficient to drive Blockchain to modify their data presentation to accommodate the Russian language, if the use of Bitcoin in Russia is a crime? Edit/Update: Checking back approximately three hours later, I see that the labels have been returned to English. An odd occurrence. I also note that the label language may be selected via a drop down menu. It is possibly that I inadvertently activated the Russian selection in this manner, but I do not believe I did so. Edit#2: So it seems the graph opens on a random language (this time Italian).

The decentralized nature of Bitcoin means that ultimately, the adoption of the new protocol upgrade will depend on the miner\u2019s rate of adoption. . . .  \"Fortunately, this upgrade is considered as a soft-fork, so there is no real risk for the network, and a new chain of transactions will not be produced. The upgraded clients will speed up the Blockchain, allowing for more transactions to happen every 10 minutes, old miners or nodes will remain fully functional and will coexist with their upgraded peers.

The fights have slowed down Bitcoin transactions and led some people to look for alternative virtual currencies to power their businesses. Enter Ethereum. \"Like Bitcoin, the Ethereum system is built on a blockchain in which every transaction is recorded publicly. The promise of such a system is that it allows the exchange of money and assets more quickly and more cheaply than relying on a long chain of middlemen. But Ethereum has also won fans with its promise to do much more than Bitcoin. In addition to the virtual currency, the software provides a way to create online markets and programmable transactions known as smart contracts.\n. . . .\n\"All of this work is still very early. The first full public version of the Ethereum software was recently released, and the system could face some of the same technical and legal problems that have tarnished Bitcoin. \"Many Bitcoin advocates say Ethereum will face more security problems than Bitcoin because of the greater complexity of the software. Thus far, Ethereum has faced much less testing, and many fewer attacks, than Bitcoin. The novel design of Ethereum may also invite intense scrutiny by authorities given that potentially fraudulent contracts, like the Ponzi schemes, can be written directly into the Ethereum system. \"But the sophisticated capabilities of the system have made it fascinating to some executives in corporate America. IBM said last year that it was experimenting with Ethereum as a way to control real world objects in the so-called Internet of things. Microsoft has been working on several projects that make it easier to use Ethereum on its computing cloud, Azure. \u201cEthereum is a general platform where you can solve problems in many industries using a fairly elegant solution \u2014 the most elegant solution we have seen to date,\u201d said Marley Gray, a director of business development and strategy at Microsoft. \"Mr. Gray is responsible for Microsoft\u2019s work with blockchains, the database concept that Bitcoin introduced. Blockchains are designed to store transactions and data without requiring any central authority or repository. Blockchain ledgers are generally maintained and updated by networks of computers working together \u2014 somewhat similar to the way that Wikipedia is updated and maintained by all its users.\n. .. \n\". . .  JPMorgan. . .  has created a specific tool, Masala, that allows some of its internal databases to interact with an Ethereum blockchain.\n. . . \n\"Since Bitcoin was invented, there have been many so-called alt-coins that have tried to improve on Bitcoin, but none have won the following of Ethereum.\n. . .\n\"Like Bitcoin, Ethereum has succeeded by attracting a dedicated network of followers who have helped support the software, partly in the hope that their Ether will increase in value if the system succeeds. Last week, there were 5,800 computers \u2014 or nodes \u2014 helping support the network around the world. The Bitcoin network had about 7,400 nodes.\n. . . \n\u201cBitcoin presented the broad strokes vision, and Ethereum presented the crystallization of how to deliver that vision,\u201d he said.\n. . . \n\u201cBitcoin is still probably the safest bet, but Ethereum is certainly No. 2, and some folks will say it is more likely to be around in 10 years,\u201d Mr. Bonneau said. \u201cIt will depend if any real markets develop around it.

As a matter of fact, as of March 2016 Bitcoin transactions have been on a decline compared to a peak of 265,000 transactions on February 28 because people may be realizing the risk of their transactions based on knowledge of the technical limitation that the system cannot take more than 250,000, which will motivate them to trade less when the system is near capacity due to longer transaction times.\n"], [15047, "2016-03-25T19:54:41Z", [0.75, 0.0, 0.25], ""], [16933, "2016-03-25T16:55:59Z", [0.18, 0.01, 0.81], ""], [691, "2016-03-25T12:30:10Z", [0.33, 0.0, 0.67], ""], [3363, "2016-03-25T12:20:13Z", [0.35, 0.09, 0.56], ""], [21046, "2016-03-25T11:35:36Z", [0.7, 0.0, 0.3], ""], [14432, "2016-03-25T01:49:24Z", [0.54, 0.0, 0.46], ""], [102, "2016-03-25T01:03:43Z", [0.36, 0.13, 0.51], "https://larswericson.wordpress.com/2016/03/25/gitrep-24mar16pm/"], [961, "2016-03-25T00:25:35Z", [0.19, 0.0, 0.81], ""], [691, "2016-03-24T19:38:49Z", [0.34, 0.0, 0.66], ""], [22882, "2016-03-24T14:09:00Z", [0.1, 0.0, 0.9], ""], [136, "2016-03-24T11:32:56Z", [0.25, 0.05, 0.7], ""], [20082, "2016-03-24T09:50:53Z", [0.05, 0.0, 0.95], ""], [14656, "2016-03-24T01:27:45Z", [0.45, 0.0, 0.55], ""], [821, "2016-03-23T22:41:14Z", [0.2, 0.02, 0.78], ""], [691, "2016-03-23T19:01:34Z", [0.35, 0.0, 0.65], ""], [12302, "2016-03-23T18:42:17Z", [0.3, 0.0, 0.7], ""], [10916, "2016-03-23T18:05:21Z", [0.2, 0.02, 0.78], ""], [12874, "2016-03-23T17:00:44Z", [0.22, 0.02, 0.76], ""], [14777, "2016-03-23T15:21:05Z", [0.2, 0.01, 0.79], ""], [11849, "2016-03-23T14:06:09Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [689, "2016-03-23T14:00:12Z", [0.27, 0.01, 0.72], ""], [11849, "2016-03-23T13:33:23Z", [0.15, 0.0, 0.85], ""], [20692, "2016-03-23T12:56:53Z", [0.26, 0.02, 0.72], ""], [15186, "2016-03-23T04:46:40Z", [0.1, 0.0, 0.9], ""], [21046, "2016-03-23T03:11:30Z", [0.75, 0.0, 0.25], ""], [627, "2016-03-23T00:02:01Z", [0.25, 0.05, 0.7], ""], [11885, "2016-03-22T19:30:34Z", [0.05, 0.0, 0.95], ""], [20443, "2016-03-22T18:44:26Z", [0.11, 0.0, 0.89], ""], [128, "2016-03-22T17:14:13Z", [0.4, 0.05, 0.55], ""], [13942, "2016-03-22T14:18:51Z", [0.8, 0.01, 0.19], ""], [691, "2016-03-22T12:40:48Z", [0.37, 0.0, 0.63], ""], [627, "2016-03-22T00:57:05Z", [0.25, 0.1, 0.65], "Changing my forecast for the time being,"], [20443, "2016-03-21T20:01:46Z", [0.07, 0.0, 0.93], "No 7-day period has eclipsed 250,000 as of yet.

(I haven't cross-validated, because I wanted to find out the implications of that fit, which matches my intuitive sense of the continuation of the trend.) The probabilities given the model forecast are calculated from a bootstrap simulation using the residuals of the last 90 days (the volatility of the residuals.). I moved to this model from a more Black & Scholes approach to capture the evident trend in the data, and then added the error to calculate the probabilities.  The trend looks to be accelerating to the upside, so there is always the danger of a crash from a bubble formation.  I also fitted a quadratic equation, but that failed to capture the recent upward acceleration. It might be more reasonable if the behavior was to return to its longer term trend.  I was heartened that the cubic model was only somewhat more generous to the upside than the Black & Scholes random walk model because it includes the trend, which the B&S model did not.

A brief incursion into 250K territory is not sufficient? I'm going to organize my guesses based on the actions of the Fed's FOMC moves and their consequent effects on the US dollar.  There are meetings on March 15-16 and April 26-27 before the question closes and there is the June 14-15 meeting after close.  I'm putting all my eggs in one basket on the assumption that the majority of volume is US-based. With BOJ's announcement of NIRP along with the same ongoing efforts by European entities, the likelihood is good that the movement on the US end will not continue to diverge so we may see rates remaining flat or decreasing.  To the magnitude of correction, whether flat or going negative, depends on whether we are seeing signs of deflation.   What effect will a response have on the dollar and possibly on bitcoin?  On December 16, 2016, the Feds raised the overnight rate a quarter percentage point.  The anticipated action was priced into the markets and presumably also into the bitcoin realm.  We saw a steady runup in volume before the FOMC decision and shortly thereafter.  Volume appeared to moderate around December 16 or so until about December 25.  The change in volume at Christmas was also reflected in price at that time.  Although the system can be gamed, you can't go against the fundamentals if (or even if) the volume is largely due to speculative activity. Obviously, finance and economics are not my area.  I'm trying not to overcomplicate my understanding of the relationships between things, rather I'm trying to see a broader pattern.  I just think that looking at the extrapolation of a curve is the wrong approach.  That seems rather too deterministic, relying on certain assumptions holding.  One has to understand the broad governing factors, if possible.

Personally, I find his narrative compelling, mostly because he doesn't sound crazy, though clearly other people involved would tell the tale differently. 2. The fundamental problem is lack of space on the blockchain, which hampers the ability to conduct transactions. There is a technical fix to this problem, but there does not seem to be the political will to implement this fix, for various reasons. (I find Mike's explanation about the involvement of the great firewall of China to be particularly interesting.) 3. Leaving out my own personal feelings about Bitcoin to the best of my ability, here are my predictions: a. The political deadlock will continue past June, exacerbated by a tailspin in the value of bitcoin. Essentially bitcoin is being run by people who have a strong distrust of institutions and political arrangements, and those are exactly what is needed right now to implement a technical solution to the blockchain problem. This will probably limit the number of transactions to below 250K.  b. As the political crisis continues, Bitcoin's value will tank, though probably not to zero before June, just because there are number of true believers who will maintain demand for the currency. However, declines in value create volatility, which creates a need for transactions, so I think that the level of transactions may actually stay relatively high even as the value plummets. this will probably keep the average above 125K.

The fundamentals are broken and whatever happens to the price in the short term, the long term trend should probably be downwards. I will no longer be taking part in Bitcoin development and have sold all my coins.\nWhy has Bitcoin failed? It has failed because the community has failed. What was meant to be a new, decentralised form of money that lacked \u201csystemically important institutions\u201d and \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d has become something even worse: a system completely controlled by just a handful of people.

The judge denied Fourth Corner Credit Union access to the country\u2019s financial system saying that cannabis still remained illegal under federal law. The credit union, authorized by Colorado in 2014, does not have permission to take deposits or issue credit, forcing most marijuana businesses to operate on a cash-only basis, raising robbery concerns. Colorado legalized recreational marijuana in 2012. U.S. District Judge R. Brooke Jackson said Tuesday that the U.S. Department of Justice noted Congress' concern over marijuana, adding that financial organizations that deal with money generated by the cannabis industry could be breaking the law, the Associated Press reported.

A temporary spike of 21.7% above this expected value would be required to exceed 250k.  Excluding the December 2015 spike (which I think can be attributed directly to holiday gift-giving), there have been 14 days out of the last 530 (the period which my curve fits best) that exceeded this threshold.  This suggests a 2.5% chance to exceed 250k on 6/7.  My confidence is weakened by the impending reduction in the block reward, expected in August.  It seems plausible that speculative trading in the lead-up to that event could cause a surge in volume, but I have no idea how large such an effect might be.  If it caused a 10% increase in volume, then an 11.7% spike in the normal volume would be enough to hit 250k, and 8% of the last 530 days exhibit such a spike.  I have no idea how reasonable an estimate 10% is for the effect of a possible speculation boom a month before an anticipated event.  It feels a little extreme to me, but I'm not confident in that assessment, so I'll go with that 8% for 250+.  On second thought, there was a smaller spike during the first week of June 2015, so I'll bump it up to 9% on the chance that that spike was due in part to some annually repeating event. I'm leaving my forecast for <125 at 3%, because the volume has been quite volatile since crossing the 125k threshold in September.  I expect to reduce this, possibly to 0%, if the recent upward trend continues with less volatility in the coming weeks. Edit:  All of the above ignores technical limitations and the question of whether the Bitcoin network will have the capacity to execute 250k transactions per day.  For that question, the following may be helpful. Without a change in block size, the primary limiting factor is average transaction size, graphed here: https://tradeblock.com/bitcoin/historical/1d-f-tsize_per_avg-01101.  Going by the mean transaction size for (roughly) 2015 of 574 bytes per tx, the maximum throughput is 250,846 tpd.  Perturbating factors include fluctuations in average transaction size, and number of miners refusing to fill up the block (presumably influenced by transaction fees, which are bound to rise when demand for transactions starts to outpace throughput). One proposal to increase block size, BIP 101, is not looking likely to succeed, as seen here: http://xtnodes.com/xt_blocks_alldata.php.  The blockchain will be forked two weeks after that graph reaches 750, but in the six months since its creation, it has not yet exceeded 8. Another proposal is known as \"BIP 100\", though it does not yet have an official BIP designation.  This would give miners the ability to vote on the maximum block size going forward.  Combined with the fact that it is miners who effectively vote on BIP adoption, this proposal may be more likely to succeed.  I've done no research on when this proposal might be implemented, much less adopted."], [1972, "2016-01-04T23:42:30Z", [0.33, 0.02, 0.65], ""], [1972, "2016-01-04T23:39:18Z", [0.27, 0.03, 0.7], ""], [14624, "2016-01-04T21:14:04Z", [0.49, 0.05, 0.46], ""], [691, "2016-01-04T19:21:33Z", [0.42, 0.02, 0.56], ""], [14597, "2016-01-04T19:12:01Z", [0.58, 0.02, 0.4], ""], [13726, "2016-01-04T18:40:31Z", [0.55, 0.05, 0.4], ""], [13726, "2016-01-04T18:40:10Z", [0.5, 0.1, 0.4], ""], [11916, "2016-01-04T18:06:55Z", [0.9, 0.0, 0.1], ""], [498, "2016-01-04T18:04:52Z", [0.44, 0.0, 0.56], ""], [14603, "2016-01-04T17:16:26Z", [0.35, 0.1, 0.55], ""], [14600, "2016-01-04T17:16:10Z", [0.75, 0.02, 0.23], ""], [1019, "2016-01-04T16:07:40Z", [0.65, 0.0, 0.35], ""], [6701, "2016-01-04T15:27:14Z", [0.5, 0.2, 0.3], ""], [11057, "2016-01-04T14:57:43Z", [0.41, 0.0, 0.59], "\"The semi-anonymous nature of the digital currency bitcoin makes it an attractive method of extorting funds from companies and individuals.

(It should have collapsed with out gold backing) and exists because now we have the world putting its faith in OUR WORD not our gold. According to the printing on physical bills - we in turn - place our faith in God. Yeah I know. Anyway - some links for you -  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKOTQCpJGUs  - this one picks on China in Particular.\nBy \"agreeing\" to have its currency used as a reserve currency, a country pins its hands behind its back. In order to keep the global economy chugging along, it may have to inject large amounts of currency into circulation, driving up inflation at home. The more popular the reserve currency is relative to other currencies, the higher its exchange rate and the less competitive domestic exporting industries become. This causes a trade deficit for the currency-issuing country, but makes the world happy. If the reserve currency country instead decides to focus on domestic monetary policy by not issuing more currency then the world is unhappy.\nBecoming a reserve currency presents countries with a paradox. They want the \"interest-free\" loan generated by selling currency to foreign governments, and the ability to raise capital quickly, because of high demand for reserve currency-denominated bonds. At the same time they want to be able to use capital and monetary policy to ensure that domestic industries are competitive in the world market, and to make sure that the domestic economy is healthy and not running large trade deficits. Unfortunately, both of these ideas \u2013 cheap sources of capital and positive trade balances \u2013 can't really happen at the same time.  This is the Triffin dilemma - http://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/1011/how-the-triffin-dilemma-affects-currencies.aspx\nWith respect to China - There is another possibility for reducing the pressures countries face trying to maintain reserve currency status: a new international monetary system. This isn't a new idea, having been floated for several decades as a potential solution. One possibility is the special drawing right, type of reserve asset maintained by a global institution, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF). While this is not a currency, it does represent a claim by other countries on foreign exchange assets. NOTE - BitCoin - is not issued by a nation and buying and selling them is a voluntary transaction, yet it is fact puts a claim on the worlds Basket of Currencies. Therefore adopting it or allowing it if you prefer takes some pressure of reserve currency nations and is a step toward a \"World Currency\" much as Gold is/was except it is available for use by individuals, BUT without a World Central Bank to regulate it - (Sorry Keynesians).\nThis is where the dark side (Yes I am going to beat Star War References to death)comes in - IF you hope to replace the worlds reserve currency of choice with your own - Bit Coin offers a back-up while the markets shake out. incessant foreign demand for a reserve currency would force its issuing country to run persistent current account deficits. [1]\nA reserve currency is a foreign currency that is traditionally held in countries\u2019 official reserves because of its global importance as a medium of exchange and its inherent stability.\nThe reserve-currency country enjoys the consumption benefit of running a trade deficit, while the rest of the world benefits from the additional liquidity, which helps facilitate trade.\nThe cost comes from the declining value and credibility of any currency which runs a persistent trade deficit - eventually leading to a reluctance of creditors to hold the reserve currency. [2]\nExample\nAs Francis Warnock (professor at the University of Virginia's Darden School of Business) points out in a paper for the Council On Foreign Relations, in 2010, the US confronted a dilemma first identified in 1960 by the Belgian-born Yale economist Robert Triffin.\nTo supply the world\u2019s risk-free asset, the country at the heart of the international monetary system has to run a current account deficit. In doing so, it becomes more indebted to foreigners until the risk-free asset ceases to be risk-free. http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=Triffin-dilemma pecifically, the Triffin dilemma is usually cited to articulate the problems with the role of the U.S. dollar as the reserve currency under the Bretton Woods system. John Maynard Keynes had anticipated this difficulty and had advocated the use of a global reserve currency called 'Bancor'. Currently the IMF's SDRs are the closest thing to the proposed Bancor but they have not been adopted widely enough to replace the dollar as the global reserve currency. In the wake of the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008, the governor of the People's Bank of China explicitly named the reserve currency status of the US dollar as a contributing factor to global savings and investment imbalances that led to the crisis. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triffin_dilemma One could argue that BitCoin is simply a sophisticated barter system and backed only by peoples belief in it."], [498, "2015-12-30T22:23:18Z", [0.35, 0.0, 0.65], "LOL.

Certainly, there are interpretative statements in that paper that deserve discussion.  One of the goals stated by the authors is identification of general patterns of usage.  Their analysis of the overall statistics allows an estimation of \u201cthe proportion of demand that is driven by payment motives compared with the proportion that is driven by investment motives.\u201d For example, the authors state that \u201cless than 50 percent of all bitcoins in circulation are used in transactions\u201d and \u201cabout half of these transactions are small value\u201d. They then point to online gambling as the driver of these transactions.  The authors also give no explanation for the relatively small number of large value transactions other than to state that these transactions are not likely to involve retail payments.  So I suppose one relevant question is whether you agree with their analysis concerning usage patterns.  Based on my scant knowledge of the subject matter, I'd be inclined to accept their conclusions, however, I'd like to see opposing views. Also, they examine the trend shown in the bitcoin exchange market.

He decides to pay 50 gold pieces a day to hire soldiers to protect his castle and the peasants. Since he does not have unlimited wealth, the plan is to cut the subsidy by half every four years.\nSo starting year five, he will only pay 25 gold pieces a day.\nAfter about 100 years, he will no longer pay any subsidy for the soldiers. The idea is that the peasants will start to appreciate living in this secure castle and that they will be willing to eventually pay for these soldiers. Satoshi Castle's security is so good that a lot of peasants from other castles have started to move to Satoshi Castle.\nKing Satoshi is a very welcoming king and lets everyone in. Everything is well and good until one day the castle started to get crowded and can no longer fit all the peasants that want in.\nWhat is King Satoshi to do? He can: Expand the size of the castle and welcome everyone.\nStart charging taxes on the peasants to pay for the soldiers. The tax will make it so that poor peasants can\u2019t afford to live in Satoshi Castle.\nOf course, none of the peasants want to start paying taxes. They want Satoshi Castle to stay being the utopia that it was. So, the vocal majority is in support of expanding the castle boundaries.\nIgnoring his own unease, Satoshi decided to listen to the peasants and to double the size of the castle every two years.\nAs time went on, the problem starts to become apparent. As the castle gets larger, more powerful soldiers are needed to protect the castle if they want to maintain the same level of security.\nAs King Satoshi's subsidy started to decrease, some level of taxation became inevitable. But the poor peasants can only afford very little, and rich peasants weren't willing to pay more than the poor ones. Not being paid enough, soldiers start to quit. This left the castle vulnerable to attacks. One day, soldiers from Yellen Castle came and stormed Satoshi Castle and destroyed it. As you can see from this analogy, increasing the block size limit (castle size) instead of increasing taxes (transaction fees) will result in soldiers (miners) quitting and a decrease in security.\nhttp://www.coindesk.com/eating-the-bitcoin-cake/?utm_source=CoinDesk+subscribers&utm_campaign=9978089aca-EMAIL_RSS_CAMPAIGNT2&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_74abb9e6ab-9978089aca-79221965"], [13923, "2015-12-27T16:50:34Z", [0.64, 0.01, 0.35], "Based on simple stochastic model on logarithmized transactions in the past."], [1333, "2015-12-27T15:47:14Z", [0.5, 0.1, 0.4], "Do you know what gluten is, what it does?

The price of Bitcoin has been rising faster on Chinese exchanges than elsewhere in the world. \"Bobby Lee, the chief executive of one of China\u2019s biggest Bitcoin exchanges, BTCC, said that, as was the case in past price spikes, a critical mass of reports on Bitcoin was drawing a new wave of speculators, betting more on the future of the virtual currency than on its current use. \u201cThere are a few tipping points in a row, and you get a tidal wave,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cIt\u2019s classic bull market.\u201d\n. . . \n\"All along there has been skepticism when investor interest in Bitcoin has raced ahead of the real-world use of the virtual currency. While Bitcoin has been described as a faster and cheaper way to send money online, ordinary people have been slow to use the virtual currency for everyday transactions and there are no major signs that is changing. But the companies that currently handle most Bitcoin transactions seem to be far stronger than those that did in the past.\n. . . . On Wednesday, Coinbase reported trading volume four times as high as its recent average. \"So far, big banks have not traded Bitcoin on these exchanges or invested in the virtual currency directly. But financial firms of all sorts have shown significant interest in the decentralized way in which Bitcoin transactions are handled and the new type of ledger on which all Bitcoins and Bitcoin transactions are recorded, known as the blockchain. \"Last week, Nasdaq introduced a new system, Linq, that will allow shares in start-ups to be recorded and traded on a ledger like the blockchain, which is expected to manage trades more quickly than existing systems. Over a dozen banks, including most of the global giants, have recently joined with a start-up, R3 CEV, to define standards for new decentralized ledgers. 'Most financial firms insist that they want to use blockchains that are not tied to Bitcoin. But financial firms have also been making bets in Bitcoin-related companies like the Digital Currency Group, a trading and investment company that announced funding from MasterCard and CIBC last week.\n. . . \n\"Investors have also been comforted by decisions like one last month by the European Union, which said that basic Bitcoin transactions would not be taxed, but would instead be treated like currency transactions. \"But as was the case during the big Bitcoin run-up in late 2013, most of the trading activity now is taking place in China. Exchanges there have encouraged speculation in Bitcoin by offering free trading and leveraged accounts. \"There has been discussion recently that some Chinese investors are seeking out Bitcoin as China\u2019s currency, the renminbi, has struggled and the government has made it harder to move money out of the country.\nMr. Lee of BTCC said he was not seeing much of those sorts of transactions. But he said he had seen signs that Chinese investors were using Bitcoin to move money into an international investment scheme, MMM Global, which claims to have been created by a man who did prison time in Russia after a previous Ponzi scheme collapsed. \"Bitcoin also continues to be used for illegal purposes. After the Silk Road online drug bazaar was taken down, imitators quickly popped up to take its place. \"Bitcoin has also become the currency of choice for online ransom payments because Bitcoin addresses can be created without providing any personal information. The Cyber Threat Alliance released a report last week estimating that hackers had collected $325 million from CryptoWall, a virus that can freeze a computer\u2019s files until an electronic ransom payment is made. \"Exchange operators, though, say that the new users rushing in in recent weeks have been making a bet that Bitcoin will go mainstream and rise in value as it does.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  All of this seems positive for increasing volume rates.

Using a simple linear and exponential growth trends from the start of the records (early 2009), both trends project ~1M transactions/day in early June 2016, which is obviously way beyond the projected bands.

[1]  Australian banks are closing accounts of bitcoin exchanges...[2] 2) Fraud/corruption/theft - if Bitcoin transactions come to be seen as not sufficiently safe then that will lower usage, (eg BitPay article in Tech Review pointed out by Raisinville [3]) 3) Financial market instability -  maybe financial system instability could result in increase in transactions. Read several articles last year about Venezuelans turning to bitcoin to deal with currency issues. [4] 4) \"Flood attacks\" - the transaction spike this summer was due to a \"flood attack\" apparently.  Basically in response to discussions internally in the Bitcoin community about block size, some players generated large numbers of transactions to basically gum up the works for those opposed to increasing block size.  (If I understand correctly!) [5]  Presence/absence of one of those attacks is going to be difficult to predict, especially this far out. Right now, seems like maybe the major use cases for bitcoin are on-line gambling and dealing with financial instability? I know NH has something up in legislature to make it legal to pay taxes in bitcoin, but that is likely to be tabled for this year.

Bear in mind that a big chunk of gambling activity comes from Asia, so we're talking about international sporting events, of which I have little knowledge.\n- Crackdowns in various countries can cause temporary dips in activity; watch major economies for this.\n- Problems with BTC exchanges (read: fraud) have caused overall dips in usage for extended periods of times, on several occasions in the past. This *might* be a lower risk now, as there is less reliance on a small number of large exchanges, and because there is more regulation in place.\n- Ownership changes of large gambling sites; SatoshiDice has changed ownership in the past (they account for a chunk of the transaction rate), as have other large gambling sites. New owners may increase their marketing budget, which may temporarily cause a spike in transactions; alternatively they may mismanage sites, resulting in an overall dip."], [83, "2015-09-29T18:34:51Z", [0.13, 0.02, 0.85], "Following group forecast."], [691, "2015-09-29T18:13:48Z", [0.06, 0.02, 0.92], ""], [212, "2015-09-29T16:24:50Z", [0.15, 0.05, 0.8], "The transaction number is pretty volatile, but it does look pretty likely that it's going to be between 125 and 250.  \"Bitcoin is to banking what the Internet was to telephony.\"\nhttp://e27.co/why-bitcoins-success-story-has-only-just-begun-20150824/"], [505, "2015-09-29T15:47:57Z", [0.6, 0.0, 0.4], ""], [3232, "2015-09-29T12:18:26Z", [0.12, 0.85, 0.03], ""], [136, "2015-09-29T08:34:10Z", [0.4, 0.05, 0.55], ""], [38, "2015-09-29T04:18:45Z", [0.6, 0.0, 0.4], "a straight-line increase would bring it to about 173,000 but a techie friend says 250,000+"], [366, "2015-09-29T02:32:40Z", [0.35, 0.05, 0.6], ""], [1993, "2015-09-29T01:12:39Z", [0.0, 0.5, 0.5], "I think it will hover around 125,000 transactions per day."], [498, "2015-09-28T22:22:39Z", [0.09, 0.01, 0.9], "Can anyone explain the abnormal volume around 21-Sept?
