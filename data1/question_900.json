If moderates don't show, McCaskill might be slightly more likely to take it.  But I suspect more moderates than usual will go to the polls and, if for no other reason, vote conservative out of habit, though there's much more evidence to show they'll vote party to keep Republicans in the majority.  If they aren't sure now that they're leaning toward McCaskill (and many seem not to be), I very much doubt that another month will do a lot to shift things.  And for registered likely voters, they lean conservative and may have mixed feelings about Hawley but are very clear in general about what they like and don't like about McCaskill.  She doesn't have much room to move and she'll only win if Hawley or Trump turn people off more than has already happened.
