To answer this question I would want to know:\nHow many bilateral military exercises Saudi and Iran hold annually.  \nHow many exercises China holds annually.  \nHow many times has China held bilateral military exercises with either Saudi or Iran, and when? For China-Iran, it looks like the Chinese have transferred technology to the Iranians and provided high-level training on using the technology. The Chinese conducted naval exercises with the Iranians in 2014, and signed an agreement to continue cooperation. China has received a high-level Saudi naval delegation in the past and had a joint Sino-Saudi exercise in 2013.  So at least once in the past 3 years, China has had a joint-exercise with either Iran or Saudi Arabia.   China has conducted anti-piracy and freedom of navigation missions in the Middle East as well. My gut says that Saudi Arabia would not want to draw anger from the US and would not conduct a joint exercise with China but it looks like the Saudis may be recalibrating their relationships.  Also, the Saudis HAVE conducted naval exercises with the Chinese in the past.  Ywb and YwoSA shouldn't be 0 (I'm late to the party here but want to give either some chance of happening).  A China-Iran joint exercise is more likely.  Again, I'm late to the party and I have not seen reference to any planned exercises but I think Ywol is more likely than Ywb and YwoSA and less likely than No. Articles I'm reading:\nhttp://www.mei.edu/content/map/china%E2%80%99s-soft-military-presence-middle-east\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China%E2%80%93Iran_relations#Military\nhttp://english.chinamil.com.cn/news-channels/china-military-news/2015-10/16/content_6726039.htm\nhttp://www.mei.edu/content/map/gcc%E2%80%99s-new-affair-china\nhttp://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/17402/china-s-naval-diplomacy-balances-iran-with-saudi-Arabia\nhttp://www.mei.edu/content/map/china%E2%80%99s-soft-military-presence-middle-east\nhttp://www.algemeiner.com/2015/10/16/iranian-brass-tells-chinese-counterpart-that-america-is-common-enemy/#\nhttp://www.politico.eu/article/dont-write-off-saudi-arabia-diplomatic-charm-offensive-brussels-russia-iran/\nhttp://www.politico.eu/article/dont-write-off-saudi-arabia-diplomatic-charm-offensive-brussels-russia-iran/"], [1034, "2016-07-25T15:08:24Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [98, "2016-07-25T04:45:21Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [368, "2016-07-24T20:50:58Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [13377, "2016-07-24T19:52:53Z", [0.03, 0.0, 0.02, 0.95], ""], [1034, "2016-07-24T17:57:28Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [27746, "2016-07-24T17:23:47Z", [0.01, 0.0, 0.0, 0.99], ""], [691, "2016-07-24T12:17:39Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [27725, "2016-07-24T11:22:59Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [3225, "2016-07-24T00:12:21Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [3225, "2016-07-24T00:11:41Z", [0.01, 0.0, 0.01, 0.98], ""], [755, "2016-07-24T00:01:27Z", [0.05, 0.0, 0.05, 0.9], "Affirming forecast for the passage of time.\n"], [368, "2016-07-23T19:41:46Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [27612, "2016-07-23T13:15:20Z", [0.05, 0.0, 0.05, 0.9], ""], [691, "2016-07-23T12:58:00Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [506, "2016-07-23T10:08:54Z", [0.02, 0.0, 0.0, 0.98], ""], [506, "2016-07-23T10:08:35Z", [0.0, 0.02, 0.0, 0.98], ""], [498, "2016-07-23T06:58:51Z", [0.55, 0.05, 0.0, 0.4], "Like so many other questions, I regret getting into this one after I've had a day or so to more fully contemplate the structure and details.

It has keen interest in Iran\u2019s geostrategic location, bordering both the Caspian Sea and the Persian Gulf. The location enables China carry out the One Belt One Road agenda.\nIran stands as China\u2019s most important ally in the Persian Gulf, and China may find it difficult to deepen cooperation with Gulf Cooperation Council countries, given their positive ties with the United States. Iran on the other hand, due to historic ties with China and longstanding suspicion of the United States, remains a trustworthy ally for China. As noted by analyst Jeffry S Payne, \u201cthe overland Silk Road cannot effectively connect the east to the west without Iran as an integrated part.\u201d\nChina conducted joint naval exercises with Iran in 2014, and this may be a way to keep a check on growing naval cooperation between India and Iran \u2013 two countries that conducted joint naval exercises in 2003, 2006 and 2015.\nIran is also following in China\u2019s footsteps to create an anti-US anti-access area denial strategy, or A2/AD, to reduce US military supremacy in the Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean Sea. China undoubtedly expects Tehran to play an integral part in Beijing\u2019s string of pearls \u2013 building a string of naval facilities in the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean to counter American influence.\nMiddle East markets are essential for China\u2019s One Belt One Road program of building a network of manufacturing and transportation centers in Central Asia and Europe. Beijing also looks beyond Iran \u2013 establishing nuclear cooperation with Saudi Arabia and in the process of building a relationship with other GCC countries. This could lead to reducing tensions between rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran by providing economic opportunities through the One Belt One Road initiative.\nThis requires balance on the part of Beijing. In January, Xi traveled to the Middle East, visiting Riyadh as well as Tehran probably to assure both and discourage misinterpretations that China supports one country over the other.'

China has a long-standing policy of no foreign military bases and is going to great lengths to describe the facility as something less than a military base. Chinese observers call it, for example, a logistic hub for Chinese ships to obtain replenishment and temporary rest. Zhang Junshe, from the PLA Naval Military Studies Research Institute, said it is \u201cfar less than a military base in its scale and function\u201d (Global Times, March 15; China Brief, January 26). However, most non-Chinese observers believe this facility sounds more like a military base. When asked why China does not proclaim global conditions have changed and it now needs a military base, a Chinese think tank representative responded that \u201ccontinuity of Communist Party policy\u201d does not permit a break with the long-standing principle of no foreign military bases. \nChina\u2019s security policy in Africa is evolving slowly but inexorably toward greater engagement and a more robust physical presence. This is demonstrated in its global security policy changes, participation in the anti-piracy operation in the Gulf of Aden, gradual increase in numbers of personnel assigned to UN peacekeeping operations and the deployment of combat troops, greater attention to cooperation with African countries on counter-terrorism, and more frequent calls in African ports by the PLA Navy.

The theocratic nation consistently meddles in the affairs of its smaller Middle Eastern neighbors in operations ranging from supporting opposition movements to sending Iranian forces to fight in the on-going Syrian conflict. The only redeeming quality about Iran\u2019s Syrian venture is that is fighting against the same three evils (terrorism, extremism, and separatism) embodied in the Islamic State (ISIS) that the SCO is so steadfastly against. However, China and the SCO would risk having its security mission be exposed to hypocrisy should Iran continue its unilateral actions as a member. This could invite reprisals against SCO member states by the forces Iran is engaged against, linking their grievances to the larger organization. At worst, Iran could potentially pull the SCO into the Middle Eastern quagmire of conflicts in some yet unforeseeable way. China\u2019s military does not have the capability to operate at such operational distances even with substantial basing in the region and seeks to avoid being pulled too far west too quickly. \"Despite several large drawbacks, Iran would provide some excellent advantages for China and the PLA as it develops its own modern mission set and the corresponding capabilities. The pros include potential SCO maritime access to the volatile Middle East should they ever need it, and combat experienced forces for the regional anti-terrorism structure (RATS) mechanism as well as for the \u201cPeace Mission\u201d exercises. \"Iran would be the first SCO member with a maritime border in the core of the Middle East.  . . .  If Iran became a SCO member it could possibility provide the PLA with the pretext it needs to establish another overseas basing facility near/in the western Indian Ocean under a multinational organization, giving it much more international legitimacy than the Djibouti facility. This new facility could potentially be founded under the umbrella of the SCO as an anti-piracy and anti-maritime terrorism operation base. Anti-maritime terrorism exercises are already a precedent set by India and Russia in their fall 2015 naval exercise off the east coast of India that took place under similar scenario backdrop. By using the SCO as the primary operational mechanism for the facility, and throwing in some transparency, China further negates a large amount of the Indian paranoia that has come with its expansion into the Indian Ocean. \"Iran\u2019s experienced special and paramilitary forces would be an excellent addition to the RATS mechanism of the SCO. Iranian forces have experience in combating a large-scale, highly capable extremist organization (ISIS) as well as western-supported rebel groups. Such an experienced combat force would be able to provide a large amount of valuable information to their SCO comrades during future \u201cPeace Mission\u201d joint anti-terror exercises. After all, many \u201cPeace Mission\u201d exercises have been designed around the nightmare scenario of a Central Asian Syria-style catastrophe. China\u2019s military has not been involved in a conflict of any intensity since its short punitive war with Vietnam, and would not have institutionalized knowledge of how to conduct such a conflict in modern conditions. Realistic training across all services has consistently been the major impediment to creating a truly effective and modern military force for China, as well as the rest of the Central Asian SCO members. Training augmented by modern conflict information from Iran would greatly increase the PLA and SCO\u2019s capabilities for conflicts in Central Asia and even perhaps the Middle East in the distant future.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  I learned a lot from this piece which identifies the ways in which China might benefit from a closer relationship with Iran.

The paper outlined the strategy of \u201cactive defense,\u201d which is essentially an amalgamation of the concepts of offshore defense and open seas protection. The strategy maintains, \u201cThe traditional mentality that control of the land is more important than control of the sea must be abandoned, and great importance has to be attached to managing the seas and oceans and protecting maritime rights and interests.\u201d The ideas articulated in this strategy have already begun to crystallize; China\u2019s ships have progressively been operating away from their coasts over the years and they are going to continue to operate even further and for longer periods.\nHowever, in order to prove its mettle, China has to do more than just operate far from home; they must demonstrate significant operational capability. The Pentagon\u2019s 2015 report on China\u2019 s Military Power noted, \u201cWhereas \u2018near seas\u2019 defense remains the PLA Navy\u2019s primary focus, China\u2019s gradual shift to the \u2018far seas\u2019 has necessitated that its Navy support operational tasks outside the first island chain with multi-mission, long-range, sustainable naval platforms with robust self-defense capabilities.\u201d China has set out to do exactly that. Their naval fleet has provided an escort for over 6,000 commercial ships; their hospital ship Peace Ark has been frequently dispatched to provide healthcare to countries in need; and their warships are increasingly relied upon for real-world missions from counter-piracy to evacuations of Chinese citizens.\"\nSee also @Gonzo , April 17 post, links and most excellent commentary.

As for the first, now that piracy has slackened some in the Arabian Sea, there is less point to joint maneuvers there, and there is certainly no reason for either Iran or Saudi Arabia to paddle that far east.

The question is why, and the most obvious answer is to counter US military strength and promote strengthen diplomatic ties. That's probably a major factor favoring joint exercises with Iran or Saudi Arabia. However, I think there's two complications. First, the dynamics of the Middle East are shifting rapidly. Saudi Arabia finds itself in an increasingly unfriendly terrain while Iran's recent deal with the US is warming relations with the US. With a key US partner finding itself threatened and a former US adversary finding itself liberated PLUS the geopolitical quagmire which is ISIS in play, there's really not a lot of reason to be involved in the area just yet.

Saudi Arabia would be especially sensitive about such a move, as it already has objections to the assertive role played by one other major power, Russia, in the Syrian theatre. It would probably also view China as more partial to Iran, given China's past reluctance about sanctions efforts directed at Iran. Therefore, Saudi Arabia would read joint military exercises between China and Iran very negatively. China is likely to take this factor into consideration, which is why I have assigned only a 2% probability to an exercise only with Iran.  I assess that Iran would be less distraught by an exercise involving China and Saudi Arabia, as it is probably less insecure about its own relationship with China. In other words, Iran and China appear to already have a decent rapport given the rivalry China has with the USA.

Then there is the matter of two wars being fought in the Middle East: in Syria and Yemen. Iran is involved on the ground in Syria and Saudi Arabia in Yemen.

China's trade with Europe will soon be directly through Iran (by sea and rail), and Iran's oil and gas are key to China's future energy security. Iran itself presents many new investment opportunities that China sorely needs to help compensate for its slowing economy. Xi's recent trip to Iran was evidence of such. \nBut S.A. is still the dominant oil producer when it comes to supply and control over prices so China must balance relations and help to avoid a SA-Iran direct conflict. China doesn't want to create an even more tense situation and cause energy supplies from either Iran or S.A. to be disrupted or hampered enough to cause increased volatility in prices and supply.\nSo that leaves me with two choices for China here: either don't have exercises with either, or have exercises with both-. Having exercises with both would serve the additional purpose of further integrating the PLAN into the strait of Hormuz/ Gulf shipping lanes security and further asserting China's role in the middle east as regional / global power who can serve as an alternative to the US. Establishing the new PLAN base in Djibouti was the first step in this process.\nSo all in all I think China will have exercises with both or neither, and I'm leaning towards both, tempered by the dominance of \"No\" from other forecasters.\nhttp://www.inss.org.il/index.aspx?id=4538&articleid=11378\nhttp://globalriskinsights.com/2015/07/securing-the-sealanes-of-the-super-highway/\nhttp://www.thegulfintelligence.com/Docs.Viewer/2aeeb02d-e2d8-483a-9f43-98dddf8dc89d/default.aspx\nhttp://www.thegulfintelligence.com/Docs.Viewer/2aeeb02d-e2d8-483a-9f43-98dddf8dc89d/default.aspx"], [20227, "2016-02-19T05:22:47Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [20224, "2016-02-19T04:13:06Z", [0.5, 0.2, 0.0, 0.3], ""], [932, "2016-02-19T03:22:51Z", [0.02, 0.01, 0.02, 0.95], ""], [191, "2016-02-18T23:30:55Z", [0.15, 0.0, 0.0, 0.85], ""], [14033, "2016-02-18T22:55:06Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.0, 0.85], ""], [19170, "2016-02-18T21:47:14Z", [0.25, 0.1, 0.0, 0.65], ""], [15471, "2016-02-18T21:40:41Z", [0.5, 0.1, 0.05, 0.35], "Rather unlikely for no navel exercise to happen, given that PRC did one last year with Iran already.
