In this case, we just don't have the data to be able to do that.  So much depends on unknown (?unknowable) factors, like how keen Maduro is to have this election turn out in a particular way.  Sure, we can estimate that, but really we are each making an educated guess. That said, the election is scheduled for tomorrow, and I find it is highly unlikely it will be cancelled now, so:\nDECREASE the probability of \"No\". I remain my forecast (?guess) that Maduro and the PSUV are relatively more phlegmatic about the results of this election that your standard uncharismatic dictator.   Point 1:  The current results represent, in my estimation, a \"high tide\" for the PSUV.  In 2008 (PSUV won 18 governorships) and 2012 (20 governorships) we had the same \"dirty tricks\" by the PSUV, and the same ambivalence about participating from the opposition.  However, in both 2008 and 2012, the PSUV was at least maintaining a semblance of popularity compared to the opposition in polling, and had the half-way competent (so far as pseudo-dictators go) Chavez in charge.  Given their utterly woeful polling numbers now, the PSUV would need to double or treble down on their already-substantial electoral interference just to retain 18-20 governorships. Point 2:  Governorships are a low-stake game.  Given the various state legislatures (where the real power resides) will by-and-large continue to be controlled by the PSUV, opposition-controlled governorships have little practical implications for the government's control of the nation.  Compare this with the 2015 national election to the National Assembly, a body with significant legal authority.  Despite having exactly the same tools to pervert the result, and significantly more motivation to do so, the PSUV \"allowed\" (or were unable to prevent) an outcome where 56% of the electorate supported the opposition, and 2/3rds of the seats wound up controlled by the opposition.  Or compare the 2013 presidential election (a _very_ high stakes contest), where results basically reflected the polling, or even had the opposition candidate out-performing his polls. In short, why bother calling an election at all that will require you to resort to outright theft to maintain the status quo, in what is an essentially symbolic election, if you were not prepared to resort to outright theft to win more meaningful elections previously?  However all of this is leavened by the recurrent advice of longstanding forecasters: \"Never underestimate the probability that national leaders will make the most counter-intuitive and counter-productive decision possible\". So ... my median forecast: PSUV will continue to interfere with the electoral process to a degree consistent with previous Venezuelan national elections: fiddling at the edges, but not outright theft.  Given the woeful PSUV polls, this is likely to result in the PSUV losing governorships: anywhere from 3 to 15 depending on turnout, for a final result for the PSUV somewhere in the middle of 5-17 (call it 11). However, there is a significant residual chance of the PSUV \"going postal\" to maintain (or even improve on) their current situation. Last point, and it is almost trivial, but might make a difference: note that the clustering of results is not even.  That is:\nOption 1:  21, 22, 23 governorships\nOption 2:  15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 governorships\nOption 3:  11, 12, 13, 14 governorships\nOption 4:  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 governorships So option 3, which I am gravitating towards, has the narrowest \"landing zone\", which means it would take very little to push results into Option 2 or Option 4.

To this point I've been not really sure of how to find relevant data.  But with five 5 days left, I figured I should do a bit more than guess. So, looking at the past two electoral results (2008, 2012) across the 23 governorships, we find three rough groups:\na)  STRONGLY GOVERNMENT = 10 states.  That is, both 2008 and 2012 elections were won by government candidates, and one or both of those wins were by a large margin.\nb)  OPPOSITION PRIORITIES = 7 states.  That is, either currently held by the opposition, or else held by the opposition in 2008, and the opposition getting 45%+ of the vote in 2012.\nc)  SWING = 6 states.  That is, in neither of the above 2. Another data point: the excellent analysis found at http://www.diariolasamericas.com/america-latina/oposicion-puede-ganar-18-gobernaciones-si-derrota-la-abstencion-n4132460 (Google Translate does a pretty good job).  In short, despite lots of rage against the government, opposition turnout will determine the election result. At a high tide turnout, the government is safe in 5 states, but the opposition would be very competitive in the remaining 18 states.  At a low-end turnout, the government would be highly confident in 13 states, with the remaining 10 being less certain.  I am ambivalent about the turnout.  I think anger about the current situation will be countered somewhat by disappointment at the opposition's \"collaboration\" by participating in elections.  The turnout will be higher than in the last 2 elections, but nowhere near the \"high tide\" scenario. I think overt electoral interference by the government will be a minor factor only.  After all, Venezuela was just as much a populist one-man show in 2015, and the government \"allowed\" the opposition to win 109/167 seats in the National Assembly.  The state governorships are far less important/powerful.  Even if the opposition win many state governorships, 22 of the 23 state legislatures will remain in government control.  In short, I can't see the government massively \"cheating\" (leaving multiple dropped-out opposition candidates on the ballot papers notwithstanding), so the polling is likely to be fairly reflective of the official outcome. So making middle-of-the-road assumptions about turnout, that makes perhaps 10 states safe for the government, 5-7 safe for the opposition, and 6-8 that will be close.  Give half of those to the government, and that gives a median scenario of 13-14 states to the government.   So I have underestimated the probability of government winning 10-15 states."], [23234, "2017-10-09T20:52:27Z", [0.04, 0.46, 0.46, 0.04, 0.0], ""], [40561, "2017-10-09T09:02:43Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.1, 0.05, 0.75], "Short time Period.

Quick searches suggest that, in as much as Venezuelan elections are corrupt, the corruption is manifest through using the instruments of state to prevent elections, or intimidate particular candidates, or discourage the public from participating.  The actual balloting process, if biased, seems to be only subtly so.   For the government, losing a few state governorships is a low-threat situation.  Governors are much less powerful than the new Constituent Assembly, which the PSUV dominates.  They know the polls are running against them, and still chose to pull forward the state elections from December to October.  Can't see why they'd cancel now.
