in North Korea crisis Nebehay (2017) September 4, states that: Neutral Switzerland is prepared to act as a mediator to help resolve the North Korea crisis, including by hosting ministerial talks, Swiss President Doris Leuthard said on Monday. Leuthard said Swiss troops were deployed on the demarcation zone between South Korea and North Korea and noted that her country - along with Sweden - had a long history of neutral and discreet diplomacy. This has included Switzerland representing U.S. interests in both Iran and Cuba. But China and the United States had to take their share of responsibility, she added, warning against \u201cover-reactions\u201d after the North\u2019s sixth and largest nuclear test (para 1-3). \u201cI think it really is time for dialogue,\u201d she told a news conference in Berne. \u201cWe are ready to offer our role for good services as a mediator. I think in the upcoming weeks a lot will depend on how the U.S. and China can have an influence in this crisis. That\u2019s why I think Switzerland and Sweden can have a role behind the curtain\u201d (para. 5). Noting that the Communist Party congress in North Korea\u2019s neighbor and ally China was due to take place in October, Leuthard said the time for such initiatives was not ideal, so \u201cperhaps this was also part of the plan of North Korea\u201d (para. 8).

Mr. Kim\u2019s visit, the date of which wasn\u2019t disclosed by Pyongyang in its report on Wednesday, underscores North Korea\u2019s continued investment in its ability to threaten the continental U.S. with a nuclear-tipped long-range missile (para. 1-2). North Korea didn\u2019t test-fire any missiles between October and February, according to a database compiled by the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies. But after that relatively long hiatus, North Korea test-launched 14 missiles in a little more than five months, including two intercontinental ballistic missiles and other shorter-range missiles that demonstrated new capabilities (para.5). But Mr. Cronin argued that the U.S. should continue to pursue diplomacy with Pyongyang, and encourage any signs of progress\u2014including the recent dearth of missile tests (para. 12).\nNorth Korea hasn\u2019t launched a missile in 26 days, although the launch of its first ICBM on July 4 came after a 35-day pause.\n\u201cNorth Korea has shown glimmers of restraint for now and the U.S. seeks to encourage more, but is ready to move in the opposite direction as well,\u201d Mr. Cronin said (para. 12-14).

While the United States has maintained an uneasy calm with North Korea for more than six decades and spikes in tensions are not new, recent supercharged rhetoric between the unpredictable U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have heightened the risk of miscalculation that could make that nightmare a reality, they say. On Thursday, North Korea upped the ante by saying it would complete plans by mid-August to fire four intermediate-range missiles over Japan to land near the U.S. Pacific island territory of Guam, after Trump said that any threats by Pyongyang would be \"met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.\" The exchange followed a United Nations resolution tightening sanctions on North Korea after it tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles designed to carry nuclear warheads to the United States. Trump said on Thursday his fire and fury comment was not tough enough. Despite the war of words, for now the U.S. military says there has been no change in its readiness posture in South Korea or elsewhere in Asia.

aid providers and religious groups to have contact with North Koreans over inter-Korean exchanges. The Ministry of Unification said that it gave the green light to plans by two humanitarian aid providers and six religious groups to come in contact with North Korea as the government decided to revive civilian exchanges with the North. \"The approval came as the government will flexibly review civilian exchanges between the two Koreas to an extent that the move would not hamper the international sanctions regime,\" Lee Eugene, vice spokesperson at the ministry, told a regular press briefing. The groups receiving approval included agencies that seek to provide nutrition support and medication to North Korean children, the ministry added. The approval came after the United States on Thursday imposed more fresh sanctions against North Korea, blacklisting more entities and individuals suspected of supporting Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs. The ministry said last month that Seoul will sternly respond to the North's provocative acts, but also believes that long-strained inter-Korean ties will help stability on the peninsula. The move followed the ministry's first approval on May 26 for a bid by the Korean Sharing Movement to contact North Koreans since the inauguration of the Moon Jae-in administration in May. The civic group is seeking to send Malaria-fighting materials to North Korea in areas bordering the two Koreas. The ministry also granted a local group contact with North Koreans for a joint inter-Korean summit anniversary event slated for this month. The nongovernment group is hoping to visit North Korea to prepare for a joint event to mark the first inter-Korean summit on June 15, 2000. But the ministry cast a prudent stance over whether it will approve the group's visit, saying that it will take into account the event's purpose and other details first. \"Applications for trips to North Korea will be reviewed after Seoul takes into account their purpose, inter-Korean ties and the international environment,\" Park Soo-hyun, presidential office spokesman, told reporters on Thursday. If the joint event is approved, it would mark the first time such a celebration has been jointly held in nine years. In 2000, then-South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and his North Korean counterpart Kim Jong-il held a historic summit in Pyongyang, producing a landmark agreement on reconciliation and economic cooperation between the two rival Koreas. During the liberal administration of President Roh Moo-hyun in 2003-2008, civic groups held summit anniversary events in Seoul and Pyongyang. In October 2007, Roh held a summit with the North's leader. The group called on the government to fully approve civilian inter-Korean exchanges, including its joint summit event. \"The government should unveil measures for better inter-Korean ties and reconciliation if it seeks to honor the spirit of the two summits' agreements,\" the preparatory group said. It added that the North hopes to hold the event in Pyongyang, while the group proposed to do so in the North Korean border city of Kaesong. \"If Seoul approves our plan, we are considering sending a 100-member delegation to North Korea,\" it said. Any trip by South Koreans to North Korea requires the Seoul government's approval, as well as the North's consent.

Security Council response - such as sanctions - to North Korea's repeated ballistic missile launches, which the 15-member body normally condemns in a statement, diplomats said. It was not immediately clear how open Beijing might be to new sanctions. The council has traditionally boosted sanctions in response to North Korea's five nuclear tests and two long-range rocket launches. Sanctions were first imposed on Pyongyang in 2006. North Korea has in the past year stepped up its missile tests, firing dozens of various types of rockets, according to South Korea. The most recent test, which failed, came on Friday following a U.N. Security Council meeting on North Korea, chaired by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. \"The cumulative actions of the DPRK (North Korea) since their last nuclear test compel us to look at a range of measures that would apply pressure,\" said a spokesman for the U.S. Permanent Mission to the United Nations on Tuesday. \"As Secretary Tillerson said on Friday, business as usual is not an option. We are exploring options for a response to this series of provocations with our Security Council colleagues,\" the spokesman said. Tillerson on Friday urged the Security Council to act before North Korea does. The Trump administration has been aggressively pressing Beijing to rein in its ally and neighbor North Korea, warning that all options were on the table if Pyongyang persists with its nuclear and missile development. But China has said military threats would not help the situation and has accused the United States of fueling tensions on the Korean Peninsula. Beijing on Tuesday reiterated its opposition to the deployment of the U.S.' THAAD anti-missile defense system in South Korea and urged it to be halted immediately. The last round of complex sanctions imposed by the Security Council took three months to negotiate following Pyongyang's fifth nuclear test in September. Those measures aimed to cut North Korea's annual export revenue by a quarter. Traditionally, the United States and China have negotiated new sanctions before involving remaining council members. U.N. diplomats said the current talks were still just between the pair (para. 1-11). Nichols, M. (2017). U.S., China talk firmer U.N. response to North Korea's missiles: diplomats. Reuters.

Retrieved from \nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-nuclear-un-idUSKBN17Y2AG North Korea says U.S. bomber flights push peninsula to brink of nuclear war Park and Blanchard (2017) Tue May 2, states that: North Korea accused the United States on Tuesday of pushing the Korean peninsula to the brink of nuclear war after a pair of strategic U.S. bombers flew training drills with the South Korean and Japanese air forces in another show of strength. The two supersonic B-1B Lancer bombers were deployed amid rising tensions over North Korea's pursuit of its nuclear and missile programme in defiance of U.N. sanctions and pressure from the United States. The flight of the two bombers on Monday came as U.S. President Donald Trump said he would be \"honored\" to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in the right circumstances, and as his CIA director landed in South Korea for talks. South Korean Defence Ministry spokesman Moon Sang-gyun told a briefing in Seoul that Monday's joint drill was conducted to deter provocations by the North. North Korea said the bombers conducted \"a nuclear bomb dropping drill against major objects\" in its territory at a time when Trump and \"other U.S. warmongers are crying out for making a preemptive nuclear strike\" on the North. \"The reckless military provocation is pushing the situation on the Korean peninsula closer to the brink of nuclear war,\" the North's official KCNA news agency said on Tuesday. Tensions on the Korean peninsula have been high for weeks, driven by concerns that the North might conduct its sixth nuclear test in defiance of pressure from the United States and Pyongyang's sole major ally, China. The U.S. military's THAAD anti-missile defence system has reached initial operational capacity in South Korea, U.S. officials told Reuters, although they cautioned that it would not be fully operational for some months (para. 1-8).

different course\", U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Saturday, softening previous criticism of Beijing after talks with his Chinese counterpart. China has been irritated at being repeatedly told by Washington to rein in North Korea's surging nuclear and ballistic missile programme, one of a series of hurdles in ties between the world's two largest economies. But Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi described the talks with Tillerson as \"candid, pragmatic and productive\". The two sides appeared to have made some progress or put aside differences on difficult issues, at least in advance of a planned summit between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump. On Friday, Tillerson issued the Trump administration's starkest warning yet to North Korea, saying in Seoul that a military response would be \"on the table\" if Pyongyang took action to threaten South Korean and U.S. forces. Tillerson took a softer line after the meeting with Wang. He told reporters both China and the United States noted efforts over the last two decades had not succeeded in curbing the threat posed by North Korea's weapons programme (para. 1-5).

With the range of North Korea\u2019s missiles getting closer to North America, Tillerson is seeking a new approach as part of a trip to Japan, South Korea and China.\n\u201cLet me be very clear: this policy of strategic patience has ended,\u201d Tillerson said. \u201cAll options are on the table.

China\u2019s proposal on Wednesday for North Korea to suspend its nuclear and missile tests in exchange for a halt in U.S.-South Korean military exercises closely resembles previous offers from Pyongyang that were rejected by the Obama administration. Even so, China hopes the idea will gain fresh traction with President Donald Trump as he reviews policy options following North Korea\u2019s most recent missile tests and the killing in Malaysia of a half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The revival of the idea reflects China\u2019s growing concern about the deployment in South Korea this week of the first parts of a U.S. missile-defense system that Beijing says could be used to track Chinese nuclear missiles. After banning coal imports from North Korea last month, China is reluctant to apply further economic pressure that could cause the regime to collapse and potentially bring U.S. troops closer to the Chinese border, analysts and diplomats say. Instead, the Chinese leadership is presenting itself as an intermediary while trying to place the burden of responsibility on the U.S. for making the next move.

The Korean Institute for National Unification, a state-backed think tank, has tallied up dozens of reported cases of suspected retaliation.\nChina hasn\u2019t confirmed any reprisals but has at times belied a link between its actions and South Korea\u2019s planned deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or Thaad. The two nations\u2019 foreign ministers traded barbs over Thaad this past weekend at a security conference in Munich.\nMeanwhile, China\u2019s official Xinhua news agency, in an English-language commentary, warned the South Korean conglomerate Lotte Group on Sunday that it was \u201cplaying with fire\u201d over its plan to allow Seoul to deploy Thaad on its land.\nThe dispute adds a new wrinkle to Northeast Asia\u2019s complex network of alliances and antipathies as Pyongyang moves closer to its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile that can reach the continental U.S. Last week, it launched another missile test that experts say advanced that goal. The killing last week of North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un\u2019s half brother in a Malaysian airport added to Mr. Kim\u2019s reputation for ruthlessness and unpredictability, sparking new fears in South Korea. Officials in Seoul hold Mr. Kim responsible.\nSeoul recently launched a task force to hear complaints from South Korean businesses operating in China and discuss possible countermeasures to Beijing\u2019s alleged retaliation over Thaad. Some lawmakers have called for a formal complaint at the World Trade Organization.\n\u201cWe will keep raising the issue with the China side resolutely and continuously, while judging facts objectively and responding reasonably,\u201d said Korean Vice Trade Minister Woo Tae-hee recently (para. 1-7).

Security Council's five veto powers are close to approving new sanctions on North Korea to cut the isolated state's earnings from exports by more than a quarter, principally by targeting its coal exports to China, diplomats said on Friday.\nThe U.S.-drafted resolution, in response to North Korea's fifth nuclear test in September, would set a U.N. cap on North Korean coal exports with the aim of cutting hard currency revenues by at least $700 million.\nThe resolution would also restrict North Korea's maritime and financial sectors. If successful, it could cut the country's $3 billion in annual export earnings by at least $800 million, U.N. Security Council diplomats said.\nThe restrictions on coal would bar exports connected to individuals involved in North Korea's weapons programs, said the diplomats, who did want to be identified as discussions were still under way. The new resolution would also target other North Koreans individuals and entities, they said.\nDiplomats said on Wednesday that the United States and China had agreed on new U.N. sanctions to impose on North Korea, but Russia was delaying action on a draft resolution.\nA senior U.N.
