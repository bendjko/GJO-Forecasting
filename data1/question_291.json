All training missions were accomplished in one operation, it said.\nThe CCTV report quoted Cui Meng, head of one of the fleet's aviation brigades, as saying that \"the night flights are crucial for pilots to prepare for all-weather operation.\"\nCui also said that \"the training simulated actual combat conditions and took full advantage of the South China Sea line, a complicated battle environment.\"\nCompared with daytime flight missions, night missions are more challenging because of the lack of reference points, and nighttime lighting conditions can be confusing, Song Zhongping, a military expert who served in the Rocket Force, told the Global Times.\nThe broad South China Sea line features a bigger combat radius, so choosing such a training location showcases the navy's real-world combat mentality, he said.\nThe PLA navy needs to train its own pilots. It is based on the needs of naval missions, which likely include ship-based flight missions. For example, China's aircraft carriers will need more carrier-based pilots, which require different skills rather than training from a base, Song added.

The operation came as President Donald Trump's administration seeks Chinese cooperation in dealing with North Korea's missile and nuclear programs and could complicate efforts to secure a common stance. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the USS John S. McCain traveled close to Mischief Reef in the Spratly Islands, among a string of islets, reefs and shoals. China has territorial disputes with its neighbors over the area. It was the third \"freedom of navigation operation\" during Trump's presidency. Thursday's operation, first reported by Reuters, was the latest attempt to counter what Washington sees as Beijing's efforts to limit freedom of navigation in the strategic waters, and comes as Trump is seeking China's cooperation to rein in North Korea. China's Defense Ministry said two Chinese warships \"jumped into action\" and warned the U.S. ship to leave, labeling the move a \"provocation\" that seriously harms mutual trust. \"China is resolutely opposed to this kind of show of force and pushing of regional militarization by the U.S. that may easily cause an unexpected incident at sea or in the air,\" it said in a statement (para. 1-7).

The South China Sea has long been the most, thorny issue for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), with different opinions among its 10 members on how to address China's assertiveness and its building and heavy arming of its artificial islands in disputed waters. Philippine foreign ministry spokesman Robespierre Bolivar gave no reason for the delay and said the statement would instead be released at the end of a series of regional events hosted by Manila in the next few days. \"The communique will be issued together with all the chairman's statements by the end of all the meetings,\" he said. ASEAN's problem in agreeing the wording highlight China's growing influence at a time of uncertainty whether the new U.S. administration will priorities relations with ASEAN, and try to check Beijing's controversial maritime activities. Diplomats from three ASEAN countries said the delay was because Vietnam, which is among four members with competing sovereignty claims with China, wanted the text to mention the need to avoid land reclamation and militarization (para. 1-6). China is extremely sensitive about ASEAN mentioning its expansion of its military capabilities on those islands and some members are concerned about possible repercussions of upsetting Beijing given its military and economic power (para.8). Three of China's seven reclaimed reefs have runways several kilometers\u2019 long, radar, surface-to-air missiles and storage facilities for fighter jets. \"It's only Vietnam holding out. Maybe, by tomorrow everything will be ironed out,\" said one diplomat involved in the drafting process (para. 8-10). Mogato, M. (2017).

The Association of South East Asian Nations had not received any guarantees from China in discussions to create a framework for the code within this year, but ASEAN was hopeful a set of rules could be agreed to ward off disputes and militarization, Le Luong Minh told Reuters. \"For ASEAN, such a framework must have substantial elements, and such a code of conduct must be legally binding,\" he said in an interview. Signing China up to a code that it must abide by, and can be enforced, has long been a goal for ASEAN's claimant members: Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei and Malaysia. China claims sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea. China's recent decision to work with ASEAN to draw up a framework for a code, 15 years after they agreed to one, has been met with a mix of optimism and scepticism, coming at a time when Beijing races ahead with development of its seven artificial islands in the Spratlys. It has put radar, runways, hangars and missiles on some of those features, causing alarm in the region and concern about its long-term intentions. The framework, which all sides hope to finish this year, seeks to advance a 2002 Declaration of Conduct (DOC) of Parties in the South China Sea, which commits to following international law, ensuring freedom of navigation and not putting people on uninhabited islands and features. MILITARIZATION ACTIVITIES \"It's important ... because of the complex developments in the South China Sea, especially the reclamation and militarization activities and all those unilateral actions,\" Minh said of the code. \"In that context, the need for an instrument which is legally binding, which is capable of not only preventing but also managing such incidents, is very important.\" Making demands of China is something ASEAN states have long been reluctant to do, wary of their economic dependence on their giant neighbor (para. 1-11).

Six hours after the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit officially ended in Manila, no customary joint statement had been issued and it was unclear whether there was agreement over including references to China's militarization and island-building in the hotly disputed waterway. ASEAN references to the South China Sea issue typically do not name China. Beijing is extremely sensitive to anything it perceives as a veiled reference to its expansion of its seven manmade islands in the Spratly archipelago, including with hangers, runways, radars and missiles. This year's summit comes at a time of uncertainty about U.S. interests in the region and whether it will maintain its maritime presence to counter Chinese assertiveness that has often put the region on edge. A spokesman for the Philippines foreign ministry said a statement would be issued on Saturday. Two ASEAN diplomatic sources earlier on Saturday told Reuters that Chinese embassy representatives in Manila had sought to influence the content of the communique. The sources said the Chinese officials had lobbied the Philippines to keep tacit references to Beijing's island-building and arming of artificial islands out of the statement. But an unpublished draft dated Friday and seen by Reuters included the term \"land reclamation and militarization\", which were not featured in a draft two days earlier. The diplomats said four ASEAN member states had objected to it being omitted. China is not a member of ASEAN and was not attending the summit. China's embassy in Manila could not be reached and its foreign ministry did not respond to request for comment. The content of Friday's draft would indicate ASEAN was resisting moves by China to keep its contentious activities in the strategic South China Sea off ASEAN's official agenda. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who chaired Saturday's meeting, did not answer a question after the summit about whether the statement would refer to \"militarization\". He said ASEAN wanted to complete a framework for a maritime code of conduct with Beijing this year to defuse tensions (para. 1-12). Mogato, M. & Cruz, E. (2017).

Although some Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) leaders will express \"serious concern\" over the \"escalation of activities\" in the disputed sea, ASEAN will drop references, or even allusions, to China's construction of artificial islands and the military hardware it has placed on them, according excerpts of the draft seen by Reuters. The statement would be a watered-down version of that issued last year and comes amid a charm offensive by Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who takes the rotating ASEAN chair this year, to court China for its business and avoid rows over sovereignty in the South China Sea. However, a diplomat from the ASEAN secretariat told Reuters, that officials were still working on the draft of the statement and \"it may still change\" before it is issued at the end of the summit on Saturday. China claims almost entire South China Sea where about $5 trillion worth of sea-borne goods pass every year. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have conflicting claims on the strategic waterway. ASEAN references to the South China Sea issue typically do not name China, which has been expanding its seven manmade islands in the Spratlys, including with hangers, runways, radars and surface-to-air missiles. Last year's ASEAN statement in Laos emphasized the importance of \"non-militarisation and self-restraint in the conduct of all activities, including land reclamation\". According to the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, China will soon be capable of deploying fighter jets on three of its reefs. China insists its activities are for defense purposes and are taking place in what it considers its sovereign waters. The Philippines irked China two months ago when its then foreign minister, Perfecto Yasay, said he and ASEAN counterparts had noticed \"very unsettling\" that weapons systems had been installed, and considered that \"a militarization of the region\". The foreign minister of the former administration, Alberto del Rosario, on Tuesday said the Philippines' hosting of ASEAN summit was an opportunity for Duterte to raise China's militarization. \"We should utilize our leadership to be able to uphold the rule of law,\" he said. \"The leadership of the Philippines will lose a lot of influence if we pass up that opportunity\" (para. 1-11).

They're replacing the large numbers of missile boats, submarine chasers and gunboats patrolling China's extensive littoral waters.\" Popular Mechanics, Feb 23, 'China's New Frigate Design Looks Awfully Familiar - The three-hull design is more heavily armed than the American ship that inspired it': http://www.popularmechanics.com/military/navy-ships/a25375/chian-three-hull-frigate/\nClips from PM article:\n\"The ship is impressively armed for its small size, packing a 76-millimeter gun in the bow, with a field of 16 or 32 vertical launch missile silos behind it. It also has two box launchers of four anti-ship missiles each, two 30-millimeter close-in weapon systems, and a pair of decoy rocket launchers for deflecting incoming missiles. The ship is built to support up to two helicopters with two hangars and a large helicopter landing pad.\nThe ship is very, very similar to the U.S. Navy's Independence-class Littoral Combat Ships. The Independence class is roughly the same weight but 50 feet shorter and with typically thirty percent fewer crew. It is also capable of much greater speeds, \"sprinting\" for short distances at up to 45 knots. The baseline version of the U.S. Navy's trimarans have only a single, smaller 57-millimeter gun and two 30-millimeter guns. A new, upgunned version of the ship adding Hellfire anti-surface missiles and a new over-the-horizon anti-ship missile may begin construction next year.\nIt's unclear why the Chinese Navy would want these ships. China already has a monohull frigate class, the Type 054A Jiangkai II. While the Type 054As are fifty percent larger in tonnage than the new trimaran design, the assembly line is already up and running having already produced 23 of the frigates. Trimaran hulls offer increased stability in high seas and wider hulls to accommodate side-by-side aircraft hangars. This suggests that aviation\u2014both manned and unmanned\u2014is going to be a bigger part of the Chinese Navy's surface fleet of the future.\"  Related:\nGlobal Security, Peoples Liberation Army Navy (PLAN): http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/china/navy.htm Affirming forecast for the passage of time."], [368, "2017-04-16T19:51:46Z", [0.0], ""], [241, "2017-04-16T19:23:52Z", [0.05], ""], [1034, "2017-04-16T07:55:38Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-04-15T21:16:23Z", [0.0], ""], [4634, "2017-04-15T16:11:40Z", [0.05], ""], [691, "2017-04-15T11:42:39Z", [0.15], ""], [1034, "2017-04-15T06:19:25Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-04-15T01:47:37Z", [0.15], ""], [38, "2017-04-14T23:44:54Z", [0.02], "http://thediplomat.com/2017/04/can-the-us-be-reassured-by-chinas-quiet-compliance-with-court-ruling-at-scarborough-shoal/\n\n\u201c. . . .Reporters from Reuters describe the [Scarborough] shoal as still dominated by both Chinese fishermen and law enforcement, but that Filipino fishermen are now mostly unimpeded from fishing both around the shoal and within its lagoon. . . .  \u201cWhile China rejected the legitimacy of last July\u2019s UN court ruling, these reports suggest it is nonetheless complying with its substance. . . . the presence of Filipino fishermen there should provide the United States with strategic reassurance about China\u2019s intentions, as well as confidence that it could intervene in time if China\u2019s intentions change. \u201c. . .China has not deployed any major weapons systems to Spratlys bases, they are capable of hosting significant power projection forces. \u201c . . . the possibility [exists] that a conflict there between China and the Philippines could trigger obligations under the Mutual Defense Treaty between the United States and the Philippines . . .

My assumption is that it is holding fire for now to see what the US will do about it. It is thought possible that Trump will trade control of the Shoals in return for China dealing with the treats of North Korea, but from a medium/long term point of view it may not be wise to allow China to take any more de facto control of areas within the \"nine dotted line\". So at some point I believe the US will need to act, at which point there could be a clash. But with foreign affairs issues in Syria, with Russia, with Iran and with North Korea, my guess is that Trump and China might prefer to avoid raising tensions by starting work on the Shoal this year. The problem for the US is that the longer it leaves China in place policing the fishery the more difficult to claim that China has no right to do it.

China seized the shoal, which is northeast of the Spratly islands, in 2012 and denied access to Philippine fishermen. But after President Rodrigo Duterte visited China last year, it allowed them to return to the traditional fishing area. Earlier this month, Xiao Jie, the mayor of what China calls Sansha City, said China planned to begin preparatory work this year to build environmental monitoring stations on a number of islands, including Scarborough Shoal. Sansha City is the name China has given to an administrative base for the South China Sea islands and reefs it controls. \"China places great importance on the preservation of the South China Sea's ocean ecology, this is certain,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a daily news briefing. \"According to the relevant bodies in China, the reports you mention that touch upon building environmental monitoring stations on Scarborough Shoal are mistaken, these things are not true,\" she added. \"With regards to Scarborough Shoal, China's position is consistent and clear.

Duterte was commenting amid a furor in the Philippines stemming from remarks last week by the mayor in charge of China-controlled disputed islands and reefs, who said preparatory work was being planned to build several monitoring stations, including on the Scarborough Shoal. \"I was informed that they are not going to do anything at Panatag out of respect for our friendship,\" he told a news conference in the early hours of Thursday, referring to the shoal by its local name. \"'We will build nothing there' - that was the assurance given by the Chinese government. \"They are not going to build anything ... because they do not want to jeopardize our friendship\". He said China \"has a word of honor\". He did not specify when he received this assurance.

China's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying on Wednesday said the reports about a monitoring station were \"mistaken\" and \"not true\"  China's activities in the South China Sea, a strategic waterway through which at least $5 trillion of goods passes annually, have been closely watched by the Philippines, which has seen Beijing build and arm artificial islands in its 200-nautical mile exclusive economic zone.

Chinese President Xi Jinping is overseeing a sweeping modernization of the country's armed forces, the largest in the world, including anti-satellite missiles and advanced submarines, seeking to project power far from its shores. In a report late on Thursday, state television's military channel confirmed that the J-20 had now entered service, though it gave no other details. The aircraft was shown in public for the first time in November at the Zhuhai airshow and was first glimpsed by Chinese plane spotters in 2010. However questions remain whether the new Chinese fighter can match the radar-evading properties of the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor air-to-air combat jet, or the latest strike jet in the U.S. arsenal, Lockheed's F-35. The F-22, developed for the U.S. Air Force, is the J-20's closest lookalike. China showed off another stealth fighter it's developing, the J-31, at the last Zhuhai airshow in 2014, a show of muscle that coincided with a visit by U.S. President Barack Obama for an Asia-Pacific summit. China hopes the J-31, still in development, will compete with the U.S.-made F-35 stealth aircraft in the international market, according to state media reports.\nThe navy is another key focus for China. China's navy has been taking an increasingly prominent role in recent months, with a rising star admiral taking command, its first aircraft carrier sailing around self-ruled Taiwan and new Chinese warships popping up in far-flung places. With President Donald Trump promising a U.S. shipbuilding spree and unnerving Beijing with his unpredictable approach on hot button issues including Taiwan and the South and East China Seas, China is pushing to narrow the gap with the U.S. Navy. Wang Weiming, deputy chief of staff of the People's Liberation Army Navy, told Xinhua on the sidelines of the annual meeting of parliament that China is speeding up the development of a marine corps, adding destroyers and frigates and will step up air and sea patrols. \"We will intercept any intruding aircraft and follow every military vessel in areas under our responsibility,\" Wang said. \"Our sailors should stay vigilant and be able to deal with emergencies at all times\" (para. 1-12).

The Shanghai-based conglomerate announced it was taking a controlling stake in a proposed 270-kilometer (168-mile) high-speed rail line linking the eastern cities of Hangzhou and Taizhou. The deal, which also attracted investment from two Chinese automakers, is part of a new government strategy to have private companies take the lead in major infrastructure projects. China spent more than $10.8 trillion on infrastructure from 2006 to 2015, according to Bloomberg calculations. Outlays for roads, airports, ports, railways, and the like rose 17.4 percent last year, far outpacing the country\u2019s 6.7 percent expansion in gross domestic product. With economic growth projected to fall to 6.5 percent this year, the lowest rate since 1990, President Xi Jinping\u2019s government is ever more dependent on the stimulus infrastructure projects provide. Beijing will invest 3.5 trillion yuan in railways by 2020, which among other things will pay for a more than 50 percent expansion of the country\u2019s high-speed network, the State Council Information Office said in late December.

From the perspective of the ASEAN countries (the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia, Singapore, Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam), this U.S. economic disengagement from Asia is a leading indicator of a shift in American grand strategy away from an expansive, multi-faceted approach involving economic, political and military dimensions to one that is more narrowly focused on a military security strategy aimed at establishing a virtually impregnable defensive line (in a conventional military sense) in the Western Pacific running from Japan through Guam to Australia. Beijing\u2019s challenge will be how to take advantage of this window of opportunity to consolidate peacefully its embryonic 21st-century version of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Far from being a threat, the current incarnation of \u201cAmerica First\u201d may well be a boon to Beijing. Strategic Importance of ASEAN Neutrality A key element of the Middle Kingdom\u2019s grand strategy is to foster the neutrality of southeast Asian states in the event of serious conflict between Beijing and Washington. Ultimately, ASEAN neutrality means that no member country would host military facilities for the regular use of outside powers. From Beijing\u2019s national security viewpoint, southeast Asia is critical for two reasons. First, many of the countries\u2014most importantly the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Indonesia\u2014have overlapping and competing maritime claims in the South China Sea that could significantly impede China\u2019s efforts to establish a maritime cordon sanitaire beyond the customary 12-nautical-mile line along its eastern seaboard. Second, the countries sharing common land borders with China (Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam) serve as a buffer protecting China\u2019s vulnerable southeastern underbelly. Clearly, Beijing would prefer that its southeast Asian neighbors are not hostile and avoid policies that could adversely impact China\u2019s vital national security interests. To further this objective, Beijing has embraced an approach using the persuasive allure of soft power\u2014economic, financial and cultural incentives and inducements, with occasional demonstrations of coercive power, military actions and rhetorical saber rattling, to dissuade ASEAN member countries from banding together (and cooperating with the U.S.) to counterbalance China, and to encourage them to remain neutral in any larger struggle between Beijing and Washington over East Asian dominance. China\u2019s economic power provides the gravitational pull to keep the ASEAN countries within its sphere of influence. China is the economic engine of Asia, having displaced both the United States and Japan as the most important trading partner of the ASEAN countries. China is the single-largest provider of bilateral economic development aid to them. In addition, China is sponsoring multilateral institutions (from which the U.S. is conspicuously absent) such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), New Development Bank (NDB or BRICS Bank) and the BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement (BRICS CRA) to further reinforce and identify its central role in funding Asian economic development. The collapse of the American-sponsored TPP trade initiative due to the withdrawal of U.S. support provides a clear path for Beijing to assume the mantle of leadership and promote the Comprehensive Regional Economic Partnership (CREP), the regional trade alternative originally proposed by ASEAN and enthusiastically backed by China. Of course, there is an important cultural dimension that potentially enhances Beijing\u2019s economic soft power, as there are significant minority-ethnic Chinese communities with deep local roots and prominent commercial roles in each of the southeast Asian countries (with ethnic Chinese constituting the majority population of Singapore) (para. 1-3).

That is the disheartening news from China, where its insurance regulator recently updated a more-than 10-year-old table of mortality rates. A key finding: Mortality rates among Chinese men aged 41 to 60, who account for nearly three-quarters of the working-age population, increased by 12% over the decade through 2013, the most recent data available. This was even as mortality rates generally improved across other age groups and genders. It could be that financial success breeds bad health habits. Disposable income per capita has risen 90% in the past six years and probably more than that over the past decade, though official government data is limited. Chinese liquor consumption\u2014where men consume 60% more than women\u2014has risen 5% compounded annually over the past 15 years, considered fast by global standards, according to Bernstein analysts. Richer diets go along with high incidence of lung and coronary issues for Chinese men. The pressure to perform and accumulate wealth in a male-dominated society adds to the health issues. The flip side, however is also true. Their American counterparts for instance, are dying \u201cdespair deaths\u201d in the face of globalization, research by Nobel Laureate Angus Deaton and Princeton economist Anne Case found in 2015. Having fewer men in their working prime could put a damper on China\u2019s productivity growth, which on a per-hour basis has already been slowing since 2010 and remains lower, by as much as a third, than that of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development economies, according to McKinsey. With China\u2019s economy navigating a shift into a more service-oriented economy, labor productivity matters even more. China\u2019s working-age labor force is already shrinking. Urbanization can make up for some of that. But without productivity gains, labor and capital will have to fight harder for the spoils of growth (para. 1-5). Trivedi, A.

China's navy has been taking an increasingly prominent role in recent months, with a rising star admiral taking command, its first aircraft carrier sailing around self-ruled Taiwan and new Chinese warships popping up in far-flung places. Now, with President Donald Trump promising a U.S. shipbuilding spree and unnerving Beijing with his unpredictable approach on hot button issues including Taiwan and the South and East China Seas, China is pushing to narrow the gap with the U.S. Navy. \"It's opportunity in crisis,\" said a Beijing-based Asian diplomat, of China's recent naval moves. \"China fears Trump will turn on them eventually as he's so unpredictable and it's getting ready.\" Beijing does not give a breakdown for how much it spends on the navy, and the overall official defense spending figures it gives - 954.35 billion yuan ($139 billion) for 2016 - likely understates its investment, according to diplomats. China unveils the defense budget for this year at next month's annual meeting of parliament, a closely watched figure around the region and in Washington, for clues to China's intentions. China surprised last year with its lowest increase in six years, 7.6 percent, the first single-digit rise since 2010, following a nearly unbroken two-decade run of double-digit jumps. \"Certainly, the PLA Navy has really been the beneficiary of a lot of this new spending in the past 15 years,\" said Richard Bitzinger, Senior Fellow and Coordinator of the Military Transformations Programme at the S.

Lovers of maritime freedom must reject this campaign in all its forms. In other words, all nations that use the world\u2019s oceans and seas to transact diplomacy, trade and commerce, and martial enterprises must rally against it. Exhibit A: last week the CCP-affiliated tabloid Global Times\nreported that Beijing plans to amend its Maritime Traffic Safety Law (1984). The revised law will empower the authorities to \u201cdesignate specific areas and temporarily bar foreign ships from passing through those areas according to their own assessment of maritime traffic safety.\u201d Among other provisions, it will require foreign submarines to pass through \u201cChina\u2019s waters\u201d on the surface while flying their national flags to identify themselves. CCP potentates are apt to take an extravagant view of what constitutes \u201cChina\u2019s waters.\u201d\nThe Legislative Affairs Office of the ruling State Council further declared that the amendments conform to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), often dubbed a \u201cconstitution for the oceans.\u201d And so they may\u2014if China restricts the law to the territorial seas authorized by UNCLOS. For instance, Article 20 of UNCLOS explicitly states: \u201cIn the territorial sea, submarines and other underwater vehicles are required to navigate on the surface and to show their flag.\u201d Then why bother tinkering with domestic law? Two possibilities: one, China is making a minor modification to the law to conform to the law of the sea, or two, it has ulterior motives. If the first holds, there\u2019s little point in ballyhooing a banal restatement of international law. But if the second scenario holds, this represents yet another attempt to extend Beijing\u2019s territorial sway through law-fare. Chinese leaders, that is, are shrouding their creeping encroachment in concern for maritime safety. And that\u2019s the case in all likelihood. If nothing else, Occam\u2019s Razor should incline observers toward the latter reading of Beijing\u2019s motives. China has typecast itself in recent years: everything it does ends up being geared to political ends\u2014ends that typically involve expanding its authority seaward while banishing painful memories. Past performance may be no guarantee of future results, but it\u2019s the safest way to bet. Especially when past performance has been so consistent. So it\u2019s doubtful in the extreme that China will confine its lawmaking endeavors to the territorial sea, the twelve-nautical-mile belt of sea just off its coasts. What will it do? For one thing, it may apply the law to the seas adjoining underwater rocks that engineers have manufactured into fortified outposts\u2014even though such features are entitled to no territorial sea by treaty. Dredging up seafloor confers no legal prerogatives. More likely, though, CCP officialdom will try to enforce the law throughout the South China Sea, and probably elsewhere in the China seas to boot. Until Beijing proves otherwise, consequently, we should interpret its latest move as yet another effort to project the force of Chinese domestic law throughout the waters and skies within the \u201cnine-dashed line\u201d inscribed on China\u2019s map of the South China Sea. Thus the Maritime Traffic Safety Law represents a small part of a larger bid to repeal\u2014not reinforce\u2014the law of the sea in some 80\u201390 percent of a major waterway. In other words, it will define the South China Sea\u2014high seas, exclusive economic zones, and all\u2014as territorial waters. After all, if China commands \u201cindisputable sovereignty\u201d (or sometimes \u201cirrefutable sovereignty\u201d) within the nine-dashed line, as spokesmen incessantly claim, then it stands to reason that CCP chieftains are the lawgivers there. Making rules and compelling others to obey is what sovereigns do (para. 1-10). Holmes, J. (2017). China Wants to Turn Water Into Territory in the South China Sea (and Beyond). National Interest.

According to internal military reports reviewed by NBC News, almost every week brings another display of U.S. hardware in the waters off China, in a response that has only grown more aggressive since the inauguration of President Trump. A U.S. Navy carrier battle group centered on the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson is now moving through the South China Sea, the stretch of Pacific bounded by China, Vietnam and the Philippines. Three attack submarines, the USS Alexandria, USS Chicago and USS Louisville, have deployed in the Western Pacific in the past month, and at least one has entered the South China Sea. Also in February, the U.S. sent a dozen F-22 Raptor stealth fighters to Tindal AB in northern Australia, the closest Australian military airbase to China, for coalition training and exercises. It's the first deployment of that many F-22s in the Pacific. And if that didn't get the attention of the Chinese government, the U.S. just tested four Trident II submarine-launched ballistic missiles during a nuclear war exercise, sending the simulated weapons 4,200 miles from the coast of California into the mid-Pacific. It's the first time in three years the U.S. has conducted tests in the Pacific, and the first four-missile salvo since the end of the Cold War. The U.S. effort is deliberately broad and overt, according to Pentagon officials, and is meant to be obvious to the Chinese government. Mark Lippert, the former U.S. ambassador to South Korea and deputy national security advisor during the Obama administration, said America is trying to send a message about freedom of navigation, \"free and open commerce and [the] rule of law.\" \"You have to remember what is stake here is principles,\" Lippert told NBC in an interview. \"Adhering to those principles has led to the unprecedented economic and democratic growth in the region.

Trump's administration has called China's island building in the South China Sea illegal.\nBuilding the concrete structures with retractable roofs on Subi, Mischief and Fiery Cross reefs, part of the Spratly Islands chain where China already has built military-length airstrips, could be considered a military escalation, the U.S. officials said in recent days, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\"It is not like the Chinese to build anything in the South China Sea just to build it, and these structures resemble others that house SAM batteries, so the logical conclusion is that's what they are for,\" said a U.S. intelligence official (para. 1-5).

The position of the Chinese at Scarborough prompted the government of former Philippine president Benigno Aquino to seek U.N. arbitration for the seizure, which invalidated many of China\u2019s claims to the South China Sea (para 1-9).

This time around he is about to re-align with the US.\nLast month, Manila filed a protest before the Chinese Embassy over Beijing's reported military buildup on the islands and reefs in the contested Spratly Islands in the South China Sea.\nThe protest comes one month after President Duterte promised to respect defense treaties with \u201cfriend\u201d and \u201cally,\u201d the United States, and two months after Manila warmed up to Beijing and announced a \u201cdivorce\u201d from Washington.\nInvestors get unsettled with high profile flip-flops. They magnify political risks, which add to other investment risks. That's especially the case for countries like Philippines suffering from persistent political instability since the fall of Ferdinand Marcos in 1986, as Ruchir Sharma observes in The Breakout Nations.\nThat's why Philippines\u2019 equity markets headed south after Duterte flip-flopped.\nWhat made Duterte change his mind this time around? \nIt\u2019s hard to say. One plausible answer is China\u2019s ongoing aggression, telling America to stay away from its \u201cown\u201d South China Sea. And sending a warning message to Taiwan in the form of a naval force demonstration \u2013 recently, a group of Chinese warships that included the country\u2019s only aircraft carrier made its way to the South China Sea after passing south of Taiwan in a \u201croutine\u201d exercise.\nAnother plausible answer is a recent survey, which showed 84 percent of Filipinos want Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte to assert his country's rights over its territories in the South China Sea.\nA third plausible answer is a new administration in Washington, which has promised to contain China\u2019s South China Sea ambitions.\nKeeping a record on Philippines\u2019 President\u2019s position on South China Sea disputes is a rather tricky task. Duterte\u2019s flip-flops can be traced back to last July after an international arbitration ruling, which found that China has no historic title over the waters.\nThat was a big victory for both the Philippines, which had filed the arbitration case, and its close ally the US, which wants those waterways to be an open sea (para. 1-11).

He also jolted the region by pulling Washington out of an Asia-Pacific trade deal that Japan had championed.\n\"It's a reassurance message,\" said one Trump administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\"This is for all of the people who were concerned during the campaign that then-candidate, now-president, Trump was skeptical of our alliances and was somehow going to retreat from our traditional leadership role in the region\" (para. 1-6).

It devoted an entire page on Sunday to critiquing Western democracies, quoting former Chairman Mao Zedong\u2019s 1949 poem asking people to \"range far your eyes over long vistas\" and saying the ultimate defeat of capitalism would enable Communism to emerge victorious.\nThe unusual series of commentaries in the People\u2019s Daily mirrors Soviet efforts to promote an alternative political and economic system during the Cold War. The rise of anti-establishment, protectionist politicians like Trump, amid populist winds on several continents, has sent political parties scurrying to shore up their support, helping China to portray itself as relatively steady.\nXi has used recent speeches to international audiences to tout China\u2019s economic and political values and has said that globalization, despite its flaws, should endure via the existing international system of finance and trade.

In addition, in response to the ruling of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague that Chinese claims over 90 percent of the South China Sea area are illegitimate, China remained defiant. Chinese officials even implicitly threatened to establish an Air Defense Identification Zone to control aircraft movements over her claimed territory, which shows Chinese willingness to act unilaterally despite non-recognition from other states (para. 5).\nAs the major counterbalance in the region, the United States responded by persistently operating \u201cfreedom of navigation exercises\u201d as well as joint military patrols with the Philippines and potentially Japan, Australia, and Indonesia. Furthermore, the U.S. also enlarged her financial support for enhancing the military capabilities of ASEAN and East Asian countries and strengthened bilateral defense collaboration with these countries.\nChina\u2019s rival claimants in ASEAN also reacted by increasing their defense budget. Compared to other ASEAN countries, Vietnam had the most significant enlargement, a 113 percent increase in defense expenditure in the 2004-2013 period. Vietnam spent $3.4 billion for military advancement in 2013 alone. Furthermore, Vietnam also actively engaged in strategic arms trade talks with India, Russia, and the U.S. since 2014.\nManila also moved to upgrade its military. The Philippines announced $885 million would be spent on purchase of \u201cthree guided-missile fast attack craft, two guided-missile stealth frigates, and two anti-submarine helicopters.\u201d As a traditional ally of the United States, the Philippines also actively participated in bilateral military exercises with the U.S. and Japan in 2015 under former President Benigno Aquino. And despite the earlier disruption between new President Rodrigo Duterte and U.S. President Barack Obama, the Philippines reasserted her commitment to military cooperation with the U.S. in 2016.\nMalaysia also officially increased its defense spending by 10 percent in October 2014 because of Chinese aggression in the disputed areas near James Shoal. On Admiral Aziz Jaafar, chief of the Royal Malaysian Navy, announced plans to attain \u201ceight guided-missile corvettes and six anti-submarine helicopters \u2026 as well as the acquisition of small craft and the replacement of obsolescent torpedo and missile systems on navy ships.\u201d Even Indonesia, a non-claimant state, also reiterated the country\u2019s concern over the security in the South China Sea and announced her intention to strengthen Indonesia military presence in Natuna Islands.\nIn short, the militarization in response to the South China Sea Dispute poses an inevitable security dilemma for ASEAN countries. In the past, there were incidents of armed clashes in the region. For example, in January 1974, the Battle of the Paracel Islands between China and Vietnam led to  the deaths of 36 troops from both sides. Again, in 1976, 74 Vietnamese sailors were reported dead in a conflict over the Johnson Reef between Vietnam and China. There were also deadly incidents between China and the Philippines. In 1996, Chinese and Filipino gunboats clashed around Capones Island. In 2012, the two sides had a naval standoff over control of Scarborough Shoal. Should military activities continue to intensify, ASEAN citizens will undoubtedly suffer from instability and insecurity (para. 5-10). Tong (2016).

As more people move into cities and China\u2019s economic output rapidly expands, its energy consumption will increase by nearly 50 percent through 2035, accounting for a quarter of all global consumption.\nIn an effort to reduce its dependency on dirty energy and decarbonize its economy, China\u2014also the world\u2019s largest polluter\u2014seeks to switch from coal to gas for power generation, straining its capacity to domestically source power. As a result, the country\u2019s dependence on energy imports will expand from 15 percent today to nearly 25 percent through 2035. Even zero-carbon options like nuclear and renewable energy will not be sufficient to satisfy skyrocketing demand for cleaner energy in China, which will still have to rely on oil and gas.\nChina is eyeing unfettered access to the South China Sea to meet all this demand. Currently, 86 percent of China\u2019s maritime oil imports, as well as more than half of its maritime gas, pass through the South China Sea. Surging supply in global liquefied natural gas, or LNG, along with limited options for China to increase pipeline capacity, mean that maritime shipments will likely increase compared to land-based routes.\nMoreover, the South China Sea itself reportedly holds 11 billion barrels of oil and 190 trillion cubic feet of gas, roughly equivalent to that of Algeria. According to the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), nations hold the right to energy production within their exclusive economic zone\u2014the area within 200 nautical miles of their coast. By claiming islands in the South China Sea as sovereign territory, China establishes its right to all oil and gas resources there.\nMeeting their country\u2019s energy needs is more important to Chinese leaders than some may think. The ruling Chinese Communist Party derives its legitimacy from continually rising economic prosperity, which in turn assures political and social stability. The party\u2019s mandate to lead will weaken if the party can\u2019t guarantee the future flow of energy.\nWith that in mind, China\u2019s no-holds-barred maritime strategy seems more straightforward. For Beijing, maritime routes in the South China Sea are worth securing\u2014even at enormous cost to its regional and international image\u2014in order to maintain credibility at home.\" World Politics Review: http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/ The Diplomat, November 17, 'The Secret Driver of the South China Sea Disputes: China's Hunger for Fish - China\u2019s fish problem is an underappreciated source of tension in the East and South China Seas': http://thediplomat.com/2016/11/the-secret-driver-of-the-south-china-sea-disputes-chinas-hunger-for-fish/ The Times of India, November 7, 'China starts to build its first floating nuclear power reactor for deployment off coast': http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/China-starts-to-build-its-first-floating-nuclear-power-reactor-for-deployment-off-coast/articleshow/55298242.cms\nClip from Times article:\n\"In July, Chinese state media said China aims to launch a series of offshore nuclear power platforms to promote development in the South China Sea, soon after an international court ruled Beijing had no historic claims to most of the waters.\" Affirming forecast.\n"], [29322, "2016-12-04T18:32:28Z", [0.49], ""], [31073, "2016-12-04T14:50:48Z", [0.35], ""], [691, "2016-12-04T14:04:17Z", [0.51], ""], [12605, "2016-12-04T11:43:02Z", [0.2], "DEBUNK ALERT: Yet another \"Coming War with China\" \nhttp://www.telesurtv.net/english/opinion/The-Coming-War-on-China-20161203-0010.html Clairvoyance test:\n- no date range mentioned when such a war is to come\n- no extent of how much violence such a war would entail (death counts, invasions, or simply diplomatic threats) Incredibly unbalanced: \n- no reference to previous \"coming wars with China\" that hasn't been seen (John Mearsheimer, or Huntington, or \"China can say 'no'\")\n- no explanation why 2001--2008 was one of the most cooperative US--China gov't relations since the Reagan/Bush senior administration Though I fully understand the artist; \"the coming peace with China\" simply doesn't sell ... populism."], [1034, "2016-12-04T09:09:56Z", [0.0], ""], [4956, "2016-12-04T04:38:42Z", [0.75], ""], [1034, "2016-12-03T17:10:40Z", [0.0], "Chinas Xi says military must be smaller but more capable Sat Dec 3, 2016 Blanchard (2016) Sat Dec 3, states that: China's armed forces must be smaller but more capable, and if reforms are not properly carried out the military risks falling behind, affecting its ability to wage war, Chinese state media on Saturday cited President Xi Jinping as saying.\nXi unexpectedly announced in September last year that he would cut troop numbers by 300,000, or some 13 percent of the world's biggest military, currently 2.3-million strong.\nThe cuts come at a time of heightened economic uncertainty in China as growth slows and the leadership grapples with painful economic reforms.

The National People's Congress (NPC) in Beijing ruled that lawmakers must swear allegiance to Hong Kong as part of China and that candidates would be disqualified if they changed the wording of their oath of office or if they failed to take it in a sincere and solemn manner. The prospect of the ruling had sparked protests in the former British colony on Sunday. Foreign diplomats were watching closely, stressing the importance of the rule of the law to the city's international reputation. While the controversial decision effectively bars the two pro-independence Hong Kong politicians from being sworn in, a court in the Chinese-ruled city must still rule on the case, taking Beijing's decision into consideration.

China has claimed that a 1279 Yuan dynasty map and subsequent surveys by the royal astronomer Guo Shoujing carried out during Kublai Khan's reign established that Scarborough shoal (then called Zhongsha islands) were used since the thirteenth century by Chinese and Taiwanese fishermen.  At various times between 1951-1991, U.S. and Philippine military forces operating from Philippine bases routinely employed various types of live and inert ordnance at Scarborough Shoal for exercises and other training. As of September 2016, Chinese activities at the Shoal continue. The People's Republic of China and the Republic of China (Taiwan) claim that Chinese people discovered the shoal centuries ago and that there is a long history of Chinese fishing activity in the area. The shoal lies within the nine-dotted line drawn by China on maps marking its claim to islands and relevant waters consistent with United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) within the South China Sea The Philippines state that its assertion of sovereignty over the shoal is based on the juridical criteria established by public international law on the lawful methods for the acquisition of sovereignty. Among the criteria (effective occupation, cession, prescription, conquest, and accretion), the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) has asserted that the country exercised both effective occupation and effective jurisdiction over the shoal, which it terms Bajo de Masinloc, since its independence. Thus, it claims to have erected flags in some islands and a lighthouse which it reported to the International Maritime Organization. It also asserts that the Philippine and US Naval Forces have used it as impact range and that its Department of Environment and Natural Resources has conducted scientific, topographic and marine studies in the shoal, while Filipino fishermen regularly use it as fishing ground and have always considered it their own. In January 2013, the Philippines formally initiated arbitration proceedings against China's claim on the territories within the \"nine-dash line\" that include Scarborough Shoal, which the Philippines said is unlawful under the UNCLOS convention. An arbitration tribunal was constituted under Annex VII of UNCLOS and it was decided in July 2013 that the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) would function as registry and provide administrative duties in the proceedings. On July 12, 2016, the arbitral tribunal agreed unanimously with the Philippines. In its award, it concluded that there is no evidence that China had historically exercised exclusive control over the waters or resources, hence there was \"no legal basis for China to claim historic rights\" over the nine-dash line. The tribunal also judged that China had caused \"severe harm to the coral reef environment\u201d, and that it had violated Philippines\u2019 sovereign rights in its exclusive economic zone by interfering with Philippine fishing and petroleum exploration, for example restricting the traditional fishing rights of Filipino fishermen at Scarborough Shoal.  China however rejected the ruling, calling it \"ill-founded\".\" The Chinese president Xi Jinping insisted that \"China's territorial sovereignty and marine rights in the South China Sea will not be affected by the so-called Philippines South China Sea ruling in any way\", nevertheless China would still be \"committed to resolving disputes\" with its neighbours. Duterte has said he does not consider the Scarborough Shoal dispute to be over territory, but a matter of respecting Filipino rights within its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), even though legal experts believe the shoal is entitled to territorial status under the U.N. Law of the Sea. Duterte\u2019s interpretation thus needlessly cedes the right to define potential Chinese aggression at the shoal as an attack on \u201cterritory\u201d under the terms of the MDT. In defining the dispute in terms of EEZ rights, Duterte also said he would use his coast guard, not his navy to assert Philippine rights at the shoal. As \u201cpublic vessels,\u201d attacks against coast guard cutters are covered under the terms of the MDT. However, the Philippine Coast Guard is woefully over-matched by the Chinese Coast Guard; its largest cutter is nearly 20 times smaller than China\u2019s largest.\n_____________________\nBOTTON LINE:\nReclamation at Scarborough is not a move Beijing would take lightly, particularly given its diplomatic commitments not to undertake such a project.

Simply put, China\u2019s two most recent joint statements with ASEAN make absolutely no sense if Beijing is really planning on building structures on Scarborough in the next months.\nhttp://thediplomat.com/2016/09/china-building-on-scarborough-shoal-dont-hold-your-breath/ Upon closer inspection of the photos released last week by the Philippines, some observers concluded that the ships lacked dredging equipment and represented no imminent threat of reclamation work.\nhttp://qz.com/775382/all-eyes-are-on-the-scarborough-shoal-the-reef-rimmed-lagoon-that-would-allow-beijing-to-control-the-south-china-sea/"], [22243, "2016-10-05T13:27:06Z", [0.5], ""], [28380, "2016-10-05T06:12:26Z", [0.8], ""], [755, "2016-10-05T00:29:41Z", [0.75], "Inquirer.net, October 4, 'Duterte policy to erode US influence in South China Sea \u2013 study': http://globalnation.inquirer.net/146098/duterte-foreign-policy-to-undermine-us-influence-in-south-china-sea-study\nClips from Inquirer article:\n\u201cA major geopolitical shift in Asia appears to have begun in mid-2016, when Rodrigo Duterte became president of the Philippines, and this will undermine the US\u2019s position to the benefit of China,\u201d BMI Research said, noting that \u201cDuterte\u2019s predecessor, Benigno Aquino III, pursued a staunchly anti-China policy, as Beijing adopted an increasingly assertive stance towards its claims to the South China Sea.\u201d\n\u201cAquino bolstered the Philippines\u2019 ties with the US and Japan, both of which are wary of China\u2019s growing military power in Asia,\u201d BMI Research further noted.\nOn the other hand, \u201cDuterte has adopted a noticeably anti-American tone, while sounding more accommodating towards China.\u201d\n\u201cThis suggests that the Philippines\u2019 presence in an informal US-led bloc of Asian nations aimed at counter-balancing China\u2019s rise is no longer assured,\u201d according to BMI Research.\nThe report noted that because of its strategic location between global trade routes connecting the Pacific Ocean and the West Philippine Sea, the Philippines had gained geopolitical importance. \u201cThe US first recognised the Philippines\u2019 strategic significance more than a century ago, when it seized the territory from Spain in the Spanish-American War of 1898,\u201d it said.\" Comments: \n- PRC repeats presence in region is sovereign right and a national security priority. \n- Existing Chinese [SCS] infrastructure points strongly to further expansion.\n- Sudden shift by Manila toward Beijing puts PH bases and military cooperation with USA into question. \n- Beijing may see benefit to start construction before new US president takes office in January, 2017.
