I don't think it matters if Alabamians believe the allegations against Moore. To the type of Christians that inhabit Alabama - and a great many other places in the U.S. - Moore's sexual misconduct is a moral lapse that anyone can fall prey to. Abortion, on the other hand, is considered literally Satanic, and support for it is regarded as a conscious choice to align with evil. The fact that the allegations against Moore are decades old conforms to a theology of redemption and personal transformation through Christianity. I don't know if Moore has made that case, but it's possible that his voters subconsciously make it for him. So when weighing comparative moral lapses, Jones may be considered the greater malefactor simply because of his stance on abortion. For evangelical, fundamentalist and Pentacostal voters, abortion is not just a policy issue. As for spending, I think it's at best irrelevant in this case. The Democrats spent a fortune on advertising for Ossoff - far more than Handel spent - and Ossoff lost. If you are the pro-choice, anti-gun candidate in Alabama, spending on ads won't help you.  Similarly, we keep seeing stories about how committed Republicans can never bring themselves to vote for Moore. This is unsurprising, because the Republican organization in Alabama backed Strange in the primary; Moore was the insurgent candidate. I read an article yesterday that quoted a stalwart Republican woman who couldn't stand Moore. Then they gave her background, and she's related to officers of the state party, and to Republican officeholders in Alabama. People like her may swing the vote to Jones, but I think they are hardly representative, and unless they turn out in large numbers, will have little effect. Perhaps more importantly, I think the Atticus Finch style liberalism that Jones represents has little purchase in Alabama (or anywhere else) anymore. America has changed, politics have coarsened, and behavior that people once considered out-of-bounds is now acceptable, because the only thing that matters is political power. From what I know about Jones, he is portraying himself as a decent man, and therefore worthy of the office. He may well be a decent man, but unfortunately that's not enough anymore - in fact, it may be an impediment. In any case, his stances on abortion and gun rights will, for many voters, disqualify him. Ideally, (from a party standpoint) the Democrats would run a decent man who a majority of people are willing to vote for. As it is, the Republicans appear to be running an indecent man who a majority of people are unwilling to vote against. That's why I think Moore will win.

In any case, the good white Christians of Alabama will not vote for a Democrat, no matter who the Rs put up.  In the olden days of of the Solid South (which was solidly D, this being a moment in history when the Republican party was the less racialist), such voters were referred to as \"yellow-dog\" Democrats, of whom it was said they would vote for a yellow dog on the Democratic ticket rather than any Republican.  The party has changed, but the principle hasn't. I see that this morning some polls have put the D ahead, and it does after all depend more on turnout this year than usually.

But this may echo the presidential election in which Trump raised and spent less than his opponent and looking at FUNDRAISING data may not be as significant.  -Looking at the campaigns, Moore may benefit from the same thing Trump benefited from: bigger MEDIA COVERAGE.  \necause of the allegations against him,  Moore's name is the one dominating tv, print and social media.  Jones' message has gotten lost in the attacks against Moore.  Where have we seen this before? - FOCUS GROUPS last week said they were ready to forgive Moore for his \"transgressions\", many said it wasn't unusual 30 years ago to date teenage girls.  Main issue for focus groups voters was that they did not want Jones and were willing to forgive Moore if that meant not to have someone like Jones representing them in the Senate.   -Looking at campaign ads, social media, websites, the Moore message seems to me like one more likely to \"stick\" than Jones's.  Moore's message speaks directly to his conservative, evangelical base.  Jones message is that of not being Moore.  May not a lot more than that to fire up undecided, get out the vote.  \nRepublican campaigns play to win and their tactics have recently proven to effectively resonate with their base.  \nMistakes made in the presidential election forecasts taught me that thinking that people are not going to vote for someone like X  is no longer a strong enough factor, not since Trump's election, and precisely because of Trump's election.  - Reports of mandatory voter ID, and of DMV offices in predominantly African American areas, is almost certain to affect their turn out. Saw reports 90% were planning to vote for Jones.  Also saw reports that 73% of Republicans planned to vote for Moore.  Don't have enough info to deduce whether that would make a dent on Moore given the number of registered republicans vs registered democrats.   - Lawn signs were also reportedly in much greater numbers for Jones but many said this was because, similarly to the presidential election with Trump, many people didn't want to openly admit they were supporting Moore but would be voting for him.  - So, is this a repeat of the Trump election or has enough changed since Trump's election to cause a big enough effect to make Alabama flip?   Looking at latest POLLS, Fox News just said tonight Dough Jones was ahead by 10 pts.  Coming from Fox News, it has to be an attempt to GOTV for Republicans. \nOthers have said there are no good polls in Alabama because this race is impossible to model.   Here's some interesting take from Monmouth:   \"If the turnout for Tuesday's special election looks like the 2014 midterm, Moore has a 48% to 44% lead over Jones. \nBut if the election looks like turnout models based on the most high-profile statewide election of 2017 so far, last month's gubernatorial race in Virginia, the two men are tied at 46% of the vote. \nAnd if voter demographics resemble the 2016 presidential election, Jones has 48% of the vote to Moore's 45%, according to Monmouth.\" I am going to give Moore the edge because it is Alabama and because I think that as disastrous as the Trump admin may seem for many of us -- given his approval ratings -- the Republican base that got him elected, and specially the evangelical Christians, still strongly support Trump. Based on that, and on the question of \"Alabama values\" voting against Jones, and only 17% believing allegations against Moore, think the majority will vote to elect Moore to the Senate.

(I'm often wrong about U.S. politics.) I've made the basic point before, but here's some elaboration: I think a single political issue---abortion---will determine the outcome of the Alabama senate race. My understanding is that in Alabama enough voters tend vote against pro-choice candidates (like the Democrat in this race) and for anti-abortion candidates (like the Republican in this race) to make the race's outcome a foregone conclusion. (For recent coverage, see, e.g., [1] NPR: https://goo.gl/Xj6WjB , [2] Breitbart: https://goo.gl/zBDBHp .)   A 2014 Pew Poll for Alabama estimated its percentage of people who \"Believe Abortion Should Be Illegal in All/Most Cases\" (58%) lags only two other states---Arkansas (60%) and Mississippi (59%)---although these reported differences may be within the margin of polling error.[3] https://goo.gl/by9HjD For those who\u2019d prefer a picture of Republican strength in Alabama, the following map shows the 2014 results for the election of Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III, whose seat is the subject of this runoff. (Dark red is 90%-99% for Jeff Sessions; red is 80-89% for Jeff Sessions; those are the only colors on the map, if you don't feel like clicking.) [4] https://goo.gl/rQjNu9  In the 2016 Senate Election (a presidential election year; such years usually generate higher Democratic turnout) Republican Richard Shelby won by a large margin (63.9% to 35.8%). Similar results extend back in every election for  another 2.5 decades or so. The last Democrat who won a senate seat in Alabama, Howell Heflin, is dead. He won his last election in 1990 (& had been incumbent since 1979). Excerpts from Heflin\u2019s wikipedia article: \u201cHe strongly opposed legal abortion and all gun control laws. [Gibson note: not true of the current Democratic candidate.] Heflin supported prayer in public schools and opposed extending federal laws against discrimination to homosexuals\u2026 he was one of only two Democrats in the Senate to vote against the Family and Medical Leave Act. He occasionally voted with Republicans on taxes [and was considered to have the option of appointment and confirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court by Republican Ronald Regan had he wanted the job, which he did not].\u201d (Heflin voted with Democrats on affirmative action and opposed a confederate flag patent renewal attempt by the Daughters of the Confederacy; by contrast, his uncle, \"Cotton Tom\" Heflin (also a U.S. Senator) was a white supremacist who bragged of shooting a black man on a Washington, D.C. streetcar (charges dismissed) and was said by a Grand Wizard of the KKK to have been a member of that organization.) Technically, in 1992 a Democrat *did* win a senate seat, but that was Richard Shelby, i.e. the currently Republican Senator Richard Shelby last re-elected in 2016. Shelby switched to Republican in 1994, but he\u2019s been an incumbent senator since 1986---more than three decades. \u201cShelby opposes abortion and has stated on his Senate campaign website that Roe v. Wade is \"...terribly flawed on both a constitutional and moral basis.\" Shelby also opposes taxpayer funding of Planned Parenthood and has voted against a short-term funding bill in Congress because it did not defund Planned Parenthood.\u201d [Wikipedia.] The most recent Senator before those listed above was Republican Jeremiah Denton. From a 1981 New York Times article on (the first female Supreme Court) Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s confirmation proceedings: \u201cSenator Denton said that while he regarded Judge O'Connor as a \u201csuperior candidate,\u201d a \u201cfine lady,\u201d and a \u201cdistinguished jurist,\u201d he could not vote to confirm her because she had refused to criticize the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion.\u201d[5 [endnote]]  Before that, there was Democrat Donald Wilbur Stewart who\u2019d won a special election in \u201978. He was up for reelection in 1980. His opponent in the 1980 Democratic Primary, \u201cFolsom[,] called Stewart \"the worst U.S. senator in Alabama history\" for supporting federally funded abortion, forced busing over long distances and the Equal Rights Amendment.\u201d[6] Folsom defeated Stewart in the primary and then lost to Denton in the general election. So I believe 1978-January 1981 may have been the only time Alabama has ever had a \"pro-choice\"/non-anti-abortion Senator (assuming the veracity of his primary opponent's words on the narrow point of his vote for federal funding of abortion). The next seat back was Democrat (which back then in the south could still mean Dixiecrat) James Allen who won the 1968 election and upon his death in 1978 was succeeded in office by his wife Maryon Pittman Allen, whose reported criticism of segregationist Alabama Democratic Governor George Wallace contributed to her failure to get re-elected. Although she claimed her remarks were distorted, many Alabamans objected to her even agreeing to be interviewed by the Washington Post, which had published the remarks. [Note the same Washington Post broke the Roy Moore story and sponsored this GJO Challenge/Forecasting Problem.] I\u2019m not aware of his wife\u2019s expressing any opinions on abortion during her brief, unelected stint as Senator (Alabama has twice appointed a female Senator (each time to fill a vacancy) but never elected one), but James Allen said of the Supreme Court\u2019s 1973 decision upholding abortion: \u201cI\u2019m shocked at the decision\u2026 bad logic, bad law, bad morals.\u201d[7] At the time of those remarks, the man holding the other Alabama Senate seat, John Sparkman, was most famous for being segregationist (e.g., signed the Southern Manifesto opposing Brown v. Board of Education after having been the Vice Presidential candidate on Agnew's ticket a couple years before); Sparkman was also an opponent of abortion.[8] I believe that's everybody from Alabama who held a U.S. Senate seat after Roe v. Wade (1973) (the case in which the Supreme Court held that a woman's right to an abortion was protected by the Fourteenth Amendment). [9] I\u2019m surprised anyone thinks there is any chance Roy Moore could lose this election, but I've been very wrong before about U.S. political races. One last comment about polling numbers in this race: I don't trust them. When confronted with pollsters I expect some ultimately pro-Moore voters who feel conflicted (due to the sexual assault allegations) to be more likely to clam up or provide inaccurate information than in a normal election. An Alabama historian recently explained the tension between the Alabama electorate's preference for both \"saints\" and former Governor \"Kissing Jim\" Folsom (who boasted of kissing 50,000 women/girls starting with sixteen-year-olds), \"If sophisticated, better-educated cultures that are less evangelical make fun of you and your people you react with a 'bunker mentality.\"[10] [5] http://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/16/us/panel-approves-judge-o-connor.html\n[6] https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/106698692/\n[7] https://goo.gl/aV2sRC\n[8] http://www.nytimes.com/1977/06/30/archives/senate-vote-forbids-using-federal-funds-for-most-abortions-high.html\n[9] https://www.oyez.org/cases/1971/70-18\n[10] https://www.npr.org/2017/12/09/569450216/before-roy-moore-alabama-grappled-with-kissing-jim"], [30364, "2017-12-10T04:46:57Z", [1.0], ""], [34821, "2017-12-10T03:05:50Z", [0.72], ""], [35, "2017-12-10T01:52:37Z", [0.7], ""], [14777, "2017-12-09T23:38:11Z", [0.75], ""], [1056, "2017-12-09T23:24:05Z", [1.0], ""], [42243, "2017-12-09T23:06:02Z", [0.99], ""], [29266, "2017-12-09T21:06:13Z", [0.5], ""], [83, "2017-12-09T19:43:35Z", [0.8], ""], [38387, "2017-12-09T19:25:54Z", [0.69], "More polls came out with Moore in the lead.

Economic impact on Alabama if Moore wins is being explored in the Alabama media -- such as a huge possible Toyota-Mazda plant (see article below).  Other companies may choose to avoid Alabama in relation to Moore's views and behavior if he is elected. Additional economic impacts could also occur. This could sway some voters.

Democrat Doug Jones will win the seat.  The reasons are low voter turnout, arithmetic, GOP stupidity, and people of color adding to voter turnout.   1. This will be a low turnout election. The primary turnout was 18%, http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2017/09/low_turnout_expected_for_roy_m.html and the average midterm is 50ish%. The Presidential election turnout was 61ish%. If people of color turn out, Jones wins. Neither Cook Political nor 538 have even mentioned these fact- low midterm turnout + people of color voting. The reasons for low voter turnout are Moore's unpopularity and the fact that the GOP chose to hold this election in mid-December, when people are involved with Christmas and family.  They could have called the election for the usual November election day but they chose not to, looking for low voter turnout.  It is a case of careful what you wish for.  2. Arithmetic and Moore\u2019s unpopularity\nLook at the August primary results. 589,175 voters went to the polls, according to unofficial results from the secretary of state's office. http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2017/09/low_turnout_expected_for_roy_m.html  Of those, 72 percent voted in the Republican primary. That\u2019s 424,206 votes.  Let\u2019s highlight this:  August GOP turnout was 72% of 18% of registered voters.  Pretty low turnout.   Of those, 258,000 all voted for a Republican other than Moore. They might be disgusted with him. Now assume some of those Republicans don\u2019t vote in December. So that 258,000 votes is about how much you have to increase Democratic voter turnout.   3. People of color are 29% of the state's registered voters. They are part of the Democrats  but not all of them.  They are presumed to be 100% Democratic voters.  The state of Alabama claims 3,330,802 registered voters. http://www.al.com/opinion/index.ssf/2016/11/are_99_percent_of_alabama_vote.html. 29% of all registered voters = 280,120. 280,120 \u2013 258,000 = 22,120 votes.  That\u2019s all it takes. 22,120 votes to beat Judge Roy Moore.  If Jones wins, it will prove that other southern states are also winnable if you focus on black voter turnout.Before they were killed, MLK and RFK were going to put us on the right track, with organized black church, labor, and worker turnout.... The people have to want to do this, organize themselves in the churches, clubs, and have a vision of it...it has been a long time since 1968."], [485, "2017-11-26T17:09:17Z", [0.47], "Monday, Nov. 27, is the last day to register to vote in Alabama.

The Post's publication of the accusations against Moore will quite possibly have no effect on the election, even if that are proven to be true (which for all I know, they are). The Post probably thinks these accusations will be considered disqualifying by religious people. Nothing could be further from the truth. The type of religious people who are going to vote for Moore believe in a theology of redemption, and that all humans are by nature sinners. The important thing is not Moore's past sins, but his current acceptance of Jesus. To think these accusations, by themselves, would be considered disqualifying by religious people in Alabama is to completely misunderstand Christian theology as it is preached among evangelicals and fundamentalists. Moore is accused of engaging in inappropriate conduct with underage girls, and one instance of sexual abuse because the girl was under the age of consent. This is a serious matter, but it would almost certainly not be regarded as worse than what tens of thousands of his voters had done before they were \"saved.\" This is the whole point of becoming \"saved;\" to a religious voter in Alabama, of course Moore was a sleazeball before he was saved. So was everybody else. To believers in this type of Christian theology, you can't judge people for their past sins, because everyone would be found wanting. What matters to them is his current faith. The validity of the theology itself is irrelevant; this is the reality of how a great many voters are going to see this. So here are three scenarios that might play out: 1) No further evidence is given of Moore's inappropriate conduct - result: Alabama voters consider the whole thing a hatchet job by the Washington Post. Moore wins.\n2) The allegations are irrefutably proven - result: Moore appeals to the voters that he has been redeemed and has received the Holy Spirit. Moore wins.\n3) (Least likely, imo) Moore is forced off the ticket and a replacement is found to run on the Republican line. Moore's replacement wins. So whatever happens, a Republican wins. I think Moore can ride this out and win in December - even if the allegations prove to be true - and in any case, neither the allegations against Moore nor the replacement of Moore by another candidate will necessarily induce people to vote for Jones."], [34353, "2017-11-10T18:29:39Z", [0.75], "Starting relatively high.
