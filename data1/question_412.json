The audio recording was released online by the militant group overnight, fuelling US suspicions the IS leader has been in hiding on the Iraq-Syria border and not dead, casting further doubt on claims by Russia it had killed him in an air strike in May. In the rambling 46-minute recording the speaker, who sounds like Baghdadi, appears to refer to recent events, including North Korean nuclear threats to the US and Japan, as well as the \"nearly year-long battle for Mosul\", which fell to Iraqi forces in July. Senior Australian counterterrorism officials told the ABC they feared the speech would be a morale boost for local supporters who have been demoralised by Islamic State's retreat in Syria and Iraq (para 1-4).

While one could argue that Coalition intelligence should have been able to identify this facility early on with the amount of resources it possesses, the fact that more than 150 armoured fighting vehicles could be overhauled and upgraded here seems to directly contradict this possibility. While regime forces not only captured the facility, but would also be presented with large numbers of photographs taken inside 'The Workshop', it is likely that the sheer inefficiency of the Syrian military apparatus prevented any action to be taken against it. (...) several other members of the 'Tank Battalion' and technicians of 'The Workshop' could also be identified thanks to their presence on social media. While Twitter had already declared war on designated terrorist groups in 2014, banning the accounts of Islamic State fighters and its supporters, large numbers of Islamic State fighters continue to maintain accounts on various other social media platforms, most notably Facebook. The author made several attempts to get in contact with several of these individuals by posing as a member of a different unit from the 'Tank Battalion' for the gathering of information and photographs of their operations and daily life in Syria, leading to the removal of the account by Facebook on several occasions. Ironically, many of the accounts of the Islamic State fighters in question remain present on Facebook to this day. Although it is extremely likely that foreign fighters played a vital role in running 'The Workshop', their presence here could not be verified. Many of the Islamic State tankers active on Facebook are not only friends with each other, but also with fighters of various other factions fighting for control over Syria. Indeed, most appear to have bonded by their shared passion for armoured fighting vehicles, choosing to ignore whatever religious beliefs and other differences may divide them. Posing with their tanks, photographing them from different angles and even becoming members of tank enthusiast groups on Facebook, their presence on social media certainly provides for an interesting insight into the life of Islamic State fighters one doesn't get to see often. \""], [1034, "2017-09-01T06:28:48Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [368, "2017-08-31T23:05:00Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [28414, "2017-08-31T19:34:27Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "Top commander says ISIS leader most likely still alive\nhttp://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/31/abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-likely-alive-242210"], [691, "2017-08-31T11:30:32Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [1034, "2017-08-31T10:35:20Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [21884, "2017-08-31T08:34:41Z", [0.0, 0.02, 0.98], ""], [32872, "2017-08-31T07:46:55Z", [0.0, 0.03, 0.97], ""], [38662, "2017-08-30T23:12:41Z", [0.0, 0.02, 0.98], ""], [38664, "2017-08-30T22:55:09Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [29591, "2017-08-30T20:13:53Z", [0.0, 0.07, 0.93], "Lowering forecast:  Considering it increasingly unlikely that IS will be able to elect a new Caliph with nearly 1 month to go.\nThe group appears to still have the ability, albeit slightly, to coordinate; the recent cease-fire between Hezbollah, the Syrian Regime and Islamic State, made way for IS to transport about 670 IS terrorists and their families heading for Deir al-Zour.

But even as Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi made the bold assertion, deadly fighting continued in Mosul \u2014 filling field hospitals and forcing hundreds to flee. \"We are seeing the end of the fake Daesh state.

Our brave forces will bring victory.\" Across the border in in Raqqa, coalition officials predicted a long, bloody battle ahead for the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, whose fighters succeeded in completely encircling the militants' de-facto capital Thursday. U.S.-led coalition officials estimated that as many as 2,500 IS fighters remained in the city (para. 1-4).

Eight months into the Mosul offensive, IS now holds less than two square kilometers (0.8 square miles) of the city, but the advances have come at considerable cost (para. 8).

By contrast, Baghdadi, born as Ibrahim Awad al-Samarrai' in 1971, comes from a family of preachers and studied Islamic law in Baghdad. The appointment of the new leader would require the approval of an eight-member shoura council, an advisory body to the caliph.

I don\u2019t think it will be long before Baghdadi is found and killed, as the intelligence agencies would have learnt some lessons from Osama bin Laden\u2019s tactics. In which case, Abu Hafsa al-Mawsely is reported to be Baghdadi\u2019s replacement. Whether the IS caliphate will survive until October is also an important aspect, as IS is being forced out of Mosul it is most likely going to be Raqqa that determines the fate of the caliphate; an article from the BBC in 2015 states: \u201cOnce IS starts losing significant territory and stops being able to provide protection and basic services to people living on its territory, it risks ceasing to be the state or caliphate it claims to be\u201d (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-33291429)\n\u201cThe Caliphate significance was that at one time it ruled territory with a population of 5 to 6 million in Iraq and Syria\u2026.IS may still control some of the territory but it has nothing like the human and material resources it enjoyed at the height of its power\u201d (http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/isis-mosul-iraq-caliphate-islamic-state-a7608981.html). If the caliphate is crumbling nearer October, it might mean that they won\u2019t declare a caliph replacing Baghdadi, on the other hand, they wouldn\u2019t want to make it look like they are weakening. \nAn article from Osservatorio Mashrek explained why the caliphate would survive despite the military retaking IS controlled areas. \n\u201cFor Islamic state leadership, military defeat while unavoidable in Mosul, will not be decisive for the existence of the group and the caliphate. Their project\u2019s hopes will only evaporate if the Sunni population is drawn into a fair political process and if the loyalty of the Sunni tribes is broken.\u201d (http://www.osservatoriomashrek.com/islamic-state-conflict-caliphate-will-survive-iraq/) With the increasing presence of US military in Iraq and Syria, countries part of the coalition fear this will push IS out of the middle east into south east Asia. \nAustralia\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, said \u201cThere is concern that IS may well seek to declare a caliphate, an Islamic caliphate, in the southern Philippines\u201d (https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/mar/26/julie-bishop-says-australia-preparing-for-isis-to-declare-caliphate-in-southern-philippines). I don\u2019t have a deep understanding of Islam, so I\u2019m not sure if this means they can declare a caliph? I expect if they declared a caliphate affiliated with ISIS then their caliph will be Baghdadi.

I\u2019m not sure how many of the other member countries of the Global coalition are devoting their resources to finding Baghdadi, but \u201cthe US government has had a joint task force to track down Baghdadi which includes special-ops forces, the CIA and other US intelligence agencies, as well as spy satellites of the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency\u201d (http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-mosul-battle-deputies-alone-desert-islamic-state-caliph-a7618331.html#gallery) \nIraq is also hunting Baghdadi; \u201cIraqi F-16\u2019s carried out a strike on a house where he was thought to be meeting with other commanders in Western Iraq\u201d (http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-mosul-battle-deputies-alone-desert-islamic-state-caliph-a7618331.html#gallery)  The most important time frame will be the time between Baghdadi\u2019s death and the capture of Raqqa. If Baghdadi dies long before Raqqa is captured, then its possible IS will declare a new caliph - therefore its possible that if Secretary Tillerson\u2019s words are to be taken literally, another caliph will be proclaimed by October 2017. If Baghdadi outlives Raqqa\u2019s recapture then another caliph won\u2019t be proclaimed.   However, GJO\u2019s question isn\u2019t specific to IS. The reason I bring this up is because on the 24th August 2014 \u201cBoko Haram, in Nigeria, Abubakar Shekau declared a caliphate. Apparently it remained unclear whether Shekau declared his group to be part of ISIL or if he was declaring a separate caliphate in Nigeria. In 2015, Shekau declared allegiance to ISIL\u201d (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Caliphs). It is possible that another islamic extremist group could declare a caliphate - though I\u2019m not aware of any other islamic terrorist organisations large enough to declare caliphate, other than the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant - Yemen Province (ISIL-YP, though they have declared their allegiance to Baghdadi) and possibly Al-Qaeda. I say large enough in terms of the elements which Al-Qaeda believes are necessary for the creation of a state; \u201cOsama bin Ladin wrote a letter arguing there were necessary pre-requisites and conditions for the creation of the coming Caliphate, including \u201cthe essential foundations to function and defend itself.\u00a0If our state is not supported by the proper foundations,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe enemy will easily destroy it.\u201d (http://news.siteintelgroup.com/blog/index.php/about-us/21-jihad/4403-al-qaeda-and-the-islamic-state-caliphate) "], [33955, "2017-03-28T19:32:39Z", [0.05, 0.15, 0.8], ""], [27313, "2017-03-28T19:24:09Z", [0.0, 0.5, 0.5], ""], [34587, "2017-03-28T18:22:49Z", [0.3, 0.6, 0.1], "Taking a chance "], [691, "2017-03-28T13:40:07Z", [0.03, 0.15, 0.82], ""], [23355, "2017-03-28T10:18:35Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [34574, "2017-03-28T08:55:36Z", [0.1, 0.15, 0.75], ""], [34573, "2017-03-28T05:19:49Z", [0.25, 0.75, 0.0], ""], [26242, "2017-03-28T02:33:01Z", [0.0, 0.25, 0.75], ""], [368, "2017-03-28T00:51:27Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [34568, "2017-03-27T23:03:38Z", [0.15, 0.65, 0.2], ""], [34563, "2017-03-27T20:41:01Z", [0.05, 0.45, 0.5], ""], [34562, "2017-03-27T20:14:16Z", [0.1, 0.5, 0.4], ""], [34557, "2017-03-27T19:38:30Z", [0.0, 0.5, 0.5], ""], [34557, "2017-03-27T19:37:54Z", [0.5, 0.5, 0.0], ""], [34556, "2017-03-27T18:51:14Z", [0.0, 0.23, 0.77], ""], [34554, "2017-03-27T18:22:05Z", [0.02, 0.03, 0.95], ""], [34553, "2017-03-27T18:17:01Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [34552, "2017-03-27T18:10:02Z", [0.0, 0.3, 0.7], ""], [23117, "2017-03-27T17:57:19Z", [0.01, 0.08, 0.91], ""], [691, "2017-03-27T15:51:05Z", [0.03, 0.15, 0.82], ""], [22833, "2017-03-27T13:21:37Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [34549, "2017-03-27T11:35:05Z", [0.1, 0.9, 0.0], ""], [34550, "2017-03-27T11:32:54Z", [0.1, 0.25, 0.65], ""], [34546, "2017-03-27T10:53:02Z", [0.05, 0.45, 0.5], ""], [34544, "2017-03-27T07:08:25Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.9], "GJP consensus, fact that he has survived until now, possibility of ISIS hiding his death when he dies"], [34543, "2017-03-27T03:36:43Z", [0.99, 0.01, 0.0], ""], [6303, "2017-03-27T03:30:16Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.99], "Based on general news and GJP consensus."], [368, "2017-03-26T19:45:29Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [691, "2017-03-26T15:13:38Z", [0.03, 0.15, 0.82], ""], [34441, "2017-03-26T10:35:52Z", [0.01, 0.09, 0.9], ""], [34530, "2017-03-25T23:20:56Z", [0.1, 0.25, 0.65], "Few have proclaimed themselves caliph before the Islamic State, so the likelihood of that happening again is low.

I\u2019m all for collaborators to add to this list. Part II. will be the probabilities after I\u2019ve had some time to research each factor laid-out here. In the question itself is really two distinct considerations: \n1- Will he be the caliph of IS on 1 October? \n\u2022\tthis would\u2019ve been a garden variety GJ question, that would probably entail most of the analysis we\u2019re going to have to do anyways. So, I assume they didn\u2019t ask it for a reason, though its irrelevant to figuring this out.\n2- Will someone else be the caliph of IS on 1 October? \n\u2022\tWho? How? When? Where? Why? There\u2019s a lot more to this part of the question than the first because it assumes the perpetuity of IS in the sense that if its leader is not going to be al-Baghdadi, then it has to be someone else, because IS isn\u2019t going away; it also assumes they have to have a caliph at all. Which means the questions -who/what/when/where/why- are more about the technical workings and stability of the Islamic State, rather than the individual \u201csomeone else\u201d in question.  In the \u2018more info\u2019 section:\nOthers have pointed out the uncertainty around who/what mechanism would actually do the \u201cbe proclaimed\u201d bit. I think the more info section scopes the conversation to the current Islamic State which al-Baghdadi leads. Thus, if there is a reasonable likelihood that a street vendor in Morocco or a devout follower in Nebraska could proclaim himself to be caliph AND the IS acknowledge that by some process/event/media, then that should be factored into the probability; I\u2019m just not familiar with whether there is a \u2018process\u2019 here to be researched. Imo, the reality is, its very unlikely both things would happen (a loner claiming to be caliph AND the IS proclaiming him as such). So, whether it would count or not, I don\u2019t think it has much effect on where we\u2019ll end up overall because its already such a low likelihood) Also in the more information: \u201ccontinues to hammer at the IS\u201d; this statement combined with the articles provided shine a light on needing to factor in the dissolution of Islamic State from defeat, its potential fracturing from internal turmoil/betrayal, or maybe one of the Islamaic State arms outside of Iraq and Syria causing an IS split\u2026 Can there be two caliphs? What would that look like? Who would challenge al-Baghdadi? In the answer options:\nfirst option: a few scenarios could unfold that resolve here\n- he leaves voluntarily and IS proclaims a replacement\n- he leaves involuntarily and IS proclaims a replacement\n- an Islamic State province directly challenges his position, with another/new leader proclaimed by the members of that province to be Caliph\n- IS declares it has two caliphs, and just names another one second option \u2013 he dies, and he\u2019s replaced\n- natural causes\n- natural disaster\n- bullet between the eyes third option \u2013 this is status quo and at the outset, is my highest probability. Purposeful and planned change takes a long time\u2026and the more pieces involved, the longer it takes-- 228 days is not long. And I'm not sure if research will support that there is a move underway for IS leadership change.
