EU ministers endorsed 18 pages of legally binding instructions for the bloc\u2019s chief negotiator Michel Barnier, who is aiming to start formal talks in the week beginning June 19, almost exactly a year after Britain\u2019s referendum vote to leave the union. The EU stance demands the maximum possible from London on the so-called \u201cdivorce\u201d phase of the negotiation, showing little restraint on demands over financial liabilities or legacy obligations. During the ministers\u2019 discussions, Michael Roth, Germany\u2019s European affairs minister, said that the reality of Brexit\u2019s costs had yet to break through in London and that the EU27 had to brace for that moment in weeks to come. \u201cWe have two years. The clock is ticking,\u201d Mr Roth told journalists in Brussels. \u201cWe have to get down to work.\u201d In recent weeks member states have hardened the EU\u2019s stance, setting increasingly exacting requirements for Britain in the divorce stage of the negotiations to meet before trade talks can begin. Even with an election campaign in full flow in Britain, there were few signs of reservations or dissent among the 27 ministers over the aim-high approach to talks. This includes a maximalist view of Britain\u2019s financial obligations that underpins an estimated exit bill of \u20ac55-75bn in net terms, covering everything from the costs of moving London-based EU agencies to EU farm payments in 2019 and 2020. In gross terms, the EU has raised its opening demand for Britain\u2019s Brexit bill to up to \u20ac100bn. Mr Barnier is not seeking upfront agreement on a final bill, but will seek detailed principles to be agreed on rights and money that could not be reopened at a later stage of talks (para. 1-9).

Prime Minister Theresa May will next Wednesday launch a two-year countdown to Brexit. Asked if she feared other countries would quit the bloc, Merkel told the Passauer Neue Presse: \"No. Individual member states of course have different ideas about how we shape the future, but the overall way forward is clear: more cooperation.\" She pointed to defense, control of the EU's external borders, economic policy and the fight against Islamist militancy as areas for cooperation. Merkel said May's impending letter to begin the Brexit process would not overshadow the EU's 60th anniversary summit. \"The work for the coming years will go in both directions: On the one hand, the exit negotiations with Britain, and on the other considerations about making the EU of 27 members fit for the future,\" she added in the interview published on Friday. Asked whether EU accession negotiations with Turkey should be broken off, Merkel replied: \"We should await the vote on the referendum in Turkey and everything else.\" Turkey is planning an April 16 referendum on constitutional changes that would extend President Tayyip Erdogan's powers. Merkel said she took very seriously a European legal report that calls Turkey's proposed constitutional changes a big setback for democracy. Turkey has rejected the report (para. 1-9). Carrel, P.

What Do the EU Nations Really Want? Wishart, Groendahl, and Simon (2017) March 8, states that: From safeguarding citizens\u2019 rights to protecting their national economic interests, European Union governments are sharpening their red lines while maintaining general unity as Theresa May prepares to formally withdraw the U.K. from the bloc.\nWith less than a month to go before the British prime minister triggers Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty to start two years of divorce negotiations, a Bloomberg News analysis shows that, while the EU\u2019s 27 other governments have differing priorities, they remain united in wanting Michel Barnier, the bloc\u2019s chief negotiator, to drive a hard bargain. Brexit isn\u2019t on the agenda of a two-day summit of EU leaders starting on Thursday in Brussels, but it will be the elephant in the room (para. 1-2). Reflecting that, nearly nine months since Britain voted to leave, the EU\u2019s 27 other countries have added new negotiating positions and refreshed others. Some maintain they want to keep as close ties to the U.K. as possible, others can barely conceal their ambition to punish the U.K. for leaving the club. Practically all say the U.K. needs to be seen to be worse off outside the EU than in it (para. 5).\nThrow into the mix the likelihood of the U.K. being charged about 60 billion euros ($63 billion) for leaving, wrangling over whether it can fully escape the clutches of the European courts and the rule that it must exit the EU without any deal if it isn\u2019t concluded before the deadline, and it\u2019s not hard to see why diplomats are bracing for difficult talks (para. 5-6).

This time around, France has joined the club.\nSome investors are selling French government debt, worried that the country will elect Marine Le Pen as its president, a candidate that has promised to take the country out of the eurozone. That has left French bonds behaving increasingly like their peers in the parts of Europe hit hardest by the 2011-12 sovereign-debt crisis.\nIt is quite a flip for Europe\u2019s second-largest economy. After that crisis, French bonds traded with Germany\u2019s. On Monday, a poll showing Ms. Le Pen comfortably in the lead for April\u2019s first round of the presidential election drove yields on French 10-year bonds to jump to 1.064%. Yields rise as bond prices fall.\nThe spread with German bond yields hit 0.84 percentage point during the day on Monday, the highest in more than four years, before settling at 0.75 percentage point as European markets closed. Six months ago, this gap was only 0.22.\nAlso rising are Italian and Portuguese 10-year yields which are up by around 0.7 percentage point against Germany\u2019s in the last six months. Greek yields have jumped.\nThe premium that investors demand for holding the debt of these nations over richer northern European economies like Germany and the Netherlands will continue to rise as a range of risks grow and the European Central Bank\u2019s massive bond buying program buys less debt, investors say.\nIt could be French yields leading the charge higher this time. Analysts at Japanese bank Mizuho Financial Group, Inc. told their clients Monday that they should stop treating French government bonds on par with German or Dutch debt (para. 1-7).

It could yet scupper the whole process. \nBefore Britain\u2019s referendum last June, Leave campaigners promised voters that Brexit would save the taxpayer \u00a3350m ($440m) a week. That pledge was always tendentious. But officials in Brussels are drawing up a bill for departure that could mean Britain\u2019s contributions remain close to its membership dues for several years after it leaves. In a new report for the Centre for European Reform, a think-tank, Alex Barker, a Financial Times correspondent, puts the figure at anything between \u20ac24.5bn ($26.1bn) and \u20ac72.8bn (para. 1-2).

And in the worst case scenario of a Marine Le Pen win to the Presidency, she will not have enough votes to a majority, and therefore she would need to negotiate that with the other party/ies. Same goes for The Netherlands. That said, there are few more things to take into consideration: 1.    EU is very worried about the present situation (when not amused by Trump) \n2.   Although a Le Pen victory keeps looking very unlikely, there are lots of discussions on case scenarios of France calling it off the euro and therefore the end of it.\n3.   On a presumptive scenario of France leaving the euro (I suppose one has to leave the EU too in that case, but this is not at all clear); there is a lot of discussion on how a countries debt would be repaid in case of an exit. Although to me, it doesn't really matter in what currency you pay it. The BIS (Bank for International Settlements) is the Bank that handles international settlements as the name says; you can pay say US$2000.00 in either currency as long as the creditor the US in this example gets the $2000.00. There is plenty of fascinating literature on these kind of problems in the years 1920-1930 when the sterling was on the Gold Standard. There were a lot of currencies wars back then; and that is why UK and US saw the need for the IMF.  I think that it will be a little like Brexit. They do not know what will happen until it happens. In any case for France:   David Rachline, the head of strategy for the National Front, said in an interview that only around 20 per cent of France\u2019s total public debt \u201cfalls under international law [and would stay denominated in euros]\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009but for the rest we will have the right to change the currency.\u201d   That means that:  Around \u20ac1.7tn of French public debt could eventually be redenominated into francs if the far-right National Front party gets into power, according to party officials, in what would according to ratings agencies amount to the world\u2019s largest ever sovereign default. [please note the tn = trillions!]  This would, according to rating agencies, be likely to amount to the largest sovereign default on record, nearly ten times larger than the \u20ac200bn Greek debt restructuring in 2012, threatening chaos to the world financial system on top of the collapse of the single currency. These talks alone made the spread between French 10-year sovereign bonds and the benchmark German Bund \u2014 reflecting the increased riskiness of French debt relative to German debt \u2014 this week hit a four-year high. But mainstream economists argue that France leaving the euro would cause chaos in Europe, bringing the continent to the bleak scenario I mentioned above of the 1930s. Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9, executive board member at the European Central Bank, this week said that leaving the euro would lead to \u201cimpoverishment\u201d, higher interest rates, a heavier debt burden, unemployment and inflation. I can trow in other problems as they come to mind:  1.  France is now the only country that has nuclear capabilities; leaving the UK and France, Europe need to defend herself from our neighbor Putin; Germany surely has the capability to do so, quick, fast, and well. \n2.    The FN argument is similar to the Brexit; we will export more. To whom? will they fight with UK for the US market? \n3.    Since the argument is similar to Brexit, I suppose many [countries] would be very interested in watching UK reaction once they will receive the check from the EU to be paid before leaving: In a new report for the Centre for European Reform, a think-tank, puts the figure at anything between \u20ac24.5bn ($26.1bn) and \u20ac72.8bn.  \n[I wonder if they will leave a TIP!]\n4.\tFN also says the want their industry more competitive. What is preventing them to do so now? \n5. \tFN also talks about protectionism, but right now in Europe there is plenty of cooperation for terrorism, intelligence, military. Alone they will have less not more. \nIncidentally, it was the French police that helped the Belgians with their terrorists attacks; and Italy captured the Berlin truck driver in no time, thanks to the cooperation among countries. Theresa May confessed in an interview that she cannot sleep at night because of Brexit; and I believe her. I don't know what kind of woman Le Pen is, but I am sure in case of a victory, when put in front of the crude reality, would she go along with it?  The EU Parliament can be very convincing with Le Pen, like it was for Tsipras back then when an MEP passionately ask him to be \" .....a real leader and not a false prophet!....\" ITALY:  The far right leaders embracing Trump are the Italian Salvini, but he is not a treat. The M5S are keeping quiet, they have troubles of their own right now. But elections now do not seem so close by. The fear of the spread is still high, and an announcement of new elections will make the spread unsustainable for the Italian already high sovereign debt. Netherlands:  Geert Wilders said  \u201cI want to be prime minister. The question is if they want me to be prime minister\u2026\u00a0The odds of me becoming prime minister, are perhaps not in my favour, but I\u2019m confident that if we get the result, according to the current polls that it is a real possibility.\u201d But Mr. Wilders admitted it was possible other parties could refuse to cooperate with him, opening the way for a minority coalition to rule although he could command the largest single party.  Germany:  Die Linke, Germany\u2019s largest left party, has long been split between its reformers and its radicals. The populist right will likely make a strong showing, estimated around 10-15 percent. Apparently, Alternative for Germany (AfD) will not only gain access to parliament but also become the third-largest faction.\nHowever, Angela Merkel\u2019s center-right CDU/CSU\u00a0will once again control the largest faction in the Bundestag. Its poll numbers have been relatively stable (around 35 percent), far ahead of the Social Democrats\u00a0(SPD), whose decline continues. The SPD now pulls around 20 percent of voters. This is an just an opinion, but I think that in Europe DT is reminding people way too much to the rise in power in the 1930 of Hitler. That is a big deterrent for Europeans! I think however, that Economics will be the deciding factor to keep countries in the EU (It's the Economy stupid!]\n"], [1034, "2017-02-12T07:23:11Z", [0.0], "Juncker says Britain may divide EU over Brexit talks Nasr (2017) Sat Feb 11, states that:  European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said he fears Britain will divide the European Union's 27 remaining members by making different promises to each country during its Brexit negotiations.\n\"The other EU 27 don't know it yet, but the Brits know very well how they can tackle this,\" Juncker told Deutschland funk radio. \"They could promise country A this, country B that and country C something else and the end game is that there is not a united European front.\"\nBritain will by the end of March trigger formal divorce talks with the EU, a major test for the bloc which is struggling to have a grip on other challenges like keeping Greece in the euro zone, the refugee crisis and the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president.\nTo add to all of that, the Netherlands, France and Germany are holding general elections this year, in which populist anti-EU parties are expected to make strong showings.\n\"Now everyone is saying in relation to Trump and Brexit: 'Now is Europe's big chance.

Any attempt made to cajole us [on corporation tax], as far as I'm concerned, we're out the door,\" he told the Irish Independent.  Any bid to rein in tax agreements drawn up by Ireland would, he said, put the country at a disadvantage when compared to a UK outside of Europe and unfettered by the same restrictions.  \"We cannot be tied into an anti-business, anti-growth pact while the Brits are allowed to move on. We have a lot more to lose than anybody else,\" he said. \"The two-year investigation by the EC into Apple's tax affairs found that two tax rulings that Ireland gave to the company substantially and artificially lowered the tax Apple paid in the country since 1991. The tax deal allowed Apple to pay billions of euros less than would otherwise have been the case, with the firm at one point paying a tax rate of just 0.005 percent. \"Following the EC decision, Hayes again raised the prospect that Ireland would become less attractive as a place to do business. \"The credibility of Ireland's business environment is on the line here,\" he said. \"What is also at stake is our future ability to attract FDI [foreign direct investment] into the country with a taxation system that is certain, clear and based on Irish law.\"  Other economic analysts have backed Hayes' argument that a Britain outside of the EU could be well-placed to use the promise of lower taxation to lure companies like Apple to the UK. \"For its part, Apple has already warned that the EC's decision, which is being challenged by both Apple and the Irish government, \"will have a profound and harmful effect on investment and job creation in Europe\". However, Apple also said that it remains \"committed to Ireland and we plan to continue investing there\". \"The harm that the EC's decision will do to this investment is also the number one fear for the Irish government.  \"Ireland has very real concerns about the way in which the European Commission is undermining the international consensus, impeding reform and creating uncertainty for business and investment in Europe,\" a spokesperson for the Department of Finance said. \"But while an independent Ireland would have more control over taxation, if Ireland were to leave the EU it could also complicate matters for domestic businesses, leaving firms wrestling with uncertainty over trade tariffs and continued access to EU markets.\n. . . \n\"When it comes to public sentiment about Europe in Ireland, the Irish public have voted against EU interests in the past, with the majority of voters (53 percent) rejecting the Treaty of Lisbon when a referendum was held in 2008.  However, a second referendum in 2009 saw 67 percent back the treaty. The Taoiseach, the Irish Prime Minister, also actively encouraged British citizens to vote to remain in the EU, ahead of the referendum in June. \"Ultimately the chance of the EC's decision on Apple having any meaningful impact on Ireland's future in the bloc is negligible, according to one European Union expert.  Dr Geoffrey Edwards, director of European Studies at Cambridge University, pointed out that Ireland had undergone significant hardship as a result of the spending cuts and financial reforms demanded by Europe in the wake of Ireland's \u20ac67.5bn bailout in 2010.  Given the difficulties those reforms caused had failed to trigger a referendum on Ireland's future in the EU, he said the EC's decision on Apple would likely have no repercussions for Ireland's continued membership.  \"If the Irish can put up with the Eurozone package they had to suffer, then they can put with this,\" he said.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  The lead sentence of the last paragraph sums it up: \" . . .  the chance of the EC's decision on Apple having any meaningful impact on Ireland's future in the bloc is negligible. . . \""], [691, "2016-08-31T19:18:15Z", [0.07], ""], [368, "2016-08-31T15:19:51Z", [0.0], ""], [26375, "2016-08-31T11:06:47Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-08-30T21:15:28Z", [0.07], ""], [24242, "2016-08-30T18:24:19Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2016-08-30T17:33:59Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2016-08-29T20:50:44Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-08-29T20:03:36Z", [0.07], ""], [18999, "2016-08-29T14:42:56Z", [0.09], ""], [28648, "2016-08-29T08:41:21Z", [0.85], ""], [12591, "2016-08-29T04:32:59Z", [0.03], ""], [6303, "2016-08-28T23:28:17Z", [0.06], "According to the general news and GJP consensus."], [368, "2016-08-28T18:35:02Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-08-28T15:57:00Z", [0.07], ""], [28610, "2016-08-28T14:42:22Z", [1.0], ""], [25791, "2016-08-28T13:53:28Z", [0.01], ""], [28260, "2016-08-28T06:57:46Z", [0.1], ""], [691, "2016-08-27T20:23:07Z", [0.05], ""], [25198, "2016-08-26T20:24:39Z", [0.08], ""], [368, "2016-08-26T17:19:33Z", [0.0], ""], [27874, "2016-08-26T09:02:20Z", [0.03], ""], [691, "2016-08-25T20:14:57Z", [0.05], ""], [368, "2016-08-25T18:07:29Z", [0.0], ""], [28565, "2016-08-25T14:59:07Z", [0.21], ""], [1333, "2016-08-25T14:53:45Z", [0.24], ""], [28558, "2016-08-25T01:49:29Z", [0.29], ""], [691, "2016-08-24T21:36:41Z", [0.05], ""], [28545, "2016-08-24T18:51:50Z", [0.1], ""], [368, "2016-08-24T17:20:42Z", [0.0], ""], [110, "2016-08-24T17:13:44Z", [0.15], "Relatively short timeline.

Yet the reaction to Brexit within the remaining EU states has been almost the exact opposite of a domino effect. Far from encouraging euroskepticism, the victory of the British Leave campaign appears to have boosted the EU\u2019s popularity in other countries. . . .  \"News reports in mid-July noted that soon after the Brexit referendum the polling firm IFOP found public support for the EU had risen in France, Germany, Belgium, Italy and Spain. In Denmark, Finland and the Netherlands, recent polls also have shown marked improvements in the EU\u2019s standing. \"The reason Europeans are reacting in this unexpected way is that Brexit thus far has looked like a mess. The deluge of political casualties that followed  . . . . The new prime minister hasn\u2019t clarified how she intends to handle Britain\u2019s divorce from the EU, and there are reports of disagreements within the new cabinet about when the U.K. should trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, the formal and thus-far untested exit mechanism. \". . .  The appointment of French politician Michel Barnier . . . to be the European Commission\u2019s lead Brexit negotiator is also inauspicious. As in difficult divorces, negotiating positions are moving further apart. An Ipsos poll published Aug. 4 suggested that only 30% of Europeans want to offer Britain favorable terms. \" . . .  While the EU\u2019s growth appears little affected by the victory of Leave, all the data points to what Markit economist Chris Williamson has called a \u201cdramatic deterioration\u201d for the U.K. economy . . .  The only question is how big the hit to investment and consumption is going to be. \"With the U.K. in the grip of so much political and economic uncertainty, no wonder even continental Europe\u2019s more euroskeptical parties aren\u2019t clamoring for referendums of their own. In Spain, parliamentary elections in the wake of the Brexit vote led to better than expected results for the center parties to the detriment of populist Podemos. The Dutch Party for Freedom, led by Geert Wilders, may still lead in the polls, but there is no obligation on the Dutch government to hold a referendum unless there are treaty changes, which no one is seriously contemplating. \"In France, polls point to Marine Le Pen\u2019s defeat in any conceivable runoff for next year\u2019s presidential race. In Austria, extreme right-wing leader Norbert Hofer has a second shot at winning the presidency when the election is rerun on Oct. 2. But he has disowned the idea of leaving the EU. Even Italy\u2019s 5 Star Movement\u2014a favorite boogeyman of eurocritics\u2014fully supports the EU. \"Italy\u2019s Prime Minister Matteo Renzi faces a referendum on his constitutional reform\u2014the deepest since the post-Fascist birth of the republic and one that promises to bolster the stability of future Italian governments. But even there, at worst a referendum defeat could cost a reformist prime minister his job, not lead to \u201cItalexit.\u201d \"If the continental shift away from euroskepticism continues, it significantly reduces the risk that other countries will follow Britain out of the EU.

The Scots' decision to remain a part of the UK following the 2014 referendum was based heavily upon the ideal of maintaining a healthy trade relationship with Europe. England's growing nationalism and subsequent withdrawal from the EU may be perceived, at best, as a direct threat to the Scots' economic interests; at worst, it may cause them to re-evaluate their decision to remain a part of the UK, thus triggering another voter referendum. David Cameron's exit from the PM seat can only aggravate the situation. Cameron's personal reassurances appeared to play a significant role in keeping proud Scots in the fold. Without power to enforce change, it is hard to believe that Cameron's reassurances, if offered, would be met with much credulity. In the end, I strongly believe that the Scots will seize the opportunity to launch another attempt at withdrawal. In my mind, question isn't if, but when the Scots will brave another go. I expect Northern Ireland, desirous of change, will nonetheless take their cue from their Scottish neighbors; I suspect they will wait and watch, as the new PM is seated and act later rather than sooner.

For example, in the UK it was nearly 3 years between the announcement of an intention to hold a referendum and the signing of the legislation, and then another two months after that before a date was set. Those two months could be important given the dutch and french elections in the first half of 2017, even if legislation was passed / decision taken very quickly there are logistical challenges to setting a date. So even if those elections lead to conditions where a referendum will happen, it seems unlikely to me that the date for the referendum would be set by July 1st.  Summary: short time frame; no one (to my knowledge) currently in power in the EU-27 wants to do this; based on UK seems to induce political suicide on the part of everyone involved; Le Pen is even less likely to win campaigning explicitly on a referendum and then even if she does win the conditional probability of *a date being set* by July 1st seems low to me (definitely, definitely <50%).
