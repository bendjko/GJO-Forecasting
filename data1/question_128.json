ENLARGE KIGALI, Rwanda\u2014Lawmakers in Burundi overwhelmingly voted Wednesday in support of a plan to withdraw from the International Criminal Court, something no country has ever done. The decision escalates a bitter dispute with the international community over the human rights situation in the East African country, which has seen more than a year of deadly violence after President Pierre Nkurunziza made a controversial decision to pursue a third term. No state has withdrawn from the ICC, according to the Coalition for the International Criminal Court. The court prosecutes cases of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. Ninety-four out of 110 Burundi lawmakers voted in favor of the withdrawal plan, months after the ICC announced it would investigate the country\u2019s ongoing violence. Some African countries have threatened a withdrawal from the Rome Statute, the treaty that created the ICC, accusing the court of disproportionately targeting the continent. Only Africans have been charged in the six cases that are ongoing or about to begin, though preliminary ICC investigations have been opened elsewhere in the world. Of the 122 countries that are parties to the Rome Statute, 34 are African, the largest continental bloc. The U.S. isn\u2019t a party to the treaty. Burundi\u2019s decision isn\u2019t immediate. Observers say a county wishing to withdraw from the ICC must write to the U.N. secretary-general stating its intention, and the withdrawal takes effect a year after the day the secretary-general receives the letter. Vital Nshimirimana, a Burundian rights activist, urged the U.N. to challenge the government\u2019s decision. \u201cAlready, we have information that intelligence agents are torturing, killing Burundians behind closed doors,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world ought to rescue the people of Burundi.\u201d Burundi\u2019s government has repeatedly said it is the victim of propaganda by exiles and opponents who want to diminish iwho want to diminish its credibility. Hundreds have died in Burundi since Mr. Nkurunziza last year pursued and won a third term that many call unconstitutional. Since the ruling party announced his candidacy in April 2015, Burundi has seen violent street protests, forced disappearances and assassinations. More than 260,000 have fled. On Monday, Burundi\u2019s government banned three U.N. human rights investigators from entering the country following the release of a report that cited massive rights violations allegedly perpetrated by security agencies.\" I  regret not spending more time here. While  I am adopting the crowd view here, in fact genocide has occurred just will probably not be documented. How do you categorize hundreds who have disappeared? Certainly not alive. Now here is the draft summary of the UN report:\n\"This is the final report of the United Nations Independent Investigation on Burundi (UNIIB) established pursuant to Human Rights Council Resolution S-24/1. The report covers violations and abuses of human rights from 15 April 2015 to 30 June 2016. The experts find that gross human rights violations have and are taking place, committed primarily by State agents and those linked to them. These gross violations are systematic and patterned and impunity is pervasive. While the crisis continues and even though the level of overt violence has declined, the overall level of oppression and control over the society has increased, manifested by arbitrary deprivations of life, enforced disappearances coupled with credible allegations of unacknowledged places of detention, in addition to cases of torture, other forms of ill-treatment and arbitrary detention on a massive scale. Freedoms of expression, association and assembly are virtually non-existent. Victims and witnesses are the targets of reprisals. Without determined interventions by the Government of Burundi and a renewed robust engagement by the international community, including the United Nations and the African Union, the country\u2019s downwards spiral is unlikely to be reversed, endangering not only the rights of individuals concerned but also the overall security of the region. The experts cannot exclude that some instances of these gross human rights violations amount to crimes against humanity, and urge for independent international judicial processes to bring the alleged perpetrators to justice\"\n See http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/UNIIB/Pages/UNIIB.aspx and click on final report.\nJust some excerpts from the actual report.\n\"V.\tPrincipal findings\n34.\tNo one can quantify exactly all the violations that have taken place and that continue to take place in a situation as closed and repressive as Burundi during the period covered by UNIIB\u2019s mandate.\n35.\tAccording to some estimates more than one thousand people have been killed as part of the crisis.  Thousands have reportedly been tortured, unknown numbers of women victims of various forms of sexual crimes, hundreds of people disappeared, and thousands illegally detained. \n36.\tA particularly telling figure \u2013 because it can be more easily externally verified \u2013 is the number of people who have fled the country since the crisis began. UNHCR puts the number of people who have sought refuge in neighbouring countries since April 2015 at 286,036 (as of 25 August 2016).  The International Organization for Migration (IOM) reports 109,459 people displaced (as of 31 August 2016).  Clearly many people on the ground believe they see signs of the horrors of the past repeating itself and flee.\n37.\tThe experts provide below an overview of some of the violations that have been investigated by UNIIB. \nA.\tArbitrary deprivations of life\n38.\tNo official figures of the number of people killed during the crisis are available, and the system of accountability is virtually non-existent. OHCHR has informed UNIIB that, as of 30 August 2016, it has verified 564 cases of executions since 26 April 2015. Given the constraints under which OHCHR operate this is clearly a conservative estimate. \n39.\tUNIIB found that the large majority of victims have been identified as people who were opposed or perceived to be opposed to the third mandate of President Nkurunziza or of members of opposition parties.\n1.\tExecutions committed by the security forces and those who work with them\n40.\tThe information received and verified by UNIIB supports the conclusion that executions have been committed on a large sale by the security forces, often supported by the Imbonerakure. From among the many testimonies UNIIB heard, we highlight the following examples.\n41.\tOn the morning of 26 April 2015 16-year old Jean N\u00e9po was returning from Sunday Mass in St. Joseph Church, Bujumbura. Near the University Porte d\u2019Afrique, he met demonstrators chanting slogans against the third term of the President. The police dispersed the demonstrators who were throwing stones. According to witnesses, a police commissioner ordered one of his officers to kill Jean N\u00e9po who had remained at the scene while the crowd had dispersed. Jean N\u00e9po reportedly begged the police to let him live, saying, \u201cI could be your child. I beg you. Save me.\u201d As the officer hesitated, the commissioner pulled out his gun and shot the young man twice in the head. No investigation has been initiated by the authorities into the case.\n42.\tUNIIB received first-hand information confirming the involvement of the Imbonerakure in murders of perceived opposition sympathizers. Thus, a former member of the Imbonerakure testified to UNIIB that he had participated in the killing of 20 individuals in Bujumbura, including two Imbonerakure who had warned persons that there were plans to execute them. The witness added that the Imbonerakure were expected to arrest all those who opposed the third mandate, were against the President, or who did not collaborate with the CNDD-FDD. The bodies of those executed in the cases mentioned were reportedly placed in bags, transported across the Ruzizi River using makeshift boats, and buried in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. \n43.\tThe attacks of 11 December 2015 by armed groups on four military camps, three in Bujumbura and one in the province of Bujumbura Rural, were followed by operations during which security forces allegedly committed massive violations of human rights, notably a high number of extra-judicial executions of youths. UNIIB received testimonies confirming such extra-judicial executions and indicating that the official number of 87 killed during these two days is very conservative.  \n2.\tReports of mass graves\n44.\tAllegations of mass burials of those executed during these incidents have been widely reported.  Initial satellite imagery suggests that bodies may have been buried in mass graves during this period, including in Bujumbura (in Kanyosha and Mpanda) and Bubanza. UNIIB received testimony corroborating the existence of mass graves.  Reported intimidation by members of the Imbonerakure and SNR of persons in possession of information on this topic give further credibility to the testimony. \n45.\tThe proper forensic examination of alleged mass graves calls for specialised expertise. In the meantime, the sites concerned must be left undisturbed. UNIIB offered to arrange for the alleged sites to be properly recorded, so that it can be investigated in full at a later stage, but the Government has not responded to the offer.\"\n.\tTargeted assassinations\n46.\tA former senior officer of the National Defence Force confirmed to UNIIB the existence of several lists of people, including civilians and military, to be eliminated by the security forces. \n47.\tArmed elements in opposition to the Government have also been involved in several murders, notably targeted assassinations. UNIIB documented a case where a member of the Imbonerakure was burnt alive. Grenade attacks have also allegedly been carried out by these armed elements, causing casualties among the population. From May 2015 to February 2016, OHCHR Burundi documented several cases of grenades thrown by unknown individuals in public places, mainly in Bujumbura. \n48.\tApparent examples of tit-for-tat targeted assassinations within the Army \u2013 particularly threatening to the integration of the armed forces \u2013 include the killings of several senior Army officers belonging either to the pre-Arusha Agreement Burundian Armed Forces (ex-FAB) or to the former rebel group \u201cArmed Political Parties and Movements\u201d (ex-PMPA) and the apparent retaliatory killings of alleged supporters of the regime within the forces. Among the most emblematic examples are the killings of General Adolphe Nshimirimana on 2 August 2015; General Karakuza on 25 April 2016; and Colonel Darius Ikurakure on 22 March 2016. The latter was shot dead in the compound of the headquarters of the Army Joint Staff. \n49.\tHuman rights activists, as well as their relatives, have been primary targets. For instance, on 3 August 2015 Pierre Claver Mbonimpa, a leading human rights activist and representative of the Association for the protection of human rights and of detainees (APRODH), was shot in the cheek and arm during an apparent assassination attempt. On 6 August 2015, his son, Welly Fleury Nzitonda, was arrested. He was later killed in the Mutakura neighbourhood of Bujumbura. On 9 October 2015, Mr. Mbonimpa\u2019s son-in-law, Pascal Nshimirimana, was killed by firearm and grenades as he was returning home in Ngangara.  \nB.\tEnforced disappearances\n50.\tMany persons have disappeared since the beginning of the crisis, often following their arbitrary arrest by security forces, notably the Police and the SNR. The victims include opposition members, civil society members and demonstrators. UNIIB met relatives of people arrested by elements of the security forces who were never seen again. They were unable to obtain any information from the authorities regarding the fate or whereabouts of the person concerned.\n51.\tMarie-Claudette Kwizera, Treasurer of the CSO Ligue ITEKA was allegedly arrested on 10 December 2015 by the SNR and has not been seen since. More recently, on 22 July 2016, Jean Birgimana, journalist at Iwaku newspaper, was also allegedly arrested by the SNR and is missing since then.\n52.\tMoreover, UNIIB received information and names from witnesses concerning the existence of a group of twelve well-known SNR, police, and military agents who have allegedly been responsible for many cases of enforced disappearances, and who report directly to the inner circle of the Executive.\"  So combine the vote to leave ICC, the exclusion of the UN Human RIghts Rapporteurs, and the unexcavated mass graves:\nlead me to conclude that  the nunber killed by security forces is well in excess of 1000 in 2016 and the violence seems about to be renewed. This country along with Nigeria may not reach the technical definition, but these UN findings might trigger some re:evaluations from the expert panel.\nSomehow reports of  mass killngs in sub-Saharan Africa never seem to appear in the US  on cable news.\nThere  is a more profitable circus to follow  in the US, the 2016 election.

A delegation of Burundian officials had arrived in Kigali Rwanda to attend the summit but left on July 13, two days after the meetings preceding the Heads of State Summit had begun. There were no reasons given and the matter was not discussed during the summit. In a press briefing on Tuesday, Burundi's Foreign Minister Alain Aime Nyamitwe said that Burundi's delegation withdrew after it was not accorded 'security guarantees' and also due to the AU's failure to address Burundi's complaints on Rwanda. Burundi and Rwanda remain at loggerheads over Bujumbura's accusations that Kigali is backing rebels fighting President Nkurunziza, accusations Rwanda vehemently denies. Burundi's withdrawal was marred by the assassination of former Burundian minister and member of the East African Legislative Assembly (EALA) Hafsa Mossi who was gunned down by unknown people in Bujumbura. Rwanda's Minister of Foreign Affairs Louise Mushikiwabo said on Tuesday that Burundi's withdrawal was regrettable but said the Bujumbura is better positioned to explain why they left. Very unfortunate \"It is very unfortunate that Burundi missed this very important summit. We are aware that a delegation from Burundi was there during the initial stages of the meeting but they went back. Up to now we don't know the reasons behind that decision,\" President Pierre Nkurunziza was not among the 35 African leaders who attended the summit in Rwanda despite the Burundi crisis emerging among the topics discussed during the continental meet. \"We regret the fact that the African Union has kept silent on the complaints of the Burundian Government about Rwanda destabilising Burundi,\" Mr Nyamitwe said. AU chairperson Dlamini-Zuma further commended the efforts deployed by Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, East African Community Mediator, with the support of former President Mkapa Benjamin, to facilitate the ongoing Inter-Burundian Dialogue. Mr Mkapa was in Kigali to brief Heads of States on the progress on peace talks, though little progress has been made in Arusha, with the government rejecting some parties involved in the talks. Burundi's Foreign Affair's Minister reiterated that his country will not hold talks with \"terrorists\".

But human-rights organisations believe it is a \"false calm\" in which violence could erupt at any time due to the economic slowdown and ethnic tensions. They say the country is governed through repression that is hidden from the public eye. The Intra-Burundi Dialogue resumed in Arusha on Tuesday, but representatives of five parties that participated in Burundi's general election boycotted the second round of peace talks facilitated by former Tanzanian president Benjamin Mkapa. The government officials walked out protesting the presence of some participants they accuse of planning to overthrow President Pierre Nkurunziza's regime. Mr Mkapa had travelled to Belgium to meet key opposition stakeholders in an effort to end to the crisis that has rocked the country for more than a year. But this did not go down well with the government, which maintains that it will not negotiate with those who organised the failed coup last year. \"The long awaited truth will not come from Arusha, because the dialogue outside the country is for selfish politicians,\" said Jelase Ndabirabe, spokesman for the ruling party CNDD-FDD. However, members of civil society criticised the government's rigid stand on the talks. \"It is not for the government to refuse to dialogue with people who are opposed to its policies. Dialogue is normally with those you have a disagreement with, and not your allies,\" said Gabriel Rufyiri, a civil society leader. As the dialogue stalled last week, Burundi's Foreign Affairs Minister Alain Nyamitwe said the main issues to be discussed in the Intra-Burundi Dialogue are the return of refugees and preparations for the 2020 elections, adding that the government does not recognise the opposition in exile. On July 7, Human Rights Watch released a report accusing Burundi intelligence services of torturing opponents, at their headquarters and in secret locations. \"The Burundian intelligence services have a long history of torture, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detention, and other human-rights abuses against suspected government opponents, going back many years.

Human rights and aid experts painted a chilling picture of a state ruled by fear, where authorities have become increasingly sophisticated in concealing repression and where high inflation, flooding linked to El Ni\u00f1o, and the political crisis have conspired to make it harder than ever for most people to make ends meet. During its session on Burundi, the International Development Committee (IDC) heard that the UK\u2019s priorities include supporting hobbled peace talks in Tanzania and pushing at the UN for the deployment of an international police contingent. In April last year, President Pierre Nkurunziza declared he would stand for a third term, triggering street protests, a failed coup and months of terror during which, human rights activists say, scores were killed or abducted and tortured by intelligence services. More than 285,000 people have fled to neighbouring countries.  On Wednesday, a former government minister and BBC journalist, Hafsa Mossi, was shot dead in Burundi\u2019s capital, Bujumbura, by unknown gunmen \u2013 the latest in a series of apparently politically motivated assassinations. Nkurunziza said the murder was a \u201cvile and cowardly act\u201d. In her testimony, Carina Tertsakian, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch, said: \u201cThe government of Burundi has shown no sign of relenting and the repression towards anyone suspected of being an opponent or critic is absolutely brutal,\u201d citing a recent HRW report. \u201cSome of the torture techniques that we have documented are so vicious it\u2019s unbelievable that anyone survives: for example, intelligence agents use metal bars, hammers to smash people\u2019s bones, to smash their jaws, pulling out their teeth with pliers, tying ropes to the genitals of male detainees and pulling them, and other acts of torture that are just horrific. For these abuses, there is complete impunity,\u201d she said. Richard Moncrieff, project director for central Africa at the International Crisis Group, said Nkurunziza\u2019s government had become increasingly radicalised while stop-start peace talks were unlikely to succeed, not least because of the fragmentation of the opposition. \u201cI would describe the situation as a fake calm,\u201d Moncrieff told the panel of MPs, describing a toxic \u201cethnicisation from above\u201d that he said had yet to take hold in the general public or in the army but was present at the top levels of government, and among the ruling party\u2019s armed youth wing, the Imbonerakure. Although this latest crisis is political in origin, there is concern it could revive the divisions of a 12-year internal conflict, during which 300,000 people were killed as Hutus rebelled against the Tutsi-dominated armed forces. \u201cThe regime is trying to push the ethnic card to shore up its support among its core supporters, its Hutu supporters but also in the security forces \u2026 All the evidence shows that the general population is quite resistant to that \u2026 But we see that the police and \u2026 the Imbonerakure are clearly using ethnic rhetoric \u2026 we see top levels of government continuing to use very unpleasant ethnic rhetoric,\u201d Moncrieff said. \u201cThis poses a very serious threat to long-term social cohesion and an immediate threat to the stability of the country \u2026 because the poisoning of the atmosphere in this way, when it enters the security forces and informal militia \u2026 can have catastrophic consequences.\u201d In January, the UN warned that \u201ca complete breakdown of law and order is just around the corner\u201d and said it was investigating allegations of gang-rapes, enforced disappearances and the digging of mass graves during an eruption of violence last December. Nick Hurd, Britain\u2019s minister for international development, said the UK government was putting diplomatic pressure on players to attend peace talks. \u201cThere\u2019s a process under way that is frustrating and slow. We\u2019re a player in that and also through the UN, we\u2019re working those channels to keep the focus on this situation, not least to get agreement on the police contingent we\u2019d like to see deployed,\u201d Hurd said, adding that one problem was the need for approval from Burundi\u2019s government, which reportedly opposes the UN deployment. Benjamin Chemouni, of the London School of Economics, said Nkurunziza\u2019s administration was becoming more professional in its repression. \u201cThey are much better in targeting people and doing that behind closed doors,\u201d he said. In June, Zeid Ra\u2019ad al Hussein, the UN high commissioner for human rights, said there had been at least 348 extrajudicial killings in the year to April, and he spoke of a climate of fear. There are reports (pdf) that Burundians are being recruited in refugee camps in Rwanda to join anti-government militias. \u201cIf Rwanda is training people in camps, that would give the regime in Bujumbura a reason to say, \u2018Look, these people are just puppets of a Tutsi government\u2019, and then it would give them a base for having this inflammatory rhetoric of ethnicity,\u201d Chemouni said. Hurd said: \u201cWe have sent very clear signals to Rwanda that we want their interventions in this situation to be constructive.\u201d The expert panel called for sanctions on hate speech, an international inquiry into crimes, the deployment of the police contingent and greater support from donors. The IDC\u2019s chair, Stephen Twigg, said strong action was needed from bilateral partners, including the African Union and the UN, to prevent further violence, adding: \u201cWe must not let this quiet crisis fall off the international agenda.\u201d"], [783, "2016-07-14T07:58:54Z", [0.74], "Burundi crisis: MP Hafsa Mossi shot dead in Bujumbura\nhttp://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-36783069 A former government minister has been shot dead in the Burundi capital, Bujumbura by unknown gunmen.\nHafsa Mossi was an MP in the East African parliament and a former BBC Swahili service journalist.\nPresident Pierre Nkurunziza called it an assassination, and a vile and cowardly act.\nThere has been an increase in violence in Burundi since Mr Nkurunziza declared last year that he would run for a controversial third term.\nThe killing comes as the latest talks aimed at resolving the Burundi conflict hit a snag in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha.\nGovernment officials rejected the presence of members of the opposition effectively stopping the resumption of the negotiations\nOfficials have said Ms Mossi was \"shot by criminals\".\nThe BBC's Ismail Misigaro in Bujumbura reports that her body has been taken to the military hospital in the city."], [556, "2016-07-13T22:17:57Z", [0.45], "http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/burundian-regional-parlia/2954520.html My forecast has come down, not because I don't think a mass killing is going on.

Four other civilians were wounded in the blast in the northern town of Ngozi, a stronghold district of President Pierre Nkurunziza. \"He removed the pin from one of two grenades, but it exploded in his hands and killed him on the spot as well as the bicycle taxi driver transporting him,\" said local government officer Radjabu Songambere. Another man later died of his wounds in hospital. \"Everything indicates that the soldier wanted to carry out an attack,\" Songambere said. The Ngozi region, about 130km north of the capital Bujumbura, has largely escaped over a year of violence since April 2015, when Nkurunziza launched his controversial and succesful third term bid - sparking street protests, a failed coup and a nascent rebellion.

However, UNSC passed a resolution in April that urges an end to the violence, encourages inclusive dialogue, etc.  Also wants UN police options in case violence continues.  http://www.un.org/press/en/2016/sc12315.doc.htm 3.  Peace talks are not progressing well but at least one side, the government, showed up for the latest round.  That is improvement.  Key opposition leaders were not invited.  \nhttp://www.trtworld.com/mea/burundi-peace-talks-resume-in-tanzania-without-opposition-111095 4.  AU concluded their report on the Burundi situation in May and called for an international police deployment.   I found the following passage related to the investigation relevant:  \"The [AU] report was based on a week-long visit to the country in December 2015.  During the investigation, delegates from the African Union were given limited access by Burundian forces due to \"an eruption of major fighting\" in the capital Bujumbura.\"  http://www.trtworld.com/mea/au-calls-for-intl-police-to-be-deployed-into-burundi-109870 These investigations take a long time and Burundi has so far limited where the AU investigators can go.  There may have been good reasons to do that but the AU investigators were still denied full access.  \n\n5.

The schoolchildren, aged between 12 and 17-years-old, were marching on the highway between Bujumbura and Gitega. \"We were in the streets to ask for the release of our colleagues who were unjustly arrested, then some police officers who were in a pick-up vehicle of the intelligence office opened fire on us, a colleague was hurt by one bullet and was taken to hospital for treatment,\" one student told Reuters.

Burundi\u2019s peace talks going nowhere\nhttps://www.irinnews.org/analysis/2016/05/24/burundi\u2019s-peace-talks-going-nowhere The purpose of peace talks is to engage your opponent across the negotiating table. But the Burundi government sees things differently and by picking and choosing who it talks to, on Tuesday sank the latest mediation effort to resolve the country\u2019s political crisis. Four days of an \u201cinter-Burundi dialogue\u201d, mediated by former Tanzanian president Benjamin Mkapa, has been labeled a \u201cmonologue\u201d by the opposition. They are furious over the government\u2019s decision to reject talking to key members of the umbrella National Council for the Restoration of Arusha Agreement and Rule of Law \u2013 known by the French acronym \u201cCNARED\u201d. The government of President Pierre Nkurunziza has been steadfast in its refusal to talk with opponents implicated in a coup attempt last year aimed at stopping his bid for a third-term in office. Instead the 21 to 24 May \u201cdialogue\u201d in Arusha, Tanzania, featured only government officials, two former heads of state, and a selection of like-minded individuals. In a limp statement on Sunday, Mkapa\u2019s office regretted the absence of key opposition figures, and said Mkapa would \u201cmeet all the stakeholders who were invited to attend the Arusha dialogue and were not able to come due to various reasons \u2026 in due course.\u201d Some members of the CNARED alliance had been invited to Arusha. But it was in their private capacity, not as representatives of the body, which is recognized by the African Union and the East African Community as the legitimate voice of the opposition. \u201cThe negotiations that exclude the real stakeholders in the crisis, including CNARED, civil society, armed movements, religious representatives, media, women and youth are a waste of time,\u201d said a CNARED statement. \u201cThose who have gone to Arusha know themselves, they have no atom of [a] solution to the crisis that [has] rocked Burundi.\u201d The humanitarian fallout The UN estimates that at least 474 people have died as a result of political violence since April last year. More than 79,000 people have been internally displaced and 250,000 have fled the country. The crisis has crippled Burundi\u2019s economy, worsening already poor development indicators. CNARED insists it will not accept any post-crisis arrangement that allows Nkurunziza to stay in office. They argue that his third-term bid was prohibited by the constitution and also violated the 2000 Arusha peace accord that ended Burundi\u2019s decade-long civil war. But in a controversial ruling the courts allowed Nkurunziza to stand, and he went on to easily win elections in July 2015. \u201cFor the government, allowing CNARED to participate in the dialogue without changing its position on the future of Nkurunziza is seen as an early capitulation that could have serious consequences on the future of the ruling party,\u201d said Reverien Mfizi, a doctoral candidate in political science at the State University of New York. \u201cAs long as the opposition maintains that position, we are not likely to see the government changing its position on the inclusion [in talks] of coup plotters and opposition armed groups,\u201d he told IRIN. But without the participation of all parties to the negotiations, including armed groups involved in attacks on the security forces and government officials, a political solution to end the 13-month conflict is unlikely, analysts warn. \u201cTensions on the ground are escalating. Government raids on opposition neighborhoods and abductions (often of relatives of members of civil society or opposition groups) continue,\u201d said Joseph Siegel of the Africa Centre for Strategic Studies at the National Defense University in Washington DC.\n\u201cGiven these actions and the perceived futility of negotiations, a growing number of Burundians are of the mind that change will only come through armed opposition,\u201d he told IRIN. \u201cThe situation in Burundi demands a more urgent response,\u201d said Carina Tertsakian, Human Rights Watch\u2019s senior researcher for Burundi and Rwanda. \u201cThe most urgent thing is for parties to put pressure on the Burundian government to take concrete measures to stop the killings and other abuses \u2013 immediately.\u201d The International Criminal Court has opened a preliminary investigation into the allegations of gross human rights, including torture, rape and disappearances.\nCNARED's participation has been a longstanding sticking point for the East African Community-mediated talks, both back when Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni was facilitator and now under the direction of Mkapa. But given the implacability of the Burundi government, the former Tanzanian leader may have had no option at the moment but to meet CNARED separately in the search for common ground. No leverage? \u201cThe problem is that the [African Union] and international community more broadly, has little leverage over Nkurunziza in pressuring his government to include CNARED absent the credible threat of sanctions or intervention,\u201d said Alex Fielding, senior analyst at Max Security Solutions, a geopolitical risk consulting firm.\n\u201cNkurunziza called the AU's bluff back in December when the regional bloc resolved to intervene militarily with or without consent, correctly predicting that neither the AU leaders nor the UN Security Council had the political will to intervene militarily against a hostile Burundi,\u201d he told IRIN. \u201cOne has to remember how difficult it was for the region to bring the CNDDFDD [Nkurunziza\u2019s party], then a rebel group, to the negotiating table in the nineties to understand that the situation requires a whole new level of intervention,\u201d Carine Kaneza, spokesperson for the Women and Girls Movement for Peace and Security in Burundi, told IRIN. \u201cIf CNDDFDD was resilient and defiant [then] \u2026 what will it take today when they control all national instruments of state power?\u201d The Arusha Accords, a power-sharing arrangement that merged the army with rebel forces, remains the reference point for a political solution today.\n\u201cNkurunziza must consider political concessions - such as increasing the power of opposition parties over key decision-making areas - that will appease the protesters,\u201d said Phil Clark, a Great Lakes expert at the School of Oriental and African Affairs, University of London. \u201cGiven that Nkurunziza will continue refusing to step down, he must find other ways to respond to protesters' demands, including on ceasing daily violations against citizens, tackling state corruption and delivering development in the Burundian countryside,\u201d he told IRIN. To bring that about, how willing is the international community to consider more robust measures? \nThe deployment of a UN police force to protect civilians has been among the options the UN Security Council has been considering since April. So far, Burundi has opposed anything beyond 20 unarmed police advisers. \u201cThe only feasible solution involves the government agreeing to an external observer mission that ensures an end to the government's violations - including killings - against opposition leaders and supporters. That must be the first process put in place,\u201d Clark told IRIN.\nFor now, the likelihood of Bujumbura voluntarily agreeing to that remains remote."], [1693, "2016-05-29T01:40:14Z", [0.1], ""], [241, "2016-05-28T23:00:59Z", [0.45], ""], [368, "2016-05-28T20:58:38Z", [0.2], ""], [691, "2016-05-28T13:48:14Z", [0.52], ""], [4729, "2016-05-28T06:00:37Z", [0.45], ""], [10759, "2016-05-28T05:33:23Z", [0.25], ""], [4634, "2016-05-28T05:33:16Z", [0.25], ""], [13377, "2016-05-28T03:00:38Z", [0.2], ""], [532, "2016-05-28T02:10:09Z", [0.3], ""], [783, "2016-05-27T21:24:31Z", [0.75], "Updated, but not score.  Burundi A forgotten country painted in blood\nwww.heraldscotland.com/news/14493657.Burundi_A_forgotten_country_painted_in_blood  Abdul Yamuremye almost left it too late. For months, friends and neighbours had been packing up and fleeing, driven from their homes as the attacks by the men with the guns and the machetes became more brutal and more random. Yamuremye had spent years building a successful scrap metal business in Burundi's capital, Bujumbura. He knew that when people ran before when political crisis in the country turned to bloodshed, all their assets and land were looted. He was determined to do all he could to avoid that.   But then, the Thursday before Easter, the men with the guns and machetes arrived at his door and it became clear it was time for him to run, too. Within minutes, his two teenage brothers, a friend who lived with them, and her son and two daughters including one still a toddler were dead. His house, he said, was 'painted in blood'. It is a year since Burundi's political crisis erupted, sparked by President Pierre Nkurunziza's decision to run for election again despite already having served his constitutionally-mandated two terms in office. His move sparked street protests then deadly security crackdowns. More than 3,400 people have been detained and more than 400 have died, the UN estimates. It is a common story in the young democracies of Central Africa: Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Republic of Congo, and Uganda all have leaders in place who have already over-run their tenure, or are set to. What is not so common is what happened in Burundi once the world's attention moved on from the initial clashes a year ago. In the first surge of violence, the ruling party unleashed its thuggish youth wing, the Imbonerakure, whose armed members swept the country hunting opponents. That wave of terror spawned reprisal vigilante gangs opposed to the president, who retaliated. Amid the chaos, opportunistic criminals seized their chances. Burundi's demography of Hutu and Tutsi tribes matches neighbouring Rwanda's, deepening worries in a region still reeling from the echoes of the 1994 genocide, and where Burundi itself only emerged from ethnic civil conflict in 2005. Regional efforts again to broker peace between Nkurunziza and his opponents are stalled. Today, Burundi's borders are effectively closed, domestic news outlets shuttered, and the few foreign reporters who make it into the country face arrest or deportation. In the first months of the crisis last summer, close to a quarter of a million Burundians fled to neighbouring countries, most of them to Tanzania, where 137,000 are now refugees. The number of people leaving Burundi has slowed to roughly 280 a day since the start of 2016, less than a tenth of the numbers fleeing a year ago. But that trickle of refugees carries with them the freshest accounts of what life is like inside Burundi today, and they often directly contradict the international assumption that because the street protests are over, the crisis is over. The Sunday Herald, working with UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, spent a week talking to Burundian refugees who recently arrived to camps in western Tanzania. The picture they paint is one of a new normal of seemingly endless casual brutality, where there is no apparent logic governing who falls victim: those who oppose the ruling party, and those who support it; young men, and old women; landowners, and the penniless who cannot pay; the well-schooled, and the uneducated. \"I am just a businessman, I never wanted to be involved in politics,\" says Yamuremye, 32, the scrap-metal dealer from Bujumbura. \"Maybe that was the reason they came for us: I did not belong to the ruling party. I have heard that is why people are killed.\"\n He was walking home that Thursday at the end of March after an outing with his family: his wife, Hadija, 25, and their six-year-old son and infant daughter. Friends intercepted him on the road. Don't go home, they said. Men with guns are there. They spent that night at a mosque. \"Sleep was not possible. All I kept thinking was that I hoped everyone at home had managed to escape, that they were alive,\" Yamuremye said. \"Instead, when I ventured there the next day, it was the complete opposite.\" In the kitchen he found the body of the friend who lived with them, killed as she cooked dinner \u2013 beans, rice, chips \u2013 and prepared to take it to the others. \"There was blood everywhere, but otherwise it was as it should be, the food, the pots, the tray,\" Yamuremye said. In the sitting room, the friend's seven-year-old son lay riddled with gunshots, beside Yamuremye's brothers, aged 15 and 19, who were machine-gunned as they watched television. \"There were probably watching football,\" Yamuremye said. \"They loved football.\" Outside were the bodies of the friend's two daughters, one just turned 10, the other a two-year-old. No-one was spared. His home was looted, his savings stolen. \"There had been lots of strange boys around the neighbourhood,\" he said, talking from his new home, a plastic tent in a refugee camp. \"They looked at me, then they rubbed their hands together like they were pretending to wash clothes. They said, we're going to clean you from this place like this.\"   Nolasque Nduwimana, a 31-year-old history teacher at a girls' Catholic boarding school, knows why the gunmen came for him. \"Yes, I supported the opposition,\" he said. \"Why should that mean I should be killed?\" Friends warned him his name was top of a hit list drawn up at local ruling party committee meetings. He planned to leave, but wanted to complete marking his students' exams first. Like Yamuremye, he almost left it too late. On Easter Friday, close to midnight, five men broke into his room, forced him to the floor, pointed two machine guns at his head, and were told, \"shoot him\". In that moment, another teacher in a room down the corridor called out and distracted the gunmen. Nduwimana took the split second chance to save his life, and fled, barefoot, in his pyjamas, grabbing his spectacles from the nightstand as he leapt through the shower-room window and ran. A bookish man more used to libraries than forests, he spent three days sleeping rough and moving slowly to the border under cover of night. Disguised as a priest \u2013 \"the Church is all the militia respect any more,\" he said \u2013 he slipped into Tanzania. For the first days in a refugee camp here, he refused to leave his tent. Even now, his lips stiffen as he talks - trying not to break down. This camp is too close to Burundi, he says. He wants to be moved further away. \"People can find me here,\" he said, as his lips again tightened.   Another man, a student who gave his name as Ernest, told how someone threw a grenade into his family home at the start of March, probably because his father could not pay thugs who circled his neighbourhood extorting residents under the guise of collecting ruling party membership dues. His parents, three sisters, and a brother were all killed. They had been planning to leave, but left it too late. \"Injustice - that is all that thrives in my country today,\" he said. Sabine, a grandmother in her 50s who asked that her real name not be published, knows her husband, a local community leader, was killed because he was \"loyal, and spoke up against injustice\". She had to flee and could not bury him. \"I have nightmares - the dogs ate his body,\" she said. All of these survivors' mental scars are fresh, and need urgent attention. UNHCR, working with the Tanzanian government and other aid agencies, is providing basic counselling and psychosocial support to refugees, but needs more help. \"The problem is that our donor appeal is so overwhelmingly underfunded that we are only barely able to provide shelter, household items, latrines, showers, I'm talking about the very basics,\" said Dost Yousafzai, the head of UNHCR's sub-office in the Tanzanian town of Kibondo, 30 miles from the Burundian border and close to the refugee camps. UNHCR needs \u00a3218 million to respond to the Burundi refugee crisis across central Africa but donors including the British Government have so far offered only GBP32 million, less than one in every seven pounds needed. \"With that level of support,\" Yousafzai continued, \"it's things like counselling for people who have survived horrific experiences, or education for children, or care for the disabled and the elderly, or protecting the environment around the camps, which very sadly fall by the way side.\" Amid the apparently random violence described by the refugees, one sinister trend emerged: rampant sexual violence, perpetrated mostly against women, but also men. Rape is being used as a punishment at checkpoints in Burundi and at its borders, according to survivors who said they were targeted for associating with the wrong political party, or because of their background or the place they came from. Nicole, a mother with three young sons, almost made it to the border but was stopped and thrown into a detention centre with dozens of others, where many were assaulted or tortured. She was put in solitary confinement, where she was beaten unconscious then came to with a policeman raping her. \"I was shouting and struggling, but he did what he wanted,\u201d she said, her trembling fingers struggling to catch the tears that rolled down her cheeks. She recalled other officers passing by and walking away. When he was finished, the policeman threw her out of the building. She has not seen her boys since. Men are also being sexually attacked, a rarity even for the brutal wars of this region. One, a student who gave his name as David, said he was singled out by classmates because he refused to join the Imbonerakure. He was abducted, handcuffed, and repeatedly raped while other men watched. \u201cThey would say, \u2018you won't join us, so we will show no forgiveness\u2019,\u201d he said. Eventually, he escaped. Another 36-year-old man was held for a month and is now impotent after he was repeatedly sexually tortured and beaten in the groin, again because he refused to join the militia. Renate Frech, a senior protection officer for UNHCR working in the camps, said the reported sexual violence cases might be \"a small number of the reality,\u201d particularly for men. Many reported sexual or domestic violence cases took place after refugees arrived to the camps: the International Rescue Committee, which works with UNHCR in Tanzania, has helped 1,759 survivors of sexual and gender-based violence that happened after they left Burundi. Numbers of those attacked inside their country are impossible to quantify. Again, with limited international funding to help Burundi's refugees, services to survivors of sexual violence are restricted. Ernest, the refugee whose family was killed with a grenade, says his country's plight has largely been forgotten. \"The world needs to be closer to the people of Burundi, especially those who are still inside the country,\" he says. \"People are dying today, and they will die tomorrow.\" "], [368, "2016-05-27T20:26:29Z", [0.2], ""], [14613, "2016-05-27T19:05:22Z", [0.05], ""], [23117, "2016-05-27T15:39:52Z", [0.88], ""], [24159, "2016-05-27T12:20:01Z", [0.25], ""], [18995, "2016-05-27T10:59:34Z", [0.47], "Time is passing and nothing has pushed things up for me, so I have to lower the chances."], [67, "2016-05-27T03:17:01Z", [0.3], ""], [368, "2016-05-26T20:48:28Z", [0.2], ""], [691, "2016-05-26T18:40:26Z", [0.55], ""], [783, "2016-05-26T06:47:54Z", [0.75], "Further events will make Burundi government ignore peace talks.

At the same time Pierre Nkurunziza was going for his third term last year Burundi on 29 April 2015 issued a statement that the Burundi currency will be replaced by a new currency and all old currency will lose legal tender status soon after. I really thought this was interesting. I was in Iraq in 2004 when the CPA replaced the old Iraqi Dinar with a new Iraqi Dinar. People with Dinar had to exchange the old Dinar for new Dinar within a time period just like Burundi last year. Let your imagination run wild who may have hoarded the old Dinar. With any nation takeover a form of economics must be planned for. That means a form of exchange; paper currency, coins, gold, labor, whatever. In the case of modern economics and finance currency is a favorite.  It took a bit of researching but I think http://securamonde.com/ (Secura Monde International \"SMI\") made Burundi's new currency which is located right outside of London England.  A western nation company seems to have supported Pierre Nkurunziza third term for President of Burundi.  I wonder if part of the reason refugees left Burundi for other nations is because they could not exchange their currency secondary to ethnic discrimination.  If this is the case I suspect deaths will be less common going forward. http://securamonde.com/news-2/banknotes/burundi-issues-new-banknotes/ \"on 29 April 2015 the Bank of the Republic of Burundi introduced a new family of banknotes consisting of denominations of 500, 2,000, 5,000 and 10,000 francs.

It looks like, on a year over year basis, fatalities per week has actually decreased. So, if you take 690 as where we are over last year, then simply by rolling the year period forward each month the total death count will decrease. That means we will need to see another massive spike to account for the relative decrease (in order to hit the 1,000)*. However, \"Rates of civilian targeting have increased since the beginning of 2016 and most of the fatalities from this conflict (approximately 60%) have been borne by the civilian population.\"  That said, a lot can happen between now and end of the year. Kabila's reelection in neighboring DRC could have an impact on ethnic tensions in neighboring countries, as it has in the past. The UN could find a way to get examiners into Burundi (I'd say \nunlikely), which could find mass graves that drastically increase the count (https://www.yahoo.com/news/un-wants-send-experts-burundi-mass-graves-probe-223656530.html?ref=gs). All that said, I'm actually going to decrease my % somewhat, b/c the ACLED report was new information to me and I hadn't realized that much of the existing 690 deaths (over trailing year) had occurred in a single week in Dec-2015 and that the year-over-year weekly death rate has been decreasing since then.

And when they take a suspect away, the terrified family members left behind just hope their relative will be held at a known jail. That's because unofficial cells have reportedly become death chambers in the months since President Pierre Nkurunziza won a disputed third term. Amid the violence, in which more than 400 people have been killed since last April, an online network of Burundian activists is trying to bring international attention to what it says are rising incidents of people being disappeared by local police and intelligence agents, some of whom then return to extort huge sums of money from families desperate to get their loved ones back. The group, iBurundi, has almost 11,000 followers on Twitter. Members are mostly young professionals including journalists, lawyers, economists and policy analysts, and also some students belong, a member told The Associated Press. He insisted on anonymity because of safety concerns. The group is urging U.N. rights investigators to look into unofficial jails across Burundi where detainees are allegedly tortured and killed, he said. \"We have not been counting all the disappearances but they number in (the) hundreds,\" he said. \"Just in the last two weeks, we know of 26 reported cases. Some of these individuals were later found to be in known jails, others are missing.\" Amounts between $250 and $2,500 are demanded from families hoping to secure the freedom of a detained family member, according to the group, which in Twitter updates has been posting names of individuals believed to be missing after they were arrested by security agents. The Burundian government has repeatedly denied it tortures and kills civilians, although Nkurunziza urged the security forces to use all means necessary to end the violence which started a year ago when civilians took to the streets to protest his decision to serve beyond two terms. In a disarmament operation in some neighborhoods seen as anti-government, such as Musaga and Nyakabiga in the capital Bujumbura, the number of people fleeing Burundi topped 250,000 in March, according to U.N. figures. Rights groups worry the number of disappearances and extrajudicial killings may be rising as the government tries to put down dissenters as well as at least two rebel groups that have recently launched attacks. \"Typically people are taken away by members of the police or intelligence services, led to unknown destinations, then no one hears anything more about them,\" said Carina Tertsakian, the Burundi researcher for Human Rights Watch. Some military officials seen as close to the president have been targeted for assassination \u2014 including even the army chief, who survived a rocket attack last year \u2014 raising the prospect of revenge attacks. Some detainees may be held in unofficial detention centers run by the intelligence agency, known as SNR, and others may have been killed, their bodies never found, Tertsakian said. Some Burundians whose relatives have disappeared say members of a pro-government militia group called the Imbonerakure are responsible in some cases. Amnesty International reported in January that there were five possible mass graves on the outskirts of Bujumbura, citing satellite images, video footage and witness accounts after killings in December that were allegedly carried out by Burundian security forces. Andre Ndimurukundo has been searching for his brother Pascal after he was picked up in Bujumbura by a known intelligence agent last December on charges he had participated in street protests against Nkurunziza. \"We have been visiting all police cells since (Pascal's) arrest but without luck and we don't know whether he is still alive,\" said Ndimurukundo, who fled into exile. \"But a month after his arrest, we received several strange calls from people who said our brother could be released if we paid some money, but we knew even if we paid money his captors would not release him.\" The missing man, who was married with four children, is now thought to be dead. Lambert Nigarura, a prominent lawyer and activist in Burundi, said a group of local lawyers has been trying to gather evidence from families whose relatives disappeared in hopes of taking some Burundian government officials to the International Criminal Court. \"The biggest challenge we face is that these families are threatened not to speak out by the government,\" Nigarura said. \"The world has let the people of Burundi down.

Brigadier General Athanase Kararuza and his wife and daughter were killed in the country's capital Bujumbura, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement. Kararuza was a military adviser in the office of Burundi's vice president. Dujarric said Kararuza's death followed several instances of politically motivated assassination attempts in Burundi in recent weeks, including an attack on Sunday on Martin Nivyabandi, Minister of Human Rights, Social Affairs and Gender and attacks on prominent members of the security forces. \"All such acts of violence serve no purpose other than to worsen the already volatile situation in Burundi. The Secretary-General urges that a rigorous and prompt investigation of these events is undertaken,\" Dujarric said. \"(Ban) calls on all political leaders, including those in exile, to firmly renounce the use of violence in pursuit of political agendas and commit to an inclusive and genuine dialogue,\" he said. Tit-for-tat attacks between President Pierre Nkurunziza's security forces and his opponents have escalated since April 2015 when he announced a disputed bid for a third term as president and won re-election in July.

Rwanda and Burundi have a similar ethnic makeup. The U.N. Security Council is considering options for deploying between 20 and 3,000 police to Burundi to help quell simmering political violence, though the government has signaled it would only accept 20 unarmed experts.

United Nations investigators had documented at least 345 cases of torture and ill treatment since the start of the year and met detainees with fresh wounds, including some who had been beaten or burned so severely they could not walk unaided, Zeid Ra\u2019ad al-Hussein, the agency\u2019s high commissioner for human rights, said in a statement. \u201cThese shocking figures are a clear indicator of the widespread and growing use of torture and ill treatment by government security forces,\u201d Mr. al-Hussein said. He added that he was also deeply concerned over reports emerging of the existence of secret detention facilities across the country. His statement follows mounting international pressure on President Pierre Nkurunziza to defuse a political crisis characterized by escalating violence since he decided in April last year to run for a third term. The United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, and a number of African leaders, among them South Africa\u2019s president, Jacob Zuma, have visited Burundi in recent weeks to try to persuade Mr. Nkurunziza to negotiate with political opponents and avert a civil war that could ignite wider regional violence. Their efforts have had little visible result so far. The United Nations has documented the deaths of about 500 people in the past year, but human rights groups believe many more have died at the hands of the president\u2019s security services and Imbonerakure, a militia of the ruling party\u2019s youth wing. Thousands have also been detained and more than a quarter of a million Burundians have fled to neighboring countries to escape the violence, the United Nations has reported. Overt violence had shown signs of subsiding but covert violence was rising, Christof Heyns, the United Nations expert monitoring the crisis, told the Human Rights Council in Geneva last month. He cited a growing number of disappearances and underscored the fear that the political crisis could \u201copen up old wounds\u201d between Burundi\u2019s ethnic Hutu and Tutsi communities. More than 300,000 people are estimated to have died in a 12-year civil war that ended in 2005. Mr. al-Hussein on Monday drew attention to reports that some government security agencies were involved in arrests, killings and disappearances of members of the army and the police. These abductions appear to have singled out mostly Tutsi members of a group known as Ex-Fab, made up of veterans who served in the armed forces before the end of the civil war."], [19170, "2016-04-20T04:58:14Z", [0.7], ""], [691, "2016-04-19T23:09:23Z", [0.58], ""], [368, "2016-04-19T20:16:02Z", [0.55], ""], [16451, "2016-04-19T19:35:19Z", [0.75], "Comment deleted on Apr 21, 2016 05:41PM UTC"], [14815, "2016-04-19T13:08:24Z", [0.75], ""], [484, "2016-04-19T06:19:24Z", [0.75], "Back up 5% @Flyn1200"], [14208, "2016-04-19T03:17:59Z", [1.0], "I will hold 100% for now.

Abdallah Hassan, Governor of Ruyigi Province, located next to the Tanzanian border, said that the attackers entered the market in Munyinya on Monday evening and opened fire. The governor said that the attackers were believed to include Burundian refugees who had come in from a camp in Tanzania, and that five suspects had been arrested.

The inquiry, led by Burundi authorities, into allegations of extra-judicial executions by members of the security forces on 11 December 2015, in the capital Bujumbura, focused on the most deadly operation by government security forces since the African nation's political crisis began in April last year. n the main inquiry conclusions, Prosecutor General Valentin Bagorikunda, who set up the probe, did not mention killings or abuses of residents in the capital by the security forces, instead alleging that victims killed on 11 December were armed \"combatants\" wearing police or military uniforms. 'Burundi ignored widespread abuses by security forces' Human Rights Watch (HRW) Africa director, Daniel Bekele, described the probe as \"one of several official inquiries that have failed to properly investigate security force abuses or hold those responsible to account\", highlighting how the findings were \"misleading and biased\". (Read: Comparing Human Rights Watch and President Nkurunziza's rights abuses inquiries). Contrary to official conclusions, HRW investigators found that police and military officials shot dead a large number of people in opposition strongholds \u2013 including Nyakabiga and Musaga \u2013 apparently in retaliation for opposition attacks on four military installations, and for heavy shooting at security forces by gunmen in these neighbourhoods. \"HRW found no indications that the victims had participated in the attacks on the military installations. Some victims were found lying side by side, face down, and appeared to have been shot in the back or the head. Others survived with serious injuries. The security forces also carried out large-scale arbitrary arrests in both neighbourhoods,\" the organisation said in a statement on 13 April. \"These inquiries have covered up state abuses and have not led to justice,\" Bekele said. HRW highlighted the need for an independent, international commission of inquiry into the abuses \"given the Burundian justice system's inability or unwillingness to conduct credible and thorough investigations\". Inquiry to help work of UN and AU rapporteurs Bekele explained an independent international commission of inquiry would also help support the efforts of special rapporteurs from the UN Human Rights Council and the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights. The little team presented its interim report to the Human Rights Council on 22 March, with Christof Heyns, the UN special rapporteur on extra-judicial, summary or arbitrary executions, saying that while previous overt violence seemed to have subsided, \"covert violence, for example, in the form of disappearances, seems to have increased\". \"There are some in (the Burundi) government who seem to be open to change. Others, however, are in denial anything is wrong,\" Heyns said. The two UN and one AU rapporteurs are expected to return to Bujumbura in June, while a small team of human rights monitors will be based in the country. Last week, the UK government called on the Burundian government to protect human rights and stop abuses, after raising concerns about the treatment of prisoners in the African nation. The bloody crisis that has seen up to 900 people killed, pits supporters of President Pierre Nkurunziza against those who say that his re-election in July 2015 for a third term violated the nation's constitution. After a failed coup, the government intensified its crackdown and most of those arrested or disappeared today are young men and women accused of participating in or supporting opposition groups, including armed groups whose attacks have also left dozens dead."], [783, "2016-04-15T00:40:31Z", [0.8], "Burundi government party official killed in tit-for-tat violence\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/us-burundi-politics-idUSKCN0XB140 A official from Burundi's ruling party was shot dead, a local administrator said on Thursday, in what appeared the latest in a spate of tit-for-tat killings that U.N. officials fear is driving the nation back into conflict. Phocas Bakaza, a member of the CNDD-FDD party in Mutimbuza area near the capital Bujumbura, was killed late on Wednesday. Two people have been arrested in connection with the attack, district administrator Damien Barindambi said. More than 400 people have been killed in politically motivated violence, U.N officials and rights groups estimate, since President Pierre Nkurunziza's announced his bid for a third term in April 2015. Opponents said his move violated the constitution and a peace deal that ended the country's 1993-2005 civil war. The government cited a subsequent court ruling that said he could run again, and he went on to win a disputed vote in July. U.N. officials have said the crisis risks pushing Burundi back to the kind of ethnically charged conflict that characterized the war, in which 300,000 people died. Some 250,000 people have fled the country since violence erupted, most to border camps in neighboring Tanzania. Officials said armed men from among those refugees may have been responsible for a separate attack on Monday near the border in Burundi's Ruyigi district, in which five people died and seven were wounded. \"Based on what the population is saying, one can conclude that the attackers are Burundian refugees from Tanzania,\" another regional administrator, Gisuru Aloys Ngenzirabona, told Reuters. Tanzanian officials could not be reached for comment. A Burundi soldier was also killed on Thursday when an armed group attacked a military camp northwest of Bujumbura, an army officer told Reuters. There was no immediate official comment. Three groups, including one led by officers behind a failed May coup, have launched armed rebellions against the government, officials say. None have claimed responsibility for the latest attacks. Such incidents are likely to feed into concerns that the violence could spill over in the volatile Great Lakes region, which is still haunted by Rwanda's 1994 genocide.

Francophonie suspends cooperation with Burundi, reinstates CAR\nhttp://www.africanews.com/2016/04/08/francophonie-suspends-cooperation-with-burundi-reinstates-car/ The International Organisation of La Francophonie (OIF) decided to partially suspend its multilateral cooperation with Burundi due to \u201clack of progress\u201d of political dialogue in the country ravaged by crisis for nearly a year. In a statement released on Friday, the Permanent Council of the organization chaired by Canadian Michaelle Jean, in a Council session on Thursday in Paris, announced the reinstatement of the Central African Republic (CAR) in its body, saluting \u201cthe responsibility showed in its government transition process.\u201d CAR organized successful elections in the past few weeks after three years of sectarian violence that ravaged the country. But for Burundi, members of the Permanent Council \u201cdeplored the deterioration of the security situation and absence of progress in the establishment of a truly inclusive political dialogue despite significant continued efforts by the international community,\u201d said the statement. \u201cThey therefore decided to suspend multilateral Francophonie cooperation deployed in Burundi, with the exception of programmes directly benefiting the civilian population and those which may contribute to the restoration of democracy.\u201d Burundi has not officially reacted to the announcement, but the head of presidential communication, Willy Nyamitwe, posted a tweet denouncing a \u201ccomedy\u201d of \u201cbad taste\u201d. \u201cAs if #Francophonie was a god and that #Burundi should bow down to this denial of its sovereignty,\u201d he added in a second tweet.

Many of these forces are abroad participating in UN peacekeeping missions throughout Africa.  These UN positions are highly sought after because they pay exponentially (10x) more than any job in Burundi.  NPR reported how a Burundi soldier at home can get a UN posting saying,  \"to win these posts, a soldier has to pledge loyalty to Burundi's government...there have been some in the military who believe that if they engage in violence \u2014 violently suppress opposition or the rebellion \u2014 they will be able to reap the reward of their allegiance by being sent abroad\" (2).  Last week the EU reported cutting Burundis funding for peacekeepers.  I wanted to know the details of this story.  It seems the EU/UN pays one thousand dollars per month to Burundi per soldier sent abroad.  The state of Burundi keeps two hundred dollars of that and eight hundred goes to the soldiers.  What was cut was the two hundred dollars to the State of Burundi (3).  Two days ago the UN Security Council approved a Police force to mitigate violence in Burundi, the UN placed a timeline of fifteen days for various courses of action (4).  Unfortunately, UN Peacekeepers are in the news the past week for sexual assaults and rape (5,6).   The UN has problems internally and externally with peacekeepers.  Maybe that\u2019s why the UN Security Council is calling for \u201cPolice\u201d instead of peacekeepers (same people different name?).  I suspect Burundi soldiers abroad will be asked to re-negotiate their pay structures soon taking less money for coveted security jobs.  I also suspect the Burundi version for the pay cut will be b/c of rebels and Rwanda troublemakers.  If the UN sends Police that means more people with guns will be in Burundi.  If these \u201cPolice\u201d are really just Peacekeepers with a new name expect more of the same.  This GJ question says the thousand deaths include \u201cstate security forces, rebel armies, and other militias\u201d That means UN \u201cPolice\u201d count.  I thought that perhaps if the UN went to Burundi and offered cash for guns then there could be less violence but it seems this has already been done in 2013 (7).  Now you have an unarmed population defending themselves with sticks against the Burundi military.  The only thing that will stop the mass murders/killing in Burundi is Ebola.

The UN is sending a token police force, they say. Or maybe not, as the resolution has no direction, and the Burundi government approved of the resolution with some demands that the UN may not accept.  As stated in an earlier rationale, the president of Burundi views another outside military force as an invasion. With any 'invasion' he will blame 'enemies of the state' who support them and will employ that excuse to persecute them. He will gather his supporters who have an interest in keeping him in office to protest and take action and they, in turn, will have their street supporters do whatever is necessary to protect the president. If he is involuntarily removed, it becomes an existential moment for his supporters.

This would be specific enough, so there is no need for ethnic violence to occur for a resolution in my view. The deaths would have to be attributable to either the gov. or the opposition though, so if only the combined number of deaths surpasses 1.000, this still won't resolve this question. In light of the past atrocities in Burundi (and Rwanda) between Tutsi and Hutu, the ethnic tensions get picked up in almost every article. While I also think that there is some risk, so far neither the opposition nor the government seem to dissolve into specific ethnic groups. The Hutu dominate the gov., but there are still a lot of influent Tutsi involved and the Tutsi are also represented in the security forces. But then again: The same has been written about the rather comprehensive character of Assads military at the beginning of the Arab Spring in Syria. Without a civil war however, I doubt that the conflict between the gov. and the opposition will escalate above the treshold. It's far from impossible: Taking the number of targeted killings and the recently discovered mass graves into consideration, this could happen. But it is def. not a forgone conclusion in my view and my forecast is even lower than HW15s. I am thinking about raising it a bit, because there are so many factors in play that are hard to predict, but in general I expect that the international attention will pressure the Gov. to show at least some restraint (while I nevertheless also expect that the targeted killings and abductions will sadly continue or increase). For a mass killing episode to occur, the conflict - in my view - would have to escalate into a civil war though. I am not sure how likely this is at this point. Rebel activities are increasing since they began attacking military bases on december 11th, but it's hard to tell how much support they got or may get. I got no compelling argument or analysis for this probability and am waiting for further developments / articles. That's just my two cents worth on this. I may change my view and I am taking no responsibility. ;-) It's tough to tell, so I am refering back to data: If you look at the ACLED Realtime 2016 Data (updated 26th March 2016) for Burundi, 161 civilians have been killed in \"violence agaignst civilians\"-events so far (91 of them have been backdated to december 2015, but could still count). While most perpetrators could not be identified, the Government, consisting of: - CNDD-FDD-Imbonerakure: National Council for the Defence of Democracy (Imbonerakure Faction)\n- Police Forces of Burundi (2005-)\n- Military Forces of Burundi (2005-) \n- Military Forces of Burundi (2005-) National Intelligence Agency, is responsible for 88 of these 161 civilian deaths so far.  Mass killings do not develop linear and the fact that high-profile people are getting assasinated on an almost daily basis is deeply worrying. While there is talk about peace talks, the president kind of resembles Assad right now by stating that he is open for any talks at any time, but of course not with terrorists (e.g. the armed opposition). There may be further mass graves that may get backdated or additional data and reports publicated by human rights groups, concerning the fate of abducted persons, the identitiy of so far unkown perpetrators and so on.. so the death toll may rise. But it's still relatively low. Again, sadly: There is a fair chance that the conflict may escalate quickly and that this question may resolve positive. Furthermore, ACLED changed its Burundi source for data collection, is still backdating events and seems to arrive at higher numbers.

BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) \u2014 Burundi's attorney general has acknowledged that the government buried dozens of suspected rebels who died in December attacks on three military bases without notifying their families, but fell short of admitting the existence of mass graves. Human Rights groups accused the Burundi government of trying hide the extent of the killings during December 11 attacks by suspect rebels by burying bodies in mass graves. Valentin Bagorikunda said Thursday that out of 87 people who died, the government buried 58 bodies of suspected rebels. Eight of those killed in the December 11 attacks were security officials, he says. At least 400 people have died in Burundi since April when President Pierre Nkurunziza launched his campaign for a third term in office which many oppose. Nkurunziza was re-elected in July.

I am reading Tetlock's Superforecasting and learning about the inside and outside views.  I have been starting from an inside view, which has some problems.  So I looked at this again from an outside view. Since Burundian independence in 1962, we have had 54 years.  I think independence in Africa marks a very important change in the situation, so it is a useful cut off.  Of those 54 years, there was serious violence on a large scale in 21 years.  This is from a quick reading over breakfast of Wikipedia, with my daughter talking about school on the side, so if anyone wants to revise that, I will not contest it!  I make that a 38% base chance of serious violence in any given year in Burundi. I didn't see any other clear starting dates to use.  I did see clearly that the previous conflicts did have a heavy ethnic component, but I still put a lot of value in the first hand accounts of Burundians stating that this is not ethnically driven, at this time.  However, I do see that appeals to ethnic arguments could have fertile ground. I also drew from this that Burundi is usually pretty unstable, which gave me a different view of the current situation.  The current crisis is a bit more situation normal than it might be in a Kenya or a Tanzania.  Serious, but I was perhaps over valuing it. I do still think this is more likely than not to flare up badly and that 1,000 deaths is a pretty low bar, but now think my initial forecast was too high.

Some forecasters decreased their probability based on the clarification while others increased because of it...just an observation. If/when the explosions as we're hearing about today continue, and as we get closer to the first 12 months elapsing, I'll start to make bigger increases. Right now we have 400 deaths in ten months (widely accepted media death toll & timeline, even though I think this is inclusive of deaths that don't meet EWP criteria; but its conservative and probably prudent to use it.) I think its unlikely that we'll witness 600 more by the end of April (12mo). However, it is certainly possible if escalation continues to see enough deaths to meet the 1000+ threshold by the time this question closes, even against the very specific and restrictive criteria. Media has a propensity to underplay good news and overplay bad news and the AU & UN have significant strides to make in prevention and negotiation in the coming weeks.

There is a lot of debate about whether this conflict will take on ethnic dimensions or not, with the logic that political violence will not lead to a mass killing(s). From @clinton 's post, I would agree with the CFR's analysis that while ethnic tensions \"may be less salient...political divisions have become explosive.\" I think too many of us are focusing on a Rwanda-type situation involving genocide, and seeing a low likelihood of mass killings as a result. However, I see less of a Rwanda-esque scenario and instead draw parallels to the Ivorian crisis of 2010-2011. What we have is a despotic President (Gbagbo and Nkurunziza) attempting to hold onto power through dubious means. Street protests and violent opposition have already manifested, but not on a large enough scale to meet the EWP conditions. However, hateful rhetoric and low-level violence continue. It is thus not a stretch to predict an escalation sometime in the near future.  Nkurunziza's refusal to entertain AU and UN peacekeeping efforts mean that successful preemptive diplomatic intervention will be difficult to pull off. In the event of intense violence, I doubt the AU (and especially not the UN) will able to take action in a timely enough fashion to prevent a mass killing of over 1,000. http://www.africanews.com/2016/02/04/belgium-ready-to-join-efforts-in-burundi-s-peacekeeping-mission/"], [3363, "2016-02-10T15:29:04Z", [0.32], ""], [73, "2016-02-10T14:23:25Z", [0.67], "+ 2 http://ewn.co.za/2016/02/10/Burundi-is-on-the-brink-a-crisis-explained.

The only stories coming out of the country are from state-owned media or those brave enough to share updates on Twitter or blogs,\u201d points out Huguette Umutoni, a specialist in the World Economic Forum\u2019s Africa team.

There's a chance rebels could recruit unwilling \"combatants\" who would then be easy prey, but I doubt that would count for the purposes of this question.  The December massacre would have to repeat itself every month to reach 1000 killings, which seems very unlikely given the alarm provoked by the initial incident. It's also possible that 1000+ people could die in a single terrible event, but that would be a massive increase in scale over what's happened so far. It would likely be an entire town or neighborhood accused of rebel sympathies -- but are the rebels going to hide in a populous area? Are they powerful enough to force communities to support them? So far, that doesn't seem to be the case -- we've seen only targeted attacks by small groups of gunmen, plus that one December battle.

These questions can be fairly fuzzy and ultimately, we're trying to help policymakers and NGOs and people at risk so your participation and patience with the clarifications is very much appreciated. For our coding purposes, we track these episodes on a continuous basis. So in the case of Burundi, we're including all deaths (that fit our definition, i.e. non-combatant civilians targeted as part of a discrete group) since violence began in the spring of 2015. To this end, HW15 is mostly correct; the violence is known to us and could be coded as a mass killing episode if and when it crosses the 1000 threshold. The question would then be resolved in the affirmative. In terms of targeted groups, keep in mind that so far in fatality counts only some have been noncombatant civilians, and only some of those appear to have been killed intentionally (as part of a group that would be defined as \"political opposition\" for example). And on this I would again refer you to our blog posts where we've made these determinations, often based on specific reports from groups like Amnesty or Human Rights Watch or based on news reports. We'll continue to keep a close eye on all news from Burundi (and tweet as much of it as possible from our account @earlywarnproj) and on comments. ~~~ Then, a follow from @GJDrew: So as I understand it, past casualties count, but only if they fit the criteria. The casualties you read in the press may not all fit. 2 criteria to watch are: 1. \"deliberate actions\" and 2. \"non-combatants\". But they help set the range of possible - so take it into account. Some things have already been happening in Burundi; it's not a clean slate. ~~~ And Early Warning Project once more: Yes (technically all casualties have to fit that criteria but I was clarifying the question referring to the status quo which in the case of Burundi is an uptick in violence since Spring 2015). ~~~~~ COMMENT: Alright. So, as @GJDrew so eloquently stated, for this IFP, we should be focusing on \"deliberate actions\" and \"non-combatants\" when reading press clippings from these countries.

The AU could not agree on sending troops to Burundi, with some of the more influential countries such as ZA determining it was not prudent to send in troops as they are currently wrestling with the idea as to whether or not stay in the ICC due to SA's perceived idea that the ICC  is committing a 'witch hunt' against some  African leaders.  Other nations did not support the idea of sending in troops due to an alleged belief these troops may topple their leadership in the future.  A stumbling block for them is President Pierre Nkurunziza, a member of the AU,  advising the AU not to send in troops as he would denounce the intervention as an \"invasion\".  The AU intends to send a delegation to Burundi to have a dialog with the president on topics which may include sending a peacekeeping force or sanctions to persuade him to open his nation to peacekeeping troops, or police, or human rights monitors. The goal is to send 5,000 peacekeeping troops, a number inadequate to keep the peace in an area hostile to, and suspicious of,  them by the government.  References African Union. (2001).

OCHA reports give an average of 68 deaths per month over the last three months of 2015 and continued deaths in January.  Assuming no change, we would expect 800 deaths in 2016.  That is most of the way to 1,000 within a year.  A relatively small spate of intense violence would push the total above 1,000. Refugee outflows have continued in January, though perhaps motivated by flooding.  This suggests Burundians are expecting more violence.  There is an active opposition in the country and probably armed opposition groups in Congo.  Thus the crisis is likely to continue for some time.  The EU has cut the pay support to the Burundian troops in Somalia, which could lead to morale issues.  I assume that the troops kept in Burundi are seen to be more loyal than those placed several countries away, where they can not easily be involved in internal politics.  But with recent AL Shabaab success and possible pay problems, they may be even less predictable.  The government will be even more nervous about their troop loyalty than before.  The economy is weak and the political leadership is isolated. The government policy of use of violence and avoiding discussions has, so far, kept them in power despite the problems.  My guess is that it is seen as a winning plan.  The continued antagonism towards the AU and UN, including arrests of UN staff, in recent days suggests a continued \"large and in charge\" strategy.  This would see continued low level killings.  Any serious opposition will be thus met with force and more deaths, as would a serious coup attempt.  Even if successful, the coup attempt would likely push the total above 1000. Why not a higher %?

(For a more \ndetailed analysis, see http://www.earlywarningproject.com/definitions). This is a difficult question of forecast vs. event when defining 'success' of \nprobabilty within this framework.  1. There are massacres which are orchestrated by terrorist groups that, using terror as theater, will take responsibility for the event.\n2. There are government groups that will not announce their massacre as it will reflect poorly on their administration.\n3. There are killings in villages, small in number, as a matter of ideology (property, religious, ethnic) where the assailants are not known as militants or government supporters but perhaps are so.  In other words, there are killings that add up to massacres over a time frame, but they may or may not have been reported or the cause is unknown. But, for all intent and purpose, were ordered and discharged.  Also, unless one is a geologist or expert forensic investigator and so forth, the stones do not speak of mass killings. Recently, a mass grave was discovered from WW II in Slovenia, there were also mass graves discovered after conflicts in the Balkan areas such as Glodjane and Srebrenica, or further back in Honduras during Iran-Contra.  These disclosures, based on physical evidence, were well after the massacres.   That is, there is a difference between act and discovery, sometimes months or years. They took place during XXXX, but were not verified until XXWY.  Some other challenges are noted. If they took place during 2016 and witnesses say the bodies were transported to the mountain or a large bog, the claims may not become verified until after 2016 due to the month of the massacre, the intra and inter government and NGO willingness to investigate the charge, (if it was ordered by a government, there are delays), and the funding and resources necessary to validate or nullify the allegations of the event. Based on these limitations, it is possible that the forecast is correct but well after the forecast time frame is closed.  The Early Warning Project states that it produces risk assessments of the potential for mass atrocities around the world by combining state-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative analysis. The project aims to give governments, advocacy groups, and at-risk societies earlier and more reliable warning, and thus more opportunity to take action, before such killings occur. https://www.gjopen.com/challenges/7-early-warning-project-2016 Therefore, one could forecast a massacre in country X if the numbers exceed 1,000, but one might take into consideration some of the limitations and attributes noted in this discussion. One could say, yes, based on the information available, a massacre is likely and if there are mass killings over this time frame, it is necessary that they are overt or quickly located for the forecaster to gain in his or her accuracy score.  1. Can the forecaster produce a quantifiable or qualitative earlier and more reliable warning assessment in the time frame  to prove or to have proven a risk of massacre in country X, or\n2. Is it a question as to whether there is enough compliance and physical evidence based on resources and funding by various interest groups to prove or disprove a massacre was based in country X within that same time frame of the forecast?  One is based on the immediate event, the other on the longer investigation of an alleged event. In this subtext, there are two separately framed questions that have two separately framed answers in the forecast model. That said, I will move forward with the goal of trying to satisfy both questions in my forecast in a \u2018leap of faith\u2019 without seeming like the fool as illustrated in the Rider-Waite Tarot card. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fool_(Tarot_card)#/media/File:RWS_Tarot_00_Fool.jpg My rationale to follow."], [11788, "2016-02-03T20:29:34Z", [0.5], ""], [10039, "2016-02-03T18:50:54Z", [0.3], ""], [10039, "2016-02-03T18:50:14Z", [0.3], ""], [2, "2016-02-03T18:40:17Z", [0.39], "Moving up to 39% because I didn't take into account:  our definition of killing includes non-state actors, while the expert pool doesn't, so our adjusted expert pool answer is probably somewhere in the 40-ish to 50% range.
