While the unique art style and message of KUBO is enough to deserve a nomination, it only made around $75 million worldwide. It was rated 8.4/10 on RottenTomatoes. While MOANA, created by the animation powerhouse Disney, grossed 553.3 million, the tried-and-true Disney formula. of a young woman coming of age amidst supernatural events has become trite. Audiences recognize this, as the film got 7.9/10 average score on RT. Overall, Zootopia outshone all of these. Bringing crisp animation, a fresh storyline, and writing that can be enjoyed by all ages, the anthropomorphic, thinly veiled metaphor for racism is exactly what America needs to be awarded, especially in this political climate. Grossing over $1 Billion USD at the box office, it also was raved critically, giving an 8.1 weighted average score on RottenTomatoes.

While money has little bearing on how Oscars are selected, the strongest correlation in that field is seen in animated films (the past three winners of this award being in the top 21 highest grossing animated films of all time).
