A passage in June would be exceptionally quick given that the Commission's proposal came out as recently as March 21.  The unanimity requirement on fiscal matters (which includes the UK's vote) is a major hurdle. Ireland, Luxembourg, and Malta are likely to object. And the list of dissenters could be bigger. Scandinavian countries have voiced concerns as well [2]. Some countries will be worried about aggravating trade relations with the U.S. It is no coincidence that the proposal is informally referred to as the GAFA tax. On top of it all the EC's proposal is not the solution most countries are looking for but presented by the EC as a temporary fix in the interim. The EC wants urgent action but that is not necessarily the case with member states.
