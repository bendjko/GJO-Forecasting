But as they gathered Friday, the bloc\u2019s leaders seemed to have found common ground in growing concerns over President Trump\u2019s unexpected new policies and unconventional mode of governance.\nMainstream European political figures \u2014 already worried about populist challenges and the specter of Russian interference in their own upcoming elections \u2014 have been rattled by a rapid-fire series of controversial presidential directives and combative behavior, including a getting-to-know-you call with Australia\u2019s prime minister that reportedly ended abruptly when Trump became irritated over a refugee agreement.\nIn Valletta, the ancient fortress-capital of the Mediterranean island nation of Malta, leaders arriving for the EU\u2019s first gathering since Trump\u2019s inauguration had some sharp words for the 2-week-old U.S. administration \u2014 some centering on policy disagreements, and some on the president\u2019s unorthodox style.\nBoth before and after he took office, Trump has been vocal in his support of Britain\u2019s vote last June to exit the European Union, and has made repeated and almost offhand references to the likelihood of the bloc breaking up. He has also called NATO \u201cobsolete,\u201d but in recent days has signaled at least a degree of support for the transatlantic alliance that most European nations regard as vital to their security.\nTrump\u2019s remarks have been read by many in Europe as a sign that the new U.S. president has little regard for international institutions widely credited with underpinning decades of peace and economic progress. French President Francois Hollande, who spoke with Trump last weekend, was perhaps the most openly combative in his view of the U.S. leader (para. 1-5). King, L. (2017).

One of the most frequently cited reasons for exiting the EU is lack of control of its borders.  This will undoubtedly be a hot issue if the UK decides to pack up go home.

(1) EU law makes withdrawal very difficult - the UK and Ireland, uniquely among EU member states have opt-outs; while the newest EU member states - Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia (also I think Cyprus) - while not yet in Schengen are, under the terms of their admission to the EU, obligated to join it as soon as technically feasible.\nAs such, the Schengen agreement is part of the acquis communitaire , so will also be binding on any future new EU member states. (2) Non-EU states included in Schengen could withdraw a little more easily. These are Iceland, Norway and Switzerland. These states are really not those under most pressure as a result of the migration crisis. (3) It is conceivable that a nationalist government could come to power, by the usual course of elections, in several EU-Schengen states, which might wish to withdraw from Schengen. (Austria - with a potentially FPOe-led government -  may be a prime contender for this - but the date of the next general election is uncertain, and need not be before late 2018, so beyond the period under survey. A nationalist surge may be possible in elections in France in 2017, but the electoral system serves to discriminate harshly against the FN, which is the principal party that might promote withdrawal from Schengen). But even were such a state of affaris to come into effect, there is no existing accepted procedure for withdrawal to occur - unless implemented as a fait accompli (quite unprecedented, and likely to have serious consequences for that country in terms of its other relations with the Union) - it seems almost impossible that a way of negotiating this could take place during the 18 month period under consideration. (4) If the UK votes to leave the EU (which still seems improbable - and which itself would be expected to take at least two years to be effected), it is possible that an anti-EU (and anti-Schengen) surge might occur in response in other countries. But again, the lack of established procedures for withdrawal from Schengen - and the lack of sense even that any such decision might even be legitimate and tolerable to the EU hierarchy) - means that, unless a fait accompli is made, means that the timespan under survey still seems too short. (5) The recent precedents of crisis management in the EU, with regard to its other major transnational project - the Euro - where any potential exit has been firmly excluded, even by successively incoherent and contradictory policies - shows the centralising mood of the EU establishment, and the lack of willingness to tolerate national deviance from the centrally applied norm."], [38, "2016-05-03T20:27:25Z", [0.96], "Hungary will hold a referendum in September or October of this year regarding future EU quotas for resettling refugees.

Another major migrant crisis, more movement behind right-wing and nationalist groups throughout Europe, and subsequent terror attacks by foreign nationals would all be likely to trigger a withdrawal. I don't have a good quantitative way to combine this info, but perhaps finding probabilities of each potential trigger (politician bringing up the issue, passage through government, supporting events) would be some areas for groundwork.
