Results / calculations follow. Summary of my approach: \n1) I pulled down the viewership information from the past 2 seasons here: \nhttp://www.sportsmediawatch.com/nfl-tv-ratings-viewership-nbc-cbs-fox-espn-nfln-regular-season-playoffs/ 2) Straight Averaging SNF gives you a result of: 16.5M 3) However, this ignores the teams that played, as such I conducted a team-by-team assessment of viewership. DAL / PIT / GB had the most consistent high-viewership (22.0M / 20.6M / 20.2M, respectively) A number of teams had really low viewership and few data-points (LA, CLE, TEN) all with less than 7 Million. So what about the two playing Sunday? \nDAL: 22.0M (Highest) \nPHI: 14.6M (Average)   This puts my Base guess of viewership as: 16.4 = [Avg (14.6, 22.0) + SNF Premium (1.8) + Annual Adjust (-1.6)] * Futon to SMW Ratio (.89%) Words of caution: \n1) Standard Deviation of the errors recently is about 7.5% of the estimate (1.4M in this case). \n2) DAL has among the highest viewership, and I'm not really sure why the model is spitting out something so low. \n3) PHI Is currently 8-1, which should boost viewership. \n4) DAL / PHI played last year on SNF with viewership of 18 Million according to SMW (16.0M Equivalent).  \n5) Only DAL vs. SF on 10/22 would not have kept viewership in the top bucket this year.  (DAL vs. AZ also, but excluded since MNF always posting terrible viewership)\n6) Downward Trend:  Obviously there is a significant downward trend in viewership.  I've started to account for this in my annual adjustment (now up to a 1.6 reduction for 2017).  However, this has been growing rather than shrinking.  Trend lining the miss would suggest a reduction of 1.8 is necessary for this week.  I hope this helps.\nNote:  I have been really tempted to over-ride my model this week with a 100% chance to be 16+"], [41009, "2017-11-17T21:27:00Z", [0.04, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.87], "Well, I'm pretty sure my prior model is overshooting now, but here it goes."], [12879, "2017-11-17T19:03:06Z", [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.25, 0.0], "WAG.....WILL the NFL BOYCOTT still continue???"], [34353, "2017-11-17T18:14:17Z", [0.01, 0.01, 0.25, 0.42, 0.31], "Last week was lower viewership than I thought, but higher that the community's consensus. This week's SNF game is a NFC East rivalry match-up between the first place Eagles and the second place Cowboys. As it stands, the Eagles are likely to secure a playoff spot. Dallas, however, needs to win this game and several more to stay in contention for a wild card spot.  The game should be interesting, given Zeke Elliott's suspension, Dallas' seeming implosion last week, Philly's on fire offense, and the fact that divisional rivalries are usually more competitive games since the teams play each other at least twice every season, which provides plenty of film for review and planning. Dallas has a large fan base, and Philly's fans are particularly engaged this season given how well the team has been doing. Conversely, SNF viewership has been steadily declining with notable exceptions, so that may affect overall viewership. But I'm going to forecast on the higher end given the match-up."]]}
