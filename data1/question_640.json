Might this spark protests, riots in the next two weeks? Base rate, from the ACLED database for 2017: Jan 1; Feb 4; Mar 7; April 1; May 1; June 0; July 0; Aug 1. Things have been quiet lately, but we see some volatility in the data.  Average per month 1.875, high of 7, low of zero. Divide by two to get ~ per two week base rate, gives 0.9375. Add in the ongoing conventions of the two parties, it seems highly likely to get at least one protest or riot. On the other hand, since April, between one or zero events per month. Compromising between earlier and more recent base rates -- which might be overfitting!  I come up with 45%.\n"], [40365, "2017-10-15T17:34:44Z", [0.01], ""], [3316, "2017-10-15T16:45:07Z", [0.0], ""], [35, "2017-10-15T13:09:12Z", [0.03], ""], [691, "2017-10-15T12:22:16Z", [0.01], ""], [83, "2017-10-14T22:07:24Z", [0.4], "Student/Faculty protests in October of 2016 and 2017."], [12302, "2017-10-14T18:44:58Z", [0.05], ""], [12302, "2017-10-14T18:40:19Z", [0.1], ""], [12302, "2017-10-14T18:39:58Z", [1.0], ""], [691, "2017-10-14T12:54:16Z", [0.01], ""], [27316, "2017-10-14T11:33:27Z", [0.01], ""], [37379, "2017-10-14T02:15:04Z", [0.25], ""], [37474, "2017-10-13T23:50:52Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-10-13T17:23:25Z", [0.01], ""], [13959, "2017-10-13T16:33:07Z", [0.03], ""], [22264, "2017-10-13T13:24:45Z", [0.0], ""], [1333, "2017-10-12T19:36:55Z", [0.35], ""], [298, "2017-10-12T19:23:47Z", [0.07], ""], [31450, "2017-10-12T17:11:21Z", [0.03], "There have been 15 riots/protests this year but the vast majority were about the situation in Njala University which seems to have been resolved.
