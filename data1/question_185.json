One is to include the old data from 2007-14 while doing the analysis, and the other way is to base it only on the data sourced from 2014-16 period.  If it is the latter approach, probability is very high that industry-wide average cost in 2016 will be below $300. I would put it at >85%. Why? Because the starting point for the projection (i.e., average cost in 2014 done on a fresh slate) is likely to be about $50 below the $410 level given by the old study. This is of course assuming that the new data from 2014 takes the same shape as the old data on 2014. If they decided to carry over the old data on 2014 into the new study as well, the $50 drop becomes a near certainty. If we apply a very conservative 10% decline (as opposed to the empirically observed 14%) on that lower starting base in 2014, the cost drops below $300.  However, if it is the former approach, estimating the probability is much harder. Extrapolating 14% decline on $410 takes us down to about $300, but not below it.   We would have to resort to a guess that since market leaders like Tesla and Nissan are more in the news these later years, their cost base will have more of a say in the data collected, and because of that the average cost is more likely to end up below $300. Because of the uncertainties involved, I would be uncomfortable giving more than about 70%-75% probability, in this resolution approach. I have written to GJO for clarity on which resolution is going to be used. Till I have that clarity, I am taking the mid-point of the probabilities suggested by the two approaches (72.5% & 90%), and giving a probability of 80%.\n-----------------------------------\nAs an aside, the advantage of using a multiple year cost curve for resolving this question is that there is less uncertainty in the forecasting. A single year average can be thrown off by one or two outlier data points (what I was afraid of in my first post on this question - https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/252972), but when we project from multiple years data, the calculation is likely to be more reliable and on expected lines.\n-----------------------------------\nUpdate: Please check out discussion on the methodology triggered by @dowser post for the background on this post.\nhttps://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/258503"], [691, "2016-06-14T11:53:29Z", [0.68], ""], [24754, "2016-06-14T03:36:43Z", [0.79], "Another battery plant has been scheduled to open - which suggests costs have been coming down."], [484, "2016-06-14T02:29:52Z", [0.7], "(no change) Looking again at the \"Mack\" link above I believe this is what \"average\" will mean.

The largest appears to LG Chem, which in fact has recently formed a new alliance with Tesla and will continue to provide batteries for Tesla vehicles. (Previously Tesla was using Panasonic battery packs.) LG Chem has several battery factories already built, including facilities in Holland, Michigan; Wanxiang, China; and Ochang, Korea. Back in October, LG Chem also announced that it would build a new factory for the European market (supporting its electric vehicle alliance with Renault). This factory will probably take at least two years to come online, judging by the timeline on the Wanxiang factory. http://www.forbes.com/sites/samabuelsamid/2015/10/28/lg-chem-may-be-on-the-verge-of-dominating-ev-battery-industry/#78484927144d http://insideevs.com/lg-chem-build-battery-plant-europe/ http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/LG-Chems-Energy-Storage-Business-Had-a-Good-Year http://www.autonews.com/article/20151214/OEM06/312149992/lg-chem-quietly-surges-in-battery-race While LG Chem is the largest producer, there are still other players in the game including Tesla's former partner Panasonic, NEC Corp, and A123 Systems. What this suggests to me is that there is already a great deal of manufacturing capacity in the game. Assuming that demand for Li-on battery packs does not rise greatly over the next year due to demands  in the vehicle and bulk energy storage markets, I think there is a better than even chance we will see the cost of battery packs drop below $300 per kwh by the end of 2016. \n"], [22539, "2016-04-25T07:11:28Z", [0.1], ""], [23469, "2016-04-25T06:12:57Z", [0.85], ""], [8099, "2016-04-25T06:08:34Z", [0.5], "it went down from about $1000 in 2007 to $450 in 2014, it should continue to go down on a curve so by the end of 2016 it's going to be probably somewhere around $300. these things tend to have a uniformly accelerated motion when it comes to technology."], [12591, "2016-04-25T03:44:36Z", [0.5], ""], [19170, "2016-04-25T03:08:47Z", [0.5], ""], [20911, "2016-04-25T02:28:09Z", [0.4], ""], [24146, "2016-04-25T02:27:50Z", [0.55], "The increased commercial production of these batteries is pushing the cost down"], [53, "2016-04-25T01:16:24Z", [0.45], "This article has a better (larger) copy of the Nature article graph: http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2015/04/13/3646004/electric-car-batteries-price/\nStill not sure if I should perhaps be on just the other side of 50% Noting:\nPotential risk of material cost increases with rapid ramp up of battery demand - not sure that's actually a huge driver\nBolt, with the super-low quoted cost per kWh, is coming in 2017 - not sure if it counts as number on the graph for this year - maybe so, since it's 2017 model year Smattering of info:\nhttp://qnovo.com/82-the-cost-components-of-a-battery/\nhttps://www.nae.edu/Publications/Bridge/133842/134258.aspx\nhttp://news.mit.edu/2015/manufacturing-lithium-ion-battery-half-cost-0623 - potentially eventually useful, not thinking will affect this year though\n"], [23275, "2016-04-25T00:57:22Z", [0.29], ""], [11053, "2016-04-25T00:17:48Z", [0.35], ""], [20347, "2016-04-24T23:36:04Z", [0.65], "Comment deleted on Aug 02, 2016 06:11AM UTC"], [24212, "2016-04-24T23:10:00Z", [0.75], ""], [83, "2016-04-24T22:54:11Z", [0.3], "Since the 14% a year is an average, and the cost reduction is logrithmic, can't really see projecting the same rate for 2015 and 2016.

At 8% annual reduction, the cost in 2016 is expected to be $347/kWh, and using the paper's stated MOE was +/- 8% (which per year means up to a 26% decline), we can still be over 95% confident that it will NOT fall below $300.
