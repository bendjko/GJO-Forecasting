The pound fell 1.7% against the dollar on Friday, to $1.2741, its biggest one-day percentage loss since October. The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against 16 others, rose 0.3%, to 88.51. Mrs. May\u2019s Conservative Party had been widely expected to maintain a majority in Thursday\u2019s general election, though polls had shown the race tightening in recent days. On Friday, she resisted calls to resign and moved to form a new government. Analysts say the election outcome is a mixed bag for the British currency. While investors fear a hung parliament could usher in a fresh period of political uncertainty, the weakened position of the Conservative party could also reduce the likelihood of the \u201chard\u201d Brexit scenario that investors had feared. \u201cMarkets will interpret this general election result as a rejection of Mrs. May\u2019s tough stance in the upcoming negotiations with the EU and consequently view a \u2018soft Brexit\u2019 as more likely,\u201d said analysts at Nomura (para. 1-5).

It is considered likely that US interest rate may rise, which would tend to make the dollar more attractive, but the markets have probably already built that in to the dollar's current price (in fact the dollar might rise in anticipation and fall a little on it actually happening).   Looking at the exchange rates for the last 5 years it is very unusual for the rate to change by 10 cents in the 10 week period. Currently it seems that $1.20 is a point of resistance on the downside and $1.27 seems seems a point of resistance on the upside, so if no significant events happen during the period of this question it seems most probable that it will remain + or - 3 or 4 cents from today's rate.  \nhttp://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=GBP&to=USD&view=1Y"], [15621, "2017-04-10T08:43:42Z", [0.03, 0.11, 0.79, 0.06, 0.01], "Currently 1.24"], [33462, "2017-04-10T03:17:32Z", [0.05, 0.95, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "Combination of worry over Brexit while US increases rates combines to drive pound to 1.20.
