The present law has been in place since 1973.  In the time between then and now, spot oil prices got as high as $150/barrel.  There was a significant depression in the oil industry in the mid-80s.  Through these extremes, this law has not been withdrawn.  IMO, it has been US policy that oil is a strategic commodity, and that exporting refined products is better business.  This has been consistent across time and administrations. 2) Next, consider the timing of the question.  This question closes March 31, 2016.  This is the middle of the US presidential primary season.  While it is possible such legislation could be considered, and perhaps pass the US House of Representatives, between the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) there isn't much oxygen left in the room for yet another trade deal.  In addition, President Obama wants to press a climate-change program.  Assume that both Houses of the US Congress pass legislation, it will be vetoed on this basis alone.  Yes, in a champaign season, just making the proposal might score some political points, but it would cost quite a bit of effort.  For a Representative it might make sense, but it doesn't make sense for Senators.  The US Senate plays a deeper game. 3) Interesting article here: http://www.politico.com/story/2015/12/big-oil-democrats-congress-216443 The take-away is this law is a bargaining chip in the omnibus bill to fund the government.  The timing of these negotiations is a deadline this Friday.  The logic is this: A) Republicans want this law repealed on economic grounds, and B) Democrats would consider repeal if they could get various tax credits for things like clean energy.  I am discounting this for a couple of reasons.  First, the White House has to be part of the negotiations because the final bill has to be signed by the President.  Again, given the UN climate-change conference in November, I don't see Obama signing a bill that includes this.  Second, according to the article, the price demanded by the Democrats may be too high for the Republicans.  Should the omnibus funding bill pass without oil export ban repeal, I will lower my probability significantly. 4) This would make more sense if the price of oil were high.  Right now, the price is low so the economic boost would be muted.  The economic benefit is also somewhat restricted to Alaska, Texas and the northern high plains in the lower-48.  (I might also include oil terminals on the US east and west coasts but there doesn't exist much since it hasn't been possible for 40+ years.)  It would hurt refineries since part of that business would leave the US.  It would also hurt chemical manufacturing since oil and natural gas are feedstock commodities.  So there are other economic interests on the other side of this issue.  I consider this a wash right now. 5) A repeal of this law wouldn\u2019t benefit all producers equally.  Oil from Alaska could easily go to the far east.  Oil from Texas could go to Europe or South America through Gulf of Mexico ports.  There isn't much in the way of transport infrastructure to get oil from the Dakotas anywhere except by rail.  So I don't see a reason to undo the law if only limited benefit is possible.

At a special caucus meeting on Thursday, Senate Democrats solidified a list of asks that Republicans may find overwhelming. But the bright side for the GOP is that Democrats seem serious about striking a bargain on lifting oil exports, despite pressure from greens and resistance from the White House. The challenge for the GOP and its industry allies remains how to craft a deal that lures liberals into backing a pro-oil position without giving away too much for conservatives to swallow. \"Repealing the oil export ban is \"a very important priority for\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), \"and we\u2019re hoping he\u2019ll be respectful of our priorities,\" Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said Thursday. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) is also throwing his weight around, hoping his young speakership's momentum can produce a win in a long-running fight over energy policy that seemed impossible just months ago. \"What Durbin called \"a long list\" of Democratic demands in exchange for any oil exports deal starts with extending clean-energy tax benefits that are anathema to many on the right. But those tax credits are already in line to stay alive this year as part of a separate tax package that's close to completion, and Koch Industries is already pressing lawmakers to reject any deal that would end the ban on oil exports in exchange for helping wind and solar power. \"Democratic leader Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said an end to the export ban is \"obviously being pushed very hard by McConnell, and there are a couple in our caucus that agree, but the price is very high.\u201d The American Petroleum Institute and other top oil players have lent their lobbying might to the effort, scrambling to combat a swoon in oil prices that have forced job cuts and belt-tightening in the once-booming U.S. oil patch. \"We hope Congress will still consider lifting the crude export ban on its own merits, but not by burdening society with continuing subsides and corporate welfare,\" Koch lobbyist Phillip Ellender wrote to lawmakers last week. The letter is viewed with major skepticism among liberal Democrats, who privately wonder whether Republicans are willing to break with the companies run by the billionaire conservative brothers David and Charles Koch. \"However, top Democratic Senate aides said that the party's leaders and even a number of liberal lawmakers are open to a deal with Republicans, but only if they get a lot out of GOP leadership. . . .\"I don't know if they'll be able to get a deal on it,\" said Sen. Jon Tester (Mont.), chief of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, who's been open to a deal on oil exports for months. Tester said \"there needs to be things like\" full funding of the conservation fund to win him over. \"The conservation fund's top Senate Republican backer, Richard Burr (N.C.), said reviving it in exchange for oil exports \"makes a lot of sense.\"\"There are a lot of moving pieces, but the closer we get to finalizing\" a year-end deal, Burr added, \"the more people narrow down their wish list.\" \"Democrats also want assurances from Republicans that child tax credits are preserved and possibly expanded in the tax extenders bill. And they maintain that if they are going to agree to lifting the oil export ban, Republicans should expect little else in the year-end deal. \"Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) was not impressed by the high price the minority party hopes to extract. \"It sounds to me like the Democratic demands are greedy,\" he said. Cornyn's not the only Republican asking why the party should play ball with Minority Leader Harry Reid (Nev.) as Democrats prepare to score victories in the prospective year-end tax package. Adding oil exports to the mix as part of a massive government funding and tax deal \"strikes me as more theater than reality,\" GOP energy lobbyist Michael McKenna said. \"I'm not exactly sure what else Democrats want. Harry Reid is in the process of a getaway from a fairly successful armed robbery.\" \"Still, Democrats have more leverage than Republicans like to admit: They are likely to carry the voting load on the spending bill due by Dec. 11, so they believe they have a strong hand that could trump tough talk from the GOP. \"And the Democrats' biggest environmental stalwarts sounded just as wary of an oil exports deal that they acknowledged is in the mix.\"It\u2019s out there,\" Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) said seconds after complaining the deal would amount for a $500 billion windfall for the oil industry. \"Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.), a centrist dealmaker, raised concerns about northeastern refineries that currently get U.S. crude oil at a discounted price. \"The arguments that we should treat oil much the same as we treat natural gas,\" which the U.S. is gearing up to begin exporting, \"I think flunk,\" he said. \"Given that a spending bill is due within days, the fact that Democrats are keeping the oil concession on the table is being viewed on Capitol Hill as a major development among senators, one of whom said a major, \"substantive\" deal hinges on the provision. \"Yet there's also skepticism about what, exactly, Republicans are asking for. Is the GOP willing to shut the government down if Democrats don't bend to McConnell and Ryan? \u201cPeople are wanting to hold the whole budget process hostage on oil exports,\" lamented Sen.

The nation's biggest refining trade group told the top Senate leader in a letter last week that it strongly opposes any legislation \u201cthat includes subsidies for renewable energy, energy taxes or fees in exchange for lifting the crude oil export ban.\u201d And the American Energy Alliance, backed by the billionaire Koch brothers, has warned it won't tolerate the dealmaking, despite its ongoing campaign to dismantle the 40-year-old ban on exporting U.S. crude. The group, the political arm of the Institute for Energy Research, has long fought against the production tax credit for wind power. It lapsed at the start of this year. Oil exports \u201cwould be great for a whole host of reasons,\u201d said Thomas Pyle, president of the alliance. \u201cBut saddling rate payers with higher electricity costs is not a tradeoff to me.\u201d \"The warnings arrive as oil producers lobbying for the freedom to widely export crude look for ways to propel the trade policy change through the narrowly divided Senate.

Even if they get a filibuster-proof majority, oil producers and their allies on Capitol Hill are challenged by an end-of-the-year legislative bottleneck. With a tight Senate calendar and competing interests, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell may not be willing to bring a stand-alone exports bill to the floor this year. That has some export advocates looking at possible deals to propel the issue. \"One of the most talked-about options is tying exports to the wind production tax credit and possibly also a separate investment tax credit for solar power that is set to expire Dec. 31 next year. But that combination could bleed off as many Republican votes as it gains in Democrats, because the credits are not popular with fiscal conservatives. \"Oil exports also could be paired with a re-authorization an expansion and reauthorization of the 50-year-old Land and Water Conservation Fund that helps pay for new federal land acquisitions and recreational areas.  \". . . Some Democrats also have floated the idea of a new per-barrel production tax on crude that is viewed as a non-starter by the same oil producers campaigning so ardently for exports. \"The American Petroleum Institute and other groups pushing for oil exports say they prefer the Senate advance clean legislation to end the trade restrictions.  But when pressed by reporters, API President Jack Gerard would not rule out a deal that ties exports to the wind tax credit or other policies.

Two oil export amendments have been teed up for possible consideration when the House of Representatives next week takes up legislation that would reauthorize federal highway and transit programs for six years. The highway bill is seen as one of just a few must-pass measures on Congress\u2019 agenda this year, making it a prime candidate for unrelated provisions, like the crude exports proposals. The highway bill also is a top priority for lawmakers, as it funds major infrastructure and transportation projects nationwide. \"The Senate has already passed its own long-term highway bill without an oil export provision. If the House voted to add language authorizing widespread oil exports, the issue would be negotiated by a joint House-Senate conference committee made up of Democrats and Republicans from both chambers. The tactic has major political benefits \u2014 if export language is added to the House transportation bill and then survives a conference committee, the Senate would never take a vote solely on the issue. Instead, the chamber would be presented with the final compromise transportation bill \u2014 in the form of a conference report \u2014 and asked to vote the whole thing up or down. \"The strategy also could make it more difficult for President Barack Obama to go through with a threatened veto of oil exports legislation.

The National Wildlife Federation CEO says, \"This thing is moving fairly quickly . . .\".  His group and other conservation groups are opposing lifting the ban because it would make fracking more profitable and lead to drilling on new acreage.  They are proposing all sorts of \"sweeteners\" from full funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund, billions of dollars for state wildlife projects and extension of clean energy tax credits, to a permanent ban on offshore drilling or a wilderness designation on the coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge, and even rail safety or getting Iran to pay US victims of terrorist attacks. \"Democrats who are viewed as potential pickups for exports who may also go to bat for lands and clean energy include Sens. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, Michael Bennet of Colorado and Jon Tester of Montana. \"Tester voted against the export bill before the banking panel yesterday but said he's game for a discussion about a broader package that invests in renewable energy and permanently reauthorizes and fully funds the Land and Water Conservation Fund. \"I think this bill has real merit, but we need to have a more thorough discussion,\" Tester said. \"The exports push still faces tall odds of becoming law, considering the opposition from the White House and most Democrats and the panoply of add-ons lawmakers of both parties are proposing, running the gamut from language on renewable fuel standards to victims of Iranian-sponsored terror. \"ClearView Energy Partners LLC, a Washington, D.C.-based firm that advises clients on energy policy, says there's a 15 percent chance the export ban will be lifted during the 114th Congress.\n. . . \n\"The debate over crude exports has such big economic and energy security implications that it is unlikely green groups are going to have major clout, said Paul Bledsoe, president of the energy consultancy Bledsoe & Associates and a former Interior Department official in the Clinton administration. \"Environmental groups are not going to drive or determine whether this deal gets done,\" he said. \"Nor is it a high priority for them.\" \"But Democrats see exports as a major deal-making opportunity, Bledsoe said. Members of both parties have talked about increasing funding for clean energy research and development, a provision that could represent a \"sweet spot\" that could allay Democratic concerns over climate change without turning off Republicans, Bledsoe said. \"Senate Energy and Natural Resources Chairwoman Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said yesterday she hadn't read the conservation proposals put forth by NWF's O'Mara but that she's encouraged conservationists are willing to come to the table. \"I think this is good because what it indicates is a willingness to engage,\" she told E&E Daily. Murkowski said she spoke this week with representatives of conservation groups during a Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus dinner who said they'd like to discuss crude exports further. \"I told them to come by, let's sit down,\" she said. \"But Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), who is in talks with the Obama administration about lifting the ban, was lukewarm about NWF's wish list. \"I thought it was aggressive,\" she told E&E Daily after the Senate Banking Committee approved her bill (S. 1372) to end the ban (Greenwire, Oct. 1). \"I think everybody sees this as an opportunity to have a broader discussion,\" she said, noting that Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) used yesterday's markup to \"re-litigate\" the Iran agreement through an amendment that would keep sanctions in place until Teheran pays judgments awarded to U.S. victims of terrorism attacks (E&E Daily, Sept. 25). \"If we re-litigate or pile on all of this, nothing will get done. And I think that's bad for energy independence, I think it's bad for our economy long term, and I think it's horrible national security policy,\" Heitkamp said. \"Heitkamp said she's encouraged by her Democratic colleagues who have signaled they could support ending the ban as part of a broader energy push -- a position echoed by Sens. Mark Warner (D-Va.), Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.) and Tester during the markup, although she was the only Democrat to vote for ending the ban. \"I believe there's a number of people in my caucus, I like to put it this way: They get it, they get the economics of this,\" Heitkamp said. \"They get the challenging economics that we're having right now at $45 a barrel. But they want to know what they can get for it.\" \"During the markup, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) acknowledged that changes in U.S. crude export policy may be warranted but said lawmakers should first hear from scientists about the climate effects of doing so. \"And for those who listen to these scientists, lifting the ban without further considering and addressing the potential environmental consequences sounds pretty darn reckless,\" Warren said. \"However, export backers are pursuing all legislative avenues to see one of their top priorities advance. \"Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who yesterday suggested a crude exports repeal could end up as a policy rider in an end-of-the-year omnibus spending bill under discussion to replace the continuing resolution in December, said he doesn't see a repeal clearing the chamber on its own.  \"My guess is there's at least a possibility that as part of negotiations toward Dec. 11 -- possibility -- that a policy change like this could be something that ends up being a rider,\" he told E&E Daily yesterday. \"I mean, I'm not in that discussion, but it's possible. I don't think we're going to pass a standalone bill on the floor relative to exportation in the very near future. \"  Corker said he would oppose the inclusion of a repeal in exchange for higher spending levels sought by Democrats but would consider other policy changes as part of a deal. \"That's what happens in legislation, right?\" he said. \"Murkowski isn't ruling out that option.  \"I've got multiple tracks going,\" she told E&E Daily. \"I've got the legislative track, we're trying to work it through the administration with the waivers, and if we can use the approps process, I think that's a viable alternative.\"\n~~~~~~~\nhttp://celebcafe.org/senate-panel-passes-bill-to-lift-united-states-oil-export-ban-future-uncertain-8806/ Oct 2.  \"John Hoeven, R-N.D., who serves on the Energy Committee. \u201cIf too much renewable energy stuff gets attached it could ruin the bill.

It analyzed the match between U.S. crude and where it will likely flow if the export ban is lifted. Using \u201ca variety of fundamental and commercial factors,\u201d the study concludes: \u201cthe large majority of crude exported from the U.S. in an open market environment would stay in the Atlantic basin, flowing to refineries in Europe and other Western Hemisphere markets.\u201d The rationale revolves around the type of crude oil needed for refineries.\" \"U.S. \u201clight tight oil\u201d is a good fit for refineries that depend on declining supplies from the North Sea and the increasingly volatile Russian source. Surprisingly, Israel is one of the Russian-oil-dependent countries.\nOn page 27, the study states:   \u201cWorld oil markets do not always operate in a pure economic fashion,\n  and there are many other factors that influence crude trade flows.\n  Much of this owes to the fact that national oil companies and cartels\n  (OPEC) are major players in crude markets, and often prioritize\n  political, foreign relation or national security goals above\n  economics. As evidenced by the current U.S. export restrictions,\n  government policy can have major impacts on crude flows even in\n  countries where the oil industry is not nationally controlled. As a\n  result, geopolitical factors and events (i.e., conflicts, sanctions)\n  have historically had a great impact on crude oil supply and demand\n  and have greatly impacted crude flows for years, and this will\n  continue to be the case in the future.\u201d\n. . .  \" . . . you may not have known, Russia is a leading supplier of crude oil to Israel. \" \"The study points out the geopolitics: \u201cMost Middle East producers (with the exception of semi-autonomous Iraqi Kurdistan) refuse to provide crude to Israel.\u201d Israel currently satisfies its demand, approximately 250,000 barrels per day, with Russian oil.\" \"If the White House\u2014and Senators like Schatz\u2014really wants to find new ways to help Israel, lifting the 40-year-old oil export ban should be a no-brainer.
