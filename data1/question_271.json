This is a report of current discussions about how this might be accomplished.  Frankly, it sounds to me like well-meaning talk that will amount to zilch. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/04/us-uk-explore-possibility-aid-airdrops-syria-drones \"The US and UK have been holding talks to explore ways to airdrop food and medical supplies to eastern Aleppo and other besieged populations in Syria. The talks have been going on for months . . .  the discussions have been mired in disagreements between government agencies, the reluctance of the military to get involved and concern among officials that flying in aid without permission from the Damascus regime and its allies could hamper conventional humanitarian deliveries. . . . But by the time the meeting took place almost half of eastern Aleppo had been overrun, and there were fears that by the time any drone-borne aid finally took to the air, there would be no one there left to save. . . . Syrian government forces have taken control of more than half of Aleppo\u2019s rebel districts after fierce bombardments and ground advances forced tens of thousands to flee last week. \". . .  \u201cThere are discussions about a convoy . . . . But it would need GoS [Government of Syria] and Russian approval to pass all checkpoints and thus have the same fate as the UN convoys unless GoS and Russia was part of the effort,\u201d . . .. Meanwhile, traditional airdrops from military transport planes would have to be carried out at such high altitudes to avoid anti-aircraft missiles that they would be worse than useless.\n\u201cUnfortunately airdrops cannot be done on a heavily populated urban area. We could hurt as many as we helped . . . .The contents of the drops would liquify on the way down, and they would most likely miss their target, destroy buildings or kill the people they are supposed to save,\u201d said an official involved in the Washington talks. \"Two engineering graduates from Aleppo University . . . have called for the use of guided parachute drops which have cameras and navigation equipment on the aid pallets, allowing an aircraft to fly at 35,000ft (10,670 metres) and drop its payload up to 100km (62 miles) from the intended target.  \u201cThere has been a shameful indifference towards imposing a no-fly zone that could still save thousands of lives. Let\u2019s not make safe airdrops of aid another missed opportunity,\u201d they said in a public appeal on Friday. \"Advocates of humanitarian drones argue that even small payloads of medical supplies can have a dramatic impact in helping besieged civilians survive a siege, and that significant quantities of food can be flown in by drones in an air bridge, with a hundred or more flights operating day and night. \"The commercially made drones discussed at the UK embassy meeting could carry payloads of 2kg to 50kg. For use in a conflict zone like Syria they could be programmed to randomise their flight path, altering altitude and direction in unpredictable ways so they would be harder to shoot down. The guidance circuitry could also self-destruct in the event of a crash, so it could not be used as a weapon if it fell into the wrong hands. The use of unmanned aircraft for delivering humanitarian aid is still in its infancy, however. . . .  edible drones was one of the options discussed. \"This is not the first attempt to organise unmanned aid drops into Syria. In 2014, a US-led team of volunteers attempted to build a fleet of low-budget drones that could be locally assembled and used to get aid to besieged communities in Syria. The initiative, the Syria Airlift Project, folded in December 2015, after technical problems and a lack of funding. \"Now there is strong interest from some parts of the US and UK governments in a large-scale drone airlift, but there are still significant obstacles. Most of the drone flights would have to take off from Turkey and would need Ankara\u2019s permission. The technology is also only just being field tested, and it is unclear whether flying in aid against the will of the Syrian government and Russia would lead them to block conventional land deliveries that might otherwise have got through. . . .  \u201cBut non-action is no longer an option.\u201d"], [38, "2016-12-06T03:54:27Z", [0.0, 0.89, 0.11, 0.0], "It's all bad news for the rebels in Aleppo.

Primary Driver for moving down on Nov 30 - this excerpt from the latest ISW assessment: \"Russian airstrikes and concerted pro-regime ground operations concentrated against opposition-held terrain in the southern, central, and northern districts of Aleppo City in order to fix opposition forces along multiple fronts and hinder the movement of opposition reinforcements within the city. These successive and simultaneous operations are a hallmark of Russian campaign design and facilitated pro-regime advances in the northern outskirts of Aleppo City as well as some limited territorial gains near the city center. Russian air power alone likely will not enable pro-regime forces to recapture the densely-populated urban terrain of Aleppo City. Rather, the regime and Iran will have to deploy more combat-effective ground forces in order to leverage the asymmetric effect of the Russian air campaign to clear Aleppo City of the Syrian opposition.\"\nhttp://iswresearch.blogspot.com/search/label/Syria I'd anticipate any successful talks between the US and Russia to be around a ceasefire and aid as we've seen before with Aleppo; but unless the agreement were qualitatively different, and assuming the recent past is precedent, we could expect continued maneuvering by Syrian and Russian troops in preparation for a large ground assault. Perhaps I should go down even further on the Nov 30 bucket  given the low-confidence reporting of Russian airstrikes in the latest ISW reporting cycle, but many of their reporting cycles have been dominated by such sources (largely secondary sources). It may also take time to get the heavier equipment there, but that's also assuming the campaign designers make the same assumption as ISW in that it is indeed necessary.

It only plays the role of hand-maiden to the legacy colonial powers of the UK and France. It would also be a mistake to lay the blame for the fiasco that is Syria exclusively upon the current CIA crop. They have only picked up the program where their predecessors left off. I wonder if history will ever reveal the name(s) whose bright idea idea such a program was to begin with, sometime around the mid-to-late late seventies or early eighties I would guess, and those who connived with its promulgation. There are so many lessons as to policy formation, organizational inertia, and informal dominance without accountability here. It seems that it is the same \"failure to appreciate divergent payoffs\" again. [It's a truly difficult challenge (for me at least), to consistently remind oneself that the same outcome yields different payoffs to different players!] Unless we are to assume irrationality in the decision-makers, who are obviously some grouping that spans various political administrations, a wholly different notion of what \"success\" is must exist for those that are in the position to maintain this program which, to the uniformed mind, appears to yield only decades upon decades of nothing but total disaster. The hysterical diplomatic rhetoric is at a fevered pitch.

Not to be outdone, however, the Russians return a charge of the U.S. sponsoring \"villains,\" while THIS is the very role Russia has carved out for itself in the globalized future.

Here, through the smokescreen, Mr. Owen calls for it to be implemented. There are just so many problems with this plan, however, for it to even warrant serious consideration. First, the U.S. and the rest of the Western colonial powers should not even be involved with Syria in the first place. Despite six years of looking, no \"moderate opposition\" are to be found (and why are there even such pains being taken to find them *here*?). The rebels are comprised of twenty-five or more various bands and groupings, but they share the commonality that they are all radical jihadists. Recently I saw an interview with a scholar from the Middle East Institute, where he mentioned that each of these twenty five or so groups have offices in Istanbul, where presumably they meet with various Western intelligence contacts to work out supply logistics and military operations. One can only assume that they have been in Turkey for the duration, and have obtained succor and protection from Turkey. It has always been through Turkey that the arms-for-oil transactions with the radical jihadists, co-ordinated by the CIA, have been staged. Turkey is just a hand-maiden to the Western powers, and Erdo\u011fan won't sneeze without their permission. So the coy \"Oh, what do we have here?\" attitude of Mr. Owen about Turkey just happening to be so well-positioned for potential intervention is a bunch of bunk. As was, of course, the entire faux-coup; which allows Erdo\u011fan to sell out the citizenry of Turkey in this imperialistic endeavor without fear of opposition.  Let the rest of the Western powers continue on the same old colonial legacy path of driving regime change in any hapless country that happens to possess resources they want or manages to evidence some bit of independence. This is not the direction the United States should be taking if it desires to hold a legitimate leadership role in the twenty first century. Second, the notion that NATO is to be expanding its OFFENSIVE activities even further (it already is providing AWACS and other assets to the coalition), presaged by Trump in the recent presidential debates, should be worrisome to every American. Did we just skip over that debate? Does the United States even wish to be a part of such an OFFENSIVE alliance? Do you think that the majority of the American public would wish for this? The war-mongers are frenetic in championing anything, including implementation of Plan B, in order to not give up their [I don't know what else to call it but] imperialist ambition to topple Assad and break up Syria into partitions; because, well, they want to and they can. I'm thinking that some decision as to Plan B should be made just about the same time as the offensive for Mosul begins. That way, if the decision to go ahead with Plan B is forthcoming, it can always be positioned as a brilliant military pincer-type operation pressuring the oh-so-scary boogeyman ISIS from two directions simultaneously. Update: Apparently Plan B has sub-plan B as well. lol.\n41K Turkish soldiers ready to support operation Al Bab\nhttp://www.yenisafak.com/en/world/41k-turkish-soldiers-ready-to-support-operation-al-bab-2535329 Previous speculation ( http://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/326897 ) that al-Bab was a \"supply depot / staging area for eastern Aleppo\" confirmed. The relevant supplies, of course, are those that have been \"smuggled\" (is it still smuggling if it's condoned?) through Turkey, orchestrated by CIA logistical operatives, transshipped via Montenegro, from arms manufactured in Eastern Europe, paid for by Saudi Arabia and Qatar, upon the direction of the U.K. and French. So in many respects nothing in Syria has changed except that the veil of covert proxies is growing ever more thin. The whole Turkey supply and support operation of ISIS is now out in the open. That the Western alliance has been arming and encouraging radical jihadist proxies to topple Assad and partition Syria is also now at about the same place the semantic falsehood of \"No combat boots on the ground\" was six months ago. I do not believe it was worth the price (trillions upon trillions of dollars and tens of thousands of lives), but the U.S. citizenry is catching on to how the rhetoric has been fashioned into a weapon and used against them by those privileged to serve themselves, er the country, in this administration. An administration spokesperson recently broke down, stating something along the lines of: \"Yes, there are U.S. combat soldiers, wearing boots, walking on the ground in Syria.\" It's a hollow victory for epistemic clarity, and it's sad and disgraceful seeing a fifty year old man basically admitting to having his hand in the cookie jar without permission. This is the adult nature of the so-called leadership of the United States. Kerry recently stated that he did not believe the U.S. Congress was up to \"going to war in Syria.\" By this I presume he meant providing the authorization to do so, for the U.S. is already at war there, and is doing so without any explicit congressional authority. Just as in the recently alleged WIPO cyber espionage case, where some series of transactions were supposedly structured to avoid going through the routine U.N. contracting procedures (and thereby avoiding scrutiny), the use of clandestine paramilitary and proxy forces in Syria is a way to circumvent congressional authorization that is the check upon unbridled exercise of executive power. The U.S. congress is quite hypocritical in (rightfully) lambasting the CEO of Wells Fargo for defrauding shareholders while simultaneously (wrongfully) conniving with the administration to likewise defraud the American public as to Syria.

So the question is what would stop Aleppo being totally destroyed? The answer is that to capture Aleppo requires either the total surrender or the destruction of the anti-government forces. Surrender does not sound like a safe option unless it was part of a general peace deal and included guarantees from countries more trustworthy than Russia and the Syrian Government. At the moment this option does not exist/ This leaves the total destruction of of the anti-government forces as the only current option. The total destruction of the anti-government forces requires ground troops to take Aleppo, yard by yard.  If Russia were to supply a large number of ground troops it could trigger public unease in Russia (people remember Afghanistan) so that means ground troops would need to be from the Syrian army and Iran and its militia allies. They no doubt have some fighters, but after all the years of war in Syria how much longer will they be willing to die for the glory of killing fellow Muslims?

The dramatic uptick in Russian airstrikes coincided with the Syrian Arab Army's announcement of the start of an offensive to seize the remaining opposition-held districts of Aleppo City on September 22, demonstrating Russia's continued commitment to support pro-regime operations against the Syrian opposition. Russian strikes concentrated against opposition-held terrain in the southern districts of Aleppo City as well as in the city's western countryside, marking the largest three-day surge in Russian airstrikes against the city and its environs since mid-August. Russian warplanes reportedly conducted several airstrikes using cluster or incendiary munitions, including an alleged wave of incendiary attacks against opposition frontlines south of Aleppo City, while regime jets also intensified their bombardment of the city and its suburbs. The surge in Russian strikes defied U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's demand on September 21 that pro-regime forces \"immediately ground all aircraft\" flying over opposition-held areas in order to \"restore credibility\" to U.S.-Russian negotiations on the Syrian Civil War. Russia has periodically intensified and tempered its air operations in Aleppo Province during negotiations with the U.S., wielding the threat of even deeper humanitarian crisis and the defeat of the acceptable opposition in Aleppo City in order to extract concessions. Russia will not accede to a partnership with the U.S. except on its own terms, and will continue to wage its air campaign in Syria coercively in order to secure them.  http://understandingwar.org/backgrounder/syria-situation-report-september-8-22-2016?utm_source=Syria+Situation+Report%3A+September+8+-+22%2C+2016&utm_campaign=Syria+Situation+Report%3A+September+8+-+22%2C+2016&utm_medium=email By: ISW Syria Team and Syria Direct\nViolence in Aleppo City spiked to new highs after the collapse of a nationwide 'cessation of hostilities' on September 19. The ceasefire marked a core component of a wide-ranging deal on the Syrian Civil War reached by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on September 9. The deal called for the implementation of a meaningful 'cessation of hostilities' and unimpeded humanitarian access to all besieged and hard-to-reach regions starting on September 12. If sustained for seven continuous days, the U.S. and Russia would establish a Joint Implementation Center (JIC) in order to share intelligence and coordinate airstrikes against both ISIS and Jabhat Fatah al-Sham - the successor of Syrian Al-Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra. Although diplomats expressed hope that the deal could allow a return to political negotiations to end the conflict, the deal lacked a concrete enforcement mechanism and almost immediately suffered from regular violations committed by both sides. The regime also continued to block humanitarian access to opposition-held districts of Eastern Aleppo City despite the terms of the agreement. The deal also suffered significant blows following an accidental coalition airstrike against pro-regime forces outside Deir ez-Zour City on September 17 and a suspected pro-regime airstrike against a UN humanitarian convoy outside Aleppo City on September 19. International powers failed to reach a consensus on the path forward to restore the ceasefire during an acrimonious UN Security Council Meeting as well as two separate meetings of the International Syria Support Group between September 20 and September 22. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has called for the immediate grounding of all military flights over opposition-held regions as the only measure sufficient to restore the ceasefire, while Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has offered vague support for a new series of temporary truces. No initiative appears likely to prevent the ongoing escalation, pointing towards a new wave of violence that will benefit ISIS, Jabhat Fatah al-Sham, and other Salafi-Jihadist Groups. \nThis graphic marks the latest installment of our Syria SITREP Map made possible through a partnership between the Institute for the Study of War and Syria Direct.

They've swallowed the anti-Assad propaganda and are feeling an emotional loss in seeing the conflict resolve itself it a way they were led to believe not to desire.

Update#1: US Says It May Have Struck Syrian Troops While Targeting IS\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2016/09/17/world/middleeast/ap-ml-syria.html\nhttp://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/09/17/us-halts-air-raid-after-learning-syrian-forces-may-have-been-hit.html These allegations now seem confirmed. The size and composition of the Syrian force, and the extent and timing of the strike, simply makes the claim of error here highly doubtful. The U.S. would (should) have better targeting intelligence than that. We are left to consider the possibility that, as a result of the dire predicament of the coalition supported anti-Assad forces in eastern Aleppo, and the panic which surrounds the failure to deliver (military) resupply to them, the U.S. has intentionally undertaken this attack upon Syrian troops as an oh-so-clever \"disguised\" message of displeasure to (and attempt at intimidation of) Assad. It's (possibly) a brazen (and risky) escalation of the Syrian conflict, which, whether it causes Assad to let the convoys to eastern Aleppo go through without inspection or not, diminishes overall U.S. credibility. As in so many of the country-specific instances of corruption we've touched upon in GJO, we may again be seeing the same old trick of \"incompetence\" invoked to cover \"intention.\" Such instances, in any case, strain (reduce) credibility. Update#2: UN Security Council holds emergency meeting to discuss the \"errant\" airstrikes\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2016/09/17/middleeast/syria-claims-coalition-airstrike-hit-regime-forces/ After this incident it will be hard to make the case that failure to coordinate ISIS targeting more intimately with Russia is not mere wanton disregard for human life. It's just simply unbelievable that the U.S. should be in such a position to endure such charges in a country for which there has been no congressional authority to invade. It's also possible, however, that this is an extremely well-planned trick by Russia which induced the U.S. into the error. While possible, in that it was the U.S. that initiated the attack, and the Russians could not directly determine that timing (although they could have influenced it indirectly), and that a very sophisticated set of deceptions (including upon the sacrificial Syrians) would have had to have been involved, I find this possibility to be less likely than the possibility of simple error even, which I find less likely than the possibility of \"intentional mistake\" to deliver a threat to Assad. Well, a definite hit at the UN again on credibility, and maybe the first step down the road to an eventual outcome where Russia sets the targets for U.S. airstrikes. \"how [The U.S.] could have thought it was striking an ISIS target is unclear\"\nhttp://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/09/18/did-the-u-s-just-slaughter-syrian-troops.html \"a potentially illegal act by the United States in a country in which they have not been invited or declared war\" Failed policy supported by failed plans from a bunch of old ladies who are panicking.

I wonder if those who have bemoaned the legacy of the Syckes-Picot agreement feel similarly about this externally imposed US-Russian agreement? While the unpopulist media continue to neglect the point specifically, I maintain that the crux of the issue is whether or not the purported humanitarian aid convoys will be allowed to be searched by Syrian forces so as to prevent weapons and ammunition from reaching the rebels in eastern Aleppo. I also maintain that the so-called Western alliance is so desperate and frenetic to achieve this (presumed) *military* resupply of those rebels that the U.S. is now spearheading a Turkish armor movement to break through to Aleppo so as to deliver the weapons themselves. [Relax. The U.S troops were mounted. No boots-on-the-ground.] As propaganda approaches reality, the propaganda always gives way (\"facts are stubborn things\" -- John Adams). Forget all the fake narratives of no U.S. combat troops, \"moderate\" opposition allies, ISIS as the \"main enemy\" (in Syria it's Assad), weapons smuggling from gosh nobody-knows-where, and humanitarian aid. Here comes the armor! Update: \"The United Nations insisted Thursday that the government would not be allowed to pick through any of the aid items headed to Aleppo.\" Finally, the issue is addressed head on (four days late), but with a definite anti-Assad bias. OK, the concern of the UN has been expressed (no pilfering of food or medical supplies). Sounds good. Now what about the concerns of the Syrians (no weapons)? What's to be done about that? If there were bonafide intentions to deliver humanitarian aid (only), these issues would have been worked out and this negotiation would be done. [With such blatant bias on the part of the UN here, skeptical me is now thinking that the spattered news stories of the previous week about how the local NGOs were captive to the Assad regime* were just taking reality (they are actually captive to the Western alliance), and turning it around as a propaganda narrative, to cover their own bias (and, imagine, *in anticipation of this current contingency*). Those rebels must be in very tough straits, for both the Obama administration and the U.N. (and for what it's worth, the WaPo) are taking gigantic credibility hits on this operation.]\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/syria-has-not-granted-a-single-permit-to-aid-besieged-aleppo-says-un-official/2016/09/15/a3bde87e-7ab6-11e6-8064-c1ddc8a724bb_story.html * For fun, we could take as a defeasible assumption that the spattered news stories relating to the NGOs were planted, and we could identify the network of propagandist mouthpieces that proliferated those stories.

The CIA has acted as co-ordinator for this monstrosity of a scheme. The Kurds threatened to cutoff the smuggling route, so Turkey needed to invade overtly to keep it open.

The critical aspect of whether any so-called relief convoys are to be allowed to transit \"unhindered,\" or will be searched for weapons and ammunition, goes unaddressed by the unpopulist media. At the moment it's all about the *contents* of those convoys, not the road they are to travel upon. This proxy war is being obfuscated and the American public is to remain in the dark and led by the nose. And then, at some point in the future, the public goes: \"Hey, how'd we get here?\" [Movement from Point A to Point X unopposed -- reflexive control -- a Soviet infowar tactic being applied by the U.S. government against its own citizens (via weaponized information). The American public is being *attacked* by their very own government and they are oblivious to the fact. The harm inflicted (the immediate effect of the force) is in the form of belief-structure displacement. The pain (which will follow) is disassociated in time.] The U.S. is presently so desperate to allow this delivery of weapons to anti-Assad forces in eastern Aleppo that they are likely to sell out some other ally or foundational principle of the Republic in order to twist the arm of Russia to sell out Assad and let those military supply convoys go through \"unhindered.\" For example, \"You want Crimea? How about Crimea and $500 billion? Just get Assad to let that friggin' weapons convoy go through!\" The U.S., and the rest of the imperialist coalition allies, are desperate and there is real risk that they're likely to give away the store to retain this anti-Assad foothold in eastern Aleppo.

Today, we learn that Syria is doing the same. Turkey now won't let the convoy roll because it likely does not in fact contain the humanitarian aid that it claimed, but war materials instead. Else, why not let it roll? But, it's not so much that the convoy is a re-supply of weapons and arms to the terrorist rebels and ISIS; most of us knew this to be the case. What's the real issue is that *it was this very re-supply convoy* that brought the Russians and the U.S. into agreement. The western coalition *needs* this war material convoy to get through, for without it the rebels and ISIS can't hold out for even a fortnight. It's desperate, dire straights, and immediately it's all about this convoy. Everything, in terms of prolonging the Aleppo battle, rests on that (weapons) convoy getting through. So, to call out the contents of the convoy is not the same as actually stopping and inspecting the convoy.

Consider the siege of Darayya a smaller suburb of Damascus that has been besieged since 2012 and it only ended recently after an evacuation deal. There were around 700 rebels there. I have no doubt there are plenty of rebels very, very determined to fight Assad till the bitter end considering all that has been done these past years. The Assad side does not have the quality manpower needed to storm the city or prefers to conserve it. Base chance 0% of the city falling to Assad before 30 November 2017 compared to Darayya. I'm not even taking into account the many, many things that could make things become much more complicated or difficult for Assad. So what is increasing chances for Assad?\n- Russian bombing, the years of agony, Shiite manpower and the loss of hope for foreign support may finally lead to a rebel collapse. I'll just give a ~5% chance per period. \n- The number of civilians left in East Aleppo may actually make it harder for rebels to resist due to what little food supplies are left will run out quicker.

At present, I'm thinking that Obama won't make the sort of concession Putin requires to close down the offensive because Obama can still make the case that the loss of Aleppo is not, in itself, the end of the larger strategic vision (of splitting Syria). Although no references have been provided, I find the analysis by @Censusguyz  ( http://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/315492 ) to be both plausible and convincing; and I am building my forecast upon that. And, although It is my bad to accept such an analysis without verification, I'm going to bet on the speculation that a deal of sorts has been made with Assad which includes his regime regaining complete control of Aleppo. Who exactly this deal has been made with I do not know, but I'm thinking that both Turkey and Russia are on the inside and that the U.S.-led coalition is, at least in terms their publicly stated position regarding Aleppo, on the outside. That Turkish troops are running around Syria without Assad screaming about it is the evidence I am using to support my position. A ceasefire or Turkey making some unanticipated move could screw up the timetable, but otherwise I'm thinking that the anti-Assad resistance in Aleppo is fated to complete surrender shortly. I'm also thinking that if all the U.S. has to offer Russia is \"shared intelligence,\" this will be insufficient to obtain any meaningful ceasefire. The future actions of Turkey are a big wild card, and whether they act as an agent of the U.S., Russia, somehow both, or a wholly autonomous entity (not likely), is a major source of uncertainty.\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/world/us-still-trying-for-a-syria-ceasefire-deal-with-russia/2016/09/05/c56d710a-72ec-11e6-9781-49e591781754_story.html\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-russia-usa-idUSKCN1182OJ\nhttp://www.nst.com.my/news/2016/09/170817/ousted-turkey-border-syria-army-besieges-aleppo"], [28225, "2016-09-05T20:15:39Z", [0.45, 0.51, 0.04, 0.0], ""], [20588, "2016-09-05T19:58:07Z", [0.4, 0.1, 0.1, 0.4], "This is either going to take forever, or it'll be over soon."], [7513, "2016-09-05T17:37:49Z", [0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.97], ""], [7513, "2016-09-05T15:54:47Z", [0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.97], "Not possible anymore "], [28767, "2016-09-05T09:05:34Z", [0.1, 0.2, 0.35, 0.35], ""], [21884, "2016-09-05T08:53:37Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.7], ""], [28755, "2016-09-04T20:42:55Z", [0.15, 0.39, 0.2, 0.26], ""], [27798, "2016-09-04T19:24:53Z", [0.07, 0.68, 0.22, 0.03], ""], [28634, "2016-09-04T19:15:19Z", [0.05, 0.15, 0.35, 0.45], ""], [1593, "2016-09-04T17:06:37Z", [0.1, 0.4, 0.25, 0.25], ""], [10759, "2016-09-04T16:10:30Z", [0.1, 0.25, 0.25, 0.4], ""], [4634, "2016-09-04T16:10:10Z", [0.1, 0.25, 0.25, 0.4], ""], [28225, "2016-09-04T15:36:24Z", [0.21, 0.75, 0.04, 0.0], ""], [13979, "2016-09-04T14:37:57Z", [0.05, 0.45, 0.35, 0.15], ""], [28504, "2016-09-04T13:33:21Z", [0.55, 0.25, 0.2, 0.0], ""], [93, "2016-09-03T16:58:03Z", [0.65, 0.35, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [15548, "2016-09-03T05:36:44Z", [0.1, 0.35, 0.3, 0.25], ""], [28737, "2016-09-03T04:12:31Z", [0.1, 0.35, 0.4, 0.15], ""], [15196, "2016-09-03T03:28:15Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.45, 0.55], ""], [1646, "2016-09-02T22:20:31Z", [0.0, 0.85, 0.0, 0.15], ""], [28734, "2016-09-02T22:03:10Z", [0.05, 0.35, 0.35, 0.25], ""], [28731, "2016-09-02T19:58:34Z", [0.05, 0.19, 0.27, 0.49], "I find it 5% likely that the SAA with Russian air support will take back Aleppo before 30 November as the rebels are currently on the offensive. This is despite Russian air power involvement. Indications have been made over the summer that the US is allowing the groups that they back support to participate in the battle for Aleppo, increasing the tactical advantage with TOW missiles that those groups possess. As for the period between 1 December 2016 and 31 May 2017, I think that more regional and global factors will come into play. Assuming that both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will have take a \"harsher\" stance on ISIS, then I believe will this stance will translate into a more active US role in Syria, even moreso than the current indications. I believe there is a small likelihood that the US and Russia will start to coordinate air power efforts in Syria and Iraq against ISIS, which in turn will not translate into leaving their respective proxies alone, so Russian air power support for the SAA would continue. In sum I think the likelihood of SAA retaking Aleppo will be higher in this period, however the rebels would need to be weakened over a long period of time for this to happen. Predicting 1 June 2017 to 30 November 2017 is a lot more difficult, but as has been seen over the last 5 years in the Syrian conflict - making predictions a year in advance has been very hard. Though using logical deduction, if it is less likely to happen in the near future, this does not mean it is unlikely to happen through a longer perspective.  Given the information at hand, and since this is my first prediction, retaking Aleppo will more likely happen over a year from now than in the next 6-8 months.
