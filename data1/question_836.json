MTM called for jihadist to join the fight in the Congo in late 2017 and some reports link the ADF to al Qaeda. The confidence is only a 40% due to the 1,000 fatality standard. Congo is full of natural resources but is among the poorest of nations, and thus lacks sufficient government resources and security. This yields an unstable environment, prime for ethnic conflict over resources. The last Congo war drew multiple African countries into the conflict and resulted in millions of deaths.\nCurrently, the Congo is once again experiencing heated uprisings. One example includes the DRC waging war against the Eastern rebels- ADF and Yukutumba. If a multi-country African war were to take place, a key difference from the last war would be the rise in Militant Islam in Africa. ISIS and al Qaeda are more abundant in Africa than ever before, and could seek to take advantage of the conflict by immersing their name with rebel groups to increase propaganda, recruitment, and funding for their global caliphate. A mass casualty event would attract the attention and media force multiplier they seek, so it is possible a transnational jihadist group would organize a mass causality event through a smaller rebel group.
