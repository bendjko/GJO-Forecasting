But I'm pretty sure that we're not in much jeopardy yet. At any rate, what passes for data in this election still strongly favors Museveni, including a poll in which Museveni leads Besigye 53% to 28% (+/- 2.2%)[3]. And the reports of bribery and intimidation on the part of Museveni's supporters continue to pour in[4]. Bad news for democracy and Uganda, but good news for Museveni. The most recent arrest of Besigye[5] is not surprising, really, and further suggests that Museveni can do more-or-less as he likes without fearing backlash at the ballot box.

And he _is_ bothering. So he isn't going to rig the election.  It's a nice thought, but I'm not convinced. As I'm sure Museveni knows, there are limits to his power. There is an upper bound on how much he can tamper with the election, and he has appearances to keep up.

Uganda Elections: Museveni, Besigye and Mbabazi Prepare to Face Off in Polls http://www.newsweek.com/uganda-elections-museveni-besigye-and-mbabazi-prepare-face-polls-414541 By Conor Gaffey On 1/12/16 at 12:04 P Museveni\u2019s campaign has been built on the dual prongs of highlighting the successes of NRM governance while dismissing the credentials of his opponents, according to Phil Clark, an expert in African politics at SOAS University of London. Uganda has experienced a period of sustained economic growth under Museveni, averaging 7 percent GDP growth per year in the 1990s and 2000s, although this slowed to around 5 percent between 2000 and 2010. The country met its Millennium Development Goal of halving poverty by 2015, while also reducing hunger and improving equality in Uganda. \u201cPredictably, Museveni is going with a mandate of no change and continuity and trying to point to the various virtues of NRM governance over the last 30 years,\u201d says Clark. The ruling party has, however, come in for criticism for the heavy-handed tactics used by authorities in cracking down on opposition parties. Amnesty International released a report in December claiming that Ugandan police have tortured opposition activists, while a January report by Human Rights Watch claimed that journalists were being intimidated by government authorities if they expressed support for the opposition. Poll Gives Museveni Sizable Edge in Ugandan Presidential Race http://www.voanews.com/content/poll-gives-museveni-sizable-edge-in-ugandan-presidential-race/3155550.html Peter Clottey January 20, 2016 7:21 PM A new poll shows incumbent Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni of the ruling National Resistance Movement likely to win the February 18 presidential election with 51 percent of the vote. Kizza Besigye of the main opposition Forum for Democratic Change came in second with 32 percent, while independent candidate Patrick Amama Mbabazi, a former prime minister, was third with 12 percent. The Research World International poll, conducted January 15-19, surveyed 2,685 prospective voters in 89 districts across Uganda. Patrick Wakida, Research World's chief executive officer, said the poll was a true reflection of the support for candidates ahead of presidential, parliamentary and local elections. \u201cThis poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 5 [percentage points], which is attributed to a number of factors. There is quite a lot of fear among the voters and suspicion,\u201d Wakida said. \u201cSelection of respondents remains random and distribution of samples to different sub-regions was proportional to the population,\" he said, adding that most of those interviewed were illiterate or semiliterate, \"because that is the structure of our population.\" Challenger Besigye has launched a \u201cdefiance\u201d campaign as part of an effort to put pressure on Museveni ahead of the election. Supporters said the defiance campaign would help the opposition defeat the ruling party in both presidential and parliamentary elections. Wakida said the defiance campaign appeared to be working. When poll respondents were asked whether they wanted Museveni to stay or go, 46 percent said they were in favor of change in the upcoming elections while 49 percent said Museveni should be retained as president. Publicity stunt Opposition supporters rejected the polling results, saying the survey was a publicity stunt orchestrated and funded by the government because of the backlash Museveni got after skipping last week\u2019s presidential debate. They said the survey was yet another attempt to portray Museveni as popular despite what they said was his failed leadership that has led to the prevailing poor economic conditions. \u201cIf I were his handlers, never would I have allowed him to go for the presidential debate because he would have been the focus of the debate,\" Wakida said. \"He is the incumbent who has been in government for the last 30 years, so probably ... he feared to be made the subject of discussions. ... He would have made no significant increase in his supporters\" had he participated. \u201cI have never met that guy [Museveni]. We have never been at the same place, so my conclusion is I don\u2019t know him. And anybody who says [he funded us] loses the point.\u201d Wakida also said organizers of the debate missed a majority of the population because the debate was conducted in English instead of one of the local languages. \u201cPeople who have completed university education in this country are not more than 14 percent of the population,\" Wakida said."], [1547, "2016-01-29T03:52:30Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [15425, "2016-01-29T03:20:48Z", [0.96, 0.03, 0.01, 0.0], "want to remain above consensus on this"], [14920, "2016-01-28T22:58:11Z", [0.8, 0.1, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [2, "2016-01-28T22:17:00Z", [0.9, 0.05, 0.04, 0.01], "Moving up per @UnderwaterPutin."], [20, "2016-01-28T22:04:14Z", [0.99, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0], "The votes were counted 30 years ago."], [2, "2016-01-28T21:45:40Z", [0.85, 0.08, 0.05, 0.02], "Looks like Museveni is the incumbent, facing an independent challenger Mbabazi from his own party.

Small advantage to both Museveni and Mbabazi over the other candidates on these considerations.  I keep trying to remind myself that if Museveni can't get at least 50% of the vote, then there will be a runoff between him and the other top vote getter. One poll*** suggests that a united opposition to Museveni has a real chance of unseating him. (The poll is described as +/- 5%, and there are many independent reasons to think that voters are being circumspect with pollsters. Moreover, a rival polls has Museveni getting 71% of the vote. So get out the salt shaker.) Anyway, I expect Museveni to pull out all of the stops to get elected in the first round. If he doesn't win the election outright, then his chances drop significantly.  # http://ntv.co.ug/news/politics/25/jan/2016/mbabazi-says-nrm-has-plans-rig-2016-election-10908\n* http://sfbayview.com/2016/01/uganda-upcoming-elections-and-ongoing-us-influence-an-interview-with-milton-allimadi/\n** http://allafrica.com/stories/201601252149.html\n*** http://www.independent.co.ug/cover-story/10927-poll-battles-erupt"], [16851, "2016-01-25T21:58:07Z", [0.95, 0.02, 0.01, 0.02], ""], [368, "2016-01-25T20:24:32Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [16830, "2016-01-25T19:21:58Z", [0.11, 0.33, 0.06, 0.5], "Fraud lead to repeat elections"], [876, "2016-01-25T17:48:15Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [13652, "2016-01-25T15:24:00Z", [0.9, 0.05, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [16785, "2016-01-25T15:11:50Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [15844, "2016-01-25T14:52:42Z", [0.96, 0.02, 0.02, 0.0], ""], [691, "2016-01-25T13:24:22Z", [0.99, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [16694, "2016-01-25T11:24:14Z", [0.88, 0.05, 0.02, 0.05], ""], [11080, "2016-01-25T08:32:20Z", [0.97, 0.01, 0.02, 0.0], ""], [15880, "2016-01-25T04:30:19Z", [0.85, 0.1, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [4273, "2016-01-25T04:03:43Z", [0.94, 0.03, 0.02, 0.01], ""], [14487, "2016-01-25T03:18:59Z", [0.97, 0.02, 0.01, 0.0], ""], [14432, "2016-01-25T03:12:26Z", [0.95, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [5078, "2016-01-25T00:50:38Z", [0.98, 0.0, 0.02, 0.0], "Like Sibinsky(?)

However, note that _if_ the opposition vote were united behind a single candidate, Museveni would be in real trouble. Realization of this fact _might_ motivate some supporters of Mbabazi et al. to realign behind Besigye. The possibility of a tight election also might help bring some voters to the polls who would otherwise have stayed at home. That fact could favor the opposition as well, as younger voters might sense the first chance to make a major political change in their lifetimes. Note also that Museveni finished more than 40 percentage points ahead of Besigye** in the 2011 presidential election, but according to this poll Besigye is less 20 points behind Museveni. That's a pretty substantial drop in popularity. Indeed, the polling since July have seen huge gains for Besigye and tangible losses for Museveni***. Is this poll any good? Mbabazi for one, has been dismissive of the results of the poll, though one would expect him to do so since he comes out as a distant third in the race. It's also worth noting that the poll only adds up to 97%. So some data was not included (rounding perhaps?). The missing 3% could make a difference if the stars align.  The upshot: Besigye's odds go up slightly at the expense of Mbabazi and NOTA. Some thing to keep an eye on but which aren't yet worth any changes to my forecast: an attempt to disqualify Besigye as a candidate****. --- * http://kfm.co.ug/news/opinion-polls-a-false-reflection-of-society-views-mbabazi.html\n** I get it; the election results were far from free of problems.

As Amnesty International reports (alarmingly for friends of democracy), Museveni seems to be on the road to doing that effectively.*** One thing to watch for: Museveni crack downs go so far that they generate a large backlash.

The next thing I did, was to look at some data from a variety of sources. I decided to approach the situation by comparing the data between now and the last Ugandan elections, in the hope that this would give me a bit of an objective comparison, however this was quite difficult in many cases. The most interesting data that I found was: Transparency International has rated Uganda's public sector as one of the most corrupt in the world. In 2014, Uganda ranked 142nd worst out of 175 and had a score of 26 on a scale from 0 (perceived as most corrupt) to 100 (perceived as clean). GDP per capita has increased from 2.6% in 2012 to 4.8% in 2014. 2/3 of the work force work in agriculture. The main export is coffee. Oil has been found but will only start being produced locally in 2017: http://www.reuters.com/article/uganda-oil-idUSL6N0NV4AW20140509. Import partners: Kenya 18.3%, UAE 14.3%, India 12.8%, China 11.3%, Japan 4.4% (2014). Export Partners: Rwanda 10.1%, UAE 9.8%, Democratic Republic of the Congo 9.3%, Kenya 9.1%, Netherlands 6%, Germany 5.7%, Italy 5.5%, China 5.3% (2014). Uganda has soldiers deployed in the northern and eastern areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in the Central African Republic, Somalia, and South Sudan. The number of internally displaced persons is estimated at 1.4 million. Population of ca 37 million\nEthnic Groups: 17.4% Baganda, 9.8% Banyankole, 8.4% Basoga, 7.0% Bakiga, 6.1% Iteso, 3.2% Langi, 4.8% Acholi, 4.1% Bagisu, 4.14% Lugbara, 33.3% others. \nThe next research I did was on the incumbent, Yoweri Museveni, the strongman of Uganda. He has been in power since 1986. Despite the fact that he is a tough leader, with a questionable human rights record, he has massively boosted the Ugandan economy and defeated most of the rebels within his country. He has good control over the military: his son leads the special forces, a great deal of the military has been trained by US forces (at least those that have been deployed to Somalia) and most political, military and judiciary leaders are affiliated with him in some way. Museveni also controls the supreme court. Although the judges are elected by parliament, the supreme court judges are all chosen by Museveni. This has a great deal of importance because it is the supreme court that decides whether an election is invalidated or not (http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4882594.stm). It should be noted that election fraud is quite common, and the supreme court has ruled in almost every election year in the past that there have been irregularities, however they have not annulled any of the election results, as they have stated that the fraud did not significantly affect the outcome of the elections (http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-02-20/museveni-extends-25-year-rule-in-uganda-election-opponents-reject-result). Since taking over Uganda Museveni has massively improved the quality of life of the majority of his people (excluding some minorities and political opponents). To summarize: Museveni has control of a well trained Army, regularly participates in rigging elections (and is quite good at it), intimidates oponents (http://allafrica.com/stories/201512161117.html, http://www.geeskaafrika.com/uganda-violence-looms-large-in-campaigns/13978/) and seems to be genuinely quite popular (http://www.elections.co.ug/static/afro-barometer-poll). Most importantly, the majority of people in Uganda don\u2019t really have that much of an incentive to not vote for Museveni - he has literally pulled his country out of the ashes. \nThis leads me to ask the question: what could happen that would cause the incumbent to lose the election? I think there are three ways that he could lose the election. The first, is that more people simply vote for one of the contenders. The second option, is that there is some kind of armed revolution that would lead to Museveni being toppled AND the elections still taking place. Finally, I think a likely possibility is that Museveni dies before the election.\nFor one of the other candidates to be elected, it would have to mean that they have widespread support among the people that is so high, that it overcomes any election rigging, while not being so high that Museveni cancels the election. Currently, I do not think that any of the alternative candidates have the popular support required to have a significant enough impact to achieve this. Added to this, with such an ethnically divided country it would be very difficult to get widespread support in such a short time. If a candidate had this support, I think it would already be more clearly reflected in the polls and in the media. I think it is possible that another candidate may be able to mobilise the younger generations of ugandans (who now can register to vote online http://pctechmag.com/2015/08/uganda-electoral-commission-introduces-online-voter-verification-ahead-of-2016-polls/). However, I have not found any evidence that any of the candidates has an especially large or relevant grassroots movement amongst young Ugandans (and all of the front runners are part of the \u201cold\u201d establishment, so probably not particularly motivating to young ugandans). On the other hand, the Ugandan Electoral system is a two round system, so if Museveni gets less than 50% of the vote, he will run off against the second place candidate. This means that in theory, all voters could go against Museveni, giving the other candidate the majority of the vote. I doubt this will happen, on the one hand, because Museveni would ensure that the elections are rigged in his favour, on the other, because the incumbent would make sure to trade favours for support in a run off, and finally, I do not think Museveni will get less than 50%, based on the polls and his past support. His largest contender is Kizza Besigye, who has already lost several times in a row. The current polls do not seem to indicate that this will change. Besigye threatened violence and revolution after his last loss, however even his own party and affiliated MPs did not support him, which pushes my theory that the general sentiment of the people and politicians in Uganda is to keep making the most of the rather good status quo. The new runner in the race is Amama Mbabazi, former Prime Minister and confidant of Museveni. I think that Mbabazis chances are even lower. He does not even breach the 5% mark in the polls, and is running as an independent with no loyal party base to push him forward. Additionally, he just disbanded a large part of his electiont team: http://allafrica.com/stories/201512161307.html\n\tThe second reason he could lose the election, is if there is some kind of armed revolt, but the elections still take place. I think that this is very unlikely. I\u2019m a big fan of the greed vs. grievance model put forward by Paul Collier and Anke Hoeffler. Museveni has managed to ensure that fighting against the status quo has a very high opportunity cost. Obviously, there is the possibility that some oppressed minority or the large population of IDPs pick up arms and start a revolution. However, even if this did occur, I think it may even help Museveni, as it would give him an opportunity to show strength. Also, the timeframe and probability of a revolt taking place, for Museveni to be overthrown and the elections to still take place, is quite unrealistic in my opinion. Finally, Museveni has good relations with many of his neighbours, with the African Union, with the US and Russia (although he also has bad relations with other neighbours). I cannot identify any external players who is proactively pushing for a revolution or for Museveni to lose the election.\n\tThe final reason he may lose the election, is if he dies. I think an assassination attempt is not unlikely, especially by one of his enemies (Besigye has threatened violence on numerous occasions). However, the presidential guard is extremely loyal, lead by his son and very well trained. I think if Museveni has survived the last 30 years of leadership (and, as a quick google search shows, several assassination attempts), he will be able to survive until the election. Additionally, I am sure that there will be increased security in the run up to the election. On the other hand Museveni has done publicity stunts in the past where he is extremely exposed, such as driving himself to polling stations. The other reason he may die, is simply because he is an old man. I have not found much about his health status, but at over 70 years old he is already above the average Ugandan life expectancy (not unusual, as he probably has above average doctors and access to medical care). Nonetheless, it isn't a risk that can be ignored. However, if he does die by assassination or old age, I do not think that Mbabazi or Besigye would win. Instead I think that Musevenis son, who is allegedly being groomed to take his place (http://www.reuters.com/article/us-uganda-politics-idUSBRE94J0F420130520?feedType=RSS&feedName=worldNews) will take his father's place on the ballot. For this to happen, Museveni would have to die soon, the election committee (I assume also controlled by Museveni's family) and Supreme Court (controlled by Museveni) would have to allow Museveni's son to take his father's place on the ballot. It is also possible, that Museveni dies, and Mbabazi comes back into the fold and takes Museveni's place as the head of the NRM, and then takes his votes. All of these events are quite unlikely, although not completely impossible. I think it is a higher possibility that in the event of Museveni's death there is a coup, the army takes control, or some type of internal power struggle occurs, causing the elections to be postponed or delayed. So to summarize: * Museveni has been good for Uganda's economy. The economy is currently doing well. The opportunity cost of changing the status quo is high.\n* Museveni controls the military.\n* Museveni is experienced and successful in manipulating elections.\n* Museveni controls the supreme court, who decide if elections are fraudulent and their results annulled.\n* The most popular opponent, Besigye, has already lost 3 times in a row, and did not have the popular support to challenge the results of the last elections significantly. Even when Uganda was not doing as well economically as it is now, Besigye did not win.\n* The second most popular opponent, Mbabazi, has no party behind him and is polling very low.\n* Polls indicate that Museveni is significantly in the lead.\n* There appear to be no obvious external parties who have a significant interest in having Museveni lose the election.\n* Museveni may die before the election, in which case I believe his son would win.\n* Uganda has many ethnicities that are difficult to unite.\n* There appears to be no significant or unusual youth driven movement to support a specific candidate.\n* The elections are taking place in around 6 weeks. Based on this information, I think there is a 94% chance that Museveni will win. I think there is a 2% chance that Besigye will win, if he somehow manages to start a conflict, mobilise the youth (I believe Besigye is just the most likely to trigger an unlikely event at the last minute because of his experience and reputation) etc. I think there is a 2% chance that Mbabazi will win (same reasons as for Besigye, but with less faith in his ability to trigger an unlikely event and more faith that he may take Museveni's spot if Museveni dies). There is a 2% chance that Museveni dies, the elections take place, and his son wins the elections.\n\tUnfortunately, I think it is very likely that there will be violence, and people will die, after the elections. However, I do not think that the situation will spill over into widespread rebellion of any kind. I predict more street fights and riots, condemnation of the crooked elections, but ultimately it will be a return to the status quo. Unfortunately this will continue to mean rampant corruption for the time being, however, I think as the country continues to open up through the internet and access to mobile devices, there will be a significant backlash against corruption, oppression, the old guard, the lack of press freedom and the lack of representation of some minorities, within the next few years.\n"], [14501, "2016-01-03T13:35:24Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2016-01-03T13:07:49Z", [0.99, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [11080, "2016-01-03T13:06:52Z", [0.91, 0.02, 0.07, 0.0], ""], [11080, "2016-01-03T13:05:36Z", [0.93, 0.02, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [14501, "2016-01-03T12:37:20Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [14360, "2016-01-03T12:11:10Z", [0.87, 0.11, 0.01, 0.01], "Museveni is incumbent president (30 years) and change happens slowly in Africa.
