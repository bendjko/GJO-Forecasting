In the second quarter, real GDP increased 4.2 percent. The GDP estimate released today is based on more complete source data than were available for the \"second\" estimate issued last month. In the second estimate, the increase in real GDP was 3.5 percent. With this third estimate for the third quarter, personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and exports were revised down, and private inventory investment was revised up; the general picture of economic growth remains the same (see \"Updates to GDP\" on page 2). Real gross domestic income (GDI) increased 4.3 percent in the third quarter, compared with an increase of 0.9 percent in the second quarter. The average of real GDP and real GDI, a supplemental measure of U.S. economic activity that equally weights GDP and GDI, increased 3.8 percent in the third quarter, compared with an increase of 2.5 percent in the second quarter (table 1). The increase in real GDP in the third quarter reflected positive contributions from PCE, private inventory investment, nonresidential fixed investment, federal government spending, and state and local government spending that were partly offset by negative contributions from exports and residential fixed investment.

The GDP trend is downward but as of now still mostly pointing to positive current conditions. However, we're just seeing data from mid Q2 at this point. 3.2% GDP growth in Q1; ~1-1.5% in Q2. <0% in Q3 is not out of the question. Bottom line: the trend is close enough that I need to consider whether some external factor (like tariffs on Mexican goods, major natural disaster big enough to move GDP, some new geopolitical instability, etc) push the trend lower sharply in time to cause Q2 to be negative. So let's think about that: It would need to be before the 1st half of September (for a really huge event):\n1) 5%: I think the tariffs are the biggest threat that could cause Q3 to be negative: => i think this is mostly already appearing in the numbers, but we need to factor in the effect of the threat of Mexican tariffs. Even if they don't go into effect, there is the \n      Exports + imports = ~27% of GDP. Let's assume they slowed down aggregate import/export volume by the equivalent of 1 day (longer delays at border, economic costs). ~1.1% impact on GDP. That's enough to push us into recession in Q3 (and what we're observing now). SO the question is whether the administration will continue on this course in the face of evidence that it is putting the economy at risk. I don't think they would do this intentionally, but I could see miscalculations leading to this outcome especially associated with some unexpected external trigger. =>30% \n2) 1%: A related factor is slowing immigration into the US. probably not sudden or significant enough to move the trend much between now and Q3. Offset by increasing government deficit spending.\n3) 2%: major natural disaster. Hurricane season is expected to be near average. Big Earthquakes are on the order of 1% / year. Major forest fire: hard to envision that hitting GDP because they don't occur in big cities. Floods: same thing. \n4) 1% Major external issue, like bombing or other factor. Finally: what if Q3 is negative. We still need Q4 to be negative. -2%: I think if the administration fears recession they will pump fiscal stimulus into the economy.

At a more macro level, the Conference Board projects an annual real GDP growth of 2.7% and the NY Fed NowCast projects 2.2%.  Other Fed NowCasts are a bit less sanguine, but no one is projecting negative real GDP. There are a lot of jitters about a trade war with China, but this President knows full well that \"it's the economy, stupid,\" and although he's unpredictable on many levels, I think it's pretty predictable that he won't seriously jeopardize what he considers one of his signature re-election issues at this point. Real GDP would have to start going negative in 38 days, and stay negative for the next six months, in order for there to be two consecutive quarters of negative real GDP.  All things considered, that seems extremely unlikely.

The United States economy surged unexpectedly in the first quarter, the Commerce Department said Friday, allaying concern that financial-market volatility and a prolonged government shutdown would cause a slump. That is good news for President Trump, who is counting on a strong economy to improve his chances for re-election. With investors and consumers alike showing renewed optimism, it is now all but certain that the decade-long expansion will become the longest on record later this year. \u201cThe angst has settled, and the economy has come back,\u201d said Ben Herzon, an economist with Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting firm. \u201cI just can\u2019t point to anything now that\u2019s going to push us into recession.\u201d Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of goods and services produced in the economy, rose at a 3.2 percent annual rate in the first three months of the year.

The onset of a U.S. recession could take longer than usually thought after key points of the Treasury yield curve invert, as a surge in U.S. short-dated debt issuance has altered the dynamics of the Treasury market and other indicators show an economic downturn is farther off. As the Trump administration ramps up debt sales to cover a budget deficit projected to hit $1 trillion next year, it has crowded the front of the yield curve with far more new bonds than the back end. Banks, meanwhile, have shown a preference for mortgage-backed bonds over Treasuries since the financial crisis, a shift that has elevated the significance of moves in the yield curve of those bonds. These structural changes in supply and demand have some analysts thinking that means a longer lag until recession begins following any inversion of yields on two- and 10-year Treasuries, which has historically taken 18 months to two years. Some analysts and economists say that other yield curves may be better predictors of an impending economic downturn, and those are further away from flashing a warning signal than the two-year, 10-year Treasury spread.\n. . . \nAnalysts say that central banks\u2019 quantitative easing programs since the financial crisis of 2007-2009 have distorted the yield curve, meaning that an inversion of two-year and 10-year notes, if it occurs, should not be read that a recession is necessarily near. \u201cThe current curve is massively distorted by QE and also the effects of the unwind,\u201d said Thomas Simons, a money market economist at Jefferies in New York. The U.S. Treasury Department has increased supply of two-year notes by $82 billion since February, far exceeding $22 billion in 10-year notes it issued over the same time frame. \u201cThat\u2019s a very significant amount of supply that\u2019s been dumped into the front-end that hasn\u2019t been equally distributed into the long-end,\u201d said Simons. This has helped send yields on shorter-dated debt relatively higher, and compressed the spread between two-year and 10-year notes. Demand for Treasuries since the crisis has also changed, with banks increasingly turning to debt guaranteed by mortgage giants Fannie Mae (FNMA.PK) and Freddie Mac (FMCC.PK) as an alternative. \u201cGiven that banks are using it less than Fannie and Freddie, the importance of the Treasury curve has really diminished in the last nine-and-a-half years,\u201d said Brian Reynolds, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity. Fannie and Freddie bonds offer a higher yield pickup than Treasuries, and their bailout by the U.S. government in 2008 gave them a government guarantee. U.S. banks have increased their holdings of mortgage-backed debt guaranteed by Fannie, Freddie and other government agencies to $2.23 trillion, from $1.16 trillion at the end of 2008, while Treasury holdings have increased to $503 billion from $56 billion during the same period, according to data by the Federal Reserve. The gap between two-year and 10-year Fannie and Freddie yields is currently around 24 basis points and 44 basis points, respectively, making any future inversion likely to come later than that of the Treasury curve. An economic paper by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco in August, meanwhile, found that while the two-year, 10-year curve is typically the focus of financial commentators, the inversion between three-month bills and 10-year notes has better accuracy as a predictor of a recession 12 months into the future. That spread is also currently around 50 basis points, indicating that an inversion would occur later than that of the most commonly cited two-year, 10-year spread. \u201cIt could be many months before we see that point of the curve invert,\u201d said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist at Allianz Investment Management.\n"], [72396, "2019-04-23T03:29:36Z", [0.05], "Lowering from 10%.

Analysts say Europe\u2019s yield curve is also signaling economic weakness even as it holds at much steeper levels than the United States, reinforcing the notion that risks of a slowdown on both sides of the Atlantic are growing. The Federal Reserve\u2019s sudden pivot toward a dovish stance on future rate increases in March stunned the market and prompted a rapid repricing of Treasuries that in less than a week led to an inversion of the 3-month and 10-year Treasury curve. The inversion, where 3-month bills return at a higher rate than the longer-dated notes, is an anomaly that in the past has preceded economic downturns by around one to two years.

First, as @cafebedouin and others have pointed out, this has generally been a long lead indicator.  I think the average lead time between previous inversions and recessions is on the order of a year.  So even if this inversion foretells a recession, based on historic patterns it's still a way off. Second, this inversion was just a blip.  Five days.  I'm pretty sure this has happened before without a follow-on recession. Third, if you read various discussions about the inversion, there are some things that make it a bit different from previous inversions.  I'm not enough of a bond expert to explain it in depth, but a significant portion of this inversion seems to be related to mortgage refinancing (as opposed to a flight to safety).  And one potential side effect of all the refinancing is more consumer money in the everyday economy. Within that context, I think the economy still has some wind in its sails, and even though it might be slowing down there's nothing I see that's screaming \"Recession\" in the next two quarters. And as a final note, even though I think any President gets somewhat exaggerated blame and credit for the economy on their watch, this particular President seems to be more acutely sensitive to it.  I believe he's promised 3% growth, and despite the fact that most credible analysts think that's out of reach, I think that he will do anything imaginable keep it going.

To me, this sounds like hedging.   I suspect he has already received reports indicating and economic slowdown from the Federal Reserve and other government sources and is trying to shift the blame.   It is highly unlikely that the House, dominated by Democrats, will pass Trump's economic plan.   The issue is timing.   The business cycle always turns down eventually, and the yield curve always goes negative prior.  However, a recession does not always follow a negative yield curve.   I saw a chart of the yield curve and recessions going back more than 50 years.   The lag between the inversion of the yield curve and the recession seems to depend upon how inverted the curve becomes.  A lag of one to two years seems to be the most common lag period.   Right now, the yield curve is only slightly negative  (.02 percent), and it just happened.   I think a recession is likely, but not this year.  The price of oil has also had a significant affect on the economy when oil prices rise or fall quickly.  For example, the economy improved quickly after the sudden collapse in prices in 1983, 1996, and 2001, and did worse after price rises from 1969 to 1983, 1989, and 2007.   The price of oil has been rising and may rise a lot more.  If the price of oil hits $90  a barrel in the next few months, we will have a recession. If not, we might have a recession.

Second-quarter growth should rebound strongly, and growth should average at least 2.5% for the entire year. Growth was a decent 2.6% in the fourth quarter of 2018, following strong growth in the second and third quarters. Consumer spending grew 2.8% in the fourth quarter and will likely grow about the same in 2019. Income growth should still be strong because of low unemployment and lots of folks working. Government spending and housing construction will contribute modestly to growth, and businesses are adding to inventories. However, business investment is slowing markedly because of the uncertain outlook. Trade is likely to detract from growth, as slowing growth in overseas economies hurts exports. The added uncertainty of the U.S.-China trade war could create knock-on effects that slow business investment plans, and the need to rejig supply chains will reduce productivity and increase costs.

Still this figure is well above the US economy\u2019s long-term two-percent trend. During 2019, expect growth to slow further, as effects from fiscal stimulus measures wane, but to remain above its trend through the end of the year. Consumer spending is buoyed by a tight labor market which is driving more rapid wage gains. Businesses face a shrinking pool of available workers that could slow growth further during the year unless past investments have raised labor productivity, which recent data provide modest signals to support. A shift in Federal Reserve policy towards looser monetary policy should keep business confidence and investment sufficiently solid throughout 2019. Much depends on inflation though. If prices rise more rapidly than anticipated, the Federal Reserve may still raise interest rates later in 2019 to prevent the economy from overheating. This may become a greater risk if businesses pass rising labor costs onto their customers. From a global perspective, 2019 sets up as a more challenging year for business than 2018. Growth in the Euro Area and China is slowing which will constrain opportunities for exports. A more favorable domestic monetary policy environment can keep growth above two percent into 2020 but cannot release the US economy from limits imposed by slow demographic growth. More promising is a rise in productivity growth during 2018. Spending on software and research and development accelerated rapidly last year and seems to have helped fuel productivity growth. Should this trend continue in 2019, businesses will have a chance to deploy new technologies and increase the efficiency of their workers. This represents the clearest path for keeping revenue and profit growth robust in 2019 and beyond. \nThe Conference Board Website. (2019). The Conference Board Economic Forecast for the U.S. Economy.

Aside from the FOMC's January minutes, last week did not contain too much forecasting information.  This week, on the other hand, is chocked full of it.  So I was inclined to just sit it out to see what shakes, but I came across a podcast that had an interesting view that I wanted to share. The podcast is an interview with a guy named Adam Robinson.  He seems to be a polymath of sorts, with a very interesting string of accomplishments.  I won't bore you with them because he's easy enough to Google.  Also, you can listen to Part I: https://fs.blog/adam-robinson-pt1/ Anyway, Adam has a hierarchy for who in the financial world really has their finger of the pulse. At the top of the heap are the metals traders, followed by the bond traders.  At the very bottom are the central bankers, and just above them economists in general.  In the middle are equities traders and currency traders. In the world of metal trading, he swore that the ratio of price-for-copper over price-for-gold has historically been the most accurate predictor of what's ahead for the economy.  When things are good, there is a demand for copper (electronics, etc.), and the price goes up.  On the other hand, when things are good the price of gold goes down.  So a very high ratio is a signal that things are good, and a climbing ratio is a signal that things are getting better.  At least as metal traders see it. On the other hand, when things are slowing down the demand for copper goes down, and the demand for gold does up.  So the ratio starts dropping. You can see some historical ratios here: http://www.infomine.com/investment/price-ratios/copper-gold/ As you can see, the ratio for the past year or so has been relatively flat.  It hit bottom in the summer 2016...shot back up...and has been dancing around 0.15 - 0.16 ever since.   To the extent that this is, indeed, a good signal, I take it to mean that the metal traders view things as relatively stable.   But is it a good signal? Given how strongly Adam Robinson gushed about it in the podcast, I would have expected there to be tons of web sites and blogs referring to it.   There are some, for sure, but it doesn't appear to carry the same weight was bond ratios. To me, though, it is another little signal.  And as far as that goes, it's seems to be signalling either stability or uncertainty.

I was wondering how I was going to capture it all in an informative yet readable post.  Then the Wall Street Journal came to the rescue on Saturday with a story: \u201cSmattering of Contradictory Data Confounds Economists.\u201d   The story opened with, \u201cEconomic data are usually noisy, but this week included an onslaught of negative and often contradictory signals that made even seasoned economists scratch their heads.\u201d For example, it went on to say, \u201cA Federal Reserve report on Friday showed U.S. industrial production dropped sharply in January , even though other data have suggested the manufacturing sector remains strong. Then the University of Michigan reported a February rebound in consumer sentiment, a day after the Commerce Department said consumer spending sank during the holiday shopping season. And so on. So I won\u2019t spend a lot of time fleshing out what the WSJ has summarized so well.  The point is, the data were confusing this past week.  I still think the chances of two consecutive quarters of negative real GDP growth are slim for two reasons: First, the jobs numbers and the jobs opening numbers \u2014 both of which have been published recently \u2014 are strong.  Very strong.  And consumer spending is the foundation of GDP growth. Second, I was looking at the chart that @pietrokc posted on 15 Feb.   https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/gdp-growth GDP growth in recent quarters has been relatively strong.  And if you look at the longer history, you can see that GDP often falls for 2 - 3 quarters without going into recession territory.   Does that mean it won\u2019t happen this time? Gottfried Liebniz once said, \u201cNature has established patterns originating in the return of events, but only for the most part.\u201d  That\u2019s one of my North Star decision tools; I try not to put too much stock into past patterns like this. But that doesn\u2019t mean I ignore them, either.  I do think it\u2019s worth noting that GDP growth goes up and down all the time.

I. Overview The slight preponderance of not-bad news starts with the IMF lowering its global economic growth forecast for this year from 3.7 per cent to 3.5 per cent.  I consider that good news because 3.5 percent growth is still fairly strong (and definitely positive).   II. Bond Market   To the extent that the bond market knows things before the stock market, and the yield curve is its way of transmitting that knowledge, the signals appear to be mixed. I was under the impression the 2-yr/10-yr curve was the bellweather, and that seems stable right now.  It started last week with a 0.18 spread, and ended with a 0.18 spread (possible good news). On the other hand, some time ago someone posted a link to a NY Fed site that forecasts the probability of a recession, and it seems the NY Fed uses the 3-mo/10-yr.  And that yield curve narrowed significantly last week, dropping from 0.30 to 0.20 last week (possible bad news). III. Fed The Fed \u2014 writ large \u2014 didn\u2019t say much last week that pertains to this forecast, but the NY Fed upped the probability of a recession during the next 12 months from 21% to 23.6% based on the 3-mo/10-yr spread.  That's not great news, but I don't think it's bad news, either. IV. GDP A. Consumer Spending   Unit vehicle sales for January were at a 16.6 million annualized rate vs 17.5 million in December. This is a slow start to first-quarter as far as consumer spending goes, but still pretty solid. B. Business Investments There was an article in the WSJ last Tuesday extolling the importance of Purchasing Managers Indexes (PMI) as a leading indicator.  Not coincidentally, that same day  Econoday reported that the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s (ISM) non-manufacturing sample showed good growth for January at 56.7. There was a lot of chatter on Econoday about various nuances if you parse the data, but the bottom line was \u201coverall rates of growth for both this sample and the services PMI sample remain healthy and favorable and consistent with solid and sustainable GDP growth.\u201d C. Government Spending Nothing of note on the government spending front. D. Net Exports These reports tend to lag pretty much in general, and the government slowdown didn\u2019t help.  But it seems there was a pullback in imports late last year that decreased the trade deficit a bit. The conventional wisdom seems to be that even though there is a general weakness in exports, fourth quarter GDP estimates may rise. V. Misc Earnings. The past two weeks have been earnings season, and apparently this is pretty closely watched.  Goldman Sachs reported, \u201c47% of firms have beaten consensus EPS estimates by at least 1 standard deviation [and while] the percentage of firms beating on the bottom line has moderated from 56% in 3Q, [it] remains in line with the long-term average\u2026EPS grew by 14% during 4Q, up from the 12% consensus forecast prior to the season [and] as a result of low investor expectations, firms beating on the bottom line have outperformed S&P 500 by 247 bp on the day after reporting earnings, the highest magnitude of outperformance since 3Q 2009.\u201d Although the first-order effects would seem to be tied to the stock market, if companies are doing well it can probably also be inferred they will carry on with business investments.

I. The Bond Market The 2s10s yield curve widened a bit last week.  It opened the week with a 0.16 spread, and closed the week with a 0.18 spread.  I did a few spot checks on other yield curves, and they widened, also.  To the extent that this is a long leading indicator of a recession, it appears the bond market does not think one is in the cards soon.   II. The Fed The Fed met and decided to leave the overnight lending rate unchanged, and there has been no end to various narratives around the meaning of this.  On the negative side, one can say the Fed sees dark clouds on the economic horizon (e.g., a possible economic slowing, or recession).  OK, but still, the Fed is doing what it\u2019s supposed to do in those cases: it\u2019s easing up on interest rate hikes to bolster the economy. And by easing up on interest rate hikes, it will make consumer spending and business investments (the two biggest components of GDP) easier, because personal and business borrowing will not get more expensive.   III. GDP Components A. Consumer Spending  1. Employment.  The big news here is the Employment Situation report, which came out on Friday.  304,000 net jobs added in January, which beat the consensus estimate of 158,000 by quite a bit.  As consumer spending is a huge part of GDP, this bodes well (at least for now).  2. Housing.  On the up side, New home sales jumped 16.9 percent in November to a 657,000 annualized rate, and construction spending rose a decent  0.8 percent in November .  On the down side, pending home sales on the resale market dropped 6.4 percent in December, which was the lowest in more than three years.   3. Consumer Sentiment.  This is down 7.1% from December.  Not so good, although it arguably just suffered from the government shutdown. 4. Personal Income and Outlays. This report has been delayed but personal income is seen rising 0.4 percent (very good) in December. At the same time, consumer spending is expected to increase 0.3 percent (moderate).  Six-month buying plans show a small uptick for autos, a large downtick for major appliances. B. Business Investments Both the PMI manufacturing index and the ISM manufacturing index were very good.  PMI came in at 54.9, which is just a bit over the previous 53.8.  ISM came in at 56.6, which is solidly over the previous 54.3.  Both of these reports are saying the same thing: there was solid growth in January. This is consistent with a Wall Street Journal article of 28 January in which railroad executives reported that customers are planning to ship more goods, and are also moving ahead with long-term capital projects, to include expanding facilities. C. Government Spending The government re-opened (at least temporarily) and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the government shutdown will nick 0.4% off the GDP, making it 2.1% growth.  Goldman Sachs estimates the same 0.4% nick, but believes the final figure for GDP growth will be 1.9%. D. Net Exports The International Trade in Goods Report was delayed, so it\u2019s hard to say anything about net exports.  But this only accounted for -5% of the GDP in 2017, so it\u2019s not really one of the long poles in the tent. IV. Conclusion. Again, there are a lot of mixed signals just now.  Some describe last week\u2019s data as indicating a Goldilocks economy.  Others see nothing but doom and gloom.  I am strongly inclined to think we\u2019ll make it though 2019 with no more than one negative quarter mainly because the 800 pound gorilla of the GDP (consumer spending) and its younger brother (business investments) are so positive just now."], [67129, "2019-02-04T14:58:45Z", [0.27], "In the history after 1950 the US economy expirienced 11 recession periods according to NBRE definition, but only in 9 of them real GDP fell in two consecutive quarters (and never GDP fell in two consecutive qurters without a NBER recession). 9 cases in approx. 7 decades is a quite low probability. However, the odds that 2019 will become a recession year are clearly higher as the recovery is already mature (the upswing started in Q3 2009), many indicators are already heading south and the trade war is a burden fore GDP growth, too. However, there is little evidence that a recession will start already in Q1. The odds are higher for a start in Q2, but still not really high and again somewhat higher for Q3. This means, that the odds for two consecutive negative quarters in 2019 decrease: If the recession just starts in Q4, it ois obvious that two negative quarters in 2019 are impossible. But even if it starts in Q2 or Q3: In two out of the nine periods the 4th and 5th recession quarter were the two first with two consequtive quarters of negrtive real GDP growth and only in seven of this cases that happend right from the start or in the second and third quarter of the recession.

The book is Masters of Nothing: How the Crash Will Happen Again Unless We Understand Human Nature by Matthew Hancock and Nadhim Zahawi (published in 2011 in the UK by Biteback Publishing and available on pre-order in the US). In 2004, the book explains, the deputy governor of the Bank of England (the UK central bank), Sir Andrew Large, gave a powerful and eloquent warning about the coming crash at the London School of Economics. The speech was published on the bank\u2019s website but it received no notice. There were no seminars called. No research was commissioned. No newspaper referred to the speech. Sir Andrew continued to make similar speeches and argue for another two years that the system was unsustainable. His speeches infuriated the then Chancellor, Gordon Brown, because they warned of the dangers of excessive borrowing. In January 2006, Sir Andrew gave up: he quietly retired before his term was up. In 2005, the chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, Raghuram Rajan, made a speech at Jackson Hole Wyoming in front of the world\u2019s most important bankers and financiers, including Alan Greenspan and Larry Summers. He argued that technical change, institutional moves and deregulation had made the financial system unstable. Incentives to make short-term profits were encouraging the taking of risks, which if they materialized would have catastrophic consequences. The speech did not go down well. Among the first to speak was Larry Summers who said the speech was \u201clargely misguided\u201d.\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2011/11/22/5086/#52570a99f92f\n"], [24146, "2019-02-04T02:49:42Z", [0.1], ""], [19340, "2019-02-04T01:29:57Z", [1.0], ""], [62319, "2019-02-03T21:22:29Z", [0.15], ""], [56, "2019-02-03T12:09:13Z", [0.1], ""], [63825, "2019-02-03T08:25:45Z", [0.07], ""], [61391, "2019-02-03T04:33:21Z", [0.0], ""], [67241, "2019-02-03T02:07:17Z", [0.3], ""], [1333, "2019-02-02T22:55:58Z", [0.15], ""], [67238, "2019-02-02T19:56:23Z", [0.65], "Momentum will carry GDP awhile, but trade mess, decreasing consumer demand, global market problems will lead to decreased GDP late in the period"], [19340, "2019-02-02T18:05:38Z", [1.0], ""], [691, "2019-02-02T15:14:21Z", [0.09], ""], [65001, "2019-02-02T03:01:10Z", [0.04], "Federal Open Market Committee on January 30 projects slower but still \"solid\" growth of US economy through 2019, with proviso to watch out for \"crosscurrents\" in China and Europe.

Although employment is humming (see below), inflation remains low for now.   So from a monetary policy point of view, it appears the rest of 2019 will support continued growth. Moving on\u2026 Looking at the components of GDP is a bit tricky since the government shutdown apparently precluded some data from being collected/reported, but there are some data points.  1. Consumer spending This is about 70% of GDP, and it\u2019s looking good. Jobless Claims: Although there was a rise in claims by (apparently) furloughed workers, initial jobless claims fell 13,000 and were at 199,000 last week. This is the lowest rate in about 50 years. Home Sales: It\u2019s true, home sales fell 6.4% in December, but mortgage rates were still coming down off November highs.   Mortgage rates peaked in November and have since declined about 40 basis points to roughly 4.75 percent for 30-year fixed mortgages.  Bank of America reported on 22 January that sentiment among home builders rose for the first time in three months.  The feeling is that there is a pent-up demand, and now that mortgage rates have declined the spring selling season will see the market rebound somewhat. Consumer spending is the 800 pound gorilla in the GDP, and it\u2019s looking pretty lively.  It would take a lot of downside in the other factors to counteract this. 2. Business Investments This is about 18% of GDP. On the one hand, Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE) reported on 24 January that foreign direct investments (FDI) have fallen significantly, and they made passing reference to domestic investments falling, also.    On the other hand, Market Watch reported on 22 January about a survey of Federal Reserve Senior Load officers, and said \u201ccredit conditions for both commercial and industrial firms remain accommodative, with the banking community willing to extend funding to corporate borrowers. While one could argue that easy credit has led to a record level of debt for non-financial corporations and could eventually pose a problem were the economy to slow noticeably, for now it portends future economic growth with credit conditions for commercial and industrial firms leading real GDP by about nine months. Based on where credit conditions are right now, we should see decent economic growth well into 2019.\u201d So I\u2019m around neutral in my thoughts about business investments. 3. Government Spending This is about 17% of GDP. Well, the shutdown is over for now.   In a rational world one might think that the President and his allies in the Congress would have learned a thing or two from this little standoff and would be hugely reluctant to try a repeat.  On the other hand\u2026it\u2019s not exactly a rational world just now, is it? That said, with 2020 right around the corner, and everyone realizing how much of a negative economic impact these shutdown sort of things have, I\u2019m inclined to believe that self-interest will prevail and the President will do everything possible to keep spending up. So as with business investments, I am more or less neutral here. 4. Net Exports This is about 5% of GDP (-5%, actually) On the one hand, the global trade front is looking dour.  China is having problems\u2026Europe is having problems\u2026and the IMF is making noise about a global economic slowdown.   But again, it only accounted for 5% of the GDP the last time those numbers were available, and a global economic slowdown would have to be pretty serious to make a significant dent in US GDP. Summary.  So all in all I am feeling pretty sanguine about it this week.  It is definitely easy to imagine a slowdown of US GDP, but two quarters of real negative growth seems a bit of a stretch right now. And on a final note, this will be an interesting week.  The GDP report is due out Wednesday morning, and an FOMC meeting report on is due out Wednesday afternoon (not to mention a few other key indicators later in the week, as well as earnings reports from some of the big guns)."], [6978, "2019-01-28T02:17:56Z", [0.14], ""], [1034, "2019-01-27T21:44:23Z", [0.0], ""], [13377, "2019-01-27T21:30:39Z", [0.27], ""], [67106, "2019-01-27T19:53:10Z", [0.12], "Outside of something itself not predictable happening, the economy will not enter recession.

There are a handful of the usual factors that are worth observing, but I think the precipitous decline in foreign direct investment in the United States over the past 2.5 to 3.5 years may be one of the more obvious factors. The Peterson Institute for Int'l Economics released a report indicating that FDI is only 35% of what it was in 1Q2016, and that the \"shift of corporate investment away from the United States will decrease long-term US income growth, reduce the number of well-paid jobs available, and accelerate the shift of global commerce away from the United States.\" [1] That's a steep decline whose effects I'm sure will bleed into the coming year, perhaps, and definitely into the year thereafter. Elsewhere, domestically, sales of existing homes fell 10.3% for the year (2018). [2] This is a trendline some experts say reflects waning consumer confidence. Sales fell by 6.4% in December 2018 alone. How does this factor into the U.S. economic situation? No real clue, but I'm curious as to how economists will seek to resolve any housing market troubles considering how they obliterated the safety net from the previous recession. Elsewhere-elsewhere, China's economic slowdown, however phrased, will no doubt impact the global economy. Trade stress with the U.S. is one thing, but when the world's second-largest economy shows reluctance, then there are broader implications, I think, moving forward.

Here's my shot: \n1) History suggests that when recessions do occur they are not widely anticipated by consensus GDP forecasts and only a small fraction (like less than 10%) of economists predict a recession in the October of the prior year, which is only 3x more than predict recessions when they don't occur! By April people have figured it out, on average. The general pattern is that GDP forecasts start out at around the long-term trend (call it ~3%) and decline to around zero by April. In October they were 2.7-3.0%. So, that means that if we are on track for a recession that consensus forecasts should be around 1.3-1.4% now. They're not, there around 2.4-2.5%. So that means consensus is dropping around 0.1% per month, which isn't on track for a recession, but still within say 1 sigma of the trend. So based on that data I would say we're looking at <30% of recession in 2019. \n2) We have not yet seen a full inversion of the yield curve, which has preceded every recent recession with a lead of roughly 12-18 months. It's possible that we will see a recession without a yield curve inversion. Call that 10%. It's possible that we will see a yield curve inversion and then have a short lag to recession which in this case would need to be < 6 months. i'll call that another 10%. => 20% total. \n3) LEI peaked in September, so the beginning of the 9-18 month window from then would be June 2019. (NOTE: This was hardly reported in the press. The revision to the October LEi was -0.4!). This seems like the strongest indication of recession. If that was indeed the peak, then it seems to indicate a probability of something like 40%. However, there is also a chance that LEI continues moving upward and sets a new peak and in that case we're unlikely to have 2 negative quarters in 2019. Call that probability 50%. => 20%. Ok, so based on all that I would average those three values for lack of a better methodology. => average(30%, 20%, 20%) = 23% Based on earlier calculations => average (30%, 20%, 20%) = 23% Best guess of GDP as things stand => ~1.5 consensus forecast in April. All that said, I think there are macro factors that aren't included in that (except indirectly through the yield curve and stock market component of the LEI). \n**-- Odds of messy Brexit have increased. could have a -4 to 5% impact on UK GDP. What would that do for US GDP? Some thoughts: 1) will hurt out trade with the UK. -0.1%, tops; 2) will increase the dollar and hurt our trade with other countries => possibly significant. \n-- China trade. First order impacts are probably reflected well in stock prices. Who knows about 2nd order. ?? \n**-- Shutdown longer and pain deepening. Already has cost the economy something like ~-0.1 - 0.3%. My best guess from what I've read is 0.1% of GDP per week, currently at 0.4% of GDP. My sense is that the damage is accelerating especially in terms of impact on consumer and business confidence. So my best guess is 0.7% +/-1.5%. So roughly 45% chance of recession.

There have been 7 episodes of two consecutive negative quarterly growth rates since 1950 [1].  What is the likelihood that this is coming in 2019? Recent volatility and corrections in the stock market leads to speculations that a recession is coming.  While many people believe that a stock market correction precedes a recession (as defined by the two consecutive negative growth rates), it is not necessarily the case.  For example, the dot com bust in 2001 was not associated with 2 consecutive negative growth rates [1].  In other words, a bear market does not necessarily result in two consecutive negative growth rates. The trade war intensified from mid-year 2018 and it could significantly affect the GDO growth.  However, the growth rates in the last two quarters in 2018 are 4.2% and 3.5%, respectively [1].   The larger number (4.2%) is probably affected by the stockpiling of goods prior to the trade war.  However, the second number (3.5%) probably reflects the actual effects of the trade war.  Some people argue that without the trade war, the GDP growth would have been much higher in that quarter [2].  If this argument holds, it means that the underlying growth rate in the U.S. is high enough to counterbalance the negative effect of the trade war.  China and the U.S. are negotiating on the trade issues.  While a positive outcome is not guaranteed, both countries realize that it is in its own interest to arrive in a settlement.  It is a question of coming up with a compromise to let Trump declared a \u201cwin\u201d and China to \u201csave face\u201d (declaring that it did not succumb to the U.S.).  The current negotiation deadline is the end of March.  While I am not convinced that the negotiations will be completed by that time, I don\u2019t see that they will drag on to result in a recession, or two quarterly negative growth.

I still think the probability of two consecutive quarters of negative real GDP growth is low, but I think it\u2019s a little more likely than my initial forecast indicated. It seems GDP is computed from the following four components (the percentages are from 2017, the last year for which I was able to get solid data): \t1. Personal consumption ( 70% )\n\t2. Business Investments  (18% )\n\t3. Government spending  (17% )\n\t4. Net exports ( -5% ) Taking each one separately: 1. Personal consumption On the one hand, employment figures have been very good.  There definitely appears to be more money there from consumers to spend. One the other hand, the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index shows that consumer confidence fell from 98.3 to 90.7.  Apparently economists had forecast the index to be 96.  So that\u2019s a little bit of bad news.   There has also been some chatter about an \u201cautomobile recession.\u201d   From what I can tell, this is essentially about the shift from sedans to SUVs, and a Bloomberg article from 13 January opines that this could result in about 20,000 job losses as plants close. So although I am generally positive about this sector of the GDP, I think there are a few potential clouds in the horizon. 2. Business Investments This is an area where the Fed can make a difference.  Business investments consist of fixed investments and changes in inventory.  Those fixed investments often come from borrowing, which is sensitive to interest rates. The Fed has indicated it is going to be flexible with future rate hikes.  Since inflation does not appear to be an issue, I suspect the Fed will go easy on rate hikes this year and try to maintain some forward momentum with respect to business investments. In any case, I have not found any indications that businesses are rethinking their investment plans to the point that it might have a serious impact on GDP, while at the same time it seems the Fed is \"listening.\" 3. Government spending Although this has everyone\u2019s attention right now, and it is having an effect of GDP, this is also an area where Donald Trump can have a lot of impact.  His advisors are apparently acknowledging that the shutdown is having a bigger negative economic effect than they had anticipated, and \u2014 coincidence? \u2014 Trump is now at least trying to appear to be making concessions in his dealings with the Democrats in Congress.   No matter what, at this point I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to seriously risk a recession over The Wall when 2020 is right around the corner. 4. Net exports   This is the toughest one of the four for me to formulate a coherent opinion about.  Notice that in 2017 net exports contributed -5% to the GDP.  I\u2019m not certain, but I believe this was from trade deficits. Our biggest trading partners are: \t\tCanada: US$282.5 billion (18.3% of total US exports)\n\t\tMexico: $243 billion (15.7%)\n\t\tChina: $130.4 billion (8.4%)\n\t\tJapan: $67.7 billion (4.4%)\n\t\tUnited Kingdom: $56.3 billion (3.6%)\n\t\tGermany: $53.5 billion (3.5%)\n\t\tSouth Korea: $48.3 billion (3.1%) Of those, we\u2019re having issues with Canada and Mexico in the form of whatever is replacing (or has replaced) NAFTA; we\u2019re having issues with China in the form of a simmering trade war (and China itself is having some internal economic issues); the UK seems to be possibly on the verge of a hard Brexit; and Germany is having some internal economic problems. How might these issues affect trade deficits this year, and consequently on the GDP?  Again, it\u2019s hard for me to gauge that, and until I can better get my head around this I\u2019ll stay neutral on it. So in general, I think the possibility of two consecutive quarters of negative real GDP growth is higher than it was, but I still think it\u2019s relatively low.

A US government bond yield curve inversion is generally considered a long leading indicator of a recession.  To me this is kind of a tricky proposition for several reasons. First, which yield curve?  If you survey all the web sites and such, you can find people using the 1 mo/30yr at one end, and people using the 2yr/5yr at the other end.  I am going to focus on the 2yr/10yr for two reasons: (1) a plurality of people and organizations seem to use it, and (2) the CFA question here last fall involved the 2yr/10yr, which leads me to infer it has some special significance. Second, the sample size.  As far as I can tell, there have only been 11 recessions since WWII.  There were apparently several recessions in the \u201850s and \u201860s that were not preceded by a yield curve inversion, and I have read that the curve inverted twice in the late-60s without follow-on recessions [1]. The real correlation appears to have started in the late-70s.  Since 1978 there have been five recessions, and each has been preceded by a yield curve inversion.  That\u2019s an incredibly small sample size from which to be making inferences.  Nonetheless, this seems to be something of a gold standard, so I am going to start there. Third, the data.  I cannot find a single authoritative source of all the data I would like: both the dates of 2yr/10yr yield curve inversions, and the dates that recessions start.  One would think the Fed would have it, but I could not find it.  So I\u2019ve had to cobble together a data set from different sources, and I\u2019m not 100% sure of its accuracy. That said, if I did gather and interpret the numbers correctly, since 1978 the times (in months) between a 2yr/10yr yield curve inversion and the beginning of a recession have been 17, 10, 19, 11, and 24.  The average lead time, then, has been 16.2 months, with the minimum lead time being 10 months.  (Note: that fourth lead time \u2014 11 months \u2014 is probably subject to debate, but I am going to be conservative and use it.) The current 2yr/10yr spread is 0.16.  Assuming something really dastardly happens and it goes down below zero over, say, the next several weeks, on average that would presage the beginning of a recession by 16.2 months.  This would be Q2 2020.  Even if we went with the minimum historic lead time, this would be Q4 2019. So I am inclined to think the probability of two consecutive quarters of negative GDP are pretty close to nil.  This is in line with several other forecasts that use yield curve inversion models.  That said, there are a few reasons why I am not saying 0% probability. The GDP is generally thought of as having four components: personal consumption expenditures, investments, net exports, and government expenditures. In looking at those four and the current administration, it\u2019s not hard to imagine the GDP taking some sort of hit due to decreased government expenditures and decreased net exports. Although the current government shutdown only affects a portion of the government, there is a debt ceiling issue coming up on 01 March.  Who knows what\u2019s going to happen at that point. On top of that, both Europe and China (trading partners) are experiencing economic headwinds, and Trump seems bent on having trade wars with some of our biggest trading partners.  It\u2019s possible exports could take a hit. And finally, there is one factor that makes this situation a bit different from previous situations, and that is the years of quantitative easing and the current quantitative tightening.  New territory here...maybe this is the recession that is not preceded by a yield curve inversion. So I am adding a few points to my forecast to account for these factors.

Here's my shot: \n1) History suggests that when recessions do occur they are not widely anticipated by consensus GDP forecasts and only a small fraction (like less than 10%) of economists predict a recession in the October of the prior year, which is only 3x more than predict recessions when they don't occur! By April people have figured it out, on average. The general pattern is that GDP forecasts start out at around the long-term trend (call it ~3%) and decline to around zero by April. In October they were 2.7-3.0%. So, that means that if we are on track for a recession that consensus forecasts should be around 1.3-1.4% now. They're not, there around 2.4-2.5%. So that means consensus is dropping around 0.1% per month, which isn't on track for a recession, but still within say 1 sigma of the trend. So based on that data I would say we're looking at <30% of recession in 2019. \n2) We have not yet seen a full inversion of the yield curve, which has preceded every recent recession with a lead of roughly 12-18 months. It's possible that we will see a recession without a yield curve inversion. Call that 10%. It's possible that we will see a yield curve inversion and then have a short lag to recession which in this case would need to be < 6 months. i'll call that another 10%. => 20% total.\n3) LEI peaked in September, so the beginning of the 9-18 month window from then would be June 2019. (NOTE: This was hardly reported in the press. The revision to the October LEi was -0.4!). This seems like the strongest indication of recession. If that was indeed the peak, then it seems to indicate a probability of something like 40%. However, there is also a chance that LEI continues moving upward and sets a new peak and in that case we're unlikely to have 2 negative quarters in 2019. Call that probability 50%. => 20%. Ok, so based on all that I would average those three values for lack of a better methodology. => average(30%, 20%, 20%) = 23% Best guess of GDP as things stand => ~1.5 consensus forecast in April. All that said, I think there are macro factors that aren't included in that (except indirectly through the yield curve and stock market component of the LEI). \n    -- messy Brexit could have a -4 to 5% impact on UK GDP. What would that do for US GDP? Some thoughts: 1) will hurt out trade with the UK. -0.1%, tops; 2) will increase the dollar and hurt our trade with other countries => possibly significant.\n    -- China trade. First order impacts are probably reflected well in stock prices. Who knows about 2nd order. ??\n    -- Shutdown. Already has cost the economy something like ~-0.1 - 0.3%. So my best guess is 0.8% +/-1.5%.  So roughly 40% chance of recession.

However, when comparing to previous recession, this is similar to Q2 2008 (first negative variance in GDP in Q4, 2008). So, it is possible to \"meet the question's target\" with these levels of GDP. 50/50.\nPrivate spending is a key factor in GDP growth. I use some indicators:\n- Unemployment level (at same levels as 2006/2007, it started to grow a year earlier than Q4, 2008, so adding to \"No\" (https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/unemployment-rate)\n- Consumer sentiment, still very high compared to 2007 when started to decline, another one for \"No\" (https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/consumer-confidence)\n- Household debt to GDP, also very low (76%) compared to previous years, \"No\" (https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/households-debt-to-gdp)\n- Business optimism index, stable for the last couple of years, \"No\" (https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/nfib-business-optimism-index)\nGovernment deficit in absolute and % of GDP terms, and Fed debt, both extremely high as result of tax cuts. This could be damaging GDP if the Federal Reserve continues with the monetary policy of rate increase, but this is not likely with inflation under control and if the US economy enters into a slowdown (https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/12/15/the-fed-needs-a-new-strategy-for-2019). It would be harder for the US to recover from a recession, but that is not the question here. With the Fed support, \"Yes\" goes down in 5 points.\nProductivity has decreased, but that is a long term effect, probably longer than the one-year frame for the question.\nIndicator: short-term vs 10-year bond yield spread is close to zero (apparently, negative difference indicates a recession). One for \"Yes\" +10 points\nTrigger event: I'm looking for an issue that could turn all indicators into negative, mainly through consumer confidence. I can think about a few:\n- Trade war with China, increased with challenges in China's growth. The only one I see that could have a short term impact. +4 points\n- Sillicon Valley vs EU war.\n- Trump's political difficulties.\n- KSA - Oil relationships.\nFinally, it seems to be an increase in mentions to \"Recession\" in media, which can change sentiment, but at medium term only +2 points\nTotal 17%.

I'd expect to see a slowdown relative to 2018, if not only because 2018 was a very strong year that it is hard to keep up with that. There are also obvious causes of uncertainty, and poorly planned and rolled out economic policies (tariffs). My personal opinion is that the concept of recession isn't sufficient for discussing poor economic conditions. If people are often using recession to describe activity that isn't \"two consecutive quarters\" of negative growth, then the vocabulary likely isn't good enough.

Below I use data to test these claims. I find that a) the duration of the current business cycle has no predictive power; and b) the treasury spread gives strong evidence that we are not going to see a recession soon. While the treasury spread doesn't rule out a recession soon, it does make me think it's less likely (hence I'm adjusting my forecast from 6% to 4%). (In future updates I'll address the trade war, low unemployment, and the stock market.)     \u2022 Duration of the current business cycle\n        \u25e6 Business cycles aren\u2019t cycles \u2013 they\u2019re fluctuations. The fact that there\u2019s been a long duration since the last period of negative growth doesn\u2019t make it more likely that we\u2019ll see negative growth soon. But don\u2019t take my word for it \u2013 here\u2019s the evidence.\n        \u25e6 Open this link, which has 5 graphs I generated, and have it handy while you read this post (https://imgur.com/a/YC9l1BJ).\n        \u25e6 For each quarter from 1947 \u2013 2017, I calculated a) the duration of the business cycle up to this point and b) whether or not the next quarter is negative. [SEE GRAPH 1]. Notice how there is no strong pattern to whether or not a data point (= a quarter) appears on the bottom or the top. If longer business cycles were more likely to lead to negative growth next cycle, we would see data points crowded around the bottom-left and top-right. (Note: because the spreadsheet software lets points sit on top of each other, this does hide the duplicate data points \u2013 sorry! but it gets the idea across).\n        \u25e6 I also generated a simple regression model and a generalized linear model to test whether the duration of the cycle affects the probability of next quarter being negative \u2013 none of my models showed a statistically significant effect (p = 0.2927 and 0.294 respectively, where p < 0.1 or p < 0.05 would give evidence of a trend; also, effect sizes were very small).\n        \u25e6 I also made a graph of the length of business cycles (i.e. the # of quarters of positive growth in a row) [SEE GRAPH 2]. Compare to a roughly representative distribution of random numbers [SEE GRAPH 3]. The business cycle data is skewed compared to random numbers \u2013 we\u2019re more likely to see shorter cycles. (To be clear, these graphs are simply an ordered list of business cycle lengths \u2013 on the y-axis is length, and the x-axis is meaningless.)\n        \u25e6 But notice that there are loads of 1\u2019s and 2\u2019s \u2013 which is not meaningful for today, as we\u2019re currently in the 18th consecutive quarter of growth. Removing 1\u2019s and 2\u2019s and repeating the above graphs gives the real data [SEE GRAPH 4] and the random numbers [SEE GRAPH 5]. They look much more similar. (Removing the 1\u2019s from the linear models above made the models even weaker.)\n        \u25e6 Combining all this data makes it very hard to believe that longer cycles make it more likely to see negative growth next quarter.     \u2022 Shape of the yield curve\n        \u25e6 I\u2019ve seen some claims that the slope of the yield curve / treasury spread is a strong predictor of recessions \u2013 these people claim that a negative slope means there\u2019s a high probability of a recession.\n        \u25e6 I downloaded historical data from here (https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/capital_markets/ycfaq.html)\n        \u25e6 The same data appears on this PDF, which shows that negative treasury spreads tend to appear before recessions (https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/capital_markets/Prob_Rec.pdf)\n        \u25e6 This dataset calculates the slope of the yield curve as 10 year bond rate minus 3 month bill rate (bond equivalent basis). Note that the data starts in 1959.\n        \u25e6 First, I converted the monthly data to quarterly by producing averages for each three months.\n        \u25e6 The periods of negative growth over 2+ quarters happen in: 1970; 1974; 1980; 1982; 1991; and 2008. The periods where the treasury spread was negative begin in: 1966; 1969; 1973; 1978; 1980; 1989; 2000; 2006. \n            \u25aa That means, if we take the treasury spread as a prediction saying \u201cthere will be a recession in the next 1-2 years\u201d, there are 6 out of 8 predictions that are correct, and 0 times when a recession was missed. How cool is that!\n        \u25e6 I\u2019m a little blown away by the agreement here \u2013 it looks like the treasury spread is a good predictor of recessions after all. But how strong is it for our purposes?\n            \u25aa Firstly, there\u2019s a time lag \u2013 for the 6 periods of 2+ period negative growth above, after the spread falls below 0, there\u2019s (on average) an 5.2-quarter lag until the onset of negative growth. So negative spread means that there\u2019ll probably be a recession in a year and a bit.\n            \u25aa For 2018 Q3, the spread was 0.848. We don\u2019t have data for Dec 2018, but the first two-thirds of 2018 Q4 had an average spread of 0.800. Indeed, the spread has been declining steadily since mid-2017.\n            \u25aa Let\u2019s take the 0.8 threshold \u2013 how many times after a spread of 0.8, where we don\u2019t just skip straight to negative spread, does a recession happen? In other words, if we find ourselves with a spread of 0.8 or less, is this a sign of an impeding recession?\n                \u2022 1959-60 (no recession); 1963-1967 (no recession); 1967-70 (recession); 1973-4 (recession); 1989-90 (recession, but later); 1995 (no recession); 1997-9 (no recession); 2000 (no recession); 2005-7 (recession, but later)\n                \u2022 This means that periods that have spreads as low as we currently have are about as likely to have a recession as not have a recession \u2013 just under a 50% rate. But in none of these did the recession appear within 3 quarters. This matches what I found above, with a time lag between low yield and negative growth.\n            \u25aa So, every period of double negative growth since 1959 has been preceded by negative treasury spread. When we see negative treasury spread, we\u2019re likely to have a recession within just over a year (historical minimum is 3 quarters).\n            \u25aa But there is no case since 1959 where there has been a recession without having seen positive treasury spread. So while it's possible our declining treasury spread is evidence that a recession is coming, the probability of seeing it in the next 3 quarters is quite low."], [66029, "2019-01-07T03:49:12Z", [0.15], ""], [66026, "2019-01-07T03:43:52Z", [0.33], ""], [66025, "2019-01-07T03:39:30Z", [0.65], ""], [66018, "2019-01-07T03:30:00Z", [0.6], ""], [66012, "2019-01-07T03:28:54Z", [0.75], "We're overdue for a recession, if history is a guide. \nAlso, the Fed kept rates too low for too long after the crash in 2008.

Average rate of growth is 3.22%.\n    2. 41 periods have experienced negative real GDP growth.\n    3. In 10 instances has there been 2+ negative real GDP growth \u2013 7 instances of double-period negative growth; 2 instances of triple-period; and 1 instance of quadruple-period.\n    4. For these instances, for the quarter before the onset of negative growth, the average rate was 2.2%. The rate of Q3 2018 was 3.4% - only in 2 out of 10 instances has this occurred. (Will need to update once I see Q4 2018 rate.)\n    5. If you look at four quarters before the onset of negative growth, the average rate was 2.83%. Today, the rate of the last four quarters is 3.02% - only in 3 out of 10 of the aforementioned instances has the rate been this high.\n    6. The correlation between the growth rate for one quarter and the growth rate for the next quarter is 36%. This is better than random, but only moderately so. (There is no apparent correlation for data since 2009, which may be an artifact of small sample size.)\n    7. Although growth has declined over time, there is no evidence of a change in frequency of instances of negative growth over time. Calculating the probability\n    \u2022 41 periods over 286 quarters makes 14.34%. So probability of a period having negative growth is 14.34%, and positive growth 85.66%.\n      You can do a simple possibility tree with pen and paper. Of the 28 possible options for Q1 \u2013 Q4 each being positive or negative, only 8 include 2+ negative periods in a row. Numbers in brackets indicate all four probabilities multiplied.\n        \u25e6 Q1 negative, Q2 negative, Q3 negative, Q4 negative (0.04223%)\n        \u25e6 Q1 negative, Q2 negative, Q3 negative, Q4 positive (0.2524%)\n        \u25e6 Q1 negative, Q2 negative, Q3 positive, Q4 negative (0.2524%)\n        \u25e6 Q1 negative, Q2 negative, Q3 positive, Q4 positive (1.508%)\n        \u25e6 Q1 negative, Q2 positive, Q3 negative, Q4 negative (0.2524%)\n        \u25e6 Q1 positive, Q2 positive, Q3 negative, Q4 negative (1.508%)\n        \u25e6 Q1 positive, Q2 negative, Q3 negative, Q4 negative (0.2524%)\n        \u25e6 Q1 positive, Q2 negative, Q3 negative, Q4 positive (1.508%)\n      These probabilities sum to 5.58%.\n    \u2022 Alternatively (and this will be less rigorous and more open to variance in the data), we can look at the observed probabilities of each duration of negative growth:\n        \u25e6 P(Two consecutive periods) = 7/285 = 2.456%\n        \u25e6 P(Three consecutive periods) = 2/284 = 0.7042%\n        \u25e6 P(Four consecutive periods) = 1/283 = 0.3534%\n      These numbers are similar to the 14.34% to the power of 2, 3 or 4, respectively. But they\u2019re bigger. That\u2019s because of the correlation I mentioned above \u2013 negative growth quarters tend to follow each other; they\u2019re clumped.\n      Then, if 2019 involves 2+ consecutive periods of growth, there are three probabilities: 2 periods, 3 periods, or 4 periods. Simply summing the probabilities gets us to 3.514%. Not far off of the previous estimate \u2013 but I wouldn\u2019t put too much stock into this number, because of the low sample sizes of 3-4 consecutive period making sound probability estimates difficult. On the other hand\n    \u2022 If you consider that, simply put, over 73 years, there has been 10 periods of 2+ quarter growth; the probability of going into one of these in 2019 is 13.70%. If you reduce this by a quarter (as entering in Q4 doesn\u2019t count for the question), you get 10.27%.\n    \u2022 Averaging this with my 5.58% estimate gives 7.925%. Adjusting up and down\n    \u2022 Given points 4 \u2013 7 in my first paragraph, the period we\u2019re in today doesn\u2019t share the characteristics common to periods of negative growth. So I will adjust our estimate down. It\u2019s tricky to calculate exactly how much, as any given group of four periods is inherently artificial. But the correlation between years is 36% (see 6), and in 70-80% of 2+ negative-growth periods the conditions are worse than today. So reducing the probability by about 30% seems roughly correct.\n    \u2022 So my call is 7.925% * 0.7 = 5.548%"], [19801, "2019-01-05T04:42:05Z", [0.45], "The troublesome part of this forecast is that is counts only 2 consecutive quarters, so if there is any spacing that would invalidate a recession call. The US economy is a Weekend at Bernies Economy. It may seem superficially great, running around having a great time. But the economy is already dead. https://inkyed.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/picture-271.png The only issue is the precise definition of 2 quarters in 2019, which could happen in 2020 instead. Likewise the US BEA has failed to detect recessions when they are happening before. The committee's approach to determining the dates of turning points is retrospective. We wait until sufficient data are available to avoid the need for major revisions. In particular, in determining the date of a peak in activity, and thus the onset of recession, we wait until we are confident that, even in the event that activity begins to rise again immediately, it has declined enough to meet the criterion of depth. As a result, we tend to wait to identify a peak until many months after it actually occurs.\nhttps://www.nber.org/cycles/jan2003.html Hanged by their own words.
