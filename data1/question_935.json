So far only two applications according to [1] so I am guessing chance of >3 is close to nil.  The DMV has been able to approve applications since 30 days after April 2 [2] and Waymo applied in April so supposedly their application should be relatively far along. However, it is common to underestimate public agency processes, which is one of the reasons I am leaning toward 0. California doesn't want to let AZ take business away [3], but at the same time I doubt there is serious impetus for tech companies to suddenly start moving to AZ over this. The timeline for the question is quite short considering that regulators are dealing with a new and potentially incident-causing technology.

This is the first time such an application is evaluated; there's presumably little process in place, the bureaucracy has no experience handling this type of request. There aren't any deadlines either. So as a baseline we should guess this will take very long. The much simpler processes of obtaining various immigration documents take several months each. Now let's look at incentives. Arizona has already allowed anyone to do anything with driverless cars, as far as I can tell. If I am a regulator, I feel I'd wait to see how that goes for a while, before giving my approval. I stand to lose if I give approval and then people get killed. And I stand to gain nothing by approving quickly. (Or so it seems to me.) So another reason to delay.
