This is less than the four week moving average of a month ago, which was 248.5k.

Unemployment figure stands at 4.3% for May. Jobless claims have also fallen to a 16-year low, suggestion the economy is close to full employment. For it to drop before 4 would be very unlikely, but possible, given (1) continued low energy costs (e.g. low crude oil prices) and (2) potential legislation to reduce/eliminate financial regulations. Conversely, an unforeseen global event (e.g. Venezuelan default, triggering a worldwide financial panic) could put a halt in hiring and cause an uptick in unemployment. https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-jobless-claims-fell-last-week-1496925115\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/house-set-to-pass-bill-rolling-back-wall-street-rules-1496914205"], [34353, "2017-06-08T11:53:33Z", [0.0, 0.85, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [691, "2017-06-08T11:29:52Z", [0.0, 0.85, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [368, "2017-06-07T19:26:19Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.95, 0.0], ""], [31238, "2017-06-07T17:35:35Z", [0.0, 0.8, 0.2, 0.0], ""], [28091, "2017-06-07T15:23:28Z", [0.0, 0.75, 0.25, 0.0], ""], [33035, "2017-06-07T14:41:56Z", [0.05, 0.45, 0.45, 0.05], ""], [34353, "2017-06-07T11:57:40Z", [0.0, 0.85, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [368, "2017-06-06T18:19:47Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.95, 0.0], ""], [33917, "2017-06-06T13:22:56Z", [0.0, 0.4, 0.6, 0.0], ""], [691, "2017-06-06T12:22:55Z", [0.0, 0.84, 0.16, 0.0], ""], [34353, "2017-06-06T11:54:44Z", [0.0, 0.85, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [32723, "2017-06-06T10:30:47Z", [0.3, 0.57, 0.11, 0.02], "Anfangs wird sie sinken und  dann wird sie im Laufe von Trumps Regierungszeit wieder steigen"], [34725, "2017-06-06T05:09:52Z", [0.0, 0.95, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [30260, "2017-06-06T03:29:01Z", [0.0, 0.82, 0.17, 0.01], ""], [35523, "2017-06-06T01:35:55Z", [0.0, 0.89, 0.1, 0.01], ""], [35523, "2017-06-06T01:35:12Z", [0.0, 0.85, 0.1, 0.05], ""], [368, "2017-06-05T17:24:37Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.95, 0.0], ""], [31802, "2017-06-05T14:16:05Z", [0.05, 0.75, 0.2, 0.0], "When we look at the data from 2007 till now, the change of the unemployment rate between May and July was never more positive than +0.4% (2009) and never more negative than -0.3% (2015).
