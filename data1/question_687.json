More than two months after its Sept. 24 national election, Europe\u2019s economic and political powerhouse is still without a government and officials say coalition talks may now properly begin only in the new year. \u201cThere are European elections in 2019... so there is a big expectation that we take positions,\u201d she told reporters, referring to proposals by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and by French President Emmanuel Macron on the future governance of the EU\u2019s currency and economic union. Merkel also cited conflicts in the Middle East, tensions with Russia and relations with the United States as factors that required a Germany \u201ccapable of acting\u201d. David McAllister, an executive committee member of Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats (CDU), echoed her views in comments to Reuters, adding that Germany needed to iron out its stance on key EU issues ahead of European Parliament elections in 2019 (para. 1-5).

Two were his rebellious partners, who failed to do so: the Bavarian Social Democrats, the Liberals and her \"friends\" Csu. Both were stubborn about the issue of stopping the reunion of family members of refugees from war zones, a ridiculous question for two reasons. One, because the two-year break in 2016 ends in March 2018, and in any case, two, under strong suspicion of unconstitutionality, since Grundgesetz specifically protects the family. SIDE NOTE: A party called \"Christian\" wants to prevent the arrival of family members from areas under the bombs and / or Assad is not just sad, but painful - since it is numerically small, a few dozen of thousands of people, women and children, who would surely make the males more peaceful and integrable. Two issues emerged: Merkel lost her grip on leadership, and negatively highlighted the political stature of liberal leader Lindner, the main author of the breakup. However, not all damage comes to harm. Europe should rejoice. The idea of Fdp (Liberals) was the clear return to the anti-Draghi times. With the Liberals to the Government, Germany would become a major unifying brake towards the sharing of risks and benefits.  The Euro may come down now, for the benefit of EU exports. The most difficult task lies with Merkel: to acknowledge her failure and to withdraw. Or, if still possible, her resurgence from the ashes of the disastrous election result for her and the Cdu / Csu and show that she really had a broad-minded political project. As consolation prize for Germany, the economy is growing as it has never been for years, the sixth in a row, full of employment and personal scarcity everywhere: now Germany also makes the Spanish and Italian experiences that weak governments are doing well to the economy and if Germany comes out slightly lowered, smaller, it is not a bad thing.

Additionally, CDU and Left Party are highly unlikely ever to form a coalition. Mathematically, the SPD cannot form a government, because SPD + LINKE + GRUENE < 355 necessary for majority.  Option 1: \nThe left and Green Party, without the FDP, is most likely in a leftist coalition of SPD + Green + LEFT. However, this does not form a majority. It would require the AFD to join. However, this would not create a working government. \nAs a result, I view the likelihood of this occurring at 1%.  Option 2: \nThe economic policies of the LEFT and FDP are pretty much directly contradictory, as the LEFT contains the SED, which governed East Germany, and the FDP is the most pro-business party in the German Bundestag. As a result, I view the likelihood of this occurring at 1% as well.  Option 3: \nThe Green Party and the FDP would govern in a coalition with the CDU/CSU. This is known as the Jamaica coalition. The coalition would have significant tensions, but it is possible, because it is in the interests of all the parties to compromise, because no one knows what a new election would bring. Additionally, this is the opportunity for the Greens and the FDP to implement their policies. I think the negotiations may be protracted, but that this is the most likely option. Consequently, I rate this at 60%.  Option 4: \nI don't think that having the LEFT and the FDP in a coalition would be stable. The only possibility of this occurring would be in a national crisis, in which a grand coalition of major parties is necessary. This could conceivably occur in a war with Russia, but I view this as unlikely. Otherwise, such a coalition is unlikely, because of ideological challenges, and because the Jamaica coalition would give the majority necessary. I rate this possibility 1%.  Option 5: \nOption 5 wins if no government is formed and new elections are held. This would be possible if the current Jamaica coalition talks collapse. This would require all parties believing that they have a stronger position after a new election. However, as no one knows what would happen, this is highly risky. As a result, I view this as a distinct possibility, but less likely than a Jamaica coalition. I give this the possibility of the remaining 37%. \n"], [35636, "2017-11-11T03:53:21Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], "Wisdom of the crowds bandwagoning here, got no interest or history of Merkel and German politics.
