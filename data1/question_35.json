Plus, Titanic was a REAL story with fictional characters thrown in.  Brilliant marketing for mixing history with fiction.  Look at the volumes Dan Brown has sold in his books by doing the same thing.  Jurassic World was a fabulous fictional roller coaster of a ride movie.  However, it doesn't have the substance that Titanic had to reach that level of activity.  Even with mass marketing.  Even with ticket sales more expensive than when Titanic came out.

Months to go find a measly $7 million, and Christmas coming up, why the hell wouldn't it?!?\" A couple reasons, apparently: 1. Recent box office history - the film did only $208k this weekend, and $296k last week, with a pretty consistent drop in box office revenue since its opening (http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekly&id=jurassicpark4.htm ). Put this against what it would need to do to hit the mark ($7.6 mill in revenue / 11.4 weeks to end of year = $667k in weekly box office) it doesn't look good. 2. Christmas! The holiday film season is the second best box office period for the studios, and the best per day (http://www.boxofficemojo.com/seasonal/?chart=byseason&season=Holiday&view=releasedate ). Because of this, the major studios open a number of new releases between now and Christmas (http://www.boxofficemojo.com/schedule/?view=bydate&release=all&date=2015-10-02&showweeks=5&p=.htm ). Both the studios (who make most of their money in the early weeks by taking a higher cut of the tickets sales) and the theatres (who are happy to give up ticket share for full theatres of concessions visiting patrons) won't want more screens taken up by an old release that's barely doing $1500 in ticket sales per screening. With these two items in mind, I think it's highly unlikely that the picture will beat Titanic. Of course, who's to say it couldn't have some unprecedented experience in second run theatres? Maybe North Americans really hit the theatres this year, and the first run stuff is disappointing. Anything is possible, right?

Checking the link above, it seems the weekly gross sales decrease from an approximate 30 - 50% from the previous week over time.   In this movie the last few weekly changes were highly variable but possibly related to the long holiday weekend or other factors.   From September 4 - 10 weekly gross declined by 9.6% but the following week, September 11 - 17, declined by 59.5%.   The average decline for those is 34.5%.  This is within the range of weekly gross decline earlier for this movie as well as seen for a number of other movies as mentioned above.   So, estimating the weekly gross based on a 34.5% decrease by week calculated to be an additional 2.7 Million by week 8 at which time the weekly gross was estimated, using this concept, to be around $51,000.    Assuming the movie continued to run through the end of the year (14 weeks) based on this approach the movie will have made no more than an additional 2.83 Million by the end of the year, much less than the 8.8 million necessary to pass Titanic."], [379, "2015-09-22T16:12:21Z", [0.2], "Too much competition."], [102, "2015-09-22T15:48:59Z", [0.95], "Actually looking at the numbers it seems like it could make $9MM more in 16 weeks, that's $560K/week spread across entire US.

I focused on these high grossing movies because they likely have a lifespan in theaters most analogous to JW, and I used only movies from the recent past (farthest back I went was 2012) so as to avoid, as much as possible, historical fluctuations in moviegoer attendance, changes in average ticket price, and other compounding factors. Analysis: JW is nearing the $1M weekly earning threshold. After that point, all movies I examined continued to make several $100K/wk, but only added around $3-4M to total sales before being pulled from theaters. The exception to this was Marvel's The Avengers, which grossed an additional $7.8M after first dropping below the $1M weekly threshold. Part of this anomaly was due to a significant resurgence in earnings the week of Aug 31st. This spike at the end of August is noticeable in data for other films, and it is present for JW. However, after this late-August spike, ticket sales continue to decline in a similar fashion as before the increase. In addition, these blockbusters seem to get pulled from theaters after weekly sales drop into the $100-300K range and are only playing in a few hundred theaters. JW is still playing in over 1K theaters, but these appear to be smaller venues as the earnings are half what they were for a comparable number of theaters in early August. As others have noted, there are not likely to be other big blockbusters coming out soon that will draw audiences away from JW, but the same circumstances were true for other big-ticket summer movies like The Avengers, yet ticket sales for those movies releasing at a similar time still continued declining noticeably on a weekly basis. Conclusion: JW weekly sales, while still strong, will likely fall below the $1M threshold in the coming weeks. At that point it is unlikely JW will total the $8.8M required to top Titanic in all time domestic sales. If in three weeks time JW is still earning above $1M a week I will revise my forecast upwards."], [1646, "2015-09-21T02:40:55Z", [0.99], "Because children.

There was a sudden bump on the weekend of August 29th, followed by continuing decline (I assume the bump was caused by release to secondary theatres, or something like that).  If the decline continues at the 40% rate, Jurassic World will make another $2million or so, well short of the $9million it needs to overtake Titanic.  Other similar movies (see [2] for Marvel's The Avengers) seem to follow a similar pattern, with a single bump in gross.
