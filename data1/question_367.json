Also, the US has 5 of the top 10 Jewish populated cities in the world and the majority of Jews are Zionists.  The Zionist lobby is very strong in Washington.  President Trump has tasked Jared Kushner with solving the problem.  Unless Israel grows new land or Egypt is willing to change its borders, the Palestinians and Jews in Israel will stay in a constant state of unrest that causes regular violence.  In my opinion, rather than assigning anyone with the task of solving the problem, we leave Israel alone and occasionally scold them when their human rights abuses become too egregious.  I know my point of view is isolationist and cold, but the US is comfortable with these type allies.

Speaking in Gaza City, Mahmoud al-Zahar, a regular critic of Israel, said the political policy document announced in Qatar on May 1 by Hamas's outgoing chief Khaled Meshaal did not contradict its founding covenant, published in 1988. Trailed for weeks by Hamas officials, the document appeared to be an attempt to soften the group's language toward Israel. But it still called for \"the liberation of all of historical Palestine\", said armed resistance was a means to achieve that goal, and did not recognize Israel's right to exist. \"The pledge Hamas made before God was to liberate all of Palestine,\" Zahar said on Wednesday. \"The charter is the core of (Hamas's) position and the mechanism of this position is the document.\" Many Western countries classify Hamas as a terrorist group over its failure to renounce violence, recognize Israel's right to exist, and accept existing interim Israeli-Palestinian peace agreements. In its new document, Hamas said it agrees to a transitional Palestinian state within frontiers pre-dating the 1967 Middle East war but continues to oppose recognizing Israel's right to exist and backs an armed struggle. Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who heads the rival Fatah movement that controls the Israeli-occupied West Bank, recognizes Israel and seeks a final peace agreement based on those lines. U.S. President Donald Trump will meet Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when he visits the region later this month, and a summit to restart peace talks stalled since 2014 has been mentioned in media reports (para. 1-7).

Hamas has accused Israel of being behind the killing of Mazen Fuqaha, 38, a senior commander in the militant Islamist movement\u2019s military wing. He spent nine years in an Israeli prison for his part in planning suicide bombings that killed dozens of Israeli civilians during the second intifada, or uprising, in the early 2000s.  Fuqaha was one of more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners released in 2011 in exchange for Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. Upon his release, Fuqaha was barred from returning to his childhood village in the West Bank and expelled to the Gaza Strip. From there, he managed Hamas\u2019s military operations in the West Bank.  His death has brought tensions between Israel and Hamas to their highest level since 2014, when the two sides fought a 50-day war that killed about 74 Israelis and more than 2,100 Palestinians. This is the first-time Hamas has closed the Erez crossing, a checkpoint most frequently used by Gazans seeking health care in Israel and the West Bank. Erez is also used by aid workers and foreign journalists seeking to enter Gaza. Gaza also has a crossing into Egypt, but that is almost permanently closed. Hamas, which Israel and the United States consider a terrorist organization, set up checkpoints across Gaza in pursuit of those who might have been involved in Fuqaha\u2019s killing. \u201cWe say it clearly that the crime was planned and conducted by the Zionist enemy. And the enemy will be responsible for the crime consequences,\u201d Hamas\u2019s military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said in a statement (para.1-7). Eglash, R. & Balousha, H. (2017).

Nichols (2017) March 24, states that: Israel has ignored a demand by the United Nations Security Council to halt settlement building and some Palestinian groups are continuing to incite violence against Jews, U.N. Middle East envoy Nickolay Mladenov told the 15-member body on Friday. It was Mladenov's first report on the implementation a Dec. 23 resolution adopted by the council with 14 votes in favor and a U.S. abstention. Then President-elect Donald Trump and Israel had urged Washington to wield its veto. \"The resolution calls on Israel to take steps 'to cease all settlements activities in the occupied Palestinian territory including east Jerusalem.' No such steps have been taken during the reporting period,\" Mladenov told the council. Israel for decades has pursued a policy of constructing Jewish settlements on territory captured by Israel in a 1967 war with its Arab neighbors. Most countries view Israeli settlement activity as illegal and an obstacle to peace. Israel disagrees. The Palestinians want an independent state in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem. \"Many of the advancements that were made in the past three months will further sever the territorial contiguity of a future Palestinian state and accelerate the fragmentation of the West Bank,\" said Mladenov of settlements, adding that they were \"one of the main obstacles to peace.\" Mladenov also said an increase in rockets fired from Gaza toward Israel was a \"worrying development\" and described it as regrettable that Palestinian Authority officials had not condemned attacks against Israelis. \"The continued incitement to violence against Jews emanating from Hamas extremists and some Palestinian groups is unacceptable and undermines trust and the prospects for peace,\" he said. \"Reactions by Hamas officials to terror attacks against Israelis have been particularly reprehensible and deserve condemnation,\" Mladenov said. The United States traditionally shields Israel, Washington's long-time ally that receives more than $3 billion in annual U.S. military aid, from council action. The five council veto powers are the United States, Russia, France, Britain and China. The resolution, put forward by New Zealand, Malaysia, Venezuela and Senegal a day after Egypt withdrew it under pressure from Israel and Trump, was the first adopted by the council on Israel and the Palestinians in nearly eight years (para. 1-11).

U.N. Under-Secretary General and ESCWA Executive Secretary Rima Khalaf said she was leaving after \"powerful member states\" had pressured the world body and its chief with \"vicious attacks and threats\". Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said in a televised speech on Saturday that the incident served as a reminder of the \"truth of this organization, that it's weak ... and it succumbs to the will of the United States and Israel\". The U.N. is \"incapable of taking a stand\" and the debacle over the report proved it cannot be counted on \"to defend human rights in our region,\" he said. Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization's executive committee, also criticized the decision and called on the report to be reinstated.\nESCWA, which comprises 18 Arab states, published the report on Wednesday and said it was the first time a U.N. body had clearly charged that Israel \"has established an apartheid regime that dominates the Palestinian people as a whole\" (para. 1-7).

Just as the British foreign secretary\u2019s 1917 declaration considered only how the Zionist movement could serve the interests of the greatest power of its day, so has the recent speech of the US secretary of state, John Kerry, advocating a two-state solution addressed mainly the interests of today\u2019s superpower and its prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Israel. There has been some progress since 1917: there is no mention whatsoever of Palestinians or Arabs in the Balfour Declaration, whereas Kerry paid ample lip service to the Palestinians, albeit always in relation to Israel\u2019s concerns and desires.\nLost in the uproar caused in some circles by the condemnation of Israeli settlements embodied in Kerry\u2019s speech and in UN security council resolution 2334 is the fact that, in line with previous US policies on Palestine, both ignore basic rights of the Palestinian people, and the requirements of international law, of justice and of equity.\nHowever, this is not just about Israel\u2019s metastasizing colonial settlement project, important though that is. Much as they may have enraged Israel\u2019s government and its American enablers, the Obama/Kerry parameters and UNSC 2334 are simply inadequate as the basis for a lasting solution. This problem did not start in 1967, and it will not disappear simply by resolving the settlement issue, which in any case neither parameters nor resolution will do (para. 1-2). Khalidi, R. (2016).
