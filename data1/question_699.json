Late deciders usually break significantly against established parties.  Five stars current softening of positions is smart politics, meant to make the party more acceptable to timid voters; hardline 5 star voters have nowhere to go; there is no downside.  Illegal immigration with resulting unemployment is pushing people to vote, I do not believe it will be an apathetic turnout among 5 star voters.  That said, the rosatelllum's implications will penalize 5Star regional and proportional voting. However, the greater the voting percentage, the less the effective penalty.   The 3% threshold will ameliorate this a small amount.  The largest result of the current rules is that italy will have unified opposition and a fractured unstable government.   5star is the clearest vote for eurosceptism and one of two votes for italian nationalism.  I think 5 star is going to out perform the vote on italian islands and south.  Chamber of deputies has 630.  Of these 12 are elected by expats, none of which will go 5 Star. \nLets divide the electorate into two haves - the 50% that are already decided, and the 50% that are undecided. So 309 multiplied by 27.5 (last poll) yields roughly 86 deputies. \nTo get 201 votes,  5Star only needs to win 37% of the electorate.    This is a very volatile election - there is way more than a 10% chance 5 star will hit that target, even with proportionality penalties.  Alternate scenario: 2/3 of voters set, 1/3 uncertain.\n116 delegates.  What percent does five star have to get to get to 201 = 41.4 % of the vote undecided vote.

The new law is summarised here: https://globalriskinsights.com/2017/11/italy-rosatellum-bis-primer/\nThe key features are:\n- There will be 630 Deputies elected to the Chamber\n- A PR/FPTP split, with 37% of the Deputies elected on FPTP (232) and 61% on PR (386). (12 Deputies are also elected to represent overseas populations)\n- The country is split into 20 constituencies with a varying number of Deputies elected What this will mean:\n- Parties with both a strong local base and high overall voting percentages will do well\n- Parties in coalition will do better in the FPTP part of the election, as they avoid splitting their vote With all that in mind, we should also note that the 5SM opposed this system strongly as they both reject the idea of pre-election coalitions and their vote is spread fairly evenly rather than concentrated in certain parts of the country. It was felt that this would harm their chances under the new electoral system. With all that in mind, the polling indicates (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_Italian_general_election,_2018)\n that the 5SM:\n- will win c. 28% of the vote in the PR elections. This would translate into around 109 seats.\n- will win c. 28% of the vote in the FPTP elections, well behind the centre-right coalition who are above 35%. If this were proportional, it would mean 65 seats. The 5SM have previously performed well in Liguria, Marche, Sardinia and Sicily, while performing worse in Trentino, Lombardy and Campania. It shoudl be noted that the two largest constituencies in the country are Lobardy and Campania, where 5SM perform poorly, while Liguria, Sardinia and Marche are all among the smallest.

It seems that M5S has painted itself into a corner with its message eventhough Luigi Di Maio is putting forth a slicker and slightly more moderate image.  The only problem is this message may start overlapping with the right-wing Forza, League and a potential centrist PD coalition who have more regional ties and historically a more persistent culturally ingrained message. Berlusconi, a master at coalition formation, will absorb centrists falling away from the PD coalition.\nM5S is doing well in the national polling however, the new election law allows only one pick on each ballot. It is quite possible that people with regional interests will forgo the M5S candidate and stay with their regional alliances. M5S will not live up to expectations in the first-past-the-post ballot.\n   If M5S starts polling a few points over 32% I will have to think about revising upward but I think that any coalition Berlusconi creates will prevail in the elections and capture the largest segment of the population which is between the ages of 40 and 54.  \n\"Old age and treachery will always beat youth and exuberance.\"\n "], [46388, "2018-01-05T17:34:10Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.6, 0.3, 0.0], ""], [46356, "2018-01-05T16:46:23Z", [0.03, 0.05, 0.35, 0.55, 0.02], ""], [691, "2018-01-05T16:20:15Z", [0.0, 0.24, 0.7, 0.06, 0.0], ""], [46079, "2018-01-05T15:01:28Z", [0.12, 0.18, 0.4, 0.25, 0.05], ""], [28414, "2018-01-05T12:37:26Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [28414, "2018-01-05T12:37:17Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.95, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [46557, "2018-01-05T09:28:05Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95, 0.0], ""], [18386, "2018-01-05T08:26:26Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.9, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [43311, "2018-01-05T05:39:22Z", [0.0, 0.2, 0.7, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [46416, "2018-01-05T03:44:20Z", [0.3, 0.4, 0.3, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [23006, "2018-01-04T23:41:20Z", [0.1, 0.15, 0.65, 0.05, 0.05], ""], [27461, "2018-01-04T22:16:48Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.85, 0.15, 0.0], "If anything, M5S seems to be gaining in the December polls  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_Italian_general_election%2C_2018)"], [46407, "2018-01-04T21:38:53Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.3, 0.7, 0.0], ""], [46369, "2018-01-04T21:16:14Z", [0.0, 0.32, 0.6, 0.08, 0.0], ""], [46376, "2018-01-04T20:24:26Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.9, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [42099, "2018-01-04T18:18:46Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.4, 0.6, 0.0], ""], [46103, "2018-01-04T16:30:35Z", [0.3, 0.3, 0.4, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [35149, "2018-01-04T15:46:40Z", [0.0, 0.25, 0.7, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [23355, "2018-01-04T13:34:26Z", [0.0, 0.5, 0.35, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2018-01-04T13:01:07Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.75, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [21884, "2018-01-04T08:18:14Z", [0.0, 0.07, 0.67, 0.25, 0.01], ""], [15196, "2018-01-04T05:38:37Z", [0.0, 0.4, 0.6, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [23006, "2018-01-04T03:37:30Z", [0.1, 0.15, 0.65, 0.05, 0.05], ""], [45721, "2018-01-03T16:53:02Z", [0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.4, 0.0], ""], [45976, "2018-01-03T13:37:12Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.55, 0.3, 0.05], ""], [45930, "2018-01-03T08:33:15Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [45921, "2018-01-03T07:45:47Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.85, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [68, "2018-01-03T07:11:28Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.9, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [45885, "2018-01-03T03:45:03Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [43709, "2018-01-02T23:09:45Z", [0.02, 0.12, 0.67, 0.17, 0.02], "On recent polling, M5S score around 25-30%, giving 100-119 of the proportionally allocated seats in the chamber of deputies.

Voters will elect the 630 members of the Chamber of Deputies and the 315 elective members of the Senate of the Republic for the 18th term of the Italian Parliament. BACKGROUND\nAt the 2013 general election neither of the three main groupings, the centre-right led by Silvio Berlusconi, the centre-left led by Pier Luigi Bersani and the Five Star Movement (M5S) led by Beppe Grillo, won an outright majority in Parliament. After a failed attempt by Bersani, then-secretary of the Democratic Party (PD), to form a government and Giorgio Napolitano's re-election as President, Enrico Letta, Bersani's deputy, received the task of forming a grand coalition government. The Letta Cabinet consisted of the PD, Berlusconi's The People of Freedom (PdL) \u2013 which would be replaced by the New Centre-Right (NCD) in November 2013 \u2013, Civic Choice (SC), the Union of the Centre (UdC), one Radical and three independents. Following the election of Matteo Renzi as PD secretary in December 2013, there were persistent tensions culminating in Letta's resignation in February 2014. Subsequently, Renzi formed a cabinet based on the same coalition (including the NCD). The new Prime Minister had a strong mandate from his party and was reinforced by the PD's strong showing in the 2014 European Parliament election and the election of Sergio Mattarella, a fellow Democrat, as President in 2015. Well into 2016, opinion polls registered the PD's strength and a growth of the M5S, Lega Nord (LN) and Brothers of Italy (FdI), while emphasizing a decline of Forza Italia (FI) \u2013 which had replaced the PdL in November 2013 \u2013, the virtual disappearance of Civic Choice (SC) and the replacement of Left Ecology Freedom (SEL) with Italian Left (SI). In December 2016 Renzi was defeated in a constitutional referendum (59% to 41%). Under the reform, the Senate would have been composed of 100 members: 95 regional reprentatives and 5 presidential appointees. Following this defeat, Renzi stepped down as Prime Minister and was replaced by Paolo Gentiloni, another Democrat. In early 2017, some left-wing Democrats led by Bersani and Roberto Speranza launched, along with SI splinters, the Democratic and Progressive Movement (MDP). Also to the left of the PD, Giuliano Pisapia, a former Mayor of Milan, launched the Progressive Camp (CP), while, to the right, the NCD was transformed into Popular Alternative (AP). In April Renzi was re-elected secretary of the PD and thus candidate for Prime Minister. In May Salvini was re-elected federal secretary of the LN and launched his own campaign. In September Luigi Di Maio was selected as candidate for Prime Minister and \"political head\" of the M5S.

There are talks of Pietro Grasso (now President of the Senate; a respected former Anti-Mafia prosecutor), that  plans to ally himself with Bersani (former head of the PD before Renzi), and form a new party with Grasso as head. Polls are already favorable to such an outcome. M5S has no clear ideological identity, it bases its appeal on the fight against Italy\u2019s rampant corruption and pledges to break down the privileges of its political and business elite. But they are a bit late on that, as the Majors of Rome and Torino are embroiled in scandals and inability to govern. Likewise right after the recent stunning regional votes in favor of M5S, a series of corruption scandals emerged to prove that they are no saints either! 30-year-old Luigi Di Maio, who is widely expected to be the party\u2019s candidate for prime minister at the next election; is gaffe-prone and totally unexperienced.

The division of seat allocation of 630 Chamber of Deputies (CoD) is as follows:\na) 232 seats are directly elected in member districts\nb) 386 are elected by national proportional representation.\nc) 12 are elected by the Italians abroad. 2. Parties can choose to run as coalitions and these coalitions if winning more than 40% of vote will be allocated no fewer than 340 seats to achieve plurality in the CoD. 3. My assumption is that no party on it's own will win either absolute plurality (51% of the vote) or achieve 40% needed to secure the 340 seat allocation.\na) Based on polling data M5S YTD popularity has been 28,06%, followed by Democratic Party (27,56), Lega Nord (13,50%) and Forza Italia (13,04%). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_Italian_general_election,_2018#2017\nhttps://www.google.com/url?q=http://gfs.eiu.com/content/GetFile.ashx%3FRequest%3DFULL&sa=U&ved=0ahUKEwioloX2_d7XAhWhFZoKHTfLC70QFggFMAA&client=internal-uds-cse&cx=013751040265774567329:ylv-hrexwbc&usg=AOvVaw3uoUGX7_5CTHfNrZdI5gps 4. Luigi Di Maio has stated that M5S is willing to take other parties to coalition/have them support M5S, but will not give them any seats at the government. I assume that such a deal is not acceptable to other political parties who thus will be more hesitant to for a coalition with the MS5. Below are scenarios and explanations of my allocations of the percentage points in the way they are: Less than 50\t\t\t\t5%\n\u2022\tWould assume to happen only if there was a major political scandal implicating numerous M5S high level leaders (Di Maio, Grillo). Assuming also that such a scandal have to have to implicate the party leaders in allegations that contradict heavily against what the party has proposed to fight in its platfrom (e.g. large-scale corruption allegations, political collusion)\n\u2022\tAnother scenario would be a possible disintegration of the party into two or more competing parties. Between 50 and 87, inclusive\t\t12%\n\u2022\tScenario 1: A political/personal scandal of one of the major leaders of the party.\n\u2022\tScenario 2: Highflying accendance of popularity of one of the rival larger parties (Democratic Party, People of Freedom, Northern League). This accendance of popularity would have to steal voters from the M5S. Between 88 and 200, inclusive\t\t60%\n\u2022\tAssumption that the party will not form a coalition.\n\u2022\tCurrent popularity (average of polls) of M5S is 28,06% \no\t232 are directly elected in single member districts \u2013 28,06% of it is 108\no\t386 are elected by national proportional representation - 28,06% of it is 65\no\tSum of these 173\n\u2022\tIn 2013 elections 1 percentage point in votes won M5S 4,23 seats at CoD \u2013 if today it would get 28% of the vote it would add 12 seats to M5S \u2013 thus getting 121 seats.\n\u2022\tSum average of these two is  (173+121)/2= 147 Between 201 and 340, inclusive\t\t13%\n\u2022\tScenario 1: Lower numbers of seats in this bracket could be reached when M5S would form a broad coalition with numerous other smaller parties.\n\u2022\tScenario 2: If M5S all vote percentage would be above 45% but it would still come second to another party that would get 46% of the total vote it seems possible that MS5 could barely achieve the 201 treashold.  For me a lot of complicated math, but scenario itself very unlikely :). More than 340\t\t\t\t10%\n\u2022\tScenario 1: In case M5S would get 40% or more votes it would be allocated 54% of the seats in the parliament to have a majority. Throughout the year the polls have shown M5S popularity being between 25% and 32%, dropping slightly in the second half of the year.\n\u2022\tScenario 2: 40% of the total vote could also be achieved by forming coalitions with some of the larger parties.
