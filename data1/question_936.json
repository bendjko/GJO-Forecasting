At the end of April, Lula had said the Workers Party, all on the same week the party released Lula's proposed government program.  Within days, both Lula and Senator Gleisi Hoffmann, who is leading the Workers Party, and who served as chief of staff under Dilma Rousseff, were hit with new corruption charges accusing them of having access to a $40 million slush fund in 2010 funded by Odebrecht in exchange for government decisions that would benefit the company. (As reported by Reuters) Hoffmann says there is no material evidence justifying the charges made against Lula and that he leads the polls by a wide margin with twice the support of his nearest competitor, 6 times the support of any other candidate, and 30 times the support of Guilherme Boulos, who is being referred to \"as the heir apparent for the Brazilian left.\"   The latest is that the Workers Party insists that Lula will run for the Presidency from behind bars if necessary, \"as Bobby Sands did for British Parliament from the Maze penitentiary in 1981.\"  Will he be allowed to? Not likely. Meanwhile, the UN launched a probe into \"the violation of Lula's rights\" this week.    From what it looks like at this point, the Workers Party is fighting it, trying to stick to its guns to run Lula from prison even if to make a statement.  That may be their biggest weapon at the moment to influence public opinion.  They don't seem to have much leverage in the courts.  And if the corruption scandal and accusations continue to mire Lula and the party leaders, (Hoffman and her husband facing charges; Lula's right hand, the former minister, Jos\u00e9 Dirceu, was recently sentenced to 30 years in prison for corruption, found guilty of receiving bribes from Petrobras, the same crime that led to former president Lula) they're fighting not for a victory but for any type of relevance and survival.  If the Workers Party's leaders deem the probabilities of winning the general election in October are that of unlikely victory, they might as well make a stronger statement running Lula in prison. Lula's popularity is not likely to transfer to another candidate the WP runs.  Watching what will happen in the next few weeks as Brazilian authorities will most likely disqualify Lula from being on the ballot.
