Below is my attempt to compile in one post what's happened in the Mirai's U.S. launch, as I see it. Maybe I\u2019ll clean up outstanding typos/cites later, maybe not\u2026 I welcome others\u2019 reactions, particularly since my forecast is way off consensus. Way back in November 2014, Toyota said it would sell the Mirai in two U.S. markets in 2016: California and the Northeast.[01] Later, on 1 October 2015, Toyota projected an allotment of nearly 1,000 cars to the U.S. in 2016.[02] The Mirai officially went on sale in the U.S. on 21 October 2015 and Toyota then claimed \u201cMore than 2,000 people so far have requested to buy a Mirai in California, where it is first available.\u201d[03] By 4 April 2016 it seemed at least possible that Toyota\u2019s partner Air Liquide, would NOT complete hydrogen infrastructure sufficient to fuel the Mirai in the Northeast U.S. until early 2017.[04] Toyota\u2019s undated Mirai FAQ accessed 25 June 2016 says \u201cAt this time a vehicle must be garaged and registered within the state of California. Infrastructure is not yet ready to support sales outside of California, but Toyota will continue to support expansion of fueling stations, beginning with the northeast states in 2016. As infrastructure develops further, we will consider other areas.\u201d[05] Despite the 1,900 Mirai demanded (worldwide?) through 1 October 2015 and then-anticipated allotment of ~1,000 Mirai to the U.S., and the more than 2,000 Mirai demanded by people in California by 21 October 2015, the advance-preorder figure for California given around 23 March 2016 was only 300 Mirai vehicles.[06] Perhaps those would-be customers comprising the difference\u20141,700 Californians who initially wanted the Mirai but were not given an advance preorder\u2014were vetted and deemed poor fits as customers (e.g. because they worked/lived too far from hydrogen infrastructure), or perhaps the 21-Oct. press release was inaccurate. Toyota\\nat.mgr.fuelcellvehicles=Ed La Rocque indicated the number of Mirai deliveries in California at the time of his interview had been limited to 100 by the lack of fueling stations rather than demand. (Perhaps oddly, the number from October 2015 through February 2016 (the last full month of sales at the time of the interview) was actually 128\u2026 but through January it was approximately 100; see data source on which the forecasting problem relies at [07].) There were 12 fueling stations open in California on 1 March 2016,[08] which was earlier in the month that La Rocque indicated the CA advance-preorder figure was 300.[06] As of 25 June 2016, there are 20 commercial fueling stations open in CA, plus six \u201cnon-retail stations\u201d (I assume these are the makeshift stations at dealerships for which \u201cToyota made the decision to station portable hydrogen fueling trailers at six out of the eight approved Toyota dealerships in California where the Mirai is sold, just so that customers could find a place to refuel\u201d[09]). The projected number of stations before year-end varies from about 38 total commercial stations (and 44 total stations if you include non-retail) at the time of posting according to the organization rolling out the stations[10] or if you prefer Toyota on 1 April, 48 total stations[11], or if you prefer Toyota a few days before 11 April, about 40 stations[12] scheduled to open in CA by the end of the year 2016. Some are currently scheduled to open much earlier than year-end, e.g. August. (For detailed projections on when various CA stations are/will be open according to the organization promoting the hydrogen-fueling-station rollout in California, see the continuously updated table at [10].) Note: Toyota said \u201c\u2026in California\u2026 where we introduced Mirai\u2026 it would take only about 68 stations to regularly re-fuel about 10-thousand hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.\u201d[11] There were earthquakes in Japan in April 2016 which took down the Mirai production facility for longer than most other Toyota facilities affected by the quakes[13], which may have negatively affected the May numbers (Toyota is known for just-in-time supply chain; see [14]). Then there were explosions on production lines of a brake supplier to the Mirai-producing facility in May, which could further hamper production for the first half of the year.[24] From October 2015 through May 2016, exactly 250 Mirai were sold in the U.S. [07] (presumably all in CA because it is the only place with fueling infrastructure). We therefore assume most of the 300-vehicle advance-preorder demand for the car in California has been met and Toyota will now need sell to other sources of demand to continue the Mirai\u2019s growth. Toyota and Uber (famously headquartered in San Francisco, an early market for the Mirai and other green cars, and the setting of the proverbial South Park episode \"Smug Alert!\" which features the kids' parents driving a \"Toyonda Pious\" (which looks like a Prius), and enjoying the smell of their own farts out of wine glasses precipitating an environmental crisis of Smug) announced an MOU in late May 2016 that will mean new financing options for Uber drivers: they can lease Mirai directly from Toyota Financial Services [15] (leases count toward this forecasting problem\u2019s resolution); the money for this appears to come from a $1.6-billion green-financing initiative announced by Toyota a week or two earlier.[16] Toyota only offers the Mirai at eight dealerships in California.[05] Toyota has 1,238 [23] dealerships in California, of which [HOW MANY? ALL?] offer the Prius[CITE]. Toyota's eight Mirai dealerships were selected in part because they sold a high volume of hybrid cars.[17] If Toyota sells as many Prius vehicles in California as it did last year (i.e., ~72,000 [18]; Toyota has already sold ~13,200 through March [19])\u2026 so the number of Prius vehicles remaining to be sold this year to hit last year\u2019s target is ~59,000), Toyota would need to sell or lease about 1.1 Mirai for every 100 Prius vehicles sold/(leased?) in California in the back 9 months of the year to positively resolve this forecasting problem. Given Mirai sales through May, each dealership that sells Mirai would need to sell or lease about 10 or 11 Mirai vehicles per month to positively resolve this forecasting problem,[07] if that were the only source of sales (\u2026are there other sources of sales, e.g. do autotrader/dealership cars offered for sale include pre-ordered vehicles? \u2026must a business buy a fleet of Mirai it plans to use as green-cabs through a dealership? I don\u2019t know how it works). There are four dealerships in Northern California and four in Southern California.[05] Toyota told its dealers to hold back deliveries of Mirai until the infrastructure was sufficient to support deliveries so six of eight Mirai dealerships in California were not delivering Mirai as of January 2016. \u201cIt\u2019s not a stop-sale,\u201d [Toyota\\Lentz] said, keen to reiterate that Toyota hasn\u2019t fully halted sales. \u201cWe have just asked [some dealers] not to make deliveries until we have a [nearby] station open.\u201d[20] Given the above factors\u2014apparently there is pent-up demand unable to be satisfied due to inadequacy of hydrogen infrastructure, which is expected to improve throughout 2016, but perhaps not enough to allow enough of a sales push to positively resolve this forecasting problem\u2014I see no reason why Toyota couldn\u2019t more-than-double its Mirai sales in the second half of the year, but also no reason that it\u2019s a sure bet. I expect Toyota is motivated to quickly prove the hydrogen car it named Mirai (Mirai=Future-in-Japanese) is a winner in California in order to out-compete battery-powered electric vehicles (BEVs), which are ahead of hydrogen in California/U.S./earth, but in which Toyota has made little to no investment as far as I can tell, because California is a bellwether for the U.S. clean energy markets and the U.S. is the largest auto market in the world available to a hydrogen vehicle launch. (Presumably it\u2019s too complicated/dicey to try to prove hydrogen infrastructure in China, which is the world\u2019s largest auto market\u2026 regulatory permitting and everything else hydrogen infrastructure entails should be significantly complicated in a socialist \u201cstate\u201d like California but in a protectionist/communist state like China it is likely even more complicated, particularly for a foreign company headquartered in Japan.) I do not believe anything like manufacturing or shipping enough cars to meet demand could be a problem for Toyota; Toyota is the world\u2019s largest [21] and most admired [22] automaker... making and shipping 751 vehicles is a drop in the bucket for it.

Substantive-edit: I suppose demand itself could theoretically be an issue for Toyota... my sources for Mirai-demand are mostly Toyota, which has incentives to report demand optimistically when trying to generate enthusiasm for a new car as here... but insufficient Californian demand for a thousand or so green-vehicles that are a new technology strikes me as unlikely, particularly given the massive investment in infrastructure Toyota's Mirai is requiring.

Toyota loaned us this Mirai, so we didn't have to do all the paperwork. But that's not all. The Mirai is allowed into carpool lanes, and the first three years of hydrogen fuel are complimentary. The Mirai is starting to look a lot more attractive now, isn't it?\nWe're fully aware that it's still early days. After all, the number of publicly available stations has only recently crossed into double-digits, and Mirai sales are strictly limited to buyers who live and work in the areas of California those stations serve.

I've concluded that Toyota's production of the Mirai is considerably less than expected. Let me caveat this by saying that finding sales or registration data for Japan was incredibly frustrating. The sales of the top 30 makes are reported monthly [A1] but I could not find Mirai sales reported anywhere, including Toyota's year end financial statements. The data might lie in a book that I can apparently purchase from JADA. I'm going to reach out to a Japanese friend to see if they can get this for me [A2]. Okay let's look at the Mirai in 2015, the first year of its production. On January 22, 2015, Toyota said on its blog \"The new plan calls for production to increase from 700 units this year to approximately 2,000 in 2016 and around 3,000 in 2017\" [A3].  Where did those 700 Mirai for 2015 go? America received 72 [A4]. The UK got 11 [A5]. Denmark got at least 1 [A6]. After looking at the Toyota site, it seems like every auto show in the world has a Mirai, so let's say there are 10 devoted to promotional things. So that leaves ~600 unaccounted for. Were they all sold to Japan? Not likely. The total estimate for hydrogen cars in Japan as of March 2016 was 400 [A7], another source says 500 as of April 2016 [A8]. Let's add these sales up. From 2015 through April 2016, we can account for (at most) 500 sales in Japan, 210 in the US [A9], and a couple dozen elsewhere (see above). We'd expect around 1250 to have been made during this time period, but we've only found 734. I see two possible explanations for this discrepancy. Option 1: Production is significantly less than expected\nTo review: we've accounted for 734 Mirai (500 Japan, 210 US, 24 elsewhere). That puts production at approximately 59% of projected (linear regression. y = 85.8x - 120, where x is number of months past 1/1/2015). That might not be ridiculous, considering they were initially hand-assembled by a team of 13 highly skilled workers [A10, A11]. The max output per day is still only 10, so it is reasonable to assume that this is still a highly manual process. Option 2: Toyota is holding inventory (purposefully or lack of demand)\nThere is a lack of hydrogen fueling stations [A12]. I don't think demand is a problem, given the interest in \"reserving\" these cars [A13] and a quote from a Toyota executive about wait times [A14]. Would it make sense to hold a bunch of inventory in the US, waiting for the fuel stations to get built? Maybe not, given Japan has 3x the number of stations. Unless Japan is fuel-bound as well, in which case Toyota is holding on to a bunch of cars that everyone wants but no one can fuel. Let's assume we are fuel-bound in the US *and* Japan. Further assume that it's a capacity (rather than location-based) limitation. That implies a limit under 10 cars per station. That just seems way too low. If it isn't, then to sell 750 Mirai this year, California would need to triple the number of hydrogen stations. I think this is unlikely to happen.  Considering these two options, I'd say that this is probably 10% an inventory issue and 90% a production issue. So 734 Mirai + 10% held as inventory account for 800 cars => production is ~35% lower than expected (800/1250).  To summarize so far: through April 2016 we can account for ~800 cars (730 sold, 70 assumed held as inventory). We expected 1250 per Toyota.  Projecting forward, we'd expect an additional 750 cars produced (per Toyota). If the 35% lower production continues, we'll only see an additional .65 * 750 = 487.5 cars produced from now until EOY 2016.
