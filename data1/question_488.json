Again, it can't really stop the Senate from confirming him, but it might give Senate leadership pause in how they want to proceed with this. Also to keep in mind, the Senate has stated they will vote on AHCA before they go on recess (they're last day in session is July 28), and McConnell is likely to use the \"spread offense\" again by scheduling several major items all at the same time to prevent the media and the public from focusing on any one issue. This increases the likelihood that confirmation hearings, Russia hearings, and various votes are scheduled in close proximity or concurrently, forcing the press and the lawmakers themselves to hustle between them. On the other hand, the Senate may want to not draw too much negative attention by forcing through too many party line votes. But in reality, this is probably not a realistic consideration. There are more vulnerable Dems in 2018 than Reps in the Senate, so whatever political blowback may happen is likely to be minor.

The Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 outlines much of the process for \"acting\" agency heads, but here's the skinny on it: -Trump, since it's a transition year, has 300 days (from inauguration) to fill vacancies across the Federal government (essentially until mid-November)\n-For non-transition vacancies (such as the FBI director) the an acting chief can serve for 210 days (Wikipedia states 120 and 150 days, but I can't access the CRS report it references)\n-However, that 210 day clock is essentially postponed indefinitely once a candidate has been nominated, meaning that if the Senate slow-rolls the nomination for several months (a la Merrick Garland), the acting could be in the post well past the 210 mark, especially if the nomination is made close to the deadline\n-If the Senate rejects or returns, or the President withdraws, the nominee, the clock restarts and the acting gets another 210 days\n-Once a second nomination is made, the acting can then remain in post indefinitely while the nominee is being considered\n-Only if the second nominee is rejected, returned, or withdrawn, or if the President fails to make a second nomination with the allotted time, is the position required to go vacant https://www.gsa.gov/graphics/admin/Vacancies_Reform_Act1998.pdf\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Vacancies_Reform_Act_of_1998 However, it's unclear what the consequences of allowing the position to go vacant are, beyond the fact that anyone in an acting capacity is no longer able to take any legally binding action. So if the FBI director position is vacated by not meeting the timeline, McCabe no longer has any ability to take enforceable action. Which seems like it might actually be a boon to Trump, as it would effectively hamstring the FBI's investigation as certain decisions are required from the director.  This would seem like it would come at great political cost, but in today's environment, it might be the most political savvy move to leave the position vacant by either failing to meet the deadlines or nominating politically repugnant candidates, thus further entangling the investigation into partisan politics. The opportunity cost for Trump in that case, however, would be that he'll have to stage more photo shoots for letter signings to appease his base's call for action, as such decision would likely engulf the Senate in the process.

Moreover, a nomination before June 23 will have a high change of passing before August 1.  Other factors to consider: (i) a truly independent and professional candidate can be confirmed faster than 29 days; (ii) a candidate know mainly for his personal loyalty to Trump may not be passed at all.

But why rush? He can wait and hold that card. In the meantime, he can replace the acting Director McCabe, whom he mistrusts with his own acting director who may be able to serve indefinitely. This may make sense to Trump--subject to great pressure from the FBI under McCabe, as well as Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Pressure is increasing and I expect Trump to go all out to protect himself.

The first choice declined, which raises suspicion in my mind that loyalty was requested yet again.   Obama's previous appointment of Comey took approximately 5 1/2 weeks (June 21 to July 29) to be approved after nomination.  Comey was widely respected by both sides of the aisle and went through the process fairly quickly.  It is unlikely that any new nominee will make it out faster.  If nominated today, that would put the approval date around July 5.  Thus, the possibility of approval before July is nearly impossible at this moment. Ben Sasse, Susan Collins, McCaine, Rand Paul (ish), Rob Portman, Lindsay Graham and Jeff Flake have voiced concerns about the Trump presidency. Susan Collins, Rand Paul, Mitch McConnel, Jeff Flake, and Lindsay Graham have a history of going against party lines without fear (in a ranking, they are all in the top ten).  Thus, if Trump puts up an obviously biased candidate that will not properly deal with the Russia investigation, there are 5 or 6 Republicans that have the fortitude to go against party lines for purposes of Conscience.   If Trump does not submit a nominee prior to June 22, then it is near to a 100% likelihood of not being approved before August.  If he gets one in before then, it will depend on the nominee.  He has shown the forethought to put up a bipartisan candidate, due to his consideration (misguided or not) of Joe Leiberman.  If he puts up this type of candidate, then the likelihood is much higher.  However, all other candidates known publicly, are more likely to drop or obstruct the Russia investigation (not necessarily likely, but more likely given party affiliation).   The president is able to appoint an acting director without senate approval, so if there is something legitimate to the Russia investigation, it would be in his favor to appoint someone who will drop the investigation or to prolong his search and keep the acting director in.

He has testified that working under Comey was the \u201chonor\u201d of his career and that the FBI\u2019s Russia inquiry will continue. Also, the Justice Department\u2019s Office of the Inspector General is reviewing whether he should have recused himself from the bureau\u2019s investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server because his wife had received donations to her state Senate campaign from groups with ties to Clinton. Senator Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, has been vocal about that issue. The FBI has said that McCabe did not participate in fundraising events for his wife\u2019s campaign and that he did not play a role overseeing the Clinton emails investigation until after his wife\u2019s campaign was finished.

Some think that the same rule would preclude Robert Mueller, the special counsel overseeing the FBI\u2019s investigation into Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election, from investigating three of his former firm\u2019s clients: Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner and former Trump Campaign Manager Paul Manafort. But a spokesman for the firm has said Mueller had no involvement with those three clients, and the Justice Department has said its ethics experts had determined his \u201cparticipation in the matters assigned to him is appropriate.\u201d Since 1972, the Senate has confirmed seven FBI director nominations, and presidents have withdrawn two nominations, in 1973 and 1977, according to a 2014 report by the Congressional Research Service.

She has a breadth of experience involving national-security issues, the former agent said, and that a woman would \"be the smart pick\" for Trump to nominate to the post.\" Frances Townsend: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Townsend\nTownsend began her prosecutorial career in 1985, serving as an Assistant District Attorney in Brooklyn, New York. She gained the support and mentorship of federal prosecutors Rudolph Giuliani and Louis Freeh. In 1988, she was hired by Giuliani for the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York where she worked on white-collar crime. Townsend also ran the office's organized crime unit, where she conducted one-on-one interviews with members of the Gambino crime family.\nTownsend moved to the Justice Department in the early 1990s to work on international legal matters. In 1991, she worked in the Office of the Attorney General to assist in establishing the newly created Office of International Programs, the predecessor to the Executive Office for National Security. In December 1993, she joined the Criminal Division where she served as Chief of Staff to the Assistant Attorney General, where she took part in establishing the Division's international training and rule of law programs.\nDuring the Clinton administration, Townsend served in a series of positions at the Justice Department, eventually working as intelligence policy counsel for Attorney General Janet Reno. She served as Director of the Office of International Affairs in the Criminal Division from November 1995 until November 1997, when she was appointed Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General. Townsend was appointed Counsel for Intelligence Policy in March 1998, heading the office of Intelligence Policy and Review, whose various functions included approving intelligence-gathering activities related to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Townsend managed the Justice Department's Office of Intelligence Policy and Review until 2001. She was one of Reno's key advisers, acting as a \"back channel\" between the attorney general and FBI Special Agent John P. O'Neill, who was also her friend. The incoming Bush administration did not opt to keep Townsend on. Instead, she served as Assistant Commandant for Intelligence for the United States Coast Guard. While she was on maternity leave during the September 11 attacks in 2001, Townsend assisted the Coast Guard in updating intelligence legislation to switch the branch's priority from drug smuggling to the vulnerability of U.S. ports.\nDespite worries about Townsend's past as a Democratic appointee, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice hired her for the National Security Council in Spring 2003 at the urging of counterterrorism chief John A. Gordon and Homeland Security Advisor Richard A. Clarke. In December 2003, she coordinated government terrorism responses that led to the grounding of flights from Europe during the holiday season. She was appointed Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism on May 28, 2004. During her tenure, she oversaw an intelligence reorganization and conducted the first post-9/11 review of the White House's anti-terrorism campaign. Townsend served as the public face of the Bush administration while it was under criticism for allegedly overreacting to dated intelligence in its decision to raise terrorist threat levels during an election season. She also inspected Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison as an envoy of President Bush. Townsend was tapped to implement broad changes in the intelligence community recommended by a presidential commission headed by former Senator Chuck Robb and U.S. District Judge Laurence Silberman.\nTownsend then served in the United States Department of Justice, including a stint as Counsel to the Attorney General for Intelligence Policy in the George W. Bush administration. In May 2007, she was appointed \"National Continuity Coordinator\" under the auspices of National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD) 51.\nAs of this date, Townsend serves as an Advisory Board member for the Partnership for a Secure America. Other memberships include the Council on Foreign Relations and the Leadership Council for Concordia. Frances Fragos married lawyer John Michael Townsend on October 8, 1994 in an Episcopal ceremony at Manhattan's Church of the Incarnation. As of 2006, they have two children, both sons. With a self-professed \"triple type-A\" personality, Townsend has been described as having a characteristic bluntness and a \"sometimes salty, streetwise style\" that once led her coworkers to nickname her \"The Hurricane\". \nSource: Wikipedia Related:\n\"Section 702\"\nFISA 702: http://intelligence.house.gov/fisa-702/\nSection 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act authorizes the Intelligence Community to target the communications of non-U.S. persons located outside the United States for foreign intelligence purposes.

Some qualified candidates may not want to be considered because of the turmoil surrounding the investigations on the Trump admin re Russia (several have already withdrawn their names).  Other candidates may need to be carefully vetted (Lieberman was head counsel at Trump's main law firms, Kasowitz, Benson, Torres & Friedman, a firm that is in turn counsel for Russian interests).  \nOne would imagine this nomination is top priority for the Trump admin and that it will be resolved soon but it involves many challenges, and, so far, the Trump admin is yet to show that it's mastering how to work government and its many systems.

Who he nominates will determine how long the confirmation process is. More contentious candidates will likely slow the process, while universally acclaimed candidates will likely go through quicker. Trump's candidates are averaging 25 days between nomination and confirmation (https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/how-long-confirmations-will-take/), which would put this at the end of June assuming an announcement by 31 May. However, the WH has taken the approach of announcing the candidate, and then completing the necessary vetting. If they follow this approach again, they run the risk of being blindsided by a controversial issue of the candidate or by the candidate's inability to divest of conflicts. Another factor to keep in mind is that the Senate will take off the entire week following Memorial Day, returning to session on 3 June. It is likely, given the toxicity of the AHCA, that the Senate will prioritize confirmation hearings and votes for the FBI director over writing their version of health care reform. However, just because it receives priority doesn't mean it will sail through. The Russia scandal and the assignment of a special prosecutor will likely force Republicans to yield to Democrats' demands of thoroughly vetting the nominee, which could slow down the committee hearings. Once out of committee, the Republicans will likely have to negotiate with the Democrats to ensure some level of bipartisan support to counter the narrative of the new director being a puppet for the party and WH. The confirmation along party lines of a controversial director could result in significant fallout for the Republican party in 2018, especially if it comes across as a means of squashing the investigation. And while the filibuster has been removed for filling vacancies in the administration, the Democrats can threaten a government shutdown in October if they believe the Republicans are not being transparent. (And no, the Dems will not likely suffer for it, much as Reps didn't suffer long term for the 2013 shutdown). For these reasons, I think it will be close to the 1 July date, and favor afterwards more than before. The timing of the announcement and the vetting process will shift the probabilities. After 1 August is not likely, as Congress is on recess for all of August, and will then have to negotiate an FY18 budget (or more likely a CR) in the 3 weeks they have in session in September.
