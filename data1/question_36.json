conviction at all costs; they also have high power in terms of connections, resources and more Syed and his defense: Objective: Overturn the conviction as soon as possible and bring light to the faults of the justice system, in this case especially; Power: Medium; Although Syed hasn't had success in past motions, with the overwhelming support of the public as a result of Serial, and emergence of significant new evidence to use to petition for a retrial, Syed and his defense have the most power now that they have had yet Public/Syed Supporters/Serial Podcast Listeners: Objective: Secure a fair trial for Syed, and bring light to the failings of the justice system in this case and otherwise; Power: Medium; The public doesn't have the same resources, from a legal or institutional perspective, as the prosecution, but they have acted essentially as thousands of investigators in the case; they have also brought the case a ton of publicity, particularly when it comes to the potential failings of the prosecution The power is fairly evenly distributed here between anti-Syed and pro-Syed parties, which means that although power of the players is worth keeping an eye on, it doesn\u2019t affect the forecast significantly as of now.

If he rules yes on the retrial, the process of preparing for and executing a trial that is so 1) public 2) heavily based on reanalyzing old evidence and 3) wrought with potential legal issues for the Baltimore Police Dept and beyond, will be long and arduous.  Average length of pre-trial motions, trial, and pre-sentencing procedures for felony cases is 4 months - 3 years; even if this case falls in the low-middle end of this range, the outcome of a trial wouldn\u2019t happen until past the end of 2016. Select the right amount of effort per question:  This question isn\u2019t even \u201cin play\u201d until the motion for retrial is granted, which isn\u2019t even for sure yet.

I wish I were sure that the GJedi understood this; I worry that they think his conviction is not overturned unless he is found Not Guilty.  \"New evidence\" is not as such grounds for overturning a verdict, as appeals can only be taken on procedural defects at trial.  Actual innocence is not in itself grounds--do recall that the late Justice Scalia upheld the right of states to execute people whose innocence was not in doubt, as long as there were no defects in the trial that convicted them.

It must be lower\u2013 much lower. I'm sure that half is too high, but for this purpose let's call it half, which means a base rate of 2%. There are a number of factors which I think reduce this rate in the Syed case. According to the Innocence Project (IP), the leading contributing factor (63%) for homicide case exonerations is false confession. This was not a factor in the Syed case.  IP lists other important factors as DNA evidence, eyewitness misidentification testimony, unvalidated or improper forensic science, and informants. The only one of these that could apply in this case is informant issues (with Jay being Jay) but this is not the basis for the appeal. In addition, successful appeals often have the support of the prosecution/police and that is not the case here. The prosecution strongly opposes, and the judge hearing the appeal is the same judge who denied the first post-conviction appeal. I think all of the above reduces the chances of exoneration to near zero.\nSources: http://www.innocenceproject.org/free-innocent/improve-the-law/fact-sheets/dna-exonerations-nationwide ; http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bs-md-syed-state-response-20150923-story.html ; http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/shortcuts/2015/sep/06/serial-podcast-what-happened-adnan-syeds-case But there are some factors that increase the probability. For one, I listened to the Serial podcast and have read some of the court transcripts, and I think the initial case was thin and I'm surprised he was convicted to begin with. Also, the IP is involved in the case, which I think has a positive impact on the probability of success. Finally, the large amount of publicity in the case must have a positive impact. I think that given these factors, 0% is too low, but I think it would be a mistake to go any higher than 1% unless additional information comes to light.

I saw the ATF and DEA take down guys in my neighborhood for selling much less than I was at the time. And they were getting sentenced to three and five years.
