I got burned last time I did this (on the hacking question).  According to Tedlock, this is the value of forecasts by the crowd.  My individual score doesn't matter as much as the recording of a dissenting view (with some rationale for a post-mortem thus an opportunity to learn). What could throw this forecast completely off is who Trump chooses as Yellen's replacement as Fed Reserve Chair and when.  That decision will come sometime this week.  Trump has generally talked down the dollar.  However, there is much opportunity if the dollar surges up then falls.  I'm betting that the announcement comes after Oct. 31.\nhttps://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/trump-set-to-name-jerome-powell-as-favourite-to-chair-us-federal-reserve-bdn65hgkj\nhttp://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2017/10/29/Trump-unlikely-to-name-top-two-Federal-Reserve-officials-at-same-time-Steven-Mnuchin-says/stories/201710290192\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/if-trump-wants-to-spring-a-fed-surprise-hes-set-market-up-nicely-for-a-yellen-bump-2017-10-27"], [28414, "2017-10-30T11:22:05Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [11080, "2017-10-30T10:10:16Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.71, 0.29, 0.0], ""], [32872, "2017-10-30T09:31:02Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.92, 0.08, 0.0], ""], [30074, "2017-10-30T06:47:44Z", [0.0, 0.2, 0.61, 0.19, 0.0], ""], [29145, "2017-10-30T05:42:24Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [427, "2017-10-30T05:04:47Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.7, 0.2, 0.0], ""], [19801, "2017-10-30T04:34:11Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.85, 0.14, 0.0], ""], [6303, "2017-10-30T04:16:20Z", [0.0, 0.02, 0.95, 0.03, 0.0], "Based on general news and GJP consensus."], [5018, "2017-10-29T19:21:55Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [36505, "2017-10-29T18:56:52Z", [0.0, 0.02, 0.78, 0.19, 0.01], ""], [368, "2017-10-29T17:36:50Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [11057, "2017-10-29T16:37:31Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.94, 0.06], ""], [14432, "2017-10-29T15:46:05Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.6, 0.4, 0.0], ""], [23409, "2017-10-29T15:07:40Z", [0.0, 0.16, 0.36, 0.36, 0.12], ""], [37368, "2017-10-29T13:12:48Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.73, 0.27, 0.0], ""], [691, "2017-10-29T12:25:52Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.41, 0.59, 0.0], ""], [368, "2017-10-29T01:40:48Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2017-10-28T22:09:31Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.21, 0.77, 0.02], ""], [11057, "2017-10-28T14:55:17Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.86, 0.14], ""], [37368, "2017-10-28T13:26:38Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.71, 0.29, 0.0], ""], [38616, "2017-10-28T07:40:40Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.8, 0.14, 0.01], "Update to reflect recent weakening."], [21884, "2017-10-28T07:17:25Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.3, 0.7, 0.0], "3.23"], [29646, "2017-10-28T05:40:55Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.48, 0.52, 0.0], ""], [35302, "2017-10-28T04:55:57Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.28, 0.72, 0.0], ""], [11080, "2017-10-28T03:11:52Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.68, 0.32, 0.0], ""], [14266, "2017-10-28T02:23:47Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.33, 0.66, 0.01], ""], [601, "2017-10-27T23:59:04Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.75, 0.0], ""], [83, "2017-10-27T20:46:31Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.8, 0.0], ""], [36505, "2017-10-27T20:24:19Z", [0.0, 0.02, 0.86, 0.11, 0.01], ""], [368, "2017-10-27T20:19:38Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [36505, "2017-10-27T18:10:23Z", [0.0, 0.02, 0.76, 0.2, 0.02], ""], [25141, "2017-10-27T15:22:55Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [11057, "2017-10-27T14:28:33Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.81, 0.19], ""], [35302, "2017-10-27T14:23:18Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.99, 0.01], ""], [37368, "2017-10-27T13:48:01Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.71, 0.24, 0.0], ""], [691, "2017-10-27T12:38:53Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.21, 0.77, 0.02], ""], [35302, "2017-10-27T12:14:31Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.92, 0.08], ""], [36505, "2017-10-27T12:06:57Z", [0.0, 0.02, 0.55, 0.35, 0.08], ""], [36505, "2017-10-27T09:16:53Z", [0.0, 0.02, 0.4, 0.46, 0.12], ""], [21884, "2017-10-27T07:47:18Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.04, 0.95, 0.01], ""], [25141, "2017-10-27T07:09:38Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.9, 0.1], ""], [35302, "2017-10-27T04:29:52Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.94, 0.05], "Just a word of warning to anyone checking the exchange rate in the link provided (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DEXBZUS), it is not updated on a daily basis.
