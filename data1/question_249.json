Fivethirtyeight gives Clinton an 88% chance of winning based on Polls only, 83.9% on polls plus. Went for Obama by substantial margins twice. Tim Kaine is sitting senator from Virginia and former governor. Trump seems to be backing off some of his more outlandish and incendiary statements and policies under new leadership, which may help his chances. However, the damage is most likely done. I put the chances as higher than fivethirtyeights polls plus, which is based on economic and historical data. I think this slightly underestimates Clinton's chances based on the unprecedented campaign and likability polling of Donald Trump and a possible shift in colors based on current polling and the election margins of Obama, despite George W. Bush receiving well over 50% of the vote in both of his elections. Also, Tim Kaine's selection as VP will help here above what is projected in the polls plus forecast. I put Clinton's chances slightly below current polling because of Trump's recent campaign shakeup and recent backtracking on statements that demonstrate a possible shift in tone of his campaign."], [10267, "2016-08-21T04:27:39Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [532, "2016-08-20T20:54:31Z", [0.95, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [5863, "2016-08-20T19:24:36Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [368, "2016-08-20T18:40:33Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [15548, "2016-08-20T15:21:32Z", [0.88, 0.12, 0.0], ""], [1708, "2016-08-20T14:59:59Z", [0.85, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [691, "2016-08-20T12:48:55Z", [0.94, 0.06, 0.0], ""], [10267, "2016-08-20T04:34:18Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2016-08-19T18:39:11Z", [0.92, 0.08, 0.0], ""], [6862, "2016-08-19T18:23:44Z", [0.8, 0.2, 0.0], ""], [746, "2016-08-19T18:18:32Z", [0.65, 0.35, 0.0], ""], [368, "2016-08-19T17:48:34Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [28415, "2016-08-19T17:35:38Z", [0.91, 0.09, 0.0], ""], [12518, "2016-08-19T16:13:41Z", [0.92, 0.08, 0.0], ""], [13998, "2016-08-19T15:11:06Z", [0.96, 0.04, 0.0], "Clinton win \n88.9% http://predictwise.com/politics/2016-president-winner\n91% http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/virginia/\n90% GJ current"], [12879, "2016-08-19T14:57:30Z", [0.9, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [12134, "2016-08-19T14:54:15Z", [0.85, 0.1, 0.05], "Trump in a hole he can't emerge from"], [10039, "2016-08-19T14:11:06Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1207, "2016-08-19T13:17:53Z", [0.85, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [10657, "2016-08-19T08:47:35Z", [0.45, 0.55, 0.0], ""], [10267, "2016-08-19T04:30:59Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [21046, "2016-08-19T03:15:51Z", [0.95, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [13055, "2016-08-19T02:28:22Z", [0.99, 0.01, 0.0], ""], [27207, "2016-08-19T02:17:31Z", [0.43, 0.57, 0.0], "The last statewide elections were close in spite of predictions of easy Democratic wins.
