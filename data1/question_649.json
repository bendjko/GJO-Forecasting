That link isn\u2019t working for me at the moment, but I can see the following information from the page: \u201cMore than 330 WWII monuments to Red Army vanished in Poland in last 20 years, envoy says...Twenty years ago, more than 560 World War II monuments to the Red Army were located on Poland's territory outside burial...\u201d Assuming that number is accurate, that\u2019s 1.37 monuments removed per month. I can\u2019t find good background information regarding the timing of those removals, but I think it\u2019s as safe to assume that they came down in batches as it is to assume that they came down at a steady rate. Still, in lieu of better information, this is the best baseline we seem to have.\nIn terms of more recent (and documented) cases: At least one \u201cSoviet monument was removed from the town of Pieniezno\u201d in 2015  and a mausoleum in Trzcianka was knocked down in September 2017 , despite the protests of the Russian MFA. In the case of Pieniezno, Russia threatened Poland with \u201cmost serious consequences.\u201d  The city went ahead with the removal anyway. So we know that removals have happened recently and that they\u2019ve happened over the strenuous objection of the Russians. Cities and provinces weren\u2019t waiting for federal legislation to pull down monuments. But was that the low-hanging fruit, perhaps? Are many of the remaining monuments in more pro-Russia areas? It doesn\u2019t seem that we have the data to really make that determination, unfortunately. There are around 500 standing  and about half that number have been targeted for removal by this order .\nPer the RFE story footnoted below, \u201cA 2007 poll\u2026showed around 57 percent of respondents were against the removal of Soviet monuments. But Polish attitudes toward Moscow have hardened significantly since Russia's 2014 annexation of\u2026the Crimean Peninsula.\u201d This information is only slightly useful. Ideally, we\u2019d have more recent results, with some sense of the geographic distribution of anti-Soviet monument sentiment.\nThe articles footnoted below say \u201cit is up to city councils whether they want them (the monuments) cleared, but an official in Warsaw\u2019s city council said that while they had no plans to remove their (in Warsaw) Soviet monuments, the provincial authorities, which are more closely aligned to Poland\u2019s governing party, can overrule their decision.\u201d Multiple layers of red tape make it tougher to know what to make of strong sentiments from any one policymaker.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that at least one demolition took eight months  from decision to removal, so while it\u2019s not clear that we\u2019d have any warning that a municipality had made a decision to remove, it seems to me that the Russians would be crowing about it well in advance. Perhaps this long lead time is a one off, I can\u2019t be sure without a better archive.\nIn summary: There are a lot of question marks here. I can only find recent news coverage of about one removal per year, but that\u2019s well off the historic average. I think it\u2019s safe to assume for these purposes that the law was passed with the intention of spurring more removals, though it could have been a primarily symbolic gesture. Given the lack of clarity around the issue, I\u2019m starting in the 40-60 range and adjusting down incrementally until the end of the prediction period. Given there are no current (English-language) stories about impending removals, and that previous removals have taken quite some time to come to completion, I\u2019ll start at 40% and adjust downward. There are 57 days to resolution, so I\u2019ll take a percentage point off every day between now and then and keep an eye on the headlines, adjusting upwards if there are rumblings of a specific removal.

The troops are part of Washington's latest effort to bolster allied nation's against what they perceive to be a military threat from neighboring Russia. Moscow, however, has accused the U.S. and its NATO allies of undermining Russia's own security by surrounding it with hostile forces.\nVladimir Shamanov, head of the defense committee for Russia's lower house of parliament, said the country would consider adding more nuclear-capable Iskander ballistic missiles on its side of the border to deter a U.S. military buildup in the region.\" Reuters, September 29, 'Russia left troops in Belarus after wargames: Ukraine': https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-army/russia-left-troops-in-belarus-after-wargames-ukraine-idUSKCN1C4234 Polish Culture: \nWhy uneasy relations exist between Poles and Russians: http://culture.polishsite.us/articles/art212fr.htm\n\"European neighbors Poland and Russia have both a shared, and a strained, history together. Both nations are Slavic, they speak similar languages, and have lived in relatively the same way throughout history. Over various periods of history, both Poland and Russia have conquered each other's territory. Despite all the similarities, however, there are sharp contrasts. Poles are Roman Catholics, and therefore use the Latin alphabet in their script, as well as being a very Western-oriented country; Russians are of the Orthodox religion, which has a centuries-long hatred of Roman Catholicism, and therefore write using the Cyrillic alphabet. In addition, Russia is oriented towards the East, towards Byzantine for its religious history, and the hordes of Mongolia for its political history. The centuries of conquering each other, as well as totally opposite ways of thinking, have left a long mark of distrust between the peoples of these two countries.\" Comments: Date to watch\nNovember 11, National Independence Day (Poland): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Independence_Day_(Poland)\nNational Independence Day (Polish: Narodowe \u015awi\u0119to Niepodleg\u0142o\u015bci) is a national day in Poland celebrated on 11 November to commemorate the anniversary of the restoration of Poland's sovereignty as the Second Polish Republic in 1918, after 123 years of partition by the Russian Empire, the Kingdom of Prussia and the Habsburg Empire. It is a non-working day in Poland.\nSource: Wikipedia Polish-Soviet War: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish%E2%80%93Soviet_War\nControversies of the Polish\u2013Soviet War: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversies_of_the_Polish%E2%80%93Soviet_War\nClips from Controversies article:\n\"The Polish side claimed that during the Soviet retreat from Berdychiv, Kiev and Zhytomyr mass hostage-taking of civilians occurred, with hostages forced to go with the Red Army all the way to the rear of the front. Similar claims were made that when returning to Berdychiv the Bolsheviks threw out the sick and wounded from the hospital \"disregarding the lives and honor of the medical personnel\" and that in general the Soviet advance into Ukraine was characterized by mass killing of civilians and the burning of entire villages, especially by Budyonny's cossacks, designed to terrorise the Ukrainian population.\nIn January 1918 in Cichinicze near Mohylow Bolsheviks shot patients and personnel of a Polish hospital.\nBehind Polish lines, Soviet forces hanged suspected enemies on the spot. Ultimately, in the pacification of Ukraine that began during the Soviet counteroffensive in 1920 and which would not end until 1922, the Soviets would take tens of thousands of Ukrainian lives. On 7 June, the same day Budyonny's Cossacks, spreading terror in the rear of recently broken Polish frontlines, burned a hospital in Berdychiv, with 600 patients and International Red Cross nuns inside.\nThere were also accusations against Stanis\u0142aw Bu\u0142ak-Ba\u0142achowicz, a former officer of the Imperial Russian and Bolsheviks armies, who switched sides in the conflict and became a general in Poland. Although Bu\u0142ak-Ba\u0142achowicz was regarded as a national hero to Belarusians in Poland for protecting them against Bolshevik terror, and his refusal to kill peasants on orders from Soviets, he is said to have behaved like an absolute ruler in the territories controlled by his troops, even conducting public executions. As one Polish officer wrote in a letter to his wife: \"This is a person without ideology. The bandit and the murderer and his comrades \u2013 subordinates are just like that. They know no shame and are similar to barbarians... I witnessed throwing the cut-off heads of Bolsheviks under his feet... The massacre of Bolsheviks was horrific\".\nSource: Wikipedia Katyn Massacre:\nCIA Library, The Katyn Controversy: Stalin's Killing Field: https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/winter99-00/art6.html\n"], [23080, "2017-10-20T19:45:20Z", [0.0], ""], [1191, "2017-10-20T19:27:04Z", [0.8], "I lack evidence that Poland will not follow through in accordance with the government's announced intention by year-end 2017."], [134, "2017-10-20T19:15:24Z", [0.65], ""], [16272, "2017-10-20T17:37:39Z", [0.75], ""], [6600, "2017-10-20T16:19:04Z", [0.35], ""], [691, "2017-10-20T16:16:19Z", [0.5], ""], [28414, "2017-10-20T14:47:59Z", [1.0], ""], [28414, "2017-10-20T12:37:57Z", [0.95], ""], [28414, "2017-10-20T12:31:31Z", [0.5], ""], [28414, "2017-10-20T12:04:03Z", [1.0], ""], [19801, "2017-10-20T05:37:54Z", [1.0], ""], [37474, "2017-10-20T03:49:48Z", [0.9], ""], [37474, "2017-10-20T03:38:06Z", [0.9], ""], [40847, "2017-10-19T19:33:30Z", [0.8], ""], [1333, "2017-10-19T18:05:42Z", [0.45], ""], [40720, "2017-10-19T17:19:42Z", [0.15], ""], [15548, "2017-10-19T17:16:58Z", [0.5], ""], [598, "2017-10-19T14:17:48Z", [0.5], ""], [31450, "2017-10-19T14:11:00Z", [0.65], "Given the anti-Russia attitude of the current government and recent legislation in the country, I think we will see statues and monuments coming down this year."], [25713, "2017-10-19T13:28:02Z", [0.75], "I wasn't sure what type of santions Russia (\"RU\") could actually impose on Poland (\"PL\")... Economically, RU and PL do share imports and exports.  Looks like 4% of PL imports are from RU and 12% of PL exports are to RU [1].  Conversely, PL accounts for about 7% of RU exports and <3% of RU imports [2]. Which leads me to believe that RU would focus on exports from PL to RU (to maximize impact on PL and min impact on RU). 50% of exports from PL to RU are from \"Machinery\" and \"Electronic Equiptment\"; which RU also gets from a number of countries [3].  I'm taking a bit of a leap, but going to assume that RU can absorb sanctions in this area.  All things being equal, PL would then see up to a 6% drop in exports (e.g. 50% hit on 12% of PL exports to RU).  Not insignificant & its not clear if PL could make up that drop by selling more to other trading partners.  While machinery and transport equiptment make up 38% of their exports already [4], I'm not sure they could sell more to existing trading partners or grow new trading partners quickly. That all said - mix in some anti-RU sentiment in PL already (vandalizing of soviet monuments past few years; even some cemetery/grave stones of soviet soldiers from WWII) and perhaps the politics outway the economics for PL in this case.  The law itself gives local officials / landowners one year (from July '17) to take down monumnets [5][6]; so Dec would mark the 6 month point. I'm going to bet that of the 200+ monuments in question, at least one will be brought down by Dec.
