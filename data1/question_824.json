First, the US government and indeed US based NGOs or interest groups generally, are so involved in domestic problems that it is unlikely that any African country will be the subject of any consideration during 2018.  Secondly, the African Union and European Union will therefore be the major players.  Paul Kagame of Rwanda is the 2018 chairman of the AU Assembly and he is a man who would like to earn respect from his fellow African leaders.  The Kenyans and Ethiopians would no doubt prefer to slow the tide of refugees.   The EU has the same motivation.  At the same time, if we look at other states in the region with endemic civil war (Congo for example), it appears that lack of central government control and severe drought have led the FEWS to predict famine at level 5 through May in parts of the country.  The COH from December is not holding and conditions on the ground appear to be highly unstable.  The real question here is will a systematic, fatal attack on 1,000 civilians be made.  I have little doubt that many more than that will die of famine in this time period.  FEWS suggests that only sustained humanitarian aid will prevent that from happening.  My yes may be too strong because I have worked a bit with refugees from South Sudan and they have expressed profound fear of ongoing violence.  Even the local Kenyans have withdrawn back from the SS border because their cattle have been stolen and they are starving.

In spite of increasing international pressure in the form of more sanctions and tightening arms embargoes, the conflict does not appear to be moving toward resolution.  There are still widespread food shortages causing severe hunger in the majority of the population.  Most armed groups are using this food insecurity as leverage and a weapon in itself.  Additionally, the factions among the belligerent groups continue to shift making peaceful resolution less likely. Given the high likelihood that conditions (economic and political) will deteriorate in 2018, there is little reason to hope that this year will see a resolution or calming of the conflict.
