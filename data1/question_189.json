Government authorities have sought to silence dissent with threats, violence, and arbitrary arrests. In eastern Congo, dozens of armed groups remain active. Many of their commanders lead forces that have been responsible for numerous war crimes for which few have been held accountable.

In 2015, joined the opposition G7 group which split from Kabila's ruling party. The group advocates \"free, fair, open elections\", the objective seems to be to replace Kabila. The DRc's Justice Minister has reportedly issued an arrest warrant and launched an investigation into  Katumbi's alleged use of mercenaries to recruit Congolese youth into a militia.
