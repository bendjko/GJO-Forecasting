To move below 13% would mean a change of over 0.32%, which represents an ~8% change for Apple (the largest) or 17% for Facebook (the smallest). None of the companies have their next earnings announcements before the markets close on 1/31, so I think it's highly unlikely that their valuation will move enough to move the total holdings to a different band.
