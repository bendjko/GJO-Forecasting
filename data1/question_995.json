Moreover, if we look at the past couple years around this time, we do not see extreme fluctuations of the spot exchange rate (2017 saw the spot exchange rate hover around 3.85 for November).

The spot exchange rate currently is 5.5013 (accurate as of 13 November 10:20).  In a five year span, the spot exchange rate has only fluctuated equal to or greater than a half a percentage point within a month span in July-August 2018. The spot exchange rate in a five year span has stabilized in November of each year, with the exception of 2016, fluctuating no more than 0.33 points. We can expect that the spot exchange rate will stabilize in November 2018, as it has historically done the last few years, including the first half of November 2018 as it has only fluctuated 0.03 points. Lastly, the spot exchange rate has remained between 5.00 and 6.00 since early October 2018.

Interestingly, however, the PPI (producer price index) has gone up even more significantly (twice as much as the CPI on an year-on-year basis) [1]. The PPI usually front-runs the CPI (because businesses eventually pass through cost increases on consumers) so these numbers suggest the CPI is probably going to get worse in the coming months. This would further cramp the ability of consumers to repay loans, put upward pressure on interest rates, and further alienate investors (leading to lower demand for the lira). Much of this is probably already priced in. Further, the IMF [2] suggests Turkey's troubles are far from over with next year GDP numbers slashed to what is essentially projected to be a stagnation.  Technical traders are probably going to look at the 50 day moving average (around 6) and see it as a price support. I wouldn't be surprised if algorithm traders have set this level as an automatic buy zone for the USD/TRY exchange rate (suggesting lower likelihood of the exchange rate being below 6, i.e. a lower likelihood of the lira strengthening).

Historically, Turkey has received significant foreign investment which seems to be reversing, resulting in high capital outflows from the country (from the Wikipedia article and associated links https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_currency_and_debt_crisis,_2018#cite_note-18, https://ahvalnews.com/turkey-economy/turkish-current-account-gap-widens-portfolio-inflows-slump). These outflows involve people selling Turkish investments and Turkish Lira to convert their money back to their domestic currency (USD, EUR etc), the selling reduces the value of the Lira. The Government can make the currency more attractive for investors by increasing the interest rates which is the typical path to offset capital outflows and declining currency values. However, Erdo\u011fan seems firmly (and strangely) against raising interest rates (Erdo\u011fan has significant power over the Turkish Central Bank's monetary policy) which suggest that the outflows will be offset by a decline in Lira .  There seems to be a sort of negative feedback loop in that financial institutions make up a significant portion of the Turkish stock market. Capital outflows result in less funds available for borrowing which means that Turkish business that have borrowed find it harder to repay debt. Higher debt defaults lead to poorer performance from the finance sector of the stockmarket which probably results in more capital withdrawals from the country.  Also, the USD seems to be performing well against a trade weighted index, plus outlook is for USD interest rate increases, putting more pressure on the Lira USD.

The average is equal to a 0.8% change increase in the price. Results:\n<5: 1%\n5-6:  3%\n6-7: 8%\n>7: 88% This is a far from perfect model as it uses limited data (+ the fact that currency crises probably do not conform to normal distributions). However, what I draw from this is the following: if we assume that the situation continues to unravel the way it has, it is very difficult to justify a forecast below 6. To do so, we'd have to believe that the Turkish government will take steps to alleviate the problems. As I've written before (https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/766955), raising rates seems unlikely and fiscal measures will probably be limited. There is a chance, however, that the tensions with the U.S. will ease, which would be bullish for the lira. That is why I raise the percentage for <6 from the Monte Carlo results.  Second, model results can be useful when they show you something that surprises you. In this case, the chance of >7 seems surprisingly high. This is to a large extent due to the fact that the model does not capture any kind of balancing feedbacks (a very weak currency might force the government to take stronger measures), so it's easy for the results to be so dramatic. It is also questionable to assume that, on average, the price will keep changing as it has since July 9. Nevertheless, the model provides useful information as to the amount of uncertainty we can expect. The results here and the previous results in my original post show that given the high recent volatility, it is difficult to see the price ending within the relatively tight window of 6-7 (unless one has a reason to believe that volatility will change significantly).

This makes it much less likely than I originally assumed that he will let the central bank (which is under his control) raise rates (which is the standard macroeconomist prescription to such predicaments. It is for example believed to have gotten Argentina out of their recent currency crisis).  Therefore, one of the main short term fixes that could have boosted the lira is very unlikely to take place. This makes me think that the probability of the lira strengthening from here is much lower. Turkey could still respond to the crisis with fiscal measures but given their high borrowing costs and maturing debt, this might be only a partial solution.

The tensions between the U.S. and Turkey run deep. Erdogan entertains the suspicion that the U.S. was behind the failed coup attempt in 2016 and holds a grudge against the U.S. refusal to extradite Fethullah Gulen\n* underlying economic conditions that primed the currency for a potential fall\n   - a long period of low interest rates that had overheated the economy, leading to inflation\n   - a current account deficit (Turkey borrows in order to import more than it exports). \n   - impending near term load repayments. Turkey has $100 billion in loans maturing over the next year. Since they'd have to sell lira and buy USD to service the loans, that puts pressure on the currency\n* US Fed raising rates, causing the dollar to appreciate against other currencies (including an impending very likely Sept rate hike)\n* All resulting in reinforcing feedback loops\n   - Turkish banks now have to borrow at higher rates, which raises concerns for their ability to pay back down the road. Higher interest rates lead to tighter credit conditions within the Turkish economy, which slows it down, putting more pressure on the lira\nSources: See, e.g. [1, 2, 3]  Given the underlying reasons mentioned above, this is a question mainly of policy and politics. A recent recovery has taken place since August 13 and the lira currently stands at ~6.1 TYR/USD. This price represents the market view of the impacts of all of the known factors mentioned above in addition to the market's assigned probabilities of near-term events. So whether and how the price changes from this number, depends on how the unknown factors (see Inside View below) shake out (note that although some events happen in the future, such as the Sept rate hike and Turkey's maturing loans, those are probably already priced in and that there is little uncertainty about them so I don' think they will be decisive factors). ~~~\nOutside view\n~~~ I built a Monte Carlo (MC) model to try to estimate the uncertainty in where the price could end up by end November (=65 working days of trading). I took historical daily USD/TYR data [4] from July 9 to today. July 9 is an arbitrary choice for roughly when the market started showing significant signs of turmoil based on [5]. Alternative model formulations could include alternative timelines.  I built a normal distribution using the standard deviation of the daily % changes (this equaled 3.4). I assumed an average of 0 (equally likely for the price to go down as up). I then perform MC simulations (10,000 iterations), which start with the current price  (6.1), sample from the distribution of % daily price changes, add them to the price, and estimate a final Nov 30 price. Finally, I get a distribution from the 10,000 outcomes from the MC. Results:\n<5: 28% of outcomes fell here\n5-6: 24%\n6-7: 21%\n7: 27% Conclusion so far: if one uses the recent currency volatility as an indication for the volatility up to Nov 30, we should expect a wide range of outcomes. It could be instructive to consider doing this MC analysis using other timeframes, or using data from other currency crises as an estimate for a reasonable currency volatility (i.e. standard deviation to assume in the model). e.g. from this paper [6] ~~~\nInside view\n~~~ Unknown factors that will decide the outcome include:\n* Decisions by Turkey and/or the U.S. on the release/extradition of Brunson and/or Gulen\n* Turkey's fiscal and monetary policy response\n* Market sentiment - traders might over/under-react. A particular event could trigger a reinforcing feedback loop leading to an across-the-board selling of the lira. Alternatively, the market could underreact to improving economic circumstances in Turkey as trust in the financial stability and credit-worthiness might take time to be restored (financial crises take longer to resolve than other economic predicaments). The first uncertainty concerns a battle of egos between Erdogan and Trump. The popular perception of Erdogan is that he doesn't back down but he did take a soft stance when Turkey downed a Russian jet. Trump similarly softened on North Korea even though they only offered minor concessions. From Trump's perspective, the U.S. should be worried about threat of economic contagion from a down falling Turkey as well as Turkey aligning itself more closely with Russia. From Erdogan's perspective, the spat with Trump gives him a scapegoat to pin the blame to, which appears to be working to some extent: in a recent survey 42 percent blamed foreign governments for  Turkey's problems and only 36 percent said it was the AKP government [1]. Erdogan is expending a lot of effort to keep the Turkish public on his side, traveling the country, giving up to three speeches per day [7] and his grip on the media helps him turn the public against the U.S. However, the economic turmoil does hurt his popularity according to recent surveys quoted here [1].  So, both sides would benefit from a mutual face-saving resolution but Erdogan has an incentive to keep it going and Trump may not be sensitive to the economic and geopolitical (Russia alignment by Turkey) consequences. It is hard to come up with a probability but in the courageous style of Fermi, I am guesstimating and assume a 30% likelihood before end Nov. A resolution would probably have a significant effect on the price and market sentiment as it has been one of the main drivers lately. However, it wouldn't solve all of Turkey's underlying economic problems so I am guessing it would place the price just above 5. A lack of resolution would probably induce a slow rise in the lira. The second factor is a more likely source of bullishness for the Lira. Allowing a raise of interest rates would help boost the currency. Erdogan has to consider the fact that a currency crisis could cause him to loose his position. A leader is 70% more likely to lose his post in the six months following a currency crisis [8]. He supposedly wants to stay in power and allowing rates to rise would be an obvious way to alleviate economic burdens and claim credit with the public. The central bank has already implemented a back door tightening by making banks borrow at slightly higher rates. However, no other specific fiscal or monetary measures are on the horizon yet; from today's FT: \"In previous statements, including a conference call two weeks ago with investors, Mr Albayrak has vowed to take measures to shore up the Turkish economy. But he has refrained from giving any indication that monetary tightening \u2014 something that many analysts see as critical to propping up the lira \u2014 is on the horizon.\" It will be important to watch the publication of Turkey\u2019s medium-term program for the economy, which Finance minister Albayrak said he would announce in the first half of September. All in all, I am assuming that some sort of stimulus is probable (say 65%) Third, market sentiment and reactions to existing information might still be ongoing (meaning that the market has yet to fully price in the crisis). This suggests a higher likelihood of a lower lira as the market continues to price in the economic risks and as feedback loops (credit crunch hurting the economy, further tightening credit) are playing out. Conclusions: a lack of resolution to the dispute with the US skews the outcome in bearish direction (i.e. lira ending lower than current levels). However, a potential economic stimulus would do the opposite. These two counteracting factors increase the likelihood of the price staying closer to current levels rather than farther away. I am therefore increasing the chances of 5-7 relative to the tails from what I estimated with the MC analysis above. A slight lean toward 6-7 and >7 reflects the potential that market sentiment and economic feedback loops could continue to unravel to the detriment of the lira.

So let's break it down stepwise ... ASSUMPTION ONE\nThe \"wisdom of the crowd\" means that the current price is the best guess for the price going forwards - the mean estimate, if not the median.  With the current price of 6.01, and an overall long-term tendency for the rate to slowly increase with time, I estimate that it is about 55:45 that the price on 30 November will be above:below 6.00. ASSUMPTION TWO\nIt is very difficult to imagine a situation where there is sufficient good news (for Turkey) in a short space of time sufficient to push the rate back below 5.00.  Thing had been looking shaky BEFORE the recent confrontation with the USA, and the price has been persistently above 4.00 since early April, and at or above 4.50 since mid-May.  Thus, IF the rate falls from here, it is MUCH more likely that the rate will still remain above 5.00.  Let's call this 10:1. ASSUMPTION THREE\nAt the peak of the panic two weeks ago, the price jumped JUST above 7.00.  For the rate to exceed 7.00 on 30 November, the \"situation\" would have to be even worse than the pessimistic views on 13 August.  This is UNLIKELY, but is more likely than the idea that the situation will improve to being better for Turkey than it has been for many months (ie. a rate under 5.00).  Thus, IF the rate rises from here, it is more likely that the rate will not exceed 7.00.  Let's call this 4:1.
