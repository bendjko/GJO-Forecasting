Trump is egotistical, and it seems very unlikely (<2%) that he would meet someone who has been so critical of him. I assume this is unlikely to be a popular move among many of Trump's followers. Trump is someone who doesn't appear to have firm beliefs or values and tends to do what will make him popular among his followers making such a meeting very unlikely (<2%). I am not too familiar with Kaepernick himself, but it appears to me he is hugely critical of Trump and would only meet if he believed he could change his mind on the issue of race relations in the US. I cannot find a supporting poll, but it seems obvious to say most Trump supporters disagree with Kaepernick's actions. Kaepernick would know this, and therefore knows Trump would lose a lot of votes if he concedes anything to Kaepernick. I therefore think he is very unlikely (<1%) to want to meet Trump. To my knowledge, Trump has only been extremely critical of Kaepernick's movement and has not considered the possibility of any validity of Kaepernick's actions. There therefore seems no basis for a productive discussion on the issue. Whilst Trump is certainly capable of making u-turns when it comes to his opinions. Making one with regards to this seems incredibly unlikely (<0.01%) given it would lose him a large amount of his support.
