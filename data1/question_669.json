Both of his political fore bearers, Presidents Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun, conducted meetings with the North Korean leader at the time which gives me the indication it is almost certain that such a meeting will occur eventually.  A meeting date has now been set. (99%) 2. Previous meetings between North and South Korean leaders occurred, however, well into the administrations of the South Korean presidents, (two years 4 months into President Kim Dae-jung's term and four years and eight months into President Roh Moo-hyun's term) dampening the chance that a meeting will occur before 1 November 2018 (only one year and six months into President Moon Jae-in's term). (49%) 3. My third factor has to do with high tension years. When this question was first posted we were observing a period of tension not seen in decades. Previous high tension years such as 2002 and 2010 did not have meetings. That being said, the tension has dropped dramatically over the last two months. With the date now set I'm going to increase this factors probability to 90%. I am still concerned about the effect of ROK-US military exercises (scheduled to start 1 Apr) and how KJU might react to strategic signalling coming out of Washington DC (Bolton in as NSA, Trump getting cold feet on their meeting). The military exercises might become a convenient excuse to cancel or postpone the KJU-Moon meeting. (90%) 4. The last factor regards KJU meeting other foreign leaders. His predecessors met with foreign leaders such as China and Russia prior to meeting his South Korean counterparts. My probabilities have moved from 10% to 50% to 90% to 99% with the news of KJU going to Beijing.

Both of his political forebearers, Presidents Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun, conducted meetings with the North Korean leader at the time which gives me the indication it is almost certain that such a meeting will occur eventually. (99%) 2. Previous meetings between North and South Korean leaders occurred, however, well into the administrations of the South Korean presidents, (two years 4 months into President Kim Dae-jung's term and four years and eight months into President Roh Moo-hyun's term) dampening the chance that a meeting will occur before 1 November 2018 (only one year and six months into President Moon Jae-in's term). (49%) 3. My third factor had to do with high tension years. When this question was first posted we were observing a period of tension not seen in decades. Previous high tension years such as 2002 and 2010 did not have meetings. That being said, the tension has dropped dramatically over the last two months. I think I've been lo on this factor to a fault. I'm going to increase this factors probability to 60%. I am still concerned about the effect of ROK-US military exercises (scheduled to start 1 Apr) and how KJU might react to strategic signalling coming out of Washington DC (Bolton in as NSA, Trump getting cold feet on their meeting). The military exercises might become a convenient excuse to cancel or postpone the KJU-Moon meeting. (60%) 4. I'm altering the last factor as North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has now met with another foreign leader during his term in office (His predecessors met with foreign leaders such as China and Russia prior to meeting his South Korean counterparts). That being said, Kim Jong-un is not his father and thus may be a bit of a wildcard. He seems to feel much more isolated by China and meeting the South Korean leader could give him some leverage. My probabilities have moved from 10% to 50% to 90% to 99% with today\u2019s news of KJU going to Beijing. It's not 100% as we still don't know it will actually occur (no date set).

The US had been demanding that denuclearisation must be the goal of any talks. Surprisingly, Kim said this would be on the table. In Trump\u2019s inimitable style, accepting Kim\u2019s offer of a summit was a one-man decision, made seemingly on the spur of the moment without the benefit of input from a depleted State Department. He reversed the normal practice of working-level talks to set the stage and contours before the heads of state meet. A great deal could go wrong with such an approach. Victor Cha, a leading North Korean scholar who would have been on the State Department team had he not been pulled as ambassador-nominee to Seoul, warns that a failed summit could push the Peninsula to the brink of war. Another insulting tweet, an interdiction of a contraband-laden ship or a North Korean provocation could end the peace music at any time. Yet for now, Trump is moving the fraught Korean situation in the direction of peace and, dare one say, a potential solution to the North Korean threat. A petulant rebuff of Kim\u2019s offer would have closed off this opportunity. What does Kim mean by \u2018denuclearisation\u2019? North Korea always insists on the phrase \u2018denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula\u2019. This is a face-saving way of not accepting the sole onus of disarmament, even though the only nuclear weapons on the Peninsula are in the northern half. Pessimists note that North Korea often expands the definition to include US nuclear-armed submarines that often patrol in the waters off the Peninsula and the nuclear umbrella that the US extends as part of its security alliance with the Republic of Korea. The US will certainly not forego its extended deterrence guarantees. If negotiations ensue, the US will continue to demand the complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement of North Korea\u2019s nuclear programme. North Korea has accepted this goal at least twice before, in agreements in 1994 and 2005. Yet these and lesser commitments in other deals, including on Leap Day 2012, were never fully realised. How Trump can succeed where his predecessors have failed, especially given the shortage of time and talent in the present circumstances, is doubtful. So far, North Korea is not giving up much. A pause in its missile and nuclear testing while talks continue will not hamper the ongoing refinement of these systems. In any case, Kim claimed in his New Year\u2019s speech this year that North Korea had already attained its strategic goal of possessing a powerful deterrent. This was also the message that came after the successful test flight of the Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile on 29 November. It is noteworthy that Pyongyang did not insist on a suspension of US\u2013South Korea combined military exercises as a condition for talks, as it usually has in the past. The Foal Eagle field exercise is set to begin in April. Nor did Kim ask for a lifting of US sanctions. North Korea must be given credit for understanding that the US and its partners will continue to apply maximum pressure until concrete steps are made towards denuclearisation. At what price a handshake? Kim was after something else. Sitting at the table with the leader of the free world will give Kim the prestige every North Korean leader has sought. Certainly, it\u2019s a status that the dictator does not deserve. The ruler of a nuclear-armed prison state that has violated every international norm in the book \u2013 even combining chemical-weapons use with fratricide \u2013 does not deserve Trump\u2019s friendly handshake. This is why, at a White House meeting about North Korea in 2003 then-US Vice President Dick Cheney said \u2018We don't negotiate with evil; we defeat it\u2019. Yet Cheney\u2019s approach led to the unnecessary invasion of Iraq that year and the horrendously negative consequences that still haunt the Middle East in the form of the terrorism that it unleashed. Diplomacy requires the holding of one\u2019s nose, and dealing with adversaries. A handshake is not a heavy price to pay for the potential benefit. I do not expect North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. They are too central to its sense of regime preservation. But we cannot know for sure. Until this week, no foreign official had spoken directly with the North Korean leader. (Dennis Rodman does not count.) And only Kim has the authority to make such a momentous decision. South Korean National Security Advisor Chung Eui-yong and the other members of his five-person delegation were the first outsiders to meet Kim, who hosted at extraordinary four-hour dinner on 5 March. A North\u2013South Korean summit is now set to take place in Panmunjom in April. A Kim\u2013Trump summit would follow.

Both of his political forebearers, Presidents Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun, conducted meetings with the North Korean leader at the time which gives me the indication it is almost certain that such a meeting will occur eventually. (99%) 2. Previous meetings between North and South Korean leaders occurred, however, well into the administrations of the South Korean presidents, (two years 4 months into President Kim Dae-jung's term and four years and eight months into President Roh Moo-hyun's term) dampening the chance that a meeting will occur before 1 November 2018 (only one year and six months into President Moon Jae-in's term). (49%) 3. I've further downgraded the likelihood because no previous meeting occurred in previous high tension years such as 2002 and 2010. (1%) 4. The last factor is the fact that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has not met with ANY foreign leader during his term in office. His predecessor met with foreign leaders such as China and Russia prior to meeting his South Korean counterparts. That being said, Kim Jong-un is not his father and thus may be a bit of a wildcard. He seems to feel much more isolated by China and meeting the South Korean leader could give him some leverage. My probabilities have moved from 10% to 50% to now 90% with today\u2019s announcement. It's not 100% as we don't know it will actually occur. For example we still expect to have the postponed US-ROK military exercises occur which may produce a rationale for KJU to renege on the invitation. I\u2019ve also altered my weights. I originally weighted the first and third factors the heaviest due to their historic evidence by doubling their weights and left the second and fourth factors alone as the vagaries of a presidential term are extremely non-linear and the wild card is obviously so. With today\u2019s news I will double weight the first and fourth factors and leave the second and third alone.

The banquet, which stretched on for more than four hours, according to the South Korean president\u2019s office, could signal a new phase of rapprochement as the two Koreas seek to expand a diplomatic thaw that started ahead of the Winter Olympics and saw North Koreans travel to the Games and talk with counterparts from the South.\nDuring the dinner, the two Koreas struck a \u201csatisfactory agreement\u201d to stage a summit meeting between their leaders, the North said through its state media, which published photos of Mr. Kim laughing with the South\u2019s intelligence chief around a large table. Mr. Kim ordered his lieutenants \u201cto rapidly take practical steps\u201d for a summit meeting, according to the Korean Central News Agency report, which didn\u2019t elaborate on timing or other details. The South\u2019s statement didn\u2019t mention any agreement on a summit meeting, but a spokeswoman later said that there was \u201csomewhat of an agreement\u201d following some discussion of a summit meeting, without offering further details (para. 1-4).

Both of his political forebearers, Presidents Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun, conducted meetings with the North Korean leader at the time which gives me the indication it is almost certain that such a meeting will occur eventually. (99%) 2. Previous meetings between North and South Korean leaders occurred, however, well into the administrations of the South Korean presidents, (two years 4 months into President Kim Dae-jung's term and four years and eight months into President Roh Moo-hyun's term) dampening the chance that a meeting will occur before 1 November 2018 (only one year and six months into President Moon Jae-in's term). (49%) 3. I've further downgraded the likelihood because no previous meeting occurred in high tension years such as 2002 and 2010. (1%) 4. The last downgrading factor is the fact that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has not met with ANY foreign leader during his term in office. His predecessor met with foreign leaders such as China and Russia prior to meeting his South Korean counterparts. That being said, Kim Jong-un is not his father and thus may be a bit of a wildcard. He seems to feel much more isolated by China and meeting the South Korean leader could give him some leverage. Now that Kim Jong-un has invited Moon to Pyongyang I think this factor's original probability (10%) is too low. The difficulty is now where to place it. It's hardly 100% as we don't even know it will actually occur let alone occur before 1 November 2018. We still expect to have the postponed US-ROK military exercises to occur soon after the Olympic games which may decrease the positive environment for a face-to-face meeting if North Korea takes it as a slap in the face after the invite. Right now I will bump up my original probability for this factor to 50% and wait and see if further developments occur or more indications on the timing of the visit. I don't think each factor is equal so I weighted the first and third factors the heaviest due to their historic evidence by doubling their weights and left the second and fourth factors alone as the vagaries of a presidential term are extremely non-linear and the wild card is obviously so. That leaves a chance of around 49.83%. The weakest part of my forecast is in the weighting of the factors.

I see 2 things.\n1. USA. Trump actually make this both easier and dicier. The stance against NK along with the crazy talks of war coming from the Trump administration put Moon into a situation where SK is at the highest risk if war comes but he is also at risk of breaking with the strongest ally of SK if he tries to prevent it via dialogue. Not a great position to be in. \n2. Internal political groups that fear NK and Un. These groups are arguably the nearer influencers given Moon\u2019s short term needs (being a politician). I think the games and yo Jong have done a good job so far building credibility for dialogue amount the public in general but there will always be detractors. Interestingly, the invite was public, making Moon\u2019s decision as much about building relations as it is about creating the right face. Curiously, NK seems not to have mentioned the invite: https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20180211_11/. Looks like NK is potentially preparing for a rejection despite clearly having the invitation presented publicly in SK (and world wide). I wish there was better reporting on the specifics of the invite as I haven\u2019t found anything. It sounds to be more a cordial meet than summit negotiations. That would make sense as baby steps is what will get to a true deal. I\u2019m waiting to see when China comes into play. My guess they will probably facilitate backdoor conversations to iron out the details. Ultimately I think Moon both wants to say yes and is in a position where he almost has to say yes. If I were in his position I would backdoor a strategy to just, on the surface, hold superficial talks and build the concept of a unified Korea in the minds of all Koreans for the next 3 years. In the background I\u2019d really be working with China and maybe japan to build a full negotiation among all the countries that keeps everyone safe and happy.

Having Ms Kim in SK will increase the pressure for Moon Jae-in to go to meet Kim Jong-un. No invite for Trump will probably annoy Trump, but maybe Pence can get an invite as well. The problem for all concerned is that any solution to the NK problem needs talks, if the US refuses to agree that it is not unreasonable to start with a visit to NK by Moon Jae-in then the US looks like as if it standing in the way of a solution.  Presumably Trump would want KIm to make a gesture (in order for Trump to save face) which Kim will not do (in order for Kim to save face). So I would say its not a done deal. It would seem to require some high quality diplomacy to move forward. I am not sure that Trump can be controlled enough to carry it off.  A fairly easy \"concession\" for Kim to make would be to stop developing weapons or missiles. As long as no visible tests are done no one would know if development had stopped or not. We don't know if Kim wants any prior concessions from SK if he does then its unlikely that a visit would take place because SK would not want to make unilateral concessions.

According to reports coming out of the Blue House, Moon has \"practically accepted the invitation.\" I believe it is only a matter of time before the two leaders meet to discuss a resolution to their decades-long conflict. However, the only thing that could stop their meeting from happening would be concerns expressed by the US which has flip-flopped on a lot of its issues regarding diplomatic interactions with the DPRK. As of now, it appears as if the US would not like the DPRK to engage diplomatically with South Korea unless it agreed to end or cut back on its nuclear program. I don't believe, however, that the US will stand in the way of these two nations meeting.

North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests since 2006, including the latest and most powerful one in September 2017. It also fired three intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) last year, some of which are capable of reaching the U.S. mainland.

U.S. President Donald Trump is staging a \"maximum pressure' campaign to press the North to give up its nuclear arsenal.\" \"The North's invitation appears to be aimed at breaking its diplomatic isolation through better inter-Korean ties,\" said Shin Beom-chul, a professor at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy.

Previous meetings between North and South Korean leaders occurred, however, well into the administrations of the South Korean presidents, (two years 4 months into President Kim Dae-jung's term and four years and eight months into President Roh Moo-hyun's term) dampening the chance that a meeting will occur before 1 November 2018 (only one year and six months into President Moon Jae-in's term). (49%) 3. I've further downgraded the likelihood because no previous meeting occurred in high tension years such as 2002 and 2010. (1%) 4. The last downgrading factor is the fact that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has not met with ANY foreign leader during his term in office. His predecessor met with foreign leaders such as China and Russia prior to meeting his South Korean counterparts. That being said, Kim Jong-un is not his father and thus may be a bit of a wildcard. He seems to feel much more isolated by China and meeting the South Korean leader could give him some leverage. (10%) If each factor is weighed equally that would produce a chance of 39%. I don't think each factor should be equal so I weighted the first and third factors the heaviest due to their historic evidence by doubling their weights and left the second and fourth factors alone as the vagaries of a presidential term are extremely non-linear and the wild card is obviously so.

Dateline 1-6-2018 North Korea agreed on Friday to hold official talks with South Korea next week, the first in more than two years, hours after Washington and Seoul delayed a military exercise amid a standoff over the North\u2019s nuclear and missile programs.  -- https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-southkorea/north-korea-agrees-to-talks-after-u-s-south-korea-postpone-military-drills-idUSKBN1EU06O"], [43733, "2018-01-05T20:27:48Z", [0.05], ""], [691, "2018-01-05T16:54:16Z", [0.03], ""], [46607, "2018-01-05T13:40:34Z", [0.9], "Olympics are coming up and they've already started to open communication channels on that pretext"], [46557, "2018-01-05T13:39:30Z", [0.6], ""], [1034, "2018-01-05T11:46:47Z", [0.0], ""], [5386, "2018-01-05T03:29:37Z", [0.08], ""], [368, "2018-01-04T23:57:06Z", [0.0], ""], [46438, "2018-01-04T23:25:07Z", [0.4], ""], [368, "2018-01-04T19:33:38Z", [0.0], ""], [46025, "2018-01-04T19:11:50Z", [0.6], "It is probable that NK will use SK to negotiate concessions that will ease sanctions for NK, in exchange for \u201cpeace\u201d on the Korean Peninsula and a temporary reduction in Nuclear arms.

This is due primarily because of proximity, and SK having a lower global power than DC. Another point that indicates movement towards future talks is Kim\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve Address.
