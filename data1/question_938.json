In March 2015 the EU created the European External Action Service East Stratcom Task Force, which publishes weekly reports in its website 'EU vs Disinfo'. The website and its partners identified and debunked over 3,500 pro-Kremlin disinformation cases between September 2015 and November 2017, which means between 1512 to 1750 per year. At the moment when this forecast is made - 10.04.2019 - there have been 5209 cases recorded, which renders it relatively safe to assume that within a week's time the total number will not exceed 5500. I am 95% confident that this will remain so. It is also clear why the options below that number are outruled. Statistics for the past three years (2016-2018) indicate a monthly average of 126 cases, which means that it would take another 2.4 months for the number to exceed 5500.  There is a very small chance that the numbers will increase above the upper threshold. We can speculate that major events such as Brexit, the EU Parliament or Ukrainian elections will affect the tenacity of misinformation efforts, which is confirmed by the data available for the past month: during the month of March which was characterised by high uncertainty around the departure of the UK fromt the EU as well as the first round in the Ukrainian presidential race, 177 cases between the beginning of March until today, exceeding the monthly average by roughly 50 cases. As shown by history, RUssia has a particular interest in Ukraine's domestic politics.  A report titled 'How Russian media foments hostility towards West' published by the Black Sea Trust for Regional Cooperation and the Hybrid Warfare Analytical Group of Ukraine Crisis Media Centershows that the Russian Pervyi Kanal is represented in the 5000+ database with 440 cases, many of which come from the Vremya Pokazhet program wihch historically has been engaging in bashing Ukraine. The latest disinformation from that show exists in the database is about the West pushing Poroshenko to power again and him using a military clash with Russia to postpone the election. In second place is Rossiya 1 with 295 cases in the database. The talk shows 60 Minut and Vecher s Vladimirom Solovyovym have a high potential to try to manipulate the framing of the Ukrainian elections (e.g. \"The outcome of Ukrainian election will be decided in Washington\"). This indicates that it is likely that the Ukrainian elections in 2019 will lead to an increase in the number of cases in the month of April, when the second round will take place. However, there have been 0 cases recorded in the last week.\nAlthough the numbers contained in the EU report may or may not be absolute, it is very unlikely that the numbers will exceed my forecast.

As argued before, the EU elections should be attractive to disinformation campaigns. However, the last forecast didn't account for the Ukrainian election which represents a highly attractive target for disinformation cases, too. The increase of the base rate beyond its estimated maximum level is based on the (more or less) simultaneous election periods. The effect of the Ukrainian election should hold on due to the extension into the second round which ends mid-April. Nonetheless, it is very likely that the (current and future) increase of the base rate won\u2019t be enough regarding the fact that it has to increase by the factor 2,2 in order to reach the threshold of 5500 cases. As a result, the probability for this case will be set down to 1%, while the probability for the 6300 threshold vanishes to 0%. The 1% probability reflects the uncertainty involved in such propaganda campaigns.  (Disclaimer: the version before stated a 3% probability for the 5500 threshold and a 1% likelihood for the 6300-threshold. After taking account of other forecasts by GJO users I adjusted mine. The reason lies in the practicality of the forecast itself. While there are still arguments for a 1% chance for the 6300-threshold, this outcome seems practically 'non-existent'.)

The monthly average of 2017 and 2018 are very similar. In contrast, the average and the final total amount of cases for 2016 are (roughly) 1,6 times higher. This spike could be caused by the US presidential elections and the increased media attention for possible Russian attempts to influence the election. As mentioed before the EU election will take place in May, hence, the election campaigns will start in late March to early April. The EU election represent a similar opportunity to influence the European political landscape as the US election. As a result, it is very likely that the rate for the remaining months will converge with the rate for 2016. An average of 165 cases in February 2019 support this assumption.  As a result: \nFor the last two options the  future base rate has to be higher than the 2016 base rate. For 'more than 6300' the rate has to rise by the factor 7. For 'between 5500 and 6300' the rate has to raise by the factor (approx.) 2,5. None are very likely as this means that the Russian Federation would assess the EU elections by far more important the the US election (in the case of a deliberate attempt to influence these elections). However, there is still a realistic chance for an increase by the factor 2,5. The 1% probability is based on the uncertainty involved in such intelligence agency actions and the technological capability of the Russian services. Finally, the probability for more than 4900 and less than 5500 seems to be the most likely outcome.  *(Disclaimer: The used categories of the website aren't distinctive. \"For the past year\" or \"for the past 2 years\" could mean '2018/2017' or 'the last 12/24 months from now on'.

Last month (February) with 2 days less than a standard month there were 178 disinformation cases. This makes about 6 cases per day. Should the rate of reporting stays stable this will account to a steady reporting of  around 180 for March and around 114 more until 19th April 2018.

Adding these to the 5107 will account to slightly less than 5500. However, investigative process is still on, therefore while new disinformation reports are shelved, there are past cases that are being investigated too.

If it was influential or not on the results is not the point, but the existence of such a phenomenon is an alert for the European task force.

As of today - 2 March 2018 - there already have been 4973 Russian disinformation campaigns registered by the EEAS; thus, a higher number than given in the first two options. The forecast at hand estimates a likelihood of 65% that there will be in total 4901 till 5499 Russian disinformation campaigns noted on 18 April 2019. Even in 2016, a year to be considered very turbulent for wold politics and Russian interests - Brexit, US elections, refugee crises in Europe and Russian supported military operations in Syria, e.g. in Eastern Aleppo (https://www.cfr.org/blog/ten-most-significant-world-events-2016), there were only 2023 Russian disinformation campaigns detected by the EEAS - an average of 169 cases per month. Even if it is assumed that those numbers vary from month to month and peak during events, considered as strategically important to Russia, an increase about more than one third seems rather unlikely, in particular given the fact that last months there were only 178 counted as well. However, three events in March (and May) could lead to a drastic increase of detected information campaigns: First, presidential elections are to be hold in the Ukraine on 31 March 2019. Due to the on-going conflict between Russia and the Ukraine pro-Russian public support has decreased drastically (https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/why-pro-russian-candidates-won-t-win-ukraine-s-2019-elections). Thus, Russia could expand its disinformation campaigns in order to make up for these losses and prevent a further approximation of the Ukraine and the EU. The UK\u2019s - yet not so sure - exit from the EU is originally planed to be realized on 29 March 2019. Given to Russians previous pro-Brexit engagement (https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/10/17/russian-iranian-twitter-trolls-sent-10-million-tweets-fake-news/), a rise of detected case might be counted. Finally, the elections for the EU parliament will be hold between 23 - 26 May 2019. Not only is an increase in Anti-EU disinformation campaigns of Russia expected to happen before (March/April), e.g. to promote anti-EU parties, but also an increased engagement by the EEAS to detect those attacks in order to safeguard the elections. This could also impact the two former mentioned points (Ukraine/Brexit) and will most likely cause an increase in cases detected. Thus the forecast at hand estimates an 35% chance that 5500 - 6300 cases of Russian disinformation campaigns will be detected by the EEAS. Finally, the forecast at hand rules out the fifth option. In 2017, there were a total of 1321 cases detected, when e.g. Germany and France held - for Russia - crucial elections.

I assume the number hasn't been updated yet. So, the last year goes from roughly September 2017 to September 2018. For a rough approximation, I assume that every month had the same amount of cases and conclude, that 2018 so far saw 7/11 * 960 = 636 cases, with an average monthly rate of 87 cases.  Now, the rate of new cases has decreased significantly over the last 2 years, so it seems sensible to include this, too. I'll just guess that it will fall to an average of 70 cases per month in the months till April.  In total, as of today, we have 4214 cases. If I expect 70 cases per month until April, and that August hasn't been updated yet, my point estimate would be about 4214 + 665 = 4879. Reasons for doubt and uncertainty:\n- can I expect future decrease in numbers from the past? This might have been caused by developments that change (elections in the EU as targets, arms race between disinformers and task force)\n- assumptions might be false (have there been 0 cases in the last month?)\n- I don't know how cases are classified (it is rated for being a false information that is \"in line with usual pro-Kremlin disinformation messaging\". Also, the exact details might change in the future and more or less instances will be classified as misinformation.\n- this ignores the seemingly ever decreasing rate of new cases Based on that, I will intuitively distribute the probability clay.  \t1) 2% - Less than 4300\n\t2) 48% - Between 4300 and 4900, inclusive\n\t3) 40% - More than 4900 but less than 5500\n\t4) 10% - Between 5500 and 6300, inclusive\n\t5) 0% - More than 6300 What do the top comments and consensus votes say? \t- JMR2017 has way higher extrapolations compared to mine, it seems because the number of cases this year has not been rising much since his prediction in April. He expects a rise due the midterm elections in the US, which leds me to update a little towards higher numbers.\n\t- less disagreement with other top-voted forecasts \t1) 2% - Less than 4300\n\t2) 45% - Between 4300 and 4900, inclusive\n\t3) 43% - More than 4900 but less than 5500\n\t4) 10% - Between 5500 and 6300, inclusive\n\t5) 0% - More than 6300\n"], [691, "2018-08-27T12:39:28Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.71, 0.14, 0.0], ""], [2965, "2018-08-25T16:56:40Z", [0.0, 0.6, 0.4, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [172, "2018-08-23T20:59:57Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.8, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2018-08-23T15:16:08Z", [0.0, 0.35, 0.55, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [2965, "2018-08-23T11:58:46Z", [0.0, 0.75, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [60394, "2018-08-23T11:20:34Z", [0.03, 0.15, 0.27, 0.35, 0.2], ""], [29054, "2018-08-22T20:13:07Z", [0.0, 0.21, 0.69, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [691, "2018-08-22T13:06:35Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.71, 0.14, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2018-08-21T14:17:11Z", [0.0, 0.25, 0.6, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [35636, "2018-08-20T15:16:36Z", [0.0, 0.12, 0.58, 0.3, 0.0], "Comment deleted on Sep 08, 2020 02:48PM UTC"], [2965, "2018-08-20T14:25:32Z", [0.0, 0.75, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [28414, "2018-08-20T13:06:35Z", [0.0, 0.6, 0.4, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [57778, "2018-08-20T06:14:08Z", [0.0, 0.52, 0.47, 0.01, 0.0], ""], [2965, "2018-08-20T02:55:51Z", [0.0, 0.75, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [172, "2018-08-19T23:50:43Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.8, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [43588, "2018-08-19T17:07:49Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "There are more than anyone would believe.

Separate ads, launched simultaneously, would stoke suspicion about how police treat black people in one ad, while another encouraged support for pro-police groups.\"\n\"Divisive racial ad buys averaged about 44 per month from 2015 through the summer of 2016 before seeing a significant increase in the run-up to Election Day.\"\nThis is interesting: \"An additional 900 [race-related spots] were posted after the November election through May 2017.\"\n\"Only about 100 of the ads overtly mentioned support for Donald Trump or opposition to Hillary Clinton.\" Go deeper!\nSee also  Vox:https://www.vox.com/2018/3/1/17062036/trump-russia-midterm-election-2018\n\" President Donald Trump has barely acknowledged that Russians meddled in the 2016 presidential election, and now it looks like he\u2019s doing nothing to prevent Moscow from interfering again. Adm. Michael Rogers, who leads US Cyber Command, told lawmakers on Tuesday that Trump has yet to direct him to strike Russia\u2019s cyber operations where they start. That means Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2014 who directed the campaign to disrupt the last US presidential election \u2014 has yet to see any serious repercussions for his country\u2019s actions. Worse, there are almost no substantive measures in place to prevent Russia from meddling in the upcoming 2018 midterm elections. The problem, according to Rogers, is he needs specific authorization from the president to go on offense and directly disrupt the hackers\u2019 operations. Without that, he sees no reason why Russia would stop trying to tamper with US elections anytime soon. Rogers did mention, however, that he already ordered some secret measures to defend against Russia\u2019s interference before the next ballots are cast in a few months. \u201cIf we don\u2019t change the dynamic here, this is going to continue, and 2016 won\u2019t be viewed as something isolated,\u201d Rogers told the Senate Armed Services Committee. \u201cThis is something that will be sustained over time.\u201d Michael Sulmeyer, a former top cyber official at the Pentagon, also feels the US should target Russia\u2019s election hackers. \u201cYou don\u2019t just wait here and play defense, you also go out and stop this from happening again,\u201d he told me.\"\nend quote  I conclude that  Russian GRU in combination with \nCambridge Analytics targeted 100 counties in Iowa, Ohio, Wisconsin and PA\nand tipped them from 60/40 Obama/Mccain and  Romney to 60% Trump  ONLY 60,000 votes in 100 counties could have elected Trump.\nWhile no one can say in an intelligence assessment for US\nthat election result would have been different\nthere is a real possibility that Mr. Putin was the point of the spear\nand  elected Mr. Trump.

And the idea was always to push division, as seen by tactics like flooding Facebook with ads from groups like \u201cBlack Matters\u201d after Dylann Roof murdered nine black people at a church in Charleston, SC.\" 5-12-2018 update\n1) Protect election infrastructure. Trump should direct states to upgrade voter registration systems, voting machines, tally servers, and any other machinery that helps collect and verify votes. While federal officials have done a lot to improve the equipment since the 2016 election, the government could do a lot more.\n\u201cWe need to replace outdated systems,\u201d said Lawrence Norden, an elections expert at the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, including \u201creplacing paperless electronic voting machines\u201d and \u201cconducting post-election audits to compare the paper records to software generated results.\u201d 2) Improve transparency in social media. The Russians used fake social media accounts to sow divisions in the United States among racial, ethnic, gender, and partisan lines \u2014 in part by paying for bogus advertisements. The government could put more pressure on Twitter and Facebook to better identify where the money for ad buys come from, according to Claire Finkelstein, an elections expert at the University of Pennsylvania. Similarly, these companies could also help users better identify what is \u2014 and is not \u2014 \u201cfake news.\u201d 3) Deter Russia from interfering again. One way the US could do this is use covert action and information operations to make it harder for Russian hackers to do their job, Glenn Carle, a former CIA officer, told Stewart. If the hackers have to spend more time fighting off American attacks, they have less time to meddle in the election. Further, Sulmeyer told me that the US could empower members of its military cyber forces to attack Russian hackers. That would directly punish the people who most prominently tampered with the US election process.\n The problem is the Trump administration has done little in each of these areas \u2014 and other leaders have started to take matters into their own hands.\nHere are just a few examples: The Boston Globe reports Virginia election officials have returned to using paper ballots; Pennsylvania\u2019s government wants election equipment to produce paper records of votes; and Georgia may also use paper instead of using touch screens.\nThere are good reasons for states to worry. Department of Homeland Security officials confirmed in a June 2017 Senate intelligence hearing that Russia targeted at least 21 states, and hackers probed their registration systems. However, only Illinois election officials testified to a breach \u2014 \u201ca malicious cyber-attack of unknown origin\u201d that hit the Illinois voter registration system and allowed hackers to access 90,000 voter registration record. If the US is going to disrupt these attacks, the only sure protection for election infrastructure\nis paper ballots. The only deterrence comes from unleashing the unique advantages of NSA/CIA in any realm of cyber-warfare US has superiority See Stuxnet, DPRK missile failures... might be time to take some serious and sustained attacks at the most vital part of Russian cash-crash Gazprom's and Rosneft pipelines for a few days is certain to get attention. Collapsing Russian oil and gas production  for a time period would deter.   Datasets like this seem useless, but any data set is useless if US will not punch back\nTransparency in social media?
