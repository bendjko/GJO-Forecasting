It is just my opinion, but not verifiably wrong.  But I am making these changes to remind myself that when I make such comments, I risk having partisan people waste my time with their pointless nonsense.  And the only thing worse than listening to a politician talk and say nothing, is listening to one of their hangers-on.  Modestly titled VoiceOfMan is just another parrot of this flock, and he has harrassed many others who voice any opinion even slightly negative toward democratic candidates, or positive towards republicans.   It is my opinion that any administration would have done all it reasonably could to cover for a presidential candidate of their own party.  So I remain skeptical, and I think anyone with an ounce of sense would be as well.   However, this is not the most important issue.

So for all we know they could already be building a case against Hillary and prepping a grand jury for the trial. \nMy personal theory was that the timing of this is not coincidental. The e-mail controversy became public in March 2015 and there was ample time to bring up charges before she managed to: \n1. delete >90% of the all the emails that contained classified information and provide only personal 'innocent' emails.\n2. blame her assistants that they were the ones who didn't handle the servers and the communications properly.\n3. cherry-pick and provide the authorities only the emails she wanted them to see (c. 5-6%)\nSo they delayed this event as much as they could in order to reach the 'immune' status she currently enjoys because of wallstreet investment banks lobby and other organizations: https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cid=N00000019&cycle=Career\nIn this way she would clear all charges against her in a way only possible through this particular circumstances. If she didn't enjoy her current status I believe situation would be much different.\nAlso these sort of proceedings are largely decided by Loretta Lynch ( Bill's old friend, whom she owes).\nThis hurts her chances for the presidential election but she still escapes unscarred a situation that would translate to 10 - 15 years of prison time under different circumstances.

Although we don\u2019t normally make public our recommendations to the prosecutors, we frequently make recommendations and engage in productive conversations with prosecutors about what resolution may be appropriate, given the evidence. In this case, given the importance of the matter, I think unusual transparency is in order. Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case. Prosecutors necessarily weigh a number of factors before bringing charges. There are obvious considerations, like the strength of the evidence, especially regarding intent. Responsible decisions also consider the context of a person\u2019s actions, and how similar situations have been handled in the past. In looking back at our investigations into mishandling or removal of classified information, we cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts. All the cases prosecuted involved some combination of: clearly intentional and willful mishandling of classified information; or vast quantities of materials exposed in such a way as to support an inference of intentional misconduct; or indications of disloyalty to the United States; or efforts to obstruct justice. We do not see those things here. To be clear, this is not to suggest that in similar circumstances, a person who engaged in this activity would face no consequences. To the contrary, those individuals are often subject to security or administrative sanctions. But that is not what we are deciding now. As a result, although the Department of Justice makes final decisions on matters like this, we are expressing to Justice our view that no charges are appropriate in this case.\"\nhttps://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/statement-by-fbi-director-james-b.-comey-on-the-investigation-of-secretary-hillary-clintons-use-of-a-personal-e-mail-system"], [3225, "2016-07-07T04:15:28Z", [0.0], ""], [783, "2016-07-07T03:58:22Z", [0.0], "Attorney General Accepts Recommendation Not to Charge Hillary Clinton\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/07/us/politics/hillary-clinton-loretta-lynch.htm WASHINGTON \u2014 The investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server is over, Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch said on Wednesday. In a brief written statement, she said she accepted the F.B.I.\u2019s recommendation that no one be charged in the case, which has engulfed Mrs. Clinton\u2019s presidential ambitions for more than a year. \u201cI received and accepted their unanimous recommendation that the thorough, year-long investigation be closed and that no charges be brought against any individuals within the scope of the investigation,\u201d Mrs. Lynch said. The attorney general said she met with James B. Comey, the director of the F.B.I., and other prosecutors and agents on Wednesday afternoon before closing the case. Ms. Lynch had promised to accept the F.B.I. recommendations after creating a political furor by meeting on her airplane last week for 30 minutes with former President Bill Clinton. The announcement by Mrs. Lynch came on the eve of a congressional hearing Thursday morning at which Mr. Comey is scheduled to testify about the email investigation and the decision not to pursue charges. Mr. Comey announced his recommendation on Tuesday despite finding that Mrs. Clinton and her top aides were \u201cextremely careless\u201d in their distribution of classified information across unsecured email networks. The apparent contradiction in Mr. Comey\u2019s recommendation is expected to be the focus of sharp, bipartisan questioning at the hearing. But it is unclear whether Mr. Comey will be willing to provide any additional details about the investigation or the process investigators used to reach their conclusions. For Mrs. Clinton, the public announcement by the attorney general formally ends a legal cloud that has been shadowing her campaign and comes just weeks before she will accept her party\u2019s nomination to be president. But as the Republicans\u2019 quick decision to hold congressional hearings proves, the political damage from her use of a private email server is most likely not over. That damage was compounded on Tuesday when Mr. Comey said Mrs. Clinton should have known better than to allow such sensitive material to be sent over an unsecured network. Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign, said on Twitter, \u201cWith the AG accepting Director Comey\u2019s recommendation, this case is resolved, no matter Republicans\u2019 attempts to continue playing politics.\u201d"], [689, "2016-07-07T02:39:20Z", [0.0], "Comment deleted on Jul 07, 2016 02:40AM UTC"], [21, "2016-07-07T01:45:37Z", [0.0], ""], [26390, "2016-07-07T01:02:39Z", [0.0], "Nope!"], [14531, "2016-07-07T00:53:18Z", [0.0], "\"The investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server is over, Attorney General Loretta E.

The FBI is still gathering information.  Who knows how many more people the FBI wants to interview or how long it will take them to come to some conclusions after the completion of their investigation, and write up recommendations.  I expect the FBI report to be very thorough and comprehensive, and to leave no possible mis-deed un-investigated or unreported. I think that the FBI may lean towards a recommendation of indictment to justify the time & expense of its investigation, and because to do so it needs only to find probable cause. I believe that the DoJ will take considerable time to review the FBI findings.   I think it will take the DoJ a significant amount of time to put together the arguments to support any indictment(s) because of the need to develop a case that will meet the reasonable-doubt standard.  Pressures on the DoJ to delay/ignore by the Democrats and expedite/amplify by Republicans will be offsetting.   I believe that the DoJ will do its best to be impartial.  I was shocked by the AG's stupid meeting with Bill Clinton; having made such a stupid mistake, I doubt that any similar mistake(s) will be made.  I expect that everyone in the DoJ will be scrupulously neutral from here on out. So far, while there appears to be evidence of naivete, stupidity, stubbornness, a few errors, and some sloppiness, most attorneys say there's not evidence of the gross negligence which is necessary for a crime. Bottomline for me is that I think that the FBI will find smoke, but the DoJ will not find fire, and that a grand jury will not be empaneled to vote to indict before this question closes.\n"], [14531, "2016-07-04T21:06:09Z", [0.02], "Crawling back down off the ledge after reading @scholarandcat's helpful post: https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/273796"], [691, "2016-07-04T20:24:14Z", [0.0], ""], [25745, "2016-07-04T18:57:10Z", [0.0], "No real grounds for it (except in minds of GOP leaders)."], [5001, "2016-07-04T16:59:18Z", [0.1], ""], [532, "2016-07-04T15:38:37Z", [0.01], "After the events of the last few days, I wanted to post some thoughts about what the question means, how it can resolve, and what affect the FBI\u2019s recommendation will have on the outcome.  The question asks whether Hillary Clinton will be indicted. There are multiple ways to get a defendant in front of a judge, but the question narrows those options to one: the indictment.  Neither a deal between Clinton and the government in lieu of an indictment nor the DOJ charging Clinton with a non-indictable offense will resolve the question.  Obviously, Clinton will not be indicted if the FBI investigation fails to uncover evidence of a crime.\n\nAssuming the FBI does recommend an indictable offense, keep in mind that an indictment comes from a grand jury and *only* a grand jury.  The DOJ may accept the FBI\u2019s recommendation but that still does not mean Clinton has been indicted.  The DOJ must take the additional steps of empaneling a grand jury and presenting the evidence of her alleged crimes to them.  The grand jury would then vote to \u201ctrue bill\u201d (indict) or \u201cno bill\u201d (not indict) on each of the potential crimes presented.  Usually, a grand jury does what the DOJ wants, but that is more of a factor that grand jury proceedings are one-sided and the DOJ determines what to present rather than the grand jury simply rubber stamping the indictment.  One fact we do not know is whether a grand jury has already been empaneled.  If they are already hearing testimony and reviewing evidence, then the process would be further along. Some of the right-leaning media outlets seem to believe one has been empaneled.  I have not found anything concrete to support their claim but the DOJ will not comment or acknowledge ongoing grand jury proceedings. Another consideration is that I can foresee a disagreement between the prosecutors and the FBI about how to proceed and would expect the prosecutors to prevail.  The FBI\u2019s standard will be probable cause, a fairly low threshold.  However, attorneys involved may have a different idea about how to proceed based on a different standard, which is beyond a reasonable doubt. I expect they will want to go forward only if they are satisfied they have enough to convict Clinton.  That is often a factor in pre-trial decisions.  AG Lynch has said she will accept the recommendations of the FBI and the career prosecutors involved with the investigation, but she will probably defer to the prosecutors if a disagreement exists about how to proceed. The primary reason I am so low on this question has nothing to do with whether, ultimately, Clinton will be indicted, although I lean toward no on that (perhaps another post to explain).  I am low because the grand jury process takes a long time, other ways to resolve the case without an indictment exist, and I expect those who make the decisions will give careful consideration to all the available options.    \n"], [1019, "2016-07-04T11:10:14Z", [0.0], "Intent is the key word for indictment"], [5386, "2016-07-04T08:40:44Z", [0.01], ""], [20364, "2016-07-04T06:03:36Z", [0.05], "IF it hasn't happened by now, it ain't going to happen.

The deleting of emails is troublesome, but legally very difficult to prosecute because Hillary's lawyers did the separating.  Does anyone think Hillary would be dumb enough to just delete emails and hope for the best without thinking it through and getting the best legal advice possible to help her political career while avoiding prosecution?  Hillary may be many things, but she is not dumb.

But to the people in the FBI and intelligence community, he said, that would be \u201cinconceivable.\u201d \u201cThere is going to be a revolt of Watergate proportions if criminal charges do not go forward.\u201d\n. . . \n\u201cFirst of all, the key to this is the private server,\u201d diGenova said. \u201cThe existence of that server and its use by Hillary and her aides in an unencrypted mode, along with all their unencrypted personal devices, is a per se violation of the Espionage Act. It is the failure to properly store, maintain and protect classified information.\u201d \"DiGenova noted the FBI already has established a criminal case against a number of people on that charge, including Gen. David Petraeus, the former director of the CIA. \u201cThe FBI, by virtue of seizing not only Hillary Clinton\u2019s server but also numerous servers at the State Department, has begun to unravel the various communication levels and levels of classification beyond what the State Department is slowly releasing to the public,\u201d he said.  He explained that the FBI is \u201cacting on the basis that the server was set up purposefully to avoid disclosure to the public, the press, the Congress and the courts in response to legitimate legal requests and in response to subpoena.\u201d  \u201cThat establishes the intent necessary for criminal activity, in the area of negligent handling of classified information,\u201d he said. \"DiGenova said the FBI has established a connection between the official acts of Clinton as secretary of state and the speech and fundraising activities of the Clinton Foundation. \"He said he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the FBI has already begun retrieving documents from the Clinton Foundation as its investigation of Hillary Clinton expands into issues of political corruption. \u201cIf I were a U.S. attorney today and this investigation was in my office, I would empanel a grand jury and I would seek charges. This is a no-brainer,\u201d he said.  \u201cThis is a locked case of minimally a violation of the classified information statutes,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are people who have lost their jobs, lost their security clearances, have been convicted of crimes, for leaving a single document out on their desks overnight. \u201cThis case dwarfs, and I underscore dwarfs, the Petraeus case by multiples in the thousand.\"\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  This piece appeared in the Inquisitor, but has been taken down, it seems.   My understanding is that one of the pivotal issues here is intent.  DiGenova says:  \" . .  the FBI is \u201cacting on the basis that the server was set up purposefully to avoid disclosure to the public, the press, the Congress and the courts in response to legitimate legal requests and in response to subpoena.\u201d  If that assumption is not shared by the AG or is not proven, there may be no indictment, as the AG has the option to do nothing. This whole issue is very troubling to me.  If what Clinton was doing was a crime, why was it not stopped immediately?  Why do I keep reading that Colin Powell and Condoleza Rice did the same or very similar?  And if it was a crime, why are they not also being investigated?  Is this just a witch hunt?

Between 1945 and the present according to wikipedia 7 cabinet members were involved in scandals.  Of those 42% were convicted (the others weren't indicted).   Following the rationale from my first post I think that the chance of her being indicted is substantially less because it appears that there was nothing to indict her on in the first 30K of emails that she turned over and then it was reported in January 2016 that the FBI was able to recover the deleted ones.  They have had 4 to 5 months to complete that process and review the emails and still no smoking gun so I am reducing the 42% by 75%.

I made some assumptions to make the calculations easier.  There were 14 presidential terms.  In each term there were 12 (under Truman) to 16 (under obama) cabinet members. During this time 7 cabinet ministers were involved in scandals and 3 were convicted of crimes.  So I calculated my base rate as 3 convictions/14 cabinet members*14 terms= 1.5% Then I considered the specific information that I could find.  1)\tClinton exclusively used her family's private email server for official communications,\n2)\t Charges - violated State Departmentprotocols and procedures, as well as federal laws and regulations governingrecordkeeping. \n3)\tFrom what I could find it seems like there were two main points of contention that Clinton violated FOIA, that known classified information was sent at the time or that information that should have been classified was sent (in violation of the non-disclosure agreement she signed for her security clearance.)\n4)\tClinton turned over about 30,000 emails (about half) and said that the other half were personal and deleted.  She turned over her server and news reports say that the FBI was able to recover deleted emails starting in January 2016. None of the emails so far was classified at the time it was sent.\n5)\tShe has not been charged yet.  If there was a FOIA case to be made I think it would have been made with the 30K emails.  Also no material that was classified at the time was sent.  So that leaves the 30K emails that were deleted, I am thinking that since they have had 4-5 months to recover and review the emails that there were no clear violations reducing the chance that she will be indicted.\n6)\tIt seems like the more difficult to tie down part is the non-disclosure agreement signed by Clinton as part of gaining her security clearance, requires that sensitive information \u2013 and that this can include information received orally, has to be identified and then marked as classified by the sender (ie Clinton) before she sends it.  There are undoubtedly cases where this classification is clear cut but many cases are not.  If this were clear cut it would have already been settled with the original emails.  Again I interpret this as reducing the chance that she will be indicted.\n7) So I don't think there is no chance but I also think it is very unlikely.\n"], [25296, "2016-05-21T23:14:22Z", [0.02], ""], [1646, "2016-05-21T21:43:34Z", [0.02], ""], [38, "2016-05-21T18:48:25Z", [0.22], "What the heck am I doing at 0%?

There are  grounds to indict so she should be indicted. Factor in that the feds strongly believe she should be indicted. Also Republican lobbing powers are substantial to push. Their motivation is strong, while they occupy congress to push for this now especially in an election year with such polarizing candidates. If Hilary and Trump win their party nominations, Hilary will almost certainly carry the most delegate votes after November.  In short there is a huge value to indicting her before the year is out,  and two powerful groups that can and are pushing for this. Btw, I am a Hilary supporter but if I were either the Feds or the Republicans, I'd indict her sooner than later. Also separation of powers which underscores the US constitution leads me to conclude this. The judicial arm has already determined grounds for indictment. Legislative branch has identified, over a hundred plus years of government,  a wide-ranging and (intentionally) vague set of set of situations like this one as acceptable grounds to indict politicians. The President can and, as is his duty, must implement an indictment.  Really, President Obama has no choice in the matter, unless he is willing to ignore his own sense of justice to further the political position of his party. Like I said before, I am a Hilary supporter (especially when the only other option is a Republican government led by Donald) but, under these circumstances, I would have to indict her. As time passes, and she is not indicted, I would suspect President Obama of stalling or even quashing  this to smooth the road for Democrats to win the election. But this means, 1) Obama still has some fight left in him which I don't really believe - the poor guy looks tired and beaten down, and 2) not indicting widens the divide between the executive and legislative parts of government (made up of congress and senators) which is more destabilizing than keeping the status quo (not indicting her yet)  in order to have a smoother election as some on this board have suggested.

And so do all who may have sent a sensitive piece of intelligence to her that she, in turn, might have put on her unclassified system. If Americans at large were briefed on the potential national security implications, they too would care. \"He quotes William Binney, who worked for NSA for 36 years, who, he says \" . . . shares my very strong feelings on the issue. He told me the following:  \u201cThe email issue with Secretary Clinton is one of the most severe compromises of security I have ever known.   This is worse that the compromise of predominantly lower-level data by Bradley (now Chelsea) Manning and gives insight into planning at the highest levels in Washington \u2013 something that even all the torrent of data exposed by Edward Snowden could not provide. Reports that Clinton instructed subordinates to delete the security classification line on sensitive reports and email them to her, suggests a total disregard for the need to protect classified information and arrogance in deeming herself above lawful regulations governing the handling such data. . . . The FBI/Department of Justice would have already indicted lesser officials for less. Certainly, Clinton is receiving special treatment. It is a safe guess that FBI investigators are seething over their inability, so far, to pursue the case against Hillary with the vigor it merits. \"He cites Scott Ritter, \" . . . who served on Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf\u2019s staff during the first Gulf war, before he became chief U.N. weapons inspector for Iraq\" about how easy can be to access private servers.    \"He \". . .  turned to Matthew Hoh, Marine Captain in Iraq and later a senior State Department official in Afghanistan . . . \u201cOrdinary Americans need to know how serious this is\", giving examples of what security breaches might have been able to occur, how that information might be usable as blackmail, and the bad example she was setting for subordinates, and that this \"is an issue that bears on whether she has the character and judgment to be President\". \"In December 2011, when then-Secretary of State Clinton was busy denouncing Pvt. Bradley (now Chelsea) Manning for leaking evidence of U.S. government wrongdoing, Clinton declared: \u201cI think that in an age where so much information is flying through cyberspace, we all have to be aware of the fact that some information which is sensitive, which does affect the security of individuals and relationships, deserves to be protected and we will continue to take necessary steps to do so.\u201d \"For leaking mostly low-level classified information to the public so the people could know about illegal or questionable acts by the government \u2013 none of the data top secret, the level that some Clinton emails have now been stamped \u2013 Manning was sentenced to 35 years in prison. \"But it seems that the applicable legal standard \u2014 or double standard \u2014 is that the more sensitive the security breach and the higher the status of the offender the lighter the punishment. For instance, Gen. David Petraeus divulged top-secret/code-word information to his biographer/mistress and lied to the FBI about it, but received only a misdemeanor citation (a fine and probation but no jail time) for mishandling classified material. \"If that pattern is followed \u2013 and since Secretary of State Clinton outranked Gen. Petraeus \u2013 she might well expect even more lenient treatment, but her behavior might be something that the American voters would want to consider before giving her a promotion to U.S. President.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  This piece is full of speculation about what might have or could have happened--but didn't--as a result of Clinton not using the State Dept email system.

Smith was charged with five felonies, including grossly negligent mishandling of classified information for allowing an FBI informant to obtain highly sensitive bureau information. Smith was having an affair with the informant, Katrina Leung, who was also working for Chinese intelligence. Leung wound up with several FBI documents including a \u201cSecret\u201d memo on Chinese fugitives and an unclassified FBI phone directory. She said she regularly took documents from Smith\u2019s briefcase, which he often left open when he visited her. In a plea deal, Smith pleaded guilty to a single felony count of lying to investigators. He was sentenced to three months house arrest, three years probation and a $10,000 fine. \" . . .former senior State Department official, Don Keyser, pled guilty in 2005 to felony charges of removing government records as well as lying to investigators and lying on a Customs Declaration. A search found 3,659 classified documents at Keyser\u2019s home: 1,976 of them \u201cSecret\u201d and 28 \u201cTop Secret,\u201d as well as 28 floppy disks containing more \u201cSecret\u201d documents. Keyser\u2019s wife said she alerted him to the presence of the classified materials but he apparently never sought to return them. The removal-of-records charge Keyser admitted to is one some conservative lawyers have urged be leveled at Clinton. It does not require that the documents in question be classified. However, the government\u2019s reason for concern in Keyser\u2019s case went beyond his storage of classified info at home: undercover FBI agents twice observed him in a car having what appeared to be intimate contact with a Taiwanese intelligence agent, Isabelle Cheng. The longtime diplomat also lied about his relationship with Cheng and took classified information on an unreported trip to Taiwan. Keyser was ultimately sentenced to a year and a day in prison and a $25,000 fine. The lead prosecutor on the Keyser case, David Laufman, is now the head of the Justice Department\u2019s counterintelligence section \u2014 the office believed to be overseeing the FBI probe into Clinton\u2019s server.   \"A Boeing engineer who took home what prosecutors called \u201can adult giraffe\u201d \u2019s-worth of sensitive information on missile defense programs, Abraham Lesnik, pled guilty in 2008 to a felony charge of unauthorized retention of classified data.\nLesnik\u2019s travel and ties to Israel appear to have been a factor, but prosecutors said they had no evidence he planned to misuse the roughly 2000 classified documents, including about 400 marked top secret found on a thumb drive, laptop and other devices at his California home and in a storage locker. Lesnik\u2019s lawyer argued vehemently that no criminal charges should have been brought in the case. Prosecutors asked for a four-year prison sentence. A judge gave the scientist three years\u2019 probation. \"The toughest punishment handed down in recent memory for mishandling classified information went to former National Security Agency analyst Kenneth Ford Jr., who was sentenced in 2006 to six years in prison for taking to his home two boxes of classified documents and other records from NSA headquarters in Maryland. He was also convicted of lying on a job application form. \"A contract linguist working for the Navy in Bahrain, James Hitselberger, was hit with six felony charges after being seen taking classified printouts to his room and cutting the headings off classified records. Hitselberger appears to have fueled investigators\u2019 suspicions by sending some classified records to archives at Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution and by disappearing in Europe after being dismissed from his job in the Persian Gulf. In a plea deal, Hitselberger pled guilty to misdemeanor mishandling of classified records. He was sentenced to time served: two months in jail and eight months on house arrest. Some have compared Hitselberger cutting headings off the classified documents to a message Clinton sent to a top aide in June 2011, telling him to work around a broken secure fax machine by editing a classified \u2018talking points\u2019 document and sending it over ordinary email. \u201cIf they can't, turn into nonpaper [with] no identifying heading and send nonsecure,\" Clinton wrote. State Department officials have said there\u2019s no evidence the aide, Jake Sullivan, ever sent the talking points via email. Republicans said the episode showed Clinton\u2019s disregard for the security of classified information, but other former officials said the incident was benign and that anonymizing information is a routine way of handling such information in unclassified channels.\n~~~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  The piece concludes:\n\" . . . .some of those felony charges for grossly negligent handling or removal of classified information appear to have been pursued in cases where the government strongly suspected espionage or deliberate leaking of classified information had occurred, but decided a full-blown prosecution on those grounds wasn\u2019t warranted.
