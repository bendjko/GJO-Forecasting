Why all the backing and filling? Quite probably the more ambitious claims were made by suits in the C suite and then walked back by engineers in the lab. The original big, fat promise, by Brin [Waymo's CEO], was certainly in line with Silicon Valley business culture, which is to talk big and apologize later, if at all. https://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/self-driving/the-year-in-robocars Dateline 1-4-2018  Actual self-driving cars\u2014with no one behind the wheel\u2014will enter commercial service in 2018. You may now exhale. Yes, it\u2019s true, but here\u2019s the caveat: The service will be severely circumscribed. At most, we\u2019ll see robocars serving as taxis in certain well-mapped suburbs. At least, we\u2019ll see passenger-free robocars that reposition themselves by night so that commuters can have access to them come morning. But that\u2019s still what experts call Level 4 autonomy. Here\u2019s the hierarchy: At Level 5, a car can do it all. At Level 4, the car does it all only in certain areas, under certain conditions. At Level 3, drivers must be prepared to take control after a 10-second warning. At Level 2, they must pay attention all the time. Level 1 helps with the braking. Level 0 has power windows. Level 2 is available now from GM. Level 3 is supposedly possible for Audi\u2019s newly unveiled A8, at least when the safety regulators in your city say so. And Level 4 is just about every car company\u2019s goal\u2014for 2021. True, in early November Waymo took the big step of removing the safety driver from behind the wheel of its ride-hailing robocar service near Phoenix, Ariz.\u2014only to plonk that driver down in the back seat, just in case. And even that program is still free of charge to only a select group of subscribing riders and therefore more of a demo than a real business proposition. -- https://spectrum.ieee.org/transportation/self-driving/the-first-fully-commercial-robocar-will-be-in-holland"], [5018, "2018-01-23T14:29:01Z", [0.5], ""], [13377, "2018-01-23T14:01:39Z", [0.0], "Too many accidents thanks to defective autopilot, self driving vehicles.

Avis is already working with AMAZON ALEXA, ALexa and Google HOME, are selling well, Google a device per second since October. Of course we have phones too. Everything seems to be moving lockstep.  Waymo seems to be moving in 6 month increments, I'd guess MAY 1st. There are no legislative barriers to impede this date in Arizona but there is  A trial WAYMO vs UBER: https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/4609586/waymo-llc-v-uber-technologies-inc/?filed_after=&filed_before=&entry_gte=&entry_lte=&order_by=desc  This indicates a February Jury trial standing between now and July. Allegedly UBER stole trade secrets and I can imagine reverse liability if WAYMO went to market with this loose string left untied.  I think Google has a great chance to win. APPLE just rewon versus Samsung in November and WAYMO's parent company has the money to sustain appeals which should push the trial in WAYMOS direction  so I think there are huge amounts of tech, economic, demand and courts momenta to push this through by July.\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/28/technology/uber-waymo-lawsuit.html\nhttp://ir.avisbudgetgroup.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=1031344\nhttp://ir.avisbudgetgroup.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=1047813\nhttp://files.shareholder.com/downloads/ABEA-36XVJR/5830382640x0x964515/00E93506-3820-43C3-80F1-EAD08AD70AFA/CAR-USQ_Transcript_2017-11-15_4_.pdf\nhttps://www.courtlistener.com/docket/4609586/waymo-llc-v-uber-technologies-inc/?filed_after=&filed_before=&entry_gte=&entry_lte=&order_by=desc\nhttps://www.courtlistener.com/docket/4609586/1/waymo-llc-v-uber-technologies-inc/"], [46786, "2018-01-06T05:41:50Z", [0.02], ""], [45494, "2018-01-06T03:51:11Z", [0.75], "Waymo shows steady progress in the software and has market pressure to do this test.

One hitch I have with the question is exactly what a \"driverless transportation service\" is -- Waymo is already offering rides for free in Chandler, just outside of (or part of?) Phoenix, according to its Medium page and Ars Technica.  I'm assuming that the question means a pay-for-service arrangement.  That is, will Waymo offer to the public a service whereby riders pay to be taken from one place to another by a driverless car?  I look at 1 July 2018 as promising.  However, my answer would be much higher, probably close to 80%, if the question were regarding all of 2018 - that is, until 1 January 2019.

Waymo has already been providing limited rides to the public since August during its initial beta test. There will likely be limits to the service offered; geolocation fencing and weather restrictions being some examples. I believe that permission will be granted sometime next Spring. Waymo has already signed agreements with Carmax and Avis as maintenance and automobile providers. Potential barriers to full approval include (1) unanticipated accidents/malfunctions involving the AI or sensors or (2) unanticipated issues with the cars. Indeed, the Chrysler Pacific minivan (which Waymo is currently using) has had several reports of sudden engine shut off. If this problem is not resolved quickly, Waymo may be forced to redesign their fleet using another car, which may require AI reprogramming, potentially delaying the public launch. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/20/business/chrysler-pacifica.html?hpw&rref=automobiles&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=well-region&region=bottom-well&WT.nav=bottom-well"], [19801, "2017-11-22T04:15:03Z", [0.75], "Waymo CEO John Krafick shared the company\u2019s milestone during a speech Tuesday at the Lisbon Web Summit.

Is there legislation prohibiting the driverless transportation? I found out that in 2017 33 states have introduced legislation. Last year, 20 states introduced legislation. (ncsl.org) National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has a vision 2.0 for automated safety tech. In The next years there should be partially automated safety features. In 2025+ there would be fully automatized such as highway pilot. But this discusses only about safety feature. But so far whenever reading about this topic it is \"safety first\" perspective in all of these articles. Few weeks ago I joined for travel safety webinar and there was a discussion about self-driving cars. The expert told that the technology is doing well, but there's a problem putting those automated cars in the streets with cars with drivers. So it would require a huge turn-up in regulations to diminish the regular cars. I believe that the near future is about driver assistant auto-piloting, but the totally driverless cars won't happen in terms of regulation. At least not in wide scope. BUT I think there is still chance for trials! In Finland we have had driverless transportation in trade show areas past years. It was also mentioned in the introduction that there has already been a trial in Arizona. So if Waymo makes it, it will most like be a trial. The open-to-public service will not be a sort of taxi service. Rather a short distance between A to B. Still it would be counted regarding the layout of the question that lies here. So in the end I would give it quite a high percentage of change to occur 75% but still leaving 25% not happening.
