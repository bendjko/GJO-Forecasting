Netanyahu had held long conversations with both presidents to ensure this outcome. With such a strong showing abroad, why is he feeling vulnerable at home? There are two storm clouds on his horizon.

They\u2019re ready to take a bullet for him. The victim effect serves him very well. His popularity transcends the party, let alone its base. The polls look good. In every foreseeable constellation he\u2019ll be Israel\u2019s next prime minister. The temptation of moving up the general election exists, all the time. In March he toyed with the idea of holding it in June, because of the furor around legislation involving the draft of the ultra-Orthodox, or Haredim. In May, with the tempest over the bill that would allow the Knesset to override the Supreme Court, it was reported that he was considering dissolving the Knesset and holding an election on September 4 (the only Tuesday of that month that doesn\u2019t coincide with a Jewish holiday). Now it turns out that those considerations assumed a practical turn. About a month ago, an envoy of the prime minister told a certain interlocutor that Netanyahu indeed wanted to hold the general election in September, which would mean postponing the municipal elections from the end of October until early next year. At Netanyahu\u2019s request, an expert opinion was drawn up elaborating the legal, economic, political and intraparty implications of putting off the municipal elections. With or without connection to that document, the premier again changed his mind. The change in dates, and the expert opinion, were shelved. Possibly the reservations of his coalition allies deterred him, or perhaps the security tensions in the south and the north imbued him with a greater sense of responsibility. Or maybe there was a different reason, something mysterious that transcends rationality and slides into the realm of conspiracy, malice and intrigue. With Netanyahu, that\u2019s what usually tips the balance. Inevitably, the options for the general election date are dwindling. In two weeks the Knesset will break for two and a half months, reconvening in mid-October. The assessment of all the coalition partners is that the next election will be held no later than next February or March . . .  Sources close to the prime minister are already imagining the next government, which will likely be Netanyahu\u2019s fifth. This time, they say, he\u2019ll opt for a cabinet based on the broadest possible coalition. . . . After the next election, assuming that the numbers more or less match the opinion polls, it will be clear already from the exit polls that he and he alone will be the next prime minister. In addition to his natural allies in the current coalition, Yesh Atid and Labor/Zionist Union will be frothing at the mouth to grab a slice of the new government. Yesh Atid leader Yapir Lapid doesn\u2019t have the energy for another stint in the opposition. That\u2019s so obvious as to be pitiable. He\u2019s tired of his three-year fantasy of \u201cbeing foreign minister.\u201d He craves the real thing. His youthful dream of succeeding Netanyahu vanished in the smoke of the recent security events, including tensions in Syria, the Gaza Strip, etc. Lapid has returned to his natural proportions and is preparing for life itself: the foreign affairs portfolio in Netanyahu\u2019s fifth government.\n. . . \nThe advantage Netanyahu will reap from a broad coalition is obvious: No party will be able to dislodge him. Anyone who\u2019s not happy can pack up and leave. Second, his hated rivals on the right from Habayit Hayehudi \u2013 Education Minister Naftali Bennett and Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked \u2013 will be dwarfed or liquidated altogether. . . .  Third, bringing Yesh Atid and Labor, or one of them, into the government will give the premier more maneuver room regarding the \u201cdeal of the century\u201d that the Trump administration intends to put on the regional agenda in the coming months. Netanyahu would like to see the plan submitted after the election in Israel to avoid mixing diplomatic-political issues into a campaign that, as far as he\u2019s concerned, will focus on three themes: security, security and security. But in terms of the broad coalition he\u2019s said to be planning, what Netanyahu mainly has in mind is the day the attorney general decides, if he does, to put him on trial after a prior hearing. The minimalist assessment is that the process won\u2019t end before late 2019. We saw how the decision in Sara Netanyahu\u2019s simple fraud case was dragged out. A prime minister isn\u2019t obliged by law to resign if indicted. Petitions will be filed with the High Court of Justice requesting that the precedents of Arye Dery and Rafael Pinhasi, two ministers who were forced to resign after being indicted, be applied to Netanyahu as well. He will likely want to wait until the judges decide. He\u2019ll need the agreement of his coalition partners. It\u2019ll be more convenient if one of them is from the left \u2013 a \u201ckosher certificate\u201d for the High Court and a shield with respect to the public.\n. .  .\nTo prepare the ground, Netanyahu is out to remove obstacles and land mines. He\u2019s urging his coalition partners to hurry and enact the conscription legislation and the nation-state bill already in this Knesset session, which is rapidly drawing to a close \u2013 and if not in the next two weeks, then at the beginning of the winter session in October-November. That will guarantee that in the next coalition negotiations, both laws will already be on the books and won\u2019t make it difficult for parties from the \u201cless obvious\u201d camp to join the government. To that end, he sent his discreet problem solver, Tourism Minister Yariv Levin, to speak to the leaders of the coalition parties and reach agreements on a more moderate version of the nation-state legislation. With the draft law things are more complicated. Netanyahu, Shas leader Dery, MK Moshe Gafni from the Degel Hatorah faction of United Torah Judaism, Lieberman and Kahlon all want to be rid of this nuisance \u2013 fast. But Health Minister Yaakov Litzman, from the Agudat Yisrael faction of UTJ, aims to postpone it for as long as possible. He\u2019s concerned that if the legislation reaches its final stages, his extremist rabbis, whose connection with reality isn\u2019t clear, will force him and the other UTJ MKs to vote against it and resign. He\u2019d rather the Knesset dissolved itself on its own.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  I've kept my forecast higher than many other forecasters because I thought Netanyahu might call an early election.

He is now trying to push a quick law that would lower that threshold. The Netanyahu survival plan begins with elections in the second half of 2018. He is convinced that if all his partners cross the threshold, a fifth victory that would equal David Ben-Gurion\u2019s record is assured. The centre-left is too divided and devoid of a credible leader to challenge him. He believes elections would also pre-empt the Attorney General\u2019s decision on the corruption cases and make it much more difficult for a judicial official to challenge an elected leader with a renewed mandate. Mr Netanyahu is laying down a compelling argument for the Israeli public: If you vote for me and my coalition, how can the police, the attorneys and the media take me down? That would be a coup. In principle, no one stands above the law. Israel\u2019s courts have demonstrated this by sending a prime minister and a president to prison in the past decade. But this time Mr Netanyahu is convinced it will be different. He won\u2019t resign because of police recommendations, not even if he is indicted. He is prepared, he has told allies, to fight this through the courts while in office, convinced he can prove there was nothing illegal in accepting gifts from \u201cclose personal friends\u201d and that the favourable coverage was his due as a successful leader. Why not investigate why other news organisations have been unfairly criticising him? Mr Netanyahu knows the Attorney General well. He was his cabinet secretary for three years. The last thing Avichai Mandelblit wants is to provoke a constitutional crisis and be remembered as the civil servant who brought down an elected prime minister. Previous attorneys general were just as hesitant: Elyakim Rubinstein did not press charges on Mr Netanyahu in the Hebron-Bar-On case, nor did Menny Mazuz on Ariel Sharon over the Greek island bribery investigation. Other prime ministers \u2014 Yitzhak Rabin in 1977 and Ehud Olmert in 2008 \u2014 had been weak and resigned before they could be indicted. But this is not a weak prime minister: he outlasted Barack Obama and can hold out against the Attorney General. If Mr Mandelblit perseveres, then let them come, Bibi will say. It will be the people against the elites, a leader who won five democratic elections in defiance of the hostile media and plans to remain in office for many years to come, despite the \u2018deep state\u2019.

In a conversation with Al-Monitor, one senior Likud minister said Netanyahu has finally internalized the idea that if he drags his coalition partners into an election against their will, he could very well pay a steep price for it on \u201cthe day after.\u201d They could decide to get back at him and refuse to join his next coalition. In this context, the Likud is also taking heed of the latest political threat facing Netanyahu. The new party being formed by independent Knesset member Orly Levy-Abekasis is soaring in the polls. It now looks like the former Yisrael Beitenu member could wind up holding the balance of power, and it is not at all certain that she would give Netanyahu her support. According to Zionist Camp Knesset member Omer Barlev, the working assumption in his party is that a new election could be called at any given moment, so they are preparing accordingly. \u201cThis will be a session with a lot of tension and disquiet. No one knows if Netanyahu has decided to call early elections . . .  . . .  two particularly volatile new bills . . .  could bring down the government and lead to new elections. The first is the proposed law to circumvent the Supreme Court, also known as the override clause. The legislation, which is aggressively being pushed by the leaders of HaBayit HaYehudi, Education Minister Naftali Bennett and Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked, would allow the Knesset to override Supreme Court decisions overturning laws. This would constitute nothing less than a fundamental change in the relationship between the legislative and judicial branches of government, and is something that the left and Supreme Court justices consider to be a brutal and malicious attack on the rule of law. Over the last week, the Zionist Camp has been leading a campaign, including demonstrations, to protect the Supreme Court as part of overall preparations for a new election cycle. Netanyahu recently threw his support behind the new legislation out of concern that he might otherwise lose votes from the right to Bennett. That's why he met in his office April 29 with the president of the Supreme Court, Justice Esther Hayut. The two-hour meeting, which was intended to bridge the differences between the two sides, was also attended by Shaked. It was later described by a government official as \u201ca serious and in-depth conversation in which views were exchanged.\u201d Meanwhile, Bennett and Shaked have been signaling that they plan to go all the way with this law. In contrast, the chairman of Kulanu, Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon, is doing what he can to block it. It is not clear yet what Netanyahu will do. Will he align himself with them, or will he choose to side with Kahlon and use this as grounds for a coalition crisis that will lead to new elections? At this stage, the second option seems less likely, because Netanyahu believes that it could harm him electorally. It therefore seems likely that he will try to find a compromise formula, with the help of Hayut. The risk of paying a political price is what caused Netanyahu to shelve his plan to deport asylum-seekers just hours after he announced April 2 that an agreement had been reached with the United Nations on the matter. The override clause is a continuation of this process, since it was intended, among other things, to prevent the Supreme Court from overruling laws concerning people who have entered the country illegally. Another piece of legislation that is thought to have the potential to bring about a major coalition crisis is the proposed conversion law. As Danny Zaken reported for Al-Monitor, this contentious bill will soon be brought before the Cabinet for discussion. The Yisrael Beitenu chairman, Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman, is demanding that recognition of conversions to Judaism be expanded to include those made under progressive Jewish institutions despite harsh opposition from ultra-Orthodox parties. As the Knesset prepares to begin its summer session, it also appears that both sides also seem interested in finding a compromise on this issue. While the election pendulum is currently swinging back in the direction of continuing the current coalition, the situation could change in the blink of an eye. That would be the result of how much Netanyahu really wants to blow everything up and hold new elections before Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit releases his decision regarding the ongoing criminal investigations of Netanyahu. As far as Netanyahu is concerned, all options are on the table. The predominant assessment in the coalition is that the decision will be made in the next two weeks. Many in Israel are talking about \u201cMay Madness,\u201d because of all the major events taking place that could cause a rapid deterioration of the security situation. These include the increasingly likely decision by US President Donald Trump to nullify or change the nuclear agreement with Iran on May 12, and the relocation of the US Embassy to Jerusalem on May 14. As far as Netanyahu is concerned, these two events are welcome politically, even if they are particularly volatile from a security perspective. On the evening of April 29, news was circulating in Israel that Trump himself is considering attending the ceremony to mark the moving of the US Embassy, and that he might even allow Jonathan Pollard, a convicted spy, to come to Israel. Netanyahu could not hope for better news than that. Add the cancellation of the Iran nuclear deal and Netanyahu has a winning hand with his electorate on the right. The relationship between Israel and the United States is thriving, and it could reach a whole new high point in May. This could cause the election pendulum to swing back and get Netanyahu to take advantage of the momentum by calling an election. On the other hand, in this case, too, the considerations come with considerable complexity. Netanyahu will wait to see if the \u201crenaissance\u201d in Israel\u2019s relationship with the United States will lead to some conflagration or other on the security front. Only when this part of the puzzle is solved will he be able to reassess the early election scenario. Within all these considerations, Netanyahu will have to add his legal woes and assess how close \u2014 or how far \u2014 he might be from a decision to indict him. While the indictment \u201cforecast\u201d has not been in the headlines for the past few weeks, the team investigating Netanyahu is still hard at work. Regardless of what ultimately happens, the election pendulum should be gathering momentum over the month of May. The general feeling among the coalition partners is that if elections are not called by the end of the month, the coalition will survive for many more months to come.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  Here's my take-away from this article: \"the election pendulum should be gathering momentum over the month of May.

Or should he escape, using it as an excuse to call an election?  Last week, Netanyahu chose flight [calling an early election], and this week, signs show he may go that way once again. When the prime minister announced that he reached an agreement with the Office of the UN High Commission for Refugees to keep half of the Eritrean and Sudanese migrants in Israel, and have the other half absorbed in other countries by the UNHCR, his base exploded. He was attacked from the Right by members of his own party, and even worse, as far as Netanyahu is concerned, by Bayit Yehudi leader Naftali Bennett. Even Kulanu head Moshe Kahlon, considered to be more of a moderate, said the plan was too weak. The general right-wing criticism of the plan is that it would leave too many migrants who are not recognized as refugees living in Israel, specifically in the poorer neighborhoods of south Tel Aviv. So Netanyahu put the agreement on hold within hours, and the next morning he announced the plan is off. Now, it seems, the focus is on deporting as many migrants as possible. The problem \u2013 aside from the moral issues \u2013 is that the Supreme Court overturned the government\u2019s earlier plan to deport all single male adult migrants this month, citing poor efforts to check the applications of those who seek refugee status, and third countries, like Rwanda, not properly absorbing them upon arrival. BUT THIS coalition is nothing if not creative. The parties want to bring back an old workaround passed by prime minister Yitzhak Rabin\u2019s government for Shas in 1993, when the Supreme Court overturned the law against breeding pigs, a non-kosher animal, saying it violates Basic Law: Freedom of Occupation. An article was included in the Basic Law that says \u201ca provision of a law that violates freedom of occupation shall be of effect... if it has been included in a law passed by a majority of the members of Knesset... Such law shall expire four years from its commencement.\u201d In short, if a law violates Basic Law: Freedom of Occupation, the Knesset can vote it back in as a temporary measure. Kahlon says he would agree to a narrow version of the workaround that would only apply to the migrant issue. Opponents of judicial activism have sought to pass such a provision that would apply to all Supreme Court rulings canceling laws, and, in fact, there is such a bill submitted to the Knesset by Bayit Yehudi MK Bezalel Smotrich, which Bennett and Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked are trying to promote. But Netanyahu clearly doesn\u2019t want to be attacked from the Right by Bennett yet again, on the same issue, so he wants to bring his own bill. The prime minister has stopped similar Supreme Court-circumventing bills more than once in the past, but this time, Netanyahu needs to look right-wing, or he\u2019ll suffer electorally. So after days of considering that provision, Netanyahu and the Likud decided to take it a step further, and now want to take away the Supreme Court\u2019s ability to overturn laws in the first place. Looking right-wing enough is a major concern for Netanyahu, because now is a convenient time for him to call an early election, and the migrant issue is a handy excuse. As a senior minister said Wednesday: \u201cI think he wants an election. When he wants the broad workaround provision, it ensures Kahlon will oppose it... and then he\u2019ll have someone to blame. It\u2019s another reason for an election, together with the [haredi] conscription and conversion bills,\u201d which are on the agenda for the coming months and a cause for coalition infighting. Why would Netanyahu want to call an election now? The same reasons he tried to disperse the Knesset when the issue was haredi enlistment in the IDF, but was foiled by his coalition partners. The prime minister hopes to be reelected before Attorney-General Avichai Mandelblit makes a decision on the cases in which the police recommended Netanyahu be indicted on corruption charges. In a few months, the situation can drastically change. The timing is also good for Netanyahu, because there are currently big security issues on the public agenda, regarding Iran and Syria, which usually play to his favor, politically. So between fighting to deport migrants, or running away from his problems in hopes of getting a boost of encouragement from the voting public, the scales look like they\u2019re tipping toward the latter, while making it look like he\u2019s doing the former.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  My takeaway from this article:  \"Looking right-wing enough is a major concern for Netanyahu, because now is a convenient time for him to call an early election, and the migrant issue is a handy excuse.

Israelis continue to back their leader \u2013 and it's not because they believe he is innocent of the charges against him.\n. . . The prime minister has a mostly right-wing base of supporters and many of them, analysts say, simply believe that all politicians are corrupt, and favor their leader over any alternative. After serving more than a decade as Israel's prime minister, Netanyahu has managed to persuade enough of the electorate that he is both statesmanlike and that he represents the everyman against the elites. In that sense, Netanyahu . . .  belong[s] to the rising populist trend in many Western democracies. . . . . Additionally, in both Israel and the U.S., partisan politics is a more powerful force than allegations of wrongdoing . . . According to the latest Peace Index, a monthly poll conducted by Tel Aviv University and the Israel Democracy Institute, 42 percent of Israeli Jews say the prime minister should not resign, even if he is indicted by the attorney general. The same poll found that 59 percent do not believe Netanyahu's claim that \"There will be nothing because there is nothing.\" Arab-Israelis, meanwhile, are less forgiving: 69 percent believe he should resign if he is indicted, and 79 percent do not believe his claims of innocence. According to Israeli law, the prime minister is not required to resign if he is indicted \u2013 only if he is then convicted in a court of law. This has never happened, because previous prime ministers accused of corruption resigned before they could be indicted. Yet just as the investigations into Netanyahu have widened, so has his lead over his challengers. In nearly a dozen opinion polls conducted in March, his ruling Likud party emerged victorious over every opposition party, sometimes with double-digit leads. The next Israeli elections are scheduled for November 2019.  The attorney general is expected to take at least six months to reach a decision on whether to indict Netanyahu. This could bring two firsts in Israeli history: the country may have an indicted prime minister serving in office and, alternating between campaigning and appearing in court as he runs for another term. Even Israel's president has hinted that Netanyahu should step down if he's indicted, pointing to Netanyahu's own words in 2008, when he called for the resignation of then-Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who faced the same charges Netanyahu faces now. Netanyahu enjoys continued public support because of several characteristics of his leadership, some of them contradictory. Many Israelis see Netanyahu as the only politician who possesses the worldly sophistication and statesmanship necessary to represent Israel on the global stage. At the same time, his largely right-wing base views him as an underdog up against the left-wing elites who led the country before him. \"Netanyahu has succeeded in painting himself as the representative of the people,\" says Rahat. Yet since he has been in power so long, \"He's also succeeded in making himself seem irreplaceable.\" The prime minister also has persuaded the public of his vigilance on national security and being the only Israeli leader capable of standing up to Israel's enemies around the world, says Dahlia Scheindlin, an independent Israeli pollster and political strategist. \"The perception among Israelis is that the world is never going to like what we do and Netanyahu stands up to them and advances our interests in the face of that.\" Netanyahu's supporters also see the allegations against him as relatively trivial, says Tamar Hermann, co-editor of the monthly Peace Index and senior fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute. \"They think there was something there, but not necessarily something that should force him to resign.\"\n. . . \nNetanyahu, like Trump, has portrayed the investigations against him as a witch hunt. This tactic, analysts say, has helped him hold on to his base. \"Many people in Israel think that this is a conspiracy of the old elites against him, that this is a political matter, and that the left is working with the attorney general and with the police to topple him,\" says Hermann. Though Netanyahu's base is strong, it's far from representing Israel as a whole. His approval is high among right-wing voters, but extremely low among the left.

It appears that the difference this time is that the offenses that Netanyahu is accused of are more serious, involving allegations of receiving a million shekels worth of favors, and in Case 2000, allegations of a deal that would have delivered a major blow to freedom of the Israeli press.  The police recommendations now must be considered by Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit. What is expected of him at the moment is to decide as quickly as possible rather than deliberating endlessly in the lead-up to zero hour and a decision on whether to indict.\"\nhttps://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-this-time-netanyahu-can-t-hide-from-the-allegations-against-him-1.5821233 \"...It is not the police\u2019s job to decide whether or not Netanyahu should be indicted. Our legal system makes a clear distinction between the role of the police, which is to investigate and gather evidence, and the state attorney and the attorney-general, who are empowered to decide whether the evidence and testimony is strong enough to prove wrongdoing on the part of the prime minister.  Indeed, it is questionable whether the police, who have no power to indict, should be allowed to publicize their recommendations at all. Allowing them to might be beneficial in cases where they exonerate a suspect. But the down side of publicizing police recommendations is that it prematurely decides the fate of potentially innocent persons. If police recommendations do not lead to an indictment, this could undermine the public\u2019s trust in the police. This is not the first time police have recommended indicting Netanyahu for bribery and breach of trust....Will this time be different? It is too early to tell. But it is clear that a police recommendation to indict does not necessarily mean that the state attorney or the attorney-general will agree with the police, or that an indictment will lead to conviction.\"\nhttp://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Presumed-innocent-542675 \"...Although Mr Netanyahu has blamed the left and the news media of plotting to oust him by legal means because they cannot beat him at the ballot box, Mr Mandelblit hardly fits the profile of a politically motivated insurgent intent on bringing down the government, often described as the most right-wing and religious in Israel's history.  On the contrary, Mr Mandelblit, who has closely followed the police investigations all along, has been accused of dragging his feet to stall them. What started as small, weekly demonstrations on Saturday nights outside Mr Mandelblit's house in the city of Petah Tikva, east of Tel Aviv, recently grew into several mass rallies in Tel Aviv against corruption and what many of the protesters saw as procrastination by the authorities....\"\nhttp://www.straitstimes.com/world/middle-east/israeli-pms-choice-for-a-g-to-decide-on-filing-charges \"...About half of Israelis want Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to step down over allegations of corruption, but the popularity of his ruling Likud party has been largely unaffected by police recommendations to indict him, a pair of polls released Wednesday showed.  ...A day after police published detailed criminal graft allegations in two separate cases, recommending the prime minister be indicted, 50 percent of respondents told a Channel 10 news poll Netanyahu should resign or declare his incapacity, while 42% said he should continue to serve as premier.  A separate poll for Hadashot news showed 48% of respondents calling for Netanyahu to step down while 36% said he should not.   The numbers were a significant retreat from a similar poll in late December published by Hadashot, in which 60% said Netanyahu should resign if police recommend bribery charges and 28% thought he should stay on.  ...Wednesday\u2019s polls also testified to continuing support for Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party as well as gains for rival Yesh Atid.  A Channel 10 survey said Likud would win 27 Knesset seats if fresh elections were held, while a Hadashot TV news poll put the party at 26 seats.  Those numbers are similar to other polls in recent months, but down from the party\u2019s current total of 30 seats of the Knesset\u2019s 120. \"...Netanyahu can remain in power even if he is indicted, according to Israeli law. Analysts believe it may take a year or longer before Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit decides whether to indict Netanyahu on any or all of the suggested charges.

No party has reason to rock the boat, and no party will gain from having a new election. In fact, the opposite is true: Most of the parties can only lose. They lose if they have to renegotiate what they already have \u2014 because of a similar election outcome. They lose if they have to contend with a less friendly, less coherent coalition. So for the time being, while the attorney general ponders Netanyahu\u2019s legal future, the prime minister seems politically safe.  It is impossible to know at this stage if Netanyahu\u2019s coalition can survive until the regularly scheduled elections two years from now. The attorney general is expected to decide on Netanyahu\u2019s case by the middle of this year. The prime minister could decide to pre-empt such a decision if he were to call for a new election and get re-elected. After all, in such a scenario he would be elected when the public would already be aware of his supposed crimes and would still want him as its leader. Preempting the legal process could mean a decision on a new election in early spring, and the actual vote in early 2019....\"\nhttp://jewishjournal.com/rosnersdomain/230810/is-bibi-in-trouble/ \"Police are recommending charges of bribery and breach of trust against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He\u2019s saying the case police have made is 'full of holes, like Swiss cheese.' Netanyahu may want the public to recall how earlier corruption probes against him, in his first stint as prime minister, went nowhere, and how those against two of his successors, Ehud Barak and Ariel Sharon, also petered out.  In 2009, then-Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman faced charges of bribery, fraud, money laundering, witness harassment and obstruction of justice, but was acquitted at trial. Israelis have long complained that drawn-out investigations, often leaked to the media, have undercut politicians and their right to due process. History may not be kind to Netanyahu\u2019s cheese metaphor, however: There are a dozen or so cabinet-level figures in Israel who similarly dismissed charges against them, only to find themselves in a different kind of hole. Many were given suspended sentences:\n     Ehud Olmert, prime minister - Olmert resigned his post in September 2008 after police investigators recommended that he be indicted in multiple corruption scandals. What he said: 'Every intelligent person knows that things are totally out of proportion.' What he served: 16 months of a 27-month sentence for receiving bribes in what was called the largest corruption scandal in Israel....\n     Moshe Katsav, president - Katsav, charged with raping one woman and sexually harassing two other staffers, resigned in 2007 after reaching a plea bargain. The rape charges were dropped. He would plead guilty to sexual harassment and obstruction of justice among other charges and receive a suspended sentence. What he said, in 2006: 'The press is leading the public pressure. Sometimes their actions even border on criminal, when false testimony is given because of the [media] pressure. Hostile media sources reached out to many young women.' What he served: Five years of a seven-year sentence for rape and the other charges....\n     Gonen Segev, energy minister - Segev, a doctor, was a member of the hawkish opposition Tzomet party who was lured across the aisle in 1994 to join Yitzhak Rabin\u2019s government as energy minister and to deliver the crucial vote that approved the Oslo Accords with the Palestinians.  In 2004, he was arrested for drug smuggling and credit card fraud. He had attempted to smuggle in 25,000 Ecstasy tablets from the Netherlands. What he said: He thought they were M&Ms.  What he served: More than two years of a five-year sentence. He was released in 2007.\n     Shlomo Benizri, health and energy minister - Benizri, of the Sephardi Orthodox Shas party, served as a health minister under a Labor Party government from 1999 to 2001 and then as labor minister under Likud governments from 2001 to 2003. He was charged in 2008 with accepting bribes, breach of public trust and obstruction of justice for actions during his stint as labor minister. He had provided inside information to a contractor friend.  What his brother said: It was the gays\u2019 fault. \u201cThe entire system has tuned Shlomo Benizri into its target,\u201d David Benizri said when his brother was convicted. \u201cHe was a man who wasn\u2019t afraid to say what we, as religious Jews, did not dare utter. There are a lot of gays in the courts, the Knesset, the police and the State Prosecution, and I guess many Jews in the law enforcement system did not like to hear the truth.\u201d  What he served: Benizri appealed an 18-month sentence in 2008; the High Court increased the term to four years in 2009. He served 2 1/2 years and was released in March 2012 in part because of overcrowding in Israeli prisons.\n     Aryeh Deri, interior minister - Deri, the Shas leader, was the interior minister from 1988 to 1993, under national unity, Likud and Labor-led governments. He was charged with multiple counts of corruption relating to using his position heading the Interior Ministry, which oversees local councils, to get towns and cities to dispense favors to friends and associates.  What his rabbi said: God was protecting him. Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, the former Sephardic chief rabbi and the spiritual leader of Shas, called Deri to his apartment in 1993 and instructed him not to step down. Yosef said Deri\u2019s \u201cenemies will fall before him\u201d because Deri \u201cis guarded by angels.\u201d  What he served: Deri was sentenced to three years in 2000; he was released after 22 months in 2002.\nhttps://www.timesofisrael.com/5-times-israeli-politicians-said-theres-nothing-to-it-and-ended-up-in-jail/ \"...Some of those who are now celebrating will miss Netanyahu\u2019s days. The days ahead may be darker; it\u2019s possible: a prime minister worse than Netanyahu. All those who saw the struggle to remove Netanyahu as the be all and end all \u2013 let\u2019s just get rid of him and everything will be wonderful as it once was \u2013 will discover that everything may still blow up in their faces.  So the rejoicing over Netanyahu\u2019s demise is premature, and more to the point exaggerated. An Israel led by Yair Lapid, Gideon Sa\u2019ar or Yisrael Katz wouldn\u2019t be a better place. It may even be worse, even if their wives are pious and their ways nothing but modesty and honesty. The leading candidate on the way to this light is of course Lapid \u2013 a hope-infusing victory speech at first light in the square, a new dawn for Israel. Shining photo ops with world leaders, most of whom will be happy to shake off Netanyahu, whom they see as the biggest obstacle on the way to peace and justice. Lapid would charm them. They\u2019d only find out the truth over time: His positions aren\u2019t different from his predecessor\u2019s. Only the rhetoric is a bit different.  ...A Lapid government would probably consist of the radical right brother-or-not Naftali Bennett and perhaps Avigdor Lieberman. Lapid would be like a babe in the woods.  ...Sa\u2019ar, friend of the settlers and the ultra-Orthodox, should be the terror of the center-left. The commander of the war against the asylum seekers, the founder of the deportation and round-up doctrine, may become a prime minister who exceeds his predecessor\u2019s brutal nationalism. His colleague Katz may build an island off Gaza to act as an artificial port, but he\u2019d deport Arabs in iron chains, as he beat them in his university days. All three may turn out more dangerous than Netanyahu. \nThe thought that there isn\u2019t a single hope-inspiring leader in Israel today, someone who harbingers change or can generate a revolution, is depressing.

There is more pressure on him regarding the two corruption charges as well as indications that there might be some friction both within the coaliton as well as Likud itself (links below). Here are some base rates on which I have made my initial prediction: 1.\tBase rate 1 - (Outside in view) \u2013 How long have the other Israeli PM ruled in consequtive?\na.\tAverage 677 days\nb.\tNetanyahu average 1072 days\nCurrent Netanyahu\u2019s government under the average number of days it has stayed in power in history. Would reach average by 12 of March 2018. Taking it as the initial base rate of Netanyahu\u2019s current tenure as PM e.g. will stay not resign or lose vote of confidence before that.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Prime_Ministers_of_Israel 2.\tBASE RATE 2 \u2013 How long into premiership has Netanyahu called early elections?\na.\tIn 2015 Netanyahu arranged early elections 784 days (2 years 2 months) into the 4 year mandate.\nGovernment under Netanyahu has dissolved once and early elections were been called - 33rd government. Current government has ruled more than the 784 days of the 33rd government. Thus I increase the 1 in 4 likelihood (equal chance of early elections called in any of the 4 years of Israeli government term) to 30%.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty-third_government_of_Israel#Dissolution  3.\tBASE RATE 3 \u2013 How quickly does ISR legal system indicte politicians after there has been a public announcement of them being investigated?\na.\tAverage time between accusations emerging in media and indictment are 987 days  4.\tBASE RATE 4 \u2013 Average time between the indictement and resignation of a ISR politician\na.\t25 days\nAccusations regarding Netanyahu\u2019s corruptive dealings arised in January 2017. Adding the 2 years and 8 months (987 days) would take us to August 2019 \u2013 time when we could according to average expect the attorney general to make the indictment. Even then it would not be certain that Netanyahu would step down as on average Israeli politicians would stay on for almost another month before being forced to step down from office. In light of this evidence I predict that there is a 3% chance that Netanyahu will resign in the next 9 and half months. Interestingly however according to these average calculations Netanyahu resigning would take place around the next planned elections (Novermber 2019). Taken also into account that Netanyahu likely sees it easier to be re-elected before indictment I see it supporting my prediction that he might call re-elections in 2018.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Israeli_public_officials_convicted_of_crimes_or_misdemeanors  Key assumptions/facts: 1.\tCurrent Likud government would need to lose 7 or more of its own Member of Knesset (MK) votes in a vote of no confidence for it to pass.\na.\tI asume it to be highly unlikely \u2013 5% 2.\tLikud would achieve 24 MK seats if election conducted today, current government coalition would achieve 61 seats. A drop of 6 seats in both numbers.\na.\tThis likely decreases the likelihood of early elections being called with numerous coalition parties in weak positions at the moment.\nb.\thttps://knessetjeremy.com/2017/12/04/channel-2-poll-likud-24-yesh-atid-22-zionist-union-18-bayit-yehudi-12-joint-list-12/\nc.\tAlso many of Likud\u2019s coalition partners currently are not in favor of early elections being called.\nd.\thttps://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/10/israel-benjamin-netanyahu-moshe-kahlon-coalition-immunity.html\ne.\tHence that again decreases the likelihood of Netanyahu calling early elections by 10%. 3.\tIf Netanyahu succeeds in advancing the election before Mandelblit makes a decision on whether to indict, it will be easier for him to be re-elected. If reelected, he might then be able to pass the French Law and avoid further investigations in office.\na.\thttps://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/10/israel-benjamin-netanyahu-moshe-kahlon-coalition-immunity.html  Putting all the all the possibilities together would then produce a probability of 28% of any of these happening with the major gravitation towards the probability of a early election called by Netanyahu. https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4999188,00.html\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/22/world/middleeast/22olmert.html\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/world/middleeast/israel-rivlin-netanyahu-democracy.html\nhttps://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/11/israel-germany-egypt-benjamin-netanyahu-yitzhak-molcho.html\nhttps://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/10/israel-benjamin-netanyahu-moshe-kahlon-coalition-immunity.html\nhttps://www.timesofisrael.com/poll-shows-center-left-could-block-netanyahu-coalition-in-next-election/\nhttp://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Netanyahu-asks-coalition-heads-for-political-calm-so-state-budget-can-pass-514048\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/israeli-knesset-begins-passing-pro-netanyahu-legislation/2017/11/28/245d83c0-d413-11e7-9ad9-ca0619edfa05_story.html?utm_term=.09d6e575f2d4\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-netanyahu-protests/tens-of-thousands-of-israelis-protest-against-netanyahu-corruption-idUSKBN1DW0Q8?il=0\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-netanyahu-law/israel-pushes-on-with-law-seen-protecting-pm-under-criminal-probe-idUSKBN1DR2JD\nhttp://www.jpost.com/Blogs/Window-on-Israel/Closing-in-on-Bibi-515290\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-netanyahu-protests/thousands-march-in-tel-aviv-to-protest-against-netanyahu-corruption-idUSKBN1E30RW\nhttps://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/12/israel-netanyahu-affairs-corruption-investigation-likud.html\nhttp://www.jdn.co.il/breakingnews/916799\nhttps://www.timesofisrael.com/jewish-homes-bennett-says-hell-run-for-pm-after-netanyahu/\nhttps://knessetjeremy.com/\nhttps://knessetjeremy.com/knessetjeremy-polling-average-the-israeli-poll-of-polls/"], [28563, "2017-12-16T18:26:29Z", [0.05], ""], [20510, "2017-12-16T17:03:25Z", [0.06], "event likely - timing unlikely"], [20510, "2017-12-16T17:02:26Z", [0.05], ""], [42467, "2017-12-16T13:48:18Z", [0.07], ""], [37211, "2017-12-16T12:29:09Z", [0.85], ""], [42463, "2017-12-16T10:52:27Z", [0.9], "More likely"], [30570, "2017-12-16T05:57:25Z", [0.0], "Unfortunately.

The draft must still pass two more parliamentary votes. But if written into law, police would not be allowed to say whether they have found sufficient grounds to charge Netanyahu, keeping the Israeli public in the dark until the attorney-general determines whether the prime minister is to be prosecuted. The draft law also proposes a one-year jail term for officials who leak findings to the press. Its two sponsors, confidants of Netanyahu, said the law is meant to protect suspects\u2019 rights and reputation, while the opposition derided it as a blatant attempt to protect Netanyahu and withhold knowledge from the public about his investigations. \u201cThe public doesn\u2019t need to know everything. The public will find out at the end,\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s coalition head, David Bitan told the Knesset television channel (para. 1-5). Case 1000 revolves around gifts he received from businessmen, including cigars and champagne. Netanyahu\u2019s lawyers say they were simply presents from long-time friends, with no quid pro quo (para. 14). Case 2000 focuses on suspicions Netanyahu negotiated with the publisher of Israel\u2019s best-selling newspaper for better coverage in return for curbs on the competition.

Benjamin Netanyahu has no reason to resign or lose a vote of confidence. The polls still show him scoring high and HaLikud prefers him as the frontman, as he served 8 contiguous years as PM and has a strong hold of the media and the right-wing politcal public. Most right-wingers believe that he did not commit what he was accused of and say they still support him. It will take time until reasonable conclusions from the investigations could be held, and I believe he could survive a year, as he has much higher approval rates than Ehud Olmert had at the time. Calling new elections, however, is common practice in Israel, and this is why I raised my answer from 10%. Netanyahu uses reelections many times, as happened in 2015, to solve coalition conflicts. However, 2.5 years already passed from the previous elections and unless it is going to happen in the next few months, I don't believe we are going to see reelections.
