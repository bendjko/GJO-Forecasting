The answers will surprise you, and they have radical implications for politics, policy, journalism, education, and even epistemology\u2014how we can best gain knowledge about the world.

In this book, Tetlock and Gardner free us from our foolishness. Full of great stories and simple statistics, Superforecasting gives us a new way of thinking about the complexity of the world, the limitations of our minds, and why some people can consistently outpredict a dart-throwing chimp.

In his brilliant new book, Tetlock offers a much more hopeful message, based once again on his own ground-breaking research. He shows that certain people can forecast events with accuracy much better than chance\u2014and so, perhaps, can the rest of us, if we emulate the critical thinking of these \u2018superforecasters.\u2019 The self-empowerment genre doesn\u2019t get any smarter and more sophisticated than this.\u201d\n\u2014John Horgan, Director, Center for Science Writings, Stevens Institute of Technology\n\n\u201cSuperforecasting is the rare book that is both scholarly and engaging.

I don't see it getting into the monthly categories for business in the timeframe, as the question requires it to be on a list in October and the October monthly sales are only published in November.    It is not able to get into the best sellers list until 18th October as the results are backward looking by two weeks.   For that week (18th), it has not sold the full week, it has taken from 29th - 3rd, but it is its opening salvo (but even on amazon overall it is not getting out of the 20's and their bar is very low).  On balance, and on the basis it will be in non fiction, saying it wont likely make it.  Then 4-10th Sept is next big shot.  Will modify upwards if the Amazon rankings skyrocket between now and then.
