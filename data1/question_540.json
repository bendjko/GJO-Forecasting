But then came a shortage she couldn\u2019t fix: Suddenly, there was no propane gas for sale to do the cooking.\nAnd so for several nights this summer, Ms. Soler prepared dinner above a makeshift fire of broken wooden crates\nset ablaze with kerosene to feed her extended family of 12.   \u201cThere was no other option,\u201d said Ms. Soler, a 37-year-old nurse, while scouting again for gas for her stove. \u201cWe went back to the past where we cooked soup with firewood.\u201d   Five months of political turmoil in Venezuela have brought waves of protesters into the streets, left more than 120 people dead and a set off a wide crackdown against dissent by the government, which many nations now consider\na dictatorship. An all-powerful assembly of loyalists of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro rules the country with few limits on its authority,  vowing to pursue political opponents as traitors while it rewrites the Constitution in the government\u2019s favor.   But as the government tries to stifle the opposition and regain a firm grip on the nation, the country\u2019s economic collapse, nearing its fourth year, continues to gain steam, leaving the president, his loyalists and the country in an increasingly precarious position.   Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, the state oil company that is the government\u2019s main source of income, reported in August that its revenue fell by more than a third last year amid production declines \u2014 part of a long collapse that chokes the country\u2019s supply of dollars needed for imports of food and other goods. The falling production mirrors trends in nearly every product that the nation depends on, from potatoes and corn to automotive manufacturing, with fewer than 1,100 cars made in the country through July this year. And while production falls, prices continue to rise with inflation. The price of food in Venezuela increased by more than 17 percent in July alone, according to the main nongovernmental group that tracks inflation, aggravating a food crisis that had already shattered the image of Venezuela, an oil-rich nation that, until recent years, was the economic envy of many countries in the region.\" https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/02/world/americas/venezuela-nicholas-maduro-inflation-economic-collapse.html?mcubz=3"], [691, "2017-09-05T12:00:13Z", [0.0], ""], [38770, "2017-09-05T08:43:40Z", [0.09], ""], [1034, "2017-09-05T06:53:36Z", [0.0], ""], [14847, "2017-09-05T04:00:25Z", [0.01], ""], [14847, "2017-09-05T04:00:01Z", [0.02], ""], [34044, "2017-09-05T03:42:30Z", [0.25], ""], [22689, "2017-09-05T00:10:20Z", [0.25], ""], [368, "2017-09-04T21:18:57Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-09-04T11:19:55Z", [0.0], ""], [6303, "2017-09-04T05:35:56Z", [0.01], "Based on general news and GJP consensus."], [368, "2017-09-03T19:11:12Z", [0.0], ""], [23234, "2017-09-03T19:01:38Z", [0.01], ""], [5018, "2017-09-03T16:42:44Z", [0.01], ""], [1333, "2017-09-03T12:41:45Z", [0.35], ""], [691, "2017-09-03T11:35:39Z", [0.0], ""], [590, "2017-09-03T11:05:20Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-09-03T07:07:23Z", [0.0], "When Should Multinationals Move Back into Venezuela?

Fitch reduced the nation\u2019s long-term foreign and local currency ratings to CC, just two notches from default, from CCC on Wednesday. S&P Global Ratings and Moody\u2019s Investors Service also rank the country at speculative levels. \"The expected reduction in the international reserve position in the context of sanctions will severely test the government\u2019s capacity and willingness to continue with timely debt service,\" Fitch analyst Richard Francis wrote in a statement. Speculation on a Venezuelan default is mounting as international reserves tumble to a 15-year low and U.S. sanctions further restrict the nation\u2019s financing options. The implied probability of the country missing a payment over the next 12 months rose to 64 percent from 63 percent the month prior, according to credit-default swaps data compiled by Bloomberg. The odds of a credit event over the next five years increased to 97 percent (para. 1-4). Bartenstein, B. (2017). Venezuela Cut Deeper Into Junk by Fitch on `Probable' Default. Bloomberg Markets.

Santos held a joint news conference Sunday in Cartagena with visiting U.S. Vice President Mike Pence. President Donald Trump said Friday that he will not rule out the possible use of the U.S. military to help restore democracy to Venezuela. Recalling more than a century of U.S. military action throughout Latin America, Santos said no Latin leader wants \"that phantom\" to reappear. He said a return to democracy in Venezuela must be peaceful, calling America a \"continent of peace...let us preserve it as such.\" Pence did not rule out using military force, but he did not directly talk about it either. He said there are may options available to pressure the Maduro regime in Venezuela, including more economic and diplomatic pressure.

Venezuela's state-owned oil firm, Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), has been secretly negotiating since at least early this year with Russia's biggest state-owned oil company, Rosneft (ROSN.MM) - offering ownership interests in up to nine of Venezuela's most productive petroleum projects, according to a top Venezuelan government official and two industry sources familiar with the talks.

Rosneft delivered Venezuela\u2019s state-owned firm more than $1 billion in April alone in exchange for a promise of oil shipments later.

The brimming oil inventories that have pressured prices for three years had started to decline in recent weeks as U.S. demand rose and OPEC production was reduced. But some analysts say this decline in stockpiles could reverse later in the year as U.S. crude production continues to grow. A poll of 15 investment banks, surveyed by The Wall Street Journal at the end of July, predicted that Brent crude, the international benchmark, will average $53 a barrel this year, down $2 from the June survey. The banks expect West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. oil gauge, to average $51 a barrel this year, down a dollar from the previous survey. Banks in the survey have also downgraded their expectations for next year, predicting Brent crude will average $55 a barrel, down $2 from the June poll. The banks expect WTI to average $53 a barrel in 2018, also down $2 (para 1-4). However, stock levels around the world continue to be above historical averages, as the world struggles to drain the crude glut that has pressured prices since 2014. That\u2019s in part due to the increasing flow of oil from U.S. fields (para 11). U.S. oil production last week rose by 20,000 barrels a day, the EIA data showed. Meanwhile, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which last year clinched a deal to limit its output, has seen some of its members produce above the agreed-upon levels as they make up for budget shortfalls (para. 11-12).

The government and state-owned oil company Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela SA, also known as PdVSA, together owe $5 billion in principal and interest payments due between now and the end of the year, according to Caracas Capital Markets. The country has $725 million due this month alone, the Venezuelan investment bank said.

During their house arrest, they\u2019d been broadcasting messages using Periscope, a live-streaming service that has become extraordinarily popular in Venezuela, encouraging their supporters to oppose President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. \nPerhaps ironically, hours before his arrest Ledezma had lambasted the opposition coalition, MUD, for its many failures in the lead-up to Sunday\u2019s vote.

It was planning new laws, the release of its political prisoners and overhauls intended to pull Venezuela out of a deep economic crisis. Its eye was on the presidency in 2018. But with one contentious vote on Sunday, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro effectively liquidated any political challenge that the opposition might present for him for years to come. Around midnight, officials certified the creation of a new political body, known as the constituent assembly, with the power to rewrite the Constitution to favor Mr. Maduro and empowered in the meantime to dismiss any branch of government viewed as disloyal. It was a dramatic crash for the country\u2019s opposition in its long quest to regain control of Venezuela after a tide of popular discontent brought Hugo Ch\u00e1vez to the presidency in 1999. Not since the politicians joined the military to back a failed coup in 2002 \u2014 which spurred Mr. Ch\u00e1vez to purge his opponents \u2014 have members of Venezuela\u2019s opposition been laid so low. \u201cThey played all their cards, and they played them effectively,\u201d said Christopher Sabatini, a foreign policy expert at the Columbia University School of International and Public Affairs, citing the opposition\u2019s attempts to parry Mr. Maduro this year. \u201cBut now all of their channels for representation and means for mediation have essentially evaporated.\u201d Mr. Maduro\u2019s decision to sweep aside his rivals leaves them at a difficult crossroads, analysts said.

Why? Its members are addicted to oil. Eight months after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries announced a plan for its 14 members and 10 allied countries to withhold almost 2% of the world\u2019s oil every day to boost prices, seven of the 11 OPEC members that pledged to cut appear to be producing more oil than promised. Crude prices have actually fallen, by 7.6% to $52.52 a barrel, since the beginning of the year\u2014half what the cartel called a fair price just three years ago and a level that some say is here for the long term. Previously, low production costs meant OPEC members profited even when oil prices fell. These days, members have ramped up government spending to keep populations happy and cover military expenses, and don\u2019t have a cushion to let oil revenues slip. Their strained budgets can be covered only through increasingly high prices per barrel, and if prices are low they need to produce more (para 1-5). The output has stolen market share from the cartel\u2019s members and pushed prices lower. OPEC\u2019s share of the global oil market has shrunk to 40% today from 55% in the early 1970s, when its embargo on sales to the West quadrupled oil prices in six months (para 13). The dynamic working against OPEC is that, collectively, its members need the highest oil prices of any industry player\u2014more than companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp. , Royal Dutch Shell PLC and most U.S. shale producers, according to Goldman Sachs . For decades, OPEC was the low-cost producer of oil. During the boom years of 2011 through 2014, OPEC members, which largely fund national spending with oil revenue, could balance their budgets with oil prices $10 to $40 a barrel less than most oil companies needed to fund their spending and pay dividends. Today, OPEC needs $10 to $20 a barrel more than Big Oil and U.S. exploration and production outfits, the investment bank said in a report to clients (para. 13- 15).

The new constitution will permit the government to bring order to Venezuela, convulsed by unrest and a devastating economic crisis, Mr. Maduro said. \u201cI wanted to be the first to vote for peace, for sovereignty and the independence of Venezuela,\u201d the president said. \u201cToday is a historic day.\u201d Mr. Maduro\u2019s adversaries, who have led four months of protests that have cost at least 113 lives, say that the assembly the president wants would lead to the dissolution of the opposition-controlled congress and an end to the few democratic levers still available to them. Mr. Maduro and other aides have warned that, with the assembly, they\u2019d arrest key opponents and dismiss Attorney General Luisa Ortega, a former government stalwart who recently broke with the government. \u201cThere is a privileged group that wants to do away with the constitution and the country,\u201d said Julio Borges, president of the congress and a sharp critic of the government. \u201cThat violent minority has aggravated the moral and social crisis of the Venezuelan family.

President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro had ordered a rewriting of Venezuela\u2019s Constitution. The election on Sunday was simply to pick the members of the constituent assembly that will carry it out; there was no option to reject the process. Nearly all candidates were politicians close to Mr. Maduro, presumably assuring that the outcome would leave his leftist movement with complete control of the country once the assembly takes charge. \u201cI said rain, thunder or lightning, the 30th of July was going to come,\u201d the president said in a shaky video made from his vehicle after he cast his ballot. He remained sanguine throughout the day, saying the vote would soon bring peace to a country where more than 110 people have died in unrest during protests this year against his rule. But the powers of the new assembly members will be so vast that they could possibly remove Mr. Maduro from office, some analysts noted, ending a presidency that has been deeply unpopular, even among many leftists (para. 1-5). At least 10 people were killed in clashes between the police and protesters, the government said, including two boys, ages 13 and 17, who were shot in the western state of T\u00e1chira. A police officer was shot in front of a school in T\u00e1chira, and a 43-year-old man was killed in the central city of Barquisimeto in Lara State when a bullet pierced his head, according to the state prosecutor\u2019s office (para. 13). The focus of many voters in Caracas seemed to be on food, not politics. Venezuela remains in an economic tailspin, causing severe shortages of food and medicine (para 22) \u201cWhen the opposition got the National Assembly, they said there would be food, and now it\u2019s even worse,\u201d said Juan Carlos Hern\u00e1ndez, 43, a government employee who said he supported Mr. Maduro. \u201cThe first thing I\u2019m asking of the constitutional assembly is that they start putting out food,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause if they don\u2019t, the people are going to get angry\u201d (para. 22-24).

President Nicolas Maduro has scheduled a vote that would allow him to replace the current legislative body, the National Assembly, with an entirely new institution known as the Constituent Assembly. Maduro's opponents control the National Assembly, holding 112 of the body's 167 seats, and have been battling with him for political power since they won a majority of seats in December 2015. Before the winners of those elections took office, Maduro stacked the country's Supreme Court with loyalists to prevent his own impeachment (para 1-3). Experts say the vote's outcome will be a foregone conclusion: Maduro will be able to consolidate political power (para.5). The opposition hasn't submitted any candidates for the vote because it doesn't recognize the legitimacy of the election. Maduro foes aren't going to the polls and instead have scheduled a large protest in the capital, Caracas, for Sunday. \nUltimately, Sunday's vote and the creation of Maduro's Constituent Assembly would give the President immense political power to revise the Venezuelan Constitution. \nMaduro says the vote will help bring peace to a polarized Venezuela, with all branches of the government falling under the political movement founded by Maduro's late mentor and predecessor, Hugo Chavez. \nCritics in Venezuela and abroad argue a Maduro mandate would erode any last signs of democracy in the country (para. 5-9).

Analysts refer to a breaking point. \nIt is clear to everyone that Venezuela is in crisis, but there's no easy way out. Divisions in Venezuela run deep. \nThe opposition has been vocal since Hugo Ch\u00e1vez came to power 18 years ago, but problems have become more acute under President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, a leader who does not have the following that his predecessor did, and under whose watch the economy has been pushed to the brink (para. 1-3). Re-energizing 'Chavismo'? The government now wants to create a constituent assembly. Essentially its purpose will be to rewrite the country's constitution (para 6). \nIt is a move that the government says will enable the country to be at peace. But the opposition says it is anti-democratic and feels it is just a way for President Maduro to consolidate his power. \"A constituent assembly is something that could be positive,\" says Professor Miguel Tinker Salas of Pomona College, California. \nHe argues that if it can take steps to address violence and reform the economy that is heavily dependent on oil, something positive could come out of this. \"But in this context, I just don't see how that might happen.\" \nProfessor Julia Buxton, a Venezuela expert, says there are two ways of interpreting the government's plans: as a way to re-energise \"Chavismo\", the socialist ideology of former President Ch\u00e1vez or as a way to build parallel institutions to the ones already in place and that are controlled by the opposition (para. 6-9). Opposition disarray \nThe opposition says the country's democratic institutions are being challenged (para 12). In the past few months, it has created a strategy to try and disrupt President Maduro's leadership, to try and force the government to change. But despite general strikes, the protests and the recent unofficial referendum, which rejected the constituent assembly, the government remains in power. \nOne of the problems the opposition faces is that it is not one unified party (para. 12-15). Sanctions threat Under US President Barack Obama, targeted sanctions on individuals were introduced (para 21). \nDonald Trump's administration has said it will consider further sanctions. But anything broader than targeted sanctions would be a serious blow for the country's crisis-stricken economy. Oil revenues account for 95% of Venezuela's foreign earnings. \nVenezuela may have the largest oil reserves in the world but they are heavy crude reserves and the country needs light crude from the US to be able to process it. \n\"Close off several hundred thousand barrels of oil a day, which is what the US is buying, and you are actually hurting the Venezuelan people, you're not hurting Maduro,\" says Prof Salas. \nIt could also have other unintended consequences, says Prof Buxton (para 21-25). 'Too toxic' Despite the threats of sanctions and the warnings from international leaders, the government is confident that the vote will go ahead (para 27). \nThe opposition is doing all it can to make sure it will not. \n\"At this moment, it's really too toxic to really talk about the details of how to engineer some type of orderly transition,\" says Michael McCarthy, a research fellow for the Centre for Latin American and Latino Studies at the American University in Washington DC (para 27-29).
