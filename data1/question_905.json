Overall this was a fairly impressive aerial display for the leader of a bankrupt pariah state living under crushing international sanctions. It's also worth considering that this level of VIP-related international logistics are largely a new concept for North Korea, although the short flight to Dalian, China to meet with Xi Jinping in early May, which also included an Il-76 cargo jet carrying Kim's limousines and support staff, seems to have been used as a test run for the Singapore Summit.

There are currently some 28,500 US forces based in the South. Trump said on Friday he will meet Kim for the historic summit as originally scheduled after extraordinary Oval Office talks with a top envoy from Pyongyang. Trump told reporters that denuclearisation - and a formal end to the decades-old Korean war - would be on the table in Singapore. However, Mattis stressed that \"any discussion about the number of US troops in the Republic of Korea is subject to... the Republic of Korea's invitation to have them there, and the discussions between the United States and the Republic of Korea, separate and distinct from the negotiations that are going on with DPRK (North Korea)...

The uncertainty and frustration that often characterize negotiations with North Korea have been compounded, in part, by Trump himself. The president abruptly called off the potentially historic meeting in a letter to the North Korean leader that some analysts saw as a classic \"Art of the Deal\" attempt to gain leverage. The difficulty in closing gaps between the North Korean and US positions is adding another kind of uncertainty. \"After listening to Secretary Pompeo today, I would argue North Korea is still unwilling -- and maybe never will be willing -- to satisfy the Trump Administration's goal of a denuclearization agreement before any summit in Singapore,\" said Harry Kazianis, Director of Defense Studies at the Center for the National Interest. \"And make no mistake: this is the key to getting a summit finalized.\"\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-politics-eu/as-italy-forms-anti-establishment-government-row-erupts-with-eu-idUSKCN1IW31P https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-russia/north-koreas-kim-jong-un-says-norths-will-for-denuclearization-unchanged-kcna-idUSKCN1IW30S\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2018/05/30/trump-is-wrong-about-north-korea-says-the-cia/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.15882937833f\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/31/north-korea-summit-uninvited-guests-could-foil-trumps-objectives\n"], [745, "2018-05-31T19:45:41Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.88, 0.12], ""], [41922, "2018-05-31T19:22:36Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5], ""], [27705, "2018-05-31T19:18:03Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.25], "With uncertainty, I think they will meet in June in Singapore, as previously planned.  It is more difficult to apply standardized analysis tools to the Trump administration than it is to other institutions, because the predictable drivers of events for the Trump administration are (1) Trump's fragile ego; (2) Trump's lack of impulse control; (3) Trump's perspective on other people; (4) Trump's lack of agency.  In practice, this leads me to think that Trump wants the meeting to take place as previously planned - in June, in Singapore - because I read Trump as seeing this as his Winning 100%.  He gets to appear to his base as having forced Kim Jong Un to do Trump's bidding entirely, even after Trump publicly refused to meet and blamed Kim.  Now, Trump can appear to himself and to his base to have accepted Kim's agreement to what Trump wants.  I think that Trump does not want to give the meeting to any other location because he wants to appear as though he is getting Kim to agree to Trump's original terms, Singapore in June.  The appearance is Key.  There is some chance that Kim will decline to meet under these conditions, because he may want to cause Trump to lose face.  But Kim can only do this if he does not lose face in declining to meet. For now, that would be tough - but the Trump administration is famous for snatching defeat from the jaws of victory, so in the coming 2 weeks, T or one of his team could say/do something that gives Kim the perfect excuse to cancel.  It might be that Pompeo and others have the good sense to try to keep utterance and event from queering the deal at this point.  But Trump has poor impulse control, and some of the planned navy exercises or other events can add up to another calamity.  I think the ball is in Kim's court.  I think his goal is to get public approval, which translates to money and trade and a huge improvement in Face.  If Kim can make some good deals with South Korea and China between now and the proposed meeting time, he can exercise his option to cost Trump face with less cost to himself.  But it won't be easy.

A few sections I found notable and some commentary: 1) \"Earlier, a U.S. official said negotiations about the summit\u2019s agenda have so far been slow going, and the two fundamental issues, the definition of North Korean denuclearization and whether both sides would take actions at the same time or separately, remained unsettled.\" Commentary: These are the same two sticking points that have held up these discussions since the early 2000s. The article notes that North Korea is seeking economic benefits in exchange for a pledge to denuclearize. A US official cited in the article notes that before the summit, the North is \u201cgoing to have to make clear what they are willing to do.\u201d I think the issue is not whether the two sides will be able to reach a comprehensive agreement at this stage, but whether the two sides can reach some sort of \"face saving\" agreement that allows Trump to publicly say he got North Korea to denuclearize, brought peace, etc. It's also difficult to tell how much of the US rhetoric is non-negotiable versus intended for public consumption. The fact that negotiations are ongoing suggests that the US is somewhat flexible in its position.  2) \"South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency quoted Seoul\u2019s Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon as saying in a speech on Wednesday that the differences between North Korea and the United States on the denuclearization issue remained \u201cquite significant\u201d and it would not be easy to narrow the gap. However, Cho added that the engagement of the leaders of the two countries meant \u201cchances are high that common ground can be found.\u201d Commentary: South Korean officials have been Pollyanna-ish to an absurd degree on the prospects for this summit. If they are saying differences are \"quite significant\" you can be sure there's a wide gulf.  https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-usa/north-korea-official-in-u-s-for-talks-on-summit-differences-remain-idUSKCN1IV2NS"], [29033, "2018-05-31T02:47:25Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.85, 0.15], "High level talks between the US and North Korea are taking place on three levels: 1) On Sunday, a team led by US diplomat Sung Kim, who is intimately familiar with US-NK nuclear negotiations, met with North Korean officials in Panmunjeom. 2) A team led by Kim Chang Son, a top aide of Kim Jong Un, is in Singapore to meet with Deputy Chief of Staff Joe Haggin. Yonhap surmises that \"Concomitant with discussing diplomatic protocol and security, the two sides may be checking out the Capella Hotel [on Sentosa Island in Singapore] as a suitable venue for the summit and for lodging the two leaders.\" Multiple news agencies reported the presence of the North Korean delegation at the Capella, which is currently hosting the US team. The US delegation meanwhile was spotted later that day checking out the Shangri La Hotel. The article speculates that this indicates a decision on the venue may be \"imminent.\" If true, this is the strongest piece of evidence yet that indicates things will move forward as planned.  3) Kim Yong Chul, Vice President of the Central Committee of the KWP, flew to New York to meet with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. South Korean media speculates that he may be carrying a personal letter from Kim Jong Un to Donald Trump (It's not clear how reliable this speculation is. In my experience, the South Korean media is notorious for publishing baseless speculation as news). According to South Korean media, Pompeo and Kim concluded a 90-minute dinner meeting today ahead of the main talks tomorrow. (if you're curious as to how closely the South Korean media are following this meeting, Yonhap notes that Kim flew from Beijing to JFK on Air China CA981) Over the weekend, NBC News claims to have obtained a CIA intelligence estimate that concludes that Kim Jong Un does not intend to give up his nuclear weapons. Despite the media reporting these finding as established fact, intelligence assessments are more about forecasting potential future scenarios and making recommendations for decision-making. They do not purport to be telepathic insights into the leadership of the target country, instead saying, in effect, \"here are all the things what we think could happen and here are some possible actions we can take to get there.\" These assessments tend to be conservative and biased towards the status quo. They are only as good as the reliability of the intelligence that goes into them. Buried deep in the article, NBC notes that much of the report's analysis was graded medium or low confidence. The fact that this assessment was published at the beginning of May and the fact that pre-summit negotiations appear to be picking up would seem to indicate that the Trump administration feels the concessions the North is offering are sufficient to continue the process. What's more, in his open letter almost calling off the summit, Trump primarily took umbrage with the North's colorful language and did not mention any false promises or that the North was backtracking.                    It also appears North Korea has, as expected, changed its tone toward the US in its media. A recent article on Kcna.kp demonstrates this shift with its lack of hyperbole, insults, threats of war, and the general belligerent, hostile rhetoric typical of North Korean commentary on the US. In the article, entitled \"Rodong Sinmun Urges U.S. to Suit Atmosphere of Dialogue,\" North Korea calls on the US to cease KORUS military drills and to stop publicly saying that the military option is still on the table. The anonymous writer calls the drills \"the main root cause of aggravating tension\"  and says that the drills are \"unnecessary\" when the two nations are engaged in dialogue. The article then concludes with a mild rebuke: \"It is high time the U.S. behaved properly, clearly seeing what is profitable for it.\" At present, there do not seem to be any major KORUS military drills ongoing and the next major one is scheduled for August. It seems that North Korea will put the fate of the drills on the agenda when the two sides meet.

The uptick in the pace of activities indicates that both sides are still keen on meeting and thus far there is nothing to contradict that hypothesis.

However, the US secretary of state, John Foster Dulles, did not accommodate this attempt to achieve such a treaty. A final peace settlement has never been achieved.[3] The Armistice formally divided the Korean peninsula despite it being a united country for thousands of years[4][5][6] before 1945.[7] The signed Armistice established the Korean Demilitarized Zone, the de facto new border between the two nations, put into force a cease-fire, and finalized repatriation of prisoners of war. The Demilitarized Zone runs close to the 38th parallel and has separated North and South Korea since 15 August 1945.\nRetrieved from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Armistice_Agreement  Here's the Panmunjom thingy: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panmunjom_Declaration I'd go see if I could find a translation closer to the source.

The fact that this summit happened at all is a testament to the gravity the two Koreas place on going forward with the NK-US summit, especially in light of the North's umbrage taken with the South this past week.  So much for \"suspending\" all high level inter-Korean talks. Video and photos from the summit (available in the same Yonhap article) depict the two leaders smiling and hugging. Getting the summit to go forward and ending with a successful resolution is essential for Moon to begin carrying out his flagship inter-Korean reconciliation project, which for Kim Jong-Un will result in an economic windfall in the form of South Korean investment as well as a diplomatic counterweight to Chinese dependence. I wouldn't be surprised if Moon told Kim to tone down the hostile propaganda for the time being so as not to upset Washington. North Korean state media has not yet released a statement on the summit as of this writing.  Although Trump has not formally reinstated the summit, US officials involved in the preparations are heading to Singapore as scheduled and, according to White House Spokesperson Sarah Sanders, \"They will prepare should the summit take place.\" At this point, I think it is clear that the summit will go forward. The key uncertainty now is will it be on June 12th or rescheduled? The New York Times, citing an anonymous White Official claimed  via indirect quotation that \"even if the meeting were reinstated, holding it on June 12 would be impossible, given the lack of time and the amount of planning needed.\" Trump, however, vehemently denied this on Twitter saying the Times' reporting was \"WRONG AGAIN!\" and going so far as to accuse the New York Times of making up sources. In response, The Times then denied this denial, adding a direct quote from the source stating \"there\u2019s really not a lot of time \u2014 we\u2019ve lost quite a bit of time that we would need to prepare for the summit meeting. June 12 is in 10 minutes.\" A freelance journalist identified the source as Matt Pottinger, a member of Trump's National Security Council, though this claim should be taken with a healthy dose of salt. I think it's highly likely the source in question--whomever it is--did say those words, but as history has demonstrated, not all officials in Trump's White House are privy to Trump's decision-making and Trump has been known to change his mind at the last minute without informing all of his staff. The source may have been stating his own assessment of the situation. Also of note from the original Times article is that they indirectly quote \"several officials\" who claim that, despite John Bolton's notorious hawkishness and views on North Korean regime change, he \"is not trying to maneuver against a meeting, in part because he knows it is important to Mr. Trump.\" http://news.naver.com/main/hotissue/read.nhn?mid=hot&sid1=100&cid=1079165&iid=2748507&oid=001&aid=0010109407&ptype=052 https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2018/05/26/white-house-spokesperson-pre-advance-team-for-us-north-korea-summit-in-singapore-to-leave-as-scheduled.html https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/25/world/asia/trump-summit-north-korea.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/25/world/asia/trump-summit-north-korea.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news https://mobile.twitter.com/yashar/status/1000403380395790336"], [25705, "2018-05-26T20:08:17Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.6, 0.4], "What a cliffhanger!"], [47482, "2018-05-26T19:34:21Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.75, 0.2], "Injecting uncertainty back into this equation that I never should have taken out.

Does \"extended beyond that date\" mean the talks could last multiple days or does it refer to changing the date of the summit?

But suddenly, President of the United States of America (Donald) Trump made public his official stand on May 24 to cancel the DPRK-US summit that had already been made a fait accompli. Explaining the reason for it, he said that the statement made by Vice-Foreign Minister of the DPRK Choe Son Hui carried \"tremendous anger and open hostility\" and that it is not appropriate to hold the meeting at present, a precious one that has long been planned. I would like to take this expression of his stand on the DPRK-US summit as a decision not consistent with the desire of humankind for peace and stability in the world, to say nothing of those in the Korean peninsula. As for the \"tremendous anger and open hostility\" referred to by President Trump, it is just a reaction to the unbridled remarks made by the US side, which has long pressed the DPRK unilaterally to scrap nuclear programme ahead of the DPRK-US summit. The inglorious situation today is a vivid expression of the severity of the present status of the hostile DPRK-US relations of long historical roots and the urgent necessity for the summit meeting for the improvement of the ties.

The two Koreas planned to hold a meeting last week, but the North called if off at the last minute, taking issue with joint military drills between South Korea and the United States.

The statement is notable in its lack of hyperbole and invective and actually goes so far to as to praise Trump, stating: \"As far as the historic DPRK-U.S. summit is concerned, we have inwardly highly appreciated President Trump for having made the bold decision, which any other U.S. presidents dared not, and made efforts for such a crucial event as the summit.\" This is probably the loftiest praise of a sitting US president ever expressed by a North Korean government organ, and it signifies that diplomacy is not dead. A period of increased hostility is not in the cards at the moment.  Kim also explains that Choe Son Hui's remarks yesterday were not intended to be hostile towards the US in general, rather Choe was expressing his anger--in that unique North Korean way--at the remarks Pence made: \"As for the \"tremendous anger and open hostility\" referred to by President Trump, it is just a reaction to the unbridled remarks made by the U.S. side which has long pressed the DPRK unilaterally to scrap nuclear program ahead of the DPRK-U.S. summit.\" Notably, Kim ends his remarks reiterating the North's desire to continue dialogue with the US: \"We would like to make known to the U.S. side once again that we have the intent to sit with the U.S. side to solve problem regardless of ways at any time.\" Earlier today, Trump closed his open letter cancelling the summit by stating: \u201cIf you change your mind having to do with this most important summit, please do not hesitate to call me or write.\u201d Thus within the course of the last 12 hours both sides have made it clear that there is no open hostility and both sides expressed their desire to continue this processes. The situation is still quite salvageable and I expect that both sides will continue to talk through backchannels.

The source went on to say that the North raised logistical concerns, such as the availability of fuel for the trip and security for Kim Jong Un while on the ground in Singapore. The article speculates that Kim is fearful of a coup while he is out of the country (due to the opacity of the North Korean state and the reclusiveness of its leadership, any reporting on the mindset or actions of NK's inner circle should always be taken with a large serving of salt and treated as speculative at best and outright false at worst and it seems improbable that Kim's team would discuss their leader's domestic insecurity with their \"mortal enemy\"). This reporting helps to flesh out the context for Trump's remarks the other day and tells us that Trump's restraint isn't merely due to the North's propaganda outburst, but that his doubts are corroborated by North Korea's capriciousness on the ground. It also helps us move away from (though does not rule out) the hypothesis that the events of the past few days are just posturing. North Korea's words and actions send a non-committal message and Trump is reacting in kind to that uncertainty.  In a similar vein, CNN, citing \"a senior administration official involved in planning for the talks,\" reports that the Trump administration is seeking additional, substantial high level talks with North Korea to work out details prior to any summit, thus further increasing the probability of a delay. This makes sense as the typical protocol in diplomatic processes is for diplomats and bureaucrats from two countries to work out the majority of the agreement and only when the agreement is near complete do the leaders meet face to face to put their signatures on it. National leaders rarely, if ever, do the heavy lifting in diplomatic talks. This call for more talks indicates that a signature-worthy agreement has not yet been reached.  On the North Korean side, the KCNA issued a statement from First Vice Minister Choe Son Hui attacking Vice President Pence for remarks made on Fox News in which Pence said North Korea would end up like Libya if they did not disarm. After a spate of boilerplate invective, Choe goes on to note that \"It is the U.S. who has asked for dialogue, but now it is misleading the public opinion as if we have invited them to sit with us. I only wonder what is the ulterior motive behind its move and what is it the U.S. has calculated to gain from that.\" That's in direct contradiction to the US narrative in which Kim, via South Korea, invited the US to dialogue. This is either propaganda or there were backchannel negotiations prior to the South Korean visit to the White House a few weeks prior. He concludes his statement by effectively saying that the ball is in the US court: \"We will neither beg the U.S. for dialogue nor take the trouble to persuade them if they do not want to sit together with us.\" Here he is either signaling Pyongyang's intent to continue dialogue or setting up a narrative frame blaming the US for the collapse of talks. (It may be of value to note that Trump was not mentioned in the statement) By putting these three new pieces of the puzzle into the context of the previous evidence, a clearer image begins to emerge, bringing us closer to the \"delay/cancel\" hypothesis. We still cannot rule out the possibility of North Korean posturing in order to prod Trump into making some \"good faith\" concessions to secure their participation, but North Korean actions and words seem to inject a legitimate uncertainty into the situation and the Trump administration is responding by slowing down the pace of events, because Trump is no longer certain as to what kind of deal, if any, he will leave Singapore with. This uncertainty taken in light of the amount of time remaining before this question is resolved warrants a further decrease in forecast probability.  The next indicator to watch out for will be if North Korean officials show up for the next preparation meeting, scheduled to be held in Singapore this weekend--assuming the results end up being published in open sources. https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-says-kim-jong-un-serious-about-nuclear-talks-but-suggests-summit-could-fall-through/2018/05/22/a2a884e2-5dd8-11e8-a4a4-c070ef53f315_story.html?utm_term=.b4b4451e4f1a https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/23/politics/trump-north-korea-summit/index.html http://www.kcna.kp/kcna.user.article.retrieveNewsViewInfoList.kcmsf#this"], [21884, "2018-05-24T02:03:22Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.55, 0.4], ""], [172, "2018-05-23T23:12:15Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "The dear leaders seem to be going to their respective corners...\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/23/north-korea-latest-news-disarm-for-economic-relief-says-pompeo"], [58298, "2018-05-23T22:26:02Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.33, 0.67], ""], [58420, "2018-05-23T22:25:28Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5], "It is a class assignment"], [58316, "2018-05-23T21:57:15Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.8], ""], [58215, "2018-05-23T21:27:40Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.6, 0.4], ""], [58317, "2018-05-23T20:56:01Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.0, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.7, 0.27], "Given Trump and NK's recent backing off over whether the meeting must occur, I'm increasing the possibility of no meeting occurring at all, but thinking a meeting is still likely to happen."], [58292, "2018-05-23T20:28:42Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.55, 0.45], ""], [58264, "2018-05-23T19:45:49Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.3, 0.7], ""], [43197, "2018-05-23T19:23:21Z", [0.01, 0.03, 0.02, 0.0, 0.01, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.19, 0.72], ""], [49603, "2018-05-23T18:55:32Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.35, 0.0, 0.0, 0.65, 0.0], "Kim seems a little desperate, but wants to convey the image of being in control of the terms of this meeting "], [57918, "2018-05-23T16:47:26Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.25], ""], [57918, "2018-05-23T16:45:29Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.65, 0.35], "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/05/23/trump-kim-jong-un-summit-schedule-604047"], [28166, "2018-05-23T16:39:06Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [1639, "2018-05-23T15:38:33Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.3, 0.7], "I think that the one handling the knife by the handle is KJU\u2014with a little help from his friends\u2014the meeting will happen when KJU wants, not when Trump wants.

Wow, was I wrong. This is a great lesson in intellectual humility and how reality consistently confounds the reductionist \"narratives\" we devise to explain events in society. These narratives often privilege one or two explanatory variables and are undergirded by an ideological framework and so cause us to miss the forest for the trees. We become blind to or dismissive of indicators that contradict our favored hypotheses. In order to see the truth, it's imperative to reject the forming of emotional attachments to our positions and to let the evidence speak for itself, not let the theory speak for the evidence.  There have been a number of changes, some anticipated, in the last day or so that alter the outlook for the summit. I'll start with the US side. Following a meeting with SK President Moon Jae-in, Trump told reporters that \"There's a very substantial chance ... it won\u2019t work out. And that\u2019s OK. That doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t work out over a period of time. But it may not work out for June 12. But there is a good chance that we\u2019ll have the meeting.\" This jibes with the New York Times reporting over the weekend. Buried deep in the Reuters article is a note that Trump seems to put the onus on Chinese manipulation for the recent downtown in atmosphere. Quoth Trump: \"President Xi is a world-class poker player.\" I can't help but wonder if Trump's suspicions are the conclusion of the US intelligence community or the Fox News editorial board.   There was also a report this morning that the the USS Milius, a guided missile destroyer that was recently upgraded with a state-of-the-art Aegis air defense system, arrived in Yokosuka Naval Base in Japan. According to Reuters, \"The show of force is a reminder of the military pressure that can be brought to bear on North Korea as the United States seeks to press it to abandon its nuclear weapons and its ballistic missile program.\" Indeed, there is no doubt that the arrival of the Milius to the 7th Fleet, along with two other similarly upgraded ships, is intended to counter North Korea's missile threat, but the timing is somewhat coincidental as naval deployments are often planned months or years in advance. On the North Korean side there were also two developments of note. First, a group of Western and Chinese journalists arrived in Wonsan, North Korea to witness the planned shutdown of the Punggye-ri nuclear test site in a signal of the North's continued commitment to whatever they think they agreed to (I'm reminded of similar theater back in 2008 when the North invited international journalists to witness the symbolic destruction of one of its nuclear water cooling towers). It has been pointed out that experts who could verify the irreversible closure of the site were not invited. This event was planned well in advance of the recent developments.  Second, the Associated Press reports that North Korean \"State media unleashed three strongly worded commentaries slamming Seoul and Washington for the maneuvers and demanding Seoul take action against defectors it claimed were sending anti-North Korea propaganda leaflets across the border.\" This is in stark contrast to the less shrill tone deployed as of late (compare this with the tone of the KCNA's reporting on the Kim-Pompeo meeting). The articles in question are available on the North Korean state-run propaganda site Uriminzokkiri and only one of them has been translated into English as of this writing. The first, called \"An intentionally rash provocation puts the brake on North-South relations,\" criticizes a North Korean defector group, calling them \"human trash\", for launching anti-NK propaganda leaflet balloons from the city of Gwangju on the 12th and saying the action was a violation of the Panmunjeom Declaration. Two other articles written in the North's standard hyperbolic boilerplate take up the North's criticism of ongoing KORUS military drills, again, framing these stories in the context of violations of the Panmunjeom Declaration.  Another spate of articles of note continue to call for the return of several female workers at a North Korean restaurant in China who defected last year. Under the South Korean constitution North Koreans are considered South Korean citizens and thus it is illegal for the South Korean government to repatriate defectors (although it has happened in at least one instance I can recall when a fisherman claimed to have accidentally crossed the sea border). The North is well aware of this fact and it almost seems like Pyongyang is testing Moon to see just how far he is willing to bend for reconciliation. Regardless, as I said previously, North-South relations and North-US relations need to be considered as separate, and a downturn in one does not imply or foretell a downturn in the other. So what are we to make of all this? There are a few hypotheses that come to mind. The first is that this is all just pre-negotiation posturing and framing events for public consumption so as not to appear that one side is coming to the negotiating table out of weakness and to gain concessions. Under this, there are two plausible sub-hypotheses: first, that the summit will go ahead as scheduled, and second that the summit will go ahead at a later date. The other hypothesis is that one or both sides is getting cold feet and intends to back out. Perhaps Trump feels he's getting played or he's falling deeper under the sway of John Bolton. Perhaps Kim never intended to go through with the summit and its all just political theater. It's interesting because you'd think that Pompeo's face-to-face meeting with Kim would have settled many of the outstanding concerns. At any rate, at this stage, I don't feel there is enough evidence that is diagnostic enough to rule out definitively either hypothesis, as the evidence is plausibly consistent with both hypotheses. But the potential for miscalculation and miscommunication, combined with the now distinct plausibility of a delay warrants a decrease in forecast probability. The next signpost will be how North Korea responds to Trump's remarks, as well as how Moon responds to Pyongyang's demands for repatriation of the restaurant workers.  https://mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKCN1IN1Q1 https://www.reuters.com/articlet/us-northkorea-missiles-milius-japan/u-s-bolsters-asia-ballistic-missile-defense-as-trump-kim-summit-nears-idUSKCN1IN0O9 https://mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKCN1IN08F http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-north-korea-summit-20180522-story,amp.html http://www.uriminzokkiri.com/index.php?ptype=ugisa1&no=1152736 http://www.uriminzokkiri.com/index.php?ptype=ugisa1&no=1152676 http://www.uriminzokkiri.com/index.php?lang=eng&ftype=urigisa&no=1082 http://www.uriminzokkiri.com/index.php?ptype=ugisa1&no=1152885 http://www.uriminzokkiri.com/index.php?lang=eng&ftype=document&no=11372"], [25705, "2018-05-22T21:28:17Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.04, 0.96], "All the story has been incredible.

The issue is to phase or not to phase the approach to de-nuclearization. \nThe second question is about delaying the meeting. Too much delay makes for more mishaps and meltdowns before they even meet.

So while the factual content of the report is most likely valid (and does appear to be confirmed by another party, in this case, probably someone close to President Moon, the cited \"foreign official\"), the framing of the story should be approached with caution. My first instinct was that someone close to Trump intentionally leaked the story with Trump's blessing to deflect the notion that Trump too eagerly wanted the summit and to put the US in a better bargaining position, but upon further the review, the framing of the story is so negative it was likely leaked to discredit Trump and make him look like a wishy-washy leader. In reality its quite routine and normal for a leader to reevaluate and double check his reasoning for a major decision and to ask for input and advice from top aides, especially in light of changes to the situation, as occurred with North Korea's statements last week. In other words, Trump's actions don't necessarily represent Trump's desire to cancel the summit, rather, it's just a leader doing regular leadership things and staying abreast of the situation. On the North Korean side, it's also informative to go directly to the source and see what the North Koreans themselves are saying, and in doing so, bypassing the media's interpretation and filtering. The statement that precipitated the latest doubt was made by  North Korean First Vice Minister of Foreign Minister Kim Gye Gwan (also the North's nuclear negotiator) on May 16. Upon reading Kim's  speech (link below), it becomes apparent that he is not threatening to cancel the summit (no where in the text of the speech does one find words like \"cancel\" or its synonyms). Rather, he is primarily objecting to Bolton's mention of the \"Libya model\" (which Trump has already publicly repudiated) and saying that if the US adopts that line in its negotiations, the talks will be doomed to failure.  Per FM Kim: \"If the Trump administration takes an approach to the DPRK-U.S. summit with sincerity for improved DPRK-U.S. relations, it will receive a deserved response from us. However, if the U.S. is trying to drive us into a corner to force our unilateral nuclear abandonment, we will no longer be interested in such dialogue and cannot but reconsider our proceeding to the DPRK-U.S. summit.\" The term \"reconsider\" is quite mild in view of the North's standard approach of hyperbolic and outlandish threats, and can be read as more of a veiled threat than a foregone conclusion. Interestingly, neither South Korea nor the military drills are mentioned in the statement, and it's important here not to conflate the demands the North makes of the South (the return of defectors, etc.) with those they make of the US. Although the two are somewhat linked, a downturn in relations with the South does not preclude the North from going forward with the US, and indeed, such a \"divide and conquer\" approach to the allies would be inline with their established strategy. Kim further goes on to say that \"We have already stated our intention for denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and made clear on several occasions that precondition for denuclearization is to put an end to anti-DPRK hostile policy and nuclear threats and blackmail of the United States.\" (As a caveat, it must be pointed out the phrase \"denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula\" is a term the North has thrown around quite a bit over the past 30 years to refer to both the North's nuclear disarmament as well as for the US to remove South Korea from its nuclear umbrella, a condition that is a non-starter for the US). In a similar vein, on Friday the South Korean left-leaning daily Hankyoreh, citing the KCNA, reported that Kim Jong Un presided over a meeting of the Korean Worker's Party's Central Military Commission to discuss Kim's proposed defense reforms for \"channeling all capabilities into building a socialist economy.\u201d The meeting also included the reshuffling, appointment, and replacing of key personnel. This is consistent with the North's actions since the beginning of the year and show that for the time being, Pyongyang is still in \"peace mode.\" Taken together, these three pieces of evidence are consistent with the hypothesis that everything is still on track, but it is important to be cautious that one is not force-fitting or rationalizing evidence to fit a hypothesis, rather than letting the evidence in total determine the hypothesis. It could still be true that Trump intends to cancel, or is at least vacillating, and that my explanation above is precisely the type of rationalization I am seeking to avoid. A crucial indicator will be tomorrow's meeting between Trump and Moon in which Moon is likely to try to allay Trump's concerns and reassure that he didn't oversell Kim's commitments. I shall leave my forecast unchanged pending futher evidence. https://mobile.nytimes.com/2018/05/20/us/politics/trump-north-korea-nuclear.html http://www.uriminzokkiri.com/index.php?lang=eng&ftype=document&no=11309 http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_northkorea/845380.html"], [21884, "2018-05-22T01:21:21Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.64, 0.31], ""], [37488, "2018-05-22T00:51:12Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.65, 0.35], "Here's the question I keep thinking about: If Trump & Kim don't end up meeting in July (and it's postponed short term or indefinitely), can Kim get what he needs from his neighbors (SKorea, China, others) what he can't get from the US - some economic wiggle room with a slow dismantling or negotiated reduction in nuclear testing/expansion?  I don't see Japan jumping for this since they will probably rely more and more on the US being the closest to DPRK and their possible missile attacks.  But S. Korea has a strong national motivation to see if Kim means what he says and take it in good faith and hope they don't take a huge loss.  And China has very little need to worry about what the US will do if Trump and Kim don't meet.  A year ago I'd have said that no way would negotiations of any kind continue (outside of DPRK and China) if the US wasn't involved, but Trump is moving up the timeline of power shifts 5 or 10 years into the near present since he won't really play by anyone else's game but his own.  And I think that Kim has reason to hold out for what he wants (less pressure, more ceremony and hope) or even to pull back and get the US into a less aggressive bargaining position (less aggressive than Trump was last week, certainly).  But if there's a real possibility that regional powers would entertain private negotiations without a big summit, I wonder if Kim's best choice isn't to pull back and dither until the summit doesn't happen and other communication lines become open.  Big if.  East Asia policy without the US is tricky, and the precedent will be hard to buck. So I'd guess the realistic chances of such a thing happening are less than 10-20, or less.  Also, Trump really wants the summit and probably will keep working toward it without publicly backing down in any direct way.  North Korea still wants the talks, or the plans for talks, or they'd have backed out with a hard line already.  And their delays in responding to US/Trump comments are just slow enough that I feel like it's more maneuvering than hard line response.   https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-usa-southkorea/with-north-korea-summit-on-shaky-ground-trump-to-press-south-korean-leader-idUSKCN1IM26R https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/21/politics/trump-north-korea-south-korea-moon/index.html"], [37512, "2018-05-22T00:12:50Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.4, 0.6], ""], [176, "2018-05-21T23:33:20Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], "This just in:\nNorth Korea\u2019s warning of a possible withdrawal from the summit is seen as an effort to test Trump\u2019s willingness to make concessions on his demands for Pyongyang\u2019s denuclearization, the U.S. official said. \u201cIt\u2019s straight out of North Korea\u2019s playbook,\u201d the official said.\nRetrieved from: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-usa-southkorea/with-north-korea-summit-on-shaky-ground-trump-to-press-south-korean-leader-idUSKCN1IM26R More from that channel: \nOther U.S. officials have privately expressed concern that Moon, eager to make progress with the North, may have overstated Kim\u2019s willingness to negotiate in good faith over the dismantling of his nuclear arsenal.

As a result, North Korea was one of the most economically viable Eastern Bloc states until the 1990s. This pattern of behavior carried over into the post-Cold War years when the late Kim and then his son Kim Jong Il discovered they could just as easily play the US and South Korea off each other, especially when Seoul had a liberal government that was eager to improve inter-Korean relations and Washington had a more hawkish, conservative regime. Typically, the North would accomplish this by reaching an agreement on paper with the allies in exchange for concessions and then, once those concessions came into effect, pulling out of that agreement on the pretext of novel demands such as the cessation of all KORUS military drills or for the South Korean government to censor conservative anti-North Korea activists and defectors, demands the North knew the South would be unable to fulfill. Another frequently deployed tactic was to manufacture a crisis and then demand a reward for deescalation. Thus, North-South and North-US relations have taken on a cyclical characteristic in which periods of controlled hostility alternate with periods of relative peace, but always pulling back from the brink whenever the situation gets too close to either pole. The theory that best explains this historical evidence is that Pyongyang's strategists favor neither peace nor war but rather maintenance of a status quo of semi-hostility in order to continue to justify the country's seige mentality and it's continuous failure to provide for the material well-being of its citizens.  The recent Panmunjeom Summit was Kim Jong Un's first major \"peace offensive\" since taking and consolidating power in 2011. While the warmth and humanity he displayed was certainly a calculated propaganda move to win over hearts and minds in the South and the rest of the world, because of the novelty of the situation there was and still is good reason to be somewhat cautiously optimistic (or at least remain openminded) that perhaps this time will be a genuine break with past behavior. But as many NK analysts have pointed out, the summit was long on feel-good symbolism and short on substance and the final declaration was more or less just a rehashing of the same ambiguous boilerplate that came out of the previous two North-South summits.  Despite this week's threatening rhetoric to \"suspend\" (but, it should be noted, not \"cancel\") high levels talks with the South and the US, both sides have a strong incentive to sit down and reach some sort of agreement: Trump, to bolster his reputation with his domestic audience during an election year (and feed his ego) and Kim, to get sanctions relief and other concessions (not to mention the propaganda value of sitting face-to-face with a US leader for a country that is self-obsessed with demonstrating its status as a \"great power\" on the global stage) . It is also worth pointing out that North Korean propaganda is typically comprised of shrill hyperbole and exaggeration and they rarely carry out their threats. Nevertheless, Trump and Bolton's braggadocio aren't helping the situation as North Korea is extremely sensative to outside criticism and perceived slights and has a strong sense of national pride that could compel the government to walk away from the table (it should be noted that North Korea's system, unlike archetypal \"internationalist\" communist ideology, blends a leftist quasi-command economy with rightist race-based jingoism and chauvinistic Korean supremacy). It would be consistent with their past behavior for them to walk away while blaming Trump for \"creating a hostile environment\" in order to divide the South Korean public and rile up South Korea's many ethno-nationalistic liberals who are sympathetic to the North. Throughout his political career, SK president Moon Jae-in, a moderate liberal, has made no secret of his eagerness to strengthen North-South relations, and the North can take advantage of this by cancelling the summit and putting the onus on the US in the hope that Moon will be compelled to \"go it alone\" on North Korea so Kim can win unilateral subsidies for his moribund economy and, more importantly, break the KORUS alliance. Based on the North's well-established historical patterns, I am not optimistic that the North Korea issue will be solved any time soon, but assuming the past portends the future, it would be in Pyongyang's best interest for Kim to sit down with Trump in Singapore to gain some concessions, win status as a \"global statesman,\" and buy time before embarking on the next hostility cycle. And since presumably Pyongyang knows it will eventually back out of any agreement in the long run, it would cost them little but would gain them material rewards and big propaganda points domestically and in South Korea."], [28414, "2018-05-17T22:20:45Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [15471, "2018-05-17T21:04:50Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.6, 0.4], ""], [176, "2018-05-17T20:29:54Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], "And Bolton goes under the bus:\nTrump distanced himself from comments by his national security adviser John Bolton that North Korea cited when casting doubt on the summit, which is planned for June 12 in Singapore. \u201cNorth Korea is actually talking to us about times and everything else as though nothing happened,\u201d Trump said.

He then saw those deals discarded a year later, in 2008, by a newly elected president who sought closer ties with President George W. Bush, who had branded the North part of an \u201caxis of evil.\u201d\n. . . \nAs chief of staff during the Roh administration . . .  Mr. Moon did not participate in the negotiations with the North, led at the time by Kim Jong-il, the father of the current leader, or join Mr. Roh\u2019s overland visit to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. But he did help Mr. Roh organize those talks, held in October 2007. He has clearly taken to heart what he sees as the lessons of that stillborn peace initiative. One lesson was that advancing inter-Korean relations with generous offers of aid was a nonstarter so long as the United States remained locked in a standoff with the North over its nuclear weapons program. Another was that any deal with North Korea must be struck and carried out early in the terms of the South Korean and American presidents. This ensures that the agreement does not die with a change of governments and political ideologies in Seoul and Washington, as the 2007 agreement and other past deals did. \u201cWhen we look back, the most important thing is speed,\u201d Mr. Moon told the current North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, during their meeting last week in the Demilitarized Zone, the fortified border separating the two Koreas. During that meeting, Mr. Moon urged the North Korean to move quickly to make a deal with President Trump during their talks, expected later this month or next month. \u201cWe have to learn lessons from the past,\u201d Mr. Moon told Mr. Kim. That need for speed is apparent in the fast pace of diplomacy that appears to be leading to a first-ever summit meeting between the leaders of the United States and North Korea, who just a few months ago appeared on the brink of war.\n. . .\nHis approach to handling the United States is one of Mr. Moon\u2019s biggest departures from his predecessor, Mr. Roh. . . Mr. Moon appears to have concluded that Mr. Roh doomed his own peace deal at least in part by failing to get Mr. Bush to back it. Instead, Mr. Roh, fiery and blunt, had vowed not to \u201ckowtow to the Americans.\u201d  Since taking office last year, Mr. Moon has shown himself more sophisticated and accommodating in managing relations with Washington.\n. . . \nHe has closely consulted with the White House during the current rush of diplomacy. Mr. Moon has also been careful in public to credit Mr. Trump for making the current breakthroughs possible, saying that he deserves a Nobel Peace Prize. The need to bring in America also reflects hard-earned domestic political lessons. Mr. Moon saw Mr. Roh and Kim Dae-jung, the two presidents who championed what was called the Sunshine Policy of engagement with North Korea, fail as the North persisted in its weapons programs despite generous aid. Both died heartbroken men, with their legacy dismantled by their conservative foes, who ridiculed them as na\u00efve and pro-North Korean. \u201cOne thing South Korea has learned is that it cannot improve ties with North Korea without progress in denuclearizing North Korea,\u201d said Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul. Otherwise, he said, any deal \u201cwould be like building a house of cards.\u201d During his meeting with Mr. Kim at Panmunjom, Mr. Moon\u2019s highest priority appeared to be convincing the young North Korean dictator that he could create a better future by striking a deal with Washington to rebuild his country\u2019s economy in exchange for giving up his nuclear arsenal. Despite the spectacle of the two Korean leaders leisurely holding hands as they stepped across their nations\u2019 border, Mr. Moon and his aides compared his mission to \u201cwalking on this ice,\u201d and urged Mr. Kim to quickly sign and implement a deal while he and Mr. Trump were in office. \u201cI am still in the first year of my term,\u201d Mr. Moon told Mr. Kim during their meeting. \u201cI hope we can maintain this speed through my term.\u201d Mr. Moon\u2019s rush for an early deal is rooted in past experiences. In 1994, North Korea and the United States reached their first of many agreements on dismantling the North\u2019s nuclear program, then in its very early stages. Washington offered energy aid and promises of normalizing diplomatic and economic relations, but the accord unraveled after the United States dragged its feet because it did not expect the North Korean government to survive long past the collapse of the Soviet Union.\nImage North Korea also hedged its bets, secretly keeping a program to enrich uranium so it could one day build its own atomic bombs. In 2000, President Kim Dae-jung, the initiator of the Sunshine Policy, flew to Pyongyang to meet with Kim Jong-il, ushering in a period of d\u00e9tente that seemed to promise an end to hostilities on the peninsula. Investment and trade flourished, and families separated by the war were allowed to hold reunions. Kim Jong-il sent his trusted aide, Vice Marshal Jo Myong-rok, to the White House to ask President Bill Clinton to visit Pyongyang. However, Mr. Clinton decided he could not attempt so bold a diplomatic move at the end of his time in office, and instead sent his secretary of state, Madeleine Albright. The new opening with Washington closed after Mr. Bush took office in 2001. North Korea conducted its first nuclear test in 2006. \u201cAfter he stepped down, President Clinton visited Seoul and told President Kim Dae-jung how regrettable it was; he said if he had a little bit more time in office, he could have changed the course of the Korean Peninsula,\u201d said Lim Dong-won, a former aide to Mr. Kim, who attended the meeting. Mr. Roh, who replaced Kim Dae-jung, tried to keep the d\u00e9tente alive with his 2007 agreement on easing military tensions and increasing economic cooperation. But the deal, signed four months before Mr. Roh\u2019s term ended, was quickly overturned by Mr. Roh\u2019s conservative successor, Lee Myong-bak. Mr. Lee was eager to align himself with Mr. Bush, who sought to isolate the North with sanctions in the hopes it would surrender its nuclear weapons program, a strategy continued by President Barack Obama. So far, Mr. Moon\u2019s gambit seems to be winning broad support within South Korea. Opinion polls show his approval ratings surging, with some nine out of 10 South Koreans viewing the DMZ meeting as a success. Not all South Koreans are convinced, however. Hong Joon-pyo, leader of the main conservative opposition Korean Liberty Party, likened Mr. Moon to former Prime Minister Arthur Neville Chamberlain of Britain, who he said fell into Hitler\u2019s \u201ctrap of false peace.\u201d \u201cAfter being cheated eight times, did he still think for a ninth time that North Korea would not cheat this time?\u201d Mr. Hong said.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  Two statements in this article stand out for me:\n(1) One lesson was that advancing inter-Korean relations with generous offers of aid was a nonstarter so long as the United States remained locked in a standoff with the North over its nuclear weapons program, and (2) Mr. Moon urged the North Korean to move quickly to make a deal with President Trump during their talks, . . .. \u201cWe have to learn lessons from the past,\u201d Mr. Moon told Mr. Kim. I'm afraid that the first statement carries much more weight than the second.  I'm expecting that this meeting will be significantly delayed.

When the Chubby Despot crossed the DMZ, it was a big show, historical moment, a \"picture for posterity\" by Un. That meeting was also a pre-condition for Jong Un to meet Trump, a theater for South Koreans consumption. This shows the peace process started with the Koreans, not between US and North Korea and marginalize South Korea. However, the meeting this week would not do anything for North Korea, since whatever will be decided would be in June 12. North Korea lost nothing by canceling it. - North Korea needs an excuse to cancel the meeting this week with South Korea. Joint US-South Korea exercise is an excuse. North Korea knows that the exercise would be carried on, and acknowledged it in the invitation to meet with Trump (delivered by South Korean to the White House, before Trump accepted to meet). - The bellicose posture is for North Koreans consumption. The Fat King needs to show to his people he is not capitulating. If the US agrees to postpone the exercise until after June 12, North Korea scores. If the US still carry on the exercise, no big deal. They have been protesting such exercise for 65 years. - Kim Jong Un demanded a step-by-step tit-for-tat de-escalation, while the US held firm on a verifiable dismantling of the nuclear program before any aid or investment would come to North Korea. The US agreed to a summit, lending legitimacy to North Korea and shows Jong Un is a man of stature to the world and to North Koreans. Kim Jong Un crossed the DMZ to meet President Moon (a score for President Moon to South Koreans). The return of three hostages is a score for President Trump to Americans. In exchange, the Sixth Battle Group is pulled away from Korean coast. Will Trump give a concession to Jong Un by postponing the military exercise?  I believe this move by North Koreans is already discussed with Pompeio. This theory would be confirmed with US agree to postpone military exercise. On the other hand, this could be a pre-emptive move to either preventing a coup, to thwart one, or it already happened.

Rajaratnam School of International Studies told The Straits Times that a mid-June summit is more feasible, all things considered. \"If Singapore wishes to capitalise on the security infrastructure of the Shangri-La Dialogue, then June 4-6 is possible, but then President Trump runs right into the G-7 meeting after, which is hectic,\" he said. The day-long flight from Singapore to Canada must also be factored in, to give Mr Trump sufficient travel time. \"June 10 will be tight and quite unrealistic... Mr Trump's birthday is on June 14, and so this leaves us with the 15th as the earliest date.\" Analysts also noted the edge that Singapore has over Panmunjom as a summit site, given its neutrality.

Whether Trump and Kim keep their commitment to meet\n2. Whether they can find a mutually agreeable location\n3. Whether the meeting is within the 1 July '18 timeframe 1. Commitment\nBoth leaders have publicly announced their intention to meet and have the capability to meet. Trump has lots of political leaders as President (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_presidential_trips_made_by_Donald_Trump) despite it being said that he doesn't like to travel. Kim is naturally less well traveled but has shown an ability to meet Chinese and South Korean leaders and has hosted Denis Rodman more than once. Mike Pompeo's trip to North Korea shows seriousness.  While capable of meeting, both leaders seem at ease with changing their minds; it wasn't that long ago that Trump suggested the Rex Tillerson was wasting his time negotiating with North Korea (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/01/donald-trump-rex-tillerson-north-korea-time-wasting). \nKim has also changed significantly in rhetoric towards the US.  My feeling is that both leaders probably want to negotiate and have something to gain from negotiation, but neither leader wants to look desperate. 2. Location\nBoth leaders are conscious of public perception which may make it more difficult to find a mutually agreeable location. A US aircraft carrier looks good for Trump, but not Kim. Likewise having the US President summoned to Pyongyang makes Kim look good, but may be less palatable for Trump.\nI know Trump has announced that a location (and date) has been decided, but I remain skeptical (Trump announced that a bump-stock ban was nearly finished in early March and doesn't seem to have delivered). My feeling is that if it had really been finalised, the full details would probably have been announced.   3. Time\nThis seems to be the biggest threat to success (by the questions' criteria). The logistics, security concerns, agenda items, preparation (etc.) seem to present a possibility that it isn't held before 1 July '18. While Trump has announced May/June and has stated that a date has been decided, I have the same skepticism as above regarding the location.  I'm going with the current probabilities:\nBoth leaders keep their commitment (75%)\nA mutually agreeable location is available (80%)\nThe meeting is before 1 July '18 (50%)\nGiving a 30% chance of a meeting.

Unsure when in June though - likelihood the meeting happens before July 1 = 95% x 78% = 74.1%\n- likelihood the meeting does not happen before July 1 = 1 - 74.1% = 25.9% Feedback always welcome.  share below:)"], [1333, "2018-05-05T14:51:17Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.65, 0.0, 0.15, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.15], ""], [1639, "2018-05-05T14:13:59Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.9, 0.0], "Singapore is the last I heard!"], [43311, "2018-05-05T14:07:08Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], "Comment deleted on Oct 07, 2019 07:32PM UTC"], [43311, "2018-05-05T14:03:37Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], "Comment deleted on May 05, 2018 02:05PM UTC"], [691, "2018-05-05T12:25:57Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.55, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.33, 0.12], "The latest Twit suggests there will be an announcement on this topic soon.

While Mr. Trump flanked both China and Japan in the issue, Mr. Trump still wants South Korea somewhat in driver seat. That means historical meeting between Kim and Moon needs to happen. I would want to see that event before putting further down the \"No\" chance.\nThe announcement of Pompeio under-the-cover-of-the-night travel to North Korea coincides with the Trump-Abe Summit in Mar-a-Lago, FL. That means Trump waited to brief Abe first, either to rub in the face of Abe (Japan 's sidelined in the US-North Korea talk rendered Japan irrelevant), or is an opening for Abe to host Trump-Kim summit to save face. Similarly, with regard to China. Mr. Trump out-flanked China here. While Korea reunification won't happen overnight, if official end to Korean War is achieved with denuclearization of North Korea, China will lose a big chunk of influence and prestige. So I give some chance for the Trump-Kim summit to happen in China. Kim's trip to meet Xi last month shows that China would know about US-North Korea talk, as Kim asked Xi for permission.  It is still hard to know where the meeting would take place. However, I would rule out some places:\n- Russia: increasingly irrelevant in international scene, especially Trump's Rusal sanction hit Putin oligarchs hard in the pocket book. Russia won't have any say in North Korea. They used to have some say in the past because North Korea wants more ally in talk with other nations.\n- Mongolia: maybe in 13th century;\n- International Water: only to sign surrender treatise;\n- DMZ: no serious diplomacy summit has ever happened in DMZ.

Doubt it'll be Vietnam though, Commie hell-hole and China patron state that it is.

Don't think HungryKorea has a helicopter that can do more than 200nm safely and reliably out to sea. So China would have to lend some assets (and risk not getting them back). Or USAF or USN have to go in and pick Tubby and his Sychophantic Entourage up at the DMZ, which would make him look like the total cuck that he is.  What a time to be alive.  I noticed when a few Russian politicians did a propaganda stunt in Damascus with Assad after the strikes there were some 'Kim-style Guidance notetaking' going on by a handful of hired Sychophantic Entourage. Anyone see it? The Ginger Amish Ruski got prime seating. Coincidence?  Birds of a feather. Syrian military was involved with DPRK and it became news when a whole bunch died in some hazardous spill and Assad had to send a plane to bring them home in body bags. Moslems and 24 hour burial and all that jazz you know.  They both have no real air force. What a coincidence.  I'm now really looking forward to how it all goes down since I was at 85% No. Trump seems to want to go ahead with it, so maybe it'll be Kim that reneges or chickens out of it - once he realises his widdle armoured choo-choo train can't get him there.

So this is unlikely but not impossible: 5% The other unlikely option is in international waters. I didn't exclude it simply based on the \"closeness to NK\" variable, but KJU should feel really uneasy on a ship as he doesn't trust the US and its allies and all of those have capable navies. The other two options are DMZ and China. In terms of probability I think these are more or less a coin flip. I give a preference to China as it can provide more comfort and provide better security (i.e. father away from an actual front line). The big question is: How likely is a meeting between DJT and KJU in the first place? At the moment I'm giving it better than even but not much more.

One day maybe, but before I up my odds, there has to be a formal invitation, acceptance, and a play date in the books.   *Caveat: If Kim Jong Un suddenly promises to allow Trump to license his name for the very best luxury condos & hotels in NK, Trump and family will be on a plane to NK tomorrow."], [39937, "2018-03-22T06:53:57Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [40702, "2018-03-22T06:50:09Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.9], "- A formal invite was never extended by either side.\n- Kim Jong-Un has not left the country since taking control - or he's only left maybe once.\n- There is to much paranoia/security risks involved traveling to a neutral territory. \n"], [55834, "2018-03-22T03:43:15Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.05, 0.0, 0.05, 0.85], "Neither party has enough to gain for a meeting in the others country and Kim will not travel out of the country for fear he will be deposed."], [51261, "2018-03-22T03:10:20Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.05, 0.0, 0.2, 0.1, 0.15, 0.4, 0.0], "Since prior to he olympics communications have opened up.

Like a moth drawn to a flame, I am drawn to Good Judgment's international affairs random number generator. Base rate analysis: How long has Un been in power, and how often has he left the country?  Un became supreme leader December 17, 2011 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong-un).  Un was a student in Switzerland, and, while there, he may have traveled a bit in Western Europe.  There are claims he traveled to China in the early 1990s with his mother.  There is an unverified claim that he traveled to China in 2009 or 2010.  After attaining power, he was scheduled to visit Iran (2012) and Russia (2015), but neither trip took place.  Based on this, I am inclined to shade my predictions to Un will not leave the country.  I can rationalize this as a lack of confidence about his potential return, but I have only a general intuition for this based on (IMHO) unreliable Western and North Korean news sources. Who are the various players?  The US and North Korea are not the only players in this negotiation.  South Korea, China, Russia and Japan have direct interests.  These are the Six Parties (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-party_talks).  I consider North Korea, South Korea, and Japan to be regional players with fairly clear endgames.  The US, China, and Russia are global players and have more complex goals. North Korea: Un is the North Korean state, and Supreme Leader Un wants to exist.  His logic is that he has to have WMDs to do this.  Based on my reading, they want to accomplish this with nuclear weapons and a second strike capability on the US mainland (missiles or submarine launched missiles).  (Note what happened to Gaddafi in Libia after he gave up his WMD program; see what happened in Ukraine after they gave up their nuclear weapons.  Un has.)  He may have an auxiliary goal of food shipments or a relaxation of UN sanctions.  (Un may also have the stretch goal of uniting the entire Korean peninsula under his control.  This would be a very long goal.) South Korea: South Korea would prefer not to have a war, nuclear or otherwise.  My opinion is they expect North Korea to collapse under its own weight at some point.  South Korea may have a stretch goal of uniting the Korean peninsula as a democratic republic. Japan: Japan\u2019s goals are pretty much aligned with South Korea\u2019s.  They would also like to see missile tests over their airspace end.  The North Koreans have also ran some unfriendly operations in Japan (kidnapping, drug running, etc), and they want it stopped. United States: The US has been directly threatened by North Korea by their missile program combined with nuclear weapons\u2019 tests.  The stated goal of the US is a nuclear-free Korean peninsula. China: North Korea is a neighbor and client of the PRC.  Actions by the North Koreans and persuasion by the US almost had THAAD missiles in South Korea.  (This was stopped by Chinese sanctions on South Korea in 2017.)  OTOH, China has sometimes been served by North Korea\u2019s unpredictability. Russia:  Russia has a border with North Korea, and has wanted to build a natural gas pipeline through North Korea to South Korea.  Russia opposes whatever the US wants.  Just the way it is. Others:  Sweden and Finland have offered their services as mediators  I don\u2019t see any outsiders speeding the process up because of North Korean diplomatic limitations. The main sticking point is North Korea\u2019s desire for nuclear weapons, and the US\u2019s desire for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.  It doesn\u2019t appear there is a middle ground. Next, I considered what steps have to happen before a meeting between President Trump and Supreme Leader Un.  First, something must come from such a meeting.  This implies negotiations prior to any meeting by lower level functionaries, and substantial concessions from both sides.  (Nixon only went to China after Kissinger paved the way.)  The US has a new Secretary of State, Micheal Pompeo.  He is getting his arms around the State Department at this point, so he has to balance priorities.  Considering all this, and assuming rational players, I expect a series of meetings between diplomats before something concrete could happen between Trump and Un.  Given the history of this region, about 3 months until expiration does not seem long enough to accomplish this. But what if I don\u2019t consider rational players?  Supreme Leader Un can do a number of things that will make the probabilities of a meeting lower.  For example, if he tests more nuclear weapons, chances go down.  If Un is quiet with his weapons testing, chances go up.  If Un asks for humanitarian aid in the form of food, and he gets it, then chances go up for a meeting.  President Trump can afford to wait under any circumstances.  Based on how I observe President Trump\u2019s negotiating style, he makes an extreme offer first (anchoring his opponent), and then walks it back.  If I see the US floating a WMD freeze on the Korean peninsula, I would raise the chances of a meeting.  (While this sounds stupid, I wonder where Dennis Rodman is, since he is a friend of Un\u2019s.  Rodman could actually be a go-between in the early stages of the negotiations.) Put in terms poker, North Korea is short-stacked but has enough to last more deals.  The US and China are the big stacks.  The US is the table captain and can force the action. Here is my logic for my selections.  It is physically possible for Trump and Un to meet anywhere in the world, so my minimum probability value is 1%.  I have bumped up the Korean DMZ based on historical precedence and the proximity to North Korea.

It's unlikely the US would invite Kim onto its soil. International waters is logistically difficult, as any government vessel is considered sovereign territory of that nation (i.e., meeting on a US aircraft carrier is equivalent to meeting on a US installation overseas, which is considered US sovereign territory, meaning its the same as stepping foot on US soil for legal reasons). Somewhere else, maybe, but then you're getting into the \"who's friends with whom\" game, and that's can get unnecessarily complicated.  Personnally, I think some of his advisors will try to prevent him from meeting Kim before July, especially if the US backs out of the JCPOA. The disarray that would cause would give an upper hand to the DPRK negotiators, who would likely meet the US ones before Trump and Kim meet. Additionally, the US does not appear to have a coherent strategy and end-state for DPRK, other than \"no nukes.\" So, is the US prepared to lift all sanctions on DPRK in exchange for a freeze of DPRK's nuclear weapons program, a la Iran and JCPOA (which the GOP raged against and Trump might pull out of), or are there limits to the concessions? Does ROK have a role, and a say, in negotiations? The EU? China? Russia? The next couple months would be better spent figuring out the desired end-state and strategy to get there instead of the logistics of a meeting.
