Minister\u00a0Naci Agbal told local media the huge hike in military spending\u00a0reflects a \"war economy.\"\u00a0He cited\u00a0\"geopolitical risks and the budget increases these risks require. Turkey was in 2016 the world's 18th-largest military spender, with an estimated 2016 outlay of $14.8 billion, according to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute\u2019s (SIPRI) Fact Sheet .  It's GDP then was 858 bn USD, that totals to approx. 1.72% military expenditure of GDP. 2017\naccording to Moodys a 3.7% growth is expected:    858     890bn USD 2018\naccording to Moodys a 3.2% growth is expected: :    890     1070 bn USD\nabout $26 billion will be spent on military defense expenditures, out of a total national budget of $195 billion.\u00a0That amount is likely to put Turkey in SIPRI\u2019s top 15 defense spenders in 2018. but from where to finance?\nMinister\u00a0Naci Agbal said that\u00a0of about $7.2 billion in extra revenues to be derived from surcharges on vehicles, fuel, real estate\u00a0and personal income taxes, about $2.3 billion will be directly allocated to the defense industry.\u00a0 26bn out of 1070 = 2.4% !  (?)  these are just my estimations based on the official number estimates.  High very high, difficult to believe.  But then, Turkey has spent in the past ( not too far back) much more than that %! so it could be plausible\nBut I also ask; despite the overwhelmingly positive outlook Turkey get for 2017, where is is the economy going in 2018 truly?  Is 3.2% truly feasible?\nThere is a contradiction; either overwhelming growth 3.2% or \"war economy\" as stated by the Minister, if it is a \u201cwar economy\u201d I can't see such a growth feasible and then the question is;  where shall these additional taxes come from? Still for the time I stick to my forecast of 6-8, inclusive nations, since the quoted expenditure report  will include data for 2018.  That means it will be issued when?   Who can help?

Estimating that the first 2018 estimate will be in June 2018.  \n- US is advocating for higher spending with an emphasis on the agreed 2% target. 2016 actual figures were published in March 2017.\n- US declining spend does not seem to justify the request (US spend 2009 to 2017 estimate): 5.29% (of GDP), 4.81%, 4.77%, 4.42%, 4.08%, 3.78%, 3.58%, 3.61%, 3.58%.  US congress planned a decade of defense budget cuts that have reduced spend as a % of GDP.\n- Easter European countries are targeting the 2% mark as they see benefit for defense against Russia and will benefit from additional NATO spend. Case for a minimum of 3 countries: US and Greece are consistently over 2% (Greece from 2014 to 2016 spent 2.21%, 2.32% and 2.38%.  UK also seems safe for the moment with recent spend at 2.19%, 2.08%, 2.18% and 2017 est. at 2.14%. The changing political situation in the UK could have a negative effect on this number if a new election changes spending priorities before next June's estimate. Case for #4: Romainia has committed to spend 2% of GDP over the next decade (past 3 years were 1.35%, 1.45% and 1.41%, and the 2017 estimate is for 2.02%.  Even if the 2017 spend is lower than 2%, Romania will stir be well on the way to meeting the target in 2018. Case for #5: Estonia, benefits from the build up against Russia and recent spend of 1.96%, 2.06%, 2.15% and 2017 estimate of 2.14%, make this a safe forecast as well. Case for #6: Poland: Recent spend 1.85%, 2.22%, 2.00% and 2017 estimate of 2.01%, leaves some room for doubt, although the NATO estimate may be positive and reflect the 2% level until the facts prove otherwise. Case for #'s 7 & 8: Lithuania (0.88%, 1.14%, 1.49% and 2017 est. at 1.77%) and Latvia (0.94%, 1.04%, 1.44% and 2017 est. at 1.70%).  NATO expects both countries to meet the 2% goal in 2018, suspect the 2018 forecast will reflect the expectation even if both fall slightly behind pace.  Case for #9: Montenego: Prior year spend was 1.5%, 1.42%, 1.49% with 2017 estimated at 1.66%. Possible.  Turkey: Cirrently estimated at 1.52% for 2017, given the Kurdish /IS and Counter terrorism efforts it seems possible, except that the high level of current spend (in total dollars) would need a 33% increase on an already large military. https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2017/06/30/defense-spending-increased-significantly-among-nato-allies/"], [5386, "2017-09-29T06:42:55Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.85, 0.0], ""], [39740, "2017-09-28T21:50:05Z", [0.3, 0.5, 0.15, 0.05], ""], [691, "2017-09-28T21:25:34Z", [0.0, 0.07, 0.93, 0.0], ""], [40387, "2017-09-27T23:24:23Z", [0.95, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2017-09-26T21:23:11Z", [0.0, 0.07, 0.93, 0.0], ""], [3363, "2017-09-26T15:57:11Z", [0.04, 0.29, 0.64, 0.03], ""], [28414, "2017-09-26T10:50:17Z", [0.0, 0.25, 0.75, 0.0], ""], [14493, "2017-09-26T10:47:49Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.95, 0.0], "Trump's negotiating skills have made it difficult for any country that had not already planned to raise defense spending to do so.

Recent tensions are mounting between Moscow and the land of crisp lettuce due to a missile defense system placed in the region. Putin says Romania is in his \"crosshairs.\" And since this country is the latest to meet the 2% target, I'd say it's pretty likely to continue doing so.  Romania: 93%.\nI should check a few months from now to see whether tensions cool. I am not good at math, and drawing a tree diagram doesn't sound fun, so I'm just going to guesstimate my new forecast. If there was an 87% chance that more than 5 countries would meet the target in my first analysis, there's a 97% chance now that the new data is in.  In order for more than 8 to meet the target, all the above countries need to meet it, plus one more.
