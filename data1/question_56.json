It would shift focus and profits away from the show, and therefore while I believe that he has most likely already finished writing the book at some point in 2015, the book will be released around the time season 6 is finishing or perhaps even later.\nTo sum up, it is all about money at this point. Martin has nothing to lose by releasing later - he has his huge payout and royalties from the show regardless and people who were going to read the book will still read it. The makers of the show stand to lose a lot of money on the other hand should the book be released first, therefore this will not happen.

I'm hesitant to move too low given I don't really have any new information or a good sense of what the timeline should look like over the next 5 months.  That said, if he were going to be ready to release by May, then he already knows it, so does the publisher, and it would be surprising that that hasn't leaked yet. Many people have done interesting analysis (@jsheth, @grysu, others I think) of lead time for each book based on pg counts.  Do any long time fans have info on how early the leaks were for prior books?  Ideally 3 dates: a) first leak; b) announcement of release date; c) release date. Here we are forecasting c, presumably the qn will close upon b, and a may or may not exist.  I don't really have a great sense for the \"base rate\" of a and b, and I haven't seen if it has been laid out by others, but it strikes me as probably the most relevant knowable info here. For the last book it was:  a) ??; b) Mar 3 2011; c) July 12 2011 (http://www.avclub.com/article/george-rr-martin-confirms-july-2011-release-date-f-52685).   Again, I don't have older books, or any evidence of a leak prior to Mar 3 from that book, but I guess it leads me to believe if he's done, he'll probably confirm a release date publicly well in advance (~4 months in that case).  In this case, we'd have to expect January at the latest for the public announcement date*.  I  would also be surprised if there weren't any leaks or a build up in crappy tabloid stories leading up to that.  It's pretty hotly anticipated, and by the point that he can announce a date, lots of people would have to be in the know...   That means really our timeline to the official announcement is probably something like ~6-7 weeks at most and we should probably start expecting leaks or \"hints\" late this month, or maybe in early January if its happening (again, if it leaks before the official announcement, I don't know if it will, I would just guess it might).  Instead, when he is doing live fan events or writing blog posts (which it seems like he is doing all the time) we are getting almost nothing.   So, given all that, I'm reducing my estimate to 15%, a bit below consensus and well below my prior level.

I would assume it may take even longer since Winds of Winter is the penultimate book in the series and would think that GRRM may spend more time bringing the various plot lines to a conclusion.

The TV season has regularly come out at the beginning of April each year.  I think it could be delayed some this year, but I don't think HBO wants to risk a long delay since there is a risk that it turns off fans and then you get into summer.  GRRM has said that he has highlighted the major plot points and ending in case something happened to him.  In addition, the TV show has diverged from the book in a number of ways already, so I don't think the book is a bottleneck for the TV show.

Given the release schedule of the seasons of Game of Thrones being pretty regularly in early April, that would make the prediction a firm no. I'll start my prediction there. However, a big problem with this approach is that the TV series has come out since the last book, so how that affects George RR Martin's writing is not being incorporated. I would guess that it makes him less productive, but there is the chance that wider success has put pressure on him to focus. Also, as the series has gone on, there has been a lot of \"banked\" material which was cut from earlier books. As this should be the penultimate book, he might start using some of that (also, pressure from the publisher while the programme is popular). I'm going to think about how to incorporate this, and update the forecast accordingly.

GRRM has been avoiding press and conferences lately in an attempt to complete more work, so perhaps he is dedicated to completing this book as he mentioned, before the TV show airs. Might HBO delay the release of the show to coincide with the release of the novel?
