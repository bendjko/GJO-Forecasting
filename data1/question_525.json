With the budget passed, the state was able to issue bonds and pay down some of its accruing obligations. The bonds have a much lower interest rate (3.5% vs 12+%) than the accrued obligations.  4. With the approved increase in tax rates and lower bond interest rates, the state budget outlook has improved from earlier in the year when all three rating agencies put the state on watch. While the state's budget is still not entirely stable, it seems highly unlikely it will worsen enough over the next two plus months to warrant a downgrade.  5. From an outside perspective, no state has ever received a junk rating. The rating agencies would need to make a substantial argument to make Illinois the first. They might have that argument sometime in 2018 or 2019 if finances deteriorate, but it seems unlikely they will have it before the end of the year.

I don\u2019t believe the ratings agencies are motivated by financial considerations only or I would forecast differently. 2) There has been no news since July.  Maybe nobody is looking.  Maybe nobody cares.  However, the citizens of Illinois are not being prepared for what might be coming either.  No public pressure is being placed on politicians to divert the mess.  Two dogs that haven\u2019t barked. 3) Whether it is ratings agencies or equity analysts, they tend to be late.  The classic example is the Enron failure.  There were recommendations to buy all the way to about 90% down from the high.  The ratings agencies will cut Illinois a break long past what anyone would believe is reasonable.  A counter-argument is we may have reached that point. 4) I know a banker who explained bank failures to me.  The heads of bank on the verge of failure know how desperate their situation is, but for the most part the employees or customers do not.  FDIC waits until they have everything ready: the examiners, large amounts of cash, and the plan for other local banks to come into the picture as backstops.  On a Friday afternoon, at closing time, the bank is shut down.  The examiners work through the weekend, and the bank usually can open early the next week.  Disruption in minimized.  Given the situation in Puerto Rico, the entire US Government is not prepared for the implications of a downgrade to Illinois\u2019 credit.  Nothing will happen until they are ready.  And yes, I believe the ratings agencies pay very careful attention to the desires of the government.  While a credit downgrade is not the same as bankruptcy, in this case it will hit Illinois hard because of additional loan costs.  I see no evidence of such preparation. 5) What is the evidence against my position? 5A) Illinois is overdue in bills to the tune of about $6.7B.  Their creditors would obviously like to get 100% on the dollar.  If some creditor becomes first mover and demands payment, there could be a preference cascade that would force a downgrade or worse. 5B) Elections will be held in 2018.  The governor is up for reelection.  The present governor was elected by \u201cdown-state\u201d voters and has been at odds with the state legislature (both parties) and Chicago officials.

In all 3 cases, Illinois is close to the rating of junk status, and a negative change could push them over the edge. However Illinois has recently passed a budget for 2018 that makes their future outlook more positive. (http://money.cnn.com/2017/07/06/investing/illinois-budget-deal-house-override/index.html).  Looking at each agency, the most recent rating from S&P, affirmed Illinois rating at BBB- with a stable outlook on July 12th. (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-illinois-ratings/illinois-avoids-downgrade-to-junk-as-sp-affirms-bbb-minus-rating-idUSKBN19X2PW). Since that was in July, it is possible that S&P will update this before the end of the year, but due to the stable rating, I judge it unlikely that they will lower this rating until seeing how the 2018 budget is implemented. I give S&P a 10% chance of lowering the rating in the next 2 months. Moody's latest update to Illinois credit rating was also in July, at Baa-3 with a negative outlook. This is potential to update before the end of the year, and with the negative outlook, still possible to have that lowered to junk status. (https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-confirms-Illinois-Baa3-GO-and-related-ratings-affecting-32--PR_904132827). However with the recent budget being passed, it is unlikely that this will be lowered unless there is significant issues in setting the budget for 2018. I give this a 20% chance of downgrade.  Fitch's latest rating was also in july giving illinois a BBB with a negative outlook. (https://www.fitchratings.com/site/pr/1026604). Fitch is likely to reasses this rating before year end, and with a negative rating it is possible that it will drop. However, it would have to drop 2 ratings to hit junk status which seems very unlikely, especially considering the budget that was passed by illinois. I give this a 0% chance of reaching junk status by 1/1/2018 To be yes, the rating would have to be downgraded by any of the 3 bureaus.

Pardon my ignorance.  Maybe I should try Chrome. To matuschoma: Yeah, good point.  Rating agencies publish \"1 Year Transition Probability Matrix\" which gives probabilities for transitions from one \"rating state\" to another.  (If you are familiar with Markov Chains, this is _that_ matrix.)  (See http://media.spglobal.com/documents/SPGlobal_Ratings_Article_13+April+2017_Annual+Corporate+Default+Study+and+Rating+Transitions.pdf, page 56)  The S&P probability of a change in rating in one year from BBB to BB from S&P is 3.2%, and from BBB to B is 0.26%.  The probability of being unchanged in rating in one year is 88%.  Based on poking around, the other agencies have similar figures.  This will skew the distribution toward less than 50% probability. This supports your comment.  However, there is a bit of gamesmanship on my part.  From past experience, I believe the ratings agencies will not downgrade in November or December.  This leaves August, September, October for the bad news to hit.  I don't think Fitch will lead on this rating because it is the smallest of the Big Three, and is more of a follower.  S&P last rated Illinois in September 2016 and I expect them to re-rate this September.  If they don't, I will lower my probabilities in order to recover my Brier score. To Seancarranco: Thanks for the link.  Because Moody's just rated Illinois, I don't think they will re-rate them within the <180 day period left in the question.  They could have downgraded them to junk in June, but decided not to.  I kind of think they are trying to give them extra chances.  S&P is another matter: they rated them one step above junk last year, and I think they will take the lead if Illinois crosses the threshold to junk status.  Again, if it doesn't happen by end of October, it will happen after the question expires (IMO).  In that case, I will lower my score drastically."], [18846, "2017-07-12T13:58:30Z", [1.0], ""], [29145, "2017-07-12T12:58:15Z", [0.59], ""], [14761, "2017-07-12T06:44:39Z", [0.2], ""], [992, "2017-07-12T02:46:52Z", [0.6], "Illinois has suffered numerous downgrades from various S&P, Moody's and Fitch since 2009.

Just giving my thought process. There are less than 180 days left in this question.  I assume each company has a committee that meets to decide and announce credit rating changes.  It appears there are preferred months for issuing new ratings.  Since Moody\u2019s just downgraded, I do not expect them to immediately downgrade again within the end date of the question.  That leaves S&P and Fitch, and the months of August, September, and October for a new announcement. Because Good Judgment Project has arranged the options in deciles, I will try to come up with a probability distribution also based on deciles.  Once I have this, my prediction will be the median of the distribution. 1. No state in the US has ever had a junk bond rating.  The City of Chicago already has a junk-rating.  The Chicago Public Schools are deep in junk territory.  Illinois Universities are also facing downgrades, but are not at junk levels yet, except for Northeastern Illinois.  But I believe the ratings agencies are not only driven by objective facts but by political realities.  Rating Illinois at that level will be a hardship for the state and so there may be a tendency to give them extra time.  I call these considerations a wash and the distribution is unchanged. 2. Demographics hurts Illinois.  The population of Illinois is going down, therefore the tax-base is shrinking.  Because of tax increases, people who can are leaving the state.  In 2016, Illinois lost more people than any other state.  The state is also divided in terms of political apportionment.  Northern Illinois is dominated by Chicago and is controlled by the Democratic Party.  Southern Illinois is Republican.  The governor is Republican.  The state legislature has raised taxes over the governor\u2019s veto.  I do not expect a credible plan to come from the political leaders of Illinois. 3. Higher interest rates are demanded for Illinois bonds.  The bond traders are already ahead of the rating agencies in this regard.  What the credit rating agencies do may be a moot point.  Spending cuts may not be an option either.  There are court orders and consent decrees that force state spending.  The pension obligations are also written into law.  Based on this, redo the distribution again. The median of this probability distribution is in the 50-60% bin."], [22264, "2017-07-12T01:53:51Z", [1.0], ""], [706, "2017-07-11T23:59:14Z", [0.75], "No hope for progress in the next month and then school begins again and every year it seems the teachers' union forces legislators to reconcile their paper budget with reality.
