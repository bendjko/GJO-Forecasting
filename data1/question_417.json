The framework, invented by Ralph Nelson Elliott, posits that each bull market rally goes through five different \"waves\" before a pullback occurs, with the first, third, and fifth waves moving upward while pullbacks happen in the second and fourth waves. According to Gordon, the market is currently in that fifth and final upward wave. While the S&P 500 continues to climb, as it did in the first and third waves, once it finishes its current \"trend channel,\" the market will begin to fall. \"At the current angle of ascent, I'm not calling a top [in the short term],\" he said Monday on CNBC's \"Trading Nation.\" \"We could have a bit more of a rally, potentially reaching the 3,000 mark in the S&P 500.\" That would represent a 20 percent rise from Monday's closing price. Once the S&P does reach 3,000 the index could be set to come crashing down to 1,800, Gordon said. That would represent a 40 percent drop from those peaks.\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/25/classic-theory-predicts-rally-then-huge-drop-for-the-sp-500-technician.html"], [691, "2017-11-29T16:51:11Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2017-11-28T21:59:56Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-11-28T20:31:47Z", [0.01], ""], [30364, "2017-11-28T19:11:56Z", [0.0], ""], [38840, "2017-11-28T17:37:29Z", [0.0], ""], [32721, "2017-11-28T14:30:00Z", [0.05], "Investor confidence high, Energy prices low, Drawdown catalysts are energy related"], [23350, "2017-11-28T09:46:27Z", [0.01], ""], [41886, "2017-11-28T09:39:54Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-11-28T00:47:03Z", [0.0], ""], [20044, "2017-11-27T14:49:19Z", [0.01], ""], [21884, "2017-11-27T03:59:14Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-11-27T02:09:14Z", [0.0], ""], [30369, "2017-11-26T22:34:21Z", [0.01], "Adjusting for time and historical placidity around Christmas"], [30364, "2017-11-26T14:42:04Z", [0.0], ""], [26267, "2017-11-26T13:36:50Z", [0.03], "Down on time lapsed.

The rule of thumb is that an inverted yield curve (short rates above long rates) indicates a recession in about a year, and yield curve inversions have preceded each of the last seven recessions (as defined by the NBER). One of the recessions predicted by the yield curve was the most recent one. The yield curve inverted in August 2006, a bit more than a year before the current recession started in December 2007. There have been two notable false positives: an inversion in late 1966 and a very flat curve in late 1998.\nhttps://www.clevelandfed.org/en/our-research/indicators-and-data/yield-curve-and-gdp-growth.aspx Q. What does the evidence say, in short? A.

Now most investors would argue that my comment supports the theory of an extreme drop, since the market has been so quiet. But I disagree.  Here is why: The S&P 500 drops 20% every 3.5 years, 15% drop once every 2 years, 10% drop once a year, and 5% drop 3 times per year. So far this year the S&P 500 hasn't dropped much more than 1.5% on a given day. In 2017 we have had on 3.0% decline and 3 other 2%+ declines. Last time we had a 5% drop was in August 2016. The last time we had a 15% drop was in November 2015, and the last time we saw a 20% drop was 2011.  So to compare to history: \n3 per year 5% drops - Actual is None. But we have had four 2% to 3% drops in 2017. NOT FORM FITTING\n1 per year 10% drop - Actual is none.  The last drop of 10% of more was in Nov 2015; so 2 years ago. NOT FORM FITTING\n1 per every 2 years 15% drop - Actual is 1 in the last two years. FORM FITTING\n1 per every 3.5 years 20% drop - Actual was in 2011. So 6 years ago. NOT FORM FITTING Going back through the data, a 20% drop is highly unlikely. Although the data indicates they happen every 3.5 years, that is not a consistent 3.5 years. The drop during the Great Recession was 53%+. Then in 2011 we dropped 21%. Since 2011 we haven't dropped more than 20% during any time period.  To achieve a 20% decline, there must be underlying issues with the fundamentals of the market. As of now, GDP growth, unemployment, interest rates, and corporate profits are generally positive and improving. As such, I don't see a large deterioration in the market to warrant a 20% happening in the next 37 days. \n"], [30364, "2017-11-07T00:20:58Z", [0.0], ""], [33818, "2017-11-06T21:25:01Z", [0.01], "There is a 1% historical likelihood of the S&P 500 moving down 20% within a span of 55 calendar days.

The most recent was in 2006 when Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve increased the Fed funds rate 400 basis points and the 10-year yield rose less than 50 basis points. Economists at the time dismissed this, saying \"this time it's different,\" and the economy is in better shape. \"I don't get the sense that there is any panic because firms have learned a lot since 2000 about being prudent,\" an analyst at Celent said in 2005. Oh, how they were wrong. \nThe Inverted Yield Curve Guide to Recession \nhttp://www.investopedia.com/news/inverted-yield-curve-guide-recession/ Q. What does the evidence say, in short? A. The difference between long-term and short-term interest rates (\"the slope of the yield curve\" or \"the term spread\") has borne a consistent negative relationship with subsequent real economic activity in the United States, with a lead time of about four to six quarters. The measures of the yield curve most frequently employed are based on differences between interest rates on Treasury securities of contrasting maturities, for instance, ten years minus three months. The measures of real activity for which predictive power has been found include GNP and GDP growth, growth in consumption, investment and industrial production, and economic recessions as dated by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). The specific accuracy of these predictions depends on the particular measures employed, as well as on the estimation and prediction periods. However, the results are generally statistically significant and compare favorably with other variables employed as leading indicators. For instance, models that predict real GDP growth or recessions tend to explain 30 percent or more of the variation in the measure of real activity. See Estrella and Hardouvelis (1991). The yield curve has predicted essentially every U.S. recession since 1950 with only one \"false\" signal, which preceded the credit crunch and slowdown in production in 1967. There is also evidence that the predictive relationships exist in other countries, notably Germany, Canada, and the United Kingdom. See Estrella and Mishkin (1997) and Bernard and Gerlach (1998). \nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/research/capital_markets/ycfaq.html#Q1"], [34377, "2017-10-10T16:25:50Z", [0.03], ""], [30364, "2017-10-10T12:37:59Z", [0.0], ""], [21884, "2017-10-10T05:54:50Z", [0.0], ""], [1333, "2017-10-09T23:15:03Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-10-09T20:45:09Z", [0.0], ""], [27367, "2017-10-09T16:22:59Z", [0.12], ""], [29609, "2017-10-09T10:11:40Z", [0.15], "As time is running out, this has become more unlikely.

By October 3rd, it had fallen by a little over 20%. We are talking a slow drip, to a sudden drop, of approximately 5 months' time. Going off of this historical reference as a recent data point, 6 months remain in 2017, thus there is a still a window of opportunity for a similar fall to occur. Ok, so probability is greater than 0%. But how much greater than 0%? Not too much, given the current bull market's penchant for the often-quoted from Warren Buffett \"...be greedy when others are fearful\" that seems to be on everyone's lips these days. The recent quick sell-off and subsequent re-buying of FAANG at a \"discount\" when Goldman Sachs released their report comparing FAANG to the previous tech bubble of 2000/2001 is an interesting example of how the quote above seems to be thrown around by a lot of newbie AND seasoned investors lately. Because of this, it seems to me that the market is likely to weather any small corrections or downturns that may result over the course of the year due to this renewed sense of confidence that even first-time investors are showing when these opportunities to buy stocks at a \"discount\" arise. So, if a slow drip is unlikely, that only leaves possibility of a sudden drop. The overconnectedness of stop-losses resulting from an initial sell-off by major players will quickly wipe a significant portion of the market's value due to tenuous emotional confidence within the market at the moment. Many investors claim to be emotionally strong to hold on and weather a drop, and then buy back the \"discounted\" stocks, but I think the recent FAANG scenario brought out a lot of anxiety investors are hiding with regards to wanting to secure the gains they've made over these last 8-9 years. If anyone reading this frequents online stock forums/messaging boards, they will know what I am referring to. Right after that report was published and people saw the markets open at a significant loss for the first time in a while, plenty of individuals online started to question their investments very quickly. I view it as a warning sign for things to come, when a sudden drop exceeds the emotional resistance of most investors.

Now assuming eight months left of the year (a slight oversimplification) we see that the SPX/GSPC returns a price return of minus 20% inside eight months in 4.5% of all calendar months. But conditioning on current valuation levels with CAPE at the time of writing @ 29.19, we see that in only six of 79 months (7.6% of cases) have markets been more expensive than currently in terms of Graham-Dodd/Shiller PE, with subsequent eight-month price return equal to or more negative than minus 20%. This is not what I had expected and there is a lesson there in terms of judging the question based on historical evidence rather than gut feel! Now there are obviously various caveats that suggest that all things are NOT equal. Specifically, capital markets are more liquid, transparent etc, etc, while the composition of assets has also seen a structural change towards non-tangible assets. This means that traditionally reported earnings may mean less that previously (Amazon rarely reports a profit, yet it is not a top ten company by market cap globally).

Case in point being the recent run-up that began after Trump's election, even though most economists forecasted a drop of ~10%.  Whether you like Trump (and his policies) or not, it is indisputable that his election introduced increased volatility when compared to Clinton's status quo, which should have been reflected in lower equity values, at least until everyone figured out just what it is that he was going to do.

The Issue  My interest in this area stems from the frequent use of sigma notation by commenters when the market experiences big swings.  For example, there was a multi-day10 sigma increase in the value of the VIX index associated with the August 2015 correction and an 8 sigma single day downswing a couple of weeks later. Once you get past +-4 sigma moves it\u2019s hard to visualize how vast the differences are between the S&P 500 actual returns and the predictions of the normal distribution. The vertical dotted black line on the right side of the chart illustrates the problem.  In the last 67 years, the S&P has had two days with returns between +5.5% and +5.6%.  The normal distribution estimates the probability of one event of that magnitude as 0.0001 in 67 years (where the dotted black line touches the red line) \u2014in other words, we should expect a move near +5.5% once in 67,000 years on average\u2014and in reality, we\u2019ve had two of them in 67 years! From a risk analysis standpoint, this is analogous to building your house above the 67,000-year flood line and being flooded out twice in the last 67 years. This adjusted Laplace distribution closely matches the S&P 500 historical data in predicting that every year there\u2019s around a 75% chance of having a 5 sigma or higher event\u2014a far cry from the normal distribution\u2019s prediction of once per 6900 years.\nhttps://sixfigureinvesting.com/2016/03/modeling-stock-market-returns-with-laplace-distribution-instead-of-normal/"], [1430, "2017-03-29T06:24:47Z", [0.05], ""], [34475, "2017-03-29T02:50:12Z", [0.05], "Since 1951 there have been 1159 days out of 16,663 days when the S&P 500 has traded 20% below the preceding ~365 days (I used 251 trading days to approximate a year).

Three things to note:  (1) what is now the S&P 500 did not start tracking 500 stocks until 1957 and the stocks tracked have changed over time; (2) periods when the S&P 500 closes 20% below the 365 day max roughly correlate to accepted recessions, but this measure is often late to call the recession or shows a 20% drop when there was no accepted recession; and (3)  my estimate is only relevant for the last day of 2017 given the wording of the problem and since our 2017 high (so far) was March 1st, my 6.96% estimate is too high as there are not 251 trading days left in the year. Of course, these 1159 days are clustered, so the question becomes are we close to the start of a new cluster. Since some of these pullbacks have been associated with recessions, it may be appropriate to ask if we have any factors that would predict a recession. (I don\u2019t have an answer to this, but would love to see some good evidence for or against a possible recession). As a side note, here\u2019s a similar analysis of the S&P 500:  from 1983 to 2012 \u201c18% of quarters have a price at least 20% below the 4 quarter trailing high (average 0.73 times per year)\u201d\n (http://qvmgroup.com/invest/2013/03/19/how-often-does-sp-500-have-10-and-20-negative-price-moves/).  Another consideration is that the market is simply over valued and might see a correction (some of those clusters were not associated with recessions), but by how much? We have seen a pretty clear \u201cTrump Narrative\u201d after the election, but there is some argument to be made that this \u201cTrump narrative\u201d of growth and lower taxes broke down last week and that we now await a new narrative (https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-comes-after-the-trump-trade-for-markets-1490285715). This Trump trade has only yielded about 12% and really a little bit less because there was a little downturn right before the election.  Is the market over valued? Probably. Several people have already linked to some nice breakdowns of this topic, but it is important to remember that accounting standard have changed so one must be careful in interpreting historical data (even my own) (http://www.arcap.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/CapeShiller.pdf). The question becomes:  Will the S&P 500 go down12% (the Trump Trade), plus the extra 8% needed to reach 20% before the end of 2017? For now I\u2019ll say about 5%. We will undoubtedly have another correction; I just don\u2019t think it will happen in 2017 without a nearly black swan level event.\n"], [34595, "2017-03-29T01:59:17Z", [0.25], ""], [34377, "2017-03-29T01:09:46Z", [0.14], "Adjusting since we are 1/4 of the way through 2017"], [368, "2017-03-29T00:39:57Z", [0.05], ""], [33818, "2017-03-28T20:23:36Z", [0.13], "There is a 13% historical likelihood of the S&P 500 moving down 18.44% within a span of 278 calendar days.

As it is, you have to also make a judgment about where/when a peak might occur, rather than anchoring to the most recent peak. Be that as it may...  Running historical data (daily closing price levels from Jan 1950 through Dec 2016), I get 10 years where S&P 500 fell 20% or more from its intra-calendar-year high: 1957, 1962, 1966, 1970, 1973, 1974, 1987, 2001, 2002 and 2008 (near misses in 1990 and 2011 of -19.9% and -19.4%, respectively). Frequency is 15%, 20% if we include the two near misses.  For what it's worth, these episodes were far more frequent from 1960s to mid-1970s, rare in the 1980s and 90s, and more common again in the 2000s. If you include the near misses, the only period where such intrayear declines were truly rare was the mid-1980s.  Counting only declines of 20% or more, the average occurence was 1.67 out of every rolling 10-year period. We're currently at 1 in the past 10 years (2008). Not sure this provides much information. Including 1990 and 2011, this figure becomes 2.12 and we're currently at 2 (2008, 2011). According to this measure, we're historically in line (slightly below) until the end of 2017. Not a lot of information in that, but could pull the probability for this year *very slightly* lower.  Re economic data, most senitment indicators are surprising to the upside, and there appears to be a synchronized global recovery taking hold. Labor markets have shown improvement in some important areas, although Fed's labor market conditions index has been soft, and labor tends to be a late-cycle indicator. Neutral on the economic outlook and its potential impact, although slightly biased to the upside. It might be helpful to compare various economic indicators to historic S&P500 price data.  I still view Fed hikes, FBI's ongoing investigation into Russian influence, and House GOP's fervent belief that federal government spending is revenue constrained as meaningful risk factors to US equities. Based on its March statement, I think the Fed is unlikely to derail equity markets this calendar year. On the second one, even in a most chaotic outcome (e.g., resignations and/or impeachments within the executive branch), it seems entirely out of the question that 2016 election results would be overturned. Thus, GOP should maintain control of executive and both houses of Congress. (Of course, such an outcome could delay tax and regulatory changes that markets seem to be discounitng.) The third risk is the greater of the three, imo. In the near term, it is likely to mean spending increases and/or tax cuts with lower fiscal multipliers than spending that's being decreased and/or tax rates that are likely to increase. This remains to be seen, of course. Longer term (and probably less significant to the timeframe of this challenge question), a concerted pursuit of balanced federal budgets would (eventually) have negative consequences for risky assets like equities.  Also fair to say that US large-cap equities are fairly valued if not somewhat overvalued. It would help to have valuation data to compare to S&P500 price data. Without it, I'm not prepared to take too strong of a stand on the valuation angle.

There is certainly potential for an \"unusual circumstance\" to develop during the year, but baring such an occurrence, the current direction of the economy is generally positive, and a 20% drawdown rate appears high.   The current value of the S&P 500 is 2,382, and at this level a probability of 15% seems more reasonable.  This probability would be re-evaluated if the market goes up significantly from here or if an \u201cunusual circumstance\u201d occurs.\n"], [30652, "2017-03-03T04:50:29Z", [0.02], ""], [23861, "2017-03-03T03:51:02Z", [0.15], ""], [20949, "2017-03-03T01:40:52Z", [0.1], "US Tax policies to favor Business.

On top of that, I would list possible downsize risks and evaluate their probability. 1) Bankruptcy of a systemically important institution (Deutsche Bank, a major UK bank struggling with Brexit, a major Italian bank struggling with NPLs). Good study on systemic importance here https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2012/wp12282.pdf. Extremely unlikely, although a bailout could still rock markets. 2) Deterioration of the trading relationship between the US and China. Possible, but unlikely in a sudden way that would trigger market stress. 3) Political risks in Europe. Unlikely and in addition limited impact on US markets (Brexit caused a 6% fall in the S&P) Even a Le Pen presidency and/or Cinque Sterre coming to power in Italy, would probably not cause this. 4) Sudden revaluation of a key asset class (such as CMBSs). Unlikely 5) A flash crash or other extreme price swing due to automated trading. Unlikely and by definition the recovery is immediate and not reflected in the end-of-day closing level. IF one of these risks triggered, the effects would be exacerbated by current regulation affecting market functioning. The excessive metrics of the capital ratio, leverage ratio, LCR and NSFR, though conceived as safe guards against future crises, have rendered banks incapable of performing many of their basic intermediation tasks, including taking on board risk that other parties (institutional investors) cannot take on. This is mainly affecting the fixed income markets, but in case a stress scenario is triggered, for whatever reason, it will inevitably spill over into equity markets as well. With liquidity drying up due to banks inability to participate in the markets, other entities will have to engage in fire sales to make a flight to safety out of equities, into treasuries or gold for instance, which will cause stock prices to plunge. The Trump administration is planning amendments to Dodd-Frank, but the details are unknown at this stage. If done in a sensible way that restores banks as fully functioning intermediaries and transferors of risk, the above risk is mitigated. The FED has also proved in the past that it is very much proactive in handling market stress situations and would likely quickly step in to calm markets.

Will it happen?  I don't know.  I do think Janet Yellen will want to raise rates enough to control inflation.  How much I don't know.  Too much FED rate hike and you could get a 20% selloff this year.  Yellen is gone in 2018.  Another thought, what would be a catalyst to get a huge (3 trillion) rebuild America infrastructure bill passed with urgency?  A bear market (>20% selloff) ?

Given the average standard deviation of stock price returns, I estimate the probability of a 20% downside move to be roughly 15%.  Since World War II, there have been 15 bear markets in the S&P 500.  That's about 21% of the years.  Taken together, this evidence indicates an \"outside view\" of a 15% to 26% likelihood of a 20% decline; call it 20%.   There are several reasons why I think 2017 has a lower than average risk of a bear market. First, the economy is reasonably strong.  Second, there is a good probability of a fiscal stimulus in the form of infrastructure spending.  Third, profit growth is accelerating.  I think this adds up to less than half the usual odds of a bear market, or a roughly 1 in 10 chance.   The main risk to my forecast is a Fed that raises rates too quickly.
