I'd suspect Thomas, but his vote in Reynolds suggests the opposite. This feels to me similar to Oil States from last year; a surprising splitless separation-of-powers cert grant where the biggest question after the decision comes out winds up being \"who in the world were the four to grant cert\"? Gorsuch is lock R, Alito lock A.  Kagan and Breyer are solid A.  I'd say Sotomayor leans A, and the rest are toss-ups, all fairly independently so.  That means R depends on every toss-up going that way, plus a lean.  The splitless grant gives me pause, but it's very hard to count to 5 for R here, so I'll go with 10%.  Might change if it takes a while to decide."], [691, "2018-10-03T13:13:22Z", [0.18], ""], [1333, "2018-10-02T11:56:12Z", [0.45], "The nondelegation doctrine makes its return to the U.S. Supreme Court this term with Gundy v. United States, scheduled to be argued on October 2, 2018. The case involves whether the Constitution allows Congress to empower the U.S. attorney general to apply the Sex Offender Notification and Registration Act (SORNA) retroactively (as was done to defendant Herman Gundy) without providing guidance about how to use that power. Not since 1935 has the Court ruled that a congressional action was unconstitutional on nondelegation grounds. Pacific Legal Foundation attorney Mark Miller wrote in The Hill that \u2018\u2019our Founding Fathers delegated the lawmaking authority to Congress, and then made legislators responsible to the people by allowing the people to vote them in or out of office every two years, according to how Congress abused or properly used its lawmaking power. Congress insulates itself from this accountability by shirking its lawmaking responsibility and handing it off to bureaucrats. The Supreme Court should use the Gundy case to put a stop to this purposeful avoidance of accountability.\u201d Courts writer for Slate Mark Joseph Stern said many \u201cprogressives fear that, once resuscitated, the [nondelegation doctrine] could be used to strike down all manner of economic regulations [...] These days, Congress hands off most regulatory authority to a slew of federal agencies situated in the executive branch. A court concerned about nondelegation could strike down a vast range of liberal legislation under the doctrine. Labor laws and environmental protections would be especially vulnerable, since Congress gives agencies a broad mandate to interpret and implement these measures. If the Supreme Court renders that mandate unconstitutional, federal rules that protect workers\u2019 rights, collective bargaining, clean air, and endangered species would fall.\u201d The Cato Institute argued in its amicus brief that, \u201cThe Vesting Clauses in the Constitution\u2019s first three articles establish a tripartite government of divided authority. While these may overlap at the margins, each branch retains a core set of powers such that it may check and balance the others. To permit delegation from one to another\u2014for purported efficiency gains\u2014undermines that original design. After all, why should Congress deliberate, make judgments, and stand accountable for each determination when it can license the executive to apply purportedly greater wisdom or technocratic expertise?\u201d"], [691, "2018-10-01T11:38:39Z", [0.17], ""], [35831, "2018-10-01T04:31:43Z", [0.6], "Before hearing oral argument, I think a Yes would be supported by the originalists and one of them is about to be confirmed."], [1333, "2018-09-29T14:29:35Z", [0.56], ""], [61242, "2018-09-28T22:19:13Z", [0.77], ""], [12573, "2018-09-28T15:14:16Z", [0.03], "The Court should rule that it does violate that it is an unlawful delegation, but they won't."], [1333, "2018-09-27T17:05:25Z", [0.55], ""], [19022, "2018-09-26T07:54:28Z", [0.0], "Year almost over court dudes are old and the wax of the ear is in the system "], [43588, "2018-09-25T16:56:43Z", [0.5], ""], [1333, "2018-09-24T20:31:05Z", [0.47], ""], [53555, "2018-09-24T18:12:07Z", [0.85], ""], [57998, "2018-09-24T16:31:38Z", [0.25], ""], [691, "2018-09-24T12:01:33Z", [0.15], ""], [32300, "2018-09-24T11:12:26Z", [0.29], ""], [1333, "2018-09-23T19:30:11Z", [0.48], ""], [1019, "2018-09-23T13:15:33Z", [0.15], ""], [34725, "2018-09-23T12:17:42Z", [0.1], "Would be an interesting precedent.
