The higher-than-expected compliance with the deal has been a major factor behind the upswing in prices, analysts say. OPEC\u2019s compliance in the first three quarters of 2017 was close to 90%, J.P. Morgan analysts estimate, adding that Saudi Arabia was \u201cclearly doing whatever it takes to balance the markets\u201d with a cut that was 20% above their required target (para. 6). A slowdown in the pace of growth of U.S. shale output has supported prices in recent months. The number of rigs currently drilling for oil in the U.S., typically viewed as a proxy for activity in the sector, dropped from a peak of 768 earlier this year to 737 last week (para. 9). \u201cIt is not a significant reduction and its impact will not be felt for 5-6 months but nevertheless it shows that U.S. shale oil production might not grow as much next year as currently estimated,\u201d said Tamas Varga, analyst at brokerage PVM (para. 9-10). \u201cWe believe that [oil prices] are overheated and expect them to correct in the short term,\u201d the bank said (para. 13). Further out, the banks in the survey predict that Brent will average $58 a barrel in 2019. While up slightly from the previous survey, that forecast is still down from the $72 a barrel in the October survey last year (para. 13-14). Kantchev, G. (2017).

Global benchmark Brent crude LCOc1 closed up 13 cents or 0.2 percent to $57.54 a barrel, notching up a third-quarter gain of around 20 percent. On the week, Brent was up 1.2 percent. The contract reached its highest in more than two years earlier in the week, resulting in a fifth consecutive weekly gain. This was Brent\u2019s longest weekly bull run since June 2016. U.S. crude CLc1 closed up 11 cents to settle at $51.67 a barrel, its strongest third quarter in 10 years and longest streak of weekly gains since January. U.S. crude was up around 2 percent on the week. \u201cThe bigger concern for oil is the Kurdish region,\u201d said Matt Smith, director of Commodity Research at ClipperData. \u201cToday we\u2019re seeing international flights banned, the trucking of fuels being banned from Iran.\u201d Iraq\u2019s Kurds endorsed secession by nine to one in a referendum on Monday that has angered Turkey, the central government in Baghdad and other powers, which fear the vote could lead to renewed conflict in the oil-rich region (para 1-6).

The new \u201cconstituent assembly,\u201d put together to rewrite the constitution, is seen by most as an attempt to erode the nation\u2019s democracy and consolidate power in the hands of the president (para. 1-2) \nBut even if Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro manages to maintain power and push through a new constitution that defangs any restraints on his grip, he won\u2019t be able to outrun the spiraling economic crisis. Perhaps the most visible economic issue is the debt payments that fall due this year. Venezuela has $5 billion in debt maturing before the year is out \u2013 both in sovereign bonds and in debt payments by state-owned oil company PDVSA (para. 4). \nThat is an alarming figure given that the government has an estimated $3 billion in cash reserves, according to S&P Global Ratings, a paltry sum that means a default in the next few months is more likely than not. Venezuela has to pay $725 million in debt payments this month, although the problem gets really serious in October and November, when a combined $3.6 billion in debt must be paid to bondholders. The value of PDVSA\u2019s bonds has plunged in recent weeks (para. 4-6).

On the whole, we are almost net-neutral in terms of crude oil import-export. However, shale oil production is slated to increase through 2019, despite the low cost per barrel. First, 40% of US drillers is now funding by private investors, decreasing the pressure to turn an early profit. Second, many producers have locked-in contracts to guarantee prices, despite increases in production. Third, due to increased efficiencies, 60% of US shale drills are now profitable within a range of $35-55/bl. As more drills come on line through 2017 and into 2018, the US will be better poised to increase production in the event of additional OPEC cuts, taking market share. This production will exert downward pressure on the price of Brent crude. Thus, the real question is whether the price will be over or under $50 by the end of year. Right now, I believe it is 40/60% since most US wells will break even or be slightly profitable there. I do not think there is a realistic chance for it to fall below $40.

If the market moves into deficit later this year and demand increases in China then it is possible oil prices could be pushed up in December.  \u201cBecause of a lag between the deployment of drilling rigs and realised oil production, recent rig increases indicated that US oil production will likely rise further in the coming months.\u201d (EIA STEO -  https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/pdf/steo_full.pdf) \nWith Summer approaching, the rising US oil production should be partially offset by seasonal demand, but given the amount US production has increased since November 2016, it\u2019s possible oil prices could drop due to over supply (https://www.ft.com/content/5fba6a88-34f8-11e7-99bd-13beb0903fa3) - \u201cUS crude oil production is expected to average 9.3mb/d\u201d (https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/pdf/steo_full.pdf) \n"], [35504, "2017-05-12T20:10:11Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0], ""], [22689, "2017-05-12T18:15:50Z", [0.0, 0.7, 0.3, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [368, "2017-05-12T18:10:19Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [35480, "2017-05-12T16:11:15Z", [0.05, 0.45, 0.45, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [35481, "2017-05-12T15:24:33Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.75, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [34108, "2017-05-12T15:24:08Z", [0.15, 0.71, 0.1, 0.03, 0.01], ""], [35302, "2017-05-12T14:26:29Z", [0.25, 0.38, 0.25, 0.09, 0.03], ""], [21884, "2017-05-12T06:52:30Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.45, 0.4, 0.1], ""], [14253, "2017-05-12T06:38:21Z", [0.09, 0.43, 0.42, 0.05, 0.01], ""], [35416, "2017-05-12T03:08:06Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.3, 0.3, 0.4], ""], [34589, "2017-05-11T22:15:50Z", [0.11, 0.4, 0.4, 0.08, 0.01], ""], [33818, "2017-05-11T21:11:49Z", [0.14, 0.27, 0.29, 0.17, 0.13], ""], [14253, "2017-05-11T18:13:50Z", [0.07, 0.42, 0.44, 0.06, 0.01], ""], [14253, "2017-05-11T18:04:06Z", [0.06, 0.41, 0.46, 0.06, 0.01], ""], [368, "2017-05-11T17:50:54Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [16652, "2017-05-11T07:27:20Z", [0.01, 0.26, 0.56, 0.16, 0.01], ""], [29680, "2017-05-11T06:56:21Z", [0.01, 0.4, 0.5, 0.08, 0.01], ""], [33818, "2017-05-10T21:56:30Z", [0.15, 0.27, 0.29, 0.17, 0.12], ""], [368, "2017-05-10T18:37:26Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2017-05-10T14:17:11Z", [0.0, 0.42, 0.57, 0.01, 0.0], ""], [22833, "2017-05-10T13:39:36Z", [0.0, 0.8, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [16652, "2017-05-10T09:05:42Z", [0.01, 0.31, 0.66, 0.01, 0.01], ""], [14847, "2017-05-10T02:57:49Z", [0.01, 0.5, 0.48, 0.01, 0.0], ""], [33818, "2017-05-09T20:06:31Z", [0.17, 0.31, 0.26, 0.16, 0.1], ""], [368, "2017-05-09T18:07:54Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [212, "2017-05-09T16:56:55Z", [0.02, 0.36, 0.58, 0.04, 0.0], ""], [691, "2017-05-09T16:31:52Z", [0.0, 0.43, 0.57, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [14027, "2017-05-09T15:57:27Z", [0.12, 0.53, 0.31, 0.03, 0.01], ""], [34628, "2017-05-09T14:59:09Z", [0.09, 0.34, 0.4, 0.15, 0.02], ""], [33818, "2017-05-08T20:10:48Z", [0.16, 0.3, 0.27, 0.16, 0.11], ""], [368, "2017-05-08T19:55:08Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [49, "2017-05-08T18:44:33Z", [0.25, 0.35, 0.25, 0.1, 0.05], ""], [14847, "2017-05-08T17:30:11Z", [0.01, 0.48, 0.5, 0.01, 0.0], ""], [14847, "2017-05-08T17:29:18Z", [0.01, 0.46, 0.5, 0.02, 0.01], ""], [14847, "2017-05-08T17:28:05Z", [0.01, 0.41, 0.55, 0.02, 0.01], ""], [691, "2017-05-08T11:22:08Z", [0.0, 0.43, 0.57, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [14847, "2017-05-08T04:52:42Z", [0.01, 0.38, 0.55, 0.05, 0.01], ""], [368, "2017-05-07T19:16:07Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [4634, "2017-05-07T16:15:46Z", [0.15, 0.4, 0.38, 0.05, 0.02], ""], [34649, "2017-05-07T15:17:15Z", [0.0, 0.25, 0.45, 0.2, 0.1], "I adjusted down the price levels as OPEC production cuts are being offset by US producers."], [19846, "2017-05-07T15:06:47Z", [0.1, 0.4, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2017-05-07T12:13:26Z", [0.0, 0.43, 0.57, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [35302, "2017-05-07T09:03:18Z", [0.3, 0.45, 0.2, 0.04, 0.01], ""], [368, "2017-05-06T20:58:47Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [4139, "2017-05-06T18:22:51Z", [0.0, 0.7, 0.3, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [35244, "2017-05-06T15:23:36Z", [0.0, 0.21, 0.6, 0.19, 0.0], ""], [691, "2017-05-06T13:04:08Z", [0.0, 0.43, 0.57, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [29648, "2017-05-06T08:29:38Z", [0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.25, 0.05], ""], [31756, "2017-05-06T06:16:36Z", [0.02, 0.45, 0.45, 0.06, 0.02], ""], [33818, "2017-05-05T21:59:36Z", [0.17, 0.3, 0.27, 0.16, 0.1], ""], [3363, "2017-05-05T20:58:10Z", [0.1, 0.25, 0.38, 0.19, 0.08], ""], [15621, "2017-05-05T20:55:47Z", [0.0, 0.36, 0.55, 0.08, 0.01], "Currently 49.50"], [691, "2017-05-05T18:45:58Z", [0.0, 0.43, 0.57, 0.0, 0.0], "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-markets-idUSKBN181022\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil-idUSKBN18000F\nThe Goode Olde Days for oil are probably over, but it is not yet clear whether the Next Thing is steady decline or unconstrained volatility.

I read that \"politics trumps economics\" over at the Epsilon Theory website (http://www.epsilontheory.com ).  That suggests a tendency for sideways movement in demand rather than a clear uptrend.

Furthermore, if there is one thing I can count on in oil markets, its that OPEC members will cheat on their production commitments and thus keep prices stable, if not send them lower over the course of the year. http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/energy/crude-oil/brent-crude-oil-last-day.html"], [4634, "2017-03-31T05:59:59Z", [0.1, 0.32, 0.48, 0.08, 0.02], ""], [33792, "2017-03-31T00:17:23Z", [0.1, 0.4, 0.4, 0.08, 0.02], ""], [33818, "2017-03-30T21:23:24Z", [0.14, 0.21, 0.27, 0.2, 0.18], ""], [4577, "2017-03-30T20:54:55Z", [0.17, 0.16, 0.22, 0.2, 0.25], ""], [26242, "2017-03-30T19:16:19Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.85, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [4634, "2017-03-30T18:06:57Z", [0.1, 0.35, 0.45, 0.08, 0.02], ""], [34589, "2017-03-30T17:33:46Z", [0.15, 0.45, 0.3, 0.09, 0.01], ""], [691, "2017-03-30T15:35:57Z", [0.0, 0.49, 0.51, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [13377, "2017-03-29T22:34:32Z", [0.0, 0.25, 0.7, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [33818, "2017-03-29T20:17:03Z", [0.14, 0.22, 0.27, 0.2, 0.17], ""], [31369, "2017-03-29T15:40:26Z", [0.05, 0.4, 0.5, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [14237, "2017-03-29T15:10:29Z", [0.02, 0.1, 0.66, 0.14, 0.08], ""], [368, "2017-03-29T00:38:58Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [34589, "2017-03-28T21:29:30Z", [0.15, 0.45, 0.3, 0.08, 0.02], ""], [33818, "2017-03-28T20:19:52Z", [0.16, 0.23, 0.27, 0.19, 0.15], ""], [691, "2017-03-28T18:45:46Z", [0.0, 0.49, 0.51, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [23355, "2017-03-28T10:10:59Z", [0.0, 0.9, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [34570, "2017-03-28T03:18:08Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.15, 0.45, 0.35], "War in Middle East, low investment in the last 2 years"], [28091, "2017-03-28T01:23:17Z", [0.0, 0.32, 0.68, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [368, "2017-03-28T00:49:25Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [34568, "2017-03-27T22:53:01Z", [0.55, 0.4, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [14847, "2017-03-27T16:12:26Z", [0.03, 0.3, 0.48, 0.15, 0.04], ""], [691, "2017-03-27T15:54:42Z", [0.0, 0.49, 0.51, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [368, "2017-03-26T19:43:30Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [23409, "2017-03-26T17:14:02Z", [0.12, 0.29, 0.35, 0.21, 0.03], ""], [14027, "2017-03-26T16:57:35Z", [0.13, 0.49, 0.32, 0.05, 0.01], ""], [691, "2017-03-26T15:20:20Z", [0.0, 0.49, 0.51, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [34349, "2017-03-26T14:56:47Z", [0.05, 0.5, 0.33, 0.12, 0.0], ""], [14253, "2017-03-26T14:16:21Z", [0.11, 0.45, 0.39, 0.04, 0.01], ""], [30485, "2017-03-26T14:05:43Z", [0.0, 0.35, 0.6, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [15196, "2017-03-26T04:24:52Z", [0.0, 0.8, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [23861, "2017-03-26T02:58:43Z", [0.01, 0.1, 0.8, 0.06, 0.03], ""], [31756, "2017-03-25T20:50:19Z", [0.18, 0.3, 0.35, 0.14, 0.03], ""], [368, "2017-03-25T20:21:53Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2017-03-25T19:10:02Z", [0.0, 0.49, 0.51, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [29054, "2017-03-25T17:49:19Z", [0.0, 0.26, 0.74, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [2961, "2017-03-25T16:09:23Z", [0.1, 0.5, 0.2, 0.15, 0.05], ""], [24155, "2017-03-25T14:14:06Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.8, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [691, "2017-03-24T20:32:44Z", [0.0, 0.49, 0.51, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [368, "2017-03-24T17:59:49Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [34108, "2017-03-24T16:35:02Z", [0.25, 0.55, 0.15, 0.04, 0.01], ""], [28414, "2017-03-24T13:55:50Z", [0.0, 0.25, 0.7, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [34051, "2017-03-24T02:47:49Z", [0.0, 0.5, 0.35, 0.15, 0.0], "Total US rig count still on upward trend / Permain basin rigs rising sharply;

Nearly half of those rigs are located in the Permian Basin alone, which has almost tripled its rig count over the past year, according Baker Hughes\u201d (http://money.cnn.com/2017/03/20/investing/permian-basin-oil-texas-shale-opec/) The article from CNN also states \u201cBy comparison, production is shrinking in the Eagle Ford and Bakken\u201d. The data provided by the EIA shows the oil production in the Permian Region is up 79tb/d in March (https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/drilling/pdf/permian.pdf), contrary to the CNN article, production in Eagle Ford is up 28tb/d. (https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/drilling/pdf/eagleford.pdf)  However, Bakken oil production is down 10tb/d (March 2017), which, if it continues to decline, will partially offset the rise in production from the other regions. (https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/drilling/pdf/bakken.pdf). This is not enough to increase prices to the level OPEC was hoping for but it will help in the grand scheme of things.  It is possible the US drillers will realise its not sustainable to be drilling at the current rate. \u201cIf oil prices stay this low, it will be hard to justify the Permian\u2019s sky-high land prices. Plus oil producers there are already complaining about rising prices for services\u201d (http://money.cnn.com/2017/03/20/investing/permian-basin-oil-texas-shale-opec/)  There is also talk about OPEC extending the deal. \u201cOil prices edges higher on Tuesday, helped by expectations that OPEC-led output cuts would be extended beyond June, though gains were capped by persistently high crude inventories.\u201d (http://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil-idUSKBN16S040).

However, it appears that in an attempt to save the purpose of the output cut OPEC are starting discussions with US producers.

But while the shale producers signalled they weren't ready to give up on the growth they see ahead, OPEC indicated it wants higher prices, even if it means enriching the shale companies\u201d (www.bloomberg.com).

If price pressures continue over the next 2 month, there is a chance the agreement may not be renewed and individual countries may increase production, further driving down prices.

According to an article from Reuters: \u201cOPEC could extend the pact or apply deeper cuts from July if global crude inventories fail to drop enough\u201d (http://uk.reuters.com/article/global-oil-idUKL4N1G507S). I\u2019m sure it will become clear, eventually, what OPEC is justifying as \u201cenough\u201d, but some sort of transition phase would be needed in order to keep oil prices relatively stable, otherwise going from having production cuts to no cuts in June would cause a surge of oil into the market leading to the building of inventories again.  Crude oil prices are also dependent on the future of US output and the potential impact it could have on offsetting the OPEC deal, hence leading to a drop in oil prices: \u201cOil prices rose on Monday, but gains were minimal as investors gauged whether an increase in US drilling and record stockpiles would undermine efforts by producers to cut output and bring the market into balance\u201d (http://uk.reuters.com/article/global-oil-idUKL4N1G507S).  Also need to take into consideration the general trend of supply and demand. The spot price of Brent crude will be affected during the third quarter: \u201cIt [3Q] is when most North sea producers undertake maintenance, which cuts the output of Brent and other grades during the summer.\u201d (http://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-opec-kemp-idUSKBN15T2BV). As long as demand is still there, decreasing supply would increase the spot price for Brent crude, however, this would then lead to a decrease in oil price in the 4Q as oil fields come back online and production increases again. \n"], [32789, "2017-02-26T22:32:00Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.2, 0.7, 0.05], ""], [12983, "2017-02-26T21:55:19Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.75, 0.0], ""], [19144, "2017-02-26T21:47:41Z", [0.03, 0.22, 0.38, 0.28, 0.09], ""], [11785, "2017-02-26T21:42:33Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.8, 0.05, 0.0], "Good chance Iran will be pushed out, but I think production will grow in Iraq.
