Here's one more example of the happening: The headline is, \"Syria\u2019s Assad authorizes Iraqi forces to strike IS in Syria\" https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/syrias-assad-authorizes-iraqi-forces-to-strike-is-in-syria/2018/12/30/10da7ec6-0c42-11e9-8f0c-6f878a26288a_story.html?utm_term=.3210218cf3e6 So apparently, Assad does not think that Iraqi forces temporarily operating within Syria will in any way compromise his position. And of course he's right. The Iraqis don't think there's any odium associated with an alliance of convenience with Assad. The U.S. withdrawal just means that the Kurds are now making an explicit accommodation with the regime. The Kurds and the regime have been passively cooperating all along - recall the Kurdish enclave in Aleppo, which remained unmolested while the rest of the city was pulverized by Assad. In the past few days, the Turks were trying to push their Syrian puppet militia through to Manbij. Then the Kurds invited to regime to occupy the city. Expect that to happen in the rest of the Kurdish areas. Now we'll see if the next phase is the regime, backed by Russia, winds up fighting against the Syrian rebels stiffened by a militia backed by Turkey. According to the story linked below, the Turks have 15,000 Syrian soldiers on their payroll. Not very many, but it does appear to be an actual army, and the Turks control territory contiguous with the last rebel enclave centered on Idlib, so supply shouldn't be much of a problem. Air power is a different story, but it looks like the Turks are committed, so I assume they have something in mind to take care of that. https://www.nbcnews.com/news/mideast/turkey-backed-syrian-fighters-prepare-replace-u-s-forces-n951566 Anyway, we'll see if the war continues in earnest, in a new phase, or sputters out.

The Syrian government celebrated the reopening on Monday of a vital border crossing with Jordan as a new sign of President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s reestablished control over much of the country and of progress in his efforts to normalize relations with other Arab states. The civil war that has torn apart Syria since 2011 has ravaged the country\u2019s economy and severed many of its regional relationships, and Mr. Assad, along with his Russian and Iranian allies, is now hoping that he can undo the damage. The Nasib border crossing, along Syria\u2019s southern border with Jordan, was closed for three years because the territory on the Syrian side was controlled by mix of armed rebels and jihadist fighters. The Syrian government seized the area this summer with the help of Russian airstrikes, allowing the crossing to reopen. The Nasib crossing is a vital economic artery for the two countries, and its opening allows Syria to export produce and other goods to Jordan and send it on to other Arab countries.\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/world/middleeast/syria-jordan-assad-trade.html Reopening the border will support the Assad regime financially, especially after Israel recently reopened the Quneitra crossing in the occupied Golan Heights. This was also seen as a diplomatic victory for Assad, who has been largely isolated in the region since the start of the country\u2019s civil war, which has killed hundreds of thousands of people.\nhttps://www.middleeasteye.net/columns/reopening-syria-jordan-border-crossing-reflects-improving-relations-1961921853"], [1056, "2018-11-06T01:51:43Z", [0.0], ""], [62081, "2018-11-05T20:25:39Z", [0.1], ""], [368, "2018-11-05T19:27:27Z", [0.0], ""], [56294, "2018-11-05T15:08:10Z", [0.05], ""], [27978, "2018-11-05T14:00:33Z", [0.0], ""], [30097, "2018-11-04T22:22:33Z", [0.05], ""], [62047, "2018-11-04T21:47:00Z", [0.01], ""], [2965, "2018-11-04T12:45:37Z", [0.0], ""], [14847, "2018-11-04T05:14:25Z", [0.01], "The status quo seems to favor him hanging on and he has backing from a couple countries.

Lastly, when there is retaliation, it is against the use of \"chemical weapons\" or other similar things, not Assad, making Assad more confident in his position and unconcerned; \"Given that the Western strikes in Syria were about chemical weapons and nothing more, it is no surprise that Syria's President Assad was reported to be in a good mood...Assad now has further reason to feel confident that the United States will not work to topple his regime.\" The reason I have not said there is a 0% chance is because there could be a chance of his death or assassination. But, generally the probability of Assad staying in power for another three months is very high as there have been no strong signs showing no willingness to remove him. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/05/30/the-world-learns-to-live-with-assad-in-syria/?utm_term=.63db6ec9240c\nhttps://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2018/04/16/602831396/why-no-world-power-really-wants-to-topple-syrias-assad\nhttps://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/column-removing-syrias-assad-power-complicated\nhttps://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/04/bashar-al-assad-power-180414061304833.html\nhttps://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/johnson-britain-may-accept-assad-staying-in-power-6t7mqkdkm"], [61564, "2018-10-15T18:45:26Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2018-10-15T18:38:02Z", [0.0], ""], [2965, "2018-10-15T14:49:15Z", [0.0], ""], [61100, "2018-10-15T12:37:19Z", [0.25], ""], [2965, "2018-10-15T07:49:12Z", [0.0], ""], [4681, "2018-10-15T03:51:23Z", [0.06], ""], [60728, "2018-10-15T01:18:04Z", [0.1], ""], [61551, "2018-10-15T01:15:04Z", [0.0], ""], [44069, "2018-10-14T20:55:13Z", [0.05], "Short of death/ assassination I expect him to pe be president of Syria in January 2019.\n"], [50825, "2018-10-14T20:43:06Z", [0.15], ""], [368, "2018-10-14T20:32:15Z", [0.0], ""], [3316, "2018-10-14T20:06:13Z", [0.0], ""], [61539, "2018-10-14T19:45:45Z", [0.05], "There are no viable candidates to replace him"], [61536, "2018-10-14T18:58:45Z", [0.0], "Putin needs him"], [61537, "2018-10-14T18:50:07Z", [0.25], "Depends on complaints in Russia rising regarding economy, maybe his wife\u2019s health, Iran wants him there so chances for him stepping down are slim"], [1333, "2018-10-14T18:19:17Z", [0.0], ""], [3152, "2018-10-14T17:53:49Z", [0.75], ""], [61529, "2018-10-14T17:13:39Z", [0.05], ""], [61525, "2018-10-14T17:01:25Z", [0.05], "Putin"], [61522, "2018-10-14T16:48:14Z", [0.05], "Anything is possible, but it's very unlikely.

Okay first things first, let\u2019s break this down into parts. And the options seems to be unlikely at best.  What would it take for this to happen?  \nPresident al-Assad could\u2026\nbe politically ousted by politicians\nbe a coupe, either internal or external  Other Political Factors: \nRussia \nThe United Nations\nTurkey How likely is President al-Assad to be politically ousted? \nPresident al-Assad is a member of the Ba\u2019ath Party. In the People\u2019s Council of Syria, the legislative branch of government. The Ba\u2019ath Party holds the large majority of the seats in the People\u2019s Council at 200 seats out of a 250.   Since there have been rumors that the election in 2014 was illegitimate in favor of Al-Assad, I doubt there will be any dissent from his party [1] [2].  Maybe some indicators for a coupe first:\nPrevious Coupe Attempts  \nLarge groups of the population are excluded from the government who is in power [3] \nProtests against the Assad Regime How Likely is a Coupe-Detat actually?\nNot really likely, the last stronghold of the rebellion is in Aleppo and Idlab. The reason there protesting is because they\u2019re expecting an attack [4]. And another thing, let\u2019s say Turkey does attack, he\u2019s going against the Iranian military and the Russian Military. I\u2019ll put the probability at 5%.  What if there are chemical weapons used?\nI don\u2019t think much will come of it. Outside of public statements and tariffs (I\u2019m tired, okay?). However, after that the United States would be involved in some capacity. However, given that Assad has control of the majority of Syria, and there is a one month hiatus from figting. A regime change via a chemical weapon by 2019 is less than 1% likely.

Russia's backing of Assad not only gives the regime strength internally, but also prevents any external powers like the US from attempting some botched procedure to remove him. Particularly with the currently administration, the US wouldn't challenge Russia on something this massive. Additionally, Israel even wants Assad to stay at this point. \n2. The rebel forces are far too fractured and weakened to make any comeback to take Damascus or any major city at this point. (Certainly not by 1 Jan '19)\n3.

Even though the middle eastern history has been filled with war and violence in the recent past, their leaders getting killed while in office was surprising low. There are only three in the past 100 years. Possibilities of assignation si therefore low.  Assad and his team must be well aware of the possibilities and would be extremely cautions at least at present and in the immediate future. The possibility is around 2%. Assad seems to be healthy and is not known to be suffering from any life threating disease hence the possibility of natural death in the immediate future is zero. Third scenario of over throw by his enemies has weaken since the Syrian government forces recent battle gains in the southern part. His regime is openly supported by Russia and Iran which means he will be supported in the war in the near future. In this scenario Assad\u2019s enemy will remain weak. Assad's own forces will fight to the end extremely hard since losing means getting exterminated by  free Syrian army. With the recent successes, present Syrian government forces are in a strong position to continue the battle for a long time. Possibility of this scenario is 2% The last scenario of over throw by his own supports is very unlikely scenario given the nature of the Syrian government under the minority sect.

Assad gets what he wants - a pretty good chance of dying in bed of old age. Russia gets its bases in the eastern Mediterranean - which it wants primarily for prestige purposes anyway. Israel gets guaranteed security on its northern and northwestern border. The U.S. gets rid of an ongoing diplomatic headache. The ordinary citizens of Syria don't make out so well, since they're still stuck with Assad. But except for what I would qualify as a brief blip of a potential possibility seven years ago, they didn't have much hope of anything other than a choice between chaos and tyranny, and probably a combination of both.

Assad is likely to remain the leader in Syria for the forseeable future for several  reasons. One of the most important reasons is the weakening of his opposition and enemies. The Free Syrian Army is no longer as intimidating as it once was at the beginning of the conflict and the opposition in the country has virtually disappeared. If Assad is to be replaced, there needs to be a new figure that not only enjoys broad support, but would even be allowed to run. Assad has taken steps to solidify his power over the years and he has enjoyed support from Russia, Hezbollah, and Iran, which are powerful actions in the region. Russia has become very entangled in the war as well and is determined to keep Assad in power. Due to their influence, it is likely that any negotiations on Syria's future will involve them. If the US and its allies were to intervene in Syria, it is likely this would bring a conflict with Russia, which is not in the interests of the United States. Assad has also made progress on retaining and expanding his territory in Syria and with continued Russian help, his opposition is likely to be defeated. Without US intervention and a viable opposition in Syria, change is unlikely.

It is also unlikely any sudden peace agreement that contains provision of Assad's removal would be accepted at this juncture 2) The most probable scenarios in which Assad is no longer in power by the end of the year involve death or incapacitation by terrorist attack/assassination and death/incapacitation by natural causes. \n-Of the two, the former is less likely due to the myriad security precautions and loyalists surrounding him which no doubt have been stepped up because of the war\n-A reasonable assumption is that Assad's health care quality is on par or better than that of the average citizen of the United States.

What happens if Russia decided to actually retaliate? Which they said that they will against future US and allies strikes. Perhaps even against the one today? Leading to the US being pulled in longer for longer. Even though the Trump explicitly saying that this is a limited strike, Russia may test Trump on this regard. Can Trump deal with the costs of a full scale conflict? I'm not sure whether this would affect Trump's plans for his tariffs. But I'm sure that Russia would be pretty unhappy about the US steel tariffs right now.

I don't know enough about Putin and Russian politics to comment on whether or not this is a viable option for them. Will Trump be able to concede enough?

Doing a quick look at all the other Syrian ministers, and comparing it to the lifespan of a typical American (there are rich people) I place the median at about 75, and I'd say that he would be about 2%-3% chance of dying from health per year. This is just a non-zero number that I feel would be a good starting position for base rate. \n\nIn terms of military coup and revolution, I think that this is pretty unlikely at the moment because they are winning against the rebels. Especially defeating them in Eastern Ghouta. However, the use of chemical attacks against civilians have created animosity against the government, but with ISIS' shadow in the foreground, I don't think this will be too high. As a power vacuum can invite ISIS back. I'd go with 2%-3% here again. Outside interventions is the tricky one here. There are a lot of players, but the Russians seem to be the major ally to Syria. It is unlikely that the Russians will pull out unless Syria gives strong reason for Russia to do so. America have expressed disapproval against Assad and have contemplated removing him, but there seems to be a bit of flip-flopping. Trump and Tillerson (before he was fired) has condemned Syria's use of chemical weapons and have even attacked an air base in April 2017. But their main purpose in Syria was to fight off ISIS, rather than attack Assad. Unless Iran with the help of Lebanon attack Israel, I do not think there is much chance of America doing much more than just keeping an eye on things (as Trump wants to pull his forces out but his generals want to stay mid-term to watch over the area). However, the major influence in this is Russian support, and with possible collusion between the Trump administration and Russia, I don't think that there will be major conflict between the two major powers in Syria. 2%  Assassination from an unknown source is pretty rare but not impossible.

At a minimum this reinforces my view below from a month ago that this opens the door for all off the outside power brokers and proxies to come to some consensus on a rump Syrian Republic general (or figurehead representing generals) to replace Assad to make a long-term resolution easier.  Whatever the end resolution in Syria is, you can be certain it will be hard-eyed and Machiavellian.  Syria now is all about competing and converging national interests.  \"Values\" --- and Russian or Iranian \"loyalty\" to Assad personally -- were killed off long ago.  My previous rationale:  A rational, informed, inside- and outside-based geopolitical analysis would assess that they most important keys to Assad staying or leaving power are: continued support from Russia and Iran (and to a lesser but growing extent China), and lack of a strong, unified opposition to Assad. This would suggest a Yes in the 3%-8% range. But I'm going to venture into Extremistan on this question, and predict that Syria and the region are about to enter a period of even more extreme political, social, economic, and military volatility in coming months, starting now with Turkish attacks, joined by the rump Free Syrian Army, on (US-supported) Kurdish forces in northwest Syria. Given how much it is costing Russia and Iran to prop up Assad (which contributed to recent protests in Iran), and given Erdogan's ongoing calls for Assad to go, I can imagine Turkish military success in Syria in the coming weeks might offer realpolitik deal-makers like Putin, Erdogan, and Khamenei & Soleimani an opportunity to agree on replacing Assad with a more competent and compliant (and Alawite) general.

Second, he can be forcibly removed by outside forces such as the UN and international community. Third, he can be overthrown from forces within the country. Looking at the modern history of Syrian Presidents, most were in office for only 3-4 years until 1971 when Hafez Al-Assad took power and re-structured the government. All but one president before Hafez left office due to an overthrow. However, Hafez served for an unprecedented 29 years before he died in office. Syrian elections are held every 7 years with a fairly high voter turnout (73.4% in 2014) although the votes appear historically very drastically one sided (almost always 90-100 percent and sometimes there are no opponents). Therefore, it is unlikely that Bashar al-Assad will leave his post through legislative means.  While the US has stated that Assad should not remain in power, the UN will not remove him and a vote will not be made to take action against him or remove him because Russia has veto power and supports the Assad regime. Rebels within the country are quickly losing power and influence as Russia fights to support the regime and the US has been slowly pulling out of the region as ISIS is disbanded. Kurdish rebels are still present but Turkey and Iran will not allow them to overthrow the regime. Assad has survived what may be the worst part of the civil war and his backing by Russia makes his forced removal highly unlikely. However, as the Syrian civil war continues to dwindle and restoration projects begin, there is a chance that Assad will not be up to the task of rebuilding the country and will either resign or be forcibly removed due to a poor post-war rebuilding strategy. 20th century Syrian history has shown that, statistically, most presidents are overthrown and human rights abuses combined with lack of a robust post-war rebuilding plan may result in the syrian people's loss of faith in the Assad regime that even Russia may not be able to defend as the country focuses its military elsewhere."], [30610, "2018-02-12T08:27:21Z", [0.01], ""], [49001, "2018-02-12T03:30:19Z", [0.0], "At this point he has won the major part of the civil war.

I\u2019ve forcasted a 0.01% chance he will be leaving office, as the following positive factors far outweigh any realistic & tangible reasons for him to vacate his position.  Economy - after years of civil war, the Syrian economy finally is likely to see tailwinds, as reconstruction efforts will provide much needed growth in the cement and building materials industries, which traditionally have made up a significant portion of the economy, outside of oil and agriculture. Rising oil prices, reaquisition of D\u2019aesh held oil infrastructure, and decreased supply instability are likely to provide a small-yet significant boost to the economy. This assumes Syria continues and maintains its strategic capabilities to export and avoid sanctioning bodies.  Population - The workforce and general population of the state has become more homogenously aligned with Assad\u2019s minority Alawite sect, along with Shia ethnic militias and loyalist Syrian Arabs. Significant population decline, especially among non-Syrian refugees, \u201cenemies of the state,\u201d and ethnic Kurds has led to dramatic demographic changes. Shifts in existing social structures are a reality of the ongoing civil war and diminish any real power that can be focused by opposition forces. This is especially true when considering the fall of Aleppo - the last bastion of the Syrian opposition forces.  International Support - despite the obvious human rights violations, there are five major international actors who had taken actions and stances that ultimately support Assad\u2019s stay. These international actors are: 1. USA - The US public and current administration show lack of engagement in Syria. Not only does President Trump not seem to be interested in new foreign entanglements, his only actions taken thus far have been to increasing bombing support while pulling out all support for Syrian opposition fighters and Kurdish Peshmerga. Due to lack of a coherent US push to remove Assad, plus the lack of credibility under the Obama Administration on taking action in Syria, the very concept of regime change appears to be more of imperialist idealism than realism, especially to the population of Syria. The US\u2019 failure has made room for other international actors to take lead of activities in Syria.  2.  Russia - The strategic importance of Russia\u2019s Tartus \u201cwarm sea\u201d Port means that stable Syrian leadership remains vital. The long-term relationship with the Assad family not only has been appealing, but is a choice among limited power players in Syria. Without viable alternatives, the Russian position is to double down, which also plays directly in to Putin\u2019s \u201canti-terror campaign\u201d being waged domestically.  3. China - The renewed effort to revive the ancient Silk Road inevitably involves Syria. Outside investment in infrastructure will undoubtedly bring work and economic activity as China positions itself in the Middle East. Syria is a wonderful investment for the right actor, which currently seems to be China. In 2017 there was significant activity and planning for post-war Syrian investment, featuring official state sponsored events in Beijing. Chinese investment will likely stabilize the current regime, for at least 2018-2019. 4. Iran - Iranian influence, trade, and regional history lead to Syria remaining on the Iranian side of sectarian conflicts plaguing the MENAS region. This generally supports Assad\u2019s position, especially with regards to militia and financial support.  5. Turkey - Syrian neighbor & unlikely bedfellow is currently focused on anti-terror and anti-Kurdish activities. Due to the focus on internal security, while undermining the reality of an independent Kurdish state, Ergdoan is likely to provide support to Assad. The importance of this being a shift of narrative from stopping the Syrian Civil War, to stopping to spread of D\u2019aesh and Kurdish influence.  Ultimately, Assad will stay in power due to positive economic factors, the downfall of opposition & D\u2019aesh forces, international support by non-western allies, and lack of a unified internal opposition to the government.

As a 52yo male, presumably with access to 1st-world level medical care (and being a doctor himself), he has a baseline risk of death in the next 12 months of about 0.5%.  Somewhat leavening this, his father had diabetes and a life-threatening myocardial at a young age (53yo) - each of these illnesses has a significant familial risk (both genetic and environmental). Assassination is a risk, but quite low.  Let's call that 1-1.5% over 12 months. Overall, about a 2% risk of death before 1 Jan 2019. COUP?\nI think al-Assad's risk of being subject to a coup is reasonably low.  I suspect the population of the government-controlled areas are generally supportive of the government generally, and al-Assad in particular, despite the ruination of the Syrian society and economy.  Given the close co-operation between the armed forces and the al-Assad government, I can't see much to be gained in the armed forces mounting a coup. Call the risk of coup during 2018 2%.  The government armed forces have the ability, but no motivation. PEACEFUL CHANGE IN GOVERNMENT?\nIt is possible that a power-sharing agreement will be put in place between the major combatants as the Civil War starts to wind down.  I think this is unlikely, as the largest opposition group, Rojava, appear to be happy to go their own way.  I think in any possible negotiated end to the war, they would be more than willing to allow al-Assad to stay on in return for recognition of an Iraq-style autonomous region.  And, of course, I suspect that the Syrian government would be strongly insistent in any negotiations that al-Assad stays on (given his popularity in the government-controlled areas). So risk of al-Assad peacefully standing down in 2018?  1%, at highest. FORCED OUT BY EXTERNAL FORCES?\nNope.  As 2018 begins, al-Assad is sitting in the best position he has been for 5 years or so.  ISIS are gone, Rojava are primarily a regional autonomy grouping that appear to have no investment in taking over or forcing regime change on Syria as a whole (and who have only rarely been involved in direct conflict with government forces), and the Syrian Opposition seem to be slowly going under. At most, 0.5% risk that the government suffers major military reversals and al-Assad is forced from power.

The number of leaders to lose their position in the Middle East over the last 10-20 years is skewed by the Arab Spring, which BaA has clung on throughout. The US appears to have largely abandoned the conflict by pulling out support to opposition forces. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/19/world/middleeast/cia-arming-syrian-rebels.html and the regime is in a much stronger position now than a few years ago.  Natural Death rates for someone around Assad\u2019s age (52-53 this year) in the USA (for instance, https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html#fn1 ) suggests a probability of 0.66% of death in the year for a 53-year-old  (he turns 53 in September). This isn\u2019t perfect but it\u2019s a start, and I\u2019d say that this is low enough not to be a cause of significant concern, echoing a number of those before me.  Assassination is possible, but Assad will be acutely aware of his personal security. It\u2019s the archetypal low probability high impact risk. Members of the Syrian cabinet were killed in 2012, and with ISIS and other rebel groups essentially unable to mount successful conventional campaigns any longer a move to terrorist tactics will be the alternative option. I don\u2019t want to discount this threat, but I do think if we could do a full run-through of the possibilities the number of scenarios that would end with a successful assassination would be fairly small. I don\u2019t have a base rate for that, it\u2019s an entirely unscientific gut feeling. Assassination by an external power (I'm primarily thinking of the US and Israel) is possible, but as we will touch on below, I'm not convinced anyone would choose a chaotic power vacuum, even over the distasteful choice of leaving Assad where he is.  Geopolitically, Turkey, Russia and Iran are probably the most relevant actors, since European powers and the US have kept the conflict at arm\u2019s length. Despite Ankara\u2019s recent statements on Assad I don\u2019t see how the Turks can enforce a change. I\u2019d expect they will spend a significant portion of the year fretting about the de facto Kurdish entity on their Southern and south-eastern borders rather than who runs Syria (obviously I know the two are linked, but I suspect the Kurds will be higher priority). Turkish statements regarding Assad are probably linked to the regional influence battle with Iran and the Russians, perhaps trying to adopt an early negotiating position. Turkey has backed the losing side in the civil war, and I don\u2019t see Russia or Iran walking away from Assad \u2013 I can\u2019t think that Erdogan is foolish enough to think they will either, given the amount of effort and money expended by the Kremlin, and the high profile they have given to their campaign domestically.  The Russian military is expanding Tartus naval facility and retaining their new airbase at Khmeimim both of which they have a long (49 year) lease over. Assad would need to become a huge liability and Russia would have to have lined up a stable replacement, for him to be removed from power with their consent. As other analyses have pointed out, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a clear alternative, not least thanks to Assad\u2019s assiduous efforts to prevent an alternative power base emerging among the ranks.  It is a safe bet that Moscow will prefer stability to risk; if Assad knows what\u2019s good for him he\u2019ll try his best to give his allies that stability.  One has to assume he is aware of his debt and will be suitably malleable. I\u2019m yet to see any striking reason therefore why he won\u2019t be exactly where he is come January 2019, but obviously as with everything on GJP this will remain one to watch closely.

Most notably Bashar al-Assad assumed power after his father's death in 2000. Bashar's father ruled Syria from 1971 through 2000. The family has infiltrated the government for a very longtime and rules with an iron fist. Although the countries constitutions reads like a democracy, it is run like a police state. A police state that has been run by the same family for decades. Bashar, like his father, uses secret police and military action to maintain dominance throughout the country. The question becomes, who will remove Bashar al-Assad from power? Currently, ISIS was a grave threat to Syria, but with the global effort to eliminate ISIS, it appears that their stronghold in the region has all but evaporated. The other factions within Syria that oppose al-Assad's government are being suppressed by pro-Syrian Russian forces that bring strong military backing. And recently Rex Tillerson has indicated, along with Trump, that Assad is no longer a threat that is a top priority to the US and that the Syrian people control Assad's fate. Understanding that the power Assad holds over the Syrian government, it is hard to fathom that the Syrian people have much control over Assad's fate and will over throw the dictator. Assad effectively has the power of Russia behind him.  Mr. Edrogan, the President of Turkey, outwardly objects to Assad's continued reign of power in Syria.

Still too early to be talking about a post-conflict Syria, but looks like there's some chatter about it.  There's also a political/pacification/influence play with the reported 3 million Syrian refugees currently housed in Turkey - roughly half of the estimated Syrian diaspora [4].

His father died at the age of 70, and his uncle Rifaat is 80. There's no reason to think that he's going to die in the next year, and his odds of surviving an illness are better than most people's. He will not step down voluntarily because if he does there is an excellent chance that he will spend the rest of his life in prison for war crimes. Similarly, he will not countenance any election being held in Syria for the same reason - if he loses power, his personal safety cannot be guaranteed, so he will not relinquish power. He will not be overthrown by the Russians because they have no one to replace him. Because of their longer alliance with the regime in Syria, the Iranians have a greater familiarity with the Alawite community and the Baath Party. So conceivably, they might be better placed to install someone. But they probably can't, because Assad has made a point of getting rid of anyone who might be able to cobble together an alternate power base, and in any case if the Iranians were to get rid of Assad they would probably have other contenders for leadership popping up, and they would have to deal with with them. In other words, replacing Assad (either for the Russians or the Iranians) is not as simple as just killing or imprisoning him and installing someone else. The someone else has to be seen as legitimate by the Alawite community and the Baath loyalists, and moreover has to be acceptable to both. Getting rid of Assad runs the risk of the splintering of Assad's followers into a plethora of warlord militias with nothing holding them together as a polity or an armed force. Right now what's holding them together is loyalty to Assad, which his family has been assiduously purchasing for almost fifty years. If you get rid of Assad, that loyalty evaporates, and other people will try to claim it bit by bit; no one will be able to claim it whole, or simply take control of it once Assad is removed.
