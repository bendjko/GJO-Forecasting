However, I believe there are a number of factors that reduce the likelihood: European colonial invasions of Africa are less likely in today's political climate, particularly with respect to large massacres of civilians. While European invasions seem unlikely, there is still a significant risk of violence with African neighbours (particularly Eritrea & Somalia). The Ethiopian Prime Minister (Abiy Ahmed) is a more liberal and progressive leader who seems to have a genuine focus on reducing violence and improving economic conditions in Ethiopia. In addition to economic liberalization, he's freed political prisoners (from the previous regime), accepted the Algiers Peace Agreement - formalizing peace with Eritrea.  The above actions are likely to reduce the likely-hood of economic/drought related civil unrest (as seen in 2016) and reduce the likely-hood of further violence with Eritrea. Possible threats to these improvements are resurrection of violence from neighbors, leadership change (an assassination attempt against Ahmed occurred in June, 2018) and political pressure from the less liberal Tigray People's Liberation Front.

In combination with the most recent outbreak of violence occurring in August of this year, and the tension between Prime Minister of Ethiopia and the regional authorities it is likely that there will be more violence. The accusations of Human Rights violations in the form of secret jails inform my prediction that a campaign could systematically kill 1000 or more Ethiopians, however since general violence or violence that happens in different regions will not count toward the 1000 figure I have set my percentage low not because I don't think there will be more violence but only because I am unsure if the violence will meet the current parameters listed above.
