So Michigan is indeed a swing state that has voted Democrats in the past 5 elections. It has voted for Bernie over HIllary. According to most polls mentioned in an article I read (http://www.270towin.com/states/Michigan), Hillary is ahead. However, is this also logical? Although Bernie did endorse Hillary, some of his supporters (although not too many) will either go towards Trump or towards independents or will simply not vote. Again, these WILL (probably) BE FEW. The majority of Bernie's voters, I believe, will end up voting for Hillary. In raw votes, Hillary already secured more votes than Trump (again, roughly 100k more), but the total of voters for the Republicans were over 100k more (https://ballotpedia.org/Presidential_election_in_Michigan,_2016). The same patterns for Bernie's voters, I think, do not apply to anti-Trump republicans, and that is because neither Bernie nor Hillary have received as much negative attention as Trump, which will also pile up.  What I want to say is that, in a sense, for a Berniee to vote for Trump he would have to move far more to the right than a Republican voter would have to move to the left for Hillary.
