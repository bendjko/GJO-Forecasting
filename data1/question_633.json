I noticed that I forcasted very inconsisently on this. In the first round of this challenge in 2017, I forecasted a rather medium-low risk. In the second round that just ended, I forecasted a very high one (90%).  In it's report ( https://unama.unmissions.org/sites/default/files/unama_protection_of_civilians_in_armed_conflict_quarterly_report_1_january_to_30_september_2017_-_english.pdf ) UNAMA classifies the causes of death into deliberate killings, ground engagements,  aerial operations, explosive remnants of war, improvised explosive devices and suicide & complex attacks. If only the deaths subsumed under 'deliberate killings' would resolve this question, the risk would be very low. I think I just assumed that at the time and also got influenced by @ulfelder, who forecasted 1%. In the next and in the current round, I assumed that IEDs, suicide attacks as well as other indiscriminate tactics would probably at least partly count, as I interpreted IED and suicide attacks of the Taliban as also intentionally targeting civilians (notwithstanding that they do have official rules of engagement etc.). I obv. already regret the very high forecasts of the recent months now, but still wonder how a resolution might look like and whether if I should go a bit up again or way down. =)"], [12302, "2017-10-14T19:10:00Z", [0.45], ""], [12302, "2017-10-14T19:09:36Z", [0.5], ""], [12302, "2017-10-14T18:54:23Z", [0.7], ""], [368, "2017-10-14T16:59:20Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-10-14T13:12:11Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2017-10-13T23:36:02Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-10-13T19:19:17Z", [0.01], ""], [38116, "2017-10-13T00:05:56Z", [0.08], ""], [368, "2017-10-12T18:52:26Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-10-11T19:54:35Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-10-10T18:16:43Z", [0.0], ""], [233, "2017-10-09T22:41:59Z", [0.0], ""], [1333, "2017-10-09T20:54:58Z", [0.75], ""], [368, "2017-10-09T20:12:52Z", [0.0], ""], [4729, "2017-10-09T19:04:04Z", [0.15], ""], [368, "2017-10-08T19:05:34Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-10-08T19:05:20Z", [0.02], ""], [40642, "2017-10-08T17:37:55Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-10-08T13:22:10Z", [0.02], ""], [368, "2017-10-07T20:00:39Z", [0.02], ""], [368, "2017-10-06T19:39:52Z", [0.02], ""], [691, "2017-10-06T13:11:14Z", [0.02], ""], [368, "2017-10-05T18:17:58Z", [0.02], ""], [40054, "2017-10-05T09:51:36Z", [0.75], ""], [5018, "2017-10-05T04:59:07Z", [0.05], ""], [368, "2017-10-04T18:22:35Z", [0.02], ""], [36147, "2017-10-04T11:54:16Z", [0.35], "say it in german : pulverfass"], [32540, "2017-10-04T07:10:03Z", [0.0], ""], [39088, "2017-10-04T03:58:05Z", [1.0], ""], [12302, "2017-10-03T23:27:14Z", [0.55], ""], [368, "2017-10-03T18:47:27Z", [0.02], ""], [22264, "2017-10-03T13:10:04Z", [0.0], ""], [40499, "2017-10-03T09:12:50Z", [0.05], ""], [706, "2017-10-03T01:56:59Z", [0.05], ""], [691, "2017-10-02T19:59:18Z", [0.02], ""], [368, "2017-10-02T18:42:29Z", [0.02], ""], [40272, "2017-10-02T18:35:25Z", [0.02], ""], [40490, "2017-10-02T17:39:28Z", [0.08], ""], [16272, "2017-10-02T17:35:11Z", [0.55], ""], [35398, "2017-10-01T23:49:06Z", [0.0], ""], [37474, "2017-10-01T23:19:44Z", [0.65], ""], [368, "2017-10-01T19:15:21Z", [0.02], ""], [14308, "2017-10-01T13:34:42Z", [0.0], ""], [15196, "2017-10-01T05:06:05Z", [0.05], ""], [1333, "2017-10-01T00:22:25Z", [0.85], ""], [368, "2017-09-30T20:03:29Z", [0.02], ""], [39978, "2017-09-30T11:05:46Z", [0.09], ""], [40448, "2017-09-30T09:54:49Z", [0.5], ""], [368, "2017-09-29T22:28:39Z", [0.02], ""], [691, "2017-09-29T21:00:31Z", [0.02], ""], [12879, "2017-09-29T21:00:15Z", [1.0], ""], [33887, "2017-09-29T19:29:19Z", [1.0], ""], [2965, "2017-09-29T17:32:00Z", [1.0], ""]]}
