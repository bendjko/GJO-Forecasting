Who knows \u2013 maybe by then even our iconic sports car, the 911, will be electric. Does this mean that you have already decided to leave behind conventional drive concepts completely? On the contrary! It would be absurd to think that we could do without the combustion engine completely in the foreseeable future. But, equally, we cannot miss the opportunity to invest heavily in electromobility. Before we leave petrol or diesel behind, the next decade will see an increase in the parallel use of combustion engines and alternative drives. A clear trend is developing, and we will deliver. I am not going to do anything hasty, however....\" Guessing that this statement by itself may not \"qualify\" as a positive resolution of this question.

So my starting point is an assumption of a low base rate (0-20%) The timeline argument: My overarching assumption here is that companies typically focus on planing for the short term (which is particularly the case for publicly traded ones) and are unlikely to publicly tie themselves to a long-term plan as specific as this, which means that a company would announce this most likely only if it is planning to do so in the short to medium term (i.e. in the next 1-3 years). But then, it seems unlikely that a company can physically accomplish a turn around within a short timeframe. Secondly, the economics might not justify the business case. It seems a stretch to assume that the economics of EVs will pencil out in the short term. For example, GM cross-subsidizes its Bolt from sales of other more profitable cars (https://cleantechnica.com/2017/05/20/ubs-chevy-bolt-drivetrain-4600-cheaper-thought-tesla-model-3-likely-profitable/). Still, battery costs are falling and EV supply chains and manufacturing practices are rapidly improving so it is a possibility that it might make business sense. Yet are there major car companies on this list that have been investing in EVs and batteries enough to be able to pull this off? From my limited knowledge it seems the answer is no. The marketing stunt argument: it might make sense for a company to do this purely for marketing purposes. Many of the brands that qualify for the purposes of this question seem to be small. It is conceivable that the owner of a small subsidiary will use it for this purpose. This is why I am keeping it as a distinct possibility. Of course companies have reasons other than marketing to enter a new and very possibly unprofitable business segment (first mover advantage comes to mind).

Happy to take a bit of punt now after the clarification was published. Still some lack of clarity about what counts as \"electric or hybrid vehicle\".  Decent article here: https://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/electric-car-or-electrified-car/\nSpecifically for the purposes of the question, does \"mild hybrid\", where the electric battery never actually propels the car, count as an \"electric or hybrid vehicle\"? If the answer is \"No\", then my forecast would be about 1%.  However, if \"hybrid vehicles\" includes \"mild hybrids\", then the question has effectively become, \"Will any automobile brand announce a date after which they will no longer sell vehicles without some kind of electric motor?\" This becomes somewhat more likely.  However, given the original reference material (https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltaylor/2017/07/05/most-of-what-youve-read-on-volvos-electric-car-strategy-is-badly-misleading/#440dbec82ed9) about Volvo, we can see the following: *  Even a company having \"an ambition to be fastest in this transition (to electrification)\", that sells about 500-600K cars per year at the moment, and aiming for 800K per year by 2020 (http://www.autonews.com/article/20160218/COPY01/302189978/volvo-sees-record-sales-higher-earnings-in-2016-after-strong-2015) is aiming to sell a total of 1000K \"electric or hybrid\" cars within the next _7_ years.  Non-electrified cars will remain an appreciable part of Volvo's market share for the foreseeable future.\n*  Volvo's shift to electrified vehicles is driven in large part by EU regulations.  In parts of the world with looser regulations, non-electrified cars are likely to remain competitive for the foreseeable future, and thus it would be madness for any automotive brand to say \"nope, we will no longer be selling cars (that people will buy) in that market\". UK will permit IC engine sales until 2040 (https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jul/25/britain-to-ban-sale-of-all-diesel-and-petrol-cars-and-vans-from-2040).  France planning to cease the sale of petrol and diesel from 2040.  Presumably that wipes out hybrid cars too!

TL; DR ... Brands are more likely to announce that they are providing more options to consumers, less likely to announce that a particular option will no-longer be available.  Non-electrified vehicles remain the overwhelming majority of the market: electric and hybrid sales make about 1-2 million of the estimated 80 million car sales each year worldwide.

I have based my predictions on a few key assumptions and have gone through the announcements of car companies based on these assumptions. 1. Has car manufacturer company made a specific announcement regarding EV future strategy already in 2017. If YES it is 25% likelyhood that they will change/modify this and for example to include a strategy of all sales will be EV by/after certain year. If NO the chance of them coming out with such a statement in the next 8 months is 33%.\n2. Car shows are likely events when such statements are made - foreign shows will add 2%, domestic shows 10%.\n3. Higher-cost brands more likely to make a definite statement of going all EV \u2013 customer base more environmentally aware as well as willing to pay the extra cost of such technological upgrade. Will add 5%.\n4. If the car maker has a large model line then going all EV in next few years will be more difficult thus this will decrease the likelihood of the announcement  by -15%. Base line is Volvo's model number that I have counted as 9 as average.\n5. Has the mother company announced an EV strategy - if YES this decreases the likelyhood by - 5% of the subsidiary going \"solo\" and making an announcement itself.\n6. If the car manufacturer makes hypercars it is less decreases the likelihood by -5% as the EV technology currently struggles to provide smooth and problemfree hypercar performance. With certain car manufacturers there are additional oneoff assumptions like with brands under Ford where I assume that the new management headed by James Hackett might want to announce its own grand strategy for the company which might be going/selling all EV either as a conglomerate or under one of the sister companies. With SUV/All-terrain vehicle manufacturers I have assumed that they have less desire to adopt all EV strategy as their client base still wants powerful and petrol fueled cars. All in all I assess it to be roughly 1/3 of a chance that an of the 54 car brands (minus those that have already made such an announcement) will announce a date after which they will sell only EV vehicles. Another major assumption that while having no percentile value backs this is that it is just not good economics and marketing to announce such a thing. While Volvo as the flagship probably won over some new customers that now value the car maker to be eco-friendly and more green, the companies that follow have as much to loose as win from such a statement. There are still a lot of people in the world who for different reasons want to have and drive petrol/diesel fuelled cars (convenience, practicality, \"traditionally\" valuing petrol cars etc.). Hence it is more smart from a marketing perspective to announce these all-encompasing statements like - \"By 202? all our models will be available in EV and petrol/diesel variants\" - than state that from certain point you stop selling \"traditionally\" fueled cars. By making such statements you give your client base more of an option.

So assuming that in some markets hybrids are seen as part of the problem but in other markets hybrids are seen as being part of the solution it could be that the US would want hybrids and Europe would ban them.

Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Hyundai - I think Japanese don't like such flashy PR; same for Koreans, so likely no. Geely - possible, although they did it with Volvo already and it's not clear whether Chinese brand would make sense. Tata - not likely. PSA - likely, probably over 50% chance. Renault - likely, probably over 50% chance. BMW - maybe, below 35%. GM - not likely. VW - very likely, probably over 60%.

Another consideration is that Nissan and Renault together have huge investment with electric vehicles, having one of their brands announced to be hybrid or electric wouldn't be a shock. You also have the highest performing cars using hybrid systems (F1, LMP, Porsche 918 and Panamera, McLaren P1, Acura NSX) allowing for a trickle down of their technologies to a whole brand.     With countries like Norway pushing for no gas car sales by 2025 (fell through), and major cities pushing for elimination of gas vehicles within their limits supporting the external push to manufactures. The other big consideration here is that it's simply an announcement and that their intent can be 10+ years down the road.

It could be done by the smaller groups (Honda) or the higher end groups (Daimler), but I don't think either would give up their market shares unless the demand was there for solely electrics or hybrid vehicles or until the underlying infrastructure in many of these markets was more suited to electric/hybrid than internal combustion. 1% since it's a year out and someone could surprise me."]]}
