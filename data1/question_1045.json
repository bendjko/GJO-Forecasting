So this is going to be a very casual blog post that I am going to write for this. So the first, let\u2019s break down the options alloted to me on the goodjudgment open and then we can go from there. Cool? Cool.  And as a side note, all units of money are relative to a single ounce of gold. As a side note sidenote, i\u2019m going to put the base rate with each of the sections and split up the probabilities accordingly. And I know literally not one thing about gold.  Okay, let\u2019s jump right in.  Currently, as I am writing this blog post, the price of gold is at $1249.65. So from the jump we can look at the two most likely categories (1200 to 1250)<Gold<=(1250 to 1300). Oh, and the next thing that I need to do is think about the due date of this, which is December 28th.  Okay, okay okay. \nLess than $1,150/ounce: \nBaserate: 0% Between $1,150/ounce and $1,200 inclusive\nBaserate: 11% More than $1,200 but less than $1,250: \nBaserate: 53%\nOkay, what would it take for the price of gold to jump out of this category. So when does the price of gold rise. And jump into the category that is directly below of $1250 and $1300 dollars. Or let\u2019s go back to step one of gold mining. Being supply and demand. What would make the supply of gold go down.  Actually, scratch that thought. On Monday, the price of Gold in the US hit a five month high at $1250/oz. Here\u2019s the deal yall, I generally don\u2019t trust spikes and don\u2019t follow them as a law. So as the first conclusion, this category is going to be ranked as the most likely. But the next thing is, when i was writing this the first time, the price of Gold was at $1249.65. That is only $0.3 6 cents from the category below. As a result. I am downgrading this category by 6% to a solid 48%, and I am going to upgrade the other category up by 5%. Okay, let\u2019s consider something else, the thing that would directly influence the price of gold could possibly be a recession of some sort. Or any other volitale events before the end of the year. \nFinal Probability: 48% Between $1250 and $1300 inclusive \nBaserate: 33% So to start off let\u2019s add the 5% to this probability to this category. To make it a solid 38% percent. To me, and maybe i\u2019m crazy, the price dropping below 1200 dollars by decemeber 28 is a little crazy to me. I\u2019m going to leave everything right here  More than $1300\nBaserate: 3%\n"], [691, "2018-12-14T20:38:05Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.59, 0.41, 0.0], ""], [63092, "2018-12-14T19:40:13Z", [0.0, 0.2, 0.6, 0.2, 0.0], ""], [63609, "2018-12-14T18:07:57Z", [0.1, 0.2, 0.35, 0.3, 0.05], "minimal inflationary pressure but elevated volatility suggests similar levels to current."], [61891, "2018-12-14T16:49:55Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [11885, "2018-12-14T16:40:16Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.7, 0.3, 0.0], ""], [63213, "2018-12-14T15:12:53Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.85], ""], [128, "2018-12-14T13:51:14Z", [0.01, 0.12, 0.64, 0.22, 0.01], ""], [128, "2018-12-14T13:50:32Z", [0.01, 0.14, 0.64, 0.2, 0.01], ""], [29266, "2018-12-14T12:28:24Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.9, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [36147, "2018-12-14T09:49:44Z", [0.01, 0.2, 0.56, 0.2, 0.03], ""], [41922, "2018-12-14T09:21:36Z", [0.0, 0.09, 0.57, 0.34, 0.0], ""], [63587, "2018-12-14T02:09:29Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.45, 0.5, 0.0], "Gold price is currently $1241 on 13DEC18.

Today, (Dec. 4th) the value of an ounce of gold is 1,236 and has been increasing for the past week. It has been in the 1,200-1,250 range for the past month, with the exception of a few days in November when it dipped slightly below 1,200. This all suggests that the price of gold will most likely stay between 1,200 and 1,250.  https://www.moneymetals.com/precious-metals-charts/gold-price "], [37368, "2018-12-05T00:40:32Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.63, 0.31, 0.01], ""], [59882, "2018-12-04T23:05:29Z", [0.03, 0.15, 0.45, 0.26, 0.11], "Using historical data from 1st Jan 2014\nTrading days remaining: 22 (with Saturdays)\nLatest closing spot price: $1,238.76     [Less than $1,150] => 2.5%\n    [Between $1,150 and $1,200] => 15.4%\n    [Between $1,200 and $1,250] => 45.3%\n    [Between $1,250 and $1,300] => 25.7%\n    [More than $1,300] => 11.1%"], [56, "2018-12-04T22:11:04Z", [0.02, 0.15, 0.43, 0.3, 0.1], "Rebalancing based on market movement."], [11885, "2018-12-04T20:49:43Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.6, 0.35, 0.0], ""], [63304, "2018-12-04T20:28:38Z", [0.15, 0.15, 0.2, 0.35, 0.15], ""], [1333, "2018-12-04T20:27:14Z", [0.0, 0.25, 0.7, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [63225, "2018-12-04T19:53:29Z", [0.02, 0.18, 0.42, 0.36, 0.02], "Weakening USD, flattening of yield curve could lead to risk off behavior, more fearful sentiment of US economy."], [63225, "2018-12-04T19:52:02Z", [0.03, 0.18, 0.42, 0.36, 0.01], "Comment deleted on Dec 04, 2018 07:53PM UTC"], [63300, "2018-12-04T19:15:27Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.4, 0.4, 0.1], ""], [63299, "2018-12-04T19:12:39Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.25, 0.6, 0.1], ""], [86, "2018-12-04T19:10:28Z", [0.01, 0.12, 0.52, 0.32, 0.03], "turmoil driving gold up a bit today"], [39937, "2018-12-04T17:29:58Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.54, 0.43, 0.03], ""], [62808, "2018-12-04T17:21:26Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.3, 0.7, 0.0], ""], [529, "2018-12-04T15:53:45Z", [0.0, 0.08, 0.57, 0.33, 0.02], "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gold-extends-climb-to-multi-week-highs-as-dollar-index-sinks-2018-12-04 https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/12/04/Gold-Price-Analysis-Bulls-Eye-Topside-Breakout.html https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/gold"], [33035, "2018-12-04T14:10:08Z", [0.0, 0.07, 0.6, 0.26, 0.07], ""], [128, "2018-12-04T12:11:08Z", [0.01, 0.14, 0.58, 0.24, 0.03], ""], [41922, "2018-12-04T08:53:08Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.51, 0.28, 0.06], ""], [63018, "2018-12-04T08:00:28Z", [0.01, 0.04, 0.69, 0.24, 0.02], ""], [51261, "2018-12-04T03:22:56Z", [0.0, 0.2, 0.35, 0.45, 0.0], "Basing off political microclusters I am currently following"], [29266, "2018-12-03T22:47:08Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.8, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [59882, "2018-12-03T22:16:44Z", [0.04, 0.2, 0.45, 0.22, 0.09], "Using historical data from 1st Jan 2014\nTrading days remaining: 23 (with Saturdays)\nLatest closing spot price: $1,230.71     [Less than $1,150] => 4.3%\n    [Between $1,150 and $1,200] => 20.1%\n    [Between $1,200 and $1,250] => 44.9%\n    [Between $1,250 and $1,300] => 21.8%\n    [More than $1,300] => 8.9%"], [62808, "2018-12-03T20:35:11Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.4, 0.6, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2018-12-03T20:21:21Z", [0.0, 0.3, 0.7, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [37368, "2018-12-03T20:07:34Z", [0.0, 0.08, 0.73, 0.19, 0.0], ""], [11430, "2018-12-03T19:17:04Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.6, 0.3, 0.05], ""], [62068, "2018-12-03T18:45:23Z", [0.05, 0.25, 0.6, 0.05, 0.05], ""], [1333, "2018-12-03T17:53:55Z", [0.0, 0.35, 0.65, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [128, "2018-12-03T15:11:38Z", [0.01, 0.14, 0.6, 0.22, 0.03], ""], [691, "2018-12-03T13:04:02Z", [0.0, 0.13, 0.76, 0.11, 0.0], ""], [41922, "2018-12-03T09:02:07Z", [0.0, 0.21, 0.49, 0.3, 0.0], ""], [6488, "2018-12-02T23:57:22Z", [0.0, 0.9, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0], "gold not bought enough by institutions."], [62781, "2018-12-02T23:27:34Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], "Gold have been stabled for the year and without a abrupt surge in geopolitical tension, capital market distress, or increase world banks increasing gold reserve, gold price will remain stable until end of Dec 2018.

Trends provided by USA Gold (http://www.usagold.com/reference/prices/goldhistory.php) indicate that the spot price for gold has stayed between 1,200.19 and 1,233.16 during the month of November. Essentially, the spot price for an ounce of gold has not exceeded the parameters of more than $1,200 and $1,250. Moreover, if we look at the spot rate over the past year, the spot price has not been outside these parameters since mid July 2018 (https://www.bullionvault.com/gold-price-chart.do).

This analysis is grounded in my assessment of the closing spot price for an ounce of gold against the US dollar for the last five years. First, the spot price for an ounce of gold against the dollar is currently $1,220.75 as of 09:52 on 27 November 2018 (https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/XAUUSD:CUR). Second, the spot price has remained more than $1,200, but less than $1,250 since October 10, an extended period of time. Third, in the last five years, the spot price differential between the end of November and December each year has been less than $30 every year, with the price fluctuating less than $25 in the majority of years. Therefore, it is expected that the spot price for an ounce of gold against the US dollar will stabilize in December. Lastly, the futures price for an ounce of gold for February 2019 is, as of 10:02 on 27 November 2018, is 1,226.80 (https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/gold).
