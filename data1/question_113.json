His efforts were blocked by Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the Senate's second-ranking Republican.\nThe changes will allow judges to issue warrants in cases when a suspect uses anonymizing technology to conceal the location of his or her computer or for an investigation into a network of hacked or infected computers, such as a botnet.\nMagistrate judges can currently only order searches within the jurisdiction of their court, which is typically limited to a few counties.\nIn a speech from the Senate floor, Wyden said that the changes to Rule 41 of the federal rules of criminal procedure amounted to \"one of the biggest mistakes in surveillance policy in years.\"\nThe government will have \"unprecedented authority to hack into Americans' personal phones, computers and other devices,\" Wyden said.\nHe added that such authority, which was approved by the Supreme Court in a private vote earlier this year, but was not subject to congressional approval, was especially troubling in the hands of an administration of President-elect Trump, a Republican who has \"openly said he wants the power to hack his political opponents the same way Russia does.\"\n"], [9755, "2016-12-04T17:24:41Z", [0.0], ""], [948, "2016-12-04T15:58:13Z", [0.0], "Continued O forecast on this."], [691, "2016-12-04T13:25:32Z", [0.01], ""], [14137, "2016-12-04T01:24:18Z", [0.01], ""], [27461, "2016-12-03T20:57:14Z", [0.0], ""], [4273, "2016-12-03T19:22:26Z", [0.05], ""], [31031, "2016-12-03T18:52:31Z", [0.02], ""], [26673, "2016-12-03T15:38:33Z", [0.03], ""], [691, "2016-12-03T13:15:35Z", [0.02], ""], [12302, "2016-12-03T08:52:10Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2016-12-02T19:18:35Z", [0.0], ""], [23117, "2016-12-02T18:18:46Z", [0.01], ""], [691, "2016-12-02T13:21:01Z", [0.01], ""], [30972, "2016-12-02T06:37:58Z", [0.0], ""], [4273, "2016-12-02T00:55:52Z", [0.04], ""], [14613, "2016-12-01T22:55:47Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2016-12-01T21:28:27Z", [0.0], ""], [1333, "2016-12-01T19:05:03Z", [0.05], ""], [26375, "2016-12-01T13:18:29Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-12-01T12:20:37Z", [0.01], ""], [1993, "2016-12-01T06:11:22Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2016-11-30T19:59:45Z", [0.0], ""], [532, "2016-11-30T17:45:51Z", [0.05], ""], [23536, "2016-11-30T14:53:28Z", [0.05], ""], [1708, "2016-11-30T10:02:02Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2016-11-29T18:25:26Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2016-11-28T21:53:03Z", [0.0], ""], [23117, "2016-11-28T13:48:26Z", [0.01], ""], [6303, "2016-11-28T03:23:49Z", [0.02], "According to the general news and GJP consensus."], [11686, "2016-11-27T21:56:58Z", [0.0], ""], [15471, "2016-11-27T17:48:08Z", [0.05], ""], [14572, "2016-11-27T14:51:27Z", [0.15], ""], [368, "2016-11-26T21:26:18Z", [0.02], ""], [691, "2016-11-26T13:29:37Z", [0.03], ""], [14777, "2016-11-25T22:32:43Z", [0.05], ""], [556, "2016-11-25T17:12:50Z", [0.01], ""], [691, "2016-11-25T15:18:01Z", [0.03], ""], [691, "2016-11-24T14:04:55Z", [0.03], ""], [368, "2016-11-23T21:28:03Z", [0.02], ""], [23117, "2016-11-23T17:19:48Z", [0.03], ""], [691, "2016-11-23T14:04:10Z", [0.04], ""], [13773, "2016-11-23T12:25:11Z", [0.03], ""], [14777, "2016-11-23T03:30:43Z", [0.1], ""], [30392, "2016-11-22T22:40:25Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2016-11-22T21:24:48Z", [0.02], ""], [14613, "2016-11-22T20:22:54Z", [0.01], ""], [691, "2016-11-22T20:20:29Z", [0.07], ""], [15471, "2016-11-22T10:04:06Z", [0.1], ""], [19260, "2016-11-22T05:16:18Z", [0.01], "Adjusting down for the passage of time."], [755, "2016-11-22T00:30:35Z", [0.05], "Adjusting down for the passage of time."], [368, "2016-11-21T23:19:46Z", [0.02], ""], [1262, "2016-11-21T19:43:35Z", [0.03], "Adjusting for passage of time"], [29761, "2016-11-21T14:06:19Z", [0.02], ""], [29680, "2016-11-21T13:05:19Z", [0.0], ""], [13773, "2016-11-21T08:44:55Z", [0.06], ""], [6303, "2016-11-21T03:13:53Z", [0.03], "According to the general news and GJP consensus."], [948, "2016-11-20T23:17:49Z", [0.0], ""], [12591, "2016-11-20T01:33:28Z", [0.05], ""], [14208, "2016-11-20T01:14:24Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2016-11-19T20:40:56Z", [0.02], ""], [29502, "2016-11-19T19:05:24Z", [0.0], ""], [28414, "2016-11-19T16:34:06Z", [0.03], ""], [691, "2016-11-19T12:33:10Z", [0.08], ""], [10039, "2016-11-19T10:08:17Z", [0.01], ""], [29980, "2016-11-18T23:12:42Z", [0.0], "no"], [368, "2016-11-18T19:02:10Z", [0.02], ""], [30344, "2016-11-18T17:55:19Z", [0.02], ""], [691, "2016-11-18T13:11:59Z", [0.08], ""], [73, "2016-11-17T17:35:18Z", [1.0], "From more info : \"Recent reports by Chatham House and the Nuclear Threat Initiative suggest that many nuclear facilities are vulnerable to cyber attacks\", so I assume NTi are thought to know a thing or two about what constitutes an attack as they intended it.

Investigation pending.\nJapan as well investigation pending\nThe cvber attacks on nuclear facilitiies are ongoing and a critical threat from Nation states or asymmetric actors. There have been attacks which could be in Ukraine, Pakistan, in the past. Now this per Stratfor: \"A reactor at Belgium's Tihange Nuclear Power Station shut down automatically following an abnormality on June 10, a representative of the plant's operator said, RT reported. The malfunction reportedly took place in the plant's machine room, away from the nuclear zone. Experts are still looking into what caused the abnormality, which triggered a safety mechanism that automatically shut down the reactor. The representative said no radiation leak occurred, and that the shutdown is proof that the plant's safety system works. The incident is sure to be watched closely in Germany, which asked Belgium to take Tihange and another nuclear plant offline in April over safety concerns. Before the June 10 incident, two out of the three reactors at Tihange were up and running, although both were shut down in 2012 and once again in 2014 over cracks that developed in the steel walls of their reactor pressure vessels. In late April, safety concerns caused the Belgian Ministry of Health to announce it was revising its nuclear emergency plan. Under the new measure, iodine tablets, which help limit the effects of radiation on the body, would be available to the country's entire population. Europe is divided on the issue of nuclear energy, with many nations trying to transition away from its use.\"\nSee https://www.stratfor.com/situation-report/belgium-nuclear-reactor-shuts-down-following-abnormality?id=899b2d6282&uuid=605d3b01-beca-4fd3-b2d6-92a0f0a41b1c But this yet again may not qualify.\nThis is a dumb question for me to have predicted on. Has not occured or ever been publicly reported and  hardly inevitable. But assume this not and assume for game theory (SCENARIO!!)  that the above \"incident\"  indeed was a cyber attack on a Belgium facility was from a state actor or even. an asymmetric actor. There is no reason to disclose. No need to enlist support. So knockoff:  50% for 1/2 year   25\n\nSo various experts were at 12 and when pointed out asymmertric potential  went up to 15? Thus  the chance of an actual cyber-attack on  a nuclear facility are say 8 using the bottom expert  review halved for the year.\n\nSo what to use 8, 15, or 25% I think the chance of a publicly reported cyber attack on a nuclear facility  are virtually nil, given EU, NATO and Five Eyes and DHS in US.

Underlying assumption is that most of that sort, at least directed against NPPs, are intended to get people riled up about the plant and get authorities to revoke licenses.  Also that the perpetrators are more or less rational & not homicidal.  Not sure those last are good assumptions at all. Hmmm.  May be easier to ask what *does* count, given the clarification.  Korea Hydro&NP - not sure if the attackers were intending to target a nuclear facility - probably have to drop counting that one.  Ignalina (1992) would presumably count because of perpetrator intent.  David-Besse (2003) would not count because it was unintentional.  Would Stuxnet count as disclosed?  Probably...   I was also thinking that BlackEnergy malware infection of an NPP would count. (https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/alerts/ICS-ALERT-14-281-01B )  But, since the attack targets ICSs generally, not specifically at nuclear facilities, probably that doesn't qualify either.

Oh the infected computer was not connected to  the internet. Hence it was loaded by a stick by an insider.

Either way it follows the insider attack scenario.  Here is some very good analysis published by Stratfor as  to the  the \"inside attack scenario\":  \" See It\u2019s important when considering insider cyber threats to not let the cyber element distract from the basic problem; hacking is still fundamentally theft of information. In fact, I would encourage security managers to think about these insider threats much as they would any other sort of corporate or government espionage.\nCertainly, those looking to recruit an insider would love to have access to a systems administrator \u2014 essentially the corporate equivalent of an embassy communications officer. Systems administrators normally hold the keys to the kingdom, and in many cases they can access a variety of email accounts and other systems of interest to those conducting corporate espionage, whether they are motivated by ideology, looking to steal proprietary secrets or seeking information for insider trading purposes. That said, company IT staffs are not the only people who could be recruited to help carry out a cyberattack. In addition to the outright sale of a valid system login, as in the Apple example, insiders can also perform more subtle tasks to help hackers. One is to fill the role that an \"access agent\" would in traditional espionage: identifying potential sources. Rather than pinpointing and approaching individuals, in the cyber realm insiders can help hackers understand a company's systems and security procedures. They can also provide company organizational charts and examples of company communications. Perhaps more important, an insider has knowledge of who talks to whom and what topics they discuss; they may even pass along sample emails that show how people interact\".

So a virus has been found at a nuclear facility in Germany (http://www.reuters.com/article/us-nuclearpower-cyber-germany-idUSKCN0XN2OS). It seems that my assumptions of governments wanting to keeping cyber attacks on the low were not based on reality. The big question right now is whether or not, this was a targeted cyber attack or whether it is a random virus. It had somehow crossed the air gap, because of infection through USB sticks. The jury is still out on this one, the important thing is to work out whether it was targeted or not, Or the chances that it was targeted or not. Some quotes from the article. \"A nuclear power plant in Germany has been found to be infected with computer viruses, but they appear not to have posed a threat to the facility's operations because it is isolated from the Internet, the station's operator said on Tuesday.\" One question here is, would hackers try to implant viruses onto USB flash drives to get control into a nuclear facility knowing full well that even if the system was infected, it would still won't be activated because of the air gap? This is evidence that it may not have been targeted. So it brings up other questions, are nuclear facilities ever brought onto the internet? Or are software updates done via USB? Can you actually do damage to a nuclear facility if you don't have control over it once the virus has left your computer? How do people usually get viruses onto key USB devices? 1st question: no\n2nd: unsure perhaps also via programming in an internal network?\n3rd: yes, you can damage and corrupt files. \n4. Social Engineering. \"The viruses, which include \"W32.Ramnit\" and \"Conficker\", were discovered at Gundremmingen's B unit in a computer system retrofitted in 2008 with data visualization software associated with equipment for moving nuclear fuel rods, RWE said.\" There were more than two types of virus, but the two mentioned at W32.Ramnit and Conficker. Where did they come from? When were they first detected? Is it likely that they are common around the world in 2008? I would not put too much emphasis on this because these are only two of the viruses found on the computer. The article seems to insinuate that the computer system was updated in 2008.  W32.Ramnit is mentioned in antivirus posts since 2010. I assume that it may have been created even before then. Conficker has been around since 2009. So I may believe that the cyber \"breach\" can be from the 2008 software update. But it may be equally likely that subsequent updates that haven't been made public have also introduced the malware. It seems unlikely that a nuclear plant could be running on the same software for nearly 8 years without a single software update. \"Malware was also found on 18 removable data drives, mainly USB sticks, in office computers maintained separately from the plant's operating systems.\" The malware entered the office and the plant's operating systems. These USB sticks should have protocol that they never be used on both office computers and operating systems but we cannot assume that the protocol exists or was respected. Again, how do hackers usually infect USB drives? Is it difficult and requires an Ocean's 11 type of plan? Because the more difficult it is, the planning required, equals to less number of USB sticks infected and more likely that the hackers knew that the attack would not give them control if the plant is never on-line. But on the other hand, hackers may not be after control. They may just want to disrupt the systems but even so, if it was infected in 2008, and I'm assuming that was when the last major update was made, then the systems were not disrupted. However, if it was infected by an employee charging their phone on a port recently then this may not count as a cyber-attack either. If people set up the employee or if the employee themselves wanted to attack the plant, then that would constitute a cyber attack. I'm going to assume that cyber security procedures at the Gundremmingen are pretty lax. That it is somewhat easy to infect an employees phone by leaving a USB drive in the parking lot. That this can spread throughout the offices through plugging the USB into the system and plugging other USBs in as well.   Now I think it's time to crunch some numbers and remove some assumptions that I had before. One assumption that I wrote about previously was: \"Do failed cyber attacks  count as attacks? Yes I believe so but in saying that I don't think they will be publicly disclosed because by releasing those details, nuclear operators risk people finding out about the security of these nuclear plants and they risk people becoming interested in cyber attacking nuclear facilities.\" However, malware has infected a critical system and it has not been successful. but the name of the nuclear plant has been published.  I previously wrote:\n\"I would place the possibility that a nuclear operator publicly discloses an attack at 1% of all cyber attacks on a guess.\" However, this rises a lot higher as operators are not afraid to release details and did so in this case. I would say that it should be 80 or 90%. Military cyberattacks from the US to Iran or from one country to another may seek to avoid this unless the damages needed to be publicly released. However, normal cyber attacks would be published.  So from last time, we calculated the chances of a cyber attack on a nuclear facility at 92%. The most important thing is calculating the chances of the breach being targeted aka cyberattack or just random malware floating around. This is really hard to figure out. A nuclear plant is an obvious target so there is a large chance that it was targeted and that some poor employee unknowingly inserted an infected drive into the system. On the other hand, random malware has got to be more common than targeted attacks. I can't find statistics online for the chances of cyberbreaches being targeted vs non-targeted. So I'm going to wash my hands and say 45% targeted and 55% non-targeted. For this specific case, I'm placing the chance at 45%. However, if it is found out that this was random malware floating around, then I'm going to assume that the match isn't quite over and that we're working from a fresh start.

GJP does, however care about whether its IFP\u2019s are falsifiable, and GJP has taken steps (particularly prospective ones when people aren\u2019t yet claiming resolution) to clarify questions (see e.g. the question about Venezuela defaulting on debt which was recently updated to clarify that a restructuring of debt does not count). I think the @AndrewSabisky post in this thread (\u201cbackground in the question\u2026 background context\u201d) put it better than my use of the word \u201cdefinitions\u201d did. I don\u2019t think GJP would take steps to provide background information and clarify background information if the context the background information provided was not highly relevant to creating a falsifiable IFP. I\u2019d quibble with your rendering the first (but not only) substantive context for the word \u201ccyber attack\u201d in the Chatham report under discussion, which says \u201ca \u2026category of cyber attack [is] when a facility\u2019s industrial control systems are disrupted\u201d  as \u201ccyber attack [upon] a facility\u2019s industrial control systems\u201d because the cyber attack does not need to be \u201cupon\u201d (your word) industrial control systems to be \u201con [a] nuclear facility\u201d (language in the question stem) as described elsewhere in the report. If you ctrl f to the part of the report @clinton quoted about \u201cthe most basic attacks\u201d two sentences earlier it says \u201cthere are a number of ways in which cyber attacks might affect nuclear facilities\u201d which to my mind clarifies the \u201cbasic attacks\u201d being talked about are forms of \u201ccyber attacks\u201d that \u201caffect nuclear facilities\u201d; for example, but not only, by \u201cdisrupting industrial control systems.\u201d Agree with @morrell that I would be interested in any evidence of any other \u201cbasic attacks\u201d affecting nuclear facilities in the timeframe of the question. A further reason that a \u201cbasic attack\u201d seemed significant to the IFP resolution is because the Chatham Report proposed to create a framework for \u201cpromoting disclosure and information-sharing\u201d among nuclear facilities about cyber attacks, while recognizing that nuclear facilities have \u201creluctance to disclose cyber attacks\" that \u201cstems partly from concerns for damage to reputation\u201d (page x of Chatham Report exec summary). Thus, this incident seems significant to resolving the IFP because it could help show that efforts toward promoting public disclosure of incidents is working (Perhaps the fact that the Gunremmingen nuclear facility is slated to shut down eventually anyway mitigated such repetitional concern in deciding whether to make the disclosure?) Note that \u201cpublicly disclosed\u201d appears in the question of the IFP. Zooming out a bit though, again it now really feels like my concerns are a bit myopically focused and to your point may have over-emphasized the Chatham Report. If I were in the shoes of the folks at GJP charged with resolving the question, I would probably need to defer to he experts themselves such as those at Chatham House (rather than close reading of the texts of their expert reports) to decide what qualified as a \u201ccyber attack\u201d for question resolution, and this incident is not exactly a blockbuster threat that helps those experts' cause of raising awareness to the same degree as, e.g., an indictment being unsealed that says hackers stole information that could be used to compromise a nuclear facility. The experts might lose credibility by  characterizing what turned out to be an otherwise uneventful publicly reported incidence of malware at a nuclear facility as a cyber attack (even in the event their report arguably did so, and even though if a person could be found to blame for the malware, I have little doubt a court could be convinced to characterize such incidence as a cyber attack on a nuclear facility). Lest that sound too cynical, I really do sympathize with the creators of the IFP at having to find the balance between a falsifiable and a \u2018useful\u2019 (know-it-when-you-see-it-happen that it was worth having forecasted it) on this topic. And their goals are noble; it's hard to imagine more important thing to better understand and raise awareness about than nuclear safety and security. In any event, it\u2019s occurred to me that besides getting the attention of any question resolvers, my forecast of 100%'s probably not helping the ol\u2019 Brier Score (sp?) if GJP's not going to affirmatively resolve based on this incident (in which case the 100% correct forecast would be irrelevant because I changed to 100% after the Gunremmingen story broke). Or unless a different incident occurs. So I'll change it.

As forecasters, we have to turn to the material given in the question/summary for definitions of what we are forecasting. The first substantive use/definition in the Chatham House report is: \"This report... focuses on a... dangerous category of cyber attack \u2013 when a facility\u2019s industrial control systems are disrupted or even captured and harnessed by saboteurs acting either inside or outside the facilities where these systems are located.\" Clearly the industrial control systems only need be disrupted, not captured and harnessed by sabateurs to qualify as a \"cyber attack.\" Indeed a \"cyber attack,\" on a \"nuclear facility\" according to the report, could be something that is not intended to \"cause a dangerous incident.\u201d Disruption seems to have been caused in the case of the In the case of the Gundremmingen nuclear facility malware incident under discussion in this thread; the facility was taken down to address the incident according to the english-language article @AndrewSabinsky circulated (http://www.techworm.net/2016/04/german-nuclear-power-plant-shut-due-malware-chernobyls-30th-anniversary.html). While this malware reportedly made it to \u201cnuclear power plant\u2019s Block B IT network that handles the fuel handling system,\u201d (Id.) something so severe is not required by the report to qualify as a \u201ccyber attack\u201d on a \u201cnuclear facility\u201d but could only affect the business network of the nuclear facility: \"Hacktivists... might carry out a cyber attack on a nuclear facility to raise awareness of vulnerabilities. Their goal is sabotage or disruption, so such attacks would be likely to involve defacements of websites or low-level attacks on the business network intended to embarrass an operator rather than cause a dangerous incident.\" According to the report, the attack could \"affect nuclear facilities\" while only targeting the \"business networks belonging to owner operators.\" The report says: \"Most attacks on these [business] networks will be aimed at the theft of confidential corporate data that can be used to garner  financial benefit.\" Others might be carried out for reconnaissance purposes, to steal operational information that can be used to conduct a more harmful attack at a later date.\" If the malware had to \"steal operational information\" in order to attempt to connect to the internet, it would seem to qualify under this broad definition, regardless of whether it attempted to target a nuclear facility specifically. I also don't buy the argument that we need to identify the actor and its intentions to call it a \"cyber attack\" under the report's definition; according to Kaspersky an expert affirmatively cited in the report, \"victims of cyber attacks\" could be accidentally infected (Kaspersky was referring to reported spread of Stuxnet to an unnamed nuclear power plant). To be clear, I am not necessarily advocating for such a broad construction of the definition of a \"cyber attack\"; but as a forecaster (rather than e.g. a judge deciding a point of law or an analyst writing reports that seek to raise awareness for cyber attacks), I feel I must use the definition given in the question I'm forecasting.  With that in mind, I vote 100%; a cyber attack occurred (100% now; I think I was above consensus but below the right side of probability at 30-something % when the Gundremmingen story broke).

We hope that the result will not be a nuclear meltdown. It certainly seems that there are a LOT of problems with quick shutdowns and emergencies of all kinds at US nuke plants nowadasy.

What will prevent nations from trying to 'take out' each other's nuke facilities out with spies, high tech tools, and/or malware, now that the US has opened that door? The costs to protect these global life extinction facilities will have to go up drastically in order to prevent a disaster on the scale of Fukushima, or worse.

The United States, Russia, China, Israel, Germany and France are the most advanced in terms of cyber attack ability, though Iran is \u201cmoving up the chain,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the Russians and the Chinese are basically deterred from attacking the United States because they know if they do, we will retaliate,\u201d he said. \" . . . the number of incidents has been growing over the past ten years. Some of the most egregious include: 2015 \u2014 Russian launches a cyber attack against the Ukrainian power grid, according to U.S. officials. The attacks caused power outages in 103 cities and towns in the nation. Russia had been involved in military clashes with Ukraine over the Crimea. 2015 \u2014 Hackers gain access to a steel mill in Germany, rendering it unable to shut down its blast furnace. This results in massive damage to the foundry. The attack was described in a report by German's Federal Office for Security in Information Technology. The steel mill was not named and no date for the attack was given. 2014 \u2014 North Korean hackers destroy the computer network of Sony Pictures Entertainment, according to U.S. officials. The attack is thought to be retaliation for a satirical movie called The Interview, starring Seth Rogen and James Franco, about two bungling journalists who coordinate an assassination of North Korea's Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un. 2014 \u2014 Hackers breach the U.S. Office of Personnel Management and steal information about more than 21 million Americans who had been subject to government background checks. U.S. government officials privately blame China. China later arrests several hackers for the attack just before Chinese President Xi Jinping pays a state visit to the United States. 2014 \u2014 Iranian hackers shut down the computer network of the Las Vegas Sands Corp., the world's largest gaming company. The motivation, experts believe, was billionaire owner Sheldon Adelson's remarks about attacking Iran with nuclear weapons if the country didn't put the brakes on its nuclear program. 2013 \u2014 Iranian hackers attack the control system of a dam north of New York City. They are able to probe the Bowman Avenue Dam in Rye Brook, NY for vulnerabilities but were not able to gain control over it, U.S. officials said. 2013 \u2014 Cyber attacks take down the computer networks of several media companies and banks in South Korea. South Korea says North Korea was behind the attacks, 2011 \u2014 2013 -  Iranians employed by two Iranian-based computer firms with ties to the government and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps use cyber attacks to disrupt U.S. banking operations, disabling bank websites, preventing customers from accessing their accounts online and costing the victimized banks tens of millions of dollars, according to U.S. federal prosecutors. 2012 \u2014 A computer virus nicknamed Shamoon attacks the Saudi Arabian state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco, erasing data on as many as 30,000 computers and forcing the company to shut down much of its computer network. U.S. officials believe Iran was behind the attack. 2010 \u2014 Computer security firms discover Stuxnet, a computer worm created by the United States and Israel to disable Iranian centrifuges used to separate nuclear material and thus cripple Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program. The worm first appeared in 2009 but wasn\u2019t widely known until 2011. Many in the computer security world believed the Iranian attacks on U.S. banks from 2011 to 2013 were a response to the Stuxnet attack. 2008 \u2014 Cyber attackers hit the computer servers of officials in the Georgian government as Russia and Georgia engaged in a shooting war over the breakaway region of South Ossetia. Georgian officials blamed Russia, though Russia said it was not involved. 2007 \u2014 Coordinated cyberattacks crash the websites of dozens of Estonian institutions, including its Parliament, banks, ministries and news organizations. The country's foreign minister accuses Russia of being behind the attacks in retaliation over Estonia's moving a Soviet-era grave marker and general movement away from the Russian sphere of influence.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:   The article says that the number of incidents has been growing, but it describes more incidents in 2014 than in 2015; the more I think about this question, the more I think that the challenge will be in getting a timely acknowledgement of such an attack. \n"], [15196, "2016-03-27T17:49:59Z", [0.5], ""], [691, "2016-03-27T13:26:49Z", [0.33], ""], [3225, "2016-03-27T00:30:32Z", [0.6], ""], [2965, "2016-03-26T23:16:24Z", [0.75], "This is based solely that 1/4 of year gone."], [19170, "2016-03-26T23:15:02Z", [0.4], ""], [498, "2016-03-26T22:56:34Z", [0.13], "I'm just throwing this here because it's nuclear related.

The Nuclear Threat Initiative's finding comes in the wake of reports from researchers that a cyberattack last month caused a power outage in Ukraine, raising new concerns about the ability of the industrial sector to prevent digital attacks. And the stakes are even higher in the nuclear space because of the potentially devastating results of a malfunction -- or the possibility someone could create an opportunity to steal nuclear materials.\nIn preparing its latest global ranking of nuclear security risks, NTI for the first time asked basic questions about regulations addressing how to protect nuclear facilities from cyberattacks. \"What we have observed is what I call enormous unevenness on the global stage to address this issue,\" said Page Stoutland, the group's vice president for scientific and technical affairs and one of the report's authors. The United States and other nations with developed programs often had regulatory safeguards, he said, while countries now developing nuclear programs were less likely to have formal policies in place. end quote but please go to link, for some reason not able to cut and paste the rest of it. We better learn from Vlad to use power.

Too bad it was in the service of propping up two dictatorships\u2014Russia\u2019s as well as Syria\u2019s. Could the next U.S. president learn something from this case study in the use of power? Let\u2019s stipulate that no future president is likely to order aircraft to drop unguided munitions on village marketplaces, as Mr. Putin did in Idlib and Aleppo. Gratuitous cruelty is not the American way of making war in the 21st century, whatever Donald Trump may think. Still, there are some lessons here for future interveners. (lists 1-9)\n1. 1) Take a side. \u201cA prince,\u201d wrote Machiavelli, \u201cis also respected when he is either a true friend or a downright enemy\u201d\u2014an approach, the Florentine added, that \u201cwill always be more advantageous than standing neutral.\u201d In Syria, Mr. Putin took the side of the regime. In previous interventions in Ukraine and Georgia, he took the side of local Russian minorities. 2) Use proxies. The point of proxies is to avoid doing all the fighting yourself. And to have someone who will be beholden to you after you leave. But a proxy is pointless if you aren\u2019t willing to support him properly, whether out of moral squeamishness or indifference to the outcome of the war.\n3) Define a realistic objective. Mr. Obama\u2019s constant assessment of Russia\u2019s intervention in Syria was that it was destined to become a replay of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, with hundreds of thousands of ground troops taking ever-greater casualties from wily mujahedeen fighters.\n4) Remember the Earl Butz rule. It\u2019s named after the former secretary of agriculture, who remarked, in reference to a papal edict regarding contraception, \u201cYou no play-a da game, you no make-a da rules.\u201d One of the purposes of military intervention is to shape the diplomatic outcome, which is why Mr. Kerry is so strikingly irrelevant in negotiating an end to the Syrian war.\n5) Preserve your options. Russia has withdrawn from Syria\u2014except where it hasn\u2019t. It will maintain an upgraded naval facility in the port of Tartus, along with an air base. Mr. Putin has made it clear he\u2019s prepared to return forces to Syria at will, and the success of the operation means any return will have popular backing. That was an option the U.S. could have exercised in Iraq, or Libya, by maintaining a military presence sufficient to suppress insurgents, deter Iranians, and balance competing sectarian interests.

Over the last 17 years, we've had 3 such disclosed attacks in these surveys, giving us a base rate of 17.6% and note that we have only 75% of the year left, giving us a nice base rate of 13.2%. For this to be true, we need three things to happen, firstly there must be an attack (successful or otherwise). Secondly, the attack must be detected, and finally, the decision to disclose must be taken. Regarding the probability of an attack, the SANS SCADA and Process Control Security Survey, 2013 (https://ics.sans.org/media/sans-scada-survey-2013.pdf) gives us quite a bit of detail. This survey finds that industrial supervisory control and data acquisition (ISCADA) systems are increasingly under attack, with 198 incidents reported the the US industrial control systems computer emergency team (ICS-CERT) in 2012. Further, this survey claims that ISCADA systems are \"under increasing attack.\" 27.6% indicated that they had been, or that they suspected they had been, attacked. However, it would be nation-states with the capacity to do this successfully. Hacktivists and organised criminals probably won't try. Terrorists might give it a go, but they're very underfunded and underskilled in this area. Nation-states might want to avoid this kind of confrontation, as most countries systems are similar, so the chance of retribution is high. This points to an increasing likelihood of an attack, I'm going with 15.8% here. Moving on to the probability of detection, we those surveys seem show that there is a growing awareness of the security risks in the ISCADA area. They should be improving their capabilities, and therefore improving the likelihood of detection. It is, however, a truism that attacks only improve, and that attackers have a natural advantage. These might actually reduce the likelihood of detection. Hard to say all in. Maybe a slight increase, as older, successful attacks maybe discovered by better inspection techniques. Bump to 16.8% Finally, regarding disclosure by the end of the year. This need not be the victim themselves, many hacktivist and terrorist groups will disclose the attack to claim responsibility. However, there's also \"low level\" threats, like the garden-variety malware and ransomware that affect normal people. These are unlikely to be reported and dealt with in the course of business. So it would have to be a relatively high-impact attack for the disclosure to happen -- no one's going to care that Bob's machine down in accounting was infected with ransomware! What they would care about is it spreading to the significant parts of the organisation. Hard to call this one. Maybe put it back down around 15.8%? So overall, 16% seems to be a relatively sensible estimate. https://www.thalesgroup.com/sites/default/files/asset/document/thales-cyber-security-for-scada-systems.pdf is also another relatively useful source, but it's more marketing rather than investigation."], [19923, "2016-03-12T23:51:11Z", [0.33], ""], [128, "2016-03-12T21:40:43Z", [0.25], ""], [22132, "2016-03-12T20:13:25Z", [0.65], ""], [689, "2016-03-12T19:34:10Z", [0.66], ""], [691, "2016-03-12T17:59:58Z", [0.41], ""], [21800, "2016-03-12T13:20:58Z", [0.01], "Starting out at the lowest level.

Are these power-plants? Weapons Complexes? Stockpiles?\nI'm assuming its all three. If a nuclear facility has been hit by a cyber attack, will they publicly disclose this information? Will governments release information regarding hacked nuclear facilities? Do governments release details on nuclear facilities that have problems? How many nuclear facilities have problems? Do failed cyber attacks  count as attacks?\nYes I believe so but in saying that I don't think they will be publicly disclosed because by releasing those details, nuclear operators risk people finding out about the security of these nuclear plants and they risk people becoming interested in cyber attacking nuclear facilities. Olympic Games was only found out by the public during a leak because Stuxnet was actually uploaded to the internet.\nDo attacks on non-operating nuclear power plants count?\nI would say that this is a definition question, it would only matter if there were dangerous nuclear material around, but there are incentives for nuclear operators to not release this information. Unless it had significant risk of damaging the environment, e.g. if people have to be relocated. I assume that attacks on nuclear facilities, failed or successful will not be publicly disclosed by the nuclear operators unless it is a leak, or it endangers personnel and residents close by to the point where they will need to be relocated. A crisis situation. However, I believe that it is difficult for hackers to reach into critical system components as it has not been done on a power generating nuclear facility. I would place the possibility that a nuclear operator publicly discloses an attack at 1% of all cyberattacks on a guess. It's possibly smaller. However, hackers who have been successful are more likely to publicly disclose their attacks for political reasons or personal reasons. This release of information cannot be stopped by governmental powers after it has been leaked. I would place the possibility of a successful nuclear hacker publicly disclosing their attack at 20% on a guess. It may be larger.  Many nuclear facilities are not weapons facilities but rather are power plants. So what is the percentage of nuclear facilities weapons and what are for power? I would believe that it is far more easy and more common that power plants are infected. What is the number of power facilities and utility facilities that are nuclear?\nThe Nuclear Energy Initiaive places this at 340 (without counting US). Their source is from  the International Atomic Energy Agency PRIS Database.\nThe number in the US is 61 plants but 99 reactors according to the US Energy Information administration. There are 7304 operational power plants in the US. So a total of 401 around the world. How many power and utility facilities have been cyber attacked?\nDepartment of Homeland Security with ICS-CERT, says that there have been 198 cyber attack incidents in 2012. 41% of total incidents were in energy sector. 15% were on water sector.   But we assume this number has been increasing every year. So number of attacks on energy plants in 2012 were 81. This includes all energy producing facilities as well as nuclear. So the chances of it being a nuclear plant out of all power generators is 61/70304 is 0.000867.\nThe number of attacks on a nuclear facility is estimated to be 0.000867*81 = 0.07. So 7% of a nuclear facility being attacked expected per year. Increase say 20% (I feel that this is conservative) of cyber attacks per year since 2012 then we have  7% *1.2*1.2*1.2*1.2 = 14% of a nuclear facility being attacked in the US per year. The US accounts for 61/401 nuclear plants in the world, 15%. So around the world you may expect 0.92 of a nuclear plant being attacked every year. You can even round it up to 1 nuclear plant being expected to be cyber attacked every year. This is an expected number and if the question finished here, I would put the probability very high but it publicly disclosed. According to Amano Director General of the IAEA \"Reports of actual or attempted cyberattacks are now virtually a daily occurrence,\u201d Mr. Amano affirmed, warning that the nuclear industry had not been immune from the global threat. \u201cLast year alone, there were cases of random malware-based attacks at nuclear power plants and of such facilities being specifically targeted.\u201d So we have reason to suspect that nuclear facilities around the world have an attack on them each day. This sounds frightening and alarming but his statement was very broad, it includes all malware attacks, some random and some specifically targeted every day. So assume that there are at least 365 incidents of attacks on nuclear facilities. Of these, I'm going to give 20 to be targeted which seems fairly large given the amount of random malware floating around. These may or may not be successful by the way.

Attacks on Western powers are possible, but as stated by others unlikely to be disclosed (but this is not at all certain - if sanctions are needed in response the attack will need to be avowed).  I note that most state-led cyber attacks on western critical infrastructure facilities so far have been to gain data rather than DoS :  data is still a relevant target from nuclear facilities, but the incentive to attack in order to denigrate is much lower unless we are in a real cold war, which reduces the chances.  On the other hand, we are now in a world where lots of state-led \"cold\" activity does in fact end up being declared by target country:  russian jets off coastline, attacks on dissidents in western countries, chinese-led cyber attacks - because it has generally become both harder to cover up information from a powerful press and more expedient politically to disclose.   Attacks on North Korean facilities seem one of the more likely outcomes to that particular problem - being a solution that might minimise military escalation.  One assumes this would remain undeclared, but then again any successful attack might need to be avowed by perpetrator (China/US?) in order to take heat off South Korea and any physical response resulting.   All this needs to be tempered by capability/chance of success, even if the intent is there to try it (and the motivation there to disclose it).

The new documentary, ZERO DAYS, public discloses a zero day attack carried out by the United States against Iran. The claims of the documentary have been independently investigated by The New York Times and BuzzFeed. Before this public disclosure, we knew the Stuxnet virus was attacking all over the globe and infecting all sorts of systems everywhere for years in search of the VFD signature of those centrifuges in the Natanz nuclear facility, Iran. That's amazing but not news. This disclosure is much different. The United States carried out a zero day attack across Iran's entire nuclear infrastructure as a forcing mechanism to extort a negotiated deal out of Iran (years after Stuxnet's launch) to wind-down their entire nuclear weapons program. Stuxnet's attack on Natanz was a technological achievement. But launching this zero day attack as leverage for negotiation is a huge victory for those opposed to military options where tough negotiations may suffice. -> IFP 113 is resolved in the affirmative\n-> the question didn't designate a time at which the cyber attack took place\n-> zero day attacks are what 21st century cyber attack looks so launching a payload isn't necessary to be effective. Similarly, encrypting systems for ransom and they providing decryption without causing damage or disruption is another.   \n->  the public disclosure took place the day the documentary was to be released, Feb 16. \n-> the documentary was independently investigates in advance of it's release:  Zero Day is directed by Alex Gibney, to premiere at the Berlin Film Festival on February 16, 2016. --\nIndependent article by the NY Times about the claims in the documentary are below. http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/17/world/middleeast/us-had-cyberattack-planned-if-iran-nuclear-negotiations-failed.html?_r=0\n-- \nU.S. Had Cyberattack Plan if Iran Nuclear Dispute Led to Conflict \n\" \nThe plan, code-named Nitro Zeus, was devised to disable Iran\u2019s air defenses, communications systems and crucial parts of its power grid, and was shelved, at least for the foreseeable future, after the nuclear deal struck between Iran and six other nations last summer was fulfilled. \n... \nNitro Zeus was part of an effort to assure President Obama that he had alternatives, short of a full-scale war, if Iran lashed out at the United States or its allies in the region. At its height, officials say, the planning for Nitro Zeus involved thousands of American military and intelligence personnel, spending tens of millions of dollars and placing electronic implants in Iranian computer networks to \u201cprepare the battlefield,\u201d in the parlance of the Pentagon. \n... \nThe Snowden documents revealed a series of technologies that can be used to insert programs remotely in a system disconnected from the Internet. That was done repeatedly at Natanz, as malware was refined and refined again, with each version subtly manipulating the computer controllers for the centrifuges so that the giant, spinning machines would gyrate wildly out of control and destroy themselves. \n\" -- Update:  It occurs to me that not everyone thinks about modern cyber attacks everyday so I'll add this. One does not acquire vulnerabilities from god.  That a zero day attack was planned means an attack took place. The Stuxnet virus required years to create the intended result because it's a conventional in that it was a virus. This use of zero day attack is unlike other conventional virus cyber attacks because the vulnerability was exploited for diplomatic leverage.  By analogy, Rene Decart said essentially, \"I doubt, therefore I think, therefore I am.\"  Similarly, to plan a zero day attack, means there was an attack to identify the vulnerability, therefore an attack occurred.  One does not acquire vulnerabilities from god. --\nfurthermost to claim an attack didn't occur would be like using the defense:  \"I broke into his home with the intent of killing him but he wasn't home so I'm not guilty.\" You broke into the guys home so the charge won't be murder 1 but it's still a crime whether one fails to achieve the ultimate intent or not.  Cyber attacks are a process, as seen in this case.  The intent of the attacks were to stop Iranian nuclear development not indiscriminate killing & mayhem -- that's called terrorism. --\nAnd in the case someone thinks this is technical mumbo-jumbo, let's take a really simple example: \nLet's say I said, \"I need to change my car's tire.\"..........

For me the 438 reactors pose less than a 1% chance of Stuxnet level attack and public disclosure (it would have had to been planned years ago). The 67 new sites are VERY likely targets.  long term:\nNot in using cyber to disrupt or damage the facility now but to penetrate, reconnoiter, monitor, zero-day-attack, create a vulnerability, etc. what will occur once these facilities are operations. These are long term attacks (i.e. watchdog groups, anti-nuclear zealots, state sponsored attacks, etc.).   Meaning a \"cyber attack\" won't be malicious code to effect harm this year but will be integrated into systems or integrate itself into code to create a benefit later.  It's therefore FAR more likely to be detected as the systems are built, integrated, checked, checked again, stress tested and certified, rechecked under different circumstance.  Strategies like creating a honey pot that looks like an attack that's intended to be found will hide the actual attack as a diversion, maybe it's built into the design and only detected when there's another problem, so the possible scenarios go on and on and on and on.  Main point - long term cyber attack more likely found during construction. short term:\nThe question says \"nuclear facilities\" which is MUCH broader than the number of reactors. This could include storage, transport, waste sites (i.e. were a Terrorist would target).  And, it also include construction of facilities of current sites and design/planning for future nuclear facilities sites (i.e. where state sponsored cyber attacks would target).  Targeting an existing, hardened, and operating nuclear reactor would be the least likely target of any critical infrastructure given that so many alternatives like the power grid, transport or storage facility in obscure countries, and simple scrapping and surveillance for a good vulnerability are FAR more likely given the chance of success.  Private companies have NO interest to publicly disclose:\nIn reading the articles and reports cited have a different objective than this question here as they're directed more at the private sector moving forward.  (1) They're looking at critical infrastructure postures of PRIVATE facilities to cyber security moving forward, (2) The lack of open design and international standard to govern/inspect PRIVATE developments of critical infrastructure against cyber security moving forward, (3) the entire process of design, construction, and operation need to be taken apart and re-thought if future cyber vulnerabilities are going to be accounted for.  There are concerns with Public facilities but covered by the fact that cyber defenses and security measures are probably secret and shouldn't be public (as stated in the articles) but the concern is Private companies working in the nuclear field and their posture to cyber security.

As a grad student in Cyber Security I'm not impressed by the catchall term when Stuxnet is certainly a perturbation from something benign like a software update malfunction. Vulnerability cuts both ways and can be self-inflicted as much as externally attacked.  I interpret this question as to leave open a benign mistake such as happened in the U.S. state of Georgia (2008).  That's fundamentally different than an external malicious attack.  Two publicized cyber attacks were internal accidents from updates that triggered safety procedures leading to shutdowns.  Hearsay about unauthorized internet connections and potential SCAD entry points are very unlikely to be found, exploited, NOTICED, and reported within a year given that Nuclear facilities FEAR of this known threat and thus UNWILLINGNESS to publicize a breach that is consequential to security because it's kinda alarmist.   Lack of incentive to publicizing actual attacks that produce harm/scrutiny and heightened incentives to publicize extremely minor incident where they \"saved the day\" to procure funding or bolster claims to be combating the threats make this question more chance than substance.  So a \"legitimate external malicious attack\" there is 10-20% chance in my mind of an attack as sophisticated as Stuxnet to demonstrate capability by a foreign actor.  But the possibility of a benign mistake of a self-inflicted vulnerability makes this closer to chance than a question of calculated malicious intent.  Absent language or a word that the attack is an \"explicit eternal cyber attack to cause harm, disruption, or surveillance\" I'm moving over 30% then I think this question warrants given it's purpose, which makes it look as though it's a much larger threat than I believe it is."], [14307, "2016-02-02T04:32:23Z", [0.09], "Summary of my previous prediction:\n-> US follow-up attack on Iran 6%\n-> Non-US demonstration 15%\n-> Accidental disclosure 0%\n-> Disclosure of unsuccessful attack 3% Adjusted percentages:\n-> US follow-up attack on Iran 6%\n-> Non-US demonstration 3%\n-> Accidental disclosure 0%\n-> Disclosure of unsuccessful attack 3% I'm moving the chance of a non-US demonstration down to 6% because I find it unlikely that there would be a successful attack on nuclear infrastructure within the US sphere of influence, given the level of prioritization those facilities likely have and the likelihood that the US attack infrastructure also defends critical infrastructure from the kinds of vulnerabilities that it is aware of.

Stuxnet and its target the Iranian Nuclear Weapons Program were only discovered/disclosed because the worm spread so voraciously. That kind of spreading is either a desperation-driven mistake (unlikely) or a subtle demonstration of capability and intent to those who might interfere with the interests of the attackers. (Source: Countdown to Zero Day). Demonstration for demonstration's sake by the United States (one of the likely attackers in the Stuxnet case) is unlikely to happen again, because the demonstration of intent and capability already happened with Stuxnet. A repeat of that magnitude is unlikely to be necessary in the next year because smaller-scale and more subtle warnings/attacks are more appropriate for the level of tension that I see in the public media right now for non-Iranian programs (that is, no tension at all). That being said, a more repeat or more extreme attack on the Iranian program might be appropriate if they are found to be in violation of the newly signed treaty. Let's put that likelihood at 6% because while the Iranians are likely to try to cheat on that deal, they will likely take more than a year to find ways to do so with the appropriate level of discretion. An attack in response to that cheating does not count as a demonstration attack, because the shot across the bow already happened. It would be an attack in earnest, and would likely be more destructive than Stuxnet was. They only way that I see another demonstration happening is if another power develops a cyber capability with stuxnet level of sophistication and needs to prove it to the wider world. A major element of that sophistication was having access to configuration details of the nuclear facility, something that requires an extremely high level of reconnaissance. China has an active cyber offensive program. Russia has the remnants of the KGB laying around, and safe havens for criminal hackers. They (and other nation-states) are likely working on responses to Stuxnet, but it is unclear if they will chose nuclear non-proliferation as their highest priority on which to demonstrate their capability. (They might opt for the power-grid instead, for example). I'm putting the chance of them developing and demonstrating the capability in a tit-for-tat fashion within the next year at 15%. If find the likelihood of a desperation-driven mistake causing massive propagation of a worm to be very low, given the kind of sophistication that would need to go into an attack that targets such a critical piece of national strategy. That kind of a mistake would be more likely if the attack were unsuccessful, but verifying that an unsuccessful, widely propagating attack were actually targeting nuclear facilities would be a difficult case to make, and I'm not sure who would *want* to make that kind of a case. Exposing an unsuccessful attack would make the attacker would seem incompetent, and the defenders would be demonstrating fear (unless the attackers were identifiable and embarrassable) and escalating the issue.

If we assume another 15% increase, that comes out to 97 attacks per month or 1166 per year. The site also breaks down the motivation behind the attacks.  I made the assumption that attacking a nuclear facility will be either hacktivism cyber espionage or warfare (combined 12.2%) or what I estimated to be a small fraction of potential hacktivism (1% out of the total 20.8%).  This means that around 13.2% of the attacks per year will be potentially motivated to attack a nuclear facility: ~153 attacks per year.  From the 2014 data (the classification for utilities is missing for 2015 data) there is a 3.8% rate of attacking utilities which would yield an expected 6 attacks per year. So, of these 6 per year, we want to figure out what the likelihood is that one will be against a nuclear facility.

Second, I define a cyber attack, as defined by Google, as \"an attempt to damage or destroy a computer network or system\".  So even an attempt would count as a cyber attack.   To me, the tough part of this question is whether an attack would be publicly disclosed or not - cyber attacks/attempts are likely happening every day.  I think there are some countries (Iran, N. Korea) who would be very unwilling to admit that a facility was attack, and the other countries that would be willing to admit it, I think they would only admit an attack if their system/network had been compromised.  To start with, there have been three publicly disclosed cyber attacks on nuclear facilities between 2010 and 2015 (Iran, S. Korea, N. Korea).  This leads me to a 60% (3/5) of a publicly disclosed attack in any given year.  I only use the past five years, because I believe cyber attacks are definitely on the rise, across the board; and so a more recent, and shorter, time frame should be used to represent that.   I increased my prediction by 12% because of the possibility of a \"retaliation\" attack (Iran against U.S., S. Korea against N. Korea, or vice versa), since I think it would only be natural that a nation try to retaliate as an alternative to using military force (and using retaliation would likely be less politically risky in countries like the U.S.).  Also, as more attacks occur, more \"retaliation\" attacks are likely to occur.  However, as evidenced by the numerous articles that have sprung up over the past year or two about this topic, I will decrease by 2% because nuclear facilities (and all enterprises for that matter) are likely beefing up their cyber security measures as they become more aware of this threat, although things can only be changed so quickly and many countries are likely doing little to nothing to change.

The Chatham House source (source 8) that cites 50 attacks is very interesting. A few things to consider with regard to the specific statements regarding this source in the report. First, it is an estimate. Second, it is an estimate by an unnamed source. The source is identified in the notes as a \u201cA US industrial control systems expert who was trained as a nuclear engineer.\u201d  Third, there is no time parameter with respect to the estimated attacks. Have these additional 45 or so attacks taken place since 1992, 2002, 2012? \nSome idea as to the recent frequencies would help with understanding the trends. Of course, the reason we don\u2019t have this information is because the attacks were not made public and verified.  There is another source (source 3) who makes similar remarks about the number of attacks. Source 3 is identified as \u201cA senior technical officer working on control computers at a Canadian owner-operator of nuclear power plants.\u201d  From Chatham House Report\n(Source 3): \n\u201cAll of the examples in an IAEA training course that I give are the same two or three instances from 2003 and 2008 at a few plants. It looks like we are picking on these plants, but it is just that they are the only ones that have ever disclosed breaches and, therefore, that we can talk about. I am sure that there have been many more.\u201d (Source 3) (pg.15) While only a few cyber attacks on nuclear facilities have been made public, one estimate (Source 8) puts the number of major incidents that have affected industrial control systems as high as 50 (this is in addition to frequent routine attacks on business networks):  \u201cWhat people keep saying is \u2018wait until something big happens, then we\u2019ll take it seriously\u2019. But the problem is that we have already had a lot of very big things happen. There have probably been about 50 actual control systems cyber incidents in the nuclear industry so far, but only two or three have been made public.\u201d (pg.15) Although I don\u2019t feel confident in the number expressed by source 8 (50), I was nevertheless going to use the number as a baseline to formulate a new forecast. I felt that I might be prejudiced against revision, so thought the exercise would be useful. Since no time parameter was provided, I\u2019m was going to use 1992 as the starting year and 2015 as the end year (24 years, 50 attacks, 5 of which went public and were verified as cybersecurity issues).   So, in the first 23 years, 10% of the 50 incidents went public. (this assumes that all 50 incidents were cybersecurity issues). A straight average = 2.17 incidents per year for 23 years. I started to set this up as a weighted average over this period, with more weight to the last 16 years (2000 forward). But the time period is the main problem here in terms of the distribution of the incidents. Plotting some subjective assessments for probability is one thing, but assigning 50 potential incidents arbitrarily to a 23-year period is another. You would then have to weight and distribute these numbers on a trend line. After some consideration, I felt my initial forecast should be adjusted upward to accommodate for estimated incidents. However, running the weighted forecasts and trending for the next year did not seem necessary.  It is likely that the majority of the incidents occurred over the last 15 years. I\u2019m only dealing with what we know\u2026what is public and confirmed in the media and intelligence community. I define \u201cpublicly\u201d in this question as an incident reported in well-established media outlets and confirmed by the source of the attack. I don\u2019t know any other way to read \u201cpublicly\u201d in regards to such an incident.  The one issue that might arise is the possibility of a regime like North Korea claiming an attack from some source with no means to verify the claim outside of what the regime reports. That scenario requires some thought from the good folks at GJP.  It is true that the majority of incidents that are public occurred within the last 15 years. (Stuxnet and the South Korean facility within the last 6 years.)  Given that the report indicates an increasing likelihood of more attacks on an industry largely unprepared for them, I am going to adjust my forecast slightly.   New Forecast: 66% Thanks to @mos for reminding me of the additional incidents cited in the report.

This leaves either former employees or foreign governments with civilian nuclear energy programs that use the same technology as possible attackers.\n  In the case of a former employee attack, public disclosure is not likely.  A former employee, no matter how disgruntled, would not cause a meltdown to endanger thousands of lives in the form that would be immediately apparent to the public.  The basic physiological screening required of employees in nuclear plants does prevent the hiring of someone so inclined to mass destruction.  In the case of a smaller scale event, such as threatening the lives of employees in specific areas of the plant, it would not be publicly disclosed.\n  There are many foreign governments with nuclear programs that work with major civilian nuclear energy systems, such as Turkey.   An attack would undermine public trust in civilian nuclear energy.  Knowing that an attack would undermine civilian nuclear energy a lifelong scholar that is working in a civilian nuclear energy program would be unwilling to participate in that attack.   While participation could be coerced, the complexity of a remote attack would make it impossible for one person or a small group to pull off under duress.   I think an attack by a government currently cooperating in civilian nuclear energy programs will not happen in 2016.\n  The last possible is someone without knowledge in civilian nuclear systems attacking a system remotely.

Yet, a more inclusive though compartmentalized notion of what the public is arose in my mind during research for the other cyber question (cyber sanctions).  What was discussed in an opinion article was how the Obama Administration responded to the Sony hack.  A key part of that discussion was public disclosure with the dilemma, \u201cGo public but protect sources and methods with limited disclosure and risk public distrust?  \"Go public revealing as much as possible for transparency but yield greater trust?\"  \"Or simply keep private? \u201c  The item in the article that stood out for me was the concept of the public:  \n\u201cThe most important of these is to quickly establish consistent lines of communications with the org\u2019s various \u201cpublics,\u201d e.g., employees, shareholders, customers, citizens, vendors, regulators\u2026 The second is transparency, i.e., share what you know as you know it.\u201d\nhttp://flatironcomm.com/u-s-takes-heat-sony-hack/ I don\u2019t bring this up for the purpose of forcing a technical closure of the question.  The Chatham House Report (page 15) discusses two significant recommendations for greater security which include incident disclosure and information sharing.  In contrast to what @dnicholson has stated, the report cites a US industrial control systems expert who estimates that there have been about fifty (50) actual control systems cyber incidents in the nuclear industry so far, with only two or three that have made public. The report goes on to point out the distinction between what the industry considers to be a safety issue versus what it considers to be a security issue.  Their recommendation is closer alignment of the two issues from a risk perspective so that less of a hazard is posed.  A significant part of the overall risk issue is recognition of an incident as cyber-related so that points to increased integration with the IT industry. For the sake of the greater good, we do know that if there were a safety-related issue it would become public knowledge.

Also based on Chatham report, there have been several factors increasing vulnerabilities Increasing vulnerabilities due to:\nIncreasing use of digital systems\nIncreasing use of commercial off-the-shelf systems\nThe use of 'air gaps' is declining at nuclear facilities I'll assume that this has increased the probability by a full % to 21.1. Next I'll consider whether actors are more likely to report incidents.  \nIn general, \"Other characteristics of the sector, such as the associated national security sensitivities, make disclosure of cyber security incidents that have occurred less likely, leading nuclear industry personnel to believe that cyber attacks are less of a threat than is actually the case. \", however as this report argues the threat of attack is underestimated, and \"agencies charged with providing support to the\u2028nuclear sector are often under-resourced, \", so I wonder if this would incentivize agencies to report an incident where they may not have in the past.  I'll assume this environment increases the probability by an additional 0.3% to 21.4%. Next I'll consider that given a war, what is the chance that a nation state is likely to turn to cyber attack as a means of attack now vs over past 24 years.  For this item I will just speculate, but I'm sure we are all aware of the precedent set by stuxnet and as such the chance of nation states turning to industrial sabotage as a weapon is greatly increased now vs in the past.  However note that of the 5 examples given by dnicholson two of them appeared to originate from a nation state (both stuxnet).  I'll assume that the rate of incidents attributable to these type of incidences to ~triple, adding an additional 4/24 or 21.4 + 16.7 = 37.1%.

According to the report, over the last 24 years there have been seven incidents at nuclear facilities (1992, 2003, 2006, 2008, 2010 (2), 2014).  Of the seven, two are not cybersecurity issues related to sabotage. So, that leaves five over 24 years. Three of the five occurred in the last 5 years. So, the trend for attacks on nuclear facilities appears to be ramping up. The most recent incident involved allegations by South Korea that North Korea hacked one of their facilities.  The possibility of cyberattack includes just about every institution. The interesting thing about this report is that by publicly announcing these vulnerabilities, it likely alerts would-be hackers to the opportunities. This is not relevant to how I assess the question\u2026just a related thought.   For a state to execute an attack of this nature against another state is no small thing. It is clear that corporate espionage, governmental espionage, and hacking into other institutions is going to be the norm for states. But an attack on a nuclear facility is another matter altogether. The stuxnet attack was likely a joint operation between the U.S. and Israel against Iran. Stuxent also appears to have reached a Russian facility in the same period (one of the three attacks in the last 5 years). The need for such an attack against Iran does not currently exist (at least as far as the U.S. is concerned) based on the recent nuclear deal. Of course, other rivals of Iran could attempt similar attacks for their own reasons. One can conjure up any number of scenarios for a state to decide to undertake such an attack. But again, the blowback from being discovered may outweigh perceived benefits. Russia vs. Ukraine, Saudi Arabia vs. Iran, Israel vs. Iran, U.S. vs North Korea, North Korea vs. South Korea, etc. If one condenses the stuxnet attack to include both Iran and Russia, then you have 2 incidents in the last 13 years.  Despite the numbers, the likelihood of an attack rises above 50% based on the events related to North Korea alone. In addition, the probability of another attack between other states is not zero. Finally, we have the ever present hacker community \u2013 non-state actors who might attempt something \u2013 again not zero.

Yet most states are not effectively prepared to deal with this emerging threat,\u201d read the report.\n[...]\nTwenty of the 47 countries that the report included did not have \u201ceven basic requirements to protect nuclear facilities from cyber attacks.\u201d When assessing the risk of theft of materials from a nuclear facility, Argentina, Belgium, China, Iran, Italy, Kazakhstan, and North Korea received the lowest possible scores of a zero out of a possible four. Israel and Pakistan did slightly better with a score of one. A full list of the questions posed to each country, which include an evaluation of local laws and regulations regarding a cyberattack, are included in the index. \u201cMy sense is that this area is moving so rapidly that many countries which you think would be on top of this are just getting their regulations into place,\u201d said Stoutland. Israel, he added was the only outlier in the Index, as their nuclear weapons program is an open secret, yet never publicly admitted to by Israel\u2019s elected officials. While that state probably does have safeguards against a cyberattack, said Stoutland, the NTI was forced to give them a low score as that information is not publicly available. ~~~ COMMENT: So, this article leads us to believe that a nuclear facility might be an easier target for a cyber attack... ~~~~ Jan 21: \"Cyber attacks and litigation expected to jump in 2016\" --> http://www.insidecounsel.com/2016/01/21/cyber-attacks-and-litigation-expected-to-jump-in-2 2015 seemed to be the year of the data breach. According to the predictions of cybersecurity experts at Raytheon|Websense, we could see an increase in cyber breaches in 2016, with U.S. presidential election cyber-antics; cybercriminals pickpocketing phone wallets; and an increase in vulnerabilities from the aging Internet, among other security challenges. In addition to an increase in data breaches, privacy attorneys expect that large-scale breaches, along with companies' handling of personal information, will cause a large wave of cybersecurity litigation moving forward, even as the heightened publicity of some attacks hasn't yet translated into a larger number of suits or more successful results for plaintiffs in class actions.\n[...]\nSo, why do privacy attorneys expect that large-scale breaches will fuel a larger wave of cybersecurity litigation moving forward? According to Whitener, because the risk of data breaches has become so well publicized, no company has an excuse for not taking every reasonable measure to protect the data it collects. So, when there\u2019s a breach, inevitably there will follow an assessment of why the breach occurred, how quickly the breach was remedied, and what the damages are, he said.\n"], [506, "2016-01-21T16:49:33Z", [0.66], ""], [16245, "2016-01-21T16:40:05Z", [0.4], ""], [15318, "2016-01-21T14:10:24Z", [0.1], "While cyber attacks on infrastructure are likely to increase: http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cybersecurity-infrastructure-idUSKCN0UR2CX20160113 the key here is \"publicly disclosed\" cyber attacks, specifically on nuclear facilities (See question links for additional detail).
