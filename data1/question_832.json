The reported fact that 30% increase last year to 13,508 deaths was from an older source dated from 2015, more current information is reporting a decline in the number of deaths from Boko Haram since their tactics have changed to suicide bombings.\nhttps://www.crisis.acleddata.com/nigeria-september-2017-update/\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/world/nigeria-boko-haram/\nSince the Boko Haram have become less effective in inflicting massive civilian casualties I am removing 60% chance that 1000 civilians will be killed by a Boko Haram campaign 90% - 60% brings the percentage to 30% The other factors from my previous report are valid so I will continue from here. A new factor that perhaps has more potential than any other to create a series of events that will result in over 1000 civilian casualties is the care that refugees are receiving by the Army while living in displacement camps.  There have been several occurrences of mass killings either by accident or intention of civilians that are under the charge of the Nigerian Army,  The real total of civilian casualties seems to be hard to confirm since many of the deaths are either at the hands of or due to neglect by army personnel. \nhttps://www.hrw.org/world-report/2018/country-chapters/nigeria These refugee camps have become a nightmare for the displaced, death from disease and starvation are common place.  The military has reportedly abused these people and many have died while under protection either from accidental or other means.  From the figures it would appear that several thousand civilians have died in these camps and this should satisfy the parameters of the question under \"policies that knowingly result in widespread death\". In one camp alone over 1000 deaths occurred in 2016.\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/23/refugees-die-starvation-illness-nigeria-camp-bama-boko-haram\nThe situation has gotten worse as supplies dwindle and disease continues to spread as the Government seems unconcerned by these deaths.  Cameroon is also deporting 100,000 refugees, sending them back to Nigeria after years of abuse adding to the stressful life threatening situation.\nhttps://www.hrw.org/news/2017/09/27/cameroon-mass-forced-return-nigerian-refugees\nhttp://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/hunger-amplifies-infectious-diseases-millions-fleeing-violence-boko-haram\nThe danger of mass civilian death due to abuse or neglect while interned in refugee camps that have been created from the years of war and conflict, seems to be a probable cause for over 1000 civilian deaths.
