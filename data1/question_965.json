However, the party\u2019s internal divisions, which may not have become public, are likely to cost it a large number of seats on election day. The party has not only lost major political heavyweights to other parties, but is also facing an internal succession crisis, which is only going to widen when the election period is over. The party\u2019s former interior minister has decided to contest the next general election as an independent candidate, offering validation to already rampant fears that groupings in the party have developed to serious levels.\" \"The PML-N\u2019s internal divisions are only compounded by the military as well as the judiciary\u2019s aversion toward the party\u2019s leadership. During the last couple of years, both institutions have gone to lengths to not only question the PML-N\u2019s governance priorities but have also made efforts to isolate the party\u2019s role in national politics. Despite such efforts on the part of these two major state institutions, PML-N still remains relatively strong in terms of electoral politics. While the party should not be expected to produce a clear majority in the parliament, it should be able to attain an adequate number of National Assembly (NA) seats to become part of any negotiations to form the next government.\" __________________________________ Comments: \"While the party should not be expected to produce a clear majority in the parliament\" was the phrase that stood out to me most.
