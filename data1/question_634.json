With earthquakes, however, one can't extrapolate! All the same, it's fun playing with these numbers. @dsarin has tabulated daily earthquakes in October starting from 2013, so if one makes the dubious assumption that there is some seasonal association between calendar months and earthquakes, the average number of earthquakes in the last four Octobers has been 116 (lower than the average of 136 for the full four years, and giving some support to the simplistic approach of the first para above). Assuming an association, then the average daily number of earthquakes  in October from 2013 to 05 Oct 2017 comes to approximately 3.67 with a standard deviation of 2.09, which leads to the revised probabilities above. The big difference compared to the calculation for all months is that the probability of less than 103 has increased from 19% to 43%.  I don't really believe this, but I don't see any harm in holding this forecast for a few days till we get more data from the current month.
