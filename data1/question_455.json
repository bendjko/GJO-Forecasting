My current concern is the battle in Raqqa, which boosted the arms caches of the Kurds.  Turkey is protesting the move to anyone who will listen, but Russia, USA and Syria believe taking the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa is more important than Turkish protests of the method of conquest.  The Kurdish people occupy parts of Turkey and would be considered a group within Turkey, but in my opinion, the Kurds have enough military savvy to protect themselves.

I guess this would give a base rate of 1% per country per year. The only cases I come to think of that could qualify is present Syria and the Balkan wars.  We can adjust upwards for Turkey, due to recent political change and neighbouring war and Kurd-conflict. Though not by that much. A cumulative of cirka 2000 died in the kurd-conflict last year. Kurd-violence seems unlikely the conflict has gone on for 30+ years. Nothing like this has happened. Let us say 1% risk of Kurd-violence.  We have a recent major change in Turkey and neighboring wars, which should get to adjust the basis upwards. By how much? Not super much. Turkey saw about four coups since 1930, none had qualifying killings. We might double the cumulative base rate to 4%. Another thing: the wording is broad. Say there is a huge drought in Kurdistan. If Erdogan knowingly does not help, and by negligance causes 1000 to starve to death that would count. With the open wording I do not want to go lower than 4%. 1000+ active killing of civilians would be enormously harmful to the regime. The West does not look kindly at that. Turkey benefits from being a Western ally against Russia and Arabs. I do not see violence against Kurds as a wise move for Erdogan. They are not going to depose him. Facts I used as basis: Base rate? In 1960 Turkey had a coup. Barely anyone was killed. 1976-1980 they had a period of political violence 5000 died in 4 years. Concerning the coup of 1971 \"the National Intelligence Organization (M\u0130T) used the Ziverbey Villa as a torture center, employing physical and psychological coercion.[13]\" \"According to the anti-fascist Searchlight magazine, in 1978 there were 3,319 fascist attacks, in which 831 were killed and 3,121 wounded.[10] In the central trial against the left-wing organization Devrimci Yol (Revolutionary Path) at Ankara Military Court the defendants listed 5,388 political killings before the military coup. \" In the many coups of Turkey we have not seen anything that would qualify. The Turkish situation seems grim. We can assume it is comparable to the other coups. Consider the following; \"According to Amnesty International, detainees in Turkey have been denied access to legal counsel, have been beaten and tortured, and have not been provided with adequate food, water, or medical care, in the aftermath of the failed coup.\" Wikipedia A purge has seen over 45,000 military officials, police officers, judges, governors and civil servants arrested or suspended, including 2,700 judges, 15,000 teachers, and every university dean in the country.[16] 163 generals and admirals were detained, around 45% of the Turkish military's total.[19] The sheer number of these arrests made at such a speed could only be done so if the \"Turkish government had all those lists ready\", as suggested by Johannes Hahn, European Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy, on 18 July 2016. Hahn also claimed that because these lists were already available immediately after the coup, the \"event was prepared\" and the lists were to be used \"at a certain stage\".[20] Turkey's media purge after the coup d'\u00e9tat attempt resulted in the shutdown of at least 131 media outlets[17] and the arrest of 117 journalists[21] \u2013 at least 35 of whom have been indicted for \"membership in a terror group\" \"  Wikipedia"], [1034, "2017-04-27T06:04:48Z", [0.0], ""], [35110, "2017-04-26T15:31:40Z", [0.15], ""], [1034, "2017-04-26T07:53:08Z", [0.0], ""], [32777, "2017-04-26T00:23:03Z", [0.15], ""], [1034, "2017-04-25T07:53:18Z", [0.0], ""], [10364, "2017-04-24T15:56:35Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-04-24T12:19:40Z", [0.05], ""], [1034, "2017-04-24T06:35:45Z", [0.0], ""], [28091, "2017-04-23T23:31:39Z", [0.1], "With Erdogan's new mandate he may push harder against the kurds."], [1479, "2017-04-23T23:18:21Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-04-23T12:47:49Z", [0.05], "Flush with victory, Erdoigan may wish to relax after his labours by killing some more Kurds.

Since the collapse of a two-year-old ceasefire in July 2015, the mainly Kurdish southeast has been rocked by some of the most intense fighting in three decades of conflict between Kurdish militants and Turkish security forces. According to a United Nations estimate, about 2,000 people were killed and up to a half a million displaced in the state's conflict with Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants. The pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), strongly supported in the southeast but cast by Erdogan as an extension of the PKK, was among the targets of the president's ire during a rallying speech in the region's largest city Diyarbakir. \"These supporters of the PKK keep on saying 'peace, peace, peace'. Does empty talk bring peace? Could there be peace with those who walk around with weapons in their hands?\" he said. \"We are the guardians of peace, we are the guardians of freedoms,\" he said as a crowd of several thousand in the city centre waved Turkish flags. \"WALK TOGETHER\" The ruling AK Party, which Erdogan founded, also has strong support in the southeast.
