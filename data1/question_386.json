Most EU hopefuls might not be ready to join before 2050, study finds A new study looking into the practical, legal and technical aspects of further EU expansion has concluded that only one country, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, could meet the criteria for joining the bloc before 2023. Serbia, currently touted as the frontrunner together with the tiny coastal republic of Montenegro, would only manage to fully comply with EU law in the mid-2030s, and the same goes for Turkey, according to the Forecasting Candidate Status study, written by Professor Tina Freyburg of the University of St Gallen and Tobias B\u00f6hmelt from the University of Essex. Further enlargement of the EU during the 2014-2019 mandate of Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s Commission has been ruled out but the question of who might join the bloc next remains an interesting debate, even though there is little real appetite for bloc\u2019s further expansion. The list of countries still vying for EU membership includes official candidates Albania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Turkey, and EU hopefuls Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo. The study has considered how likely it is that five of those candidate countries would join the EU before 2050, based on previous accession benchmarks used during the 2004 big-bang enlargement. EU accession is only possible when candidate countries meet a comprehensive list of criteria and when they have implemented EU law, known as the acquis, into their own national legislation. This includes everything from judicial reform to transport and energy policy. The study said Macedonia is the only country likely to meet the benchmarks before 2023, while Serbia and Turkey would only manage to fully comply with EU law in the mid-2030s.\nhttps://www.euractiv.com/section/enlargement/news/most-eu-hopefuls-might-not-be-ready-to-join-before-2050-study-finds/"], [691, "2017-11-28T20:49:02Z", [0.0], ""], [41924, "2017-11-28T16:22:28Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-11-28T07:46:37Z", [0.0], ""], [35, "2017-11-27T20:54:06Z", [0.0], ""], [24771, "2017-11-27T12:48:18Z", [0.0], ""], [31802, "2017-11-27T12:22:40Z", [0.01], "Time is running out.

Conclusion: \"The de jure abandonment of Turkey\u2019s EU ambition, no matter how unlikely an accession outcome is at this point, would rob Erdogan of an extremely useful political propaganda tool. At the same time, were the EU Commission and member states to actually end Turkey\u2019s candidacy, it would mean not only admitting the failure of soft power and conditionality on a grand scale but also playing into Erdogan\u2019s hand and solidifying his increasingly undemocratic grasp on power within Turkey. Thus, the European Parliament\u2019s resolution\u2014while it makes for good headlines and allows the EU to claim it is standing up for democracy in Turkey\u2014in reality is little more than fodder for Erdogan\u2019s domestic political game and a fig leaf for the EU.\" From: https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/turkey/2017-08-02/turkey-and-eus-diplomatic-stalemate?cid=%3Fcid%3Dsoc-twitter-eu_turkey_diplomatic_stalemate_paywall_free-080217 (article is not paywalled)"], [1034, "2017-08-08T05:52:14Z", [0.0], ""], [83, "2017-08-08T02:27:21Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-08-07T04:13:26Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-08-07T03:51:38Z", [0.0], ""], [36780, "2017-08-06T15:20:47Z", [0.99], ""], [1034, "2017-08-06T08:10:57Z", [0.0], ""], [14253, "2017-08-06T06:04:00Z", [0.09], ""], [1034, "2017-08-05T06:48:29Z", [0.0], ""], [36255, "2017-08-05T06:34:27Z", [0.55], ""], [484, "2017-08-04T21:43:52Z", [0.0], "Dropping 5% for passage of time."], [5386, "2017-08-04T18:13:07Z", [0.1], ""], [23234, "2017-08-04T10:08:54Z", [0.01], ""], [1034, "2017-08-04T07:53:07Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-08-03T12:01:24Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-08-03T07:20:46Z", [0.0], ""], [31450, "2017-08-03T00:08:03Z", [0.02], "Dropping because I think if Turkey was going to announce it was withdrawing it would have by now.

All those steps have serious implications and take time. This is normal. What is key, however, is the quality of the reforms behind the opening and closing of the chapters: delivering rule of law and a thriving market economy for the benefit of Serbian citizens.

However, there are two notable exceptions to this trend: the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Turkey. 2. The last report on Turkey\u2019s possible integration with the European Union is the harshest that has ever been written. The previous report, which was much milder compared to this one, was not accepted by Turkey. Turkish officials said they would return the report without reading it, and relations between Turkey and the EU have become much tenser since last year. 3  Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s Progress Report is striking precisely for what it does not contain. The year saw the most direct and overt attack on the country\u2019s peace, stability, and constitutional order since the adoption of the Dayton Peace Accords: the result of the September 25 referendum held in the Republika Srpska (RS) despite a decision by the Constitutional Court to suspend it. Despite this, the report mentions the event only once; \u201c[the RS] Government organised\u2026a referendum, ignoring the Bosnia and Herzegovina Constitutional Court decision to suspend the referendum until it decides on its constitutionality.\u201d The omission is not accidental and reflects instead a profound disconnect between Brussels\u2019 rhetoric and reality in the country. 4.  n the political sphere, the European Commission commended Serbia\u2019s intensive legislative activity during the period \u2018outside\u2019 of elections, noting that the parliament\u2019s work was suspended in March due to an early parliamentary contest in April. What it does not mention, however, is that Serbia\u2019s new government was eventually formed only in August. The \u2018useful\u2019 period during which Serbian authorities were not engaged in electoral or post-electoral haggling seems therefore rather slim. 5.  This year\u2019s progress report points out, more than ever, the paradoxes that characterise Kosovo\u2019s relations with the EU: the country made significant progress towards EU membership via a Stabilisation and Association Agreement, while dealing with political turmoil and the dysfunctionality of its parliament for a good portion of 2016. 6.  The 2016 report on Montenegro was published in the interim between the parliamentary elections on 16 October and the approval of the new government led by the new Prime Minister Du\u0161ko Markovi\u0107 in the country\u2019s Parliament on 28 November. Presenting the Enlargement Package in Brussels on 9 November, Commissioner Hahn underlined that the steps made by the countries in the region confirm the salience of EU enlargement policy. 7.  This progress report was one of the most positive to date for Albania. The Commission for the first time recommended the opening of accession negotiations with Albania, with a conditional start date based on the implementation of a justice reform and in particular, the re-evaluation of judges and prosecutors, known as the \u2018vetting law\u2019.\n____________________________\nCOMMENTS:  The alla report is here: http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2016/12/19/experts-react-eu-enlargement-2016/\nI do feel that the timing is also short.\n"], [484, "2017-01-18T16:26:46Z", [0.45], "Down 35% since the consensus dropped."], [24, "2017-01-18T14:23:23Z", [0.1], ""], [32100, "2017-01-18T14:01:17Z", [0.28], ""], [32720, "2017-01-18T13:33:57Z", [0.55], ""], [28414, "2017-01-18T10:05:58Z", [0.35], ""], [24771, "2017-01-18T07:51:19Z", [0.3], ""], [31505, "2017-01-18T07:06:00Z", [0.65], ""], [4634, "2017-01-18T05:38:18Z", [0.35], ""], [23234, "2017-01-18T04:16:54Z", [0.05], ""], [13377, "2017-01-18T02:54:53Z", [0.85], ""], [1669, "2017-01-18T02:54:42Z", [0.35], ""], [19801, "2017-01-18T02:29:15Z", [1.0], "With 5 countries it does seem likely."], [484, "2017-01-18T00:28:08Z", [0.8], "Initial forecast.
