This consolidation of power is not the \"style\" of the Saudis.\n    MBS has been keeping a very low profile recently. Then there was the perplexing arrest of the 11 female activists. It could be perhaps that MBS was never 100% successful in bringing the religious conservatives,  the Council of Senior Scholars, heel. It is possible they are asserting their disapproval and moreover may very well be supporting a power-sharing arrangement with a different branch of the Royal Family that will not include the idea of MBS ruling for the next 50 years. Perhaps Salam will be replaced by another son of Abdulaziz in keeping with the traditional lines of succession for Saudi kings.\n   October might be an appropriate amount of time for this to come to fruition.

But there are many people in the Saudi family, so let's give \"someone else\" 1%. From browsing the news, it looks like MBS does as he pleases in KSA, and maybe even rules over his father. (E.g. is rumored to have placed his mother under house arrest.) This makes sense from a game-theoretic perspective: everyone in KSA knows he'll be absolute monarch in the next 10 years, so why would they disobey/antagonize him unless directly and seriously threatened by the current king? Following that reasoning, MBS wouldn't seem to have a strong motive to oust/retire his father. Currently he enjoys most of the benefits of power, with fewer obligations. (I imagine the king has to attend events, give speeches, etc.) The current king is 82. Actuarial tables give ~5% chance of death for an 82-year old man. Since the king of KSA is one of the richest men on Earth, we can knock that down to 3%, say. And we only have 6 months to go, so call it 2% chance of him dying before Q deadline. Then again he is rumored to have Alzheimer's (though I can't find confirmation) so double that, to 4%.

In the meantime, he is consolidating his power very successfully without the need to make such an announcement.

There have been a number of fired crown princes, however, and the trend of the Saudi Arabian monarchy is to retain power despite incapacity.  Rumors of abdication have been denied; however, this kind of rumoring often contains a grain of truth.  I put weight in rumors like this.   King Salman promised to get rid of corruption before placing Mohammed bin Salman into power, however.  This is currently occurring, which may indicate a time-table.  It is thus plausible that the abdication (or, retirement) is planned within the upcoming year. While I find it unlikely that any king that just began his reign in 2015 will abdicate, his actions seem to be indicative of preparing for his departure. Add to that the health concerns involved, and we have a situation where I can safely place the succession of the current crown prince as a high short-term likelihood.

This is not a sign of faith in the succession being uncontested. You don't have to buy off people who will accept your rule as a matter of course. This is interesting too, if confirmed: https://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/world/saudi-billionaire-alwaleed-bin-talal-shifted-to-jail-amid-settlement-talks-claims-arab-media/ The article says that not only has Prince Alwaleed bin Talal been transferred from the Ritz-Carlton to prison, but so have sixty other people held at the Ritz-Carlton. According to multiple sources, the Ritz-Carlton is once again open for business as a hotel; it looks like there are no longer any prisoners at all held there. It's easier to break out of a hotel than it is to break out of a maximum security prison. It's also easier to rescue somebody from a hotel than it is a maximum security prison, and the overall level of control the regime has is much greater. This may be a significant event.  I consider the following quote to be very telling: \"Sources also revealed that \u2018majority of detainees rejected a compromise submitted by the state to acquire a high proportion of their funds and property in exchange for their release, which is strongly opposed by Walid bin Talal\u2019.\" Given the circumstances, I regard it as surprising that people being detained by the Saudi government would reject a compromise that allowed them to go free.

From the standpoint of the detainees, this could mean that either a) they don't believe that the King will die any time soon, and that their situation may change or at least their detention cannot be extended forever; or b) that the King may die soon, but MbS has antagonized so many crucial elements of Saudi society that his succession will be blocked more or less immediately. The other possibility is that MbS' objective from the very beginning was to eliminate these persons and take the entirety of their fortunes, and the story about their rejecting the compromise is a ruse to make the prisoners seem unreasonable and MbS as having no choice in getting rid of them. But if the story is true, it seems to me that if a man rejects the offer of buying his freedom by handing over a chunk of his fortune, it's because he's willing to gamble that he may soon get his freedom anyway, and with his fortune intact. Either way, things may be moving faster than we think. Some forecasters have cited actuarial statistics about the probability of King Salman dying in a given time frame. This is fine as far as it goes, but we are not talking about a statistical profile of an 82-year-old man. We are talking about *this* 82-year-old man. The question is, then, what are the odds of *him* dying? And the answer is, we don't know. Aside from some rumors about his having Alzheimer's, we have no idea about the state of his health. But one thing we can say with absolute confidence is that Muhammad bin Salman does. I consider it possible that these kinds of changes in the status of MbS' enemies, especially possible rivals within the dynasty, might provide clues to what MbS thinks of his father's chances of living out the year (or until October, as the case may be)."], [28414, "2018-01-15T12:57:06Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [37488, "2018-01-15T04:04:39Z", [0.13, 0.0, 0.87], ""], [48786, "2018-01-14T22:49:33Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1034, "2018-01-14T22:09:18Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [368, "2018-01-14T21:53:39Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [48765, "2018-01-14T18:40:08Z", [0.15, 0.15, 0.7], ""], [47894, "2018-01-14T17:32:58Z", [0.15, 0.0, 0.85], ""], [30485, "2018-01-14T15:59:09Z", [0.1, 0.0, 0.9], ""], [1667, "2018-01-14T13:52:30Z", [0.05, 0.0, 0.95], ""], [48731, "2018-01-14T13:51:07Z", [0.8, 0.0, 0.2], ""], [45778, "2018-01-14T11:03:20Z", [0.35, 0.0, 0.65], ""], [48494, "2018-01-14T10:41:14Z", [0.15, 0.05, 0.8], ""], [48512, "2018-01-14T07:51:06Z", [0.18, 0.02, 0.8], "Chance of dying within a year at 82 is 7%.

I think it's improbable - close to impossible - that Salman will abdicate, and as @Khalid points out below, he is statistically unlikely to die in within the time frame of this question. Still, I think  it's worth asking, why is all this happening now? Why is Muhammad bin Salman more or less feverishly clearing the path for his succession? If King Salman is in poor health, that will be a closely kept secret, but MbS will surely know the state of his father's health. Is he acting now because time is running out? MbS has to act while his father is still on the throne, because the authority for his reforms must come from the King. MbS has no mandate on his own to make sweeping changes - and his very position as Crown Prince is in itself a change that might be challenged. Having said all this, I realize that this question may close as a \"Yes,\" but Muhammad bin Salman may nevertheless eventually wind up being removed as King of Saudi Arabia somewhere along the line. It took over two years, for example, to get rid of Richard III of England in 1485. And I think that comparison class is apt: I consider succession in Saudi Arabia to have more in common with dynastic politics in late medieval England than with any modern state. So just as the Wars of the Roses were fought between rival branches of descendants of Edward III, Saudi politics is essentially a dynastic struggle between rival branches of descendants of ibn Saud. It remains to be seen whether MbS' efforts will preempt a violent or protracted struggle, or are just the first moves in one. But there are two things to bear in mind: even what appear to be tiny missteps can wind up being fatal, and alliances in the Middle East are fluid and rarely entail scrupulous ideological or religious alignments.

As things stand, even old and ill, the king could last for years (as has UK queen and consort who are hitting 100) - perhaps Mohammend bin Salman doesn't want to wait that long, and with competiton from brothers and cousins for top spot he might be pushing for dominance among them.  -Family seems a bit clueless to fact that their heads are being pointed towards the figurative guillotine. They demonstrated in front of the palace, as is their civic right, but it about having to pay their own utility bills.   I suspect the king, while probably suffering the mental and physical ills of old age is probably sharper than many give him credit for - he might be directing his son's actions to some degree, to favour his preferred outcome. - The fact that he imprisoned own family due to disorderly conduct in front of palace for not wanting to pay their own bills will be very popular with Saudis in current Saudi economic climate of cuts,  I should think - Not sure if he will be successful by October, but it is very likely, I think that he could talk his father into abdicating in favour of him, especailly if he shows this sort of tough leadership.

He is almost 82 years old and while likely well cared for, he is about to become the oldest Saudi monarch ever and there are known health problems in the Saudi Royal Family that have felled other monarchs much earlier in life.   Using American 2014 actuarial tables to get a ballpark forecast, his probability of dying during coming year (were he an average U.S. citizen is approximately 7.2% rising to 7.9% should he make it to his 83rd birthday.   For the first scenario I cost in both familial health problems and discount for his likely high standard of medical care to arrive at a percentage based on a 2014 actuarial chart for U.S. citizens.  I also cost/discount for the possibility of a planned abdication and transition placing MBS on the throne though this move would be unprecedented and thus the costing is not particularly steep. For the second scenario I arrived at a rough projection based on separate possibilities of assassination and coup scenarios.  This ball park figure wraps in the declining prevalence of coups around the globe and the absence of recent coups or critical economic risk factors (HDI ranking has had a strong correlation with coups over the last 10 years) in Saudi Arabia particularly.   I balance this against the delicate situation that is emerging within the Saudi government and royal family (with many unknowns and a great deal of situational opacity) and the steps taken by MBS and the current King to deal with the potential adversaries.  One must also consider that the structure of the Saudi security services presents us with a classic case of \"coup proofing\" which makes defending against or preventing coups much easier.  There have been assassination attempts and similar breaches of security targeting high-level Saudi royals in recent years and because assassination plots might be viewed as easier to accomplish than an outright coup, I actually apply a steeper discount to coups than I do to assassinations.  One discounting factor that is worth mentioning for assassination scenarios is that in this scenario it would have to involve the simultaneous mortality of both the MBS and the King.  Playing out various sub-scenarios make this seem less likely.  When considering assassinations, the potential number of involved parties grows to include terrorist networks like IS or Al Qaeda and affiliates of Iran/The Iranian Revolutionary Guard. For the third scenario I simply assume, because I used mutual exclusivity as a fundamental principle for the first two forecasts, I simply subtract the first two probabilities from this component of the forecast.

First, I don't think MbS is \"expendable.\" Now that he's been turned loose, for King Salman to try to rein him in and say it was all just a terrible mistake with MbS overstepping his bounds will not satisfy the victims of MbS' purge and their allies. The damage to the traditional regime has been done, and the King can't rewind to a time before it happened, even if he decides it's gone too far. I think now that MbS has been given the opportunity to try to consolidate power (for the future) the King can't disassociate himself from it. If MbS' effort was to fail, and he was himself arrested and purged (which I still think could happen), the best Salman could hope for would be a forced abdication for failing to control MbS. Second, Muhammad bin Salman has been a hawk in Yemen, but this in itself is not unprecedented. Saudi Arabia backed insurgents fighting Nasser's Egypt in the 1960s. In that case, the Saudis were afraid of secular nationalists at their back door, and now they're afraid of Iranians. But there was never any reason to think that the Saudis would permit another regional power to control or have a prevailing influence in Yemen. What's unprecedented is not the war as such, but MbS' heavy hand. This was a bad strategy for the Saudis, because it reveals that their military is not terribly effective. Moreover, the reason that 50 years ago the Saudis could restrict themselves to discreet arms shipments to the Yemeni monarchists is that they had the guarantee of U.S. intervention in the event of  a military confrontation with Egypt (Kennedy sent a squadron of planes to Saudi Arabia to demonstrate this). Today, the Saudis are probably a lot less confident of American military support in the event of war. So MbS' more militant stance, while a departure to some extent, has some rational basis given the current context. Finally, it seems to me that letting Muhammad bin Salman arrest other princes, take over assorted government ministries, imprison businessmen for \"corruption,\" etc. is more than just muscle-flexing. MbS may be trying to impress his supporters and overawe his opponents, but I don't think it's quite that easy. Saudi Arabia (up until now, anyway) has been run by means of networks of personal loyalties and affiliations. Everybody is a member of a tribe, a member of an extended family or branch of the Saud family, and the employees of the ministries and civil service are recipients of patronage. You can arrest the guy at the top of the pyramid, but the pyramid doesn't disappear, and you can't get rid of everybody who owes his position, and his loyalty, to your opponents. MbS is banking on loyalty to the other princes not counting when Salman dies. I'm not sure that's a safe bet for MbS, and he may find that the rank-and-file of the ministries, the police, and the military prefer someone else. That's why I give \"Someone Else\" the same odds as MbS for succeeding to the throne if Salman dies in 2018."], [43003, "2017-12-29T02:13:37Z", [0.13, 0.02, 0.85], "I spoke with a Saudi expert who had lived there and keeps tabs on the politics. He said that if MBS was going to be king, he'd have done it before he cracked down on the other princes for 'corruption'. His take was the crackdown was a flex of muscles to let the leadership know they've picked the right guy.  He also said to take note of MBS pushing forth the Yemeni war, as no other Saud has been a war hawk since old man Saud who founded Saudi Arabia. Between the hawk tendencies and the corruption crackdown, MBS is putting the family on notice that he intends to be a strong king.  On the other hand, the current king is known to have some form of dementia (not sure if that is public knowledge) and that leads me to bump up my estimate by 3% as it changes morality tables and the family to find a strong replacement when the time comes.  On the other hand, MBS is far younger than any other known king, which is a significant break with tradition. That hints that he's going to be 'seasoned' a while.  Overall, if we had a time machine to replay the next 10 months 100 times, I think there'd be a new king 13 out of 100 times."], [37488, "2017-12-29T01:57:21Z", [0.1, 0.05, 0.85], "I thought this was an interesting read, thanks to @Prognosticating-Beek for posting in http://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/650073 and for @September for re-posting it. It seems like most of the options don't have Moh. bin Salman becoming king directly.  It also seems likely to me that MbS is rushing to boldly try out new policies as a test of political strength and new wave of political/social politics to prove whether he is able to reposition KSA in as a more central leader in the Middle East and put it in better economic and political power and advance certain limited social reforms without things imploding.  I guess I don't see his MbS's activity as such a clear sign of plans to pass off leadership.  It seems more like a leash to test out the waters and see if his brand of political and social leadership is something people will salute if they run it up the flagpole.  He is a rather EXPENDABLE resource in this way, I think, and something that KSA needs right now.   They have growing young population, many of them with education (thanks to the previous King Abdullah's education projects to improve universities in KSA and send students abroad) but not always with jobs.  The economy is still largely dependent on oil even though there have been efforts to diversify over the past decade or more.  The social pressure within is increasingly complicated because there is still a very high value on traditional culture and religious practices even though there are equally strong pressures to modernize in some ways without dividing social unity.  And the situation in the Middle East, especially now with Iran powering up, require some urgent change or a loss of perceived, if not real, power and influence.  I know a lot of people are are leaning toward Mohammed bin Salman becoming king pretty quickly, and I know there have been rumors in the press (everyone likes a good story).  But the averages here in favor of MbS seem surprisingly high (45%), and if anyone has any thoughts about why they think it's likely that Mohammed bin Salman might be very likely to be named king before October (or might not be), I'd love to hear any of your thoughts!
