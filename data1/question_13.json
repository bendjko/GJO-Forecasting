Of course not, says Vatican ROME, August 28, 2015 (LifeSiteNews) -- While mainstream media is gushing with news today that Pope Francis allegedly praised a children\u2019s book that promotes gender theory, the Vatican is decrying what they called the \"manipulation\" of a cordial letter from an official in the Secretariat of State to suggest that the Vatican is promoting teachings contrary to the Gospel. Italian children\u2019s author Francesca Pardi was reported by The Guardian to have submitted a parcel of children\u2019s books promoting the acceptance of homosexuality and gender theory to Pope Francis in June.  The Guardian is reporting that Pardi has now \u201cfound an unlikely supporter in Pope Francis,\u201d who through his staff has responded to the author and is presented as \u201cpraising her work.\u201d  It quotes the following from a July 9 letter to Pardi from the Vatican. \u201cHis holiness is grateful for the thoughtful gesture and for the feelings which it evoked, hoping for an always more fruitful activity in the service of young generations and the spread of genuine human and Christian values,\u201d wrote a senior official at the Vatican Secretariat of State.   In a press release, the Vatican made clear that the friendly reply letter to the author in no way approves of attitudes or positions that are contrary to Catholic teaching and the Gospels.  The original letter merely \"acknowledged receipt\" of the materials sent by Pardi, and also made clear that the letter was private and not meant for publication. \"In no way does a letter from the Secretary of State intend to endorse behaviors and teachings not in keeping with the Gospel,\" says the statement, decrying the \"manipulation\" of the letter.  The blessing of the pope at the end of the letter was meant to be for the author herself, and not to affirm positions concerning gender theory that are contrary to the Church's teaching. Using the letter to this end is erroneous, he said. Pope Francis has strongly condemned the notion of \u201cgender theory\u201d on numerous occasions, saying that it is an \u201cerror of the human mind that leads to so much confusion.\u201d COMMENT:  I was stunned to read that the Pope had endorsed a book with such a story-line.
