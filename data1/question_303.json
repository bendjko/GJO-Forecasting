The Iran Mission Center will bring together analysts, operations personnel and specialists from across the CIA to work collectively on Iran and bring to bear the range of the agency\u2019s capabilities, including covert action. In that respect it is similar to a new Korea Mission Center that the CIA announced last month to address North Korea\u2019s efforts to develop long-range nuclear missiles. The CIA didn\u2019t publicly announce the new Iran organization. The agency declined to comment. CIA Director Mike Pompeo is a longtime Iran hawk, and the U.S. officials said his emphasis on the threat the country poses to U.S. national-security interests is reflected in the establishment of the new center. In April, in his first public remarks since taking the helm at the spy agency, Mr. Pompeo warned that Iran was \u201con the march.\u201d \u201cWhether its enormous increased capacity to deliver missile systems into Israel from Hezbollah, their increased strength in and around Mosul with the Shia militias, the work that they\u2019ve done to support the Houthis to fire missiles against the Saudis\u2014the list of Iranian transgressions has increased dramatically since the date that the JCPOA was signed,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said then, referring the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the 2015 agreement that Iran struck with the U.S. and other world powers to limit its nuclear program. Both Mr. Pompeo and President Donald Trump have criticized that deal\u2014the director has called the agreement a \u201cmistake\u201d for U.S. national security\u2014and have vowed to hold Iran accountable to its terms. \u201cWe\u2019re actively engaged in a lot of work to assist the president, making sure he has an understanding of where the Iranians are complying and where they might not be,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington in April. The CIA previously had brought analysts and operational personnel under one roof to address Iran, as part of the Iran Operations Division, internally known as Persia House. It was later subsumed into a broader regional division. But breaking the Iran Mission Center out into a new, stand-alone entity is a sign that the CIA and the White House are elevating the country\u2019s importance as an intelligence target and making it a priority alongside other countries such as Russia and North Korea, current and former officials said (para. 1-10).

It was clear in Iran\u2019s presidential elections that neither Rouhani or his opponents are seeing the economic improvement that they hoped the JCPOA would provide - it was a key campaign issue. \nNew sanctions, along with the fact that some sanctions under the agreement still remain; \u201cthose remaining are still discouraging European banks from providing desperately needed financing for business deals and infrastructure projects in Iran\u201d (https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/28/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal-hassan-rouhani-donald-trump.html?_r=0) will continue to be a deterrent to foreign banks.

As such, without cause or justification, the United States would be in breach of international law if it simply walks away from the Agreement. However, as laid out in the United National Security Council Resolution blessing the deal, the Agreement provides the parties with a possibility to withdraw from the agreement through a \u201csnapback\u201d mechanism. This allows any of the six parties to the Agreement to flag significant non-compliance and, if concerns remain unresolved, snap back all sanctions previously leveled against Iran. Nowhere in the Agreement is \u201csignificant non-compliance\u201d defined, leaving the definition and scope up to each individual member. \u201d(http://www.yjil.yale.edu/is-the-trump-administration-bound-by-the-iran-deal/) \nAs non-compliance is not defined, it might be possible for Trump\u2019s team to say Iran is not complying by using the ballistic missile tests as \u201cviolating the spirit of the agreement\u201d. (https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/23/trump-administrations-iran-policy-dangerous-flawed). If the administration raises this as non-compliance it would have to be discussed amongst the other members of the JCPOA first, which, if it is raised in a couple months when Trump has to decide whether he will sign off on waivers, could take the date of imposing sanctions past November 1st.

Furthermore, its withdrawal from the Iranian deal would undermine the United States' efforts to draw other aspiring nuclear powers, namely North Korea, to the negotiating table. The Right Tools for the Job\nBut the nuclear program isn't the only issue at stake. The Obama administration pursued negotiations over the JCPOA having determined that Iran's nuclear development, of all its activities, was the greatest threat to regional and U.S. national security. Because of the negotiations' strict focus, sanctions became the penalty only for actions related to nuclear development; Washington tacitly promised Tehran that it would not reinstate the measures for other offenses, such as human rights violations or aggressive foreign policy. That doesn't mean the Obama administration gave up its prerogative to respond to these kinds of provocations, but rather that it responded to them differently. The Trump administration, by contrast, has made clear that it intends to take Iran to task on issues such as its ballistic missile program, its human rights record and, in particular, its involvement in regional conflicts. Considering that support for its proxy militias and the pursuit of a ballistic missile program are two cornerstones of its foreign policy, however, Iran isn't likely to give them up anytime soon. So as the Trump administration considers the possible repercussions of reinstating sanctions on Iran, it must also weigh the strategic benefits that using its strongest lever against Tehran could yield. Short of reinstating sanctions, the United States has several other options at its disposal for countering Iran. Washington could, for example, impose new sanctions on sectors outside Iran's energy industry or redouble its support for its regional allies in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). In fact, Secretary of Defense James Mattis' recent tour of the Middle East was intended to do just that. The United States has also taken a more proactive role in promoting further alliances and cooperation among its partners in the region. Trump has been encouraging Saudi Arabia, where he is reportedly considering making a visit next month, to improve its ties with Egypt and Iraq. So far, the effort seems to be gaining traction, especially in Egypt. At the same time, the United States, along with Israel, will continue to conduct covert operations against Iran. The JCPOA, of course, is not a bilateral deal. If Washington lacks the support of its other co-signers, particularly the United Kingdom, France and Germany, pulling out of the framework could jeopardize its relationships with its European allies. And so long as Iran keeps adhering to the JCPOA, the agreement's European signatory countries will keep supporting it; Iran will try to use the quarterly review meeting as an opportunity to make sure of that. The biggest advocates of maintaining the pact may not be in Europe, however, but in the GCC, where the security ramifications of its failure are the most serious.

Vietnam is the Southeast Asian country most openly at odds with China over the waterway since the Philippines pulled back from confrontation under President Rodrigo Duterte. After what China said were \"positive\" talks on the South China Sea last week between President Xi Jinping and Vietnamese President Tran Dai Quang, the joint statement stressed the need to control differences. Both countries agreed to \"manage and properly control maritime disputes, not take any actions to complicate the situation or expand the dispute, and maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea\", it added. The document, released by the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said both had a \"candid and deep\" exchange of views on maritime issues, and agreed to use an existing border talks mechanism to look for a lasting resolution.

But now, the government is offering international oil companies their biggest role since 1979, when the newly-founded Islamic Republic nationalized the country\u2019s reserves. In theory, it\u2019s an attractive proposition for both sides. Iran needs oil revenue to revive its economy, the third-largest in the Middle East, which was set back by years of sanctions. Foreign companies are tempted by the potential profits that could be made even without a rebound in the price of oil. But there are plenty of risks to investing in Iran. Among them: that the U.S. will impose new sanctions on the country under President Donald Trump, who opposes the 2015 deal that allowed Iran to reintegrate into the world economy, and that May elections in Iran will produce a leader less welcoming to foreign investment. The Situation Iran\u2019s oil output has settled just below its pre-sanction level, following the lifting of most measures in January 2016 after Iran reined in its nuclear program under its agreement with world powers. In a November deal among members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut output, Iran was granted an exemption allowing it to raise production further. Expanding development of its oil fields will require outside technology, management expertise and capital, so the government has called on foreign companies to invest $100 billion in the oil industry. One obstacle has been the relatively poor contract terms Iran provided in the past. Iran\u2019s cabinet approved a new model contract in August but only after Iranian conservatives, who oppose President Hassan Rouhani\u2019s efforts to bring foreign investment into Iran, forced the government to make amendments. Details, such as how investors will be regulated and how disputes will be resolved, were not made public. In November, France\u2019s Total reached a non-binding agreement to develop a natural gas field in Iran, and the next month Royal Dutch Shell signed a deal to assess three of the country\u2019s largest oil and gas fields. The Background From the first concession given to a British speculator in 1901 until the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran had almost no control over its most precious natural resource. For several decades the British government, through its majority stake in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, effectively owned Iran\u2019s oil and received the lion\u2019s share of the profits. After years of mounting discontent, Iran\u2019s parliament nationalized the country\u2019s oil fields in 1951. The politician who spearheaded the takeover, Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh, was deposed in a coup backed by British and U.S. intelligence services two years later, and the power of the Western-backed Shah was restored. When Islamic revolutionaries overthrew the Shah in 1979, one of their first acts was to renationalize Iran\u2019s oil. For two decades, no foreign oil companies operated in Iran. When they came back in the late 1990s they operated under short-term contracts that paid them a fixed fee to explore for oil and develop fields, with all the risks that entailed, but they got no share of production profits. Most of those companies stopped operating in Iran by 2010, as political risks started to outweigh the benefits. The Argument Can Iran attract the top technology, hefty investments and long-term commitments it seeks? Big oil companies won\u2019t pass up Iran\u2019s fields lightly. The country\u2019s crude is cheap to extract: Costs are less than half those in Mexico, for instance. And Iran holds about 10 percent of the world\u2019s proven reserves. But the list of risks is long. Business regulations in Iran are complex. Investors will have to enter a joint venture with a local partner, making it harder to comply with international anti-corruption legislation and the remaining U.S. sanctions. The government hasn\u2019t clarified whether it will agree to settle disputes through tribunals such as the International Court of Arbitration. Longer-term contracts will offer more opportunity to exploit difficult fields but will also lock investors into an unpredictable environment. Conservative cleric Ebrahim Raisi could unseat Rouhani in elections in May, and would likely be less receptive to investors. Trump has argued that the nuclear deal is unacceptably favorable to Iran. Under his presidency, the U.S. could impose new sanctions on Iran or tighten existing ones (para. 1-4). Wilkin, S. (2017). Iran\u2019s Oil. Bloomberg. Quick Take.

First, Iran could actually carry out nuclear-related activity that leads to sanctions being imposed. Second, a foreign power could fabricate evidence that makes it appear that Iran has carried out nuclear-related activity. I think the odds of Iran carrying out nuclear-related activity during Rouhani's term are very small (1%), and I think the odds that Rouhani will be re-elected in May 2017 are very good (75%) based on his popular approval, working relationship with Khamenei, and Iran's growing GDP. I think the odds that a principalist will be elected are about 20%, and the odds that such a person would undertake nuclear-related activity in violation of the JCPOA before November 2017 are about 20%. So I calculate the odds for the first route to the outcome as roughly 5%. The second route is trickier. Trump does not seem to care for US intelligence analysis, which suggests that his team will want direct access to unprocessed intelligence. That intelligence could be loaded with false leads from states inimical to Iran, or from Iranian groups in exile that want to overthrow the current regime. I think amateur sleuths tend to weigh evidence on the basis of its emotional impact, so it may not be difficult to convince the Trump administration that Iran is undertaking a secret nuclear program (similar to the way Bush was led to believe Iraq had a WMD program). I put the odds at 80% that Trump will believe Iran is \"up to something nuclear\", and another 70% that Congress will go along with him. In order for sanctions to be effective, Trump would need to convince at least a few other members of the P5+1. China won't go along with it for economic reasons, and I don't think Germany will either as things stand now. Russia won't go along with it because of the post-Arab-Spring political bloc I think they are building in the Middle East, but they would be happy to see us shoot ourselves in the foot economically and strategically, so they won't stop us. That leaves France, where Le Pen might win, and the UK, where Iran is still not very popular. I think the odds of pulling together a coalition of right-leaning nations by November 2017 to impose sanctions are fair, maybe 30%. That makes the odds of the second route completing by November 2017 about 17%. Overall, I put odds of a \"Yes\" outcome by November 2017 at about 22%."], [691, "2016-12-22T16:28:13Z", [0.7], ""], [31644, "2016-12-22T09:37:45Z", [0.45], ""], [23234, "2016-12-22T07:04:13Z", [0.07], "Comment deleted on Dec 22, 2016 07:04AM UTC"], [368, "2016-12-21T21:15:59Z", [0.95], ""], [10720, "2016-12-21T21:06:30Z", [0.2], ""], [691, "2016-12-21T15:55:21Z", [0.72], ""], [691, "2016-12-20T21:19:21Z", [0.72], ""], [368, "2016-12-20T20:41:19Z", [0.95], ""], [30225, "2016-12-20T14:52:53Z", [0.65], ""], [3316, "2016-12-20T10:10:27Z", [0.0], ""], [23861, "2016-12-20T01:42:32Z", [0.55], ""], [1667, "2016-12-20T01:09:47Z", [0.9], ""], [31581, "2016-12-19T23:14:09Z", [0.87], ""], [11885, "2016-12-19T22:20:15Z", [0.7], ""], [13773, "2016-12-19T18:55:09Z", [0.6], ""], [24146, "2016-12-19T04:11:54Z", [0.25], ""], [6303, "2016-12-19T03:32:42Z", [0.16], "According to the general news and GJP consensus.

Trump, therefore, will not impose sanctions because they would almost certainly be ineffective. I don't think that Trump is the type of person who will undertake something strictly for show; if he took any action against Iran, it would have to be seen to be effective, and at this stage only military action will fill the bill. In fact, I expect Iran to test Trump early in his administration, and I expect Trump launch a military strike against Iran. I think Trump would welcome such an incident as an opportunity to restore American credibility, which he - and the Republican Party in general - considers to have been severely compromised by President Obama. I think many Americans would support such a strike, and it might reconcile the neocon wing of the party to Trump. This strike might not be against Iran's nuclear facilities (although it might be). But a single strike against Iran early in Trump's tenure would probably not be the last one, so the nuclear facilities might be destroyed eventually anyway.
