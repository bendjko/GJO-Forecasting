Last July\u2019s U.N.

Looks like I whiffed big time on my first take of this IFP (https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/129767).

The Islamic Republic would also start taking delivery of an advanced Russian S-300 surface-to-air missile defense system in the next two months, Hossein Dehghan added - a system that was blocked before a landmark nuclear deal with world powers. Tehran agreed the deal on curbing its nuclear work in July last year and international sanctions were lifted in January. But tensions with Washington have remained high as Tehran continues to develop its military capabilities. Iran first tested the Emad missile in October. With improved accuracy over its existing arsenal, Iran says the new missile will be an important part of its conventional deterrent. But the United States says the Emad is capable of carrying a nuclear warhead and the test therefore violated a U.N. resolution. Washington imposed fresh sanctions last month against Iranian individuals and businesses linked to the missile program. \"We will unveil the next generation of Emad with improved precision in the next (Iranian) year (starting from March 20),\" Dehghan was quoted as saying by the Fars news agency late on Tuesday. \"The Emad missile is not a violation of the nuclear deal or any U.N. resolution since we will never use a nuclear warhead (on it). It's an allegation,\" he said, adding that mass production would begin in the near future. Iran is also due to start taking delivery of the S-300 missiles system from Russia in the next two months, Dehghan said, and the order would be completed by the end of the year. ~~ Feb 9: \"Iran soon to showcase controversial missile\" --> http://en.trend.az/iran/politics/2492073.html In particular, several Western sources claimed that Tehran violated the UN Security Council\u2019s resolution 2231 by test-firing the Emad, suggesting it is capable of carrying a nuclear warhead. The UNSC resolution 2231, adopted July 20, 2015, endorses the nuclear deal between Tehran and the world powers and calls upon Iran not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles that can deliver nuclear weapons, as well as launching ballistic missiles, such as Emad. ~~~ Jan 31: \"Iran To Go On \u2018Offensive\u2019 In Response To US Missile Sanctions\" --> http://dailycaller.com/2016/01/31/iran-to-go-on-offensive-in-response-to-us-missile-sanctions/ The commander of Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program has responded to new U.S. sanctions against the program by stating that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) response will be \u201coffensive.\u201d \n[...] \nIran\u2019s missile program is controlled by the IRGC, Iran\u2019s vanguard military wing, which takes orders directly from Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Khameini. Iran\u2019s president Rouhani has essentially no control over the organization, which has been actively undermining Rouhani since his election. The group is separate from Iran\u2019s traditional military, and is considered the \u201cideological custodian charged with defending the Islamic Republic against internal and external threats,\u201d according to a backgrounder by the Council on Foreign Relations. The IRGC has its own air force, navy and army and is also in control of the paramilitary Quds force, which engages in covert operations abroad. It is also responsible for coordinating with Iran\u2019s proxy groups abroad, such as Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah. ~~ COMMENT: So, Iran will definitely have another missile launch, it seems like it's a question of when that is. Based on the first link, it looks like it'll be sometime after March 20th, which is still 7 months from Oct 18th.

Remember when it was announced that Cuba was going to be removed from the list? That was in April of last year, but Cuba wasn't *officially* removed from the list for another 45 days. Why? There was 45-day review period where Congress could consider blocking the action with a join resolution. So, even if we allow for the fact that the Obama administration might do something unexpected (like this) [as a quick aside -- let's remember that Obama ordered a review of Cuba in December, so 4 months prior them being taken off the list], but right let's forget both of those things for a moment... this act of removing Iran from this list would still have to get through the GOP Congress -- in an election year! It is at this point that I feel obliged to refer you back to the YouTube video I first referenced at the beginning.  ~~~ COMMENT: Alright -- so we're not having to worry about a 45-day waiting period, but some of the other bits from there apply -- if Congress passes sanctions against Iran, do we really think that Obama would sign them into law? And as for the State Department (or the WH) imposing sanctions unilaterally, there would have to be something going TERRIBLY wrong in Iran for that to happen given the Obama Administration's (likely) desire to continue to sell this plan as a major accomplishment (and it really is, honestly). Having to impose sanctions at the conclusion of Obama's term might sour the legacy, no? Don't get me wrong, I absolutely think that if *they* think it's necessary, they will, but as I said, it's going to have be something that's pretty bad.
