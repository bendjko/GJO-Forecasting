Remarkable are the peaks of the funds rate in the eighties (maximum? When?) and the extreme minimums around 2010 (minimum? When?). As becomes clear from the graph the development of the federal funds rate is divided in increasing and decreasing trends, the trends lasts for several months and sometimes years. This implies that if the effective federal funds rate has risen in the previous month, the probability of an increase in the rate in the next month is higher than the chance of a decrease. \nTherefore it becomes useful to look at the most recent trend. Figure 2 shows clearly a gradually increasing trend in the effective federal funds rate. This increase started in November 2015, with a rate just above 0.1% and is was between 0,6% and 0,7% in the most recent data. The trend does not seem to have reached it\u2019s peak yet, since it is still gradually increasing until January 2017.\nHowever, the question is not about the effective federal funds rate, but about the targeted federal fund rate by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The decision to use the data of the effective federal funds rate can be justified by showing that the effective federal funds rate usually follow the targeted federal funds rate. If one compares figure 2 & 3, it becomes clear that when the FOMC decided to raise the limit if of the target rate from 0,25% to 0,5% in January 2016, the effective rate increased quickly to a rate just below 0.4% and continued to increase slowly after that time. A similar development is shown when the FOMC raised the limit of the target rate to 0,75% in the end of 2016. Thus, these two figures highly correlate with each other and therefore the effective federal funds rate can be used as an indicator of the targeted federal funds rate by the FOMC. One of the main goals of the Federal reserves is to keep the inflation around 2% (Svensson, 1997, p.1112). Because of the economic crisis the inflation rate was below 2% for a very long time, and therefore the FOMC kept the federal funds rate as low as possible, between 0% and 0,25%. When the interest rates are lowered, LM shifts down leading to a higher output and price level.Yet the inflation is increasing again since the end of 2015 (figure 4) and the FOMC started in begin 2016 to slowly raise the interest to adjust to the rising inflation rate again. Now, the inflation is past the target of approximately 2%, therefore it is likely that the FOMC will execute contractionary monetary policy, increasing the federal funds rate, to shift LM up leading to a relatively lower output and price level. In this way the FOMC can reduce the inflation rate again to the targeted range around 2%.\nThe second main goal of the FED is to keep unemployment at its natural level. It can be argued that the natural level is around 5%  or even higher (Daly, Hobijn, Sahin & Valletta, 2012, p.5). Figure 5 shows that the unemployment rate has been decreasing since 2010, and recently dropped below 5% (January 2016). Because of the economic crisis unemployment was above the natural rate of unemployment, but because of the very low interest rates and the growing economy it started to drop again. However, in January 2016 unemployment reached the 5% level and dropped below 5%, this correlates with the moment that the FOMC decided to raise the federal funds rate again. The graph shows that unemployment is still below 5% and therefore the FOMC is, again, likely to raise the federal funds rate. In this case LM will shift down, leading to a decrease in investment and in output. Okun\u2019s law states that unemployment then will grow (Blanchard and Johnson, 2013, p. 52).\nIn conclusion, the FOMC is very likely to raise the federal funds rate for the following reasons. Firstly, the federal funds rate is in an increasing trend and is therefore more likely to be raised than lowered. Furthermore, the main indicators of the federal funds rate, the inflation and the unemployment, are not at their target rate, yet this can be reached by the FOMC if they raise the federal funds rate. Therefore my forecast is that the probability of the FOMC raising the federal funds rate is 80% and the probability of them mainting the rate is 20%.\nReferences:\nBlanchard, O. and Johnson, D. R.

Instead, we think March would be a good meeting for them to prepare the markets for a hike at the subsequent meeting on May third,\" the economists wrote. Most Fed watchers have forecast a June rate hike. Goldman Sachs economists also said that based mostly on the hotter inflation reading, the likelihood of a March hike increased to 30 percent from 20 percent, but they also see a better chance for May. \"In short, we now think it is a close call whether the committee will hike the funds rate at the next two meetings or wait until June, and we see very high odds [90 percent] of at least one rate increase by mid-year,\" they wrote in a note.
