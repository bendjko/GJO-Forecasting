Yet, there may be another factor that could bring down oil prices as soon as next year\u2026 China. China has been building a strategic crude oil reserve for the last decade, but the size of that reserve remains undisclosed, with analysts making estimates based on China-bound cargoes and satellite imaging. Last year, a Silicone Valley tech company, Orbital Insight, suggested that China may have stored as much as 600 million barrels of crude by May. This was the highest reserve estimate at the time. Since then, the reserve has in all likelihood grown, possibly exceeding the U.S. SPR, which stood at 678.9 million barrels as of August 18th this year. This year, Chinese crude imports have run at record-breaking rates, with the average daily on par with what the U.S. imports, at about 8 million barrels, the Financial Times notes in an analysis. A lot of these, however, are going into storage tanks, analysts believe, and they warn that soon the tanks may fill up, wreaking havoc on prices and--more notably--on OPEC. The cartel, Russia and 11 other producers agreed last year to remove 1.8 million bpd from global oil supply in an attempt to raise prices above US$50, with hopes for at least $60. This May, they agreed to extend the cuts to March 2018. Nevertheless, prices have remained largely stable around the $50 mark because of rising U.S. output, which last week jumped above 9.5 million bpd, according to the EIA (para 1-5). Slav, I. (2017).

The brimming oil inventories that have pressured prices for three years had started to decline in recent weeks as U.S. demand rose and OPEC production was reduced. But some analysts say this decline in stockpiles could reverse later in the year as U.S. crude production continues to grow. A poll of 15 investment banks, surveyed by The Wall Street Journal at the end of July, predicted that Brent crude, the international benchmark, will average $53 a barrel this year, down $2 from the June survey. The banks expect West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. oil gauge, to average $51 a barrel this year, down a dollar from the previous survey. Banks in the survey have also downgraded their expectations for next year, predicting Brent crude will average $55 a barrel, down $2 from the June poll. The banks expect WTI to average $53 a barrel in 2018, also down $2 (para 1-4). However, stock levels around the world continue to be above historical averages, as the world struggles to drain the crude glut that has pressured prices since 2014. That\u2019s in part due to the increasing flow of oil from U.S. fields (para 11). U.S. oil production last week rose by 20,000 barrels a day, the EIA data showed. Meanwhile, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which last year clinched a deal to limit its output, has seen some of its members produce above the agreed-upon levels as they make up for budget shortfalls (para. 11-12).

Why? Its members are addicted to oil. Eight months after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries announced a plan for its 14 members and 10 allied countries to withhold almost 2% of the world\u2019s oil every day to boost prices, seven of the 11 OPEC members that pledged to cut appear to be producing more oil than promised. Crude prices have actually fallen, by 7.6% to $52.52 a barrel, since the beginning of the year\u2014half what the cartel called a fair price just three years ago and a level that some say is here for the long term. Previously, low production costs meant OPEC members profited even when oil prices fell. These days, members have ramped up government spending to keep populations happy and cover military expenses, and don\u2019t have a cushion to let oil revenues slip. Their strained budgets can be covered only through increasingly high prices per barrel, and if prices are low they need to produce more (para 1-5). The output has stolen market share from the cartel\u2019s members and pushed prices lower. OPEC\u2019s share of the global oil market has shrunk to 40% today from 55% in the early 1970s, when its embargo on sales to the West quadrupled oil prices in six months (para 13). The dynamic working against OPEC is that, collectively, its members need the highest oil prices of any industry player\u2014more than companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp. , Royal Dutch Shell PLC and most U.S. shale producers, according to Goldman Sachs . For decades, OPEC was the low-cost producer of oil. During the boom years of 2011 through 2014, OPEC members, which largely fund national spending with oil revenue, could balance their budgets with oil prices $10 to $40 a barrel less than most oil companies needed to fund their spending and pay dividends. Today, OPEC needs $10 to $20 a barrel more than Big Oil and U.S. exploration and production outfits, the investment bank said in a report to clients (para. 13- 15).

Last year, the U.S. became the world's top net exporter of fuel, an outgrowth of booming domestic production since the shale oil revolution started in 2010. That's a fundamental shift from the traditional U.S. role in global markets as a top importer and consumer. Net exports are on track to hit another record in 2017, making foreign fuel markets increasingly important for the future growth prospects and profit margins of U.S. refiners. Shale oil producers have provided refiners with abundant and cheap domestic crude supplies, giving them the raw material they need to produce internationally competitive fuel. The nation set a record in 2016 by sending a net 2.5 million barrels per day (bpd) of petroleum products to foreign markets. That compares to net fuel imports of 2.3 million just a decade ago, according to U.S. government data (para 1-5). Latin American Buyers U.S. refined products are filling shortages in countries such as Mexico and Venezuela, where refineries have been running below capacity. U.S. exports have also made inroads into Brazil's market by undercutting the price of locally produced fuel (para. 16). In recession-scarred Venezuela, the country's largest refining complex has lowered operating rates this month to less than half of its 955,000-barrel-per-day capacity, a level that has required state-run oil company PDVSA to import more fuel to meet domestic demand (para. 19). Between them, Mexico and Venezuela have recently said they want to buy extra volumes of almost 19 million barrels in the second half of the year - mostly from the United States - an amount suggesting that U.S. exports will grow again this year over last year's record levels (para. 19-20).

The world\u2019s largest drillers failed to take advantage of high prices during the boom years before 2014 to repay debt, according to the report published on Tuesday. Instead they embarked on costly investments in new projects and dividends, leaving them unprepared for the painful downturn that ensued. Now, a weak recovery in oil prices is making it harder to reduce the debt accumulated in recent years. Exxon last year lost the platinum credit rating it held since the Great Depression, and all of its largest rivals, including Total SA, BP Plc, and Royal Dutch Shell Plc also faced similar reductions. Further downgrades could become more likely later this year or in 2018 if oil prices remain below $50 a barrel, the report said (para. 1-3). Get-Out-of-Jail \"The modest improvement in oil prices this year reflects the support from the OPEC and Russian agreement to constrain production,\" Simon Redmond, director of corporate ratings for commodities at S&P, wrote in the report. \"But it hardly offers a get-out-of-jail-free card for ratings\" (para. 6). S&P warned Exxon seven weeks ago that the explorer\u2019s balance sheet was under strain, degrading the oil producer\u2019s outlook to negative. The rating company said it worried Exxon may \u201cprioritize capital spending, acquisitions or shareholder returns over debt reduction.\u201d Total, Exxon, and Chevron face the greatest danger of a ratings cut, given their elevated debt loads and lackluster efforts to curtail investments and dividend payouts. An exception to the trend is Shell, the only company among the five to receive a positive outlook from S&P. Shell outperformed its peers last year, putting it in a better position than its rivals to cut costs as prices remain low. An agreement by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut production is proving unable so far to significantly raise prices and diminish a global supply glut. Oil companies may choose to prioritize debt reduction by selling off assets and winding down long-term investments, Harvey said. Alternatively, they could seek more acquisitions to lock in profitability at lower prices, such as BP investing in fields in continental Africa (para. 6-9). Tognini, G. (2017).

Crude ended the quarter 9% lower, and sank as much as 21.9% in June from highs in February. A loss of 20% or more typically signals the start of a bear market. It is a sharp shift from the first months of 2017, when investors had been divided over whether members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would stick to pledges to cut output, but generally believed those cuts would help ease the global supply glut and lift prices. For a time, it seemed almost nothing could shake oil investors out of their malaise. Prices fell even after OPEC announced it would extend its cuts into next year and the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that U.S. stockpiles fell nearly every week during the quarter. At the same time, U.S. output has risen more quickly than many predicted: The EIA is now forecasting that it will average a record of 10 million barrels a day next year. Output from Libya and Nigeria, OPEC members exempt from the production-cut agreements, has ramped up as well (para. 1-6). Saudi Arabia, OPEC\u2019s de facto leader, has a lot riding on higher oil prices. The country is targeting oil prices of $60 a barrel to smooth the way for the initial public offering of Saudi Aramco, its national oil company. That is one reason some investors still hope that OPEC will make deeper cuts (para. 13). Citigroup is among the firms that believe the market is actually getting tighter, but the firm\u2019s analysts say for now, negative sentiment could be hard to shake. Citi analysts say the chances that Brent crude futures will climb to $60 by the end of the year are less than 50%, down from their previous estimate of a 65% chance. Brent settled at $47.92 Friday. \u201cThe fund community has been burned so badly as to reduce the likelihood of them jumping back in no matter what the fundamentals,\u201d the analysts wrote in a June 26 research note.

It shows little understanding of where it is, how it got there or where it's going. While it still manages to collect new members here and there, its core group looks more fragile than at any point in nearly 30 years. The historic output agreements, put together so painstakingly last year, are failing. Nearly 12 months of shuttle diplomacy culminated in two deals that would see 22 countries cut production by nearly 1.8 million barrels a day. Implementation has been better than for any previous output cut, with compliance put at 106 percent in May. A resounding success? Hardly. We're now in the final month of those deals and oil prices are lower than when they were agreed. Not only have producers sacrificed volume, but they earn less for each barrel they do produce. Nothing Gained \nCrude has fallen back below levels last seen before OPEC's November output deal The recent extension of the deals just leaves output restraint in place for another nine months, the best response OPEC could muster. Deeper cuts were barely mentioned. Assertions to do \"whatever it takes\" ring hollow. Indeed, there's no appetite for the big cuts that would demand real sacrifices in countries such as Russia, where normal seasonal factors helped it lower production in the first half of the year. Just sticking to current output levels could be difficult for the rest of 2017: early maintenance work has helped several OPEC members meet their targets but that can't continue. Then there's the problem of recovering output from Libya and Nigeria, both exempt from the cuts. The malaise runs much deeper, though. Beneath a veneer of unity, rifts are developing among core Middle East members. The Saudi-led confrontation with Qatar could create the most serious split since Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. As I wrote last week, Iraq might be in Mohammed bin Salman's sights next, as Iran's influence there grows and Baghdad lags the rest in implementing output cuts. As if the internal failings weren't enough, OPEC seems to have lost touch with reality. Ministers say higher prices are needed to pay for investment in future production capacity, issuing dire warnings of a future supply crunch. They said the same thing to justify prices soaring above $100 a barrel in 2008. It wasn't true then, and it may not be true now. The oil industry has responded to the price slump by slashing costs. Projects that needed $100 crude to break even have magically been redesigned to be profitable at half that level. OPEC has completely misjudged the North American shale industry and seems not to understand how it is still evolving rapidly. It's a little like trying to explain the internet to my 85-year-old mother, or my 12-year-old daughter trying to explain social media to me. As consultant Morten Frisch tells me, drilling horizontal sidetracks from abandoned wells in the Permian Basin is yielding a 91 percent internal rate of return on a $7 million investment and delivering 1,500 barrels a day of crude. He predicts large production increases from vertical wells in previously produced areas in the Permian (para. 1-9). Lee, J. (2017). OPEC Looks Totally Bewildered by the Oil Market. Bloomberg.

Analysts said oil prices extended gains as investors covered short positions, but there was little fundamental news supporting prices. \"It is just the fact that the oil market stopped falling... I suspect short covering,\" said Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney. \"And a slight support from a weak U.S. dollar.\" The U.S. dollar index stayed low on Monday against a basket of currencies amid fading expectations for the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates again later this year. A weaker dollar also makes oil cheaper for countries using other currencies. \"Commodities stabilized after a turbulent week where most sectors suffered large falls,\" ANZ bank said in a note. \"A slightly weaker U.S. dollar also helped improve investor appetite.\" Although oil prices have bounced back from 10-month lows, they are still down about 13 percent since late May, when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some other producers agreed to extend a deal to reduce output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until the end of next March.

Mohammed bin Salman, elevated to crown prince of Saudi Arabia this week, needs oil prices to rise from current levels of $45 a barrel to carry out plans to kick-start the kingdom\u2019s economy, largely through a partial public listing of its state oil company, known as Saudi Aramco. The Saudis are targeting $60 a barrel to help the initial public offering generate tens of billions of dollars, which would be plowed into developing new technology and industrial sectors in Saudi Arabia. Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries have held informal talks in recent days about how to halt a nearly month-long skid in oil prices, which have fallen more than 16% since late May. OPEC, along with big producers like Russia that aren\u2019t members of the 14-nation cartel, is already withholding almost 2% of the world\u2019s oil supply, but some OPEC members say more needs to be done to bring production in line with demand. Prince Mohammed is known for taking aggressive action on several fronts, prosecuting a war in Yemen, leading the diplomatic freeze against Qatar, and green-lighting Saudi participation in OPEC\u2019s production cuts. But the Saudis have less leverage over other OPEC members because of the Aramco IPO, said Jim Krane, a fellow who studies Middle East energy and geopolitical issues at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute. Other OPEC members are unlikely to slash production further unless they see Saudi Arabia taking on a large share of the burden, because any new cuts would be seen as a push to support the Aramco IPO (para. 1-5). Saudi Arabia has time to wait for oil prices to rise, with the IPO not scheduled until 2018. Publicly, Saudi Arabia, its allies and OPEC are preaching patience (para. 10).

The United Arab Emirates\u2019 oil minister, Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazrouei, said OPEC wasn\u2019t planning any new action soon Privately, OPEC members\u2019 worries are centered on two members who were exempted from the obligation to cut output: Libya and Nigeria. Both had their oil industries disrupted by civil strife, but their production has come roaring back in recent months.

Their confidence held up for the first months of 2017, when oil was comfortably ensconced in a range between $50 a barrel and $55.

But what if they\u2019re wrong? There\u2019s a host of reasons to think they might be. Here\u2019s what happens when you test their central assumptions. The International Energy Agency sees oil demand rising more than 10 percent, to 103.5 million barrels a day by 2040, while companies predict even faster growth. But forecasters don\u2019t always anticipate seismic shifts in technology and policy that could slow demand growth, or even eliminate it altogether in some parts of the economy. Even small changes could add up. Advances in vehicle efficiency, a rise in electric cars, tighter emissions standards and shifts to other fuel sources would result in oil demand much lower than the industry is banking on. \u201cWe cannot even begin to comprehend the transformation in the mobility arena that is coming at us,\u201d Jules Kortenhorst, chief executive officer of the Rocky Mountain Institute, based in Boulder, Colorado, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question if it will come, it\u2019s only a question of what the timing of the arrival will be.\u201d Technological Change About 60 percent of oil is used in transportation, which is also where the biggest technological changes are emerging. All over the world, governments concerned about climate change or air pollution are pushing tighter fuel-efficiency standards, or creating low-emission zones for cars and even ships. The exposure of cheating on diesel-emissions test by Volkswagen AG, and similar accusations against other automakers has added to the pressure on regulators to toughen standards. The proliferation of big data analysis is set to dramatically curb fuel waste, according to the Rocky Mountain Institute. Aircraft being produced today by companies like General Electric Co. can already detect small changes in engine performance, meaning engineers can be sent out to fix any issues and keep them operating at peak efficiency. Smarter navigation technologies allow truck drivers to reduce the distances they travel, while improvements to aerodynamics will enable vehicles to travel farther on less fuel. These and many other technologies would reduce emissions, while also save money, especially in a world where the International Energy Agency sees oil prices rising from about $50 a barrel now to $80 at the end of the decade, and to above $100 by 2030 (para. 1-8).

Lilis aims to expand production sevenfold this year in America's most active oilfield. The whir of activity is all the more impressive after the small firm nearly collapsed in late 2015 - amid unrestrained production from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). As per-barrel prices plummeted, Lilis piled on debt and struggled to pay workers. Now - with prices higher after a November OPEC decision to cut output - Lilis can't grow fast enough. Such resurrections are common these days in the Permian, which stretches across West Texas and eastern New Mexico. They tell the story of the U.S. shale resurgence and the quandary it poses for OPEC as it struggles to tame a global glut. Surging U.S. production has stalled OPEC's effort to cut supply. Inventories in industrialized nations totaled 3.05 billion barrels in February - about 330 million barrels above the five-year average, according to the International Energy Agency. The Permian boom will be high on the agenda as OPEC oil ministers begin gathering in Vienna ahead of a May 25 policy meeting to decide whether to extend output cuts. In the long term, too much U.S. output could spur OPEC to open the spigots again - setting off another price war - but for now its member nations' need for revenue makes that unlikely. On Monday, the world's top two oil producers - OPEC heavyweight Saudi Arabia and Russia, a non-OPEC nation - said they had agreed in principle on the need to continue output cuts for an additional nine months, through March 2018. That would extend the initial agreement, which took effect in January and reduced production by 1.2 barrels per day (bpd) from OPEC nations and another 600,000 bpd from non-OPEC producers, including Russia. The pledge to extend cuts marked an evolution in the thinking of Saudi Arabia Oil Minister Khalid al-Falih - in response to surging U.S. output. After OPEC's decision in November, Al-Falih expressed confidence that no further supply curbs would be needed because of rising demand. Then in March, Al-Falih told a Houston energy conference that the \"green shoots\" in U.S. shale might be \"growing too fast\" - and warned there would be no \"free rides\" for U.S. producers benefiting from OPEC production cuts. But by last week, Al-Falih vowed OPEC would do \"whatever it takes\" to control oversupply (para. 1-14). Scheyder, E. (2017). In America's largest oilfield, whir of activity confounds OPEC. Reuters.

Brent crude was down 20 cents, or 0.4 percent, from the last close at $51.45 per barrel at 0647 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was at $48.39, down 27 cents, or 0.6 percent. U.S. crude inventories rose by 882,000 barrels in the week ending May 12 to 523.4 million, data from the American Petroleum Institute (API) showed on Tuesday. Brent reached $52.63 a barrel on Monday and WTI rose as high as $49.66 a barrel after Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed on the need for a, 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) crude supply cut by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some other producers to be extended until the end of March 2018. Official U.S. storage data will be released by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) later on Wednesday. \"The vulnerability of OPEC's ... rhetoric was starkly revealed ... as the U.S. API crude inventories showed an unexpected increase,\" said Jeffrey Halley of futures brokerage OANDA. There are also rising amounts of tankers storing oil offshore China as facilities on land are full. The extension of the supply cuts, which started in January and were supposed to end in June, is seen as necessary by some as they have not so far significantly tightened the market or propped up prices. The International Energy Agency said on Tuesday that commercial oil inventories in industrialized countries rose by 24.1 million barrels in the first quarter of 2016, despite the cuts. \"The agreement by OPEC to extend cuts into 2018 is critical,\" said AB Bernstein in a note. Adding to ongoing oversupply concerns, North Sea oil production, generally seen in terminal decline, is expected to jump by a net 400,000 bpd, a fifth of total output, in the next two years as producers improve efficiency. This adds to a 10 percent jump in U.S. production since mid-2016 to 9.3 million bpd, not far off top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia (para. 1-13). Gloystein, H. (2017).

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), of which Saudi Arabia is the de-facto leader, and other producers led by Russia, pledged late last year to cut output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) during the first half of 2017. 1.2 million bpd of the supply cut is to come from OPEC-members. The extension of the cut into the first quarter of next year will initially be on the same volume terms as before, although the ministers said they hoped other producers would join the efforts.

Flush with cash from a short-lived OPEC-led crude rally, North American drillers plan to lift their 2017 outlays by 32 percent to $84 billion, compared with just 3 percent for international projects, according to analysts at Barclays Plc. Much of the increase in spending is flowing into the Permian Basin, a sprawling, mile-thick accumulation of crude beneath Texas and New Mexico, where producers have been reaping double-digit returns even with oil commanding less than half what it did in 2014. That\u2019s bad news for OPEC and its partners in a global campaign to crimp supplies and elevate prices. Wood Mackenzie Ltd. estimates that new spending will add 800,000 barrels of North American crude this year, equivalent to 44 percent of the reductions announced by the Saudi- and Russia-led group. \u201cThe specter of American supply is real,\u201d Roy Martin, a Wood Mackenzie research analyst in Houston, said in a telephone interview. \u201cThe level of capital budget increases really surprised us.\u201d Drilling budgets around the world collapsed in 2016 as the worst crude market collapse in a generation erased cash flows, forcing explorers to cancel expansion projects, cut jobs and sell oil and natural gas fields to raise cash. The pain also swept across the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which in November relented by agreeing with several non-OPEC nations to curb output by 1.8 million barrels a day. Oil prices that initially popped above $55 in the weeks after the cut was announced have since dipped to around $46, reflecting pessimism that the OPEC-led deal can withstand the onslaught of U.S. shale. \nSo far, independent American explorers such as EOG Resources Inc. and Pioneer Natural Resources Co. are holding fast to their ambitious growth plans. Some recently finished wells in the Permian region yielded 70 percent returns at first-quarter prices, EOG Chief Executive Officer Bill Thomas told investors and analysts during a conference call on Tuesday. EOG, the second-largest U.S. explorer that doesn\u2019t own refineries, plans to boost spending by 44 percent this year to between $3.7 billion and $4.1 billion. Pioneer is eyeing a 33 percent increase to $2.8 billion. The sub-group that includes North American shale drillers like EOG and Pioneer is collectively targeting $53 billion in spending this year, up from $35 billion in 2016, according to the Barclays analysts led by J. David Anderson. U.S. oil production is already swelling, even though output from the new wells being drilled won\u2019t materialize above ground for months. The Energy Department\u2019s statistics arm raised its full-year 2017 supply estimate to 9.31 million barrels a day on Tuesday, a 1 percent increase from the April forecast (para. 1-11). Carroll, J.

The world\u2019s biggest independent oil trader says their efforts could be in vain. Demand isn\u2019t expanding as much as expected, and U.S. shale output is growing faster than forecast, according to Vitol Group. That\u2019s increasing the burden on the world\u2019s biggest producers, who need to stick to their pledges to cut supply just to keep prices from falling, said Kho Hui Meng, the head of the company\u2019s Asian arm. Oil has given up all its gains since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers signed a deal late last year to limit supply for six months from January. Prices have been hit by surging output in the U.S., which is not part of the agreement. Any recovery in crude will depend on sustained usage by nations such as China, India and the U.S. as much as OPEC\u2019s efforts to control supply. \u201cWhat we need is real demand growth, faster demand growth,\u201d Kho, the president of Vitol Asia Pte., said in an interview in Kuala Lumpur. \u201cGrowth is there, but not fast enough.\u201d While consumption was forecast to expand this year by about 1.3 million barrels a day, growth has been limited to about 800,000 barrels a day so far in 2017, he said, adding that U.S. output had grown 400,000-500,000 barrels a day more than expected. \u201cIf demand goes back to where it should, where it\u2019s forecast, then it\u2019ll help, but my gut feel tells me it is still a bit long,\u201d he said. The International Energy Agency has trimmed its forecasts for global oil demand growth this year by about 100,000 barrels a day to 1.3 million a day as a result of weaker consumption in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development member countries and an abrupt slowdown in economic activity in India and Russia, according to a report last month. The Paris-based IEA cut its estimate for India\u2019s 2017 oil-demand growth by 11 percent. There\u2019s also concern that consumption may slow in China, the world\u2019s second-biggest oil user. Independent refiners, which account for about a third of the nation\u2019s capacity, have received lower crude import quotas compared with a year earlier, prompting speculation their purchases could slow. \u201cThe oil market is looking for growth but there\u2019s no growth,\u201d Vitol\u2019s Kho said, adding that the refiners may only get approval for the same volume of imports as last year. And while U.S. gasoline consumption is expected to hit its seasonal summer peak soon, demand growth \u201cis not there yet,\u201d he said. \nThe world\u2019s biggest crude exporter is nevertheless bullish. Saudi Arabia expects 2017 global consumption to grow at a rate close to that of 2016, Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said on Monday. \u201cWe look for China\u2019s oil demand growth to match last year\u2019s, on the back of a robust transport sector, while India\u2019s anticipated annual economic growth of more than seven percent will continue to drive healthy growth,\u201d he said in Kuala Lumpur. While some fear a slowdown in Chinese oil demand, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. doesn\u2019t see any cause for concern. Growth in the nation\u2019s car fleet will support gasoline demand, with increasing truck sales and air travel also helping fuel consumption, it said in a report dated May 9 (para. 1-10).

But now, the government is offering international oil companies their biggest role since 1979, when the newly-founded Islamic Republic nationalized the country\u2019s reserves. In theory, it\u2019s an attractive proposition for both sides. Iran needs oil revenue to revive its economy, the third-largest in the Middle East, which was set back by years of sanctions. Foreign companies are tempted by the potential profits that could be made even without a rebound in the price of oil. But there are plenty of risks to investing in Iran. Among them: that the U.S. will impose new sanctions on the country under President Donald Trump, who opposes the 2015 deal that allowed Iran to reintegrate into the world economy, and that May elections in Iran will produce a leader less welcoming to foreign investment. The Situation Iran\u2019s oil output has settled just below its pre-sanction level, following the lifting of most measures in January 2016 after Iran reined in its nuclear program under its agreement with world powers. In a November deal among members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut output, Iran was granted an exemption allowing it to raise production further. Expanding development of its oil fields will require outside technology, management expertise and capital, so the government has called on foreign companies to invest $100 billion in the oil industry. One obstacle has been the relatively poor contract terms Iran provided in the past. Iran\u2019s cabinet approved a new model contract in August but only after Iranian conservatives, who oppose President Hassan Rouhani\u2019s efforts to bring foreign investment into Iran, forced the government to make amendments. Details, such as how investors will be regulated and how disputes will be resolved, were not made public. In November, France\u2019s Total reached a non-binding agreement to develop a natural gas field in Iran, and the next month Royal Dutch Shell signed a deal to assess three of the country\u2019s largest oil and gas fields. The Background From the first concession given to a British speculator in 1901 until the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran had almost no control over its most precious natural resource. For several decades the British government, through its majority stake in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, effectively owned Iran\u2019s oil and received the lion\u2019s share of the profits. After years of mounting discontent, Iran\u2019s parliament nationalized the country\u2019s oil fields in 1951. The politician who spearheaded the takeover, Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh, was deposed in a coup backed by British and U.S. intelligence services two years later, and the power of the Western-backed Shah was restored. When Islamic revolutionaries overthrew the Shah in 1979, one of their first acts was to renationalize Iran\u2019s oil. For two decades, no foreign oil companies operated in Iran. When they came back in the late 1990s they operated under short-term contracts that paid them a fixed fee to explore for oil and develop fields, with all the risks that entailed, but they got no share of production profits. Most of those companies stopped operating in Iran by 2010, as political risks started to outweigh the benefits. The Argument Can Iran attract the top technology, hefty investments and long-term commitments it seeks? Big oil companies won\u2019t pass up Iran\u2019s fields lightly. The country\u2019s crude is cheap to extract: Costs are less than half those in Mexico, for instance. And Iran holds about 10 percent of the world\u2019s proven reserves. But the list of risks is long. Business regulations in Iran are complex. Investors will have to enter a joint venture with a local partner, making it harder to comply with international anti-corruption legislation and the remaining U.S. sanctions. The government hasn\u2019t clarified whether it will agree to settle disputes through tribunals such as the International Court of Arbitration. Longer-term contracts will offer more opportunity to exploit difficult fields but will also lock investors into an unpredictable environment. Conservative cleric Ebrahim Raisi could unseat Rouhani in elections in May, and would likely be less receptive to investors. Trump has argued that the nuclear deal is unacceptably favorable to Iran. Under his presidency, the U.S. could impose new sanctions on Iran or tighten existing ones (para. 1-4). Wilkin, S. (2017). Iran\u2019s Oil. Bloomberg. Quick Take.

Under Rouhani's tenure, Iran brought renewed investment interest to a country that saw sanctions pressures ease as a result of a U.N.-backed multilateral nuclear agreement. In November, the country, a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, became the only party to an effort to balance an over-supplied crude oil market that's allowed to produce more oil in order to regain a market share lost to those sanctions. Ali Khamenei, the conservative ruling cleric in Iran, has called for a so-called resistance economy, one that limits exposure to international market shocks and sanctions pressures in part by weaning itself off oil for revenue.

He made the statement on the sidelines of the 13th Iran Petrochemical Forum which brought together representatives from 76 international and 385 domestic firms for two days in Tehran. In response to speculations that the Trump administration\u2019s hawkish stance toward Tehran has discouraged foreign investors, Zamaninia said, \"International majors' lack of trust and their reluctance to invest in Iran's economy and energy sectors will not last long. We have held extensive negotiations with multinationals and the talks will gain momentum in the coming days.\" Downplaying the possibility of a 'snap back' of trade and economic restrictions, the official reiterated that possible new sanctions by the United States against Iran cannot and will not apply to agreements undertaken prior to the new sanctions. \"There is nothing to worry about. In case of new economic restrictions (and any impediment in cooperation), foreign contractors will be remunerated based on the terms and agreements of their deals,\" Zamaninia said. The snap back mechanism allows previously lifted sanctions to be quickly reinstated if signatories of the nuclear deal find Tehran's activities in violation of the agreement (para. 1-7).

By lifting restraints on output, Saudi Arabia would stop subsidizing high-cost oil producers and halt the rapid rise in U.S. production that was eating into OPEC's market share. At least, that was the logic back in November 2014.But things haven't gone according to plan. OPEC's four-month experiment with production curbs has failed. More worryingly, the strength of shale's rebound suggests that OPEC faces a long-term struggle against this new source of supply in an industry where technological advances are the norm and today's niche play becomes the next decade's global standard. Even when the group restored production curbs last year, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said he didn\u2019t expect a big supply response from American shale producers in 2017. In fact, it turns out that response had already begun, and it is much stronger than anyone had expected. Production Rebound U.S. oil output could pass its 2015 peak as early as July if recent growth continues\nTotal U.S. crude production has risen by more than 550,000 barrels a day in the 20 weeks since OPEC decided to cut output, according to weekly Department of Energy data. Much of that increase has come from shale formations. If this rate of growth -- a little under 30,000 barrels a day of new supply each week -- continues, U.S. output could top its recent peak of 9.61 million barrels a day shortly after OPEC meets on May 25 to consider its next move. That is bad enough for OPEC producers, but the picture just gets worse for them each month. The DoE publishes a monthly outlook and its views on domestic production are evolving rapidly -- and not in a way that suits OPEC.Its latest forecast, published on April 11, pegs U.S. oil production at 9.24 million barrels a day by July. That is half a million barrels a day higher than it was forecasting for that month in November 2016, just before OPEC decided to restore output restraint. Its outlook for December 2017 has increased by 700,000 barrels a day over the same period (para. 1-2). Lee, J. (2017). Shale's the Wild Horse OPEC Can't Tame. Bloomberg.

Alkhalisi (2017) April 20, states that: America is turning up the heat on Iran. A day after ordering a review into whether lifting sanctions on Iran was good for U.S. national security, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson accused the Islamic republic of \"alarming and ongoing provocations\" and said it \"has the potential to travel the same path as North Korea\" if unchecked. Under a deal signed in 2015, Western powers agreed to lift some economic sanctions in return for Iran agreeing to rein in its nuclear program. Analysts say the Trump administration is now dropping hints that it will re-impose sanctions unless Tehran stops what the U.S. says is destabilizing behavior in the Middle East. \"Tillerson may be suggesting that the U.S. can leverage renewal of nuclear related sanctions easing under the nuclear deal for a change in Iranian regional behavior,\" said Ellie Geranmayeh, policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. So who loses out if Trump does decide to abandon the nuclear deal? Iran's economy Iran has the fourth largest crude reserves in the world and also claims nearly one-fifth of the planet's natural gas. Oil is a vital part of the economy. The country has ramped up production since sanctions were eased to about 3.8 million barrels a day. That's about a million barrels a day more than in 2015. Iran's big return to global markets complicated attempts by OPEC producers and others to reduce a supply glut that had sent prices crashing. Tehran insisted on keeping its production near four million barrels a day, in line with the amount it was pumping before sanctions were imposed.

Vilified in the West for his barbs against America and Israel and questioning of the Holocaust, the blacksmith's son Ahmadinejad has upset predictions before by stealing the show in 2005 when he defeated powerful former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani in a run-off vote. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei revealed last year that he had recommended to Ahmadinejad not to enter the contest. But after his registration on Wednesday, Ahmadinejad told journalists that Khamenei's recommendation was \"just advice\", Iranian media reported. Khamenei praised Ahmadinejad as \"courageous, wise and hard-working\" after his re-election in 2009, which ignited an eight-month firestorm of street protests. His pro-reform rivals said that vote was rigged. But throughout Ahmadinejad's presidency, Khamenei was wary of him, and his insubordination and relentless self-aggrandizement rankled the hardline clergy.

When the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets in May to decide on an extension of its production deal, the cartel will face a delicate balance: If it continues to limit output and prices rise too fast, U.S. shale drillers would ramp up production. If OPEC scraps the deal, it risks refueling the global crude glut. OPEC\u2019s decision has major implications for oil prices. A poll of 14 investment banks, surveyed by The Wall Street Journal in late March, predicted that Brent crude, the international oil-price benchmark, will average $57 a barrel this year, unchanged from the previous survey. The banks expect West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. oil gauge, to average $55 a barrel this year. On Wednesday, Brent settled at $54.36 a barrel while WTI settled at $51.15 a barrel. Oil prices have risen by close to a fifth since OPEC and other major producers decided late last year to cut around 2% from global production in the first half of this year. On May 25, OPEC ministers will meet in Vienna to decide whether to extend that deal for six months. It isn\u2019t an easy call, analysts say. \u201cOPEC does not want to cut production too much and push up prices too fast. The risk is that U.S. shale output grows even more quickly than forecast,\u201d said Michael Wittner, head of oil-market research at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale . But while the resurgence of U.S. drillers means OPEC could lose market share by limiting its output for longer, the group\u2019s efforts are yet to bear fruit. OPEC\u2019s goal in agreeing to cut production, along with several major producers outside the cartel, was to see global crude stockpiles fall after nearly three years of market oversupply. But U.S. inventories, seen as a bellwether for global stockpiles, have recently reached an all-time high, which caused prices to fall below $50 a barrel last month. \u201cThe original objective of the production cuts\u2026will apparently not be achieved by [May],\u201d say analysts at Commerzbank. \u201cThe targeted inventory reduction will only materialize if OPEC output is maintained at its present level right into the fourth quarter\u201d (para. 1-10).

Thus, we may assume for this prediction that Iran is continuously seeking to increase its total revenue, to secure itself as a socially, politically and militarily powerful international actor. The first graph indicates that Iran\u2019s main source of revenue is oil with only 11 percent of its GDP being obtained otherwise (fig. 1). Additionally, to further understand the importance of oil to the economy of Iran, recent studies have shown that since the lifting of the P5 imposed sanctions on Iran in 2016 - initially imposed due to its threatening nuclear program (Labott, 2015) \u2013 its oil exports have tripled (Egan, 2017). With a current crude oil production of approximately 3.8 million barrels per day (bpd) (fig. 2), researchers seek to find out whether Iran\u2019s monthly oil production will exceed the 4 million bpd mark by the beginning of 2018. The following will provide an insight into whether these numbers are actually achievable. \n \tAccording to the senior consultant of research for JBC Energy, these numbers are only achievable if Iran\u2019s technological capacities to extract crude oil are modernized (Egan, 2017). Relying heavily on foreign interest, Iran has therefore composed the Iran Petroleum Contract. Its terms state that there will be an increase in profits obtainable by foreign investors and the guarantee of revenue due to a newly developed risk service (Willn, 2015). Herewith, Iran is aiming to cover its issue of outdated extracting technology: a profound hurdle to achieving reach the newly set mark. However, as argued by O\u2019Donnell, not all terms have been \u2018spelled out\u2019 fully yet, due to Iran\u2019s fear of foreign investments causing troubles in regards to social security through instances such as job-loss for local workers etc. (Egan, 2017).\n \tIt is important to note however that Iran has strong geostrategic interests in the Middle East, especially in regards to the sectarian war in Syria (Gause, 2017). Simply put, more investments imply greater oil revenues and greater oil revenues lead to more money: a needed means for the feasibility of Iran\u2019s geostrategic interests. As Iran is ranked by the CIA as the 16th most prominent international oil exporter its exports are far below those of its competitors Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (\"The World Factbook \u2014 Central Intelligence Agency\", 2017). Thus, in order to boost its power in and over unstable parts of the region, I would like to stress that it will be unlikely for Iran to oppose foreign interest. In fact, only recently Iran has \u201cvowed to increase\u201d oil exports to buyers in the European Union (Levit, 2017)., providing an insight into its willingness to rise through the ranks and to turn a blind eye to possible social security issues.\n \tIn sum, the outdated infrastructure and technology to extract crude oil are leading Iran to attract foreign investors. With an influx of investors, the country is promised an increase in oil production, and foremost an increase in profit. Even though the presence of foreign companies may imply precarious working conditions for the Iranian oil labourers, Iran\u2019s geostrategic interests display that Iran may be willing to overlook this social issue. Additionally, as the current number of barrels produced per month has already reached 3.8 million \u2013 and noting that we are only in the first third of 2017 \u2013 we may assume Iran to be exceeding the 4 million mark before the end of the year.

The market is a decisive factor,\" Luaibi told reporters in Kuwait, where a committee set up to monitor the production cuts is convening on Sunday. He said Iraq was in full compliance with the output-cut agreement. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and 11 other leading oil producers including Russia agreed in December to cut their combined oil output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of the year. The accord was aimed at reducing bloated global inventories and propping up weak oil prices. The agreement has elevated the price of crude to more than $50 a barrel but helped U.S. shale oil producers boost their output, hampering efforts to reduce global stockpiles. Russia said it would reduce production by 200,000 bpd in the first quarter, with cuts reaching 300,000 bpd thereafter.

In the United States, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 were up 12 cents at $47.82 a barrel.

Traders began selling after new data on Wednesday showed U.S. stockpiles have risen to record levels. U.S. oil futures fell another 2% to $49.28 a barrel on Thursday after tumbling 5.4% the day before.

S&P 500 energy shares fell 2.5% on Wednesday, their worst session since September, and initially an additional 1% on Thursday, making it the worst-performing sector in the stock market before a late-day rebound put the sector in the black. Oil driller Transocean Ltd. was among the five worst performers in the S&P 500, down 3.3%. A large number of energy and mining companies are rated below investment grade, making the junk-bond market sensitive to commodity-price swings. The broader high-yield benchmark suggested a premium yield of 3.79 percentage point over Treasury\u2019s on Wednesday from 3.55 percentage point on March 2, according to Merrill Lynch data. Fallout from the oil-market selloff echoes the period early last year when falling crude prices played a part in dragging the S&P 500 down more than 10% and helped push the yields on junk bonds sharply higher. At the time, some economists worried that falling oil could be signaling a slowdown in the global economy, though prices later recovered (para. 1-7). Puko, T., Eisen, B. & Worth, E., A. (2017).

The number of oil and gas rigs drilling in the U.S. has almost doubled since bottoming out at the lowest level in more than 75 years of records. The animation below shows the collapse of America\u2019s energy boom beginning in 2015\u2014and its subsequent resurrection beginning last May. While two dozen nations are coordinating to cut oil production and rein in the global supply glut, U.S. producers are moving in the opposite direction. Over the last four months, output increased by half a million barrels a day. If that rate of expansion continues, the shale boom will break new production records by summer. This decade saw the fastest expansion of oil and gas production in American history. New technology drove the boom\u2014particularly deployment of horizontal drilling through shale rock. Major shale regions include the Permian and Eagle Ford basins in Texas, the Scoop and Stack plays in Oklahoma and the Bakken formation in North Dakota. After the global plunge in oil prices began in late 2014, producers began shutting drilling operations at an unprecedented rate. The number of active oil and gas rigs plummeted 80 percent to the fewest since Baker Hughes started tracking them in 1940. The industry that's returned has been transformed. It employs fewer workers per rig and is even more tightly focused on the rich shale formations that drove America\u2019s oil and gas boom before the crash. Almost 90 percent of the rigs added during the rebound have been of the horizontal variety. Raw rig counts are losing their predictive power. The drilling industry is increasingly automated, and wells are pumping oil faster. Gone are the abundant high-paying jobs in pop-up oil towns filled with roughnecks. The U.S. now produces 9 million barrels a day; when the shale boom first crossed that threshold in 2014, more than twice as many rigs were actively drilling.\\(para. 1-6). Randall, T. & Migliozzi, B.

OPEC will decide on extending its recently enacted production cuts based on how far global inventories fall, the group\u2019s secretary-general said at a conference in London. That has traders optimistic the deal, which aims to cut global production by 1.8 million barrels a day, will get an extension into the second half of the year if oversupply is still a problem, brokers and analysts said. U.S. crude for March delivery recently gained 81 cents, or 1.5%, to $54.21 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The March contract expires at settlement, and the more actively traded April contract recently gained 84 cents, or 1.6%, to $54.62 a barrel. Brent, the global benchmark, gained 72 cents, or 1.3%, to $56.90 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe OPEC and 11 other non-cartel producers reached an agreement to cut output last autumn to end an oil glut that has lingered for more than two years. The deal is for six months, but OPEC leaders from the start said they would consider an extension later this year. The lead up to that deal has kept oil rallying for almost a year now. If prices settled where they traded at Tuesday morning, the session\u2019s gains would put prices at a new 19-month high. Traders have been more optimistic about the deal lately because of a high compliance rate from participants of over 90%. It could push global oil prices to $60 a barrel by the end of the year, despite growth in U.S. supply that has already started from higher prices, said Gordon Kwan, the head of Asia oil and gas at Nomura. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a London oil conference, the OPEC leader Mohamed Barkindo said he expected compliance rates to increase above 90%. He said he agreed with views of Saudi oil minister Khalid al-Falih that members should respect 100% of their commitments to reduce output.\n\u201cOPEC once again has talked up the prices,\u201d Chicago brokerage iiTrader said in its Tuesday note to clients. \u201cNothing new was discussed, literally nothing new at all\u201d (para. 1-8).

The number of U.S. rigs has increased in recent weeks, encouraged by rising oil prices resulting from production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. In addition, Mr.  Trump has said he plans to reduce the U.S.\u2019s reliance on oil imports from OPEC members.\n\u201cWe are not looking at the U.S. as a threat,\u201d OPEC Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo said at a London oil conference. \u201cThere is an understanding that what is good for OPEC is good for the U.S.\u201d Mr. Barkindo said he planned to meet U.S. shale producers next month at an energy conference in Houston, Texas, to exchange information about how they are adapting technologically and financially to lower oil prices. \u201cA lot of them have been reduced to tombstones, unfortunately,\u201d he said. Battered by an oil price crash two years ago, the U.S. shale industry has revived after oil prices rose by 20% in the past two months. Drillers added eight oil rigs in the week to Feb. 10, bringing the total to 591, the most since October 2015, according to U.S. driller Baker Hughes. The price increase was driven by OPEC\u2019s decision in November to reduce production\u2014raising questions about whether the cartel was giving away market share to rivals and hurting its members\u2019 interests. OPEC said this month its members had cut output by about 90% of the 1.2 million barrels a day that they agreed on last November. In addition, non-OPEC producers agreed on Dec 10 to cut 558,000 barrels a day. Mr. Barkindo said Tuesday that he expected the compliance rate to increase and that he agreed with Saudi oil minister Khalid al-Falih that members should respect 100% of their commitments to reduce output. Mr. Barkindo insisted resurgent U.S. shale production would be absorbed by rising oil demand rather than compete with OPEC (para. 1-9). Faucon, B.

This mirrors the U.S., where funds have raised their bullish bets to a fresh record. This comes as reports from both the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and outside observers suggest members of the cartel have achieved around 90% of the production cuts agreed in 2016\u2019s deal. That would mark higher compliance than OPEC has achieved with past agreements.\nHowever, other indicators show the market has some way to go to shake off the massive glut that has depressed prices for more than two years. The U.S. Energy Information Administration said Wednesday that U.S. crude stockpiles rose to their highest level in the week ended Feb. 10 since the collation of data began in the 1980s. \u201cOil prices continue to be pulled between the contradictory influences of reports of falling OPEC production and rising U.S. crude inventories,\u201d David Martin, analyst at J.P. Morgan, said. \u201cThe U.S. stock build sends a cautionary signal to the market at a time when stocks should be starting to decline, rather than build\u201d (para. 1-5). That leaves investors exposed to big losses if sentiment sours. According to Mr. Martin, prices could fall by $5-10 a barrel if inventories continue to increase or demand fails to catch up (para.8).\nOn Monday, Brent crude\u2014the global oil benchmark\u2014was trading at $52.34 a barrel, up 0.8%, while U.S. crude was changing hands at $50.11 a barrel, up 0.6%. Oil prices have jumped by around a fifth since OPEC clinched its production deal in November. Futures, however, have settled in a narrow band above $50 a barrel so far in 2017. Two big producers, Nigeria and Libya, were exempt from the deal and have increased their output. U.S. Energy Information Administration numbers suggest OPEC output cuts, if Nigeria and Libya are included, amount to about 75% of what was promised. Meanwhile, the number of rigs drilling for crude in the U.S. hit a 16-month high last week, according to Baker Hughes.\n\u201cHigher U.S. output, building stocks and the possibility that OPEC continues to fall short of their targeted cuts, could be the perfect catalyst for a speculative sell-off,\u201d Warren Patterson, commodity strategist at ING Bank, said. A key question is whether the OPEC deal will be extended beyond its initial expiry data in June 2017.

Eleven non-OPEC members who joined the agreement have made about half their pledged reductions, according to the IEA.

Resilient oil demand is aiding the effort, growing more than expected last year and poised to do so again in 2017.

McDonald (2016) Jun 27, states that: A major part of the fall in oil prices last year was driven by concerns over the rising production levels of Iran. With nuclear sanctions in place, Iran had been forced to significantly curtail production due to lack of buyers. Once those sanctions disappeared due to the Iranian nuclear deal, the country was prepared to begin exporting crude en masse once more. That outcome caused investors to panic and led oil prices to fall considerably.\nAnalysts reassured the markets that it would take a couple of years for Iran to get production back to pre-sanctions levels. Almost all of this conventional wisdom has turned out to be incredibly wrong.\nIranian oil production has rebounded much faster than many analysts ever anticipated as the chart below shows. At this point, Iran is roughly back to pre-sanctions production levels. Score one against analysts who expected the process to take years.\nThe result is that there is probably very little additional crude that is going to come online from Iran. The country is already pumping as fast as it can, and frankly its post-sanctions export program has been at best minimally successful. Again, this is a ding on conventional wisdom that suggests Iran\u2019s production would have a significant impact on the market share of other major oil producers. This is probably a large part of what has driven Saudi commentary that the oil glut has disappeared.\nIran believes it can move from producing 3.5 million barrels per day (mb/d) in May to 4.8 mb/d by 2021, but to do that the country needs $70 billion in foreign capital to hit the target.\nThe reality is that capital is probably not going to come in the volume that Iran needs. China has its own problems to deal with, and Europe is still very wary of reengaging with Iran. The EIA thinks that the best-case production scenario for Iran is 4.1 mb/d and that\u2019s with the EIA assuming that Iran gets foreign capital and technology, and that sanctions do not remerge on Iran \u2013 a political possibility that cannot be ruled out (para. 1-6). Instead, Iranian crude is mostly being sold to Asian countries \u2013 China, India, Japan, and South Korea. The problem for Iran is that those customers are generally going to be more frugal and probably drive a harder bargain than corporate buyers in Europe. While China and India do have private oil refiners, the reality is that state intervention in both economies means that Iran is really negotiating oil prices with another country. And those countries are perfectly happy to buy crude elsewhere if the desperate Iranians aren\u2019t willing to surrender on price (para. 9). Overall the takeaway for oil investors is that the Iranian threat is probably overdone. There is no indication that Iran has the capacity to keep ramping up production and with oil prices as low as they are, the country would probably have to give ground it can\u2019t afford to cede on price in order to take market share away from existing incumbents (para.9-10).

If Trump tried to do anything to change the Iran nuclear deal (which China is linked with) it could escalate further, already increased, tensions between China and the US.

First meeting for the monitoring committee has been proposed for January 13th, though it will not become apparent for a few months whether Iran is producing in compliance with the agreement.  Iran announced the oil companies that are eligible to bid for new oil projects on the 1st January 2017 - most of which were involved in Iran\u2019s oil projects before the US sanctions were imposed in 2011. According to the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) there are also some newcomers to the list including Maersk (Finland) and Wintershall (Germany), showing signs that other countries are confident in investing in Iran\u2019s energy sector.  However, the investment projects from foreign companies seem to be overshadowed by the incoming Trump administration and what they plan to do about the Iran Nuclear Deal.

Iran has struck a series of deals with foreign energy groups in recent weeks, including Total and Shell, and plans to award more contracts early in 2017 as Tehran\u2019s efforts to attract much-needed foreign investment gather pace. However, BP, which has its corporate roots in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company responsible for the first Iranian oil discovery in 1908, is taking a more cautious approach ahead of a Donald Trump presidency which threatens renewed diplomatic tensions with Tehran. BP has not applied to take part in a forthcoming tender of exploration and production rights in Iran, according to people briefed on the matter, and has no immediate plans for separate agreements of the kind reached by Shell and Total.\nThese people said the main reason was commercial. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of where the best returns on investment can be made and BP has plenty of attractive opportunities elsewhere,\u201d said one. However, these people acknowledged the continued existence of some US sanctions against Iran \u2014 and the prospects of a hardline stance against Tehran by the Trump administration \u2014 was a particular deterrent for BP. Although based in the UK, BP has the biggest US exposure of any European oil group; about 40 per cent of its shareholders and 30 per cent of its employees are American, including Bob Dudley, chief executive. US citizens are barred from commercial activities in Iran under Washington\u2019s bilateral sanctions against Tehran. BP would have to set up a separate governance structure, excluding Mr Dudley and other US executives, to oversee any investments in Iran, according to people briefed on the matter. US energy groups such as ExxonMobil and Chevron have so far remained on the sidelines as Iran has opened up.\nBP has made some tentative steps to rebuild ties with Iran \u2014 including the reopening of an office in Tehran and the acquisition of a cargo of Iranian oil in October \u2014 but more slowly than non-US rivals. A BP spokesman declined to comment. Iran has the world\u2019s second-largest gas reserves and fourth-largest oil reserves, according to the US Energy Information Administration, but urgently needs outside capital and expertise to modernise its ageing infrastructure. The country aims to attract $200bn of oil and gas investment over the next five years, after the 2015 agreement with the world\u2019s major powers to curb its nuclear programme led to the lifting of international sanctions. Total of France became the first western oil major to make a renewed commitment when it signed a deal last month to develop the next phase of Iran\u2019s giant South Pars gasfield together with China National Petroleum Corp.\nUK-listed Shell followed earlier this month with a more tentative agreement for studies of the Azadegan and Yadavaran oilfields in south-west Iran as well as the Kish gasfields in the Gulf. Other companies to have struck agreements with Tehran this year include Gazprom, Rosneft and Lukoil of Russia, ONGC of India and DNO of Norway. Iran has said dozens more applied to take part in a licensing round for up to 50 exploration and production blocs due to take place early in 2017. Jason Rosychuk, a Dubai-based oil and gas specialist at Pinsent Masons, the law firm, said that, after a slow start, Tehran\u2019s investment drive was gaining momentum. \u201cThe level of interest is high,\u201d he said. \u201cAll companies are taking a look.\u201d Tehran has been racing to seal deals before Barack Obama steps down as US president this month.

Gazprom Neft PJSC signed a deal to study the Cheshmeh-Kosh and Changuleh oil fields. This is the 3rd Russian energy company (incl. Lukoil PJSC and Zarubezhneft OAO) to sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Iran. Russia\u2019s energy minister, Novak, has outlined their ambition to become a major investor in the Persian Gulf nation, and has said their priority is to develop Iran\u2019s big projects (bloomberg.com)  Total SA recently said they would develop Phase 2 of Iran\u2019s South Pars gas field and lead a consortium including Chinese oil major CNPC and Iranian oil company Petropas. Schlumberger said it has signed an MoU with National Iranian Ol Company to study formations in the province of Khuzestan (bordering Iraq and the Persian Gulf) - however Schulmberger has said the deal doesn't involved execution of oilfield services (29th November 2016 forbers.com) \nOn the 7th December 2016, Shell signed three MoUs with Iran to develop the South Azadegan and Yadavaran oils fields and the Kish gas field. (reuters.com)  Iran has announced that it would modify its contract model to encourage overseas investments (Iranian constitution prohibits foreign or private ownership of natural resources), but the terms of the contracts are being perceived by some as too advantageous for international companies - concerned that the companies might undermine Iran\u2019s independence. (forbes.com)  There are conflicting reports about how much Iran is producing already. In October 2016, based on secondary sources Iran was producing 3.69mb/d, however based on direct communication they say they were producing 3.92mb/d (data from the OPEC MOMR November 2016). OPEC agreed at the meeting in Austria (November 30th) that Iran will have an exemption from the production cut and will instead allow the nation to boost output from 3.69mb/d to 3.797mb/d (platts.com) - if Iran is producing more that what OPECs secondary sources say then an increase of 107,000 b/d would take them over 4mb/d. This OPEC deal starts from the 1st January 2016 and will run for 6 months, it also has a monitoring committee, headed by Kuwait, to avoid any break down like previous deals. This time period would allow for the foreign companies that have made MoU\u2019s with Iran to study the oil fields. Studying the fields require surveys etc. and take several months. After there is still the pre-drilling stage before production can actually start - this would potentially take it past the January 2018 deadline.  \nIran\u2019s pre-sanction production levels in 2011 were at 4.3mb/d (NY times), but many of the oil fields are old and in decline and require more sophisticated equipment. Without foreign investment they won\u2019t be able to get production back up to this level.  Worth mentioning the continued threat of President-elect Trump on the Iran deal. The New York Times reported (8th December) that the MoUs could provide an insurance policy against any punitive actions taken by the Trump administration. Due to Trump wanting a close relationship with Russia and Russia\u2019s new investments in Iran - it is unlikely the Iran deal will fall apart but could be renegotiated."], [368, "2016-12-13T20:17:26Z", [0.0], ""], [31413, "2016-12-13T15:12:51Z", [0.5], ""], [691, "2016-12-13T13:36:42Z", [0.64], ""], [24109, "2016-12-13T06:37:14Z", [0.5], ""], [368, "2016-12-12T21:37:24Z", [0.0], ""], [14777, "2016-12-12T13:32:18Z", [0.5], ""], [6303, "2016-12-12T01:34:43Z", [0.87], "According to the general news and GJP consensus."], [26467, "2016-12-11T21:25:13Z", [0.8], ""], [368, "2016-12-11T21:01:19Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-12-11T14:26:37Z", [0.7], ""], [4462, "2016-12-11T02:03:53Z", [0.85], ""], [28171, "2016-12-10T19:55:50Z", [0.85], "Iran is already close to that target and typically OPEC deals are not very effective and do not last long.

Purchases by Europe as still far below where they were on a pre-sanctions basis. Italy, once Iran\u2019s best customer in Europe, took more than 5 months to accept its first Iranian oil tanker shipment, while purchases by Spain and Greece also remain far below pre-sanction levels.\nInstead, Iranian crude is mostly being sold to Asian countries \u2013 China, India, Japan, and South Korea. The problem for Iran is that those customers are generally going to be more frugal and probably drive a harder bargain than corporate buyers in Europe. While China and India do have private oil refiners, the reality is that state intervention in both economies means that Iran is really negotiating oil prices with another country. And those countries are perfectly happy to buy crude elsewhere if the desperate Iranians aren\u2019t willing to surrender on price.\nhttp://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Irans-Oil-Production-Is-Slowing-Fast.html After weeks of often tense negotiations, the eventual alignment of OPEC\u2019s biggest producers points to the increasing dominance of Iran among the group\u2019s top ranks.

This leaves Iran shy of 80,000 barrels before hitting the 4 million barrels mark. The month-on-month increase over September and October exceeds 80,000, implying that Iran is en route to meeting the target should the trend continues. What can prevent Iran from meeting the target? Sudden sanctions imposed by the United States and its allies, military/political tensions in the Middle East and an OPEC agreement to restrict oil supply may prevent Iran from producing 4 million barrels a day. While Donald Trump has won the presidential election, he will only be taking over as the president in Jan 2017. Meanwhile, the verbal agreement for OPEC producers to simultaneously reduce output may not work out, given the short lead time required for shale oil producers to ramp output should prices trend higher. All in all, it appears unlikely that there are significant barriers preventing Iran from meeting the target. However, seasonality may play a factor in the near term, as we are nearing a period where crude oil demand wanes. However, this trend is likely to reverse during late winter or early spring. My best guess is that we'll witness 4 million mb/d in November 2016 (i.e. this month).
