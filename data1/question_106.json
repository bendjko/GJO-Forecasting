Merkel's time in power is limited. \nCDU's Horst Seehofer's recent comments make clear Frau Merkel's dilemma:  \"...http://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-security-germany-idUSKCN1021CL \"...\"If one sees how Turkey is dismantling the rule of law ...then these (EU membership) negotiations must be stopped immediately,\" said Horst Seehofer, who heads the Bavaria-based sister party to Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU).\n\"No democratic constitutional state acts like this,\" the leader of the Christian Social Union (CSU) party told the Funke Media Group in an interview. Merkel told President Tayyip Erdogan during a phone call on Monday that Turkey CANNOT  join the EU if it reinstates the death penalty, which has been advocated by members of his AK party...\" So, when Erdogan argues  the EU has breached their side of the so-called EU IMMIGRATION contract he is adding to Merkel's dilemma to maintain the status quo to the EU/Turkish Immigration deal. Additionally, he reiterated his expectation the VISA restrictions for Turkish citizens would be lifted.  AND to add INSULT to Merkel/EU's immigration \"Trojan horse\"\ndeal w/ Erdogan, Erdogan made clear the reintroduction of DEATH penalty is dependent upon his citizens voting upon such a measure. It is our democratic right to make this decision. Should this occur, he would simply follow the will of his people.  http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/turkish-president-accuses-eu-breaking-pact-migrants-40879501 \"...Turkey's president has accused the European Union of failing to uphold its side of a deal to stop migrants from entering Europe.\nRecep Tayyip Erdogan says the EU has transferred only up to 2 million of the 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) promised to Ankara as part of the agreement. In an interview with German broadcaster ARD aired late Monday, Erdogan urged the EU to lift visa requirements for Turkish citizens. He also justified the possible reintroduction of the death penalty in Turkey in response to a recent failed coup...\" Conclusion:\n\nThe numbers remain clear. 226'000 through early July.http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/686608/Migrant-crisis-worse-politicians-dither-thousands-more-flood-Europe Another 775'000 refugees will be needed to resolve this Q to a YES - 1mn for 2016. There is close to a 0 probability of this number being achieved over the next five months for resolution of this GJ Q.  An average of 155'000 per month. We are now in August. OCTOBER - DECEMBER the Mediterranean waters become more seasonally dangerous. This has always slowed traffic quarter on quarter. At its hight in 2015, the refugee numbers per month were similar to 155'000. Since then, however,  the political will & various land blockades have changed dramatically.  W/ every terrorist attack here in EU the voter & political this will to restrict refugee  movement has become more focused. The Balkan regions are essentially shut down. Eastern European routes are \"wired\" to prevent human traffic w/ Government intervention, where necessary.  That leaves travel by sea, which will indeed continue as an important alternative route.

COMMENT:\nUpdate. \nSince my original forecast late March, the fundamental hypothesis has been &, continues to be, even more so post Brexit that, the geopolitical \"push & pull\" of varying Country positions on this hot button immigration issue, would be dealt with emotionally in the first instance. Only thereafter, would the EU SERIOUS side effect consequences of its decisions be given serious consideration.  Professor Kahneman's book Thinking Fast & Slow comes to mind.  EMOTIONAL COMPONENT: \nThus, since March, we have experienced a \"rapid fire closure\" of the Balkan route. Supported by an UNEXPECTED rise of extreme right political influence in Austria, German &, to a lesser extent in French politics as well. Moreover, we have experienced terrorism w/in EU borders. Further support for this fundamental shift. Thereafter, the historic Trojan Horse deal championed by Merkel & the EU w/ Erdogan & Turkey to put a halt to the tsunami of poor souls now stranded in no mans land\"! A landmark decision that will eventually go down as one of the EU's darkest chapters. Merkel has been & continues to be badly damaged politically; saved only by the German economic situation  &, the lack of a credible alternative.  More recently we all experienced the UNEXPECTED but nonetheless ugly side affects ( Tribute to  Jo Cox a Mom, Wife & aspiring respected politician)  of mismanaged campaigns on both sides  of the \"hot button immigration\" Brexit result; leaving a Country indisputably  & seriously divided.  Building this hypothesis month after month, has been NOT only supported by the geopolitical cross current facts from various events, it provides extremely compelling evidence for a judgement on this question. BEFORE year end, without radical action taken by the EU to resolve the refugee dilemma - it created on its own - the Status Quo mentality of lowering, controlling, doing what it can to \"protect\" its borders from the unwanted will remain a fixed part of the political landscape.  EU politicians recognized the 1.5mn in 2015 was & had to remain for their political careers a \"one off\" event looking towards 2016. With half the year gone by, a massive shift in public perception of the refugee dilemma, the raw numbers ( which we can all calculate ) continue to justify an EXTREMELY low probability more than 1mn refugee & migrants arrive in Europe by sea this year.  SIDE EFFECTS:  As we have experienced with the hollowing out of cities in Syria, Iraq ( Aleppo, Fallujah, Mosul TO COME) EU will continue to remain numb to the dramatic developments of leaving refugees encamped on desert no mans land for the foreseeable future. At least, through mid 2017. THINK: at least another 1mn displaced souls by this time next year. WHY? EU politicians are now fighting for their political existence post BREXIT. Syria, Iraq & the ON THE GROUND refugee dilemma has taken a back burner. The fundamental uncertainty created by other Countries looking at a similar push shall take a PRIORITY over refugees being lost at sea.  The numbers attached herewith tell a tragic but accurate story. The EU has a history of avoiding a direct involvement in the face of \"massive human rights violations\". Think - Yugoslavia being torn apart before our very eyes a few years ago. What is the cost of another few thousand refugees losing their lives at sea when balanced against the cost of saving EU's political existence & holding UP THE BORDERS AT ALL costs to keep the EU together?

Erdogan has clearly made a a fundamental and tactical judgement.  The EU now has, as of this point time, a significantly better handle in its refugee crisis on last year.

And it still might. According to the New York Times, \"the Austrians\" are claiming \"that as many as 1 million more migrants are massing in Libya with the aim of crossing into Europe through Italy\"[3]. However the piece is mostly about Europe's (real or imagined) response to refugees and doesn't contain much about whether or not they have something to fear.

Simply a justification, as promised, for my forecast which over the next three to four months needs to be watched carefully:  A.FACTS: There has been a significant and, undeniable  reduction in the flow of refugees/immigrants arriving to Europe by sea through month's end April. The flow of traffic must  dramatically increase to achieve the 1mn mark by year end 2016.  We all know this now. https://www.iom.int/news/mediterranean-migrant-arrivals-2016-184546-deaths-1357\nhttp://reliefweb.int/report/italy/mediterranean-migrant-arrivals-2016-184546-deaths-1357. In addition, we can all do forward looking \"median refugee flow\" calculations to achieve a number that looks well below the 1mn year end mark  using today's flow standard analysis. \n\nHowever, the following issues make such a calculation **unreliable &, CAUTION** is advisable, at least from my perspective.  Here is why. 1. Forward Looking Issue:\nUNCERTAINTY Aleppo : \na) Failure to stop the humanitarian crisis in ALEPPO for example is v likely to create a substantial summer months PUSH of new refugees from Syrian towards Turkey/Greece ( read EU). Numbers could range as high as close 400'000  by UN estimates. http://www.dailysabah.com/syrian-crisis/2016/05/04/400000-refugees-could-flee-to-turkey-if-no-aleppo-truce-un-envoy\nWhy? \nNB: Top Down/Outside View HYPOTHESES: US military absence ( since officially\" pulling troops out\" of Iraq)  in Middle East has created &, will continue to leave a \"power vacuum\"  for the Saudi's & Iran to compete for, w/ each other. Russia, on the other hand, will - increasingly be a meddling influence factor - as best exemplified by the disputed Syrian issue over Assad.   NB: the Assad led attack on Aleppo supported by Russians whose primary objective is to \"hollow out\" ALEPPO w/ Putin's v direct support.  This has already created for Russia \"significant leverage\" to arguably extract itself from the various UN  \"embargoes\" / sanctions to which it has been subjected. NB: recent PM  Japanese Abe meeting in Sochi w/ a potential follow up within the foreseeable future.  Although limited to inter-regional issues, Putin is already on board w/ a G7 leader along w/ a \"potential invitation\" to visit a G7 Country ( Japan).  Additionally, the  UN & Europe WILL  remain off the Syrian battleground. Both Putin & Assad have made their own calculations on these issues as well through the remainder of 2016; especially considering the US is in an election year phase.  All of this plays into the further PUSH of refugees towards Turkey & Greece; especially if, as is probable ( > 65% the world \"simply watches\" again  Aleppo being hollowed out by Assad forces in hopes of gaining a strategic victory at some point in the future, cost what it will).  2. Forward Looking Issue:  \nUNCERTAINTY Turkey: \na) Merkel is on one the hand (to assure the flow of refugee traffic remains at a manageable pace) being being forced to deal w/ Turkey as a critical partner on this issue. The European Commission has  approved visa free travel for Turkish citizens ;  WHETHER this deal is approved/ratified by the Euro parliament is still OPEN. See Below .http://app.ft.com/cms/s/ca306598-120d-11e6-839f-2922947098f0.html EU officials on the other hand, continue to require/offer differing opinions on the minimum requirements for Turkish  visa liberalization to Europe.http://www.dailysabah.com/eu-affairs/2016/05/06/merkel-welcomes-ec-report-eps-turkey-rapporteur-pessimistic-about-ankara\nb) More recently, Ahmet Davutoglu, who was instrumental in negotiating the deal, is gone.http://app.ft.com/cms/s/284333fa-12c1-11e6-91da-096d89bd2173.html Reports conflict on whether he left of his own accord or, whether he was sacked by Erdogan.

Comparison of 2016 to 2015 seems a reasonable way to answer the question therefore. The start of 2016 appeared to demonstrate a much higher trend of sea arrival, whilst the most recent data from April 2016 supports a decrease in arrivals. The breakdown of the problem needs to be examined from multiple angles, this is easiest to do by examining the journey itself: driving pressure (factors that would produce the desire to migrate), perceived and actual difficulties of the journey itself and perceived and actual benefits obtainable at the journey's conclusion.  Driving pressures:\nBoth North Africa and the Middle East contribute to the sea-bound migrating population, which is itself a reflection of the total migrating population. Looking at the population breakdown (UNHCR), it is largely Syrian/Afghan/Iraqi. With the greatest numbers from coming from these regions, the driving forces in these areas are the most relevant in answering the question. Syria is currently undergoing peace talks, and although heavily flawed and perpetually on the verge of collapse, the fact that they are occurring might reduce current migration. If they were to collapse, then it is likely that there will be an increase in migration again. In Afghanistan, the recent start of the summer Taliban offensive has started with a highly aggressive action in Kabul, whilst this may itself be a singular event, it may also represent the start of a more aggressive period which would potentially lead to higher migration. Similarly in Iraq, high tensions between Shia and Shi'ite groups which have precipitated recent direct actions against parliament may compound the ongoing instability from the actions of ISIL. Overall, these factors suggest that the main contributory source migration countries will continue to have strong driving pressures for migration and that these may be higher this year than last year. Overall summary: likely similar or greater driving pressures to 2015 ( estimate +10-+15%). journey troubles:\nThe journey is expensive, dangerous and contains an unpredictable criminal element. In particular, the sea journey must include a criminal element to make the crossing and therefore this probably represents a negative factor on migration due to the high initial costs and limited supply. However, access is now restricted across the EU land border countries, and plans are afoot to increase the difficulty of access to Turkey which, though not a part of Europe itself, plays a pivotal role in the journey. This may decrease the migration initially as refugees are forced to re-route but may also lead to more sea crossings across either the Black sea or longer routes across the Mediterranean. The sea crossing is also affected by patrolling naval/coast guard actions and, to a lesser extent, the various NGO groups who are also involved, however these factors are likely to remain fairly static this year as resources are already stretched. Unpredictable effects, such as the weather, will also play a role in effects month-to-month but may even out if viewed across the whole year, and in any case, are difficult to forecast. The perceived difficulties of making the journey may also affect the numbers attempting the journey, indeed many of the counter migratory strategies seem to hinge on this, however commentaries have made much on the use of social media/mobile communications to stay updated on difficult travel by refugees and it is likely that the perceived difficulties will fluctuate rapidly as the various other effects on the journey play out. Again, at this time, the effect of this, and indeed attempting to quantify the effect of this \"perceived difficulty\" aspect on migration strategy is difficult to interpret, though it will be unlikely to affect total short term travel numbers greatly. Summary: slight decrease (estimate 0 - -5%). Reward at the journey's conclusion.\nEurope has received a high number of refugees across the past few years. Public sentiment across Europe is currently equivocal in supporting their acceptance and is likely to wane further as incidents occur between refugees and locals and resources are stretched to and beyond breaking points in countries with already shaky economies. This will lead to political moves to both spread the refugee load (to less desirable end locations), make access harder and to decrease the benefits to the migrant. Again, the effects of this across the year on migration by sea will depend on the \"perception of benefit\" by potential refugees in their home locations. There may therefore be a long term decrease in attractiveness of migration. However, in the short term this might be a smaller effect. Summary: short term small effect, potentially long term decrease (estimate 0 - -5%). Summary: Clearly there are a huge number of factors involved in the question. Many cannot be estimated with any sense of accuracy e.g. the changes that demand has on the supply of sea transport given the criminal aspect of the market or the impact of fast intra-migrant communications on journey decision planning. The 55% figure I gave represents an attempt to summate the known effects compared to last year (where a figure of just over a million was reached). In phrasing the question like that, it becomes one where comparison of these factors is made with last year rather than a nebulous abstraction. Of the obvious factors, I would currently consider \"driving forces\" in the relevant countries as having probably the greatest effect of migration totals and therefore the numbers attempting a sea crossing. As these in turn are dependent on geopolitical factors that are currently unfavourable, there will likely be similar or slightly more refugees compared to last year. Whilst changes to the journey and the attractiveness of the end location also affect the overall numbers, by my analysis these effects are likely to remain roughly similar to last year, despite changes in both areas that may lead to mid to long term decreases in migration attempts, however it will be very interesting to review these effects as the year unfolds.

During the period of April 1-15, less than 8,000 migrants and refugees have arrived on Europe's shores. That's about half of what we saw last year during this same period[1]. As @Anneinak, @dkc, and @Milosz (as well as others) have pointed out, migrants and refugees are already seeking out other routes - especially Libya-Italy - in place of Turkey-Greece. But it is in no way clear that these alternative routes will support that average of 100,000 migrants and refugees/month for the rest of the year that would be necessary to reach 1,000,000 sea-borne arrivals that is the subject of this question. At the moment, the \"human smuggling infrastructure\" (I'm sorry, but I can't recall from whom I've borrowed that phrase) does not appear to be in place to move so many people. That might change in the long-run, but I have some doubts about it doing so before 2016 ends. All that said, caution is warranted. Most of the inflow of migrants and refugees to Europe occurs during the last 4 months of the year. So there's a very real possibility of reaching a million, but right now I don't think that possibility can be much more than 2-to-1 against. EDIT: Let me add a little perspective. Almost four months into 2016, less than 25,000 migrants and refugees have arrived on Italian shores (mostly Sicilian shores, to be precise). So (assuming that seaborne arrivals via the Turkey-Greece route fall to about 10% of 2015 numbers), you'd have to see about a twenty-fold increase of migrants and refugees coming from North Africa to get close to 1,000,000 total. I doubt that that kind of increase is likely during the next 8 months. Why? Well, here's the a priori case: Smuggling isn't easy. Generally, it's a reprehensible line of work, but clandestinely getting people across the Mediterranean Sea from North Africa to Sicily, landing these folks on the coast, and then skedaddling it back home to do it all again involves a lot of skill. It's not as if fishmongers and waiters are going to enter the smuggling market. Nor is it likely that smugglers could hire qualified people to do this work on short notice.  To repeat, that's just the a priori case. Maybe there are facts on the ground that make this easier than I'm imagining. Tell me if I'm wrong! Along these lines, in an intriguing comment below, @Milosz suggests that ISIS in Libya might get into the smuggling game. Quite right, but I suspect it would take them some time to ramp up production (as it were), and that means ISIS (or a similar jihadist group) would be unlikely to have a decisive affect on whether we'll see 1,000,000 seaborne arrivals this year. Four brief points: First, Syria is much closer to Turkey than it is to Egypt, Libya, and Tunisia (which are the major points of embarkation to Italy). Trust me on this, even though I'm an American; I looked this up on a map and everything. Anyway, getting from Syria to Tunisia will take a lot of time, and that means (once again) less relevance for the number of seaborne refugees and migrants in 2016. Second, if I'm reading the data right, at least 96% of the seaborne refugees and migrants who've arrived in Italy this year were themselves African. Nigerians, for instance, have been the most numerous. There just doesn't seem to be a history of Syrians, Iraqis, and Afghans making their way across north Africa in order to make it to Europe, and that means (I think) a lot of informal barriers to travel. (Think of the time you went on vacation where people weren't used to folks from your country - it's much harder and slower to get around.) Third, though arrivals in Italy were 4 times higher in March 2016 than in March 2015, the pace has slowed a lot since then. There were more than 16,000 arrivals in Italy during March 2015, but there have been less than 6,000 halfway through April 2016. So perhaps we're not seeing the uptick that I expected when I thought about a few weeks ago. Fourth, while the overall flow of seaborne refugees and migrants peaked during November of 2015, the peak of the north Africa-Italy route was already falling fast in September of 2015. Let's assume (as seems reasonable) that these ebbs and flows are a result of seasonal weather conditions. If so, we're likely to have a pretty good guess about how many seaborne refugees and migrants will arrive in Europe via this route long before the end of the year[2]. --- [1] http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/regional.php\n[2] http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/country.php?id=105"], [38, "2016-04-16T23:29:36Z", [0.33], ""], [38, "2016-04-16T23:28:51Z", [0.44], "I'm reading & hearing a lot about how the routes are changing, that now the destination is Italy from Libya, not to Greece, but that this is a much more dangerous route and that the Libyan Coast Guard is patrolling it constantly.

But, we're told, the migrant flow in Greece has recently fallen from about 1,000/day to about 100/day: \"Where thousands arrived in a day, now hundreds \u2014 and some days far fewer \u2014 splash onto the Greek shores from Turkey, a possible sign that the largest mass migration of the 21st century is slowing or that refugees are changing course as Europe scrambles to erect new barriers\"[b]. Let's assume that the fall in the number of arrivals is really a result of political changes and not just changes in the weather or in other conditions that would cause a sharp but temporary lessening of the flow of refugees and migrants. How should we extrapolate this change over the rest of 2016?  One answer is that we should expect current conditions to continue more-or-less as they are. So by December 31, the total number of refugees and migrants who have arrived in Europe will be 160,000 (i.e., the number who are already there) + 27,700 (100 refugees per day for the next 277 days arriving in Greece) + 48,000 (the remaining 9.2% of refugees who arrive by sea elsewhere than in Greece and who - I think - won't be deterred by the EU's deal with Turkey). So the answer is that we should expect about 235,700 by the end of 2016. But what are the assumptions behind this model, and how reasonable are they? Well, the number of refugees in 2015 varied greatly by month, and October saw more than 40 times as many refugees and migrants as January. So perhaps it's more reasonable to project a 90% reduction in refugees and migrants over the year, rather than a constant flow of 100/day. Using last year as a baseline, that would mean 90,000 more refugees and migrants in Greece, not 27,700. But that's still a lot less than 1,000,000. In fact, if we leave aside (for the moment) the question of refugees and migrants arriving elsewhere than in Greece, the EU would only have to impose a 25-or-so% reduction on 2015 on the flow of refugees and migrants in order to keep the total number under 1 million. That seems achievable, though that fact has to be counterbalanced with the fact that the flow of refugees and migrants is 7 times higher during the first 3 months of 2016 than it was during the same months in 2015.   Perhaps this way of thinking of it helps: The demand curve for refugee/migrant status in the EU has been moving sharply out and to the right when compared to 2014 and even 2015 (though its has been slowing steadily since November). Up to this point, the supply curve for refugee/migrant status in the EU has been pretty flat. The result is just what you'd expect: the quantity of refugees/migrants in the EU has gone up dramatically when compared to previous years. But the EU is now trying to cut the quantity supplied by indirectly raising the price of admission. (Obviously, the EU can't directly raise the price, though it is a monopolist of sorts, because the price is paid, not to the EU, but to people who facilitate their travel[c].) So while the demand curve is moving out and to the right, the supply curve is shifting on its axis to be less horizontal and more vertical, i.e., it is experiencing greater price inelasticity of supply [d]. Under these conditions, one can't say what will happen to the equilibrium quantity of refugees/migrants in the EU, unless one knows more about the relative shapes, positions, and movements of both the supply and demand curves. And I doubt anyone has anything more than a crude guess about any of that. Well, I sure don't. But when the demand curve moves out and to the right while the supply curve become for inelastic, you can be damn sure that the price will go up. How much are people willing and able to pay to get the European shores (that is, what's the price inelasticity of demand, as opposed to supply)? That's really the big question, as I see it. If demand is highly inelastic, then, in the long run, refugees and migrants who are trying to get to the EU will just consume other, more expensive, ways of getting there (other than, e.g., the fairly cheap trip from western Turkey to one of the nearby Greek islands, like Lesvos).  Are refugees and migrants willing and able to pay enough to land in Italy including Sicily (please forgive me, my Sicilian friends) as they already have this year to the tune of almost 5,000/month? The trip from Libya to Italy runs $500-$2,000[e]. That's half as much as people were paying for the land voyage to the EU last year[f], and I'm not even sure that's a real option anymore. If we see a sharp rise in the amount of money that refugees and migrants are willing and able to pay during the next, say, five weeks, then I'd expect the chances of getting to 1,000,000 by the end of 2016 are still pretty high. If not, then not. How to find out whether such a sharp rise occurs? I'm working on that.... -- [a] http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/regional.php [b] https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/eu-deal-to-stop-migrants-puts-fear-in-those-waiting-in-turkey/2016/03/26/77c2cc3e-f114-11e5-a2a3-d4e9697917d1_story.html [c] http://www.ibtimes.com/syrian-refugees-heading-europe-are-big-business-lebanons-travel-agents-2126557 [d] http://www.economicsonline.co.uk/Competitive_markets/Price_elasticity_of_supply.html [e] http://www.altaiconsulting.com/mixedmigrationlibya/Altai_Consulting-UNHCR-Mixed_Migration_Libya.pdf [f] http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/refugee-smuggling-a-big-business-in-the-balkans-a-1051461.html"], [53, "2016-03-29T19:44:13Z", [0.2], "Staying low but noting recent uptick in arrivals/rescues between Italy and Libya - almost 1500 in 2 days in late March reportedly (https://euobserver.com/migration/132815 ), not yet in UNHCR data.

The EU reluctantly coming to the table with Turkey to stem the refugee waves seems to have yielded some results after tough negotiations: It now has the right to send the refugees back to Turkey and also has been promised an increase in border security measures by Turkey.In turn, Turkey has been promised 6 billion euros (roughly $6.8 billion) of financial aid for the refugees in the country, visa exemptions for Turks after a set of criteria are fulfilled and the launch of a new chapter to reanimate the EU membership process.\nTurkey has until April to comply with 72 different criteria in order to obtain the visa exemption for the European Union.\n\"There is also a stipulation on establishing an independent commission on monitoring human rights violations by the security forces. There are many criteria. Turkey will be labeled a democratic country if it can implement all of them. Europe for the time being seems to go along with the negotiations, although it knows that these criteria will not be met.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cThe implementation process will be evaluated after the agreement is signed and it will become clear in June 2016 that it will not happen.\"\nMeanwhile, objections are already being heard from Europe. Frans Timmermans, the vice president of the European Commission, said that the visa exemption for Turkey depends on the requirements and that there is no \"shortcut\" for this. Timmermans, noting that the visa exemption will not be easy to accomplish, also said the requirements must be met by April.\nThe negotiation of the readmission agreement, which is jointly discussed with Turkey\u2019s visa exemption for the EU, is not a new idea. Turkey, upon signing the agreement, promises to take back the refugees who originated from the east of Turkey and migrated to Europe. However, experts again warn there might be legal disputes with this agreement. Turkey being a signatory of the 1957 Geneva Convention and the added protocol of 1967 does not recognize asylum seekers as refugees. The refugees in the country are only accepted as \u201cguests.\u201d Here we can talk about an extended protection exclusive to the Syrian refugees but no one has full refugee status. This may lead to a debate on Turkey not meeting the directives of the European Parliament on readmission of refugees in a \u201csafe third country.\u201d According to EU law expert Steve Peers of the University of Essex and Emanuela Roman, a visiting researcher at Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam, Turkey fails to meet the requirements of being a \u201csafe third country\" because it does not recognize the refugee status, not to mention the increasing claims of torture and maltreatment of refugees. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have published reports on maltreatment of refugees in Turkey. As a result, it is held that according to European legislation, the refugees cannot be readmitted to Turkey. While Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said Turkey must show progress on freedom of speech and media, Cyprus has clearly declared that it would veto Turkey\u2019s EU membership.

But I doubt that's the entire story. There's also been a fall off in the number of migrants and refugees since January[c]. The numbers really tell two difficult-to-reconcile tales. On the one had, the decline from January to February and from February to March suggests that we're riding a function that will get asymptotically close to zero as the summer months approach. If that happens, then - of course - there won't be anything close to 1 million refugees and migrants entering Europe this year. On the other hand, two factors push toward the opposite conclusion. First, the number of refugees and migrants tends to increase sharply as we get closer to the second half of the year because of the better weather. Second, there have already been more than 161,000 refugees and migrants in 2016, 8 times as many as the 22,000 at the end of March in 2015[d]. So now what? I suppose one could use a simple function to describe last year's flow of refugees and migrants and then develop another function from this year's flow up to this point in order to extrapolate the flow for the remainder of the year, and, finally, average the two functions. That would be a nice way to kill a little time.  But it might be more fruitful to think about the causal factors in play. bout half (44%) of the refugees and migrants are Syrian, and it's no secret why so many of these good folks want to leave their homeland, at least for now. If conditions stabilize in Syria, the rate of flow will decrease or at least stabilize at a lower level; if not, then not. Russia's unexpectedly swift withdrawal does not, in and of itself, resolve this matter. Assad is in much better shape now than he was six months ago[e]. But that doesn't mean the civil war is over. It's probably closer to the truth to say that Syria has returned to the status quo from a few years ago: a stalemate between Assad and his enemies[f]. Will the parties to the conflict recognize this situation and deescalate? Maybe[g]. And maybe not[h]. I think it's way too soon to tell, and I doubt I can do better than to assign a 0.50 probability to each outcome for now. If nothing else, that means the expected number of refugees and migrants should decrease, since I was operating under the assumption of continued bloody civil war. That said, only half of the refugees and migrants are coming from Syria. There are enough coming from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, and Iraq to push the number of refugees and migrants quite high. The other major causal factor in play at the moment is Europe's (let me be frank) clumsy and embarrassing attempt to get Turkey to staunch the flow of refugees and migrants. It hasn't been going well so far: \"Thousands of Afghans and Iraqis may escape deportation to Turkey as the EU's \u20ac6 billion (\u00a34.7 billion) deal descended into chaos. In a major blow for Brussels, Turkish government sources said they would not change their domestic law to grant Afghans and Iraqis refugee status in Turkey, and to prevent them being deported to warzones. The EU says those changes are essential to make the deal compliant with international law, and therefore to commence deportations\"[i]. Read the whole thing, but only if you've got a strong stomach. Anyway, it's not even clear that the efforts to stop the flow of refugees and migrants is likely to have much of an affect even if interdiction were carried out with considerably less pandaemonium. Problems with sea-worthy vessels appears to be a larger deterrent than the antics of the Keystone Cops a la Turk[j]. But the take away from the point of view of forecasting this question (for me, at any rate) is that some effort to interdict refugees and migrants is being made. My earlier forecast operated on the (then valid) assumption that no such thing was going on. And there's at least some chance that this farrago of willful myopia, selfishness, moral cowardice, and brutality will keep some desperate people from landing on the shores of Lesvos.  <<getting off my soapbox now>> On the basis of all of this, I'm adjusting the probability that there will be 1 million or more new refugees and migrants in Europe this year from 68% to 59%, with more downward revisions in sight if Syria continues to stabilize and EU can manage to wash its hands of the kinds of people who were some common in Europe just a few decades ago.  -- [a] http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35854413 [b] https://www.gjopen.com/questions/106-will-more-than-1-million-refugees-and-migrants-arrive-in-europe-by-sea-in-2016 [c] http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/regional.php [d] http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/regional.php [e] http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/03/putin-russia-withdrawal-syria-assad-turkey.html# [f] http://www.vox.com/2016/3/15/11240318/putin-syria-withdrawal-retro [g] http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/03/13/world/middleeast/syria-control-isis-maps-cease-fire-civil-war-five-years.html [h] http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/syria-war-five-years-hunger-horror-heartbreak-n538661 [i] http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/greece/12200270/Chaos-surrounds-EU-Turkey-deal-as-migrants-keep-flowing-into-Greece.html [j] http://www.dailysabah.com/nation/2016/03/21/boat-problems-not-turkey-eu-deal-deter-migrants-heading-to-europe"], [11096, "2016-03-21T22:18:30Z", [0.5], ""], [11096, "2016-03-21T22:17:49Z", [0.67], "67->50%\nacc to reports smugglers from Izmir (Turkey) left themselves with their families to Greece just in time before this weekend's Turkish-EU agreement.\nRestart thinking on a 50-50% basis and look next weeks who this migration flow will develop.

EU/Turkey deal essentially creates an increasingly asymmetrical relationship b/w EU & the precarious economic/political Greek situation past &, present. With the Turks now in the mix, Merkel & the EU have only increased risks & uncertainties associated with estimating  probabilities and outcome of this so-called deal.  2. That is, although we arguably now know HOW the deal is supposed to work, the multi-country variables of knowing WHETHER they will in fact work have have increased enormously.  3. Finally, the EU/Turkish deal establishes a certain reliance by the EU on a historically unreliable partner in order to achieve a fundamentally critical issue to its long term survival.  The Greeks have a well known track record on this front. They now have an \"extra bargaining chip\" in the hand at their disposal to use/extract/ additional conditions we are not aware of today in exchange for complying w/ their \"present responsibilities\" over these refugees/migrants. Coordinating this immense project w/ at times an unreliable Turkish Government that has a well known predisposition to take advantage of their particular political objectives when confronted with violating of basic human rights adds even greater uncertainty.    In summary on this front,ma questionable deal yes but, little substantive change in the actual flow of traffic to EU borders over existing and new routes due in great part to logistical and geopolitical issues. 4. Balanced against the 1-3 arguments, is the recent Russian pullout. Here, the momentum of Syrian exodus on the ground has a high probability of slowing. \n5.

He remains v/ skeptical the present solutions of NO limits will resolve the fundamental German problem. Yet, he does confirm  the Austrians & Balkan Countries have essentially closed down the flow and, thereby somewhat relieved BDR of its issues, he is thankful. He claimed most other Countries are practicing a type of \"covert upper limit\" policy. When questioned about the present flow to BDR that - not even his 200K limit - seems possible at this stage, he said his initial upper limits was correct from the start and, now BDR must make this practice explicit limit to leave no doubt. And, if that trend holds up, not even his upper 200K will be reached.

What they refer to is the latest surge in PKK attacks within Turkey since the summer of 2015. What is missing from such characterization of recent developments is that Erdogan personally holds Kurds and the Kurdish party HDP accountable for preventing him from assuming even greater control of the country in the June 7, 2015 election. The extensive security operations in southeast Turkey targeting both PKK militants and Kurdish civilians in cities such as Sur, Cizre, and Diyarbakir are a form of payback,\u201d writes A. Kadir Yildirim for the Huffington Post. \u201cOver the past nine months, Turkey has been hit by six major bombings that have killed more than 220 people and exposed how the government has failed to insulate the country from the fallout of the Syrian war next door. The danger posed by Islamic State, once viewed by Ankara as containable, has metastasized into a two-front war against the extremist group and Kurdish separatists that has brought home the violence racking neighboring countries. Many worry Turkey is embroiled in a war it is ill-prepared to fight,\u201d writes Dion Nissenbaum for the Wall Street Journal. \u201cNow, looking at the current picture in Turkey it\u2019s hard for anybody to not be concerned about the future. The rise in terrorism has caused a deep trauma and spread fear in society, which will have lasting effects on the country\u2019s social order. The responsibility to overcome this tragedy sits on the shoulders of politicians from all walks of life, with the government at the top. Its primary duty should be to reject perceptions and comments suggesting that the Turkish people should learn to live with terror,\u201d writes Serkan Demirtas for the Hurriyet Daily News.

How many are crewed by \"professionals\" that return to Turkey? Imprisonment of these professional crews is also an important deterrent.

If I were Turkey I'd be sure to insist that this component was part of the bargain. Yes, we will stop the flow; but if the EU does not have in place a rational plan for the orderly intake of these refugees, then we re-open the flow.

(edited to correct error, comparing to Feb 2015, not 2014. )"], [14531, "2016-02-29T21:19:10Z", [0.75], "Here are a few general points that helped me understand the context: The BBC reports that \"More than a million migrants and refugees crossed into Europe in 2015.\" Specially 1,294,000, 78% (just over 1 million) of whom arrive by sea, and 37% of whom seek asylum in Germany. The most common entry points are in the Mediterranean: Spain, Italy, and - especially - Greece [1]. Currently, Syrians make up about half of the migrants and refugees crossing into Europe, though about a quarter come from Afghanistan. Importantly, only 283,532 migrants and refugees entered Europe in 2014[2]. So 2015 represents a roughly 450% increase in the number of migrants and refugees entering Europe. Over the long run, I expect the number of sea-borne migrants and refugees entering Europe (hereafter \"M&Rs\" - note that I'll take the qualification \"by sea\" for granted and not repeat it in order to avoid some tedium) to return to previous historical levels. But the current situation in many way does not resemble the historical situation. Trying to estimate the number of men 18-30 who would die in Europe is usually best done by looking at earlier historical levels. But from 1939-1945, the previous historical levels would have been pretty useless. I think we're in a situation more-or-less like that with regard to M&Rs in Europe.  There often seem to be two sides to the equation. One is a demand side; here, M&Rs seeking entry to Europe. The other is a supply side; the EU and individual European nation-states (including non-EU nation-states like Switzerland) who can grant entry to Europe. The demand side of the equation looks to remain very high. To engage in a bit of reckless generalization, the situation in places like Syria and Afghanistan (which made up about 70% of M&Rs in 2015) does not appear to be getting any better. Similarly, places like Iraq and Iran continue to generate sizable numbers of M&Rs. None of these countries appear to have been emptied of potential M&Rs either. So on the demand side, last year is probably the best guide for this year. Since the number of M&Rs in 2015 was a bit over 1 million, I'd bet that there is a high probability (70% or so) that the number will be between 850,000 and 1,250,000 for 2016, with smallish tails (15% or so) on both sides. That translates to about a 52% chance that over 1 million M&Rs. Obliviously, I'll want to continue to update the demand numbers as more information becomes available. And the UNHCR reports that there have been 130,110 (call it 130,000) M&Rs so far (2/29) in 2016. That's about 13% of 1,000,000 M&Rs, about 16% of the way through the year. So it looks as if we're a bit off the pace of 2015. But in fact the number of R&Ms went up considerably in later months of 2015, peaking in October. If I'm reading the data right, there were only 5,550M&Rs in January 2015 and 7,271 M&Rs in February 2015[3]. So, if I'm reading the situation rightly (and I really wonder if I am since the result is so surprising), we're an order of magnitude ahead of the pace set in 2015. Another way to put it is this: At the end of February, 2015 the total number of M&Rs was 1% of 1,000,000. At the end of February, 2016 the total number of M&Rs was 13% of 1,000,000. All of this suggests that the probability that demand side will be over a million is higher than 52%. I'd call it something closer to 75%, with that probability rising if the number of M&Rs remains so high in March.  But what about the supply side? The EU and individual European nation-states could limit the number of places for M&Rs. Austria[4], Hungary[5], and Slovenia[6] have done so, as have some other European nation-states. But these are largely barriers to entry (or migration internal to Europe) by land. These barriers will not (directly) prevent entry by sea. There has been some talk of the EU \"ring-fencing\" Greece[7], which would probably make an already difficult situation in that troubled country much worse. But Greece is still a part of the EU, so a landing there is still a landing in Europe, which is all that matters for the purposes of this question. Perhaps some think that ring-fencing Greece would force the Greek government to discourage M&Rs further. However, I doubt Greece has the resources necessary to do much more than they already are. (BTW, the human cost to the M&Rs of being subjected to - what to say? - a low cost effort to prevent landing in the EU would likely be horrendous[8].) In general, the EU has just not (yet) shown that it can change much on the supply side of the equation, though that might change. So a 75% likelihood that there will be 1,000,000 or more M&Rs in 2016 looks right to me for now. --- [1] http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34131911 [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_migrant_crisis [3] http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/regional.php [4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_border_barrier [5] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_border_barrier [6] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenian_border_barrier [7] http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/c40504cc-c12b-11e5-9fdb-87b8d15baec2.html#axzz41an3ZbDM [8] http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/22/could-australia-stop-the-boats-policy-solve-europe-migrant-crisis"], [20807, "2016-02-29T21:04:21Z", [0.8], "Yes, because European politicians are too weak to do anything about it."], [73, "2016-02-29T15:56:50Z", [0.83], "+1 Jan was originally recorded as 62369, now reported as 73156.

Well, Die Welt report that about 150-200k Africans are currently sitting on the Libyan coast waiting for better weather to attempt the crossing to Libya, so that's a positive indicator, given that Libya is actually just a secondary source of migrants (Turkey is obviously the main starting point for journeys http://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article152460616/200-000-Fluechtlinge-warten-auf-Ueberfahrt-nach-Europa.html?wtrid=socialmedia.socialflow....socialflow_twitter).

We are begged the question: How likely is it that we are going to see a summer surge of a similar size as 2015? Or, alternatively, to what extent was the 2015 surge caused by predictable climatic patterns? I will argue that climate did not play the dominant role in the 2015 crisis.  - If we look at the 2014 data (2), we indeed see a summer surge - however, unlike 2015, the 2014 surge started around April, peaked in August - September and died down around October-November. Furthermore, it is not clear that a huge summer surge happens most years. The best data I could find from a google search (3) shows that sea arrivals *don't* follow a clear pattern: In 2012, Sea arrivals were highest in Q4; in 2011, they were highest in Q2, but Q1 was very close and Q3 was much further below (If anyone finds some nice data for 2013, please let me know). - We *can* say for certain that a surge of a magnitude of 2015 - where October rates were roughly 20x higher than they were in march - is totally unprecedented (in recent years). Squinting at the graph tells me that in the peak of the 2014 surge, the rate was about 4x higher than march. So unless the weather in the Mediterranean was *unbelievably* conducive to immigration that summer, I'm fairly certain that the surge was rooted in politics. - The rate of arrivals by sea is decreasing much, much faster than you would expect to be caused by climate. December 2015 had nearly twice as many arrivals as January 2016, but it'd be pretty absurd to believe that migrating during January is twice as difficult as migrating during December. Similarly, February will probably see less than 30,000 arrivals, which is less than half of January, which really can't be caused by climate. This suggests that the late 2015 surge is still in the process of dying, and we should expect a much more routine year in 2016. So: Assuming we see 100,000 arrivals this Jan and Feb (I think this is a bit generous, but nonetheless), we'd need another 900,000 arrivals over the course of the year (90,000 per month). The peak of the 2014 surge had about 40,000 per month. The only way that we'll see more than a million arrivals this year is if there's a repeat of the (almost certainly politically caused) surge of 2015, and I'm not sure why we should expect that. I did bump the chance up from 7% to 9%, but I still think it's really unlikely. I'll update depending on the intake for Feb and March. I'm expecting about 30,000 arrivals in February - if it's more than that i'll bump up, if it's less I'll bump down. I'm pretty sure this is one of the questions where the rest of GJP is just *wrong*.

The peak was in October, when 221k people arrived, and it's fallen dramatically since then - 65k people arrived this January, and only 14k arrived between 1-11 Feb. If we assume the rate of arrival this February to remain constant then only 30k will arrive this month. If we predict another 30k for the remaining months of the year, then there are only going to be 400,000 arrivals in 2016, which is less than half of the required number. There are 2 ways that I think the current rate will more than double: \n- Europe massively eases its immigration restrictions. This seems incredibly unlikely, as the political climate has become increasingly opposed to immigration - it would be political suicide in most European countries to suggest that they take more immigrants in right now. I'd say there's at most a 3% chance of this happening. - A major war breaks out in North Africa or the Middle East, leading to an extra 600,000 more immigrants arriving. This is also pretty unlikely: Sure, wars break out all the time but very rarely do they involve 600,000 refugees in less than a year. Given that 41% of arrivals are from Syria, we'd expect 164,000 Syrians to arrive this year - meaning that for a war (or number of wars) to produce 600,000 refugees this year, it would have to be more than three times as violent as the Syrian war (or even larger if it happened later in the year). This is... unlikely. I'll call it 2%. Random fluctuations do not seem like a plausible way for refugee intake to increase this much, but I'll be a little cautious and put it at 1%. 1 - (0.99 *0.98 *0.97) = 6%.

Now, January arrivals in Greece is up so far sees 42.000 arrivals versus 1.700 in 2015 and 1.000 in 2014. This happens while the start of January has been very cold (-20 in Macedonia). Greece is the key country to watch as 84% of all migrants arrived there. [1] 2. Refugees currently number 2,5 mln in Turkey, with a further 1,1 mln in Lebanon and 0,6 mln in Jordan. The total 4,2 mln could push the arrivals to 1 million for 2016. The situation in the three main departure countries in 2015 are Syria 48%, Afganistan 21%, Iraq 9% are unlikely to allow return in 2016. [3]  In addition, allready arrived refugees could spur more to come as more information, assistance and knowledge of the route becomes available. 3. Europe is gearing up to improve border checks in Greece, the REPORTED number could well get higher, as currently some migrants are forwarded without arrival admininstration; explaining the low UNFCCC number compared to arrivals further on in Europe (Germany reported more than 1 mln arrivals for example).  4. Turkey is not yet slowing down departures and 'little action is seen so far', one of the reasons is that Italy is witholding the promissed aid money [3]. Turkey is one of the key uncertainties in the question and a further belligirent Russia could promt Turkey to warm up to NATO and the EU and (attempt to) enforce lower departures.  [4] 5. Germany speaks of a 'Plan B', the prediction is the same: that Angela Merkel is on the brink of reversing the generous policy towards asylum-seekers that saw more than a million of them reach Germany last year. This could reduce the pull factor. In addition, 'the Germans are changing tack, seeking allies willing to help them resettle hundreds of thousands of Syrians directly from Turkey'. [5] If this is done by plane it would reduce possible arrivals.  Responses are most welcome. It's still early days for this question.

Movements of refugees between countries are movements within the system, not movements *into* the system. It's not that internal flow information on refugees is not relevant at all, but only that it might be less relevant to the question than we might initially assume. The internal migration chain might \"back up\" to the EU frontier. The methods of handling internal border movements might be indicative of attitudes of decision makers, etc. But I'm suggesting we need to focus more on identifying the causal factors relating to the ultimate source of refugees (even the specific battles maybe) and the nature of the EU system interface that adjoins the seas.\n2) I call your attention again, to the paper by Kelly Greenhill, entitled \"Weapons of Mass Migration\" (provided to us courtesy of @praedico, and which I promise I will not reference again): http://calhoun.nps.edu/bitstream/handle/10945/11515/SI_V9_I1_2010_Greenhill_116.pdf I suggest, also for the last time, that we are seeing the theories espoused in this paper played out before us in real time. My essential claim is that, if this is true, we are witnessing a covert coercive bargaining game of sorts. Or, at least this is one possibility that we should not neglect to seek evidence for or against. I call your attention also to the following article which while headlined under, and beginning with, an orientation toward tensions relating to internal open borders, moves on to address the issue of Turkey as a \"valve\" of sorts capable of determining the absolute volume of the flow. The language used to describe the efforts by Turkey to stem the flow is becoming more aggressive (e.g. \"crack down\"). In short, while the bargaining may be going on behind-the-scenes, I'm suggesting that we should be seeking more information on what such (other) steps by Turkey might look like if they were to actually be able to reduce the flow below the 1MM question threshold. There are talks of work permits, housing, etc. What's the status of these projects and would they be sufficient? It's conceivable that any steps they might reasonably take would still be insufficient, and Davutoglu may be sincere when he says \"Turkey is doing its best to balance humanitarian responsibilities while combating illegal migration\" -- or, he could be playing a bargaining position.\nhttp://www.wsj.com/articles/germany-turkey-to-intensify-illegal-immigration-fight-1453482293 \u201cI pledged once again today that we Europeans will provide the \u20ac3 billion\" Also, can we consider that Turkey may wish to \"exchange\" the refugee problem for something beside plain cash?

Alternatively, it could be an error by the other commenter. \nHere is the report I reviewed: http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2016/sdn1602.pdfThis report states: \u201cBased on an inflow of 1.3 million first-time asylum seekers annually from 2015\u201317, tapering off afterwards, coupled with a 40 percent rejection rate.\u201d(pg.13) If these asylum seekers are mostly sea arrivals, then the IMF believes that at least one million refugees will arrive by sea  in 2016. Unfortunately, the report does not explain how they arrived at this estimate.  My outside view at this point breaks down as follows:\nRefugee inflows by sea (2016): \n<500K (5%) (almost certainly not) \n501K \u2013 750K (30%) (probably not)\n751K \u2013 1.2 mil. (65%) (Probable) Inside View Factors (weights are percentages that would be applied to current expected outcome): 1.\tWeather. Although it would seem like an important variable, the desire to enter Europe seems to outweigh the challenges of the sea in the worst months. No weight to this variable. \n2.\tTurkey taking steps to better accommodate/integrate refugees. Although the EU has pledged Turkey 3 billion to help manage the crisis and stem the flow, it remains to be seen if the deal holds and what Turkey does with the money.  I am dubious about the prospect of spending one\u2019s way out of this crisis. For these reasons, I am not giving this variable much weight. (-1)\n3.\tBorder controls. If the refugee flows continue unabated, the passport-free Schengen Area is in real danger of collapsing. If this happens, the flow could be stemmed as word spreads in the refugee producing countries that the path through Europe is closed. If this does happen, then I would estimate this would have a significant impact on sea arrivals. This could swing percentages considerably. (-15-20)\n4.\tEuropean social unrest. The recent events in Cologne, Germany and the rise of the right in Europe do not bode well for sentiments toward refugees. If these tensions escalate to violence in Europe, pressure could be applied to close borders or impose stricter limits on inflows. From the refugee side, social unrest in Europe might seem benign compared to what they are leaving. So, the rise in anti-refugee sentiment might not dissuade people from making the trip to Europe. (-4)\n5.\tImprovements in the conditions of the countries producing the most refugees. If you look at the top four: Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Eritrea, no current news suggests any improvement in conditions in the short term. Eritrea is the only one where things may get better. The others are failed states and war zones. No weight to this variable.  Since my \u201cprobable\u201d range includes an outcome where the question would not resolve in my favor, I am stating at the outset that I believe the likelihood is at least 1 mil. or more. I\u2019ll make adjustments accordingly."], [12874, "2016-01-20T22:28:12Z", [0.77], ""], [12874, "2016-01-20T22:27:54Z", [0.72], ""], [13984, "2016-01-20T22:07:46Z", [0.95], ""], [15929, "2016-01-20T19:49:46Z", [0.82], "IMF report released today states more than 3 million refugees expected to hit Europe on 2016.

After the agreement with the EU was signed, Prime Minister of Turkey Ahmet Davutoglu said that he can give \u201cno guarantees\u201d and that everything will depend on what is happening in Syria\u2026. ...Gerald Knaus, head of the European Stability Initiative, said it had been unrealistic to envisage that the agreement would bring down refugee numbers. \u201cIt was obvious to everybody three months ago that it wouldn\u2019t work. Both sides are to blame for that, because they didn\u2019t negotiate seriously,\u201d he said. The only solution, he added, would be if Turkey dedicated itself to taking back refugees who had left the country for Greece and whose asylum applications had been rejected.\n_______ All considered, I am still giving a very slight advantage to base rate though a large increase wouldn\u2019t surprise me at all.

The UNHCR input is particularly helpful. The EU is unlikely to make any attempts to seriously protect its borders in the short term, regardless of public discontent in numerous countries at the level of migration (of whom actual refugees in practice only appear to constitute a small proportion). Thus far the principal attempts to deal with the crisis have been to impose checks on national borders within the EU (Sweden-Denmark, Denmark-Germany, France-Italy), rather to seriously check external borders. As yet the political - not to mention institutional - will to do so appears limited: and the EU bureaucracy has shown itself to be anything but fast-moving (indeed, decision-making structures prevent it from so being). The ECHR will impede deportations of those who arrive illegally (a few smaller EU countries - perhaps Poland, Hungary, conceivably Czech Republic) might ignore this - but such countries are hardly the principal intended destinations of migrants. Should more nationalist governments come to power in major EU states, the situation could change - but even in such cases national governments would still have great fights with the EU institutions over numerous areas of sovereignty.

With the \u201cgood times\u201d over, as at least in Germany the life of a typical refugee is not all that prosperous as maybe thought, the economically motived refugees should become less.

In Germany, it take between 6-24 months to have the status approved, meaning very few families will be transferred in 2016, thus voiding this aspect in light of the GJOpen question\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Turkey as a Nato nation, aspiring EU nation and Germany is their main trading partner, pressure to keep there word will be mounting.

That biases me towards upwards of 50% on this IFP. (I have also emailed UNCHR headquarters and will let you guys know when/if I get a response) Further thoughts: 1:) eyeballing the 2015 data at http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/regional.php, it's obvious that despite all the hype, the death rates on the sea journey are very low - under half a percent. Given the potential economic payoffs of a likely journey to Europe, such a death rate is unlikely to deter anyone. Deaths at sea this winter appear to have been quite low, evidence of both good weather and perhaps also that the smuggling operations have got more professional (any data on this?) 2:) the Syrian conflict appears frozen and is unlikely to resolve in any kind of way any time soon.  3): migrant flow is not purely a function of violence in Syria. Only 49% of migrants making the sea journey in 2015 actually came from Syria (http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/regional.php), and given the prevalance of fake Syrian passports this number is likely to be a substantial overestimate. Much of the third world has become just rich enough for substantial numbers of its people to be able to afford the journey to a Europe which thus far has proved totally unwilling to defend its borders, creating a substantial pull factor in addition to the push. 4:) while Europe can arguably shut down land-based migration through Bulgaria very easily if it wants, this will just push migrants onto the sea route 5:) The European Court of Human Rights takes the view that sending migrants back once they have reached European territory is practically illegal (see p.20) http://www.coe.int/t/democracy/migration/Source/migration/ProtectingMigrantsECHR_ESCWeb.pdf. This severely limits the options Europe has to cut the pull factor. 6:) therefore, it is not immediately obvious to me what Europe can really do to shut sea-route migrant flow down without taking the drastic step of ignoring the ECHR, even if more terrorist attacks and incidents like the Rape of Cologne (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-35231046) occur (as they inevitably will). 7;) betting on quick and efficient EU decision-making and action has historically proved a very stupid thing to do"], [1646, "2016-01-06T14:28:21Z", [0.13], "Adding to all the other good analysis on the no side, arriving to Europe is expensive, and most potential refugees with the money to travel may have already done so."], [4042, "2016-01-06T13:50:41Z", [0.33], ""], [4042, "2016-01-06T13:49:37Z", [0.4], ""], [740, "2016-01-06T13:32:28Z", [0.31], ""], [6552, "2016-01-06T13:14:35Z", [0.75], "It will require draconian measures to prevent it."], [599, "2016-01-06T12:36:34Z", [0.65], ""], [12874, "2016-01-06T12:18:21Z", [0.4], ""], [4634, "2016-01-06T10:39:42Z", [0.65], ""], [10759, "2016-01-06T10:39:31Z", [0.65], ""], [10759, "2016-01-06T10:38:31Z", [0.6], ""], [4634, "2016-01-06T10:37:57Z", [0.6], ""], [4936, "2016-01-06T10:11:50Z", [0.25], ""], [3474, "2016-01-06T08:51:12Z", [0.25], "Syria, Libya, are all in crisis.

In January 2015, there were 5,550 comapred to 3,270, a 70% uplift\n2. In February 2015, there were 7,231, a 66% uplift\n3. In March, 10,424, a 43% uplift.\n4.

First 5 days of January 2016: 11x the daily arrival rate of 2015; 19x the daily arrival rate of 2014 All signs point to an acceleration of sea arrivals in the latter half of 2015 and the beginning of 2016.  To give you a feel, you need an average of 3,000 daily arrivals by sea to get to YES on this.  They are at 2,000 per day in the first 5 days of 2016.  This is in very bad sea conditions and the corresponding figure is <200 in 2015.  The by-land arrivals can be stopped through various means but it is not clear what to do with people on a boat. Another consideration is that the people most desperate to escape have already arrived.  Syria has 22 million people, 500K have gone to europe in 2015, 4 million have gone elsewhere.  Presumably there are 18 million who remain.  But we will see escalation of civil war in both Syria and Iraq (100K in 2015) and some of the 4 million may be tempted to take the boat trip as the technology of the journey improves.  I dont see the 'supply' of refugees as a factor here and it may actually increase as smugglers attract capital and increase efficiency.

A further escalation of the conflict in Syria seems unlikely (what more could happen?) and I expect & hope that European and other contries will donate more to support the UNHCR work in the region - thus reducing the need to flee further (and maybe die trying). However, if the crisis in Libya escalates and the agreement between the two Libyan governments does not hold (it actually looks like it could fail atm), a new major refugeeroute from Libya to Italy could pop up. Thousands of Africans are imprisoned inside Libya or being held in refugee camps, largely controlled by militias.
