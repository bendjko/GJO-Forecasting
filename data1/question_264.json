Not even the Minsk agreement that would rule the non-government controlled areas and its voting has been implemented. Germany and France diplomacy efforts resulted in null effect, as they anticipated it would. In addition to conflict, the Minsk agreement has created a series of inconvenience and stress to the population of the conflict area that depends on lengthy and stressful bureaucracy to get day-to-day benefits. An example is the increased bureaucracy that led to more people crossing the contact lines in dangerous situation.

Nationalism is reported to be rising. It is possible that Russia pushes its presence into the conflict zones by influencing and/or backing separatists and taking advantage of any sparks that arise out of the internally displaced persons stress of the Right-Sector action towards an unfavorable resolution of the UN-Ukraine Trade Deal Agreement. 1. Existing Eastern Ukraine tension That region is the eastern Ukraine, where UNHCR estimates that 800,000 people live without reliable access to safe housing, supplies, and heat. \nUkraine's Defense Intelligence and other sources warn that combined Russian-separatist forces, operating in the occupied territories of eastern Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions, are deploying troops and carrying exercises along the Donbas contact line. (https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/europe-and-central-asia/ukraine/report-ukraine and http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/ukraine_-_issue_11_eng.pdf). Ukraine\u2019s Defense intelligence alleges that they are plotting massive provocations along the whole contact line against the Armed Forces of Ukraine in order to accuse the Ukrainian side of violating Minsk agreements.  \u201cOn 11 February 2015, the DPR signed the Minsk II agreement that arranged that rebel-held territory would be reintegrated into Ukraine in exchange for an overhaul of the Ukrainian constitution that would grant it, as well as Luhansk People's Republic, self-governing status within Ukraine by the end of 2015.[23][24][25] In the summer of 2015, DPR \"Prime Minister\" Alexander Zakharchenko claimed that the DPR \"will never be part of Ukraine\".[26] As of April 2016, the Ukrainian parliament has not scheduled to vote to implement the constitutional reform set out in the Minsk II agreement.[27]\u201d\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donetsk_People%27s_Republic Donetsk People's Republic (DPR or DNR) is deemed a terrorist group by Ukraine government. It is backed by Russia. It controls Donetsk and Horlivka \u2013 the major cities in Donetsk Oblast. A meeting in Berlin between the leaders of France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine was held in October and it evidenced the failure of the agreement. It also evidenced the failure of diplomacy to mitigate the problem. The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) continues to report ceasefire violations in the Donetsk regions (http://www.osce.org/ukraine-smm/279531)\nEven though it is no match for Russian military power, Ukraine has increased its military budget as well as its military contingent. http://dailysignal.com/2016/11/02/eastern-europe-arms-itself-against-russian-military-aggression/ 2. Rising Nationalism and the Right-Sector Nationalism in Ukraine is rising and 77% of Ukrainians consider Russia to be a threat to its neighbors. http://dailysignal.com/2016/11/02/eastern-europe-arms-itself-against-russian-military-aggression/ The Right-Sector was originally a paramilitary confederation in Maidan Square and is relied upon by the Ukrainian government to combat \u201cterrorism activities\u201d.  The Surkov Leaks suggested ties between Russia and the separatists rebels (http://ukraine.csis.org/#494) According to Tarik Cyril Amar, associate professor of history at Columbia University, Russia views the conflict as taking back territory that was historically Soviet. http://dailysignal.com/2016/11/02/eastern-europe-arms-itself-against-russian-military-aggression/ The challenge is that the Right-Sector has failed to produce good leaders, talented ideologists and convincing authors of propaganda material. In other words, it has  failed to establish itself as a feasible option of structured government. {http://www.academia.edu/27715875/The_Right_Sector_and_Others_National_Radicals_and_the_Ukrainian_Political_Crisis_of_Late_2013_Early_2104) 3. Trigger of tension \u2013 EU-Ukraine Trade Deal \u201cLess than three years ago, millions of Ukrainians took to the streets in order to defend their choice of European integration and values which unite democratic nations of today\u2019s Europe. The Euromaidan protest became one of the largest and the most powerful events in support of the European Union since its creation. It is ironic that, today, one of its founding members, can jeopardize not only the future of the pro-European, reform-oriented forces in Ukraine, but undermine the unity, policies and the spirit of the union.\u201d The Ukraine agreement came fully into provisional force at the start of 2016, and has been backed by all EU member states except the Netherlands. It is a key symbol of support for the country\u2019s pro-Western government. The Dutch PM ways to sign it off, but he is also seeking a third term in March 2017 parliamentary elections. The Netherlands held an advisory referendum on signing off the agreement and the answer was no. (http://ukraine.csis.org/#496) 4. Trigger of tension \u2013 Internally Displaced Persons The conflict has created a contingent of internally displaced persons facing serious challenges. Recently, an increasing number of people is crossing Russian-controlled contact lines. These crossings are lengthy ands stressful.   A registered displaced person receives an IDP certificate issued by government authorities.36 Obtaining an IDP certificate is a pre-condition for receiving pensions, social allowances, benefits37 and other payments intended to assist IDPs.38 Many IDPs reported the registration process as being complex and cumbersome. A lack of adequate information on IDP entitlements, as well as the absence of a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d to receive assistance, was identified by many IDPs as obstacles to effectively exercising their rights. In all regions, IDPs consistently complained about having to re-register every six months in order to continue receiving the allowances.39 \n(http://www.osce.org/ukraine-smm/261176?download=true)  \u201cThe Border Guard Service recorded 816,000 people crossings, almost 100,000 (or 12 per cent) more than in May. People travel across the \u2018contact line\u2019 in order to visit relatives, buy food and other goods, receive social payments and look after property. One reason for the recent increase in crossings is the ongoing struggle of pensioners residing in non-government controlled areas (NGCA) to get their pensions reinstated after they were suspended in February. Following the removal of a bureaucratic obstacle on 8 June, numerous pensioners rushed to Departments of Social Protection in Government-controlled areas (GCAs).\u201c\n(http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/ukraine_-_issue_11_eng.pdf)  5. Trigger of tension \u2013 Lack of International Support Unreliable international military support to a conflict leaves Ukraine to its own devices. \u201cToday, NATO members such as the U.S., Canada, and Poland have military training missions ongoing in Ukraine, but NATO troops are not directly involved in combat operations in the Donbas.\n\u201cThere was never any possibility of NATO combat troops being stationed in Ukraine,\u201d Wheatley said.\n(\u2026)\nThe deployments are considered \u201ctripwire forces,\u201d presumably meant to deter Russia from an attack due to the risk of spurring a massive NATO response to defend forward units.\n\u201cThey\u2019re really just notional forces,\u201d Russell said, referring to the NATO units. \u201cThey\u2019re not at all capable of doing anything offensive into Russia.\u201d\nhttp://dailysignal.com/2016/11/02/eastern-europe-arms-itself-against-russian-military-aggression/"], [368, "2016-11-06T21:18:36Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2016-11-05T19:59:21Z", [0.0], ""], [29266, "2016-11-05T13:34:20Z", [0.0], ""], [19725, "2016-11-04T23:05:57Z", [0.0], "Far from muslim targets for considering perentage of \"unexpected\" attacks, remains russia, and it's settling down.

And the dynamic so far these years has been \u2013 a flare up in summer and less hostilities in winter. And no more airplanes to shoot above Donbass. What if the dynamics changes? Russia decides to get all Novorossiaya (with Russian-speakers as majority)?  That\u2019s almost half of Ukraine. Or even all Ukraine?  Losses among civilians will be enormous. While there are pundits who say it is probable, I do not think so. It does not fit Russian policies \u2013 UNLESS Ukraine is joining NATO. But this is 0% probability at this point though it is possible later. Besides, there is no need to win an election: United Russia is on the way to power (again) in September.  What about that Ukraine tries to get Donbass back? Military parade in Kiev recently is considered as evidence for that. But there was an attempt before and while the civilian causalties were high, they still may not reach 1000 for this year. Besides, the West who controls aid (military aid included) does not have any intention for that to happen. What about some black swans? Not connected to Donbass?  Assassination of Putin, which will be blamed on Ukranians/CIA (like murder of Nemtsov illogically blamed on his young Ukrainian lover). Putin is not Nemtsov or even American President.Much less than 1% probability IMHO  Like nationalistic (or pro-Russian) coup in Kiev?

In 2015 Erdogan hosted Tatar leaders in Turkey, expressing his solidarity with the Tatar people and vowing never to recognize Moscow\u2019s illegal annexation.\"\n1: https://themoscowtimes.com/articles/escalation-in-crimea-threatens-turkey-russia-rapprochement-55026"], [691, "2016-08-24T20:44:49Z", [0.02], ""], [1262, "2016-08-24T18:43:26Z", [0.01], "There would be no advantage to either side were this to occur "], [368, "2016-08-24T17:15:06Z", [0.0], ""], [6552, "2016-08-24T17:01:00Z", [0.02], "While the chance for conflict is high, it is unlikely that it shall lead to anything that falls under the definition of \"mass killing\"."], [12879, "2016-08-24T16:41:32Z", [0.05], ""], [15548, "2016-08-24T15:44:38Z", [0.02], ""], [1333, "2016-08-24T15:16:35Z", [0.45], "http://www.intellinews.com/ukraine-s-poroshenko-threatens-to-impose-martial-law-if-situation-in-east-deteriorates-104324/?inf_contact_key=4249c7414f0909bf20bf390d32ba0f2d6cfee6a0da0fb3f9d21aead4b06c8cd0"], [283, "2016-08-24T13:23:59Z", [0.1], ""], [28414, "2016-08-24T12:42:07Z", [0.05], ""], [19801, "2016-08-24T11:08:38Z", [0.1], "Current death from the conflict is too low to meet the 1 000 deaths threshold.\nhttps://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/309848"], [23549, "2016-08-24T09:50:14Z", [0.0], ""], [10759, "2016-08-24T09:21:47Z", [0.05], ""], [4634, "2016-08-24T09:21:39Z", [0.05], ""], [15196, "2016-08-24T03:37:39Z", [0.0], ""], [90, "2016-08-24T02:04:18Z", [0.09], ""], [20284, "2016-08-23T23:47:03Z", [0.1], "I do not believe that Russia will want the Ukraine to become an issue in the remainder of 2016.

Also, I am happy about the fact that this question is being asked. Right now the conflict in Ukraine is a civil war (with external players obv.; at least Russia) and as such per se it doesn't really fall into the focus of the mass atrocity crimes - community. I do not have any particular good insight into the situation in Ukraine. I recently looked up the numbers to check in on the situation:  Since April 2014 over 9.500 people have been killed during the fighting in Eastern Ukraine. This includes civilians and fighters of all sides. In June 2016 over twelve civilians have been killed - according to the UN, this is the highest number recorded per month since August 2015. So the overall number should actually be rather low (around 100?). This says nothing about whether they have been targeted or been killed by mistake. For now I assume that the vast majority of civilian deaths will have to get coded as collateral damage -hence, my 0 forecast. However, this is my initial forecast. I am happy if anyone corrects me on this. I know nothing about the local groups.
