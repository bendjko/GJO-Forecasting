The House is expected to vote Wednesday evening on the deal. If it passes, the Senate could begin work as early as Thursday. Congressional leaders used a tax bill that already passed the House as the vehicle for the agreement in order to speed up the procedural process in the Senate. Presidential candidate Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said Tuesday that he plans to filibuster the bill, but his chances of slowing down passage are limited. The agreement will have to clear one procedural hurdle with at least 60 votes before it can be approved by a simple majority.

Both the Republicans and their Tea Party compatriots both have some agenda items that do not allow compromise at all.  This makes governing difficult.  It is either their way or no way.  Real Republicans have agenda items they want that do not discount what Democrats want for all people.  Republicans are mostly interested in maintaining or gaining more political power.  However, if they attempt to shut down the government, they risk losing those independent voters and republicans whose jobs depend on the government (military, schools, bureaucracy, etc.).

House Republicans on Wednesday plan to pass legislation not to avert disaster, but rather to manage it, channeling daily tax collections to the nation\u2019s creditors and Social Security recipients if the government\u2019s borrowing limit is not lifted. \"The Obama administration and nonpartisan authorities say the plan is unworkable, but efficacy may be beside the point: Republican leaders appear to be buying time to find enough members of their own party to join Democrats in supporting an increase or suspension of the statutory debt limit by the Nov. 3 deadline so the nation can borrow to pay its bills \u2014 all of them \u2014 without a market-shaking crisis. \"The challenge is daunting. The risk of the nation\u2019s first default has increased along with the numbers of Tea Party Republicans who have entered Congress, many of them pledged to oppose any debt-limit increase.  . . .\n . . .\n\"The House last raised the federal debt ceiling in February 2014, by a vote of 221 to 201, with only 28 Republicans and all but two Democrats voting yes. The landscape has grown more complicated since then, with 22 freshman Republicans in seats held last year by members who voted to raise the debt ceiling.

When Congress last voted in February 2014 to suspend the debt limit, 28 House Republicans joined nearly all Democrats in support; 199 Republicans were opposed. Now there are fewer Democrats in the House and if all 188 of them voted for an increase, Republican leaders would need 30 votes from their side for a 218-vote majority \u2014 two more than last year. \"Yet nine of last year\u2019s 28 Republican supporters have left Congress and at least three of their Republican successors \u2014 Representatives Dave Brat of Virginia, Steve Knight of California and Mark Walker, Republican of North Carolina \u2014 are almost certain to be opposed. \"Also, 14 Democrats who voted to increase the debt limit are gone, replaced by Republicans, some of whom are likely to vote no. \u201cYou have got to be able to say that something is big enough that you would shut down the government,\u201d Mr. Knight told a California radio station on Friday. Mr. Knight, who replaced Howard McKeon, a Republican supporter of the last debt-ceiling increase, added, \u201cWe have got to stop digging at some point and make people understand that we have got to have a balanced budget that works on knocking down the deficit, or our children are going to have a much, much different country.\u201d \"Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the majority leader, told reporters on Tuesday that he did not think a debt-ceiling increase could pass the House without significant spending cuts attached, a deal President Obama has repeatedly said he will not negotiate. \"Chris Krueger of Guggenheim Securities, the Washington analyst who this week warned clients of the hazards ahead, predicted that the borrowing limit would be lifted. \u201cBut we are basing that on nothing more than blind faith,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cTo the best of our knowledge, the Treasury has never been in such a difficult position going into a debt ceiling showdown with Congress.\u201d\n. . . \n\"Leaders of the Republican-controlled Congress had long expected a December deadline. Now, facing the need for expedited action, they are beset by chaos. Hard-line conservatives pressed Speaker John A. Boehner to announce his resignation, leaving the party openly at war over a successor. Those same conservatives, the roughly 40 members of the House Freedom Caucus, are emboldened to force the kind of debt-limit confrontation with Mr. Obama that they say Mr. Boehner shied away from. \u201cIt\u2019s a three-ring circus over there,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Senate\u2019s No. 3 Democrat, \u201cwhich you might laugh at, except the consequences are so serious.\u201d \"A separate coalition of conservatives that includes most House Republicans, the Republican Study Committee, on Tuesday outlined conditions it would demand that Mr. Obama meet.

The leaders of the house & senate Republicans apparently met with Obama to discuss a budget deal.  The D's thought there was an agreement to keep the meeting secret, but the R's have revealed it.  \"Just like that, the fall\u2019s high-stakes budget talks are off to a rough start. \"In the aftermath, senior staffers in Reid and McConnell\u2019s office pointed fingers at each other and an air of mistrust poured into a Capitol already riven by a chaotic leadership election in the House and bitter partisanship in the Senate. . . . \n. . . \n\" . . . the incident certainly didn\u2019t help the early budget deliberations, which began in earnest last week when GOP and Democratic staffers huddled at the White House to begin negotiations after Congress passed a 10-week stopgap spending bill.  \"With Boehner\u2019s sudden resignation leaving a power vacuum at the top of the House, and lingering questions about Obama\u2019s ability to sway Hill votes, a final deal will likely hinge on whether Reid and McConnell can put the past few months of parliamentary warfare behind them to keep the government funded for the next two years. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be a tall order,\u201d said Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) when asked if McConnell and Reid can come together. \u201cI would say it\u2019s still a challenging relationship,\u201d Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas), McConnell\u2019s top deputy, said of the two leaders. Reid is \u201ca tough guy and he plays hardball.\u201d \". . . No deal can be made without Reid and Pelosi\u2019s assent, given that Republicans don\u2019t hold enough Senate seats to muscle a budget deal through, and House GOP leaders haven\u2019t been able to pass major spending deals without Democratic help. And, they added, Reid and Pelosi were fully aware of the GOP\u2019s talks with the president. \"There are incentives for both parties to avoid budget brinkmanship during a presidential election. Plus, continuing resolutions are considered bad governance by many senior lawmakers, given that they keep old spending laws in place and don\u2019t allow Congress to adjust priorities. Influential Democrats and Republicans have already said they won\u2019t vote for yet another fiscal punt in December. \"But senators in both parties expressed some concern that the early elbow throwing could stymie a broad budget agreement between the two Senate leaders. \"The relationship is \u201cabout where it\u2019s been for a long time: It has its moments of productivity, and a long history of differences over some fundamental issues and how to run the Senate,\u201d said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, Reid\u2019s No. 2.\n. . . \n\"Sources close to the leaders privately said their relationship has always been tense and seems to be getting worse . . . \"Neither is known for being chummy, and beyond brief private talks on the floor preceding their often bitterly partisan speeches there\u2019s little day to day contact between the two . . . \n. . . \n\"Their working relationship on the floor has been in a deep freeze for years.\n. . .\n\u201cThey give the same speech every morning. Always about how bad the other is,\u201d lamented one Republican senator. Asked how much of that is for show, the senator replied: \u201cAll of it \u2026 they\u2019ll both cut a deal.\u201d \"Both leaders consider themselves pragmatists at heart. . . .\n. . .\n\"McConnell, a dispassionate tactician who\u2019s been able to strike key fiscal deals with Vice President Joe Biden, sees the White House as more of an honest broker than Reid in a major negotiation like a two-year budget blueprint. \"To McConnell loyalists, working with Reid just invites drama. They view him as someone who fights his battles in the press and with over-the-top insults, a turnoff for the taciturn and calculating GOP leader. \u201cI\u2019m sure that with fewer people you have in the room, the more serious the negotiations and discussion, and in a quicker way,\u201d said South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the third-ranking Senate Republican.\n. . .\n\"Already, some red lines are being drawn: McConnell will demand that any bump-ups to existing spending caps be offset with savings elsewhere. He won\u2019t accept tax hikes to pay for them, although other revenue-raisers such as fee increases could be an option.\n. . . \n\u201cThe question is what he\u2019s promised these 40 off-the-deep end guys.  . . . It\u2019s hard to see how things get better with Boehner leaving.\u201d \"Democrats, for their part, are demanding domestic spending increases, which some hawkish Republicans are willing to accept in exchange for more money for the Pentagon that was slashed under a 2011 deficit-reduction deal. But many fiscal conservatives in the Capitol are happy with the lower budget caps for both domestic and defense \u2013 spending limits from the Budget Control Act that McConnell has regularly touted with pride as one of his big achievements. \"Still, many senators are already sounding this refrain: No more stopgap continuing resolutions. . . . McCain (R-Ariz.) said he has \u201cvoted for my last CR,\u201d angrily adding: \u201cI will not stand by and watch our military be destroyed.\u201d Durbin said he wouldn\u2019t support another continuing resolution either: That would be a \u201cdisaster.\u201d \"McConnell\u2019s allies say Reid is largely to blame for the frosty relationship, noting that the minority leader has blockaded key measures such as annual appropriations bills. Republicans were guilty of similar tactics in the minority. \"Democrats have said their confrontational procedural posture is meant to push Republicans to negotiate on a broader budget deal that boosts both domestic and defense spending sooner rather than later. But that strategy has frustrated Republicans, who\u2019ve instead forced Democrats to vote on the same bills over and over \u2013 to no avail. It took a government shutdown threat last week to get everyone at the table. \"The Senate GOP leadership says it has occasional success in maneuvering around Reid by finding other Democratic partners, such as Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) on a highway bill and Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) on trade policy.\nBut when Reid gets all his members on board, \u201cWe\u2019ve been stuck,\u201d Cornyn said.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  My 2 take-aways from this are:  \u201cThey give the same speech every morning.

I'm not reading that anymore.  The tone of the commentaries has grown very dark, suggesting that government dysfunction will be even worse after Boehner leaves.  The silver lining in Boehner's announced retirement is now being described as a determination to pass as much legislation as possible while he is still in the House.  So, much depends on what happens in the next couple of hours, days & weeks.
