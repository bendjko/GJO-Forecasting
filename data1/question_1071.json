The definition that we are under for genocide in this definition is there needs to be 1000 deaths from the state or more. So, as of right now, they don't have the numbers for this to happen.   However, in the last month, things seem to be changing. there has been a spike of riots and protests over the last month.  Against the current president of Sudan, Omar al-Bashir. So the question is, why would Bashir carry out a genocide now, and why has he not before? Well the answer is, to protect his position in the highest office in Sudan. And how many people have to be killed to protect his office or in the ruling party?  And how many institutions have to be toppled for the genocide to continue or happen.  Why are the people rioting now? Because of food shortages? Why is there a food shortage? I'm not sure yet, I am still in class.  The people who are being killed on a larger scale, are happening in Central Darfur, which is not close to the Capital of Sudan.
