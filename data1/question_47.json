The author of this article makes the case that the reduced margins (if true) will be a result of product mix. I have suggested that reduced margins are also a natural result of \"channel promotions\" (pricing discounts, etc.), and looking forward, \"channel maintenance\" expenses. The critical issue, beside of course the underlying end-user demand, is the lead time required for Apple to go from initial order to finished unit ready-for-sale to delivered unit.

I've always assumed it was at least thirty days, and that, no matter what, Apple would be certain to have whatever inventory was required to make the quarterly unit number, if demand should materialize, assembled and ready-to-go.

It would also be interesting to get more data (although I wasn't able to find much information more specific than this: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/mobile-phones/11812322/smartphone-sales-in-china-fall-says-gartner.html) on how sales might be impacted by the economic slowdown in China, a huge market for Apple's iPhone products."], [691, "2016-01-19T18:15:54Z", [0.47], ""], [15548, "2016-01-19T17:46:02Z", [0.3], "Moving from 40 to 30\nhttp://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Trends/Parts-makers-brace-for-iPhone-production-cut"], [15937, "2016-01-19T17:07:32Z", [0.3], ""], [15980, "2016-01-19T16:00:58Z", [0.65], ""], [10612, "2016-01-19T15:15:05Z", [0.78], ""], [2, "2016-01-19T14:58:55Z", [0.6], ""], [2, "2016-01-19T14:58:06Z", [0.65], ""], [498, "2016-01-19T12:42:02Z", [1.0], "\"Despite widespread talk about declining iPhone orders and a \"tough comparison\" quarter that cannot hope to beat last year's December quarter, the consensus from analysts now is that Apple will, as it guided, break the record.\"\nhttps://www.macnn.com/articles/16/01/18/apples.homepage.offers.quote.from.civil.rights.leader.on.federal.holiday.132079/ While \"breaking the record\" isn't enough (we need an approximately 0.67% increase), I'm recalling my \"linguistic analysis\" of Tim Cook's words of guidance (which I interpreted to equate to at least 1.00% growth), plus I'm so far in, I might as well go all the way.\nhttps://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/28966"], [15951, "2016-01-19T08:52:19Z", [0.34], ""], [14270, "2016-01-19T03:09:01Z", [0.6], "Tried to fit the data from 2011 to this year to two models: the quadratic and the exponential.

Still, as a \"seat of the pants\" forecaster, I'm less optimistic. Apple is Apple, so I'm staying in the\" more likely than not range\" but I think two factors may be significant when comparing this year's growth with last year\n1) Though 13 million phones were sold in the first three days, the first two days' sales were included in Apple's fourth quarter, unlike last year. If that's the case, the 48.05 million phones sold in 4Q15 should be reduced by 8-9 million ie. two thirds of 13 million, when comparing growth with 4Q14.\n2) China was not among the markets in the first weekend for the 6 last year, but the 6s and Plus were sold in China from the start this year. It seems something like 3-4 million of these were sold in China on the first weekend this year, so these numbers should also be taken out from the 48.05 figure for a comparison with the previous year. Taking the two above, a conservative \"apple to apple\" (sorry but can't resist) comparison should have 4Q15 as no more than 40 million compared to the 39.27 of 4Q14.   Gordonei's second approach, applying the geometric mean of the previous several years growth, would lead to a result less than 75 million if the figure of 48.02 was replaced by about 43 or less. As suggested by the two points above, this substitution seems quite reasonable to me. I'm not competent to review Gordonei's first approach, the \"German Tank\" model, except that small differences in some of the ratios could change the result significantly since the \"Country Muliplier\" is fairly large at 27.745. If this was 25 then the total calculated would be under 75 million again i.e. if UK's share was 4.0% instead of the calculated 3.6%.

To reach 75, a jump of +27 million is needed.\nAnother view though, is they only need to sell 500,000 more 6S units than 6.

I don't see them cutting this expenditure out unless absolutely necessary. This will still have incremental impact, though.\n- 12% Against: 6S isn't much of an improvement from the 6.\nThe excitement for 6 vs 5S was huge, and can be seen in the +35million unit Q4-Q1 jump. 6S doesn't seem to have this bump.\n- 5% Against: So many 6's were sold that people might not need to change phones after 1 short year.\nover 230 million iPhone 6's were sold, 62 million more than 5S. \n- mitigating factor is that historically, that hasn't mattered as Apple simply expands the pie to new buyers.\n-5% For: Apple seems to think their revenue will grow to $75.5B from $74.6B. Since Apple has historically always lowballed their revenue projections, it's not unlikely for revenue to be $78B. That extra $3.4B can only come from iPhone sales - none of the other units can move the needle that much. So internally, it looks like they are expecting something like 76 million units. This is probably based on the sell-through rate of the 6S after release.\n+80% So it's much closer to call than at first blush, but I think they will just barely make it, and I have to put the odds at 60/40.

Assuming that most of the new phones sold would be the new ones, i.e. iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Pluses, I used serial numbers off eBay in the UK (from product photos) to work out how many phones there were approximately in the country. I then found the worldwide number of 6Ss, using the market share of Apple in the UK relative to the world and the smartphone market size of the UK, relative to the world. Then, I used the released sales figures for Q4 2015 to account for those that were sold in that quarter. Finally, I used a linear projection to work out, based upon the number of phones sold so far in this quarter, the total for Q1 2016, which I project to be 82.4 million phones. This of course ignores Christmas, which I might have to revisit in the future. Another, less interesting way (in my opinion i.e. no less valid), is to look at what happens to sales in the quarter after Apple releases a new phone internationally (i.e. from the iPhone 3GS onwards). In more recent years this has always neatly been at the end of the 4th quarter (i.e. the one before December), but in previous years this has been more towards the beginning of a quarter. Looking at the geometric mean of the factor difference between the quarter where most of the new sales occurs and previous one, there is projected to be 82.9 million phones sold in Q1 2016. Both methods are pretty conclusively above 75 million, although the standard deviation on the Bayesian method is considerable - I need to crunch the stats properly to quantify it, but it looks to be roughly a 10% chance it'll be below 75M.

Historically, Q1s have always been high growth quarters, profiting from increased consumer expenditure over the holidays. In recent years we have seen QoQ growth figures ranging from 51% to 90%. Assuming in-line growth figures of ~70%, we would see 82m units sold in FY16Q1. It is also imperative to note that we would need to see QoQ growth at the bottom of the range at <56% to come in at less than 75m units sold.\nFor this model I will assume QoQ growth of 60%, putting unit sales at 77m. Examining YoY growth figures for recent quarters we see a general downwards trend with the highest figure from FY15Q1 at 46% YoY growth and FY15Q4 at the bottom of the range with 22%. Assuming the trend continues, we will see roughly 17% YoY growth in FY16Q1. I will assume a more conservative 15%, which would see unit sales of 86m. In order to follow the slowing YoY growth trend, I have decided to weight expected YoY growth at 60%, while using the remaining 40% to account for the seasonal Q1 \"pop\" in sales figures. Hence, using unit sales implied by the YoY growth trend as a baseline (86m units) and adjusting downwards as we incorporate a conservative Q1 pop (77m), my estimate would put FY16Q1 iPhone unit sales at about 82m, with significant upside potential. As even the most conservative component implies more than 75m units shipped, I adjust my forecast upwards to 90%.\n\nUpside risks: Reversal of YoY growth trend, bigger than expected Q1 pop, positive demand drivers (Rose Gold, Apple Upgrade Program, Force Touch), positive demand shocks (higher consumer spending, lower than expected economic slowdown in key markets) Downside risks: Change in seasonal consumption pattern (absorption of Q1 sales into Q4), negative economic shocks (slowdown in key markets), stronger than expected YoY growth slowdown Sources:\nhttp://investor.apple.com/results.cfm\nhttp://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-earnings-lifted-by-iphone-sales-in-china-1445977904"], [4634, "2015-10-28T12:17:34Z", [0.75], "Apple's guidance seems to imply that Q1 2016 will be record-breaking.

On the other hand, when an operating officer delivers an estimate, there is at least the assurance that they are in a position to manipulate the *actual performance* of the result.

Slower adoption rates may mean that it Apple can't meet the loft expectations of 75-80 million iPhone sales. Also I came across another article that discusses how frequently iphones are traded in.

Lowering of orders from suppliers is another leading indicator that fewer iPhones are likely to be sold. However, there is still a possibility that a high number of purchasers within the last year will upgrade their phone to the newest version.

Firstly, it's just one analysis of the situation from a firm with a track record that I can't find out.

It's all relative; so if Apple's initial expectations and component orders were for iPhone sales of say 80m, then below expectations or \"disappointing sales\" might not mean sales will fall below 75m. His sources might have been similarly vague about describing sales. How does he calculate an estimate of 67m units?\nIn terms of what he says about fewer stores selling out of iPhones, as I recall, last year's iPhone release had supply issues considering demand beat expectations (quick search gives 71.5m) and also issues with manufacturing the 6 Plus' larger screen.\nOn the final point, that \u201calmost all carriers surveyed indicated that iPhone 6s sales were down y/y, compared to the iPhone 6.\u201d, I'm assuming he's referring to US carriers.

There are 50+million that are set to have their contract expire. 50% would mean an additional 25 million looking to upgrade. The iPhone fell to number 3 in China and demand over there has been rough.

Economic downturns in high growth countries such as China are also increasing the downside.

Whereas for the iPhone 6S, the release date (25th September) has just been two days before the beginning of the first quarter. Considering how many iPhones Apple sells, iPhone 6 sales would've easily passed 75m units if it had been released a few days closer to the first quarter, which means the 6S will pretty easily pass 75m even if demand doesn't rise. Also, this article that the Good Judgment people posted http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/09/18/2-iphone-numbers-apple-investors-need-to-know.aspx makes a pretty good point about how the iPhone 6 will be $100 cheaper and as such, the first discounted large iPhone.

Analysts estimate that sales increased 5-10% above last year excluding China (versus something like 30% when China is included; but China will be selling it for more months in the quarter now).
