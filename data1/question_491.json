[edit: from the FAQ:\n17. The question asks about a policy change. How does GJ handle situations in which policy changes are reversed or overturned? When a question asks about an 'announcement', legal actions subsequent to the announcement occurrence (e.g. actions by a court) do not affect the resolution of a question. When a question asks about a law, policy, order, or similar act of a legal nature going into effect, subsequent legal actions (including, but not limited to, actions by a court) will only affect the resolution of the question if the subsequent legal actions prevent the act of a legal nature from taking effect. For instance, if a question asks about whether or not a piece of legislation will become law, that legislation becoming law would close the question irrespective of an injunction being granted by a court to prevent further enforcement of that law. However, if a question asks about a policy change and an executive order is signed which makes that change but an injunction is granted before the change takes effect, the question would not resolve.]"], [1333, "2017-11-22T14:26:09Z", [0.05], "They're going to pussy foot around with the issue and strip Net Neutrality rules before abandoning it all together.

Comcast Corp., for instance, said in its reply comments filed Aug. 30 that the record contains \"numerous economic submissions that painstakingly document the various harms\" of the FCC's current regulatory approach to broadband. In 2015, the FCC adopted the Open Internet Order, which classified broadband as a Title II service under the Communications Act. The reclassification made broadband subject to more stringent common carrier regulatory authority, enabling the FCC to enforce its net neutrality rules against blocking, throttling and paid prioritization. Comcast pointed to papers from more than a dozen economists submitted as part of the proceeding showing the current Title II classification has generated \"tremendous regulatory uncertainty\" for broadband service providers, directly undercutting incentives to innovate and invest in broadband networks. \"These new economist papers leave no doubt about the deleterious impact of Title II on broadband investment,\" Comcast said in its filing. But the Internet Association \u2014 a trade group and lobbying organization that represents new media companies such as Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Facebook Inc., Netflix Inc. and Twitter Inc. \u2014 took a different view. The group argued in its reply comments the economic studies submitted by the economists associated with internet service providers \"do not present any new empirical evidence regarding any negative economic impact of the 2015 Order\" and instead rely on \"the same incomplete and questionable empirical studies\" cited initially by the FCC in its own notice of proposed rulemaking. All in all, the association said, the record provides \"no policy or economic justification\" for overturning the 2015 Open Internet Order just two years after it went into effect. While these groups were divided on what the record shows in terms of the impact of the Title II classification, they were united in their support for potentially preserving some degree of net neutrality protections. In a blog post about the company's FCC filing, Comcast Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Diversity Officer David Cohen noted the cable operator supports \"permanent, strong, legally enforceable net neutrality rules,\" adding that Comcast pledges to \"not block, throttle, or discriminate against lawful content, no matter what the FCC does.\" Verizon Communications Inc. similarly noted in its reply comments, \"An open Internet is good for consumers and good for our business,\" adding that there is substantial agreement that \"consumers should be able to access the legal content of their choice when and how they want.\" Both Comcast and Verizon believe the best path forward is for Congress to enact legislation permanently codifying key protections. SNL Image\nUntil such legislation can be adopted, Comcast said the FCC has multiple options available for preserving a free and open internet, noting the record shows \"numerous parties support the use of Section 706 to establish bright-line rules.\" Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act requires the FCC to promote broadband in the U.S., and the FCC previously tried to use its authority under Section 706 to adopt open internet rules without reclassifying broadband as a Title II service. Yet the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit struck down key elements of the rules, arguing Section 706 does not give the commission authority to enforce common carrier regulations on noncommon carriage services. Thus, in 2015, the commission reclassified broadband and made it subject to the more stringent common carrier authority. But according to Comcast, the D.C. Circuit Court's 2014 decision left open another path. Although common carrier mandates were a bridge too far, the court \"clarified that the Commission may use Section 706 to adopt open Internet safeguards,\" Comcast said, adding that in this way, \"Section 706 represents a judicially validated path forward for establishing effective open Internet rules.\" Verizon, which had been at the center of the legal challenge in the 2014 case, agreed saying Section 706 provides the commission with the necessary authority to address open internet issues. Comcast and Verizon further noted the FCC has yet another option: it can rely on the Federal Trade Commission to enforce public commitments from ISPs not to block or throttle content. Quoting Acting FTC Chairman Maureen Ohlhausen, Verizon said many of the tenets of net neutrality regulation \"fall within one or more \u2026 categories of anti-competitive actions and therefore could be addressed by the FTC's antitrust enforcement.\" The Internet Association, though, said relying on the FTC to enforce voluntary industry commitments would be a mistake. \"Disputes involving open internet rules will likely involve technical questions that only the FCC has the requisite experience and expertise to analyze adequately,\" the group said. With the reply comment period now closed, the FCC will begin reviewing the totality of the record. If Commission Chairman Ajit Pai decides to move forward with a report and order, he will circulate his proposed rules to his fellow commissioners \u2014 and likely the public \u2014 at least three weeks prior to any vote that may occur.\" Confirmation by Senate of Pai occurs 100% he is bullet proof for years\nnext 3 week notice\ncommon carrier gone b 4 Thanksgiving"], [14777, "2017-09-27T14:00:45Z", [0.36], ""], [38505, "2017-09-26T21:51:15Z", [0.15], ""], [691, "2017-09-26T19:57:28Z", [0.12], ""], [601, "2017-09-26T16:24:22Z", [0.4], ""], [691, "2017-09-25T18:28:56Z", [0.14], ""], [2965, "2017-09-25T05:41:58Z", [1.0], ""], [691, "2017-09-25T01:15:24Z", [0.16], ""], [4918, "2017-09-24T21:05:57Z", [0.45], ""], [948, "2017-09-24T14:20:11Z", [0.05], "I continue to believe the timeframe on this is against a yes answer."], [35618, "2017-09-24T01:54:06Z", [0.5], ""], [691, "2017-09-23T12:54:40Z", [0.18], ""], [40094, "2017-09-23T08:47:49Z", [0.0], ""], [35636, "2017-09-23T03:52:51Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-09-22T20:55:07Z", [0.2], ""], [691, "2017-09-21T22:56:41Z", [0.2], ""], [39928, "2017-09-21T21:39:54Z", [0.1], ""], [39781, "2017-09-21T21:12:26Z", [0.2], ""], [39816, "2017-09-21T18:29:51Z", [0.45], ""], [39816, "2017-09-21T18:28:48Z", [0.1], ""], [14777, "2017-09-21T16:30:16Z", [0.4], ""], [3, "2017-09-21T04:35:17Z", [0.25], "Dropping a bit more for passage of time w/out FCC action + a new lawsuit re \"fake\" comments that could further delay any ruling.

That schedule alone would make it challenging - but not impossible - for the FCC to unravel current net neutrality rules prior to 1 January 2018. (I say \"not impossible\" because I suspect that the FCC Chair has the votes he needs in hand and that a ruling to that effect may even have been drafted prior to the filing of opening comments, leaving only the task of inserting summaries of the opening and reply comments to be done after August 16th.) But, Fortune (http://fortune.com/2017/07/17/net-neutrality-fake-comments-fcc/) quotes the President of the National Legal and Policy Center as claiming that at least 1.3 MILLION fake comments were filed on July 17th. The irony here is that the group he represents is opposed to net neutrality rules, but that raising doubts about the legitimacy of the public comment process may actually create a procedural mess that will delay the FCC's ability to act on the NPRM's proposed elimination of net neutrality rules! Meanwhile, the Democrats' recently announced \"Better Deal\" platform has a heavy emphasis on improving competitiveness in the cable and telco industries (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/07/24/democrats-are-slamming-cable-and-telecom-companies-in-their-new-better-deal-platform/). Is there the slightest chance that the Dems (or even the John Oliver effect) will influence the FCC's decision? Pretty slight, IMHO (p<.05). But, the Dems' platform reflects the broad unpopularity of cable and telco providers. Where public policy battles pit an unpopular industry group against another powerful lobby (in this case, net neutrality advocates from Silicon Valley and beyond, such as Netflix), it's less obvious where the administration's pro-business preferences will land. FCC Chair Pai may find that his policy push has less backing from the Oval Office than he expected. Overall, the odds favor delay past January 1st.

THE FULL NET NEUTRALITY PROPOSAL WILL BE REVEALED THURSDAY\nHis proposal will do three things: first, it\u2019ll reclassify internet providers as Title I information services; second, it\u2019ll prevent the FCC from adapting any net neutrality rules to practices that internet providers haven\u2019t thought up yet; and third, it\u2019ll open questions about what to do with several key net neutrality rules \u2014 like no blocking or throttling of apps and websites \u2014 that were implemented in 2015. Pai said the full text of his net neutrality proposal would be published tomorrow afternoon. It\u2019ll be voted on by the FCC at a meeting on May 18th. From there, months of debate will follow as the item is opened up for public comment. The commission will then revise its rules based on the feedback it receives before taking a final vote to enact them. Strong net neutrality rules were passed in 2015 and have been in place for about two years. Those rules reclassified internet providers as \u201ccommon carriers\u201d under Title II of the Telecommunications Act, which subject them to tough, utility-style regulation.
