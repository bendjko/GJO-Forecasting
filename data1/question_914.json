Even accounting for historical trends including fairly brutal weeks where 112 people were killed in 2017, data points like that are outliers compared to the norm. IE: that type of attack hasn't occurred since.\nTherefore it's my opinion that unless there's a coup/revolution which is unforeseen at this time, history doesn't suggest that this many civilians will be killed.\nNote, the death tolls of Pakistan is well above 1000/year. But the causes, once extrapolated, don't show the systematic killing of those civilians is statistically significant.
