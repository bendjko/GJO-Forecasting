The Energy Information Administration said Wednesday morning U.S. stockpiles of crude oil fell by 5.9 million barrels last week, compared with analysts\u2019 expectations for a 2.5 million-barrel decline. That puts total U.S. commercial crude oil stockpiles at 427 million barrels, the lowest level since March (Para. 3). While the headline number on oil inventories from Wednesday\u2019s weekly EIA report was bullish, the data also included some bearish figures. Stockpiles of gasoline and distillates rose by 3.3 million barrels and 2.7 million barrels, respectively, offsetting the 5.9-million-barrel drop in crude stockpiles (Para.10). Also, motor gasoline supplied to the market\u2014which investors use as a proxy for demand\u2014fell by 553,000 barrels a day last week, to 9.3 million barrels a day, suggesting summer driving demand may not be quite as robust as forecast (Para. 14).

Based on today's price, the buckets are: \n* Price falls by more than 10.7% \n* Price falls by 10.6% to 4.3% \n* Price falls by less than 4.3% or rises by less than 2.1% \n* Price increases by 2.1% to 8.5% \n* Price increases by more than 8.5% Given the very similar question about gold prices (https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/736474), I just note how much more volatile oil prices are than gold.  The \"buckets\" for answers are much wider for this question (in percentage terms) but, even so, extremes of price movements are far more common for oil than for gold. In fact, a question like \"Will the oil price change by MORE than $5 per barrel (in either direction)?\" is pretty much a 50:50 proposition.  In short, it is highly likely to change, but no-one can usefully forecast in which direction.

U.S. crude futures rose 35 cents, or 0.5%, to $71.31 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent, the global benchmark, rose 20 cents, or 0.3%, to $78.43 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe, the highest since November 2014. Oil prices have run up rapidly amid turmoil in the Middle East and the prospect of trade sanctions against Iran. Both benchmarks are up around 4% this month. They both pulled back from highs reached in earlier trading Tuesday as the dollar surged and equity markets fell, but still ended the day higher. Oil and the dollar often move in opposite directions, since a stronger dollar makes oil more expensive for buyers using foreign currencies, reducing demand (Para. 1-3). Sider, A. & Salvaterra, N.

More recently, prices have been bolstered by President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to pull the U.S. out of a 2015 international agreement to curb Iran\u2019s nuclear program. The move is set to reimpose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran, hindering the oil output of the Islamic Republic\u2014a major OPEC member\u2014and reducing global supply. However, Saudi Arabia has already indicated it could ramp up its own production to make up for any supply loss from Iran (Para. 6). Alessi, C. (2018).
