Roxas has led two D'Strafford polls, but the outfit seems awfully sketchy (http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2016/05/tp-investigates-survey-firm-dstrafford.html). Additionally, we can check for favouritism by seeing if the same Liberal Party skew is present in the firm's VP polling. Leni Roberedo, the Liberal VP candidate, scored 32% and 34% in D'Strafford's two most recent polls. The first result is 10% higher than the average of three preceding polls and the latter 8% above the three preceding polls.  My conclusion: D'Strafford's results are garbage and should be ignored. The most recent SWS poll found 10% undecided, but barring a collapse by either supporters of Roxas or Poe toward the other (ideologically similar) candidate, that won't be enough to give the election to anyone other than Duterte.

It does, however, also ask voters about how committed they are to their candidate and found that fully one-third of Duterte's voters are open to changing their minds.  I'm torn in how to project this, but I've made the following adjustments:\n- Reduced Binay's likelihood to just 2% from 10%. The last two polls show him collapsing, and it would appear his voters are shuffling over to Duterte. I don't feel comfortable writing him off completely as he was just three points back of the lead in a poll from two weeks ago, but it doesn't look good.\n- Raised Roxas from 5% to 11%. I don't totally trust the D'Strafford poll because it seems like such an outlier, but I've been expecting voters to migrate from Roxas to Poe and it keeps not happening. He came in at 19% in the SWS survey and has polled between 18% and 26% in all but one poll since the end of January. A good showing in April 24's presidential debate might put him over the top. \n- I have Poe and Duterte in a near-dead heat, at 45% and 42%, respectively. I don't trust Duterte's support to be real - the D'Strafford numbers suggest that it's soft and after three polls topping 30% he's come in below that number in two of the last three. Poe, meanwhile, is holding steady at the same 25-26% support she's been polling at since January.

The matter is getting a lot of international coverage.  http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/17/philippines-presidential-candidate-attacked-over-remarks"], [24028, "2016-04-19T02:46:28Z", [0.05, 0.0, 0.45, 0.45, 0.05, 0.0], "First draft."], [94, "2016-04-19T02:43:50Z", [0.05, 0.01, 0.45, 0.47, 0.01, 0.01], ""], [20739, "2016-04-19T02:19:54Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.3, 0.7, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [23879, "2016-04-19T01:49:11Z", [0.05, 0.0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.05, 0.0], "I started not knowing the first thing about politics in the Philippines. First I looked at how past elections went. As it turns out, parties in the Philippines are usually short-lived, as alliances form and dissolve. Among the 5 running candidates, we have [1]: * Roxas, Liberal party, social liberalism / center-left, founded in 1946\n* Poe, independent, part of the Galing at Puso coalition, center to center-right, founded in 2015\n* Duterte, PDP-Laban, left-wing populism / center-left, founded in 1982\n* Santiago, PRP, reformism / center-left, founded in 1991\n* Binay, UNA, compassionate conservatism / center-right, founded in 2012 Looking through the list of past presidents [2] we get a base rate of 67% for center-right parties and 33% of center-left parties (the latter is all represented by the Liberal party). Social conservatism (in the form of nationalism and Christian right) seems to dominate the center-right scene. I was even getting into what parties formed from the dissolution of which [3] when I decided this was taking too long and decided to look at the polls. Before I did, I had a base rate of 67% for Binay (apparently the only center-right candidate) and 16% each for Santiago and Roxas, since both of them had brushes with the presidency (Roxas is in the incumbent party, Santiago came very close to being elected president in 1992). The polls threw all that out the window [4]. Roxas, Binay and Santiago are all but sure to lose, consistently coming in behind everyone else. Essentially only Poe and Duterte seem to have a shot. With a bit more googling I found that Poe, although independent, is in a center/center-right coaltion. So I decided I would give 5% each to Roxas & Binay, and the remaining 90% I would split between Duterte & Poe according to my center-right/center-left base rate. That gives 2/3 of 90% to Poe (so 60%) and 1/3 of 90% to Duterte (so 30%). I don't feel very confident in these predictions. For all I know, politics in the Philippines might be driven by different dimensions than right/left. But this is what I've got.

I don't have any insight into how the court will rule, but I do note that six of the 15 judges were appointed by political ally (and current president) Benigno Aquino, while the other nine were appointed by Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, who defeated Poe's father in the 2004 presidential election. \nI'm guessing here that it's 60/40 they rule Poe ineligible, strictly on that split. If she is eligible I'd give here a 30% chance of winning (a slight plurality) so assuming my 60/40 split is somewhere in the ballpark of reasonable that leaves her 12%.\nWhere do her votes go if she's deemed ineligible? My guess from an hour or so of reading is primarily to Roxas. Both are allies of Aquino; Poe ran as an independent but as part of his Team PNoy in the 2013 senatorial elections and Roxas aggressively courted her to be his running mate as VP in this election. That likely migration is enough to boost Roxas' totals for me.\nBinay arguably has the value of incumbency in that he's the current Vice President (though he narrowly beat Roxas, who was affiliated with Aquino and has been endorsed by him), and his polling numbers seem to have stabilized after a steep fall from mid-2014 to mid-2015. Two of the last six vice presidents have gone on to the presidency, though the numbers increase to 2-of-3 if we disregard those who chose not to run. \nDuterte can't entirely be ruled out, but he's been vocally opposed to Poe's eligibility and its hard to imagine her support swinging his way if she's deemed ineligible.

The draft is also said to have been \"silent on the issue of eligibility of Poe as a natural-born citizen for being a foundling.\" Some of the justices are expected to disagree with the drafted opinion \"on the belief that the senator is eligible for the presidency and would meet the required residency\" by May 9.   The justices have not deliberated on the draft ruling yet but rumors abound that they have already voted 9-6 or 8-7 IN FAVOR OF POE.  The tone used by Poe herself regarding the issue may be telling. She said that she had heard different versions of the court's ruling but that \"nothing was final.\" The COMELEC disqualification of POE was based on the notion she was not a \"natural-born citizen as a foundling and had not met the 10-year residency requirement.\"  They cited that her \"intention to stay in the country for good was absent since she decided to keep her US citizenship and continued to use her US passport until 2010\" after returning to the Philippines in 2005.  Apparently Poe reacquired her residency in the country on Aug. 31, 2006, which, COMELEC says would meant that her residency eligibility would still fall short by about three months.

Her personal story is also huge, she was abandoned in a church at birth and later adopted by her famous parents. She's been challenged and even sued regarding residency qualifications.

She has a degree from Boston College and lived much of her adult life in Fairfax, Virginia. DUTERTE 26.4% -\nLawyer, has been mayor of a major city for 7 terms, Davao, which has consistently ranked among the top 10 safest cities in the world (4th in 2015).  He has been criticized by human rights groups for supporting extra judicial killings of alleged criminals by vigilante groups.  BINAY 21.4% - \nFormer human rights lawyer, helped fight Marcos as an activist 30 years ago. He became the mayor of the country's version of Wall St. and served as VP in 2010. He's popular but is tainted with accusations of corruption which is affecting him in the polls.  ROXAS 19.0% - \nEndorsed by Aquino, the current president. Held influential posts in government, has access to power as the ruling party's candidate. He was an investment banker, and has been credited with making the Philippines one of the world's top job outsourcing destinations.

Unfortunately it is too close to call based solely on the polls.  But I am assigning a small advantage to JB because he is the incumbent vice-president (and as such has more air-time on the media and better access to government means), This advantage is very slim, though: no more than 4%.  This is one of those forecasts that I expect  to be revised a LOT so it is important to state the conditions on which they can be altered: - since i am basing my forecast on poll aggregation I think  that new polls getting made are a factor. - some special event (hurricane, floods, earthquake) that would influence clearly the election on behalf of the incumbent VP (JB) as they provide more media opportunities for government officials (which can be critical on a very tight race like this)."], [19170, "2016-02-17T15:05:13Z", [0.45, 0.0, 0.2, 0.25, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [241, "2016-02-17T13:45:02Z", [0.25, 0.0, 0.37, 0.33, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [241, "2016-02-17T13:34:40Z", [0.25, 0.0, 0.4, 0.3, 0.05, 0.0], "I know absolutely nothing about Philippine politics so anything I say could be wrong.

That should give him some advantages, right?\n-Binay, the opposition coalition leader, evidently has an effective ground game. But, being tainted with corruption when an anti-corruption candidate is doing so well makes me bearish about his chances.\n-Poe has polled consistently well and seems to be an appealing candidate with successes in electoral and legislative politics.
