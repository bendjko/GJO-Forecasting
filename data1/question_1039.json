Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), one of the five senators who held up consideration of the legislation in the Senate last Congress, told The Hill last week that while he didn\u2019t oppose the bill last year, \u201cI insisted on certain provisions that would protect safety.\u201d When asked if he was working with Thune to address those provisions, Blumenthal said, \u201cnot yet, we may well, he knows about my concerns, so does Sen. Peters, and they haven\u2019t changed.\u201d\n-------------------------------------------------------------- [1] http://www.ushistory.org/gov/6e.asp\n[2] https://thehill.com/policy/transportation/444097-senate-commerce-chair-to-renew-push-for-regs-on-self-driving-vehicles"], [172, "2019-05-19T15:16:35Z", [0.15], ""], [1333, "2019-05-18T23:11:57Z", [0.29], ""], [73598, "2019-05-18T17:05:33Z", [0.9], ""], [62808, "2019-05-18T00:11:32Z", [1.0], ""], [61055, "2019-05-17T21:34:44Z", [0.05], ""], [691, "2019-05-17T20:20:51Z", [0.26], ""], [172, "2019-05-17T01:16:50Z", [0.15], ""], [73287, "2019-05-16T23:28:23Z", [0.0], "No he's a retard "], [6978, "2019-05-16T22:55:55Z", [0.0], "Omega hedging."], [14107, "2019-05-16T20:21:42Z", [0.15], "Increasing my forecast a bit since there is concrete movement: https://thehill.com/policy/transportation/444097-senate-commerce-chair-to-renew-push-for-regs-on-self-driving-vehicles"], [62808, "2019-05-15T22:15:09Z", [0.97], ""], [73202, "2019-05-14T16:22:33Z", [0.0], ""], [73152, "2019-05-11T05:40:12Z", [0.3], ""], [73109, "2019-05-09T10:15:55Z", [0.97], ""], [56, "2019-05-08T20:38:02Z", [0.45], "Starting to think Congress is going to have its hands full with other business."], [1333, "2019-05-08T09:36:54Z", [0.3], ""], [52575, "2019-05-08T08:15:13Z", [0.65], ""], [15196, "2019-05-07T02:37:13Z", [0.05], ""], [691, "2019-05-06T13:35:24Z", [0.26], ""], [691, "2019-05-03T19:48:53Z", [0.27], ""], [45821, "2019-05-02T09:34:17Z", [0.6], ""], [37379, "2019-04-30T02:57:23Z", [0.13], ""], [172, "2019-04-30T02:08:53Z", [0.25], ""], [14107, "2019-04-29T20:44:16Z", [0.13], ""], [1333, "2019-04-28T18:17:45Z", [0.31], ""], [72713, "2019-04-28T12:16:25Z", [0.1], "Trump is reportedly terrified of driverless cars, so this is unlikely unless there is some kind of jobs bill attached to it. https://futurism.com/donald-trump-trust-autonomous-cars"], [49838, "2019-04-27T20:00:30Z", [0.23], ""], [745, "2019-04-27T14:44:08Z", [0.55], ""], [13377, "2019-04-27T09:56:27Z", [0.28], ""], [593, "2019-04-27T08:11:40Z", [0.5], ""], [55675, "2019-04-27T03:36:21Z", [0.4], ""], [62808, "2019-04-26T20:36:36Z", [0.69], ""], [34376, "2019-04-24T07:52:05Z", [0.25], ""], [34836, "2019-04-22T21:11:11Z", [0.85], ""], [72558, "2019-04-22T11:23:35Z", [0.0], ""], [29464, "2019-04-22T05:59:04Z", [0.25], ""], [172, "2019-04-21T14:14:22Z", [0.25], ""], [41707, "2019-04-21T06:23:58Z", [0.2], ""], [63837, "2019-04-21T01:57:45Z", [0.75], "Lobbyists will make this happen"], [72492, "2019-04-20T21:06:18Z", [0.35], ""], [691, "2019-04-20T14:41:40Z", [0.28], ""], [71589, "2019-04-19T23:33:43Z", [0.45], ""], [14107, "2019-04-19T18:43:09Z", [0.15], "- Base rate for a bill getting passed seems about 4%.

In the coming month, the CR expires Dec 7, so Congress will have to pass a budget or kick the can with another CR. Based on the last 20 years, they will likely pass another short-term CR until about Jan 18 (MLK Day is Jan 21, so it buys Congress an extra 3 days with minimal impact in case they can't pass a budget or CR). Looking back and doing the calculations my self, the average CR length is 110 days (excluding 3 years with full-year CRs - including that data increases the CR length to 140 days). Conveniently, 110 days this year falls on Friday, Jan 18. So there's that. Putting the budget debacle aside, once Dems come into power in the House, they are likely to begin using their subpoena power rather quickly. They'll probably not go directly after Trump right out the gate, but will likely strike close enough to cause the President to react, which will then probably cause an escalation by both sides. The partisan rancor caused by this will likely kill off all but the most benign of bipartisan bills as each side will likely view with suspicion anything that helps the other. Congress will have roughly 7 months (the end of July) to get this legislation passed before going back into the budget debacle post-August recess. If it's not signed by July, the likelihood that it gets approved decreases as the pressure mounts on Congress and the WH to keep the government operational again.
