I assign probabilities to each house race using figures from 538's deluxe model. Then I run trials in which each race has that chance of a democrat winning. However, this treats the outcome of each race as an independent event, when in reality they are all affected by common factors. E. g., a change in the generic ballot will cause the probability of democratic victory to shift across the board for all races. So I need to find a way to make the outcomes correlate with each other, so that a democratic win in one district means a higher chance of a democratic win in all other districts, and vice versa.  I take the probabilities and modify them by a single random number, so that democratic victories are either made more or less probable across the board. Even this is not enough, since changes in the generic ballot will affect \"toss-up\" races more than safe seats. To solve this, I convert the random number into a likelihood ratio between 1:2.5 and 2.5:1, and feed it into Bayes Theorem (the priors are given by 538's forecasts). Races with probabilities closest to 50% are modified the most, while those closer to 0% or 100% are modified the least. So by simulating each race and altering the chances of democratic victory using a random likelihood ratio and Bayes Theorem, I (hopefully) capture the randomness involved in each race as well as the correlation between the results of all the races.
