Also, the blanket that Daryl was wearing is seen on the ground at the end of the trailer.   Carol is also seen alive far away from Neegan in another trailer. Daryl is an extremely popular character, his fans even have the slogan of \"If Daryl dies we riot\".  AMC may wish to soften the blow by releasing this spoiler.  In addition, pretty much the entire main cast will be on the Talking Dead post show which will be running over its hour at ninety minutes.  This is supposition, but it may be to say farewell to a long-lasting character or maybe just camouflage as to who the victim of the cliffhanger is. Norman Reedus, the actor who plays Daryl Dixon, is also branching out.  He has his own serial on AMC now, Ride with Norman Reedus, and has been in a number of films in 2015 and 2016.  While this is normal, the quantity exceeds his other cast mates.  Andrew Lincoln (Rick) and Chandler Riggs (Carl) show no other credits than the Walking Dead.  Steven Yeun (Glenn) has also just bought a house in Hollywood worth $2.3 million.  https://www.yahoo.com/news/walking-dead-star-steven-yeun-213342789.html  Acting can be sporadic, so even though Glenn is the one killed by Neegan in the comic source, Glenn will most probably live to fight another day. As mentioned above Norman Reedus is branching out and he is extremely popular with the fans.  However, some fans can be a bit nuts, with one biting him a paid photo-op  http://www.thewalkingdead.com/norman-reedus-bitten-by-fan/  Mr. Reedus was good-natured in not pressing charges, but released an understated picture of him wearing a \"Do Not Bite Me\" t-shirt.

Unlike a real human death (a physical event where an approximation of the time of death can usually be made), the death of a fictional character is different.   At the close of Season 6 we infer that someone may have died: but we do not know with 100% certainty.  We see a bloodied bat, but do not know where the blood came from.  There is absolutly no indication that any specific character has been protrayed as \"dead\" to the viewer. This puts the writers in a priviledged position: they have a lot of time to determine who, if any of the characters should be portrayed in Season 7, as having died in Season 6.

Any indication that the writers final decision on the fatal outcome was determined after the close of Season 6, would prove the fictional character was killed off by the writers after Season 6, regardless of what the viewer sees in Season 7.

This is a great analysis of the reasoning I prefer\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQi-HyIIF18\nIt provides two other arguments as well, both of which are pretty interesting, but the POV reasoning is what really convinces me. I reckon probability is really about 50% on Michonne, with remaining 50% on Glenn.

Based on Abraham's behavior/demeanor during the encounter -- somewhat defiant, fixing his posture, and raising his head when addressed by Negan -- I think Abraham is most likely to swallow the hit, and raise his head again after the 1st strike.  I'm not putting much traction on Glenn's death, and will probably lower his odds with the passage of time. After his fake-out death midway through this season, I couldn't imagine the writers choosing to kill him off. It would just be poor writing, and make that whole dumpster sequence pointless.  On a side note, Steven Yeun is one of very few breakthrough Asian actors, catering to a huge demographic of TWD's viewership.

Although I don't personally watch the show, I talked to a friend who is an avid fan to get an overview of the situation. First of all, the season ended with someone presumably being getting killed, but it's unclear who exactly died. However, neither Carol, Carl, or Rick were in the scene beforehand, so it's almost impossible that it was one of those three characters. This would seem to leave Glenn and Daryl, who were both in the scene. My friend stated that, in the show, most deaths have followed the comics (where the timeline is further ahead than the show). The exception to this rule is when specific actors have wanted to leave the show and/or have secured contracts elsewhere, since it's almost impossible for an actor to be on two tv shows at once. Unless there is significant reason to believe Daryl is leaving, there is a high chance that Glenn was killed in that scene. Reasons Glenn would be killed: 1. Glenn is killed in this scene in the comics (with a baseball bat), and the show tends to follow the comics.\n2. The show writers have been teasing Glenn's death for the past 2 seasons, both in one scene where he was threatened with a baseball bat and another where he appeared to have been overrun by zombies.\n3. Audio analysis of the final moments of the show appear to show Glenn calling out Maggie (his wife's name) just before he is killed.\n4.The actor who plays Glenn (Steven Yuen) has an upcoming show listed on IMDB. He will be voicing a main character in an animated show (called Voltron: Legendary Defender). While this is not a definitive signal he is leaving (voiceover work is less time consuming, and it's possible for actors to do voiceover work on the side), this is still an indication that he is more likely to be leaving the show. Reasons Daryl might be killed: 1. He has other options and wants to leave the show.\n-A good indicator of this is looking at upcoming shows on IMDB. Norman Reeds, the actor who plays Daryl, does in fact have an upcoming show. However, this show is during the summer (meaning it won't overlap with filming of the next season of The Walking Dead) and it's produced by AMC, the station that airs The Walking Dead. Both of these factors indicate that Norman Reedus intends to stay with AMC and The Walking Dead (TWD), otherwise he wouldn't have worked to fit a new show around the production schedule of TWD. Based on the high probability of Glenn dying and the relatively low chance of Daryl being killed, I put my probabilities a: 75% Glenn\n25% Daryl The other potential options are: 1. No one was actually killed, the character was just knocked unconscious, etc. Probability: The new character introduced is clearly intended to be a murderous, psychopathic villain. This murder is an important plot point in establishing his character- any result that didn't lead to a death would not have the same effect. Additionally, this character murders someone in the comics (Glenn in particular), and to not have him murder anyone would also be a serious deviation from the original character. Finally, leaving what is clearly intended to be a death as a cliffhanger then choosing something other than death would be a huge twist for the fan base, and would likely result in negative feedback and ratings without a very good explanation. I put my probability of this at 1%. 2. Another character was killed (not Daryl, Glen, Rick, Carol, or Carl). While there is a chance of this happening, it's very small. Bringing in a character who was clearly not in the scene could be seen as a deus ex machina revelation, leading to negative feedback from the fan base. Additionally, this death is important to establish the villain, and killing a character like Glenn or Daryl will have the most impact. I put my probability of this at 1%. Probability: Chance of no one dying + chance of another character dying: 1%+1%=2% chance all of the above will survive. I subtract this equally from Glenn and Daryl\u2019s probabilities to get: Glenn: 74%\nDaryl: 24%\nNone of these: 2% Sources:\nhttp://www.imdb.com/name/nm3081796/\nhttp://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005342/?ref_=nv_sr_1\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1520211/?ref_=nv_sr_1"], [519, "2016-04-05T15:07:21Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [519, "2016-04-05T15:06:29Z", [0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0], ""], [12302, "2016-04-05T14:05:23Z", [0.5, 0.15, 0.0, 0.0, 0.35, 0.0], "In case this question doesn't get closed.

You\u2019ve even become an important part of the group\u2014either Rick\u2019s, or Negan's.\n\nWhat are your chances of survival? Would they be any higher if you were someone else? A little taller? A little older? A little better lookin\u2019? We all know the \u201cred shirts\u201d are going to die. This is why, when we are sitting on the porch swing in Alexandria, and we see someone we don\u2019t recognize go out the gates with Rick or Daryl or Michonne, we know that by the end of the day he\u2019ll make it to dinner, just not his own.  Ultimately this question hinges on whether any of the main characters fit into high risk groups. The highest risk are those who\u2019ve been in only a few episodes. But there are risks for those who\u2019ve been around for a while.  If you\u2019ve become part of the group in later years, you have less chance of being killed in any given season. Seasons 1 and 2 saw on average 23 percent of the main characters losing their lives. The battle with the Governor took the largest proportion (41%). The average in later years was 18%, but the flu took the lives of dozens of red shirts. Anyone who sets himself against Rick has a 100% chance of getting a bullet through the brain\u2014of course, it may not be Rick\u2019s bullet. Being male or female may make some difference, but in truth it makes more difference about whether or not you\u2019ll get past the red shirt stage. Women account for 38% of the main group (men 62%), and only half of them die. If you\u2019re an annoying whiner like Lori, however, it\u2019s probably best to write your last will and testament right now. Men die at a slightly higher rate than women (78%). The real deciding vote is age. If you are in your sixties or seventies, you are among a small group, but as sure as the sky is blue, you\u2019ll find yourself food for worms (or zombies) within two seasons. So if you come to the end of the second season, you\u2019d better start looking carefully around corners. You\u2019re fairly safe as a child. Teenage girls are doomed, while teenage boys fair quite a bit better. The thirties are a dangerous age, specifically if you are a man. A man in his thirties, has a 100% chance of death. In your 40s, it\u2019s pretty much a coin-toss. So what does this say about the finale? Will any of our favorites die? With Carol running off, Morgan chasing after her, Glen, Michonne, Daryl and Rosita getting captured by Negan, What chance do they have? All people who die do so in their first three seasons (mostly in their second season). However, just because something hasn\u2019t happened, doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t (black swan problem). If we take total chance of death as a Bayesian prior and individual risk as the conditional we get the above predictions. If the trend holds, however, we do expect 1 or two more significant deaths. Given Eugene\u2019s age, gender, and number of seasons on the show, he has an extremely high chance of being one of the deaths-- especially since some looks have started being thrown between him and Rosita, he\u2019s changed up the \u2018do and earned the respect of Abraham. Rosita and Sasha have a 10% risk in the finale."], [13361, "2016-04-03T17:55:14Z", [0.4, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.05], "*Explanation contains comic spoilers*   With all the hype, someone will die tonight.

On the other hand, Abraham missed his own comics death scene when Denise took the arrow to the head. Abraham has also gone through an awakening of sorts - broken up with Rosita to move on to Sasha + his breakup/makeup with Eugene - so he's likely completed the \"character development arc before death\" sequence.  Less possible - Daryl is shot, but for whatever reason he's supposedly \"fine\" according to last week's ending. And the internet will revolt if Daryl dies, so odds are, he survives.  The two current moral compasses are off somewhere - Carol  with Morgan trailing  - so I suppose one of them could die - but it seems unlikely the show would have Negan use his bat Lucille on a previously battered woman (Carol)... or a pregnant one (Maggie).

However, because it's Glenn and, because this would be the first time the show has ever faked a  \u201cdeath\u201d of a main character, let's look at the details of what has been called by some fans \"the dream-sequence\" with an optimistic skepticism (that is if we believe Glenn's living to be an \"optimistic outcome\".)  (1) Time always seems to slow down and reality becomes aberrant every time Nicholas goes into re-boot mode. When Nicholas shoots himself in the head, this is the slo-mo reality we are treated to.  Note however that Glenn and he are face-to-face and Nicholas shoots himself in the right side of his head.  When the camera catches the action directed at Glenn, Glenn is being splattered with blood (from somewhere) on the right side of his head and not his face straight on nor the left side. What? How is this possible if they were face-to-face?  I do not see how this is possible.  At first I thought something else happen.  Some one on Glenn's right side shot someone and blood splattered on his right side. Or Glenn himself was shot on the right side of his head.  None of this goes along with the following part of the scene on the ground. (2) Once on the ground, Nicholas falls  beside or on top of Glenn.  We see a Glenn very much alive and screaming as some form of heart and ruptured aorta start pumping massive amounts of blood everywhere.  Then at about Glenn's upper chest level, we see small intestines being consumed with Glenn also looking at this happen.  I do not believe Glenn - if all this was happening to his own body - could still be conscious and screaming.  This might have been going on with Nicholas' body. This could have been a complete dream sequence of sorts.  However, unless the heavens open up and the righteous hand of god reaches down and plucks Glenn out of that mass of walking dead inhumanity, I see no escape for him and Nicholas. This has added back some doubt, I re-arrange percentages a little to reflect that. After all Rick was either bitten or cut himself up pretty bad in the hand. He is now surrounded in the RV by Walkers.

Last season was largely a bust when it came to main characters dying, which is why I think it is more likely than not that we will see a main character die.  That is why I have initially forecasted at 10% that 'all will survive season 6.' Rick is the central character in the show, and at this point there has not been an effort to transition his role to another character; therefore, it is very unlikely he will die from what we know at this point.  I am setting aside my rule-of-thumb and forecasting the likelihood of Rick's demise at 5%. Daryl has emerged as a key figure in the show, acting as a foil to Rick, especially last season.  From the preseason speculation it appears Daryl will have a challenging season.  That written, I think it is unlikely he will die, because a major narrative device for the show is pulling the group apart and then bringing them back together.  I forecast the likelihood of his death at 10%...for now. From the comics, we know Carol, Glenn and Carl all die.  We also know the producers have purposely walked away from the comic storyline.  Rick did go off the rails last season, and given that the Carl character can bring Rick into the fold in ways that Glenn and Carol can't, I think it's more likely that Carl will survive than Carol or Glenn from what we know at present. That brings me to Glenn and Carol, who in my estimation have the greatest chance of dying in Season 6.  Carol turned very dark over the last few seasons, her surrogate daughters are dead, and it appears that the undercurrent between Carol and Daryl has dried up.  These developments suggest to me that Carol is more expendable as compared to Glenn.  By contrast, Glenn's character remains tied to Maggie.  Until the writers shift their focus to Glenn and Maggie, I think Glenn is somewhat safer than Carol.
