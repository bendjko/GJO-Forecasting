Putting more weight to monetary policy voting behavior of 2008-2018, the probabilities are set accordingly: 87% maintain,6% increase and 7% reduce.  Since recording in 1997, the committee only voted for an increase of +0,25%. In case there would be an increase, we can exclude an increase of more than 1%.

When looking at the voting behavior after the financial crisis, there was only a reduce of -0,25%. In case there would be a reduce, we can exclude less than 0,26% The Bank of England states that to meet their inflation target of 2%, they need to judge how much people intend to save and spend given the current interest rates.  So, this raises the following question: Will people start spending less than save given the current interest rates when Britain will leave the EU on 29 March 2019?  According to this article of the Financial Times, households are spending & borrowing more than saving. The article states that one danger for the economy is that households will save more again after the 29th of March, which could hurt the wider economy. Now, will the Bank Of England react before the 1st of April with a decrease of the Bank rate? There\u2019s great uncertainty on how the Brexit will be implemented and how it will impact businesses and households. For now, I would see the voting committee to rather wait and follow spending/saving behaviour up to the March 29. \nsource FT = https://www.ft.com/content/cf51e840-7147-11e7-93ff-99f383b09ff9 "], [82, "2019-01-07T18:50:15Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.75, 0.23, 0.01], ""], [61877, "2019-01-07T16:38:47Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.75, 0.0], ""], [66060, "2019-01-07T04:30:31Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [172, "2019-01-07T01:26:53Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.75, 0.15, 0.05], ""], [65401, "2019-01-07T00:42:13Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.5, 0.3, 0.1], ""], [65481, "2019-01-06T21:34:38Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.7, 0.0], ""], [65774, "2019-01-06T21:26:22Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.25], "I have a feeling"], [65676, "2019-01-06T21:04:48Z", [0.1, 0.45, 0.3, 0.12, 0.03], ""], [65388, "2019-01-06T20:46:52Z", [0.0, 0.2, 0.6, 0.2, 0.0], ""], [65363, "2019-01-06T20:00:00Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.8, 0.1, 0.0], "Can't change things at this time"], [64571, "2019-01-06T18:49:49Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [64871, "2019-01-06T17:56:55Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [64330, "2019-01-06T17:14:20Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.63, 0.31, 0.01], ""], [64407, "2019-01-06T17:10:28Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.8, 0.05, 0.0], "Why would there be any added instability with an increase?"], [64695, "2019-01-06T17:04:10Z", [0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1], "Recession more likely than inflation."], [64714, "2019-01-06T16:49:51Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.8, 0.05, 0.05], ""], [64581, "2019-01-06T16:48:16Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.15, 0.55, 0.15], ""], [64636, "2019-01-06T16:42:06Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99, 0.0], "Changes make people nervous."], [49484, "2019-01-06T16:26:57Z", [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.2, 0.05], ""], [64260, "2019-01-06T16:11:04Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [63914, "2019-01-06T11:06:08Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.3, 0.7, 0.0], "More than 1% is a disaster scenario which would be brought on  by severe oscillation in the value of the pound, and I think they will tie everything down with lead chains to prevent that, certainly as of April.

Even so, interest rates are expected to climb in 2019, with 28 of 47 respondents forecasting an increase from the present 0.75 per cent; 12 of them expect two quarter-point increases to 1.25 per cent. There was a spread of responses from Brexiteers, who modelled variations of a managed no deal. Mr Minford expects to see a big increase in rates to 1.5 per cent as wage growth of more than 4 per cent offsets the deflationary effect of a sterling appreciation to $1.35. Mr Lilico, who anticipates an economic slowdown next year, sees rates cut to 0.25 per cent as wage growth slows to 1.5 per cent. Mr Lyons expects sterling, wages and rates to hold steady and Ms Lea expects only a single quarter-point increase. On balance, households should expect an increase in borrowing costs. Unless, according to Remainer economists, there is a hard Brexit, when rates are more likely to be cut, at least temporarily.

Also putting in a bit of a hedge in case this works out and there is less uncertainty by putting 10% on an increase. Current economic consensus forecasts seem to think the economy should be about same.[2] Will likely cut off the 2% off the ends after the vote. \u201cWe still expect the Bank of England to hike around once a year and our base case is that the next hike will arrive in May 2019, so after the UK formally leaves the EU. It may be earlier (February) if the economy continues to surprise on the upside. On the other hand, the Bank of England also stated that Brexit uncertainty has gone up among businesses, as nearly 20% of companies now think Brexit is the key source of uncertainty. This probably explains why there is no growth in business investments.\u201d \u201cThe rate decision also depends on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations. One box in the Inflation Report explains the Bank of England\u2019s reaction in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The overall takeaway is that while the Bank of England cannot offset lower potential growth due to changes in the supply side of the economy, it can react to demand changes. Our view is that a \u2018no-deal Brexit\u2019 would most likely hit the economy through lower demand due to lower business confidence, which would most likely force the Bank of England to ease monetary policy by cutting the Bank Rate.\u201d[3] [1] https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/30/brexit-eu-dismisses-mays-claim-that-deal-might-be-renegotiated [2] https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/757823/Forecomp_November_2018_PDF.pdf [3] https://www.fxstreet.com/news/bank-of-england-rate-hike-expected-by-may-2019-but-depends-on-brexit-danske-bank-201811011911"], [63224, "2018-11-30T17:58:53Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "Too much flux in international markets, the MPC will ask a pretty penny."], [63221, "2018-11-30T17:29:05Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.95, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [62846, "2018-11-30T16:29:33Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.6, 0.4, 0.0], ""], [63213, "2018-11-30T16:03:26Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.99, 0.01], ""], [63207, "2018-11-30T14:46:10Z", [0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.2, 0.0], ""], [63203, "2018-11-30T14:22:08Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.3, 0.7, 0.0], ""], [2450, "2018-11-30T11:47:10Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.2], ""], [63193, "2018-11-30T11:12:31Z", [0.05, 0.15, 0.25, 0.5, 0.05], ""], [63187, "2018-11-30T08:41:57Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "With all the uncertainty around Brexit the government will likely want to keep monetary policy tight in the months after."], [63173, "2018-11-30T05:09:20Z", [0.2, 0.5, 0.15, 0.1, 0.05], ""], [63165, "2018-11-30T03:21:20Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.1, 0.8], ""], [23006, "2018-11-29T22:11:29Z", [0.0, 0.26, 0.6, 0.14, 0.0], ""], [601, "2018-11-29T20:14:39Z", [0.0, 0.21, 0.65, 0.14, 0.0], ""], [63135, "2018-11-29T19:16:11Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.63, 0.35, 0.01], ""], [63138, "2018-11-29T18:29:03Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.75, 0.2, 0.0], ""], [62438, "2018-11-29T16:34:56Z", [0.0, 0.03, 0.67, 0.3, 0.0], ""], [62438, "2018-11-29T16:27:37Z", [0.0, 0.02, 0.67, 0.3, 0.01], ""], [62953, "2018-11-29T14:12:28Z", [0.05, 0.1, 0.65, 0.15, 0.05], ""], [12704, "2018-11-29T10:45:40Z", [0.0, 0.2, 0.75, 0.05, 0.0], "A move of more than 50bps down is unlikely.

I would be more confident of rate going up if the outcome of Brexit negotiations were clearer - but as Mark Carney (Governor of the Bank of England) has said, rates may go up or down in support of the Brexit outcomes - http://uk.businessinsider.com/bank-of-england-interest-rate-decision-and-inflation-report-2018-11.
