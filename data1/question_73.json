China has already built military length airstrips on these islands.\n\"It now seems that these structures are an evolution of point-defense fortifications already constructed at China\u2019s smaller facilities on Gaven, Hughes, Johnson, and Cuarteron reefs,\" it said citing images taken in November and made available to Reuters.\n\"This model has gone through another evolution at (the) much-larger bases on Fiery Cross, Subi and Mischief reefs.\"\nSatellite images of Hughes and Gaven reefs showed what appeared to be anti-aircraft guns and what were likely to be close-in weapons systems (CIWS) to protect against cruise missile strikes, it said.\nImages from Fiery Cross Reef showed towers that likely contained targeting radar, it said.\nAMTI said covers had been installed on the towers at Fiery Cross, but the size of platforms on these and the covers suggested they concealed defense systems similar to those at the smaller reefs (para. 1-8).

Beijing has refused to recognize the ruling but ties between China and several claimant states have warmed since The Hague decision.\nAfter Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s first trip to China late last month, Manila said China relaxed restrictions on fishing in the contested Scarborough Shoal, which China calls Huangyan Island (para 1-6).

A Pentagon statement posted on the news site of the U.S. Naval Institute described the Chinese pilot's actions this way: \"One of the intercepting Chinese jets had an unsafe excessive rate of closure on the [American] aircraft. Initial assessment is that this seems to be a case of improper airmanship, as no other provocative or unsafe maneuvers occurred. The Department of Defense is addressing the issue with China in appropriate diplomatic and military channels.\" \"In May, The New York Times reported another incident in which a Chinese jet flew dangerously close to an American military aircraft. \"Last year, the U.S. and China signed an updated agreement meant to ensure safe \"air to air\" interactions between American and Chinese military aircraft. That agreement includes a provision saying pilots should avoid \"approaching the other side's military aircraft at an uncontrolled closure rate that may endanger the safety of either aircraft.\"\n~~~~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  This article was about the recent death of a top Chinese pilot during a training exercise.

The National People's Congress (NPC) in Beijing ruled that lawmakers must swear allegiance to Hong Kong as part of China and that candidates would be disqualified if they changed the wording of their oath of office or if they failed to take it in a sincere and solemn manner. The prospect of the ruling had sparked protests in the former British colony on Sunday. Foreign diplomats were watching closely, stressing the importance of the rule of the law to the city's international reputation. While the controversial decision effectively bars the two pro-independence Hong Kong politicians from being sworn in, a court in the Chinese-ruled city must still rule on the case, taking Beijing's decision into consideration. The promotion of independence has long been taboo in Hong Kong, governed under a \"one country, two systems\" principle since 1997, amid fears in Beijing it could spread among other activists and challenge the central government's rule (para. 1-5).

In the Yellow Sea, however, there is no evidence that China is encouraging fishing boats to sail into Korean coastal waters, or that the fishermen are part of a wider strategic land grab, experts said (para. 8-10).

I don't know how many are in the crew of such a South Korean boat, but the Yahoo news account carries a picture of a speedboat with a crew of seven, by my count. (It may be a stock photo, though.) https://www.yahoo.com/news/beijing-tells-seoul-stay-calm-205236784.html A report from Maritime Executive claims that an officer from the Korean boat was \"forced into the water,\" but subsequently rescued.  FP says the Korean speedboat was sunk; Yahoo doesn't. The South Korea English-language news organization Arirang News posted a video of a news segment describing the attack, which includes footage of Korean officers boarding a boat (presumably Chinese). https://youtu.be/ItRDHxoPsbc That could be stock footage as well. Arirang says that one Korean officer dove into the sea to avoid being injured. It reports that the Korean speedboat was sunk. The report goes on to say that Korea is going to bring a charge of attempted murder. The Arirang report also notes that after a drop in the number of Chinese boats in the area, they increased significantly in September for the blue crab season. (Graph.)

Stratfor has been reliable in past South China Sea Sit-Reps based on later verification by indepedent sources. On this occasion the analysis seems spot on: no comprehensive solution but one step towards resolving the specific issue of Scarborough Shoal.\nI surmise that diplomatic efforts are continuing.   \n\"After months of diplomatic haggling between China and the Philippines, the two may be moving toward an understanding on their competing claims in the South China Sea. On Aug. 29, China's ambassador to the Philippines, Zhao Jinhua, announced that Beijing was willing to hold bilateral talks with Manila and would \"look into the possibility\" of allowing Filipino fishermen to fish in the disputed waters, particularly around the Scarborough Shoal. The ambassador's comments come in the wake of a series of meetings between Chinese and Philippine officials, as well as several instances of accommodating rhetoric from both sides. They also come nearly seven weeks after a landmark ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration that invalidated China's sweeping claims over the South China Sea. Yet despite the ostensible victory for his country, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte appears willing to temporarily set aside the court's decision to mend ties with China. To that end, Duterte has repeatedly called for talks between Manila and Beijing, and he has vowed not to raise the court's ruling at an Association of Southeast Asian Nations meeting in September. So far China has responded well to his outreach, particularly as it struggles to manage the fallout of the ruling elsewhere and rising tension with Japan in the East China Sea. Of course, this by no means indicates that detente will come at the expense of the Philippines' maritime sovereignty. Duterte has proved himself to be a savvy politician, and he is undoubtedly trying to use the upper hand Manila has gained to pursue better economic deals with China while continuing to cooperate with other powers, such as Japan and the United States. One of the key concessions the Philippines has discussed with China is a proposal for joint fishing around the Scarborough Shoal. Since China seized it in 2012, the shoal has lain at the center of the maritime dispute between Manila and Beijing, both because of its proximity to the Philippine mainland (about 120 nautical miles) and because of the repeated clashes between Chinese and Philippine fishermen in the waters around it. (China has attempted to block foreign fishermen from tapping into the shoal's waters, which are rich with fish.) When the international court ruled against Beijing's claim to the shoal, fears arose that China would retaliate somehow, prompting the United States to warn against further \"provocative action\" on Beijing's part.  Since China hopes to avoid inciting a U.S. military response, its strategy around the Scarborough Shoal has effectively run its course. For now, at least, this has created room for cooperation with the Philippines, as has Manila's own efforts to regulate the activities of its fishermen in the area. Of course, any deal between the two countries would depend on their continuing political will to abide by it and on how broader disputes over China's claims in the South China Sea play out. Though a deal on joint fishing may not necessarily lead to broader cooperation in the South China Sea, it would prevent one of the most heated aspects of the dispute from escalating.

That\u2019s faster than the increase in the U.S. and U.K. in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis. The problem could be bigger still because the frantic pace of new lending makes it hard to know how many loans aren't being repaid. Regulatory loopholes, banks' off-balance-sheet portfolios of wealth management products (likened by some to Western lenders' exposures in the subprime crisis), and widespread shadow banking practices further complicate the picture \u2014 as does a system of implicit guarantees that obscures how much of the debt is backed by the government or who would be allowed to go bust. Local and provincial governments have borrowed about $4 trillion\u2014the size of Germany's economy\u2014and some used shorter-term, off-balance-sheet borrowing to fund dubious infrastructure and real estate projects. Chinese authorities are gradually allowing more defaults, which is driving up financing costs for companies. Banks have begun exchanging high-interest loans to local governments for low-cost bonds in a state-backed swap program that may expand to 15 trillion yuan ($2.3 trillion). The debt splurge continues: Borrowing by 29 of China's 31 provinces skyrocketed 53 percent in just two years through the end of 2015. And $1 trillion of new credit was granted in the first three months of 2016, much of it flowing into a resurgent property market.

Foreign ministers from the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) met for the first time since the U.N.-backed Permanent Court of Arbitration handed an emphatic legal victory to the Philippines in the dispute this month (Newsweek, 2016). The ruling by the court in The Hague denied China's sweeping claims in the strategic seaway, through which more than $5 trillion in global trade passes each year (Newsweek, 2016). Thai Foreign Minister Don Pramudwinai told reporters after the emergency meeting that South China Sea was not discussed at all. He, however, said ASEAN will issue the joint statement after all, but refused to say if the communique will contain a reference to South China Sea and China (Joshi & Malloy, 2016). \n\"You will read it,\" he said cryptically. Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi also said: \"It's very positive ... We are very much on track\" to release the communique. She also would not say if the communique would refer to the South China Sea, or the decision of an international tribunal, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, earlier this month that said China's expansive claims in the region are illegal (Joshi & Malloy, 2016). The stalemate puts pressure on ASEAN's cherished unity and also gives an upper hand to China, which has used every diplomatic means at its disposal to stave off wider international criticism over moves it's made in the South China Sea that have impacted the four Southeast Asian countries (Joshi & Malloy, 2016).   NOTE\nThe UN officially came into existence on 24 October 1945, after ratification of the United Nations Charter by the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (the Republic of China, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and a majority of the other signatories.

It willl most likely declare the nine-dash line as inconsistent with international law, but it may decide on maritime rights in the South China Sea in a way that may open other avenues for more discussions. Here are three more possible rulings. 1. Everything above water at high-tide is an island entitled to a 200 nautical mile EEZ. This will lead to a massive overlap of maritime boundaries as most of the disputed land formations in the Spratlys are clumped close together. Overlapping boundaries will have to be resolved via compulsory conciliation, again with Unclos as guide, but with a different set of judges. With the reefs it controls in the Spratlys, China can lay claim to a large swathe of the South China Sea, though it may be smaller than the area covered by its nine-dash line, and engage claimants individually in resolving border overlaps. 2. The smallest features, including Scarborough shoal, are rocks that get a 12-mile boundary and territorial seas. The court will leave open for discussion whether the larger land features -- particularly those with vegetation - can be considered islands with a 200-nautical mile EEZ. That will still leave a very large area in dispute, and may yet give China's artificial islands an EEZ, but it will at least put everyone on the same page as to how claims should be made under Unclos. Again, it opens up a path to negotiations with China.. 3. Everything in the South China Sea are rocks, except Itu Aba. The tribunal may dismiss the Philippines' claim that Itu Aba is not an island because it does not have naturally occuring freshwater. (Taiwan has been mounting a media campaign to show that Itu Aba does indeed have its own water source.) Itu Aba's 200-nautical mile EEZ will be recognised, but its borders will have to be determined via compulsory conciliation, as these will overlap with a large chunk of the Philippines' south-western border. This is the ruling most pundits are betting on. This concedes to Taiwan's position, and reduces the dispute to waters around Itu Aba.\" http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/philippines-v-china-in-the-south-china-sea-all-you-need-to-know-ahead-of-the-hague-ruling\n"], [1034, "2016-07-10T09:07:40Z", [0.0], ""], [23006, "2016-07-10T01:34:38Z", [0.49], "live fire drills"], [556, "2016-07-10T00:50:52Z", [0.18], "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/chinese-navy-holds-live-fire-drills-in-south-china-sea/2016/07/09/ebed14dc-4634-11e6-a76d-3550dba926ac_story.html Enough saber-rattling.. and somebody gets a finger bloodied."], [180, "2016-07-09T18:30:57Z", [0.75], ""], [691, "2016-07-09T11:44:20Z", [0.08], "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-southchinasea-china-navy-idUSKCN0ZP036\nIt is possible to wonder whether the PRC is perhaps trying, or at least willing, to provoke an incident--not with the US, of course, but with one of the other players--in order to show that they're serious about all this.

The newspaper accused the US of \"taking advantage\" of the tension between China and its Asian neighbors\u2019 to \"deploy more military forces\" that pose a \"direct threat to China's national security\" (\u00b6 4). This article comes from a very nationalist Chinese news media one that serves to project propaganda both to the world and the populous of China [a collective society]. Noting Chinas\u2019 stance on the \u201caggressive actions of America in international open waters with the deployment of two aircraft carriers and its carrier support group. Normal operations for the US Naval directive to deploy into areas of the highest tension relative to American allies in such regions (Connor, 2016).\nChina in the past several years, indeed itself continues to operate in the most aggressive advance on other sovereign nations territories staking a self-proclaimed ownership of internationally agreed upon waters of these nations. Building artificial islands for the sole purpose of installation of military airfields and anti-aircraft battements in an attempt to move its original and internationally accepted contiguous and exclusive economic zones.\nBased on just a statement of \u201chistorical maps\u201d nevertheless when researched these official Chinese maps specifically the Qianlong\u2019s Map in Thirteen Rows, published in 1760 cast doubt on China\u2019s claims (Daiss, 2016). Author Panda, (2016) states that: \u201cThe United States\u2019 top diplomat issued a sharp warning to China. Speaking in Mongolia on Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry warning that the United States would treat a Chinese ADIZ over the South China Sea as a \u201cprovocative and destabilizing act\u201d (\u00b6 1). China\u2019s actions on the ADIZ seem to exists to deter the current United States push to continue on with surveillance flights and freedom of navigation patrols, all activities that Beijing understands to stand as \u201cmilitarization\u201d of the South China Sea (Panda, 2016). As The Hague verdict gets closer, Beijing has often spoken out, stating that the case goes beyond the sole jurisdiction of UNCLOS; thus China has insisted multiple times that it will not acknowledge ant court's decision. Furthermore, China has existed in a state of steady ramping up propaganda campaigns to declare their historical rights in the South China Seas\u2019 utilizing state news agency Xinhua, publishing daily articles outlining this undocumented view. It's also important to note the tribunal has no jurisdiction to decide any issues over the sovereignty of islands and rocks in the South China Sea -- the heart of the controversy. UNCLOS only deals with control of the waters surrounding them (Westcott, 2016). Should China openly/directly/intentionally attack the US or a US ally their actions would allow for the involvement of NATO into the now primary legal argument. One might also consider that fact that Russia now a seemingly odd bedfellow aligning with China, has in the past few years in the Ukraine not crossed that line, as well would not advise or aid China in doing so.

Have you noticed these remarks? Second, the Cambodian police plans to repatriate all the 27 telecom fraud suspects from the mainland and Taiwan based on the \"one China\" policy. Do you know the details? Is there any call from Taiwan to repatriate those Taiwan suspects? A: We have stated our position over the weekend on Indonesian navy vessels harassing and shooting Chinese fishing boats and fishermen. This took place in waters which are Chinese fishermen's traditional fishing grounds and where China and Indonesia have overlapping claims for maritime rights and interests. The Indonesian vessels that harassed and shot Chinese fishing boats with a willful resort to force put the life and property of Chinese fishermen in danger and violated international laws including UNCLOS and the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC). China strongly protests and condemns the abuse of force. China urges the Indonesian side to stop taking actions that complicate, exacerbate the dispute and undermine regional peace and stability, and handle the fishery issue at sea in a constructive way. China has no territorial sovereignty dispute with Indonesia. Yet the two countries have overlapping claims for maritime rights and interests over some part of the South China Sea. The two sides have normal communication channels, and it is hoped that they will step up communication in a friendly and constructive way and properly settle relevant issue. On your second question, we commend the Cambodian side for handling relevant issue based on the \"one China\" principle. You may ask competent authorities for the specifics of this case and the communication across the Straits. --END-- Well, are we seeing a push to finally resolve \"over-lapping claims?\" It seems to have been the long-standing approach of China to just ignore the issue, thus obtaining defacto what might otherwise be denied dejure. Is Indonesia really prepared to push the issue? The U.S. has two aircraft carriers supported by three guided missile cruisers and six destroyers in the region.

Assuming that the most likely scenario for another mid-air incident is between the US and China, then that suggests a probability on the order of 1/5600, assuming the US flies through the area every day. China has been stepping up it's aerial activities and aggression in the area recently, I seem to be able to recall recently news of 2 close calls of similar incidents between the US and China air power projection. Even a ten fold increase in the observed risk would only mean a roughly 0.2% chance of some similar incident to happen. The probability of a purposeful military operation that causes human casualties is likely significantly less than 1%, as it does not appear to be in anyone's strategic interests to do so. The interaction between coast guards, like the incident with the Indonesian coast guard's capture of a Chinese fishing vessel, seems to be the most likely mode for some interaction to lead to a fatality. A European Maritime Safety Agency report for 2013 shows that there were 75 fatalities with 2782 ships involved. Each incident may have involved more than one fatality (this includes the grounding of a ferry off the coast of Italy that claimed 25 lives) but also more than one ship may have been involved in a single incident. If those two adjustments cancel, then we get a guess of just under 3% probability of a fatal incident occurring from some sort of a ship to ship interaction. Given that fishing ships are constantly trolling the area (both legally and illegally), the opportunity for some sort of confrontation seems high (perhaps occurring on a daily basis), though the chance of a ramming like the one this March is likely significantly lower than that. If we guess there are somewhere between 2 and 3 incidents of a ship to ship contact from now till the end of the year, that gives a probability that one of these will end in a fatality between 5 and 8%. Call that 6.5%.

This interview is from four years ago but it shows the interest all parties have in the SCS to maintain stability and economic growth among the different countries. Even if China continues to make provocative moves in the SCS the US and other nations will do their best to avoid escalating tensions. Tensions may wax and wane as the situation continues but this is not the new cold war. Cooperation between the US and China is more evident than ever before. The US, China, Vietnam, Philippines, and other actors all have an interest in open dialogue and maintaining peace in the South East. No one, even China, has so much to gain from military confrontation that it would be valuable enough to offset the cost of harm done by reckless endangerment.   If we look at the recent history of powerful nations exerting territorial claims we will find that global response is often in rhetoric condemning the action and seeking the problem from getting any worse, but rarely do we see military response. Russia's invasion of Georgia, annexation of Crimea, and support of rebels in eastern Ukraine show how unwilling the United States is to escalate a situation by rapid military response. Israel's operations in Gaza and encroachment on the West Bank also show the same attitude.  When the United States sends an aircraft carrier group into the area it is not doing so simply in hopes to escalate tensions but because it believes doing so will help stabilize the region and solve problems on the ground.

Aggregate all of these, the probability of lethal confrontation in South China Sea = 62%*10%*99%+1%=7.1%\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_disputes_in_the_South_China_Sea East: the same logic, I counted only the 2010 encounter between China and Japan, so that\u2019s 13% probability of encounters. Nature of the dispute here is about EEZ, and it\u2019s between China and Japan, so the probability of event getting out of control feels lower, call it 3%. Aggregate with the 1% of unintentional event probability, for East China Sea the probability = 13%*3%*99%+1%=1.4% Overall the probability of lethal confrontation in either region is 1-(1-7.1%)(1-1.4%)=8.4%.

Today we are witnessing the creation of such islands with technology generation 0. Who is to say what (and where) such islands might look like in a decade or so with generation X technologies. It's a great opportunity for international collaboration that has, unfortunately, failed to materialize. Lacking this, I expect that Samantha Power, United States Ambassador to the United Nations, will be making the following declaration shortly: \"It is the policy of the United States to promote .... Therefore, should China refuse to renounce all territorial claims to such artificial islands .... The United States will forcibly remove all inhabitants and permanently dismantle and destroy such artificial islands, reserving to our prerogative any means necessary to do so. In addition, should such action become necessary, we will hold China responsible for paying the full and complete cost of such removal.\" Fix'd. :) Alternatively, we could let China (and others) move forward uncontested with such shenanigans and invest heavily in the soon to be announced IPO R\u00ec j\u00ecn d\u00f2u j\u012bn Island Creation Corporation, whose plans including dropping casinos on manmade islands within 25 miles of the top ten worldwide population centers within the next ten years."], [12029, "2016-01-03T20:22:47Z", [0.12], ""], [14516, "2016-01-03T19:57:46Z", [0.35], "Too many countries now involved here, so someone could make a mistake, but probability still less than 50:50 at present"], [14208, "2016-01-03T19:39:14Z", [0.11], ""], [11686, "2016-01-03T17:21:08Z", [0.15], ""], [691, "2016-01-03T14:07:30Z", [0.12], "After the latest kerfuffle, one supposes the Filipinos are pretty constantly on the phone with Washington to see what happens if either the Philippines or China moves beyond quacking and flapping.

Since mid-2014, The People's Liberation Army Navy agreed to abide by the Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea, which establishes common protocols for interactions between naval vessels to reduce accidents. In September of 2015, the PRC signed a bilateral agreement with the US governing air-to-air encounters as well as protocols governing the use of the Defense Telephone Link. The two navies are also in the process of hammering out a set of rules on ship-to-ship encounters. What is most notable about these newly stabilized US-PRC military-to-military ties is that they come during a period of tumult between the two, as well as China's neighbors. Under President Xi, Chinese incursions in the Japanese-controlled Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands have increased. China also declared an ADIZ over the East China Sea while accelerating land reclamation in the South China Sea.  This is partly due to the fact that the People's Liberation Army itself appears to have shifted its attitudes and now believes that military-to-military ties with the United States can bring it tangible benefits. At the same time, China's top political leadership now recognizes the need for more tools to manage disputes.

The other part of this is the question, \"Will the US risk nuclear war over Taiwan?\"  I think the resounding political answer to that question is \"NO!\".  You see it would be risking a nuclear war because our forces have been hollowed out by two wars and a much more serious budget fiasco known as the Sequester.  We don't have enough conventional forces in either Europe or Asia to fight anyone for control of sea lanes or much of anything else.  Our only reliable Asian ally with military teeth is South Korea which is easily isolated and brought under attack by the Chinese and their North Korean ally.  Japan may be willing but they simply don't have the military to lend much to the fight.  I know that all of the sailors reading this are saying, \"Poppycock!  The US Seventh Fleet is the most powerful naval force in the entire world.\"  To which I say, \"Yes it is and it is also the largest collection of targets for surface to surface missiles in the world.\"  The Chinese have been constructing unsinkable aircraft carriers in the South China Sea.  Those newly built islands armed with batteries of surface to surface missiles denies the US Navy use of at least a 1000 miles of the Western Pacific between Midway, the Philippines and Japan.  The accuracy and lethality of the new generation of surface to surface missiles have made aircraft carriers a wasting asset in the same manner that the carriers made the battleships obsolete.  I would trade a $200,000 missile for a billion dollar aircraft carrier any day of the war.   Lastly, if the Chinese economy continues its downward trend the Party Elite will get extremely nervous.  The time tested formula for a cure for that nervousness is to start a war, remember the Argentine Junta and the Falkland Islands invasion, to divert attention from the problems at home.  A reunification with Taiwan would be just the ticket needed to make the Party Leaders look like heroes.  So for now a 50% chance of a lethal confrontation; but, after the Taiwan elections in a few months I may be ready to change my prediction."], [689, "2015-11-05T02:23:28Z", [0.01], "Comment deleted on May 10, 2016 06:52PM UTC"], [9783, "2015-11-05T01:54:48Z", [0.03], ""], [8098, "2015-11-05T01:52:37Z", [0.0], "There is no benefit to any party."], [1337, "2015-11-05T01:47:35Z", [0.25], "The Nobel laureate feels tempted to escalate this conflict, but the Chinese are unlikely to participate if the American involvement remains symbolic."], [10936, "2015-11-05T01:32:39Z", [0.15], ""], [10938, "2015-11-05T01:30:38Z", [0.1], "My rationale is that there may be a conflict but cyber warfare would most likely happen.

None of your business, it says to its neighbors whose fishing industries depend upon those reefs.  Does China really want a shooting war over its destruction of the Spratleys reefs? Its enemy of, oh, the last thousand years or so, namely Vietnam with its huge fishing industry, and Vietnam's ally, Russia, are planning for the worst by adding submarines and military aircraft to Vietnam's arsenal. China had better watch out for what Russia and Vietnam could stage out of Cam Ran Bay. How ironic it would be if the U.S., Russia and Vietnam were to become allies in a shooting war with China. Also improbable, IMHO. My gut feeling, looking all these factors, is that China will back down. Consider, for example, that this Saturday, Xi and Taiwan's president will meet in Singapore, for the first China/Taiwan summit since the two separated in 1949. This is HUGE! Why mess up the pooch (or something like that) when China is making progress with its carrots policy.

The submarines are part of a Vietnamese effort to deter China's military amid an ongoing dispute over the South China Sea, a maritime expanse considered rich in resources that is highly valuable for commercial shipping. In addition to the six Kilo-class submarines from Russia, Vietnam has bought accompanying Russian-made missiles, of the Klub variety, that can attack land and could potentially reach coastal cities in China, Reuters reported in April. The missiles could also attack Chinese ships and submarines. \"They've given themselves a much more powerful deterrent that complicates China's strategic calculations,\" Carl Thayer, an expert on the Vietnamese military at the Australian Defence Force Academy, told Reuters.  http://www.ibtimes.com/amid-chinese-military-aggression-russia-delivers-submarine-vietnam-defense-over-south-1989783 Books: Asia's Cauldron: the South China Sea and the End of a Stable Pacific, by Robert D.

Vietnam, Philippines and other nations' navies and coast guard are less coordinated with command and lack a coordinated, front line civilian maritime element to confront foreign civilian vessels in disputed waters. Herien lies a greater risk for lethal confrontation with Chinese civilian vessels. But Chinese fishing and other civilian maritime vessels tend to be backed up by sate naval and / or coast guard assets, thereby reducing a chance for a lethal confrontation involving Vietnamese, Philippine or other naval coast guard vessels. The elephant of the US navy makes it difficult and disadvantageous for China to engage in any potential military confrontation in disputed waters/ islands in S or E China sea for the immediate future. Japan's new interpretation of its pacifist constitution and the alliance withe US makes any E China sea confrontation unlikely. The Philippine navy is too weak and almost totally relies on the US which lowers any risk of lethal confrontation with its naval or coast guard forces. Vietnam is more exposed and poses the greatest risk, but it is growing closer to the US militarily and economically quickly and may be in position to expect US backing in the coming few years.

But I continue to question the strategy. Let's play a game........suppose China decides to enter into a multi-national negotiation of South China Sea and this is eventually completed. At that point, a huge amount of contention and bad will are removed from the table and the ability to move forward economically and in in other partnerships are greatly facilitated. And wouldn't that help them with other negotiations such as RCEP, etc.? On the other hand, let us say they decide to confront each country, the UN bodies ruling on the SC Seas, etc, etc.  How does that promote trust and facilitate their route to greater standing? To me, this undercuts their pursuit of stability (internal and external) by making things more chaotic externally.
