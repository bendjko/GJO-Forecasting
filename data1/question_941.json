Also, I get that it\u2019s very easy for me to come in late on in this stage and say \u2018not happening\u2019, whereas most of you have been forecasting for over a year\u2026so again, sorry about that. I appreciate your forecasts! I have several questions about this and have probably been very lazy with my research. \nFirstly, how is the Minsk II still considered relevant? Annex 1, No,2: \u201cThe withdrawal of heavy weapons as specified above is to start on day 2 of the ceasefire at the latest and be completed within 14 days\u201d (http://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/s_res_2202.pdf) . \nSeeing as this ceasefire was supposed to start 0000 on 15 February 2015, I would say that it is not possible to meet the heavy weaponry withdrawal as specified in the Minsk II as it is now 18th September 2019? So, am I missing something here? As @teidi said, Minsk III next.  Secondly, the separatist forces I assume are the armed factions in the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic (DPR) and the Luhansk People\u2019s Republic (LPR). And again, I am assuming that it is the DPR and LPR occupied areas of Donetsk and Luhansk which is classed as non-governmental territory by the OSCE. (If I\u2019m wrong, please correct me). As the most recent quarterly assessment by the OSCE (https://www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/425429?download=true) demonstrated 1269 weapons in violation of withdrawal lines (are these heavy weapons?), 79% of which occurred in non-governmental territory, it doesn\u2019t seem like the separatist forces are going to withdraw their weapons. Especially as this was a 67% increase compared to the first quarter.  Taking into consideration the motivation of the people of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions and their fight for independence, why would they stop fighting now? Especially after the Russian government has taken steps to, let\u2019s say\u2026encourage the DPR and LPR to separate from Ukraine.  Finally, I don\u2019t know how long the verification process would take, but if the OSCE felt confident enough to make a statement verifying this, then they must have already started the verification process (an added caveat being @dcm\u2019s comment on access to sites). Based on the daily updates by the SMM, it doesn\u2019t seem likely before the 1st October.  I will work on answering my own questions, but if anyone has any input that would be great. \n"], [691, "2019-09-17T10:39:55Z", [0.0], ""], [63401, "2019-09-16T13:34:11Z", [0.0], " The respective parties are still getting ready for the  next round of meetings in the Normandy format;  therefore, meeting the conditions \u201dyes\u201d  are all the impossible at this point. https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-polytics/2781090-zelensky-names-three-major-issues-for-normandy-format-summit.html"], [79464, "2019-09-15T21:29:39Z", [0.0], ""], [63401, "2019-09-15T13:39:36Z", [0.0], "No, it won't happen within the timeframe of the question.

On the evening and night of 15-16 July, the SMM camera at the Donetsk Filtration Station (DFS) (15km north of Donetsk) recorded, in sequence, a projectile and a flare in flight from west to east and six projectiles from north-north-west to south-south-east, followed by a total of 35 projectiles (12 in vertical flight, eight from east to west, 11 from north-west to south-east and four from north-north-west to south-south-east) and one undetermined explosion, all 0.7-5km south. On the evening and night of 15-16 July, the SMM camera at the entry-exit checkpoint in Marinka (government-controlled, 23km south-west of Donetsk) recorded, in sequence, six illumination flares in vertical flight and a projectile in flight from west to east, followed by a total of ten undetermined explosions, 61 projectiles (seven from north to south, 17 from east to west, one from south to north, two from west-north-west to east-north-east and 34 from west to east), five illumination flares in vertical flight, a muzzle flash and a burst, all 2-5km north. On the evening and night of 15-16 July, the SMM camera at the entry-exit checkpoint in Pyshchevyk (government-controlled, 25km north-east of Mariupol) recorded, in sequence, 18 projectiles in flight from east to west, two projectiles from west to east and 11 projectiles from east to west, all 4-9km south. During the day on 16 July, positioned about 1km north-west of the railway station in Yasynuvata (non-government-controlled, 16km north-east of Donetsk), the SMM heard and saw three undetermined explosions 2-4km south-west and west-south-west, and heard four undetermined explosions 2-4km south-west and north-north-west, as well as 23 bursts and shots of small-arms and heavy-machine-gun fire, all 1-3km south-west and west-south-west. During the day on 16 July, positioned on the south-eastern outskirts of Avdiivka (government-controlled, 17km north of Donetsk), the SMM heard 22 undetermined explosions and 24 shots of small-arms fire, all 1-4km at directions ranging from north-east to south. In Luhansk region, the SMM recorded more ceasefire violations, including a similar number of explosions, compared with the previous reporting period (two explosions). The SMM continued to monitor the disengagement process and to pursue full access to the disengagement areas near Stanytsia Luhanska (16km north-east of Luhansk), Zolote (60km west of Luhansk) and Petrivske (41km south of Donetsk)[2], as foreseen in the Framework Decision of the Trilateral Contact Group relating to disengagement of forces and hardware of 21 September 2016. The SMM\u2019s access remained restricted, but the Mission was able to partially monitor them.* On the evening and night of 15-16 July, the SMM camera in Zolote recorded, in sequence, eight bursts and two undetermined explosions all 3.5-7km south-east, south-south-east and south (all assessed as outside the disengagement area). During the day on 16 July, positioned in and near the Stanytsia Luhanska disengagement area, the SMM observed a calm situation. The SMM continued to monitor the withdrawal of weapons in implementation of the Memorandum and the Package of Measures and its Addendum. In violation of withdrawal lines, in government-controlled areas, on 14 July, an SMM long-range unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) spotted two self-propelled howitzers (2S3 Akatsiya, 152mm) near Keramik (28km north-west of Donetsk). On 15 July, an SMM mini-UAV spotted two self-propelled howitzers (2S1 Gvozdika, 122mm) near Putylyne (44km north-west of Luhansk). In non-government-controlled areas, on 14 July, an SMM long-range UAV spotted three tanks (one T-64 and two possible T-64) in a residential area of Verkhnoshyrokivske (85km south of Donetsk) and 12 tanks (type undetermined) about 2km north of Svobodne (73km south of Donetsk). Beyond withdrawal lines but outside designated storage sites in a non-government-controlled area, on 14 July, an SMM long-range UAV spotted four tanks (possible T-72) west of Markyne (94km south of Donetsk). The SMM observed armoured combat vehicles[3] and other indications of military-type presence in the security zone. In government-controlled areas, on 14 July, an SMM long-range UAV spotted four infantry fighting vehicles (IFV) (one BMP-2 and three BMP variants) near Novohryhorivka (55km south of Donetsk), an IFV (BMP-2) near Bohdanivka (41km south-west of Donetsk), an IFV (BMP-2) and an armoured personnel carrier (APC) (MT-LB) in Taramchuk (29km south-west of Donetsk), two IFVs (BMP variants) near Slavne (26km south-west of Donetsk), an APC (BTR variant) in Krasnohorivka (21km west of Donetsk). On 14 July, an SMM mid-range UAV spotted four IFVs (two BMP-1 and two BMP-2) near Nelipivka (40km north-east of Donetsk). On the same day, an SMM mini-UAV spotted an IFV (BMP-2) near Hranitne (60km south of Donetsk). On 16 July, the SMM saw an APC (BTR variant) near Zolote-2/Karbonit (62km west of Luhansk), an IFV (BMP variant) and a newly dug trench in Zolote-4/Rodina (59km west of Luhansk), an APC (MB-LB) in Trokhizbenka (32km north-west of Luhansk), as well as seven APCs (BTR-80) near Popasna (69km west of Luhansk). In non-government-controlled areas, on 14 July, an SMM long-range UAV spotted three APCs (two BTR-80 and an MT-LB) and four IFVs (BMP-1) in Bezimenne (non-government-controlled, 30km east of Mariupol), six IFVs (BMP-2) in Khreshchatytske (86km south of Donetsk), a probable TORN radio intelligence system in a residential area of Maiorove (formerly Krasnyi Oktiabr, 57km south-east of Donetsk) (see SMM Daily Report of 9 June 2018) and an APC (BTR-80) near Styla (34km south of Donetsk). The SMM observed the presence of mines and mine hazard signs. An SMM mid-range UAV again spotted at least 300 anti-tank mines laid in two rows near Nelipivka (see SMM Daily Report of 29 June 2018). On the side of a road leading from Solodke (government-controlled, 33km south-west of Donetsk) to Olhynka (government-controlled, 40km south-west of Donetsk), the SMM saw for the first time a rectangular mine hazard sign (with \u201cNo entry, demining activities\u201d written in Ukrainian). ..."], [691, "2018-07-16T14:36:07Z", [0.0], ""], [28414, "2018-07-15T19:04:37Z", [0.03], ""], [28813, "2018-07-15T18:27:46Z", [0.09], ""], [12591, "2018-07-15T16:30:39Z", [0.05], ""], [691, "2018-07-12T12:36:01Z", [0.0], ""], [37236, "2018-07-10T22:30:27Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2018-07-09T16:34:25Z", [0.0], ""], [1333, "2018-07-07T18:26:31Z", [0.01], ""], [35636, "2018-07-07T06:25:09Z", [0.0], "Comment deleted on Jul 07, 2018 04:33PM UTC"], [172, "2018-07-06T21:14:22Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2018-07-06T20:32:51Z", [0.0], ""], [35636, "2018-07-06T08:16:54Z", [0.0], "114 from 65.

There live Ukrainians, who have not accepted the ousting of the legally elected president, which was possible only with the help of USA.  The main contributing factor to the loss of trust to those international organizations is the  behavior of the USA - its is obeying to decisions of the international organizations only, if it fits it's national interests. If i.e. the UN does what the US wants - that's good, if not, USA doesn't care and does any way what it wants.  \nThis behavior shatters the international system of institutions, which was designed after uncounted wars to solve the various conflicts on the base of law and negotiations - a system, which grants protection for small countries, a system which was designed to prevent big and strong countries to solve their problems at the cost of weaker nations.\nThe second problem is, that US has taken control of international institutions, which were set up to function as independent specialized international bodies, who will be trusted from all nations, independently of their conflicts among each other. There are many examples - like the OPCW, Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, and other, like the anti doping organization.\nIn a highly politicized conflict against Russia the USA lead \"West\" countries have manipulated the results of the above mentioned bodies and have done a tremendous damage to the very foundation of the modern globalized world.\nThis has triggered an earthquake for the international relations, which will settle only then, when new rules of engagement will be established.
