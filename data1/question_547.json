Jan 16\nFeb 76\nMarch 24\nApril 121\nMay 343\nJune 47\nJuly 63 Of the 343 deaths that occured in May, 229 occured in clashes between government forces supported by RSF militia and SLA-MM supported by SLA-Transitional Council forces (a splinter faction of SLA-AW) on 20 May in Musbat and Wadi Howar of North Darfur. If we assume that such a battle is an exception and won't occur in August, it might be reasonable to only count 114 deaths in May, which would lead to an average of  2,12 deaths per day. For the remaining of August, this would mean that 55 deaths could be expected. I won't put too much weight on that number, because there might be big fluctuation. There are no fixed battlelines and an abundance of possible actors. 49 of the 64 deaths in July, for example, died in only two days of clashes between the Ma\u2019alia and Rizeigat tribes in El Mejlid and Donki Umarag. Tribal violence is hard to predict. If that clash hadn't occured, there might have only been 15 deaths in July. At the same time, it is easily imaginable that another tribal clash  or fighting between the gov. and rebels might have occured, raising the number to those of April.
