In hindsight, the move makes sense, as most hindsight views :). Looking at my forecasts, I draw two lessons:  - the human mind craves certainty. Even though we are taught to think in probabilities, this creates discomfort, and we the forecasters constantly look for ways to extremize our forecasts. I myself have more than my fair share of 0 and 100 percent forecasts. The trouble is that most of the time this strategy works - near-certain or near-uncertain events materialize with the expected frequency, which feeds this tendency to extremize.

However, balancing this is the fact that it would hardly be desirable to go to the polls just as we are about to go into Brexit negotiations. In addition, May by her very nature is a cautious player and would place the risk ahead of the benefits. And the biggest risk is that the elections would be seen as a re-run of the referendum.

If she is confident in her ability to negotiate, if she is likely to be successful and if there isn't some sort of flare-up between the UK and the EU, then she might well be feeling that she can bide her time.

If they do, she might exploit the opportunity to go to the country while Labour are at their most vulnerable. So overall, I think an election is unlikely under prevailing conditions. However if the Labour Party was it implode, then she might be tempted to increase her majority in parliament. If labour imploded I would then change the probability of an election to about 25-35%. Her decision would however be tempered by the standing of both UKip and the Liberals, either of who if strong, would lead to a reining in of the temptation to go to an election. The following matrix would in my view hold:  If after Stoke Labour collapses, Liberals win and UKIP doesn't: 25% elections\nIf after Stoke Labour collapses, Liberals don't win and UKIP does: 35% elections\nIf after Stoke Labour doesn't collapse, Liberals dont win and UKIP does: 0% elections\nIf after Stoke Labour doesn't collapse, Liberals win and UKIP doesn't: 0% elections."], [368, "2017-02-10T21:19:13Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-02-10T19:36:52Z", [0.01], ""], [33590, "2017-02-10T17:40:31Z", [0.1], ""], [12302, "2017-02-10T12:22:34Z", [0.07], ""], [31395, "2017-02-10T11:44:10Z", [0.11], ""], [691, "2017-02-10T03:09:39Z", [0.01], ""], [32766, "2017-02-09T21:43:02Z", [0.15], ""], [368, "2017-02-09T21:10:34Z", [0.0], ""], [29587, "2017-02-09T20:02:42Z", [0.03], "Down.

So we come to forced situations, which I think are likewise unlikely.  It seems likely the Supreme Court will require an Act of Parliament to trigger Article 50 but MPs have given a strong indication they're willing to pass it to enable Article 50 notification. If MPs won't pass this then things get interesting and May might be forced to call an election and could probably secure enough MPs to run through a motion of no confidence, I rate that as unlikely though. If a motion of no confidence is passed the government has 14 days to pass a motion of confidence, so the date for action is by the 18th June, that's 11 weeks from the end of May and 11 weeks before any effective plotting could take place, plus the parliamentary time it would take to table the motion.

My previous forecast was founded on base rates with some adjustments, but I have come to tentatively think that base rates are most useful when outcomes are dictated by many more-or-less unrelated factors (law of large numbers, central limit theorem, etc) --- especially when there may be many factors we are unaware of. But in cases such as this one, where everything comes down to the decisions of the British government --- in particular, the highly correlated MPs --- other ways of thinking may be more predictive. My new analysis is fairly simple. What would cause the government to call new elections? Since snap elections are very unusual, presumably they would only be called over the very unusual thing happening right now --- Brexit. Whether it be the invocation of Article 50 or the eventual precise terms of Brexit, the sitting government might call snap elections to elect new MPs and get its way. But here's the thing. The MPs that would be hypothetically getting in the way of government, refusing to vote for A50 or Brexit or whatever --- would they vote to give themselves a chance to lose their jobs? In one scenario, MPs are voting for what May wants. No snap elections in that world. In another scenario, MPs are being difficult and a majority of them are not voting the way May wants. Why would that majority vote against their own jobs? Especially since being difficult about Brexit would mean a higher chance of being voted out of office? Moreover, the Conservative party currently holds a narrow but real majority. Why would they risk losing that? (Opinion polling currently stands more or less exactly where it was for the May 2015 elections which gave them that narrow majority [1].) This line of reasoning suggests a very small chance (0%-1%) of snap elections, not just before 1 July 2017, but over almost any timeframe. It is backed, in a way, by the very short-term base rate of snap elections since the 2011 change of rules for snap elections. Since the rule change, there have been no snap elections. Since I'm not sure what kind of reasoning is more predictive here --- base rates or \"game theory\" --- I will average their predicted odds: (0+10)/2 = 5%. I further adjust this down to 4% because it is still possible that the Supreme Court will rule in favor of May and obviate the need for snap elections.

The first issue to consider is whether this is even feasible.  Assumption One: The Conservative Party would be the political player that makes this happen (as we shall see, no other party has enough seats or sway to make this happen right now).  So, the Tories have three options: 1) Vote of no-confidence in itself, 2) Vote for early GE through super-majority, 3) Repeal FPTA, 4) Pass a bill bypassing FTPA for just this *one* time.   I think that path 4) is the most likely option since it is the most achievable and the option that loses the least political face.  Option 2) seems impossible by the date set.  Option 1) and 3) are possible but seem a lot harder to rationalize (some might plump for option 3) over 4), they amount to the same end point --> we could just clump 3) and 4) together and say \"pass bill allowing GE\", doesn't matter!).   Anyway, I already think this is unlikely to happen - I'd give it a 30% chance. Inside View and Indicators:\n1. Conservatives lost Richmond on a Brexit vote.  TM might see this as an opportunity because in other constituencies Conservatives will win on a Brexit vote.\n2. Gerrymandering --> Conservatives are trying to change the Commons from 650 to 600 MPs which would favor them.  This wouldn't happen till 2018 so would May wait until then or go ahead now and assume a victory.\n3. By-election in Copeland in early 2017 for a Labour seat.  If Conservatives take Copeland that would be a huge score, this doesn't usually happen (sitting govt. takes seat from opposition).\n4. Theresa May seems to me to want to sit on everything until after Article 50, she wants to implement her plan or has no plan.  I still thinks she wants time (well past 7.1.17). With these opposing indicators I would give it 50%. This takes us to 15% for now.  Copeland will be an important indicator or also any noises from Conservative politicians (I haven't seen anything as of yet)."], [691, "2016-12-24T16:37:27Z", [0.02], ""], [31688, "2016-12-24T14:18:52Z", [0.4], ""], [26243, "2016-12-24T10:31:48Z", [0.21], ""], [10898, "2016-12-24T07:14:50Z", [0.14], ""], [5180, "2016-12-24T03:43:37Z", [0.1], "The outlook and world politics are changing in all countries.

I cannot see the first scenario because that requires agreement from both the tories and labour, and Corbyn wouldn't know a political deal if one slapped him.

Trying to call a no confidence vote in itself would require the government to have almost full support of its MPs and/or all non-Tory MPs to not oppose it. \nThere are obvious reasons why many MPs would be unwilling to vote for an early general election. The MPs were elected on their parties manifestos which reflected the general policies of their parties. Any early election would almost certainly become another referendum on Brexit. As has been seen with by-elections since July voters are no longer going to vote along predictable party lines, so a large but unpredictable percentage of sitting MPs would be at risk of being voted out. Tory MPs that support Brexit in places that voted to Remain would be at risk (as per Richmond Park). Tory MPs that supported Remain in places that voted to Leave might be at risk from UKIP, as might Labour MPs. Local tactical voting pacts (as at Richmond) might increase the risk of sitting Tories losing. It is unlikely that many MPs who thought they were in a safe seat would want to risk an early election. \nAt the moment there appears to be a majority of MPs who want a \"soft\" Brexit, an election could produce a House much more in favour of a \"hard\" Brexit.

Trying to call a no confidence vote in itself would require the government to have almost full support of its MPs and/or all non-Tory MPs to not oppose it. \nThere are obvious reasons why many MPs would be unwilling to vote for an early general election. The MPs were elected on their parties manifestos which reflected the general policies of their parties. Any early election would almost certainly become another referendum on Brexit. As has been seen with by-elections since July voters are no longer going to vote along predictable party lines, so a large but unpredictable percentage of sitting MPs would be at risk of being voted out. Tory MPs that support Brexit in places that voted to Remain would be at risk (as per Richmond Park). Tory MPs that supported Remain in places that voted  to Leave might be at risk from UKIP, as might Labour MPs. Local tactical voting pacts (as at Richmond) might increase the risk of sitting Tories losing. It is unlikely that many MPs who thought they were in a safe seat would want to risk an early election. \nAt the moment there appears to be a majority of MPs who want a \"soft\" Brexit, an election could produce a House much more in favour of a \"hard\" Brexit.

Even though today the court ruled that she could not enact Article 50 without it going through the parliament, the idea she would call for an early election without first trying to pass the article with the current parliament which currently has a majority (although not a strong one) in her favor on this subject, seems incongruent with her leadership style. She has stated in the past that she would like to start the Brexit talks by the end of March 2017 (ref: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/03/world/europe/brexit-talks-march-theresa-may-britain.html). This would lead me to believe that there would be no call for an early general election before that time (The government is going to appeal the ruling of the lower courts to their higher courts anyway so that will take time also). This leaves us with only April through June for the parliament to discuss Article 50 and how to best go about \"Brexiting\". Just as a little kicker for that short amount of time for the Parliament to discuss this complex topic, assuming they have roughly the same amount of days off as they did for last year (ref: http://www.parliament.uk/about/faqs/house-of-commons-faqs/business-faq-page/recess-dates/) they will be on vacation for roughly 41 of the 91 days of April through June. If PM May thinks that the Parliament can push through a complex and VERY emotionally charged and controversial Article in a Parliament that is not a very heavy majority for any party (ref: http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/lords/composition-of-the-lords/ and http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/mps/current-state-of-the-parties/), then I would argue that she is either an eternal optimist or na\u00efve, which I would suspect neither of her. Based on that I would think it will be very unlikely to see a call for an early general election before 1 July 2017. Another roadblock to this is that in order for a early general election to be called, according to the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 there needs to be either a vote of \"No confidence in Her Majesty's Government\" or there needs to a motion passed by 2/3 of the MPs (to include vacant seats). Mathematically, this would be quite difficult for the current majority party (the conservatives) because even if they could get EVERY vote except the Labor votes, they would still fall short of a 2/3 vote.

Whatever Government wishes it could to to speed along Brexit, it cannot trigger general elections on its own. Rather, as per the question information, elections are called as a result of various majorities in the House of Commons. From the parliament.uk link above [1], new elections may be called in one of two cases: (i) a motion of no confidence is passed in Her Majesty's Government by a simple majority and 14 days elapses without the House passing a confidence motion in any new Government formed; or (ii) a motion for a general election is agreed by two thirds of the total number of seats in the Commons including vacant seats (currently 434 out of 650) As I understand it, (ii) amounts to 2/3 of politicians voting themselves out of a job. I find this almost impossible. Let's say 2% chance. Regarding motions of no confidence, their base rate is very low. According to Wikipedia [2] there have only been 3 successful votes of no confidence since 1900, in 1924 and 1979. Let's call that a base rate of 3%. One could argue that the base rate is low because votes of no confidence happen during unusual times, and such times are rare; but we are in such a time now, which should raise the odds. On the other hand, even if a vote of no confidence succeeds, Government has 14 days to reorganize itself and get validation via a vote of confidence. I think MPs would prefer to do this rather than face election. Remember, the current batch were elected in 2015, before Trump, Brexit, etc. If I were a politician I would regard my own electoral future as very uncertain, and would try to avoid early elections. I don't know. Let's say we double, or even triple the base rate of 3%. Together with the 2% from earlier, that makes about 10% chance of new elections.

Theresa May currently has a majority.  Early general election might expand it, but also could backfire on her. At a high level, there are two paths - one is where she remains quite popular & polls continue to indicate she would pick up seats in a snap election.  The other is where she (/Brexit) becomes less popular, and may not pick up seats.  If we are on path 1, it also presumably means she has reasonable sway in parliament and can (within reason) get stuff done.  If we are on path 2, she might not have that sway, but also would not be helped by a new election.  The only scenario where an early general election helps her is one where she remains very popular in the polls, but yet has difficulty working with her own party to pass what she needs to on Brexit.  So much difficulty, in fact, that she's willing to backtrack on what she's already said and call a fairly dicey general election only ~1.5 yrs into a 5 yr term. IDK, I am cognizant that I know next to nothing about British politics (so would love it if someone thinks the above is wrong/stupid and points that out), but it seems to me like it's kind of a long shot that calling an election is going to be an expedient path for her.
