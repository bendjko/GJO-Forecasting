And \"Unbelievable\" in a different sense, as well.  The play that E. Hosmer made was a type of play that baseball has forgotten. Here is a description of the play (I lost the link):\n\"Salvador Perez hit a grounder to third that was fielded by Wright, who turned to freeze Hosmer at third. But when Wright threw, Hosmer broke for the plate, a move that was both risky and reckless. \"The way they run the bases, you can't be shocked by anything,'' Wright said. \"I'm sure that even Hosmer would say it was probably a bit reckless. But when you seem to kind of get the breaks and when you play the game that way, sometimes things like that work out for you.\" A good throw from Duda would have cut down Hosmer. A good throw would have sent the World Series back to Kansas City. A good throw would have allowed the Mets to escape their latest calamity. But Duda's throw sailed well to the right of catcher Travis d'Arnaud and went to the backstop. The Royals had tied it. A stunned Citi Field sat in silence. \"You've got to tip your hat to Hosmer there. It took some [guts] to do what he did,\" Duda said. \"It was an outstanding read and I didn't make the throw . . . like I said, no excuses. It's on me.\" ..... This is aggressive base running, demonstrating the type of decisions made, with \"fast thinking\", so unlike the \"slow thinking\" instilled in today's dull game by modern saber metrics.  \nThe type of play that Hosmer made, though rare in today's game is well documented in Ty Cobb's autobiography \"My life in Baseball\" Cobb played baseball in the first third of the 20th century. It is truly \"unbelievable\" that old style decision making has come back a century later to out do saber metrics.

I didn't include teams with odds of greater than 100 to 1).  According to Fangraphs [2], AL teams have a 49% chance of winning.  Both sources suggest a 50% estimate would be appropriate.  I'll go a shade above 50 because the AL will have home team advantage and has done better in inter-league matches. This question is very much unlike most GJP questions in that there is very little Knightian uncertainty [3] involved.  Any reasonable mathematical model (e.g. Fangraphs) will tell you that the odds are about 50-50.  In addition, there are well-developed betting markets that also suggest 50% odds.   Baseball is a very random game; even if the AL team will (on average) be very slightly better than the NL team, 7 games is simply not enough time for quality to overcome randomness.  An answer of 70% (for either side) is simply unreasonable; it is like predicting that a fair coin will land on heads with 70% probability.  I find it a bit disturbing that the GJP consensus is so obviously wrong.  Ideally, the GJP should be about reducing Knightian uncertainty, and it is hard to believe it can creditably do that if it can't get it right on questions like this.

I'm surprised that of all the questions that are currently live, for this one in particular, there are only 2 (!) links, but at least 4 pages of comments. Given the innumerable amount of stats one could possibly reference for a question about baseball, that's a little surprising.

As a fan of the Blue Jays (I remember the early 90s!), I didn't think I'd be able to answer the question without bias. Luckily, it's simply an AL/NL question, which still presents a bit of a problem, but not nearly as much as if we were trying to pick the winner out of 8 to 10 teams. I realize that I could probably write WAY too much in a rationale for this, so I'll be as brief as I can, while still adding value to the discussion.  One thing to consider when it comes to forecasting sports (in my experience) and in particular, baseball, is that there are innumerate statistics or perspectives that one could adopt. Predictably, one would unconsciously gravitate towards those that support preexisting beliefs.  ~\nWith that being said, I think that FanGraphs offers the best \"data-backed\" solution when it comes to predicting who'll win the WS. Here's a link (updates daily) with the percentages for each team's chance of winning the WS (along with playoffs percentages, etc.): http://www.fangraphs.com/coolstandings.aspx?type=2&lg=lg&date=current Unsurprisingly, if you add up the percentages in the AL and the percentages in the NL, they both amount to about 50%. Aside from that, the one thing that stands out is the % for the Dodgers. For those who follow baseball, this will make sense given the make-up of the Dodgers' pitching staff.  If I were really taking my time with this question, I'd game out who the Dodgers are likely to play in the NLDS (the Mets?) and look at the matchup between the two teams and then game that out against the Cardinals (who'll *probably* beat the NL WC team). In the AL, it's looking like it'll be the Royals who'll play one of the Yankees or the Rangers (i.e. the AL WC team), who'll then  likely play the Jays (who appear like they'll be playing the Astros).  From the baseball I've seen this year, I have a sneaky suspicion that the Dodgers won't make it past the NLCS (if they even get there!) and I really think the Jays can beat all the teams in the AL in a 7-game series. To this end, I think the only team that I'd bet on against the Jays in the WS is the Dodgers (because of the starting pitchers). ~ Alright, so that was probably a bit rambling in parts, but I tried to cut down on tangents. In short, I'm slightly favouring the AL -- for now. My prediction now is based on who I expect to make the playoffs in the AL (Royals, Jays, Yankees), who I think have a better chance of winning than the (Cardinals, Cubs, Mets)."], [129, "2015-09-09T01:02:51Z", [0.73, 0.27], "St. Louis just appears unstoppable and shows no sign of any slowing down.
