The Super Bowl doesn't really matter in this sense. (1) It's pure entertainment; (2 ) Independent of causes but correlated to historical trends\n\n--\nBut both 1 & 2 are important to my propensity toward a thesis about the world 12 months from now: Entertainment\n(1)  Pure entertainment has a cost.  Fortunately economist & advertisers breakdown behavior around large entertainment spectacles like the Super Bowl so some signals for a back of envelope Monet Carlo method is feasible. .........(a) Are Consumers spending more on entertainment?    ( sentiment of consumer spending & labor market since we're now at full employment )\n,........(b) Are business spending on ads or otherwise around the event?  ( belief consumer sentiment is high & spending )\n.........(c) What's the tolerance for counterfeit NFL merchandise is the market? ( more counterfeit = desire for low prices )\n.........(d) What's the level of alcohol and drinking habits?  ( I believe alcohol & cigarettes use are signs of stress & create more stress ) Independent of causes but correlated to historical trends\n(2) My propensity is the U.S. enters a recession between Fall 2016 & Fall 2017.  No big deal but given our psychology after '07-'08 that there's an over reaction. Wall Street is more likely bearish in years an old NFL team wins  - Denver Broncos.  So it'll be interesting to watch. .........(a) U.S.  financial markets are technically in a bear market now  ( there's a 53% probability a recession follows a markets bear market historically )\n.........(b) Q: Macro economic stability to absorb market correction to QE?  A: NO. Contributing are currency instability, systemic instability in the largest global economies & institutions, unintended consequence of QE like strong dollar & falling treasury bond rates, Europe/China's lack of liberal market principles, and exogenous geopolitical risks in in oil, trade, etc\n.........(c) In presidential election years GDP is normally up 6.5-7%  ...

The forecast method, however, predicted the opposite matchup (NE-ARI). A couple of thoughts on how I'd try to improve this method next time: I would account for both offense and defense (yd/pass attempt gained and allowed) and look at the margin of difference. Based on the outcomes during these playoffs, that difference may be more telling than yds/pass attempt alone. We'll see next year! Updating now that divisional games are complete: \nBased on remaining teams, NFC's chances have improved (based on methodology below). Won two and lost two on the predictions over the weekend. Based on remaining teams, predicting an ARI-NE super bowl with ARI winning. NFC's chances have increased based on the yards per pass attempt method. Predicting NE, PIT, ARI, and SEA advancing and a ARI-PIT super bowl using the method described below. If these four teams advance, the AFC's chances go up give the better yards per pass attempt numbers for the remaining teams, but the NFC would still be favored 56-44 in this case. In the team matchups, we again had a mixed bag on yards per attempt - PIT and SEA both had more yards per attempt that their opponents in losses, while NE and ARI both had a differential of 2.5+ yards per attempt more than their opponents, which is similar to last week's results. Updating now that the wildcard games are complete: \nNFC's chances have increased based on the yards per pass attempt method. Predicting NE, PIT, ARI, and SEA advancing and a ARI-PIT super bowl using the method described below. If these four teams advance, the AFC's chances go up give the better yards per pass attempt numbers for the remaining teams, but the NFC would still be favored 56-44 in this case. Looking back over the weekend, the AFC winners had better yards per pass attempt than the teams they beat while the NFC winners did not. The AFC winners were >3 yards per attempt better than the teams they beat, while the NFC teams were withing 1.5 yards of each other. Earlier commentary/rationale Editing original forecast now that playoff teams are final (rationale/method below). I'm still favoring NFC over AFC 53% to 47% when considering all playoff teams \nWhen you take the playoff teams that are above the league mean yards per passing attempt, the NFC is favored 53.5 to 46.5 for the AFC. Interesting that 4 of 6 playoff teams in each conference are above the mean. When I apply the same method to the individual matchups, I get the following winners: \nWeek 1 winners: KC 62-38 over HOU, CIN 50.2-49,8 over PIT, SEA 77-23 over MIN and WSH 79-21 over GB \nWeek 2 winners: CIN 64-36 over NE, KC 65-35 over DEN, ARI 52-48 over SEA, and CAR 52-48 over WSH \nWeek 3 winners: CIN 71-29 over KC, ARI 62-38 over CAR \nSuper Bowl: ARI 51-49 over CIN So as a group and in individual matchups, I come up with the NFC. As noted in the original forecast, there are certainly some questions about this method and I'm trying it out just to see how well or poorly it works. One thing that gives me pause is that I've got CIN going to the Super Bowl and they are basically a 50-50 chance in round one vs PIT, and Andy Dalton, who is most responsible for the CIN yards per passing attempt, is not playing. That one outcome would not change my prediction, it would just substitute PIT for CIN and we'd end up with a ARI-PIT super bowl with the same winner predicted. ****** \nOriginal note on method: This forecast is based on yards per pass attempt, which I have read is the single best predictor of wins in football. I compared the top 4 playoff teams (as of 12/29) in the AFC and NFC based on yards per pass attempt to the league average. The top 4 AFC teams are .95 standard deviations above the league mean, while the top 4 NFC teams are 1.24 standard deviations above the league mean. The difference in these results using a standard normal distribution is a 6% edge to the NFC. Based on the yards per attempt numbers, the top playoff teams are 1) Arizona 2) Cincinnati 3) Seattle 4) Pittsburgh, which raises some questions about this forecasting method - for example, what role does defense play, will Dalton be ready to play for Cincinnati, and will Pittsburgh even make the playoffs. I'll adjust the forecast when the playoff teams are set - barring major changes in yards per attempt exiting week 17, if Pittsburgh does not make the playoffs, it will increase the NFC's chances to 58%."], [12828, "2016-02-06T15:31:58Z", [0.49, 0.51], ""], [19322, "2016-02-06T15:01:01Z", [0.61, 0.39], ""], [691, "2016-02-06T14:18:17Z", [0.78, 0.22], ""], [19024, "2016-02-06T12:49:47Z", [0.67, 0.33], ""], [1019, "2016-02-06T11:51:11Z", [0.85, 0.15], "Cam Newton is highly mobile; Manning isn't.

The zebras (Ed Hochulei crew) made at least one bad call that could have changed the momentum of the game toward the Pats. The question remains as to whether Gary Kubiak's coaching and motivation can avoid the recurring issue of some teams playing their best game in the Conference finals and then somehow not \"bringing it\" in the Big Game for the Lombardi Trophy. Ron Rivera is a native Californian and played on a winning Super Bowl team (1985 Bears) and as head coach, he turned the Panthers into a winner. Kubiak is a Texan who has been mentored by John Elway spent his entire career with the Broncos as Elway's backup, so he knows the tradition and culture.  Tough to say that either coach (and coaching staff) will \"outcoach\" the other. With Arizona out of the picture, the NFL has the \"east-west\" TV matchup that brings in the big audiences that advertisers like. But to me, personally, I see the Panthers as a faster team, with more offensive weapons. Unless Newton is carted off the field, they should win.

In the team matchups, we again had a mixed bag on yards per attempt - PIT and SEA both had more yards per attempt that their opponents in losses, while NE and ARI both had a differential of 2.5+ yards per attempt more than their opponents, which is similar to last week's results.  Updating now that the wildcard games are complete:\nNFC's chances have increased based on the yards per pass attempt method. Predicting NE, PIT, ARI, and SEA advancing and a ARI-PIT super bowl using the method described below. If these four teams advance, the AFC's chances go up give the better yards per pass attempt numbers for the remaining teams, but the NFC would still be favored 56-44 in this case. Looking back over the weekend, the AFC winners had better yards per pass attempt than the teams they beat while the NFC winners did not. The AFC winners were >3 yards per attempt better than the teams they beat, while the NFC teams were withing 1.5 yards of each other. Earlier commentary/rationale Editing original forecast now that playoff teams are final (rationale/method below). I'm still favoring NFC over AFC 53% to 47% when considering all playoff teams \nWhen you take the playoff teams that are above the league mean yards per passing attempt, the NFC is favored 53.5 to 46.5 for the AFC. Interesting that 4 of 6 playoff teams in each conference are above the mean. When I apply the same method to the individual matchups, I get the following winners: \nWeek 1 winners: KC 62-38 over HOU, CIN 50.2-49,8 over PIT, SEA 77-23 over MIN and WSH 79-21 over GB \nWeek 2 winners: CIN 64-36 over NE, KC 65-35 over DEN, ARI 52-48 over SEA, and CAR 52-48 over WSH \nWeek 3 winners: CIN 71-29 over KC, ARI 62-38 over CAR \nSuper Bowl: ARI 51-49 over CIN So as a group and in individual matchups, I come up with the NFC. As noted in the original forecast, there are certainly some questions about this method and I'm trying it out just to see how well or poorly it works. One thing that gives me pause is that I've got CIN going to the Super Bowl and they are basically a 50-50 chance in round one vs PIT, and Andy Dalton, who is most responsible for the CIN yards per passing attempt, is not playing. That one outcome would not change my prediction, it would just substitute PIT for CIN and we'd end up with a ARI-PIT super bowl with the same winner predicted. ****** \nOriginal note on method: This forecast is based on yards per pass attempt, which I have read is the single best predictor of wins in football. I compared the top 4 playoff teams (as of 12/29) in the AFC and NFC based on yards per pass attempt to the league average. The top 4 AFC teams are .95 standard deviations above the league mean, while the top 4 NFC teams are 1.24 standard deviations above the league mean. The difference in these results using a standard normal distribution is a 6% edge to the NFC. Based on the yards per attempt numbers, the top playoff teams are 1) Arizona 2) Cincinnati 3) Seattle 4) Pittsburgh, which raises some questions about this forecasting method - for example, what role does defense play, will Dalton be ready to play for Cincinnati, and will Pittsburgh even make the playoffs. I'll adjust the forecast when the playoff teams are set - barring major changes in yards per attempt exiting week 17, if Pittsburgh does not make the playoffs, it will increase the NFC's chances to 58%."], [15885, "2016-01-18T20:26:41Z", [0.65, 0.35], "Carolina will win...superior combination of defensive and offensive lines."], [11312, "2016-01-18T20:04:20Z", [0.65, 0.35], "Reducing odds a little for NFC due to Seahawks loss."], [10898, "2016-01-18T19:58:42Z", [0.57, 0.43], ""], [11040, "2016-01-18T19:39:43Z", [0.61, 0.39], ""], [14531, "2016-01-18T18:40:01Z", [0.55, 0.45], "I'm changing my forecast to reflect similar changes by Nate Silver and co.* * http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2015-nfl-predictions/"], [15857, "2016-01-18T16:50:56Z", [1.0, 0.0], ""], [7972, "2016-01-18T16:17:38Z", [0.15, 0.85], "Tom Brady and The New England Patriots are pretty unstoppable.

Predicting NE, PIT, ARI, and SEA advancing and a ARI-PIT super bowl using the method described below. If these four teams advance, the AFC's chances go up give the better yards per pass attempt numbers for the remaining teams, but the NFC would still be favored 56-44 in this case. Looking back over the weekend, the AFC winners had better yards per pass attempt than the teams they beat while the NFC winners did not. The AFC winners were >3 yards per attempt better than the teams they beat, while the NFC teams were withing 1.5 yards of each other. Earlier commentary/rationale Editing original forecast now that playoff teams are final (rationale/method below). I'm still favoring NFC over AFC 53% to 47% when considering all playoff teams \nWhen you take the playoff teams that are above the league mean yards per passing attempt, the NFC is favored 53.5 to 46.5 for the AFC. Interesting that 4 of 6 playoff teams in each conference are above the mean. When I apply the same method to the individual matchups, I get the following winners: \nWeek 1 winners: KC 62-38 over HOU, CIN 50.2-49,8 over PIT, SEA 77-23 over MIN and WSH 79-21 over GB \nWeek 2 winners: CIN 64-36 over NE, KC 65-35 over DEN, ARI 52-48 over SEA, and CAR 52-48 over WSH \nWeek 3 winners: CIN 71-29 over KC, ARI 62-38 over CAR \nSuper Bowl: ARI 51-49 over CIN So as a group and in individual matchups, I come up with the NFC. As noted in the original forecast, there are certainly some questions about this method and I'm trying it out just to see how well or poorly it works. One thing that gives me pause is that I've got CIN going to the Super Bowl and they are basically a 50-50 chance in round one vs PIT, and Andy Dalton, who is most responsible for the CIN yards per passing attempt, is not playing. That one outcome would not change my prediction, it would just substitute PIT for CIN and we'd end up with a ARI-PIT super bowl with the same winner predicted. ****** \nOriginal note on method: This forecast is based on yards per pass attempt, which I have read is the single best predictor of wins in football. I compared the top 4 playoff teams (as of 12/29) in the AFC and NFC based on yards per pass attempt to the league average. The top 4 AFC teams are .95 standard deviations above the league mean, while the top 4 NFC teams are 1.24 standard deviations above the league mean. The difference in these results using a standard normal distribution is a 6% edge to the NFC. Based on the yards per attempt numbers, the top playoff teams are 1) Arizona 2) Cincinnati 3) Seattle 4) Pittsburgh, which raises some questions about this forecasting method - for example, what role does defense play, will Dalton be ready to play for Cincinnati, and will Pittsburgh even make the playoffs. I'll adjust the forecast when the playoff teams are set - barring major changes in yards per attempt exiting week 17, if Pittsburgh does not make the playoffs, it will increase the NFC's chances to 58%."], [7757, "2016-01-11T23:24:58Z", [0.0, 1.0], "Emotion.

I'm still favoring NFC over AFC 53% to 47% when considering all playoff teams\nWhen you take the playoff teams that are above the league mean yards per passing attempt, the NFC is favored 53.5 to 46.5 for the AFC. Interesting that 4 of 6 playoff teams in each conference are above the mean. When I apply the same method to the individual matchups, I get the following winners:\nWeek 1 winners: KC 62-38 over HOU, CIN 50.2-49,8 over PIT, SEA 77-23 over MIN and WSH 79-21 over GB\nWeek 2 winners: CIN 64-36 over NE, KC 65-35 over DEN, ARI 52-48 over SEA, and CAR 52-48 over WSH\nWeek 3 winners: CIN 71-29 over KC, ARI 62-38 over CAR\nSuper Bowl: ARI 51-49 over CIN So as a group and in individual matchups, I come up with the NFC. As noted in the original forecast, there are certainly some questions about this method and I'm trying it out just to see how well or poorly it works. One thing that gives me pause is that I've got CIN going to the Super Bowl and they are basically a 50-50 chance in round one vs PIT, and Andy Dalton, who is most responsible for the CIN yards per passing attempt, is not playing. That one outcome would not change my prediction, it would just substitute PIT for CIN and we'd end up with a ARI-PIT super bowl with the same winner predicted. ******\nOriginal note on method: This forecast is based on yards per pass attempt, which I have read is the single best predictor of wins in football.  I compared the top 4 playoff teams (as of 12/29) in the AFC and NFC based on yards per pass attempt to the league average. The top 4 AFC teams are .95 standard deviations above the league mean, while the top 4 NFC teams are 1.24 standard deviations above the league mean. The difference in these results using a standard normal distribution is a 6% edge to the NFC. Based on the yards per attempt numbers, the top playoff teams are 1) Arizona 2) Cincinnati 3) Seattle 4) Pittsburgh, which raises some questions about this forecasting method - for example, what role does defense play, will Dalton be ready to play for Cincinnati, and will Pittsburgh even make the playoffs.  I'll adjust the forecast when the playoff teams are set - barring major changes in yards per attempt exiting week 17, if Pittsburgh does not make the playoffs, it will increase the NFC's chances to 58%."], [14005, "2016-01-09T20:42:56Z", [0.35, 0.65], ""], [12048, "2016-01-09T19:19:14Z", [0.48, 0.52], ""], [368, "2016-01-09T19:17:33Z", [1.0, 0.0], ""], [14916, "2016-01-09T18:10:57Z", [0.57, 0.43], ""], [14916, "2016-01-09T18:00:14Z", [0.63, 0.37], ""], [691, "2016-01-09T17:31:18Z", [0.61, 0.39], ""], [10039, "2016-01-09T17:07:05Z", [0.55, 0.45], ""], [241, "2016-01-09T14:30:47Z", [0.75, 0.25], ""], [11788, "2016-01-09T13:41:01Z", [1.0, 0.0], ""], [14841, "2016-01-09T03:17:13Z", [0.6, 0.4], "I think the NFC has to many SB winning possible teams, Carolina, Phoenix, Seattle, and Green Bay vs the AFC's New England and Pittsburgh."], [14821, "2016-01-09T02:23:31Z", [0.51, 0.49], "I'm a newbie here, so didn't plan to forecast football outcome, owing to lack of (much) knowledge.

In my mind, the source most likely to be reliable is the one having both expertise, experience, and skin in the game, so I thought of bookies.

I went to this site:  http://www.vegasinsider.com/nfl/odds/futures/ to get their \"ODDS TO WIN 2015 SUPER BOWL L\". I converted those odds to implied percentages using the \"Odds Converter Tool\" at this site:  http://www.bettingexpert.com/blog/how-to-convert-odds.

I then summed the odds for all AFC teams and for all NFC teams and divided each by 111.4%.  Result:  AFC = 0.486 and NFC = 0.514. Does this make sense?

The *best* team to make the playoffs doesn't always win the Super Bowl, especially if they run into an opponent that has their number. The four teams that are moving onto NEXT weekend's games (Denver, NE, Carolina, and Arizona). The matchups this weekend (with a quick prediction): Seattle @ Minnesota: Minny's D looked GREAT last night against the Packers, but the Packers have been having an off-year. Notably, Seattle beat up on Minny in early December (http://www.si.com/nfl/game/2015/12/06/seahawks-vikings-sunday-december-6th-2015). It's all a \"different ball game\" once you're in the playoffs (or so the #narratives would tell us). According to the Elo ratings, Seattle is a MUCH stronger team than Minny. SEATTLE wins by at least a TD. GB @ Washington: Washington is the NFC East's representative in the playoffs this season. The NFC East (this season) is not what it used to be. According to Elo ratings, GB is a MUCH stronger team. GB wins by at least a FG. KC @ HOU: Probably the most lopsided matchup of the games this weekend. KC scored nearly 100 points (!) more than Houston this year and allowed almost 40 fewer points. KC has won 10 (!) straight games. HOU is fortunate that its last two games of the year were against two of the worst teams this season (TEN and JAX) or else IND would probably be in this game and not HOU. KC's Elo score blows HOU's out of the water. KC wins by at least TWO TDs. PIT @ CIN: This is the only game where (to my mind) there is some ambiguity. Cincy's performance this season is, in part, tied to the success of their QB, Andy Dalton, but Dalton has been hurt the last little bit. There's talk that he might be able to play this weekend. Even if he plays, there'll be questions about his health (#narratives -- again). Anyway, even if he plays, I still give the edge to Pittsburgh (their Elo scores are essentially the same, Pitt's is higher by 10). If Dalton plays, PIT by a FG, if Dalton doesn't play, PIT by a TD. ~~~~ Assuming things go as I've predicted above, that leaves the next 4 games as: GB @ AZ\nSEA @ CAR KC @ NE\nPIT @ DEN On the NFC side, I'm far more confident that one of AZ, SEA, or CAR will reach the Super Bowl (and all three of those teams are strong). In fact, they all have the three highest Elo scores right now! On the AFC side, those two games are wide open! NE has been sliding and Denver \"backed\" into the #1 seed (is that even possible?) Did I mention that both the #5 and #6 seeds in the AFC have beaten the #1 seed in the AFC!? And that NE, after starting the season 10-0, has gone 2-4?

The Panthers have a loss and are not invincible! I'm slightly lowering my conviction for them as the overall favorites (but they are still a great team and Cam Newton is fiercely competitive so I imagine they will come back stronger). The Giants got killed by the Vikings. I rescind my previous comment on them as a potential dark horse. Vikings clinched a spot in the playoffs. I don't see them as contenders for the win but they are attending the playoffs which gives them a greater shot than most. NFC East I will not talk about (with the exception of the Giants above) since nobody there has a shot. The Cardinals look good...really good. I put them very high as contenders.  The Packers got stomped by the Cardinals and the Vikings beat the Giants handily. These 2 are outside contenders but I am placing little weight on both of these teams. Finally, the Falcons handed the Panthers their first loss but I see no shot for them. Panthers remain in the hunt. That leaves 2 serious contenders from the NFC, with the Panthers' chances slightly docked due to loss. 2 outside contenders as well. On to the AFC! Patriots lost to the Jets. That's bad. But they are still contenders despite injuries. The Jets have an outside shot but am not giving them much of  a chance. Broncos remain in the hunt despite 2 losses in a row. I have faith! But without Peyton in his usual form (or playing at all), I am not sure. They play the Bengals tonight so this game will be informative. I'm keeping them as contenders for now. The Chiefs I have not mentioned but they are on a roll. Granted, their schedule hasn't been too tough (it's actually very easy), they definitely show promise. They have beaten the Broncos and won 9 games in a row. They are definitely on my radar but still attributing an outside shot since I am not fully convinced they can get through the likes of the Cardinals or Patriots. Bengals are definitely still contenders and tonight will be interesting. The Steelers were going to be on my radar until they lost to the Ravens (woof). Finally, the AFC South. Everyone sucks. Most of all my own team, the Tennessee Titans. I believe the Texans have their 4th string quarterback in now and JJ Watt is playing with a broken hand. And we got crushed. My apologies for the aside, but it is tough being a Titans fan. Anyways, there are 3 contenders in my view: Patriots, Bengals, Broncos Outside shots in the AFC: Chiefs, Steelers (but not really) NFC contenders: Cardinals, Panthers\noutside shot NFC: Vikings, Packers There are more teams in the running in the AFC which gives more weight, ceteris paribus BUT the Cardinals and Panthers are the best 2 teams in my opinion.

The Cardinals, while serious contenders, seem to me less likely.Following a tight game to the mediocre Vikings and a loss early on vs. the Steelers (not as key to my judgment), I reduce their chances. The Packers are somewhat of a long shot but tend to perform during playoffs. This is very speculative and not founded in reason.

After today's games, the NFC's \"weaker\" teams look like they could give the AFC's \"stronger\" teams a run for their money. In a Seattle (currently the 6-seed) vs. Denver or Cincy (both are currently tied for 1st, along with the Patriots) Superbowl, my money would be on Seattle.

But the cumulative odds equation is too difficult and time consuming for me to attempt currently and I am using a bias and \"guessing\" that it is not much more than a flip of a coin if you compound all of the probabilities and then weight subjectively for current power rankings and the number of variables that can change are just too many even in this short window of time (for instance Tom Brady could get injured or Cam Newton that would vastly affect the probabilistic outcomes).

I think the only team in the AFC that can beat them is the Patriots if Gronk, Amendola and Edelman (miracously) return healthy. However, I don't think they will make it pass the Broncos and the Broncos do not have any decisive advantage over the Panthers. The Panthers have to play three games to win it all (66%/game), if healthy Patriots make it (33%), but I think Broncos will make it so I cut their percentage in half and gave it to the Panthers. The Panthers at this moment, runs a highly efficient run first option offense and has deep ball receivers. Their front seven can handle the run themselves against most teams, which allows the Panthers to keep two deep safeties over the top to protect the deep pass. This is every defensive coordinator's dream scenario. The only team I suspect that can probably force the Panthers to bring an eighth man into the box is the Vikings because of Adrian Peterson. However, the Panthers have a CB in Norman that can lock up their deep threat Stefan Diggs, and possibly shift the free safety over the top of Wallace. Kuechly can cover lots of ground in the mid-deep middle. As for the other NFC teams, I don't think pass heavy teams like the Packers will do well against the Panthers. Seattle will be my dark horse to upset the Panthers because they have speed on their defense, an offense that is similar to the Panthers, and Russell Wilson who can extend plays (nightmare to defensive coordinators), but they have to make the playoffs first. The AFC is a big question mark. The Patriots are by far the best team in the AFC (followed by the Broncos and Bengals), but losing Gronk, Edelman, and Amendola for the next couple of weeks forces them to become a run team. They have to face three great teams against the run (NYJ, Ten, and Hou). These are games where they will have a higher chance of losing, which I have a feeling, Denver or Cincinnati will take home field advantage in the playoffs. Unfortunately, if the Patriots have to play against Denver at home, I think they will lose. The Denver crowd will force Brady to make less adjustments at the line because of crowd noise. Denver plays a lot of man defense and has great pass rushers which is a benefit to the secondary because they don't have to stay in coverage too long. This is a major issue for the pass because Edelman was really the only guy that can get off press coverage quickly. I think the Patriots lose and the Patriots are a much better match up against the Panthers. Hopefully, this much amount of analysis extends over to different questions.

(of the \"elite\" teams in the AFC at this point, that is). A quick scan of the games they've played this season shows that they've only allowed more than 24 points to one opponent -- the Arizona Cardinals, who themselves are a strong contender to win it all. I think we'll have a better idea of the Bengals' mettle when they play Denver on Dec 28th. ~~ In the NFC, Carolina is the cream of the crop and they proved it against a very good QB in T. Romo. Romo certainly has his detractors, but he's proven that he's one of the better QBs in the league over the last decade. Granted, he was just coming off an injury (and fell prey to it again), I was thoroughly impressed with the way Carolina played Defense against him and the rest of the Cowboys.  Maybe it's just me, but it seems that there really aren't any \"superstars\" on Carolina's team. Yes, there's Cam Newton, but my impression is that he's not written about in the same way that Brady is, Brees (was), E. Manning (is), or P. Manning (was). Maybe I'm not following the NFL as closely as I used to, or maybe it's a subtle bit of racism (?), but it seems like the Panthers are more like a \"team\" in that feature player. Further to that, the Panthers' RB is not half bad, either (currently 3rd in the league in rushing) and when it comes time to salt away the game, an important resource to have. The rest of the NFC, to my eyes (and quick glance of the stats), seems more impressive than the Cincy/Denver combination. The Cardinals are really good at putting up points (seven of their eleven games have seen them score more than 30 points). To that end, two of their stars on offense are certainly part of that (C. Palmer, 4th in the league in passing yards, and C. Johnson, 4th in the league in rushing yards). Similarly, Minnesota (and the Adrian Peterson show, who has almost 200 more rushing yards than the person second in the league) is looking pretty good, especially after AP shredded the Falcons' number one run defense. I think we'll learn more about Minny/Arizona when they play each other next Thursday night (Dec. 10). There's also GB, who are perennial contenders, and Seattle's turned things around recently (who would want to face a streaking Seahawks team?) Of course, this will need to be revisited again next Monday, but after this weekend's games, it seems to me that the collection of contenders on the NFC side are pulling away from the collection of contenders on the AFC side. ~~~\n~~~ Here are some other links I was using for the above analysis (pontification?): NFL stats leaders --> http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics\nNFL standings --> http://espn.go.com/nfl/standings\nAdrian Peterson game log --> http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/gamelog/_/id/10452/adrian-peterson\nNFL playoff picture --> http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2015/11/29/9815680/nfl-playoff-picture-2015-panthers-patriots-wild-card-seahawks"], [10449, "2015-11-30T18:47:23Z", [0.75, 0.25], "panthers"], [1029, "2015-11-30T16:41:44Z", [0.35, 0.65], ""], [12202, "2015-11-30T15:39:46Z", [0.15, 0.85], ""], [691, "2015-11-30T13:48:14Z", [0.46, 0.54], ""], [11196, "2015-11-30T13:38:47Z", [0.45, 0.55], "Update: The Patriots' recent injuries might weaken their chances considerably.

Elo Ratings -- http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2015-nfl-predictions/ Also, it would seem that, at least recently, the NFC has been winning more -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_Bowl_champions  Since David Tyree's catch in 08, the NFC has won 5 of 8 Superbowls. The reason I only went back to 08 is because the deeper into recent history we go, the less the teams look like the current iterations. Going back to 08 might even be too far. Even going back to 2010, the NFC's \"winning\" 4 out of the last 6.  However, to that argument, maybe we're in a shift.
