This bodes well for her chances on Super Tuesday.\n- Below are my predictions state by state with delegate counts:\nAlabama (53 Delegates): A demographically similar state to South Carolina, Clinton wins about 75% of the delegates.\nArkansas (32 delegates): The Clintons home state would normally be more favorable to Sanders in this race, but Clinton will take at least 66% of the delegates.\nColorado (66 delegates): The caucus format and more favorable demographics for Sanders make this one interesting. I think Sanders will win by a few percentage points. \nGeorgia (102 delegates): South Carolina's neighbor will follow the trend and issues about 75% of its delegates to Clinton.\nMassachusetts (91 delegates): Another interesting state, polls coming out of MA have long favored Sanders but the most recent favor Clinton. A close race means that they split the delegates roughly in half.\nMinnesota (77 delegates): The caucus format tends to favor Sanders and the State's Democratic party trends more liberal. Sanders should carry about 55 to 60% of the vote, though Clinton may eat into it.\nOklahoma (38 delegates): Polls put this close. I'd say a slight Clinton win by no more than a few percentage points.\nTennessee (67 delegates): Neighboring Arkansas, Alabama and Georgia, Tennessee has been Clinton territory for a long time. 75 to 80% of its delegates will go to her.\nTexas (252 delegates): A racially diverse state, Texas is prime Clinton territory. She'll take 66 to 80% of the delegates here.\nVermont (16 Delegates): Clinton should clean up here.... Just kidding - Sanders will take at least 80% of the vote.\nVirginia (95 delegates): Sanders could potentially do well near the beltway, but he's spent no TV ad money here. The large African-American population and given Clinton's support among moderates mean she'll likely take no less than 55% of the vote. Using the prediction above, I come to the following calcs:\n- Alabama: Clinton - 40; Sanders - 13\n- Arkansas: Clinton - 21; Sanders - 11\n- Colorado: Clinton - 30; Sanders - 36\n- Georgia: Clinton - 77; Sanders - 25\n- Massachusetts: Clinton - 45; Sanders - 45. Extra delegate to winner.\n- Minnesota: Clinton - 30; Sanders - 47.\n- Oklahoma: Clinton - 20; Sanders - 18.\n- Tennessee: Clinton - 50; Sanders - 27.\n- Texas: Clinton - 166; Sanders - 86.\n- Vermont: Clinton - 3; Sanders - 13.\n- Virginia: Clinton - 52; Sanders - 42.

That means that on Super Tuesday, Clinton is likely to win around 508 delegates and Sanders 357.\" Link: http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/south-carolina-primary-results-2016-democrat-clinton-sanders/"], [18132, "2016-02-28T00:22:52Z", [0.9, 0.1], ""], [17394, "2016-02-28T00:14:09Z", [0.51, 0.49], "feeling the Bern but Hillary will unfortunately take it :/"], [17694, "2016-02-28T00:11:14Z", [0.63, 0.37], ""], [17763, "2016-02-28T00:06:01Z", [0.52, 0.48], ""], [30, "2016-02-28T00:05:21Z", [0.97, 0.03], ""], [18342, "2016-02-27T23:40:24Z", [0.55, 0.45], ""], [18230, "2016-02-27T23:37:43Z", [0.55, 0.45], ""], [17956, "2016-02-27T23:22:33Z", [0.55, 0.45], "sam6829"], [18421, "2016-02-27T23:07:13Z", [0.51, 0.49], "I think it will be close but Hillary will win b/c she has the lead in the south."], [18659, "2016-02-27T22:48:23Z", [0.7, 0.3], ""], [17620, "2016-02-27T22:48:02Z", [0.45, 0.55], ""], [17931, "2016-02-27T22:45:19Z", [0.49, 0.51], ""], [17208, "2016-02-27T22:41:54Z", [0.5, 0.5], ""], [14394, "2016-02-27T22:32:40Z", [0.9, 0.1], ""], [534, "2016-02-27T22:28:28Z", [0.99, 0.01], ""], [18553, "2016-02-27T22:20:09Z", [0.7, 0.3], ""], [17829, "2016-02-27T22:16:12Z", [0.5, 0.5], ""], [2965, "2016-02-27T22:12:09Z", [1.0, 0.0], ""], [17416, "2016-02-27T22:09:44Z", [0.55, 0.45], ""], [17588, "2016-02-27T22:05:08Z", [0.45, 0.55], ""], [17072, "2016-02-27T22:03:00Z", [0.8, 0.2], ""], [17083, "2016-02-27T21:55:48Z", [0.48, 0.52], "ut eid : vrj263"], [17541, "2016-02-27T21:54:38Z", [0.45, 0.55], ""], [17259, "2016-02-27T21:51:19Z", [0.51, 0.49], ""], [17201, "2016-02-27T21:45:32Z", [0.49, 0.51], ""], [17190, "2016-02-27T21:42:50Z", [1.0, 0.0], "There aren't enough young voters"], [17571, "2016-02-27T21:37:40Z", [0.55, 0.45], ""], [17251, "2016-02-27T21:21:12Z", [1.0, 0.0], ""], [17207, "2016-02-27T21:12:48Z", [0.51, 0.49], ""], [19758, "2016-02-27T21:03:40Z", [0.4, 0.6], ""], [18296, "2016-02-27T20:49:56Z", [0.56, 0.44], ""], [17302, "2016-02-27T20:42:12Z", [0.65, 0.35], ""], [17895, "2016-02-27T20:33:47Z", [0.85, 0.15], ""], [20698, "2016-02-27T20:24:08Z", [0.75, 0.25], ""], [17480, "2016-02-27T20:20:34Z", [0.45, 0.55], ""], [17480, "2016-02-27T20:20:08Z", [0.55, 0.45], ""], [17399, "2016-02-27T20:16:32Z", [0.4, 0.6], ""], [17463, "2016-02-27T20:10:43Z", [0.55, 0.45], ""], [12879, "2016-02-27T20:01:44Z", [0.6, 0.4], ""], [11885, "2016-02-27T19:56:25Z", [1.0, 0.0], ""], [127, "2016-02-27T19:47:16Z", [0.95, 0.05], ""], [18970, "2016-02-27T19:45:22Z", [0.78, 0.22], ""], [17195, "2016-02-27T19:26:44Z", [0.51, 0.49], ""], [17918, "2016-02-27T19:26:21Z", [0.49, 0.51], ""], [16403, "2016-02-27T19:25:05Z", [0.85, 0.15], ""], [10267, "2016-02-27T19:21:28Z", [1.0, 0.0], ""], [18354, "2016-02-27T19:04:59Z", [0.45, 0.55], ""], [17294, "2016-02-27T19:04:08Z", [0.25, 0.75], ""], [19227, "2016-02-27T19:03:39Z", [0.95, 0.05], ""], [17493, "2016-02-27T18:49:51Z", [0.65, 0.35], ""], [18131, "2016-02-27T18:25:26Z", [0.54, 0.46], ""], [18767, "2016-02-27T18:06:54Z", [0.49, 0.51], ""], [17935, "2016-02-27T17:46:34Z", [1.0, 0.0], ""], [12861, "2016-02-27T17:42:26Z", [0.7, 0.3], ""], [15365, "2016-02-27T17:35:13Z", [0.95, 0.05], ""], [11872, "2016-02-27T17:30:06Z", [0.9, 0.1], ""], [18228, "2016-02-27T17:25:02Z", [0.66, 0.34], ""], [17651, "2016-02-27T17:22:45Z", [0.63, 0.37], ""], [1269, "2016-02-27T17:17:33Z", [0.9, 0.1], ""], [484, "2016-02-27T17:14:22Z", [1.0, 0.0], "(no change) Anyone have any ideas why the consensus for HC dropped almost 35% since 24 Feb?

The Clinton advantage with black voters seems to be their major edge, and yet her crippling optic issues with the black community has only gotten worse: crime bills, super predators, welfare gutting, etc. In contrast, Sanders is soon to release a 2 minute campaign ad including Eric Garners' daughter for major airplay in South Carolina. Hard for me to quantify, hard for me to call insignificant though. Clintons' advantage with minorities seems tenuous at best- and the fairly fast shift in Nevada is indicative of this. A slight win in Nevada not only gives Sanders momentum that not even Obama had, but also shoots at least one of the legs out from the \"white voters only\" argument against Sanders. Sanders scores low for \"visibility\" among minorities, suggesting that he has a lot of room for conversion.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statewide_opinion_polling_for_the_Super_Tuesday_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries,_2008 Finally, an admittedly sloppy look at these polls seems to suggest similar differentials in the 2008 race when we consider the timeline relative to Super Tuesday. There's some noise- from what I can tell, a lot of Edwards voters went over to Obama when he dropped out January 30. But Sanders has two primaries to perform well in to get his name out before Super Tuesday.  I think it's more likely than not that he'll edge HRC out, but her edging him out wouldn't surprise me. I would be surprised if the end narrative was not a close race.

Here for your head-scratching pleasure is something I've taken from Wikipedia. (apologies if I messed anything up) Some comments keyed to the items below that have a number in parenthesis: 1. Basic explanation. 2. Surprise! I thought I had read that this year the pledged delegates are legally obligated to vote for the candidate to whom they are pledged (on the first ballot). 3. The unpledged PLEO delegates seems clear enough 4. A different category of superdelegate 5. The DNC might be another place where Garrison Keillor could plug the benefits of English majors. \"Democratic Party rules distinguish pledged and unpledged delegates. Pledged delegates are selected based on their announced preferences in the contest for the presidential nomination. In the party primary elections and caucuses in each U.S. state, voters express their preference among the contenders for the party's nomination for President of the United States. (1) Pledged delegates supporting each candidate are chosen in approximate ratio to their candidate\u2019s share of the vote.  They fall into three categories: district-level pledged delegates (usually by congressional districts); at-large pledged delegates; and pledged PLEO (Party Leaders and Elected Officials) delegates.  (2) In a minority of the states, delegates are legally required to support the candidate to whom they are pledged.  In addition to the states' requirements, the party rules state (Rule 12.J): \"Delegates elected to the national convention pledged to a presidential candidate shall in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them.\" By contrast, the  (3) unpledged PLEO delegates (Rule 9.A) are seated without regard to their presidential preferences, solely by virtue of being current or former elected officeholders and party officials. Many of them have chosen to announce endorsements, but they are not bound in any way. They may support any candidate they wish, including one who has dropped out of the presidential race. (4) The other superdelegates, the unpledged add-on delegates  (Rule 9.B), who need not be PLEOs, are selected by the state parties after some of the pledged delegates are chosen, but they resemble the unpledged PLEO delegates in being free to vote as they wish. Unpledged PLEO delegates should not be confused with pledged PLEOs. Under Rule 9.C, the pledged PLEO slots are allocated to candidates based on the results of the primaries and caucuses. Another difference between pledged PLEOs and unpledged PLEOs is that there is a fixed number of pledged PLEO slots for each state, while the number of unpledged PLEOs can change during the campaign.  (5) Pledged PLEO delegates are not generally considered superdelegates.\""], [19170, "2016-02-12T00:19:43Z", [0.8, 0.2], ""], [14840, "2016-02-11T23:55:48Z", [1.0, 0.0], ""], [38, "2016-02-11T23:54:29Z", [1.0, 0.0], "Looking at the most recent polls listed in wikipedia for the states in which the Democrat Party delegates will be selected on or before 3/1, I find: State    Clinton    Sanders   Clinton lead   # of delegates\nAL             54%          43%          11%                     53\nAR            57              25             32                        32\nCO            49             36             13                         66\nGA            63             22              41                      102\nMA           52             39              13                        91\nMN           59            25               34                       77\nOK            44            28               16                       38\nTN            50            38               12                       67\nTX             55            34               21                     222\nVT             29            63             (34)                      16\nVA             54            39              15                       95 Right now, Sanders has 5 more delegates (excluding supers) than Clinton.

Currently the candidates are essentially tied in delegates (Hillary @ 32, Bernie @ 36).  In the 15 additional contests that will take place by the end of Super Tuesday on March 1 there are 966 pledged delegates available, of which 307 are in explicitly Southern states (five states) with another 317 in Southern-ish Texas (222) and Virginia (95).   So that's a total of 624 (65%) of the remaining-till-Super-Tuesday delegates in Southern-ish states.  The remaining 35% (342 delegates) are in Nevada, American Samoa, Colorado, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Vermont and Americans abroad.   Hillary is projected to do well in the South, where the Dem electorate is more diverse and her family has political history.  Also, and this is more intangible, but I have a hard time discounting the fact that Southern states seem less likely to vote for someone describing himself as a socialist (democratic or any other variety) than does someone somewhere like Minnesota or living abroad.   Reliable polling is thin for many of these contests right now, but what I am able to find puts Hillary in the neighborhood of 60% support in the Southern-ish states.  Underestimating that slightly, if Hillary gets 55% of the vote it would add 343 delegates from Southern-ish states for a total of 375 to Bernie\u2019s 317.   In the remaining elections, Bernie would need 200 (58.5%) of the remaining delegates to tie.  That is a higher percentage than I am using to estimate Hillary\u2019s support in the Southern-ish states.  While I think Bernie will do better in the non-Southern-ish races, I don\u2019t think those contests will give him enough of a boost to beat Hillary\u2019s strength among the larger Southern-ish delegates.   I\u2019ll revisit this if better polls or aggregations come out (if anyone has those, please share!), or of course if any game changing events happen.   One thing I didn\u2019t account for here is crossover voting in states with open access to vote in either one of the Dem or GOP primaries.  Will try to look at that in the future \u2013 Dem participation rates may fall if some Democrats are happy with either candidate and therefore are more interested in affecting the GOP race, which is more interesting every day.

I agree with Guydreaux (http://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/131770) about where Clinton will do well, but I do not see Sanders winning any states.

Sanders' win in NH was predictable.  It was his photo finish in Iowa that was the surprise.  His  Iowa success was attributable to his intense focus there.  He doesn't have the resources to put forth as comprehensive a campaign in the rest of the states, in spite of having raised $5m just since NH.
