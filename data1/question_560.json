Khalifa Hifter, the military strongman whose forces routed the last Islamist militias from Benghazi in December. After three years of grinding combat, and with the help of foreign allies, General Hifter now controls most of eastern Libya and has become the most powerful if polarizing figure in a fractured landscape. Now, as he aims to consolidate and expand his power, he is looking to woo the Trump administration. . . . \n. . . \nThe nomination of the C.I.A. director Mike Pompeo as secretary of state could further align General Hifter with the United States. Mr. Pompeo, whose confirmation hearing took place Thursday, and Mr. Hifter, a onetime C.I.A. asset, are avowedly hostile to all forms of political Islam. But General Hifter\u2019s ascent has been called into question with news that the 75-year-old commander had been airlifted to a hospital in Paris, where French news media reported that he was being treated for a stroke. After initial denials, his aides privately conceded on Thursday that he had undergone emergency medical treatment. But they offered no specifics about his condition or his whereabouts. The mystery plunged Libya\u2019s chaotic politics into greater-than-usual levels of speculation. If restoring some order to eastern Libya after the fall of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi depended on the force of General Hifter\u2019s personality, there were fears of a descent into violent feuding if he were suddenly out of the picture. \u201cThere was a time last year when Hifter was the man of the hour \u2014 people were speculating he could make it to Tripoli,\u201d said Frederic Wehrey, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the author of \u201cThe Burning Shores: Inside the Battle for the New Libya.\u201d \u201cThen things cooled off a bit, and cracks appeared in his coalition. And now nobody\u2019s sure what will come next.\u201d Amid the competing militias ranging in post-Qaddafi Libya, General Hifter rose to power with the help of foreign firepower and a canny ability to play allies off one another. Warplanes deployed by the United Arab Emirates and Egypt pummeled his enemies and helped him capture oil terminals. French paramilitaries fought on his front lines in Benghazi, where three were killed in 2016. Saudi Arabia provided funding. And to the discomfort of American officials, Russian special forces commandos last year delivered ammunition and intelligence to General Hifter from their bases in western Egypt, a former American intelligence official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss classified information. For much of his life, General Hifter was tied to the United States. In the late 1980s, as a senior Libyan army officer living in exile in Chad, he led a C.I.A.-backed effort to oust Colonel Qaddafi. The plot failed and General Hifter ended up in suburban Virginia, where he lived for two decades, eventually becoming a naturalized American citizen, the former official said. But after he returned to Libya in 2011 with brash ambitions of seizing power, American officials kept him at arms length. Since 2015, American policy has backed the rival United Nations-backed government in Tripoli, a notoriously weak administration, which barely controls a single district of the capital but which remains the main Western hope for a political solution in Libya. The unity government\u2019s prime minister, Fayez Serraj, met with President Trump in the White House in December. In the past year, though, as General Hifter\u2019s troops racked up major victories \u2014 advancing across Benghazi and seizing Libya\u2019s biggest oil terminal \u2014 European leaders started to openly court him. Last summer, he traveled to Paris at the invitation of President Emmanuel Macron, met Italy\u2019s defense minister in Rome, and welcomed the British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, to his fortified hilltop headquarters outside Benghazi. General Hifter presents himself to the West as an unflinching warrior against political Islam in the mold of Egypt\u2019s president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who is a former general. Critics say that approach strengthens his enemies, though, by forcing moderate and extremist Islamist groups together. Although the septuagenarian commander has styled himself as a great military leader, with a fondness for pomp and titles, experts say his true skill is in forging alliances. His Libyan National Army is, in fact, a coalition of militias and regular army units. Since last year he has used those skills to extend his influence into the deserts of southern Libya, a vast and largely lawless area where he has forged a number of tribal alliances, and which in recent years has become the main focus of American counterterrorism efforts. The United States has carried out nine missile strikes in southern Libya, mostly targeting Islamic State militants, since Mr. Trump took office. But even before his recent health problems, Libya experts warned that General Hifter may not have been as strong as he pretended, and that the forces that helped him rise to prominence in the east could also be his undoing. A Shaky Coalition In January, twin car bombings killed 35 people as outside a mosque in eastern Benghazi. Islamist militants were suspected. Hours later, one of General Hifter\u2019s top commanders dragged 10 blindfolded Islamist prisoners onto a street and, as a camera recorded his actions, shot each one in the head with a rifle. The commander, Mahmoud al-Werfalli, was already wanted by the International Criminal Court in The Hague for his alleged role in previous summary executions. But when General Hifter detained Mr. Werfalli, promising to bring him to a military trial, armed supporters burned tires in the streets and shut down major roads. General Hifter was forced to back down. The commander of the Benghazi special forces brigade, Wanis Bukhamada, defused the protests by promising that Mr. Werfalli would not be sent to the international court. \u201cThis is a matter for the Libyan courts,\u201d he said. Libyan courts, such as they are, have yet to take up the case. That was the second challenge to General Hifter\u2019s authority. In November, a tribal commander, Faraj Gaaim, was detained after he demanded on television that General Hifter step down. Tribal opponents grumble that General Hifter\u2019s army is dominated by his Furjan clan, and that his sons act as his enforcers. For Benghazi residents, the complaint is that the religious militants who helped him seize Benghazi are now exerting a disproportionate influence on daily life in the city. In the past year hard-line preachers have taken over many mosques, and conservative officials have shut down music concerts and tried to stop women from traveling while unaccompanied. \u201cIt\u2019s like a bargain with the devil,\u201d said Naseim Omeish, 25, a development official. \u201cThey get control of the mosques so they can consolidate their power. But that can go wrong.\u201d Western efforts to bring General Hifter to the negotiating table have come to naught. In Paris last summer, he signed an agreement with Tripoli to hold elections by the end of 2018, but that now seems a distant possibility. In interviews, General Hifter has shown little enthusiasm for a free vote. \u201cToday\u2019s Libya is not ripe for democracy,\u201d he told the French magazine Jeune Afrique last month. \u201cPerhaps future generations will succeed.\u201d Many critics, especially in western Libya, see that as further proof that he is little more than a reconstituted version of Colonel Qaddafi, relishing power for power\u2019s sake and riding roughshod over basic freedoms and human rights. A United Nations report published this week highlighted torture, arbitrary detention and other abuses at jails run by General Hifter, as well as at those run by rival militias in the west. Supporters say that, after seven years of chaos, a Qaddafi- or Sisi-style strongman may be exactly what Libya needs. \u201cBelieve me, I lost my faith in elections,\u201d said Amal Bugaighis, a lawyer and civil society activist in Benghazi. \u201cMaybe in five or ten years time. But for now we need someone strong in charge.\u201d In recent months, General Hifter participated in talks with military officials from western Libya, mediated by Egypt, over proposals to forge a united national army. But that is now on hold, as all eyes in Libya turn to the French hospital where he is undergoing treatment. A wild range of rumors circulated in Libya on Thursday, ranging from accounts that he was recovering well from his treatment, to those suggesting he had in fact died. His spokesman said in a tweet on Wednesday that \u201call the news\u201d about General Hifter\u2019s health was false. \u201cMarshal Hifter is in excellent health, and he is following his daily general command duties,\u201d the spokesman said. Were General Hifter to become incapacitated, one strong possibility is that the coalition that he so carefully assembled to take control of Benghazi would come apart at the seams, riven by strains and lacking a natural successor, said Mr. Wehrey, the analyst. \u201cFor all Hifter\u2019s faults, he was the glue binding it all together,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no comparable figure to fill his shoes.\u201d\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  My take-away from this article is:  Were General Hifter to become incapacitated, one strong possibility is that the coalition that he so carefully assembled to take control of Benghazi would come apart at the seams, riven by strains and lacking a natural successor, . . . \n\u201cFor all Hifter\u2019s faults, he was the glue binding it all together,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no comparable figure to fill his shoes.\u201d If Gen Hifter becomes incapacitated the re-opening of any embassies will probably be delayed.\n"], [83, "2018-04-14T04:30:05Z", [0.99, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [368, "2018-04-13T21:39:05Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [41318, "2018-04-13T21:28:16Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [47482, "2018-04-13T16:53:10Z", [0.87, 0.09, 0.03, 0.01], "Ken_Barns convinced me I need to take a stronger stand on 0% than I was previously.

Presumably the resolution date/time is the same as the question's closing date/time.   \u201cEU countries\u201d:\nThe 28 states found here:https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/countries_en.  It does not include the 6 (or 7, depending on how you count Kosovo) \u201ccandidate states\u201d, nor the 4 EFTA states that are Schengen signatories, nor any European microstates.  As mentioned in the question, it DOES include an embassy sent by the EU as a whole. Of these states (including the EU), 18 have had an embassy in Libya up until 2014. \u201cAnnounce\u201d: \nAn official press release by the state intending to open an embassy.  The announcement might not have to have a set date for the opening (but would include a timeframe), or the set date might be after 1 June, but the announcement itself must be made before 1 June.  So I suspect that an announcement such as \u201cSyldavia will be reopening its embassy in Tripoli within the next two months\u201d would count, but \u201cSyldavia intends to reopen its embassy in Tripoli as soon as possible\u201d would not.  Of course, wildly optimistic statements by Libyan \u201csecurity officials\u201d (eg: http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-10/19/c_136690056.htm) do not count. \u201cOpening\u201d\nNewly-opening by a nation like Latvia, which had never had an embassy in Libya, but more likely, re-opening an embassy that was closed in 2014. \u201cAn embassy\u201d\nNot an office for embassy staff (eg. Netherlands in October 2017), not an ambassador, but a full-service embassy, referred to as such by the sending state. \u201cIn Libya\u201d\nThe embassy must be a resident mission. REFERENCE CLASSES\nIt is difficult to find suitable cases to compare to \u201cfailed states\u201d like present day Libya.  Embassies in Lebanon appear to have closed for only short periods, with no full evacuation of diplomatic missions despite bombings.  Kabul and Baghdad had many embassies reopen after (or even before) the installation of a provisional government \u2026 and well before elections were called.  Mogadishu has really only seen the British embassy reopen (of Western governments) since 1991, though the US came close in 2015.  I suspect that Somalia is the best reference point here. Why? In a situation with competing governments, the establishment of an embassy requires presenting credentials to a host government.  In Somalia, as in Libya, it is not clear that the \u201cofficially recognised government\u201d is the main power in the state. Another point to note is that, in general, if one state feels that it has become appropriate to reopen an embassy, many other nations are likely to reopen in a similar time frame.  Leaving Italy's embassy reopening 12mth ago to one side (given Italy's specific concerns about migration via Libya), would the opening a single embassy \u2013 say, the Netherlands \u2013 presage a number of EU nations reopening embassies (eg. Kabul in 2001/2, or Baghdad in 2003/4), or not (eg. UK embassy in Mogadishu in 2013)? INSIDE VIEW\nIt appears that a prerequisite to triggering a high probability of EU nations embassies reopening is the emergence a single credible national government, whether elected or transitional.  In either case, this will require either re-negotiation of the Libyan Political Agreement (LPA), or else the holding of legitimate elections.  Either of these eventualities will require a significant rapprochement between the competing HoR/LNA and GNA factions. It is appropriate to review media that monitor the relationship between those two factions.  SUBQUESTIONS\nSpreadsheet time!  Factors feeding into my model: a)  What is the probability of a significant rapprochement between the HoR/LNA and GNA before 1 May?\nb)  If no rapprochement, what is the probability that the security situation in Libya (and Tripoli specifically) improving from its current status?\nc)  If no rapprochement, what is the probability that the security situation will significantly deteriorate?\nd)  For each eventuality (rapprochement, steady improvement, status quo, deterioration), what is the probability of each of the 4 outcome buckets? Forecast as above. Largest outcome combinations:\nStatus quo \u2192 0 embassies = 0.29\nDeterioration \u2192 0 embassies = 0.17\nStatus quo \u2192 1-2 embassies = 0.17\nSteady improvement \u2192 1-2 embassies = 0.12\nSteady improvement \u2192 0 embassies = 0.12 [For those followers, the model is similar to the one I used in the Zambia question.

Libya was a key investor to Cyprus after the invasion of the island by Turkey and was a source of jobs for Cypriots working under the Cypriot multinational company Joannou & Paraskevaides. The latest state visit between the two countries was of Cypriot Foreign Minister Erato Kozakou-Marcoullis to Tripoli in 2011 after the overthrow of the Gaddafi regime. \u00a0Czech Republic  The Czech Republic was relatively slow, among European Union member states, to establish full diplomatic relations with the NTC. Meetings between Czech and Libyan officials of the NTC began in mid-June 2011, and by the end of the month, Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg was quoted as saying, while visiting Benghazi to deliver a shipment of medical supplies, that the Czech Republic recognised the NTC as the legitimate representative of the Libyan people. However, Schwarzenberg later clarified that he had not expressed his government's recognition of the NTC as a legitimate government, a position he maintained until the end of the Battle of Tripoli.  On 21 September 2011, the Czech Republic joined the Friends of Libya Conference, a group of countries and international organisations committed to helping rebuild a democratic, internationalist Libya. \u00a0France - France was the first country to recognise the NTC as Libya's sole legitimate representative, doing so on 10 March 2011. Just over a week later, France co-sponsored United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973, and the French Air Force was the first military coalition component to engage Gaddafi-loyal forces on the ground in Libya, intervening to turn the tide at the Second Battle of Benghazi on 19 March by destroying advancing columns of Libyan Army tanks, armoured personnel carriers, and artillery pieces. In late August 2011, France unblocked 20 percent of frozen Libyan assets held in the country. President Nicolas Sarkozy visited Tripoli on 15 September, becoming (together with British Prime Minister David Cameron) one of the first world leaders to make a state visit to Libya since the conquest of the capital. \u00a0Germany - \u00a0Greece - Hungary - \u00a0Italy - As Italy was a relatively strong supporter of Muammar Gaddafi prior to the 2011 civil war, as well as Libya's largest international trade partner, Rome's decision to reject Gaddafi as a negotiating party and recognise the NTC in early April 2011 was seen as a major diplomatic coup for NTC envoy Mahmoud Jibril. Although Italy joined international military efforts to weaken Gaddafi's grip on the country, granting the use of military bases in Italian territory and participating in Operation Unified Protector, Foreign Minister Franco Frattini called for an \"immediate cessation of hostilities\" in June 2011 to allow for the delivery of humanitarian aid, a suggestion that NATO ignored. In late August 2011, Frattini vowed that Italian oil company Eni would \"play a number one role in the future\" in Libya and resume oil production as soon as Libya's oilfields reopened for business.[68] Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi also announced the release of $505 million in frozen Libyan assets as a \"first payment\" to Libya's new government as its forces battled to secure Tripoli. Abdulrahman Ben Yezza, a former Eni executive, was named oil minister in the caretaker government of Prime Minister Abdurrahim El-Keib on 22 November. \u00a0Malta - On 21 February 2011, days before the establishment of the NTC in Benghazi, two Libyan Air Force fighter jets defected to Malta rather than bomb the restive eastern cities. The Maltese government's refusal to extradite the pilots or return the aircraft to Libya swiftly established the island state as an unfriendly neighbour of the Gaddafi government amidst the Libyan uprising. After the fall of Tripoli to anti-Gaddafi forces in late August 2011, Maltese Foreign Affairs Minister Tonio Borg announced on 10 September that Malta would become the first EU country to reopen its embassy in the Libyan capital. The following day, Libyan Finance Minister Ali Tarhouni commissioned an investigation into companies with joint Libyan and Maltese shareholding, with the intent of locating businessmen both in Libya and in Malta who had assisted the Gaddafi government during the war, such as by facilitating the importation of oil to Gaddafi-loyal ports in defiance of the UN embargo. A spokesman for Tarhouni's office said that \"all honest businessmen have no need to worry\" and indicated the probe was not a critique of the Maltese government. \u00a0Netherlands \u00a0Poland  -  Poland at the mid 2000s like the rest of West countries started to turn its eyes back on Libya after almost 20 years of absence. At the beginning of the civil war, the Polish government was not eager to participate in any military action in Libya, but called the other members of NATO and European Union to use other ways, but prime minister Donald Tusk assured that Poland would take part in some \"community activities.\" At the same time, Polish NGOs started the preparations to help eastern Libya. The position of government concern Libya has not changed with the beginning of Military intervention in Libya.  The diplomatic relations with NTC were established during the visit of Polish FM Rados\u0142aw Sikorski to Benghazi on 11 May, when he announced the recognition of the NTC as \"rightful interlocutor for the international community (...) in Libya\" Poland was the only country that opened its embassy in Benghazi. On 8 July, the Minister noticed the Polish recognition of NTC as the \"legitimate government of the Libyan people\". Poland was also member of Libya Contact Group, where it offered to launch an humanitarian help and trainings for state officials and new law and order services. There are unofficial reports that Poland was sending weapons and officers of Polish Special Forces. Ahmed El-Mallul, a Libyan surgeon in Poland, was a mediator between the NTC and the Polish government. On 15 September Poland reopened its embassy in Tripoli and started to prepare ground for humanitarian help, which arrived on 3 October in Misrata. Also Libyan representatives were in Poland at the parliamentary elections on 6\u201311 October 2011. Next visit of foreign minister took place on 24 October in Tripoli. Three days later Libyan decedents decided to strengthen bilateral relations and notify Polish MFA about upgrading its Economic Cooperation Bureau in Warsaw to the rank of Embassy and establish a joint Libyan-Polish commission headed by its Ministers of Foreign Affairs. \u00a0Portugal -  Romania - \u00a0Serbia -  Spain \u00a0United Kingdom - The United Kingdom co-sponsored UNSCR 1973 and was one of the largest contributors to Operation Unified Protector, the NATO-led intervention to degrade the military strength of Muammar Gaddafi's forces, though it carried out considerably fewer strike missions than fellow coalition partners France and the United States. In early September 2011, the Royal Air Force flew crateloads of unfrozen Libyan funds in the form of dinar banknotes to Benghazi, the location of the NTC's interim central bank. On 15 September, Prime Minister David Cameron visited Tripoli together with French President Sarkozy to meet with leaders of the NTC. *** Countries with Missions in Benghazi:  Bulgaria (Consulate-General) - Germany (liaison office) - Italy (Consulate-General) - Malta (liaison office) - United Kingdom (liaison office) - European Union (liaison office)\n____________________________________\nCOMMENTS:  However, the situation in Libia is far from calm:\nHeavily armed Libyan militias clashed in Tripoli on Monday, killing at least 20 people and forcing the capital's only airport to close, officials said.

If nothing else, it confirms that no other European countries have re-opened anything despite rumors and general reports of \"resuming diplomatic relations\" through agents without actually re-opening the embassy.\nhttps://www.libyaherald.com/2018/01/09/a-year-on-from-italy-reopening-its-embassy-in-tripoli-an-interview-with-italian-ambassador-giuseppe-perrone/\nAnd also for this awkward question and response over the disputed issue of Italy's MOU with the Libyan gov as really paying off militias who traffick laborers, which just goes to show why other European countries would prefer to have Italy going it alone in Libya to deal with immigration concerns:\nLH \u2013Talking of illegal immigration, Italy has been accused in some quarters of financing militias, not only through deals but also through payments.  Why?\nAmbassador Perrone: \u201cWe don\u2019t finance militias\u2026\u201d. The second is this not-terribly-surprising rumor from Xinhua.net reporting that Libya plans to significantly increase the number of security personnel for foreign embassies (not a great sign, over all, since it indicates reasons not to return & reopen your embassy) and the assurances of the Libyan diplomatic security service that \"a number\" of European embassies will reopen in Libya this year.  This seems more of the same from last fall - a big PR push to encourage European embassies to return in the hopes that this will encourage businesses & others to feel things are more stable/reliable, some interest to see if it's true and might be beneficial for business or diplomatic purposes from others, but not a lot from anyone outside of Libya confirming anything at all.  \nhttp://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-01/02/c_136865399.htm I still think there is a reason for European countries to consider re-opening embassies, though they are largely related to managing immigration issues into Europe, most obviously through Italy who has already re-opened their embassy.  But the financial issues and competing political issues make it unlikely to happen in a hurry.

South Korea will probably remain in Tunis for now, but business value there may mean they return also. Even if Hungary doesn't re-open in Jan, seems there's still a good chance it will happen before August.  Probably bigger news if Britain, France or Germany returns than for Hungary.

The first is the straight forward question of it being safe for the diplomats, the second is does any authority exist in the specific location where the embassy is, that can be considered to be the legitimate and de facto government of Libya. \nLegally an embassy is to some specific authority. It seems to me that in practice it is not clear what the authority in Libya is - The GNA is recognised as the authority and they do more or less control Tripoli, but not securely and the GNA does not control the majority of the country.  Because Libya is a divided country most problems that diplomats are trying to address require negotiations with and between different factions that control different areas of the country and do not trust each other, and therefore need to take place on neutral ground, which means somewhere outside Libya. Therefore although Libya has a lot of problems that foreign governments would like solved, it is not immediately obvious that this can be done better by an embassy within Libya than one in Tunis.   \nHaving said that, Italy re-opened its embassy in Tripoli some months ago.  It is reported that France has irritated Italy by hosting talks between the two rival Libyan governments, but France has suggested that Italy had been wrong to back a Misrata based militia. I would suggest that having an embassy within Libya, which means working with who ever controls the territory in which you are based, creates an obvious impression that your country supports one faction over the others, which may not be helpful. \nTherefore I suggest that most western countries might see getting agreement for a single Libyan government needs to come before re-opening embassies. However if one moves they will probably all move.
