Although Beto O'Rourke is wildly popular and a fan favorite of sorts, I do not believe he has the support in Texas to out Senator Cruz. This is interesting considering the fact that Beto O'Rourke has raised more many than any other midterm candidate. Additionally, he has made a campaign stop in every single Texas county - all 254.  That being said, it still does not appear that Beto O'Rourke will beat Senator Cruz. Cruz has never once lost his lead in the polls, in fact, he is consistently at least 6 points ahead of Beto O'Rourke. Senator Cruz has a consistent support amongst Texas voters, and it seems he will be able to retain his seat.  https://www.axios.com/midterm-candidate-fundraising-e606786d-35f8-4b29-9c5b-6ce88ab2caed.html\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/05/us/politics/midterm-elections-update.html\nhttps://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2018/senate/tx/texas_senate_cruz_vs_orourke-6310.html\n"], [47812, "2018-11-05T18:23:23Z", [0.18, 0.82, 0.0], ""], [14253, "2018-11-05T13:47:32Z", [0.93, 0.07, 0.0], ""], [35831, "2018-11-05T13:09:32Z", [0.9, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [31201, "2018-11-05T03:26:03Z", [0.25, 0.75, 0.0], "Who knows, but early turnout suggests predictions of likely voter sample not very accurate so could well have 5% error.

If he is not confirmed, chances are the President will nominate someone even more conservative, which will threaten Roe V.

Second, Cruz is relying heavily on Trump support to get him across the finish line despite the president becoming more and more unpopular. It remains to be seen how much of an asset Trump can be in a state that is turning purple. Finally, O'Rourke is running a campaign similar to Bernie Sanders in 2016 in that it is built on authenticity and statement of views that are genuine and not poll tested.
