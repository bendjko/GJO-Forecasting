Interior Secretary James Watt, in the Reagan administration, decided to open up the west for mining, logging, and drilling.

James Watt was called \"the Fort Knox of environmental fundraising.\"  My sense is that this pipeline effort is an overreach in an administration that has set itself up for many other fights.  Don't forget that many Albertans are against tar sands development too because of ecological damage and substantial greenhouse gas emissions. Now look at this economically, it is very costly to derive petroleum from tar sands.  The reasons they weren't developed decades ago was because the price of oil was too low.  Looking ahead to 2018, the price of oil is forecast to be stable, even flat.  The marginal economic returns may not be worth the fight either.

There are 3 federal agencies that have responsibilities for NEPA. The primary responsibility is held by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) - a division of the Executive Office of the President.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reviews EIS\u2019s issued by federal agencies - in this case it will review the EIS the Corps of Engineers submits. The 3rd agency is the US Institute for Environmental Conflict and Resolution - this is a neutral party that attempts to solve disputes between agencies.  The EPA is crucial in other agencies NEPA processes as it is responsible for reviewing and commenting on the adequacy of analysis and the impact to the environment. Also has a system that summarises its recommendations to the lead agency (in the case of DAPL: US Army Corps of Engineers). EPA can decide if the action the lead agency has taken is environmental un/satisfactory. President Trump\u2019s nominee to head the EPA is Attorney General Scott Pruitt has spent much of his career suing the EPA to roll back protection of the nations air and water (nytimes.com) and is also sponsored by fossil fuel companies. His confirmation vote is expected soon.  When the EPA determines the action is environmentally unsatisfactory, it is referred to the CEQ. Since President Trump\u2019s inauguration, there is no longer a CEQ website nor has there been any mention of a new chair of the CEQ (CEQ chairmans are appointed by the President and confirmed by the senate).  Having Pruitt as the possible head of EPA, no mention yet of a new chair of the CEQ and the nominee for Energy Secretary Rick Perry (who wanted to scrap the department of energy (guardian.com)) - this EIS could eventually be determined as irrelevant under new legislation or rushed through.

NWP refers to the Nationwide Permit which is a general permit that authorizes \"the construction, maintenance, repair, and removal\" of pipelines throughout the nation, where the activity will affect no more than a half-acre of regulated waters at any single water crossing.  A general permit tends to streamline the planning and construction process.  However, actions under the general permit must also comply with General Conditions.   The GCs may require that a particular covered action be subject to a PCN before work begins.  A PCN is a pre-construction notice and verification.  Of particular relevance is GC 20 which mandates a PCN for any permitted activity that \"may have the potential to cause effects to any historic properties...including previously unidentified properties\" of cultural or religious importance to the tribe.  I would contend that the concept of sacredness is largely foreign to many people who are not steeped in tribal tradition and culture.  In that sense, it is too easy to dismiss as unimportant.
