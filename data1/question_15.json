They will be the first U.N.-mediated negotiations on Syria in almost a year, during which time the military and geopolitical context has changed massively. Even so, the same disagreements are likely to resurface. De Mistura said Russia, which has supported President Bashar al-Assad's military advances, had asked the Syrian government to \"silence their own skies in the areas touched by the ceasefire\" during the talks. Countries close to the opposition were also asked to urge them to lessen provocations, he said. \"Am I expecting a breakthrough? No, I'm not expecting a breakthrough,\" de Mistura told a news conference. \"But I am expecting and determined for keeping a very pro-active momentum,\" he said. Hours later, the Syrian opposition called for face-to-face negotiations with the government delegation, saying it was hoping for a \"serious partner\" while casting doubt on Damascus' readiness. Spokesman Salem al-Muslet, speaking to reporters, said the opposition delegation did not want this round to be like the one a year ago that was fruitless. Referring to the delegation led by Syrian Ambassador to the U.N. in New York Bashar al-Ja'afari, he said: \"We have experience with this regime. They're not here to negotiate about a political transition, but they're here to buy time and commit more crimes in Syria. There's no trust in this regime.\" De Mistura said he hoped neither side would seek to disrupt the talks by provoking the other and that momentum towards a political solution was necessary to thwart \"spoilers\" bent on derailing peace efforts (para. 1-8).

Rebel officials said that no official explanation had been given for the move this month following the jihadist assault, though several said they believed the main objective was to prevent arms and cash falling into Islamist militant hands. But they said they expected the aid freeze to be temporary. The halt in assistance, which has included salaries, training, ammunition and in some cases guided anti-tank missiles, is a response to jihadist attacks and has nothing to do with U.S. President Donald Trump replacing Barack Obama in January, two U.S. officials familiar with the CIA-led program said. The freeze reflects the troubles facing Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebels in the almost six-year-old revolt against Assad, who now appears militarily unassailable in his core western region largely thanks to direct intervention on his side by Russia and Iran. \"The reality is that you have changes in the area, and these changes inevitably have repercussions,\" said an official with one of the affected FSA rebel groups. He said no military assistance could \"enter at present until matters are organized. There is a new arrangement but nothing has crystallized yet\". The support funneled to vetted FSA factions has included contributions from Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia - states that have opposed Assad. It is one of several foreign aid channels to rebels. Others still function. The CIA declined comment on the reported freeze in support. A Qatari official said his government had nothing to say on the matter. Turkish officials said only they could not discuss \"operational details\". There was no word from Saudi Arabia. Reuters confirmed the freeze with officials from five of the FSA groups that have been recipients of financial and military support from the so-called \"MOM operations room\". It was also confirmed by two other senior FSA figures briefed on the matter. They spoke on condition of anonymity given the covert nature of the CIA-backed program and the sensitivity of the subject.\nSeveral rebels believed the aid halt was temporary, with new arrangements expected, but there was no clarity yet. Confirming the freeze, two senior FSA sources said donor states were aiming to send the aid to one, unified fighting force - a coherence that has eluded rebels throughout Syria's civil war.

In Syria, the Shiite militia honed its capabilities in battle against various other nonstate actors, including the Islamic State. Hezbollah has perhaps been partly motivated to join the fray in Syria to counter the entrenched influence of Salafi-jihadist groups across the region, as well as their growing popularity within Lebanon. Indeed, pivoting from the group\u2019s stated raison d\u2019etre\u2014countering Israel\u2014Nasrallah has identified fighting the Islamic State as one of the chief reasons for Hezbollah\u2019s involvement in Syria.\nHezbollah will also benefit from the enlarged alliance with Syria and Iran to one that now includes Russia (the Iran-Syria-Hezbollah nexus has been referred to as \u201cthe Shiite Axis\u201d). Indeed, U.S. officials have verified reports that Hezbollah militants have been working on the ground in tandem with not only Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force commanders, but also with Russian special-operations troops, which is a harrowing development.

The Syrian rebels and government came together for the first time in 9 months, and agreement was reached to consolidate a shaky ceasefire.\nBut by the second round this week, things had gone downhill. The Syrian rebels debated until the eleventh hour about whether to attend at all, finally sending a smaller delegation which arrived in the Kazakh capital a day late.\nRussia's efforts were hampered by the deep enmity between the rival Syrian sides, but also by contradictions among its co-sponsors. One of them, Turkey, is fiercely opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Russia and the third co-sponsor, Iran, are Assad's staunchest allies.\nSyrian government negotiator Bashar Jaafari said on Thursday that peace talks in Astana had not produced a communique because of the \"irresponsible\" late arrival of rebel participants and their Turkish backers which delayed the joint session by a day.\nHe also criticized the rebels and Turkey for downgrading their delegations from the previous meeting.\n\"Turkey cannot ignite the fire and at the same time act as a firefighter,\" he told a briefing after the talks (para 1-11).

Iran is finding that asymmetric capabilities designed to deter the U.S. or Israel are insufficient to conduct the more conventional military operations required in Syria and elsewhere. The Iranian military is overcoming significant institutional obstacles to meet these new requirements. The campaign for Aleppo reflects Iran\u2019s success in applying this new approach to waging war. Iranian ground troops boosted the capabilities of Iranian-backed proxies and enabled pro-regime forces to seize and hold key terrain from opposition forces.

They don't need safe zones at all.\" \n\"It's much more viable, much more practical and less costly to have stability than to create safe zones.\" \nAssad said safe zones would be at risk of attack from armed groups. \nThe United Nations also rejects safe zones, saying conditions in Syria, where battles rage on between multiple sides, are not suitable (para. 1-9).

An official in a military alliance fighting in support of the Syrian government confirmed a clash had taken place. \"The Russians intervened to control the situation,\" said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity. \nPresident Bashar al-Assad is supported in the war by the Russian military and an array of Iranian-backed militias. \nTwo rebel officials accused the government forces of provoking the incident. One of them said the government forces had moved towards their positions in tanks. \"Rebels shot to warn them not to get any closer, but the tank responded and a clash erupted,\" said the first rebel official. \n\"Later on Russia intervened to calm down the situation,\" said the rebel official. \"This whole incident felt like a test.\"(para.1-7)/ Bassam, L.& Pamuk, H.

Azizi wrote, \u201cThe primary Iranian concern in this regard is Ankara\u2019s alleged links to Jabhat Fatah al-Sham [formerly Jabhat al-Nusra] and its apparent support of Ahrar al-Sham, another militant Salafi group. As was clear in both the Moscow Declaration and the Russia-Turkey cease-fire deal, Jabhat Fatah al-Sham and its affiliates are excluded from the cessation of hostilities while Ahrar al-Sham\u2019s declared rejection of the accord effectively makes it a legitimate target. Hence, in practical terms, Ankara appears to have accepted what Iran has long been insisting on.\u201d\nAzizi added, \u201cTurkey has made other important concessions, given its adherence to two important Iranian red lines. These include Turkey\u2019s refraining from insisting on [Syrian President Bashar al-] Assad\u2019s removal as a precondition for peace talks and also Turkey's refraining from demanding that certain Iran-backed groups, particularly Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah movement, be listed as groups not allowed to be present in Syria. There was no formal reference to Hezbollah in the Moscow Declaration or the Dec. 31 Security Council resolution. Moreover, members of Assad\u2019s government will take part in the upcoming talks in Kazakhstan.\u201d\nFinally, Aziz noted that \u201calthough Iran still has concerns regarding Turkey's operation in northern Syria, it appears that as long as the operation is limited to fighting the Islamic State and also the Kurds in the area and does not include some new areas \u2014 particularly Raqqa \u2014 Iran could tolerate it. This is because Tehran and Ankara have a shared interest in preventing more Kurdish autonomy in the region, since it could potentially ignite sentiments among Kurdish communities within their own borders.\u201d \"Gurcan explained that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s priorities in Syria have tilted Ankara away from Washington and toward Moscow. \u201cAnkara\u2019s main political agenda in the first months of 2017 will be the highly contentious matter of Syria's leadership transition. Any success or failure in foreign policy issues will be used for domestic consumption \u2014 Erdogan will now have two ideal scapegoats in case things do not go well at al-Bab: the United States and NATO. Erdogan will easily market a narrative of, \u2018The United States has spoiled our goals at al-Bab,\u2019 in case of a failure. That will allow him a gracious escape from domestic pressures.\u201d\nIn contrast to Iran and Turkey, Saudi Arabia has been on the sidelines of the latest diplomatic blitz in Syria. Azizi concluded, \u201cIn contrast [to Turkey], if Saudi Arabia, for instance, was part of the nascent peace process, the reaching of an understanding could be almost impossible due to the severe ideological confrontation between Tehran and Riyadh. As such, seemingly aware of the latter, Russia appears to have for now limited the Syrian stage to just Iran and Turkey.\u201d Al-Jazeera, January 6, 'Russia 'scaling down' military presence in Syria': http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/01/russia-scales-military-presence-syria-170106094404964.html\nClips from Al-Jazeera article:\n\"The tasks set for the aircraft carrier group during its military mission have been fulfilled,\" said Andrei Kartapolov, Russia's main commander in Syria.\nKartapolov said Russia still had sufficient air defence capabilities in Syria thanks to its S-300 and S-400 systems deployed in the war-torn country.\" Defense News, January 6, 'Israeli Satellite Imagery Shows Russian Nuclear-Capable Missiles in Syria': http://www.defensenews.com/articles/israeli-satellite-imagary-shows-russian-nuclear-capable-missiles-in-syria\nClips from Defense article:\n\"Captured on Dec 28 by the Israeli-built Eros B satellite, the spy-quality images were posted Jan. 5 on the website of ImageSat International (iSi), a subsidiary of Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), the state-owned firm that builds all of Israel\u2019s spy satellites. \nIn a section of the iSi website called Insights, the firm shows an image over Russia\u2019s Hmeymin base in Latakia, Syria of what it says are two Iskander-launching vehicles, each capable of deploying two of the 500-kilometer-range surface-to-surface missiles known to NATO as SS-26.\"  Comments:\nIntermediate Russian goals realized: Assad regime stabilized; regional RU interests/influence protected and strengthened, combat losses/financial commitment limited, detente with TR, strategic win over USA.

[This deal is], subject to change and would need the buy-in of Assad and the rebels and, eventually, the Gulf states and the United States . . .  \u201cA final deal will be hard, but stances have shifted.\u201d  . . . Assad\u2019s powers would be cut . . . Russia and Turkey would allow him to stay until the next presidential election, when he would quit in favour of a less polarising Alawite candidate.  Iran has yet to be persuaded . . . . But . . .  Assad would eventually go, in a face-saving way, with guarantees for him and his family. \". . .  What is clear is that President Vladimir Putin wants to play the lead role in trying to broker a settlement, initially with Turkey and Iran. . . . If Russia gets its way, new peace talks between the Syrian government and the opposition will begin in mid-January in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan, a close Russian ally.\nThe talks would be distinct from intermittent UN-brokered negotiations and not initially involve the United States. . . . Foreign and defence ministers from Russia, Turkey and Iran met in Moscow on December 20 and set out the principles they thought any Syria deal should adhere to. \"Russian sources say the first step is to get a nationwide ceasefire and then to get talks underway. The idea would then be to get Gulf states involved, then the United States, and at a later stage the European Union which would be asked, maybe with the Gulf states, to pick up the bill for rebuilding.\n. . . \n\"Putin has struck a series of backroom understandings with . . . Erdogan to ease the path to a possible deal . . .  Moscow got Iran to buy into the idea of a three-way peace push by getting Turkey to drop its demands for Assad to go soon. . .  \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean we approve of Assad.

Britain\u2019s former ambassador, said Moscow and Ankara had done a deal because Moscow had needed Turkey to get the opposition out of Aleppo and to come to the negotiating table. . . . \n. . . \n\" . . . Russia does not want to get bogged down in a long war and wants to hold Syria together and keep it as an ally. Turkey wants to informally control a swathe of northern Syria giving it a safe zone to house refugees, a base for the anti-Assad opposition, and a bulwark against Kurdish influence. . . . Erdogan is determined that Turkish-backed rebels capture the city [Al Bab, an Daesh-held city around 40 km northeast of Aleppo] to prevent Kurdish militias from doing so. Several sources said there had been an understanding between Ankara and Moscow that rebels could leave Aleppo to help take Al Bab. \"Iran\u2019s interests are harder to discern . . .

While formally they are just part of the larger Russian special forces community, they have a unique history and unique reputation.  Traditionally, Russia has always relied on elite Muslim shock forces, and most of those have been Chechen.  This was true before the 1917 Revolution as it was true after.  For example, the so-called \u201cMuslim battalion\u201d played a key role in the invasion of Afghanistan.  And 2008, the Chechen battalions \u201cWest\u201d and \u201cEast\u201d played a key role in the Russian counter-offensive against the Georgian forces.  To make a long story short: not only are these battalions known for their amazing courage and skills, their appearance often sends the opposing forces into a panic. Second, Ramzan Kadyrov has been pouring huge resources, with the full support of Putin, of course, into the creation of a unique special forces training facility Chechnia were special operators from all over Russia are coming to learn, teach and share their experience.  As a result, the so-called \u201cChechen\u201d units are, in reality, a mix of special operators from all over Russia who have been specially trained to deal with Daesh-like insurgencies.\nRetrieved from here: http://thesaker.is/putin-sends-chechen-special-operation-forces-to-syria/"], [368, "2016-12-28T21:30:28Z", [0.0], ""], [1262, "2016-12-28T18:57:24Z", [0.0], "agree with @Isgold7    (http://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/409761)    "], [2965, "2016-12-28T15:31:41Z", [0.0], "http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN14H0WE?il=0\nSee my Raqqa forecast today.

While pro-government forces were moving in, United Nations officials said they were receiving multiple reports of execution-style killings.\nThe deal was announced just as civilians inside the rebel enclave said they had lost hope. They had spent days huddled in abandoned apartments under heavy shelling, as those with a record of opposing the government said they were bracing for arrest, conscription or death (para. 1-2).\nBut the victory leaves Mr. Assad more dependent than ever on Iran and Russia, and so despised by his opponents, including many of Syria\u2019s majority Sunnis, that they might never again accept him as a legitimate ruler. The territory he has reconquered has been won at a devastating cost, and much of the country remains in the hands of his enemies (para. 8). Barnard, A. (2016).

With aircraft and advisers deployed around Syria, Russia has warned Turkey against advancing more than 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) into Syria, said the second U.S. official. For now, the Turkey-backed force has stopped short of al Bab, which is about 30 kilometers from the Turkish border, U.S. officials said. Taking al Bab would expand a buffer zone that Turkey is establishing inside Syria to seal its border from Islamic State infiltration. Turkey's incursion also has prevented the YPG from unifying the northern Kurdish enclaves. Moreover, al Bab's fall to the Turkish-backed force would expand a potential Turkish-protected \"safe zone\" for moderate Syrian rebels, who could base their internationally recognized government-in-exile in the area. The rebels also could use such a zone to re-establish supply corridors from the Turkish border and open a new front aimed at relieving the Syrian regime's siege of opposition-held eastern Aleppo, experts said. \"An eventual reopening of the Aleppo city front is an inevitability,\" said Charles Lister, an expert with the Middle East Institute in Washington. \"The opposition will go whether the Turks want it or not.\" (para. 20-25).

It is staffed by Russian, Turkish, Syrian, Iraqi Shiite and Iranian officers. This mechanism has been put in charge of coordinating Shiite military operations both in Syria and Iraq.\nIt was decided that when US military assistance or air support is deemed necessary, requests will be piped through the bureau of Iraq\u2019s Shiite Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and passed on to the US-Iraqi command of Operation Inherent.\nRussian, Iranian and Turkish officers have thus effectively hitched on to the decision-making process for the Mosul offensive alongside American officers.\nThe irony of this arrangement is that, the US armed the Iraqi army, and indirectly the Shiite militias, for this offensive with top-notch Abrams M1 tanks, M1-198 Howitzers and M88 Recovery vehicles for tanks.

A cynical propaganda effort that attempts to justify mass murder of innocent civilians by claiming the Constitutional requirements require Assad to protect & save those remaining in Aleppo from the true evil - the terrorists who seek to control Aleppo. ( NB Above-mentioned view is @BG1 only). In a parallel universe Assad operates as the Knight In Shining Armour that, has only one objective; to free his subjects from the evil of Terror & Oppression. Any one Group that is at odds with his parallel universe, is a Terror Organization. Also,  questionable that weighing the positives / negatives of such an effort, arguably SRF provided a pedestal to equivocate his already well known positions; especially as there NOTHING that was FACTUALLY new. Otherwise, such an effort would have indeed been justified.  All issues considered the effort nonetheless justified. P.S.

Because of the draw down in U.S. and British combat forces since the end of the Second World War, the Red Army stationed in and around Berlin dwarfed the Western Allied military presence. On June 13, 1948, the administrator of U.S.-occupied Germany General Lucius Clay reported to Washington that \u201cThere is no practicability in maintaining our position in Berlin and it must not be evaluated on that basis.... We are convinced that our remaining in Berlin is essential to our prestige in Germany and in Europe. Whether for good or bad, it has become a symbol of the American intent.\u201d The Truman administration agreed. Based upon written agreements with the Soviet Union in 1945, the only connections to Berlin left to the Western Allies were air corridors from West Germany used to supply Berlin by air. The administration calculated that if the Soviets opposed the airlift with force, it would be an act of aggression against an unarmed humanitarian mission and the violation of an explicit agreement.

Here is why: COMPELLING VESTED INTERESTS OUTWEIGH ASSAD'S DEPARTURE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE Pieces of a Syrian geopolitical puzzle become increasingly clear. First, Putin, Erdogan & Iran have significant &, compelling vested interests  in keeping Assad alive & in power WELL BEYOND the resolution date of this GJ Q on a number of counts: Second, by supporting Assad, Putin is assured of a permanent navel base in Tartus. (1) This UPGRADE has clear strategic implications which are impossible to go unnoticed on the one hand &, increase the present regional disequilibrium as Mikhail Gorbachev warns on the other hand (2) Third, by closing on the GAS PIPELINE deal w/ Putin, Erdogan, has increasing financial & economic leverage to continue his political police state tactics in Turkey by showing his voters he has nonetheless made significant progress in the face of international castigation on increased control of the state.(3)The critical  AKKUYU NPP is back on serious discussion terms as Rosatom & Turkish Energy Minister recently confirmed.(4) Clear incentives for Erdogan & Putin (allowing him to bypass some of its gas around Ukraine).(5) Finally, WATCH WHAT THEY DO, NOT WHAT THEY SAY:  Erdogan has been inconsistent with his public comments on Assad. He must go but, he can remain during transition period (6).   More critically, Erdogan actions establish a clear & convincing conduct that, when looked at through the prism of the GJ O timeline 1/3/17 Turkish, Russian &, obvious Iranian interests have compelling stakes to assure their economic & military investments will be secured for the foreseeable future. Putin continues to express himself in actions in both Syria &, now indisputably with Turkey. Conclusion:\n\nIn combination, the above mentioned make increasingly clear  Assad's presence remains beneficial for the time being to the Russians, Iranians & Turkey. Erdogan on the other hand, is in need of business & economic evidence to continue his cleansing process &, is therefore quite capable continuing his political straddle btw Assad having to go & he can stay for a while. Mikhail Gorbachev's recent warning should be given serious consideration.  With so many moving parts to this geopolitical puzzle, Russian media warnings to their citizens that nuclear conflict is a \"possibility\" should not go unnoticed. (7)Nor should threats by Putin that US/UK aircraft will be shot down should Assad be attacked. (8) Putin, is still considered by the West as an international pariah in spite of UN embargoes, yet retains support at home &, has deftly crafted in the ME geopolitical position that can only ADD to the military risks in this region.  Based upon these facts & circumstances, ASSAD \"may\" indeed suffer the consequences of a Yasser Arafat departure, become deathly ill b/f 1/3/17, or any other unexpected event justifies the 1% consideration. That said, the risks to Russian, Iranian &, increasingly Turkish interests of NOT having Assad in power through this period materially outweigh his being taken out.

My reasoning was more consistent with 0.\n My conscious bias against Putin, Assad, and idealism  that surely world leaders including, even Russia, would in short order terminate Assad. I even mentioned assasination as it is a Putin pattern before (Litvinenko, Politskaya,) and since ( Nemtsov). The UN would stop genocide ongoing for 4 years. I was WRONG.\nSO much for the capacity of the international system to impose  the US and EU view  Roosevelt believed the UN would have such a competence and scope that the 4 \"world policeman\" US, Russia, China (ROK) UK could stop all major conflicts (WWI and WWII) and even stop minor conflicts.

FDR believed that a  rules based international sytem, treaties and covenants reinforced through collective security and enforced by  Security Council:  US, Russia, UK and China would rule the world  FDR was incorrect in believing  that Russia (Stalin) or China (Chiang Kai Shek and now CCP) would be\"pliable\". At the tme of the San Francisco Treaty (1945 ) the  US was responsible for 80% of  world GDP and with the nuclear bomb was the sole uncontested world power.\nOther than Korea, the UN has never  used mikitary force as  a world policemane  in a major confict to enforce international boundaries \nFDR was a visionary and was correct that San Francisco (UN)  Bretton Wood (IMF) would be major institutions  that have contributed to world peace and prosperity. Look at all the amazing work UN and IMF has done and are doing today. But US today, FDR, and WIson were \"naive\" to believe that any treaty or world institution would secure the peace and we continue to be naive. UNCLOS is a classic example. Phillipines with US suport brought Hague  Convention UNCLOS Action to stop PRC massive  campaign to seize the entire South China Sea PRC did not even partcipate. Refused to even recognize Hague Arbitration Tribunal jurisdiction. After the UNCLOS decision, other tha ADIZ, PRC has done everything possible to violate treaty and is not leaving Scarborough shoals.\n\n Now Phillipines, under Duterte, has amost disavowed UNCLOS decision and Duterte orally terminated the US-Phil and Japan-Phil Mutual Assitance Agreenents,while continung to negotiate unilaterally with prc. \n UNCLOS decion and treatty failed there.   This is not my narrative. This is Kissingers narrative in \"Diplomacy\"  K posits 2 competing strands upon which US foreign policy is based.\nWilsonan idealism and  TRoosevelt (realism) But its not a binary choice and  US has and is pursuing both. See Afghan In fact, it is the correlation  of  military forces and state of war in Syria that will dictate outcomes\n In the Clausewitz tradition its simple. US has no goal and will not deploy  military forces in   Syria. Assad and his allies Iran, Hezbollah have deployed overwhelming  military force and now those allies will dictate the outcome. Assad is backed by overwhelming military force  Even assuming Russia withdrew its support, Assad power over   all but the YPG and ISIS controlled areas is complete. The end result has been apparent all  along. The Assad dictatatorship continues into year 47.\nGenocide continues.\nSecretary Kerry  has not understood that Lavrov cannot or will not enter into any agreement or a cease fire.  Even assuming Lavrov wanted a cease fire neither he or Russia, are in a position to control Assad's forces in Aleppo or anywhere outside Latakia Province and Taurus where Russia's naval and airbase are. This does not excuse, but does explain the ongoing war crimes by Assad and all his allies. As for Putin, he decided that, just like the Second Chechen War, the best course it simply  use brute military force   to kill hundreds of thousands  of civilans  and reduce Grozny,and now Aleppo to rubble.     \nAssad Not going anywhere. \nNow Mr. Haf  Director of the Rafik Hariri Center at the Atlantic Council has called this all the way.\n Here is Mr. Haf current appraisal and  another  competing view from WAPO\n https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2016/09/29/the-islamic-state-and-assad-two-sides-of-the-same-coin/?tid=hybrid_collaborative_1_na&utm_term=.3aa9c4ec472d Frederic C. Hof is director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East. Political extremism in Syria \u2014 the kind that combines irreligious sectarianism in the name of Islam with transnational terrorism \u2014 depends on Bashar al-Assad clinging to power. The Islamic State certainly must be beaten militarily, a long process that is painfully overdue. But Assad\u2019s political survival strategy of mass homicide has made Syria fertile ground for vicious forms of criminality distinct from his own. To defeat the Islamic State, we must end the regime\u2019s mass murder: diplomatically if possible, militarily if necessary. The Assad regime is a cause and enabler of the Islamic State. In the early 2000s, it helped midwife al-Qaeda in Iraq, the direct ancestor of the Islamic State, by escorting foreign fighters across Syria and into Iraq. By pursuing a civilian-centric terrorism agenda since 2011 and alienating Sunni Muslims in Syria and around the globe, the regime has boosted the terrorist group\u2019s recruiting and created a territorial vacuum for the ersatz caliphate to fill. The Islamic State is Assad\u2019s enemy of choice, and Assad is the group\u2019s enemy of choice as well \u2014 someone whose depredations fall overwhelmingly on Sunni Muslims it hopes to recruit. President Obama first acknowledged this symbiotic relationship in November 2014 at the Group of 20 summit in Australia. He recognizes that Assad\u2019s war on civilians sustains the Islamic State, but he has never exacted a military price for mass murder. Instead the United States\u2019 strategy in Syria today ineffectively divides the problem into two loosely connected pieces: in the West, watching mass murder while entreating Russia to stop it; in the East, pursuing the Islamic State indecisively with airplanes and a Kurdish militia. No one advocates invading and occupying Syria. Still, the next president should approach Syria in a way consistent with ground truth: The rampant criminality of the Assad regime makes Syria safe for terrorist groups that threaten the United States and its allies. If talks with Russia fail to stop regime atrocities, the president \u2014 our current one or the next \u2014 should seek, select and apply modest military means (such as cruise missile strikes and effective antiaircraft weapons for vetted rebels) to exact a painful price for wanton attacks on hospitals, schools, markets and mosques. Russia and Iran will not like it, but they can prevent it by getting their client out of the mass murder business. No one knows where Syria or Assad will be politically in a year, or three, or five. But we do know this: Nothing politically good can happen in Syria with civilians on the bull\u2019s-eye. Assad\u2019s free ride for mass murder must end for Syria\u2019s future to begin. The Islamic State must be killed militarily and kept from coming back to life, but the missing ingredient has been a sufficiently capable ground force. For military victory over the Islamic State to be sealed, Washington and its allies must prepare their partners in the Syrian opposition to govern liberated areas. All of this is painfully and gratuitously overdue. A regional and European coalition of the willing under U.S. leadership should have been organized right after the Paris attacks of November 2015. Protecting civilians, beating the Islamic State and organizing decent governance for eastern Syria should be the pillars of a strategy to stabilize Syria, to set the stage for real peace talks and to stop the hemorrhaging of terrified humanity from a country ravaged mercilessly by two sides of the same terrorist coin.\" Here is the Counter-argument.\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2016/09/29/assad-must-go-but-regime-change-is-not-the-answer/?tid=a_inl&utm_term=.32ccebf22099\nDerek Chollet, assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs from 2012 to 2015, is a senior adviser at the German Marshall Fund of the United States and author of \u201cThe Long Game: How Obama Defied Washington and Redefined America\u2019s Role in the World.\u201d \"With another cease-fire in tatters and the siege of Aleppo looking more like a modern-day Stalingrad, it may seem tempting to just go ahead and cut a deal with Assad, abandoning the larger goal of his departure from office in order to quell the violence and, perhaps, ease the suffering. Yet it is a fantasy to think we can uproot the Islamic State in Syria with Assad in power; he remains the essential driver of the conflict. With its military might, the United States can \u2014 and has \u2014 disrupted and degraded the Islamic State, whether measured by territory lost, fighters killed or recruits turning away. But defeating the terrorist group requires bringing an end to the Syrian civil war. And that will not happen until Assad is gone. Throughout the Syria conflict, the challenge for the United States has been less about the goal itself \u2014 Assad\u2019s departure \u2014 than the policy tools it should use to achieve it. Although rarely advertised this way, the Obama administration\u2019s approach toward Assad has been one of \u201cmanaged transition\u201d \u2014 it wants him to go, but rather than escalate our involvement in the conflict by decapitating the regime with military power (as the United States did in Iraq and helped to do in Libya), it has aimed to bring about a transition with government institutions intact and able to provide basic services and secure basic order. So what military steps might the next president take to try to gain greater leverage and increase the likelihood that a \u201cmanaged transition\u201d occurs? One idea is an elaboration on the proposal to impose a \u201cno-fly-zone\u201d over parts of Syria. This is not a new concept (as a Pentagon official, I participated in talks with our Turkish allies about the idea four years ago), and since the bombing campaign started in Syria in 2014, the United States has had a de facto no-fly-zone wherever it has been operating. But we could broaden the scope of our current air strikes to hit Islamic State targets closer to where Assad forces are fighting the opposition. At the very least, this could help create ambiguity about what may come next, planting seeds of doubt in Assad\u2019s mind. We are worried about \u201cmission creep,\u201d but so is Assad \u2014 and we could do more to exploit uncertainty so that he starts changing his calculus.\n.\nAnother idea is to pursue a more discrete use of military force \u2014 disrupting Assad\u2019s abilities to plan attacks or destroying things he values, like a helicopter fleet or prized residence. For example, it has been widely reported that the Israelis have been successful conducting military strikes ainst specific regime targets without risking escalation. In addition to actions from the skies, the United States and its partners could increase their support to the Syrian opposition \u2014 both in terms of the kinds of weapons and training they are providing as well as the number of special operations forces assisting them on the ground. As the Syrian opposition continues to develop, it could begin targeting levers of Assad\u2019s control in addition to the Islamic State. None of these steps would be the kind of instant game-changers many clamor for, and they may be accused of being too incremental. But they are the kinds of realistic alternatives the next president should consider. While the risks of escalation with any of these steps must be taken seriously, I believe they are manageable. And to defeat the Islamic State, taking such risks will be necessary.\" Whatever the differences in these analyses; both point to NO UN ELECTION"], [498, "2016-10-02T08:02:34Z", [0.07], "Russia warns US not to attack Syrian forces\nhttp://www.nola.com/military/index.ssf/2016/10/russia_warns_us_not_to_attack.html\nhttp://www.gillettenewsrecord.com/article_661d670d-f8c5-54e4-a0b5-851beaf8541c.html Somehow, what appears to be a restatement of what has consistently been the Russian diplomatic position by Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, has been construed by the unpopulist media to be a THREAT and WARNING to the United States.

When, as part of this GJ exercise, I watched the AlphaGo tournament, I came to an interesting conclusion: namely, that \"global\" phenomena dominate \"local\" phenomena. When you watch the Go games you can see that principle in action. It's like no matter how creatively and conscientiously you build your sand castle on the beach, sooner-or-latter the tide will swamp it and it will be washed away. Now this may not be such a startling or unique insight at all, but we always seem to neglect its import. When Tip O'Neill said that \"All politics is local,\" it is less of a practical guide to political success than it is an INDICTMENT of the way we allow the political system to run. Maybe it's because it's somehow easier to get our heads around \"local\" issues, those for which we think we can comprehend an entire means-end chain, or something like that. But we are kidding ourselves if we think that is where our efforts have the greatest impact. The global issue of what authority the U.S. has to do *anything* in Syria is neglected and languishes unaddressed, while Congress continues to squabble over this-or-that spending authorization. And just like as in the game of Go, this big, giant, global issue is building momentum and a life-of-its-own that will, in the future, come crashing upon the U.S. and swamp, and make pointless, all the work efforts spent on so many local issues. We're in the backyard at a barbecue, there's smoke coming out of a second story window, congress is manning the grill.

And, even if one were to assume that climate change is a dominating global phenomenon, isn't it how people adapt to such environmental changes that matter as well? How about poor soil management practices, or changed irrigation patterns, or basic market economics, or a host of other reasons most scientific thinkers would look to first to explain rural to urban migration before jumping all the way to climate change!

What are the probabilities, when considering the sum of all the geopolitical moving parts as this case represents, that Assad's position is NOT ONLY  strengthened but, in retrospect becomes clear that, the Syrian end game when viewed through a Russian, Iranian &, increasingly through a Turkish lens, includes Assad surviving a WELL BEYOND resolution date of this GJ Q 1/3/17?  SUPPOSITION 1: Assad has NO intention whatsoever of complying with or, being subjected to, any cease fire agreements where - he is not directly involved. Points of Evidence:\na) Assad has directly & immediately in the face of the so-called cease fire dogmatically reiterated his assurance Syrian forces will recapture ALL territories held by terrorists in the Country at Dayara, a Damascus suburb while kicking off Muslim holiday prayers. \nb) He made no reference to cease fire arrangements.( FN1) SUPPOSITION 2: Israeli blog Debkafile intelligence constructs a forward looking scenario that argues that one element of THE end game Russian objective of this so called cease fire has an opposite goal: to seize Daraa, in Southern Syria.(2) UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES or INTENDED CONSEQUENCES &, IF SO, BY WHOM?: \n1. Such a \"deal\" allows Assad to REARM, & regroup militarily providing both time & rest to reposition in line w/ Assad's particular objectives.\n2. As best exemplified by FN2 Assad has been offered through this \"cease fire\" agreement a media platform to make clear his particular objectives, which are sum and substance opposite to Coalition efforts.\n3. To those few that STILL support Assad, he leverages this cease fire to appear as an unbending strongman looking to free his country of the evil that has beset their Syria ( ISIL). \n4. The so-called cease fire enhances the already incontrovertible direct & circumstantial evidence of this Syrian/Russian geologically self serving interests & alliance.  CONCLUSION:\n\nAs usual, WITH  great media fanfare, the Russians & U.S. have agreed to bargain over Syrian interests, WITHOUT the key player being on board - Assad.  It's only a matter of time b/f this cease fire, starts hot again.  For example, IF the deal is to be taken seriously, both US & Russians are required to share sensitive military data on precise locations of the designated enemy.  WHAT happens to this data when the fighting starts up again? In whose hands does this  valuable data fall into? A tactical victory for Putin?  (3) Verbal confidential assurances?  Firewalls? State of the art hackers accessing this data set ? On both sides? Complex issues in the Syrian urban warfare dilemma. Accumulating reliable information  is helpful here. SYNTHESIZING the information to adjust the forecast is what I'm attempting ---- adding it all up ---- leaves Assad with more time & more partners to discuss his EVENTUAL departure which is well b/y resolution date. 1% probability is left for him being \"taken out\" ( the many and varied methods used by Governments today) or \"hit by a truck\"  or,  has a bout of irrecoverable pneumonia. 1) http://app.ft.com/cms/s/95f67c2c-7905-11e6-a0c6-39e2633162d5.html?ftcamp=crm/email//nbe/InTodaysFT/product 2)http://www.debka.com/article/25658/Russia-Dissolve-US-Arab-Israeli-Syria-war-room\n3) https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/whether-or-not-the-syrian-cease-fire-sticks-putin-wins/2016/09/12/6ad73a86-791e-11e6-ac8e-cf8e0dd91dc7_story.html?utm_term=.af9a6352c7cb\nhttp://m.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=11707736"], [23350, "2016-09-13T08:11:37Z", [0.05], ""], [2965, "2016-09-12T23:04:32Z", [0.0], "@dowser was right all along.\nsuch a tragedy\nno glee in a correct call here..."], [2965, "2016-09-12T22:51:31Z", [0.0], "NO way thanks to Putin-Lavrov and Iran\nno track record ever holding a cease fire\nmuch less UN elections.\nThis is ceasefire Number 8\nRight now lets hope the cease fire that has exceptions\nis a real \"cease fire\"\nexceptions prove the rule.\neven Al-Nusra \nno cease fire\n"], [368, "2016-09-12T21:04:15Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2016-09-12T20:42:31Z", [0.0], ""], [5001, "2016-09-12T20:25:09Z", [0.01], ""], [691, "2016-09-12T19:12:51Z", [0.11], ""], [1056, "2016-09-12T19:06:38Z", [0.0], "CNN's summary of the Syrian cease-fire, particularly valuable for the diagram of the crazy quilt of alignments and opponents in the war: http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/12/middleeast/syria-ceasefire-explained/ From what I understand, the actual situation on the ground is far less coherent than the diagram portrays it."], [5386, "2016-09-12T18:43:45Z", [0.1], ""], [23117, "2016-09-12T13:21:18Z", [0.13], ""], [1034, "2016-09-12T04:26:58Z", [0.0], ""], [6303, "2016-09-12T02:06:42Z", [0.03], "According to the general news and GJP consensus."], [11785, "2016-09-12T01:51:49Z", [0.1], ""], [28893, "2016-09-11T19:05:25Z", [0.03], ""], [28902, "2016-09-11T18:50:13Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2016-09-11T18:42:35Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2016-09-11T18:32:37Z", [0.0], ""], [28898, "2016-09-11T14:07:32Z", [0.02], ""], [1034, "2016-09-11T06:16:58Z", [0.0], "Kozak (2016) states that: \nPro-regime forces reinstated the siege of Eastern Aleppo City on 04 SEP following heavy clashes with opposition forces.

Since the U.S. was so eager to get an agreement with Russia, I think the latter is possible. Interestingly, al-Nusra holds a lot of ground in the area around Idlib, so assuming that regime ground troops are still permitted to move against al-Nusra, Assad can refocus his efforts there, and perhaps establish a more direct land link between Latakia province and Aleppo under the U.S.-Russian air umbrella.

Fast forward a year later today, Iran, Russia &, Turkey are developing a combined compelling, vested interest, in maintaining the Assad led Syrian Government status quo WELL BEYOND the resolution date of this GJ Q 1/3/17.   The evidence is increasingly convincing especially as this past year, the geopolitical circumstances have changed, in certain situations, dramatically.  Yet, Assad remains in power. For example, Putin today openly argues for a \"patient change\". (FN1) Iran, on the other hand, is adamant in its support for Assad.(2)  Additionally, post the LACK of any resolution on the Syrian Q at this weekends G20 meeting btw US & Russia, NB attached source that CLAIMS an effort is presently being made by Putin to call a **MOSCOW SUMMIT** later this month 18-22 September  btw Erdogan, Assad & Putin.(3).  CAVEAT: Whether such a \"Summit\" takes place, is an open question.  Another critical question is, however what factor China plays,  in this complex end game scenario which, is worth serious consideration. (4) Here is why.  Assad's existence hangs on the thread of Iranian, Russian &, increasing Turkish interests to carve up, amongst themselves, post Assad's departure, what Syrian geographical & historical opportunities this complex TRIPARTITE  can EXTRACT  after Assad's departure. This requires time, organization & agreement btw all parties well beyond the resolution date of this GJ Q.  Clearly, EU & US interests have been left by the geopolitical wayside. Why? Neither has a clear and compelling vested interest nor justification to officially declare a State of War with the Government of Syria on the one hand (5) nor, are they willing to make a MAJOR POLITICAL commitments to finding a proper political equilibrium for Syria on the other hand.  The \"half way\" measures taken to date, have arguably created greater complexity to a fundamentally irresolvable ME dilemma.  Rather, the political strategy of the West has been to avoid \"Mission Creep\" involvement. A problem both the Russians & Iranians also must now avoid.   NB: even CIA Director Brennan raises the question of \"what that Syrian endgame means\". (6)  No one disputes why Assad must go. (7)  More critically, since the attempted military coup of Erdogan in Turkey, there has been an undeniable \"relative convergence\"  of interests btw Turkey & Russia versus the United States, in any event.  Why?  This question is important because it raises a number of additional critical questions.  1) Did Putin and his intelligence apparatus, have either prior knowledge or, good reason to believe, that Erdogan \"could/would\" be subject to an attempted Military Coup(8)? 2) Did Putin gain w/ Erdogan a certain amount of political good will by providing notice prior thereto ? (8)  3) What effect did/does ( forward looking!) this have on Erdogan's previous \"my way, or the highway\" view of Assad having to go, immediately?   4) Does this chain of events provide Putin with additional influence to bring Erdogan into  the Russian/Iranian fold on providing indirect/direct support for Assad? (8) 5) Is China now an indirect Syrian support for this complex tripartite of Russia, Iranian & Turkish interests in Syria? (4) 6) Under such complex geopolitical stakes, what are national security reasons for direct & indirect involvement by the U.S.  in Syria at this stage ? (5) CONCLUSION: Possibilities such as military coup, assassination, accidental injury resulting in death,bad health or the like continue to exist. These possibilities justify assigning a 2% probability through resolution period. However, when balanced against the above mention facts & changing circumstances, \nalong  w/ causal connections attached thereto, there is a very real probability Assad remain President of Syria b/y 1/3/17.

Rob Richer: U.S. supported Syrian rebels are reducing active operations to lessen chances of a confrontation with Russian supported, pro-Assad forces.   For the most part, they are pulling back to secure operating areas.   Morale in these forces is considered marginal, in part due to the inability of coalition members to protect these forces from increasing Russian supported air or enhanced artillery attacks.   Further, there is an escalating belief within the coalition backed forces, which were primarily established to fight against Assad, that in light of the current election cycle in the U.S., the current anti-Assad operations will remain focused primarily on ISIS. More aggressive operations against Assad will be \"punted\" until a new administration in the U.S. is in place.\" TCB: What is the significance of Assad breaking the truce with Kurdish PYD? RR: Assad is empowered right now with recent successes on the ground in Syria and increasing military and political support from Putin.   Assad also assesses that there is a lessening of support for his immediate stepping down from power by some of the coalition members and regional powers, who are increasingly concerned that the vacuum created by his stepping down \u2013 without a viable opposition or coalition grouping to assume leadership \u2013 would take Syria down the road of Libya or Iraq.   Further, Putin has recently engineered support from Turkey for a more transitional approach to a change in Syrian leadership.  Assad, at Putin's insistence, has given Turkey tacit approval to conduct operations across the Turkish border against ISIS targets, and the actions against the Kurdish PYD are seen as a quid pro quo for the change in Turkish positions regarding Assad.   Turkey believes that the PYD is closely aligned with the Kurdish PKK and is helping support PKK activities within Turkey.\" ROBERT RICHER\nRob Richer retired in November 2005 from the Central Intelligence Agency as the Associate Deputy Director for Operations (ADDO).

Here's a Russian view of the same story: https://www.rt.com/news/357335-kerry-lavrov-talks-syria/ Lavrov's comments of the Turkish incursion, and by implication the U.S. presence: Weighing in on the Turkish \u201cEuphrates Shield\u201d operation in Syria, Lavrov reminded that all countries that had sent military forces to Syria, save for Russia and Iran, are doing so in violation of Syrian sovereignty. \"Many countries are represented by their military and army elements on the ground in Syria, but only the Russian and Iranian contingents are staying there upon consent from Damascus,\" Lavrov said. \u201cSuch is the reality.\u201d It's important to note Lavrov's emphasis on Russia's respect for Syrian sovereignty, and that Russia's actions have been undertaken with the Syrian government's permission. This is one of the most important diplomatic aspects of Russian policy in Syria and elsewhere. Russia paints itself as the guarantor of national sovereignty for states that are in the west's crosshairs. They did this for Milosevic twenty years ago, and to some extent for Saddam Hussein early in this century. This is not incidental, or simply a matter of propriety for the Russians. It is central to their positioning themselves as a reliable ally for regimes that are under siege or otherwise in danger of overthrow by the western powers with the cooperation with international organizations like the UN and ICC. This Russian self-identification as an ally that respects sovereignty and does not overstep its boundaries with its clients makes it virtually impossible for Moscow to depose Assad. If the Russians were to get rid of Assad (or attempt to) they would jeopardize their strategic position in Syria, and even if they could salvage that position, would never again be trusted as a credible sponsor of an embattled regime.

These American fighters are under an authority stretched so thin that it is not even discussed, because doing so would reveal the authority as being abused. These troops are combatants in a foreign country against which the United States has not declared war, and the host government does not welcome them. They are intruders. Somehow the logic that the invading United States combatants have some right to fire upon the Syrian army because of an \"inherent right of self-defense,\" denies to Assad the very same (original) right in repulsing the invaders. Now of course I support the natural right of self defense, but I do not support the policy which has placed these United States soldiers in the predicament to exercise that right under these conditions. As I've said before, if the United States is at war with Assad we should declare it; otherwise we should not be there. Such proxy wars are the legacy of the halcyon age of impunity based on lack of real time visibility. Thank goodness that age is receding. The United States should just give up all these operations and pretenses that seek to deny reality. It's getting a bit embarrassing, this *pretending* and all.

Here is why.   NB: the effort made herein is  to raise forward looking questions that, can impact resolution of this particular question based on the facts, circumstantial evidence and causal connections of a rapidly changing environment.  I have also made every reasonable effort to support the various pro & con assertions made through sources which remain acceptable - albeit with their \"particular bent\" - or narrative on this issue. That said, I may have missed a few points. Apologies in advance if that is the case. Here goes. I. OUTSIDE VIEW: A. RUSSIA, IRAN & TURKEY: A GEOPOLITICAL AXIS OF UNCERTAINTY HAS ESTABLISHED AN INITIAL FOCUS ON SYRIA'S BASHAR HAFEZ al-ASSAD  Hypothesis:  The combined pivot towards Asia on the one hand &, an official exit from the Middle East by the United States on the the other hand,  has opened the door to competing interests.  A new &  more TROUBLESOME  combination of Iranian, Russian & Turkish interests has increasingly found a first \"common thread \" to now operate & compete for - Syrian influence with Assad - that has every reasonable opportunity & consequence to  extend its Syrian frame of reference  into, political affairs including the likes of chaotic war torn areas such Iraq & Kurdistan. http://m.sputniknews.com/middleeast/20160818/1044403105/russia-turkey-iran-syria.html ;  PROPOSITION\nThese combined efforts, will on the one hand, force a result oriented discussion btw all three on Assad's political existence today within a chaos torn Syria. On the other hand, the practical effect of such serious discussions (plans, disagreements, land grabbing efforts) btw the Iranians, Russians & Turkey, will have the practical effect of extending Assad's Presidency beyond the resolution deadline date 1/3/17. B. OPEN ISSUE: CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH A COALITION:  How long before - ISRAELI interests -  discontinue passively noting this development through 2017 is an open question.  For example, NB Debka file, a well connected Israeli intelligence blog that  reported recently relations btw the U.S. & TURKEY  had deteriorated  http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/turkey-military-coup/turkey-s-erdogan-calls-obama-extradite-u-s-based-fethullah-n633596\nto the extent that the U.S. has quietly decided to commence EVACUATION of US nuclear weapons from Incirlik.  http://app.debka.com/p/article/25613/Rushed-evacuation-of-US-nukes-from-Incirlik.   NB: Cannot confirm this \"claim\" through ANY other sources at this stage. Therefore, during  the remainder of the U.S. Presidential election phase through year end, this Turkish/U.S. CHILL  in geopolitical relations has close to 0% chance of heating up; especially in the face of a recently leaked German report that Turkey remains a major Islamist hub.\nhttp://legalinsurrection.com/2016/08/erdogans-turkey-is-a-major-islamist-hub-says-leaked-german-intel-report/;\nhttp://m.dw.com/en/turkeys-ruling-akp-party-has-history-of-links-to-islamist-groups/a-19480952 Without dispute, Turkey and the  Russians have clearly reset their relationship, for various reasons. http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2016/08/turkey-russia-reset-160808103350290.html. Partly for economic reasons. https://www.worthynews.com/24308-erdogan-putin-agree-multi-billion-energy-deal\nTaken separately, such a reset is at the very least noteworthy. When considered, however, from the combined perspective as the above-referenced hypothesis, however, it is cause for concern. http://app.ft.com/cms/s/bbcd39ba-5b0d-11e6-9f70-badea1b336d4.html?ftcamp=crm/email//nbe/FirstFTAsia/product&siteedition=intl ; it is not only a Russian - Turkish reboot. Turkey has every intention to extend this frame of reference towards Iran as well. http://m.fredericksburg.com/news/news-wire/turkish-foreign-minister-pays-surprise-visit-to-iran/article_b4ab368b-92ff-5e16-bcfe-1394c5805ec8.html?mode=jqm C. CAN ....ASSAD ....HOLD OUT ANOTHER SIX MONTHS, UNDER THESE CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES?  Specifically, the timeline on resolution of this particular GJ Q is 1/3/17. Slightly over six months for Assad to cease being President of Syria.  Thus, this arguably virulent confluence of interests has geopolitical uncertainty issues written in CAPITAL letters, irrespective of the eventual departure of Assad forcibly, or otherwise w/in the resolution deadline date of 1/3/17.  What happens thereafter, is significantly MORE critical than his departure. Suffice it to say, Iran, Russia & Turkey are developing vested political & economic interest today to work together well beyond this GJ Q resolution deadline date. This applies for Assad \"political existence\" as well.  On Syria, each of these participants can be expected to move cautiously with respect to the existence of Assad in his present position considering critical comments from CIA Director Brennan that the last thing the U.S. wants is Assad to go overnight = Syrian political implosion.  D. DRILLING DOWN FROM THE OUTSIDE VIEW For example, on the one hand, with Assad refusing to leave at this stage, the IRANIANS continue to provide him both direct & indirect support.  The RUSSIANS on the other hand, in spite of all the International Sanctions, have successfully continued acting as a \"political buffer\" of support for Assad while, fundamentally pursuing their own particular strategic interests which cuts both ways ( NB: What is the Syrian endgame : CRITICAL point : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRCUO7-lbUE&sns=em  @ 26min CIA Director Brennan on why the last thing the US wants is Assad to go out overnight - Syrian implosion.  Add to this mix, the TURKISH development  w/  Erdogan (who would rather be \"done\" w/  Assad \"tomorrow\"). However, he has nonetheless, made a very clear public PIVOT towards the Russians. Whether Erdogan is willing to negotiate w/ the Russians & Iranians on Assad is an open question. The following point however is telling. http://m.sputniknews.com/politics/20160816/1044334091/turkey-concessions-russia-iran-syria.html  Critically, the more Erdogan is \"cornered & tagged as a tyrant\" by the West in economic terms, the greater the probability is, that he continues his pivot towards other Highly Questionable Regimes which, only increases the probability of increased instability - in exactly the areas the U.S., U.N. & the EU clearly - have a vested interest to return to a reasonable form of political equilibrium.  Finally, IRAN, on the other hand, has equally interesting opportunity to consider such a strategic cooperation at this stage of their development. http://m.sputniknews.com/middleeast/20160814/1044255897/russia-iran-turkey-syria-partnership-analysis.html. Therefore, viewed from the totality of recent developments, it is indisputable that here too, the Russians are indeed making progress  the Iranians as well! \nhttp://www.dailyprogress.com/news/world/wire/iran-acknowledges-russia-using-its-air-base-to-strike-syria/article_14ea0c18-7346-5f5d-83f4-5953596499bc.html. Clearly, the Iranians also have an interest in ramping up their military purchase of Russian technology/equipment http://m.sputniknews.com/world/20160812/1044189048/iran-russian-weapons.html?utm_source=https%3A%2F%2Ft.co%2FiCGvhcav9l&utm_medium=short_url&utm_content=bUaP&utm_campaign=URL_shortening and, whether or NOT use of Iranian flight territory as bases for ALEPPO airdrops by the Russians is a violation of UN rules, one has to wait upon for a political decision. http://thewire.in/59872/russia-use-of-iran-base-may-violate-un-resolution/\nhttp://www.ctvnews.ca/mobile/world/russia-striking-syria-from-iran-does-not-violate-sanctions-1.3031911. There is also discussion btw the Russians & Iranians that such an air facility may be possible on a \"semi-permanent basis. NB: https://www.stratfor.com/analysis/iran-russias-new-staging-post  The critical point is, Putin has once again, taken advantage of a West sanctions imposed environment to extend his frame of reference FROM Syria, TO Iran & more recently Turkei.  It is therefore clear,  a geopolitical battleground for influence by Countries increasingly \"snubbed by the West\"  as either prone to terrorism, managed by tyrants and/or, subject to various and sundry trade embargoes, has been set. http://m.fredericksburg.com/news/news-wire/turkey-iran-pledge-cooperation-over-syria/article_b73565b8-4d5b-5769-9d8f-4fc69f1bb9a3.html?mode=jqm QUESTION: Has the West, through its various international sanctions &, limitations upon trade, economic & political actions over the past few years essentially provoked and or, provided an increased incentive for the Iranians, Russians &, Turks to establish their own political & economic axis/sphere of interest DESPITE, differences over what to do w/ Assad? We're all up the speed on the ugly mayhem of Aleppo which the world simply \"equivocates about in adjectives\".  Assad's stamp of \"Grausamkeit\" is encapsulated in Saydnaya prison https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/aug/18/saydnaya-prison-syria-assad-amnesty-reconstruction?ftcamp=crm/email//nbe/FirstFTEurope/product which alone  is justification for his immediate departure but, the facts on the ground make clear this NEW AXIS will make every effort to increasingly  conduct operations together, which has a significantly different timeline than this GJ Open Question. http://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2016/08/12/479664/Iran-Turkey-Russia-Zarif CONCLUSION: The uncertainties remain substantial. Turbulence is guaranteed. Considering the above mentioned, Assad's time in his present position is indeed limited. On the one hand, a 95% forecast that Assad remains in his position for another six months leaves me quite  close to a Brier Score disaster in the event of a successful one off effort to get rid of This Person. On the other hand, the probability calculation is a compilation of well considered circumstances leading to reasonable judgement that Assad's chances or remaining President over the next six months still  remain very good."], [691, "2016-08-19T19:41:46Z", [0.14], ""], [90, "2016-08-19T19:28:40Z", [0.5], ""], [1262, "2016-08-19T18:53:36Z", [0.88], "Increasing based on @dowser's post & links.

I would imagine the price of this would be inclusion of the Kurds under the rubric of \"terrorists,\" and Iranian and Russian support for  an anti-Kurdish campaign by Turkey. This would mean that every faction that has a territorial claim on Syria would be a target of the Russia-Iran-Turkey coalition, thus opening the way for a reunification of Syria within its pre-2011 borders. I have no idea if this would succeed, and it will certainly fail without a ruthless application of military force that completely ignores the laws and customs of warfare. But it looks like the new Russia-Iran-Turkey alignment is developing, and I think the big losers will be the Kurds.

As that battle raged, the US was drafting a deal with Russia that would create a joint operations centre to coordinate attacks on al-Nusra and Islamic State. The move has created despair among the ranks of the Syrian opposition, which insists that a pact between Moscow and Washington will entrench the Syrian leader, whom Russia and Iran have saved from defeat over the past 12 months. Adding to the alarm of the now diminished rebel ranks is a detente, also signed during the week, between Moscow and Ankara, after a seven-month standoff, as well as the Turkish prime minister\u2019s remarks that Ankara was interested in peace with Damascus. \u201cThis all means that Assad is no longer at risk,\u201d said a senior official in the western-backed Syrian opposition. \u201cThis means that he has won.\u201d\" With the continuing ISIS atrocities, no western power any longer has any interest in fighting Assad.

It has left an incalculable power vacuum that is now being fought over btw Iran, the Saudi's, the Russians & of course Turkey.  There is both direct & indirect evidence of this in Syria for example. Putin has taken advantage of the official U.S. departure from Iraq, by aiding and abetting Assad. He is stronger today than in 2015. Without dispute. Recalling of course that Obama argued over a hear ago, Assad's days are numbered. Additionally, we see the Iranians both indirect &, direct support to Syrian backed forces for example who readily support Assad's forces in their battle against ISIS. More critically, POST the unsuccessful Military Coup, Erdogan's power is now approaching insurmountable internal political competition for the foreseeable future. Turkish  PM  Binali Yildirim recent message that Turkey will continue to IMPROVE its relationship w/ Syria must not be under estimated.

It's a complex mix w/ U.S. interests having FAR less of an influence. This was my point.  So why not consider that probability of something that hasn't happened before? It's usually/always what never happens before that has the BIGGEST impact?  What are the probabilities of a Russian, Turkish, Iranian improvement of relationships with all of the side effects for those Israeli & U.S. Interests in contested Middle East locations such as Syria & Iraq?

The proposal EXTENDS  the battle beyond ISIS to al-Nursa. Recall, al-Nursa is fighting ASSAD. So, w/ the U.S. providing support to Russia & Iran to battle al-Nursa, it indirectly is providing Assad w/ a free hand to focus his efforts elsewhere.

Anybody heard anything about this? It's a new one on me.

Mao Zedong said, \"A revolution is not a dinner party,\" but evidently a lot of people think a civil war is. The problem with NGOs is that they compare countries that are wracked by civil war with 21st century western countries. They should be comparing Syria to the United States from 1861 to 1865, or to Great Britain from 1641 to 1649, or to France between 1789 and 1799. It might give them a little perspective on what actually happens when heavily armed people believe they have to kill or be killed, and atrocity and reprisal follow upon one another regularly, with each reprisal being the next atrocity in the chain.

True, the part about Russian finances being strained is well known, but it's quite another thing to say that Moscow is \"financially incapable of sustaining a military venture that has no guaranteed outcome.\" At best, very few military ventures in history have had a guaranteed outcome, and even robust Russian finances would not guarantee the outcome of this one. And they appear to be financially capable of maintaining the current level of operations; what matters is, if they cut back, would the rebels and/or ISIS rebound and threaten the survival of the Assad regime? Who knows? You certainly won't find out by reading this article. All in all, a poorly reasoned and argued piece; if this is what the Saudis are thinking, they need to step up their game.

This dispute also bedevils the Syrian regime (and Hizbullah), which finds itself between the Russian hammer and the Iranian anvil especially as the clashes escalate among the various forces and militias operating in different regions of Syria.\" The Daily Beast, June 20, 'U.S. and Russian Jets Clash Over Syria - American and Russian fighter jets had a tense showdown in the skies above Syria as the Russians dropped bombs on U.S.-backed rebels': http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/06/19/u-s-and-russian-jets-clash-over-syria.html\n@lsgold7 , your thoughts?"], [691, "2016-06-21T00:17:49Z", [0.18], ""], [368, "2016-06-20T22:07:40Z", [0.05], ""], [14777, "2016-06-20T21:05:44Z", [0.04], ""], [24563, "2016-06-20T20:45:23Z", [0.2], ""], [4638, "2016-06-20T12:29:15Z", [0.02], "There are three main factors that go into my low percentage:  (1) In regards to anything regarding middle eastern conflicts that involve rival factions, fulfilling a goal ALWAYS seems to take longer than anticipated. Look at Fallujah, Iraq for example. The city began becoming \"retaken\" weeks ago, and there are still reports of Northern Iraq being controlled by ISIS. (2) Russia is backing Assad, and we are losing support from Turkey's Erdogan. (3) I believe that Assad can cease being president if US sends massive numbers of forces into Syria to fight the regime. However, this is completely disregarding the problem of Al-Qaeda's presence in Syria. But, the question is explicitly referring to Assad. Regardless of who becomes president of the US, I find it unlikely that either Hillary nor Trump will send in lots of troops. Trump seems to be more of an isolationist, not wanted to get too much into nation building in another country, but he does seem to support more US ground troops in the region. However, \"more\" is not the massive number needed to completely get Assad out of office.

They seem to hint at that, but also don't want to compromise relations with Russia. So what if a Russian jet crosses into the no-fly zone? What if it attacks a rebel target? What do they propose to do? Shoot it down? Will they shoot down a Syrian plane over Syrian airspace? That's an act of war against Syria. Countries are after all sovereign over their own airspace. What are the long-term implications of that? Would that leave U.S. ships off the coast legally liable to attack? Suppose, after the U.S. shootdown of a Syrian plane over Syria, the regime launched an anti-ship missile from Latakia province and hit a U.S. ship. Would the U.S. then start bombing targets inside regime territory in retaliation? Would the Russians just permit that to happen, and not patrol over Syrian territory, enforcing their own \"no-fly zone\" over regime-held areas? The authors of the memo can't decide if this is a geostrategic issue, a moral issue, a way of ending the refugee crisis, or part of the war against ISIS. Of course, it could be all these at once, but they never really say that, either. They keep shifting the focus, as if to satisfy the priorities of different groups of people so they can sign the memo. So they want robust military action, but not too robust; they want the rebels protected against air attacks, but not if it means facing off against the Russians; they want to reinvigorate the diplomatic process, but also say that they do not want to escalate U.S. involvement beyond a certain threshold. So if Assad can take whatever punishment they dish out, there is no Plan B in the memo. They say, \"U.S. military power would serve to promote regime compliance with the CoH.\" [\"CoH\" = the ceasefire] But what if it doesn't promote such compliance? What then? They never say.

As everyone commenting on this IFP agrees, if there were some way to get rid of Assad and still get what they want, the Russians would be happy to get rid of him. But they can't, so they won't. I'm sure their efforts to get the regime to concede this point were strictly pro forma.

All other rebel groups will dissolve or be absorbed by the jihadist militias. \"Russian officials have used their influence on Mr Assad sparingly, claiming that he is not a close ally. Their US counterparts say that this may also be because Moscow does not have as much power over the president as once believed.\" Comment: Of course the Russians never had that kind of power. It means the power to persuade Assad to risk life imprisonment. No one would be able to do that. \"Yet many diplomats believe there would be no love lost between Mr Assad and Russia if and when a deal emerges. \u201cAs soon as they ensure the regime survives, the Russians will be done with him,\u201d one western official said. \u201cThe day after, Assad is going to \u2018accidentally\u2019 fall from a plane.\u201d Comment: Actually, the form the deposition of Assad would take would be a domestic coup undertaken by Syrians. Russia couldn't be implicated in the assassination of Assad without losing credibility. Russia would be demonstrating to its client dictators that Moscow considers them disposable. This is not a way to keep allies. No one will agree to become dependent on Russia just to be killed on Moscow's orders whenever Moscow likes. This is another reason that Russia can't get rid of Assad. If they were to do so, it would mean that they would be throwing away everything they gained.

Be warned. http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/04/18/bashar-al-assads-war-crimes-exposed The article concerns the efforts of the activists to document the regime's human rights abuses. The success of this documentation effort means that Assad will never take a \"deal.\" He can't; there is a mountain of evidence that would be used against him in a prosecution. Any state (i.e. Russia or Iran) that granted him asylum would take a massive hit to its prestige and diplomatic standing, and perhaps face some economic pressure. And for what? One thing every forecaster agrees on is that neither Russia nor Iran cares about Assad personally. They care about his personal well-being only insofar as it affects their own interests. Neither Russia nor Iran is willing to sacrifice anything for him as a person, and would gladly hand him over for trial rather than carry the onus of harboring him. The article points out that only the UN Security Council can authorize an International Criminal Court prosecution, and that the investigation of Assad's regime is being undertaken by an unofficial agency. But given the support that agency has from many governments, it is easy to imagine a government that claims universal jurisdiction over human rights indicting Assad and his top lieutenants. In that case it would be extremely difficult for the ICC to not press for an indictment, even if it could not persuade the UNSC to authorize one. Moreover, it would be quite difficult for Iran or Russia to ignore an extradition request, given that Iran is now finally normalizing its international relations, and Russia faces sharply decreased revenues.

But two things are noteworthy: first, the Alawite dissident movement is headquartered in Turkey, and according to its founder Fouad Hamira, \"...the Alawites currently serving in opposition groups were mostly \u201ccommunists or secularists.\u201d He wishes to herald yet another revival - an opposition group based on a solid Alawite identity - apart from Assad.\" So there's an existing opposition, this is just an attempt to create an alternative opposition. It may have a better chance of succeeding than the secularists have, but that remains to be seen. But here's the real problem: \"But Hamira believes that not only Alawites must strike a more reconciliatory chord. Some of the numerous opposition groups must \u201ctone down their sectarian diatribe,\u201d he said.\" If the Alawites don't believe that the Sunnis will be conciliatory, they will stick with Assad no matter how dissatisfied they are. The Yazidis were a marginalized group without any political power, and were massacred and enslaved. The Alawites are a minority, hated for their abuses while in power, and have given the Sunnis ample reasons to engage in reprisals when the time comes. The Alawites have no choice but to fight or to negotiate a partition of Syria that gives them independence or at least a level of autonomy that makes them effectively sovereign in their own territory. They have too much at stake to rely on the promises and good faith of their enemies. There is no second chance if a group's strategy of conciliation turns out to be wrong or if the other side reneges on promises to forswear retaliation. Somewhat related is this: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/03/16/putin-cant-last-forever-will-a-post-putin-russia-look-like-syria-today/ Interestingly, this article is dated two days before the al-Arabiya article and gives pretty much exactly the opposite picture of the Alawites. But the article itself is about the tenuousness of Putin's hold on power in Russia. This is why I consider any prospect of Assad \"retiring\" to Russia to be impractical. Under the current international law regime, there would be absolutely no way to immunize Assad (or anyone else) from prosecution for war crimes. Even if some state were to give him asylum, the charges against him would stand; the charges would not be voided simply because trying Assad was impractical or even impossible. Any post-Putin regime, no matter what its political orientation, could gain international prestige by handing over Assad to the ICC or some other tribunal. This action would be virtually cost-free for the new Russian regime, and its political payoff would easily be greater than the benefit of letting Assad stay on in Moscow, or Sochi, or wherever. Assad knows this, and realizes that he has only three alternatives: in power, in prison, or dead.

The word \u201ccease\u201d is important, because there are multiple possibilities for Assad to vacate his position. For example, he could die, but that is a long shot. There are no reports of Assad suffering any health issues or preexisting medical conditions, and he is only 49 years old. This makes the likelihood of natural death unlikely. (Kudos to Aches for raising this possibility, hadn't considered it.) Despite the assassination of several generals throughout the civil war, there are no reports of problems with Assad's personal security. A successful assassination attempt is doubtful, with only one mediocre attempt reported from a major news outlet (http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/insidesyria/2013/08/201381181226943357.html) in August 2013. An internal coup is also unlikely, as the majority of top government personnel are Alawite and linked to the Assad family, making them fairly loyal. Assad could flee the country and thus cease to be President of Syria, but this too is unlikely. The recent reversal of fortune on the battlefield and reports of the US accepting Assad as the President of Syria for at least another year (http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/us-sees-assad-staying-power-until-least-march-2017-report-23413683) leave Assad is a strong position with no real reason to leave Syria. If he left now with no guarantees for diplomatic protection under a deal, he could face prosecution for war crimes in the future. With the death and cowardice unlikely to change the course of the Syrian civil war, a negotiated settlement is the only real reason Assad would cease to be President of Syria. So what are the odds of diplomatic talks sending Assad packing? Not good. Two sources (http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/weekinreview/24bowley.html and https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/10/23/political-science-says-syrias-civil-war-will-probably-last-at-least-another-decade/) suggest an end to the current conflict in Syria is unlikely. The average civil war last around 10 years, meaning a conclusion to the conflict in Syria is improbable. The chances of the Syria becoming an outlier of that average are slim as it meets several conditions for prolonged fighting, including intervention by foreign powers and a multitude of factions in the fray. The odds of a negotiated settlement are even worse than an end to the fighting. According to a similar source (http://politicalviolenceataglance.org/2013/10/18/the-four-things-we-know-about-how-civil-wars-end-and-what-this-tells-us-about-syria/) the chance of a negotiated settlement in any civil war is around 25%. That chance depends on two factors, explained in the source, that have a lower probability of occurring, undermining the chance even further of a negotiated settlement. The odds of the rebels military defeating Assad are also considerably low. Rebels have a 35% average of a decisive military victory in a civil war. But Syrian rebels forces are fighting Assad, PYG Kurds, ISIS/Daesh, Shiite militias, Hezbollah, and amongst themselves. Their stronghold of Aleppo is close to encirclement, which threatens supplies necessary to sustain armed opposition. Supported by Russia and Iran, the Syrian Army is unlikely to face a similar strain on resources. The West and its Gulf allies are focused primarily on combating terrorism, not ousting Assad from power, leaving the rebels to fend for themselves.  In summary:\nAssad is likely to survive until March 1, 2017. The chances of a successful assassination attempt or an internal coup are low. (+ 3%)\nHe is unlikely to flee the country. (+3%)\nThe odds of a negotiated settlement before March 1, 2017 are quite low, and those odds decrease when you consider how much the question of Assad leaving offices slows or even stalls diplomatic talks. Even if negotiations are successful, the chances of removing Assad from power before March 1, 2017 are low. (25% base for negotiated settlements, subtract 15% for lack of factors that lead to successful negotiations, subtract 5% for declining support of \u201cAssad Must Go\u201d in diplomatic talks: +5%)\nThe probability of a military victory over the Syrian Army by the rebels is also quite low. (35% base rate but when considering average length of civil wars, relative strength of rebel enemies, recent battlefield setbacks, etc. I think dropping it to +5% is generous.)  I conclude there is a 16% chance of Assad ceasing to be President of Syria by March 1, 2017. **** UPDATE: Lowering due to new Iranian \"Red Line\" - 11%"], [83, "2016-04-03T00:15:34Z", [0.8], "Reports of US Russian discussions on Assad:\nhttp://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/03/31/russia-denies-report-deal-to-give-syrias-assad-refuge-in-another-country.html Are followed by meetings by Ergodan meetings with Kerry, then Obama, in Washington (US reportedly supports effort against the PKK terrorist group in Turkey, but not the Kurdish groups in Syria):\nhttp://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/Default.aspx?pageID=517&nID=97175&NewsCatID=352"], [14372, "2016-04-02T23:26:45Z", [0.09], ""], [1262, "2016-04-02T20:19:52Z", [0.1], "Confirming previous forecast"], [368, "2016-04-02T18:11:28Z", [0.15], ""], [691, "2016-04-02T14:53:38Z", [0.28], ""], [755, "2016-04-02T04:05:38Z", [0.65], "al-Assad digs in after Palmyra win.

That doesn't mean they aren't there, but probably not in significant numbers. My guess is special forces. http://www.reuters.com/article/mideast-crisis-syria-idUSKCN0VN03B That the Assad regime feels confident enough to announce a move against Raqqa once it takes Aleppo is noteworthy. And perhaps the most noteworthy quote is this one: \"The U.S. government said Assad was \"deluded\" if he thought there was a military solution to the conflict.\" If Assad succeeds in regaining control of all Syria, it will change the popular perspective on great-power intervention in their clients' wars. Right now, the model is Vietnam. From this, people around the world (and especially the U.S.) extrapolate that great power intervention is always a failure, and may even be counterproductive to the great power's intentions. If Syria is reconstituted as a result of Russian intervention, the assumption about the efficacy of intervention will change. Russia is completely indifferent to condemnation, and is single-minded in pursuing its goal. The lesson is that if a great power intervenes and is willing to shrug off world opinion and do what it thinks it must, it will succeed. I'm not sure that the Syria intervention can actually be considered an example applicable elsewhere, but I don't think there was any reason to think that Vietnam was universally applicable either. Nevertheless, the Vietnam intervention was widely seen to provide such a \"lesson.\"  How many times since September have we heard warnings of a Russian \"quagmire\" in Syria?  There are a couple of  qualifications I have to make. First, the Balkan air campaigns of the 1990s succeeded. NATO's goals were met in both Bosnia and Kosovo. But the goal was limited; it was to force a negotiated settlement. Syria is different. The goal there is the active conquest (or reconquest) of territory held by the enemy. The closest thing I can think of since 1945 is the Indian intervention to secure the independence of Bangladesh in 1971. But that was a quick blitzkrieg that produced a fait accompli. It wasn't a gradual systematic series of operations as Syria is. Syria may show that a great power can engage in a war involving multiple continuing operations,  and succeed.

If no cease-fire occurs, hostilities could result in an even more human tragedy and waves of migration.

The most pointed occured in July of 2012 after a group of military officers defected to form the Free Syrian Army (http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2077348,00.html). During the ripples of this defection, the al-Assad family fled to the Alawite North-West of Syria, leading to even greater speculation that his end was near.(http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/9412126/Syria-Bashar-al-Assad-flees-to-Latakia.html) That was nearly four years ago. Why is al-Assad still in power? The history of Syria: the way in which it was administered by landed elite under the Ottomans, followed by the chaotic years following French mandate, Hafez al-Assad's essentially plebian revolution and later slide back towards a system of landed elite; all of this plays a role in the current situation. Al-Assad is seen by those with purses and guns as the only game in town, what's more, he's the only one with a real bureaucracy in place to handle the duties of a state. While the main pillars of that bureaucracy have fallen, the violence pillar remains. This is not a functional state by any means, but it is much better than any can offer.  Further, the question itself misunderstands how deep the problem of unseating al-Assad is: forcing him from Damascus and into hiding didn't mean the end in 2012 and it wouldn't in 2016. The defection of military officers certainly scared the regime and forced his family to retreat temporarily, but they were ultimately able to weather the storm and return. Even after military successes, there is no force (outside of, perhaps, ISIS) with an organizational structure that would allow them to run a replacement state. Thus, even if they become more powerful militarily, they would be unable to govern and al-Assad forces would fight from strongholds claiming legitimacy and waiting for the dominant rebel group to fall apart. Samer Aboud does an excellent job at discussing how the regime arrived at its monopoly on organization (http://www.jadaliyya.com/pages/index/23444/syria_an-interview-with-samer-abboud), though he's forced to leave out a great amount of detail. When I started, I selected 5%, but even leaving 2% seems generous, both Iran and Russia appear to be in a dollar auction situation supporting al-Assad (http://www.mediate.com/articles/noll1.cfm).

But he is at the middle of a fundamental disagreement over Syria's future, one to which there is, as yet, no clear middle ground. The question of whether he stays or goes has become a question about the degree to which Syria does or doesn't return to the prewar status quo, and right now the major parties of this war just can't agree on that. Syria's opposition, after years of enduring Assad's barrel bombs and chemical weapons, and the forced disappearances and torture chambers before them, have said over and over they could never accept that Assad stay in office. But it's not just that rebel leaders won't accept it; Assad has so completely alienated the country's Sunni majority that his very ability to govern the country, in peace or war, may well be gone. His policies are such a driver of sectarianism that he makes the country ungovernable, and peace is simply impossible while he remains in office. So when people say that Assad has lost legitimacy and has to go, that's not an opinion but rather an analytical fact about Syria. At the same time, Russia and especially Iran, whether we like it or not, are so involved in the conflict that they have effective veto power. And they see the Assad regime as essential for preserving their interests in Syria, and have demonstrated they're willing to accept significant losses to keep him in power. There are hints that those countries might be willing to push out Assad, but both would almost certainly want to replace him with another Alawite, thus keeping the regime basically the same. And it's not even clear that Russia or Iran can push out Assad. Moscow reportedly tried to remove him in December and failed. The Syrian regime still stands behind Assad, and Russia ultimately can't tell them what to do. The fact that Assad can play Russia and Iran off one another \u2014 there have been reports of long-running tension between them over Syria \u2014 makes it easier for him to stand up to them. The only other obvious option, supporting rebels until they can topple Assad by force, would invite a disaster potentially even worse than we have now. Syrians are already suffering mass displacement and, with state services in many places nonexistent, face extreme poverty, disease outbreaks, and hunger. They cannot endure the collapse of what little of the state remains. In the majority of the country where Assad has lost control, territory is divided among many different rebel groups. Were Assad to fall, they would lose their common enemy and could turn on one another. In such conditions, ISIS would almost certainly come out ahead. Many warn that should Syria's government collapse, it would follow Libya's path to chaos and infighting. But this may actually understate the problem. It's more likely, perhaps, that Syria would look like Afghanistan in the 1990s, when the collapse of the pro-Soviet government led to years of civil war among rebel groups, many of whom became more like warlords, and provided the conditions for the rise of the Taliban. ~~~~ COMMENT: Sort of seems like the international community is stuck between a rock and a hard place, but that's obviously a fluid assessment.

The factions in Syria are not interested in propaganda victories. They are interested in battlefield victories. There have been several regime victories in succession recently, and no rebel victories to speak of (except ISIS gains). The rebels are going into the talks from a position of weakness, so they understandably feel that it's best to not even begin. For the rebels to negotiate under these circumstances could be interpreted as a prelude to surrender.  I'm waiting for some western diplomat to start talking about the \"moral high ground.\" Right now, Assad's army is taking the topographical high ground in northern Latakia. Once that's secure, the Latakia redoubt will be close to impregnable; the rebels would be unable to even attack it without catastrophic losses. And the odds of any such attack succeeding would be nil. But we have western diplomats talking about perceptions. Events on the ground are shaping the future of Syria, and everyone with an actual stake in the war knows it.

John Kirby, a spokesman, described the document as a \"staff-level think piece\" that is \"preliminary and pre-decisional\" and not \"an official position.\" However, the document reflects details of a plan negotiated in Vienna in November for a ceasefire followed by a new constitution and a transitional government.

The only things he has said he rules out completely are negotiations with ISIS and al-Nusra, which the west also rules out. Since Putin has indicated that he will entertain anything that is suggested, it's impossible to divine what outcome he would really support in the end. Putin wants to position himself as the most reasonable guy in the mix; he supports Assad, but not unconditionally, he also arms (he says) selected rebel groups; he's semi-allied to Iran, but takes no action when Israel bombs Hezbollah positions; he contributes to international efforts to end the war, and votes with the other members of the Security Council to call for a ceasefire and talks.  He will essentially give a conditional \"yes\" to any question anybody asks him. His statements are just diplomatic technique; none of them really commits him to anything. Here's my reading of Putin's mind: If in the end it turns out that he doesn't want to support something, he can say, \"Well, I didn't dismiss the idea, but I was never definitely in favor of it.\" If in the end he agrees to something that was suggested, he can say, \"I had always thought that that was the best approach.\" With regard to the matter of Assad being exiled to Russia, Assad can read the news too, and Putin knows that. If Putin has anybody in mind to replace Assad, Assad would get rid of that candidate immediately. This is assuming that Putin could depose Assad, which in my view is nearly impossible anyway. I think the hype about \"Putin is willing to give asylum to Assad\" doesn't mean anything.

So on the face of it Putin's idea does not seem to have any possibility of happening. However Putin does not say things without a reason, so the question is why did Putin mention elections at all? It could be that Putin has realised that his airpower is not going to win the war for Assad. If so the options are for Iran to send in large numbers of ground troops (which would upset the Sunni states and US), or Russia to send in a lot of ground troops, which could see Russia bogged down in an unwinnable war similar to what happened in Afghanistan in the 1980s or for some way be found so that Russia and Iran can get out of Syria without loss of face.

In 2012, rebel fighters captured at least one of the systems from the Syrian military. In the years since, videos uploaded by Islamist group Jaysh al-Islam have shown the militia's fighters firing on Syrian aircraft with the 9K33 Osa system. The report from October claims that the 9K33 Osa was in the hands of the Islamic State (IS) terror group and was destroyed in Douma, though IS forces do not currently hold any territory in Douma. Myriad rebel factions control that area, with the dominant one being Jaysh al-Islam. No specific location or owner was listed for the December strike.

There will be no concession,\u201d he told reporters on Friday.\" Since the Geneva Communique prescribes  a \"transitional governing body with full executive powers,\" and that means no \"President,\" Assad will never agree to this.

If either side backs down on this one issue, it's the equivalent of abandoning its entire position and caving in to the other side.

Western officials are bouncing back and forth about the issue of not indicting Assad before he leaves office. But some of them are leaving open the possibility of trying him after he leaves office. This is why Assad will never take a deal; even people who are willing to give him immunity will rescind that immunity as soon as they can get their hands on him. Iran or Russia could give Assad asylum, but either power would be under pressure to surrender him if they took him in. The best way for them to avoid the cost of sheltering him is to just leave him in place.

No one (including me) has commented on the recent history of Russian reactions to U.S. interventions abroad. During the Balkan interventions of the 1990s, Russia's position was that western intervention in Yugoslavia was illegal, arrogant, high-handed and a violation national sovereignty. Since then, Russia has been positioning itself as the champion of small countries resisting U.S. intervention, and dismissing U.S. and western moral justifications as a smokescreen for economic or other interests.  I have no interest is discussing the merits of Russia's position regarding intervention, but I bring it up because I think Russia's stance as defender of small counties' sovereignty makes it difficult for them to directly force any kind of settlement on Assad, let alone engineer his overthrow. They have not placed themselves in this role in order to throw it away; you can't be an unconditional supporter of national sovereignty and then overthrow an inconvenient client, or force a deal down his throat.  Russia may \"declare victory and get out\" between now an March 1, 2017, and if they did, that would change the situation drastically. I doubt if they'll do that within the time frame, however. States that project power don't accept humiliation lightly, and Putin would not want to show lack of resolve to his domestic jihadists.

So the Syrians, who are legally sovereign in Syria, are to be investigated and held accountable by UN monitors, but westerners waging war in Syria, who have no legal standing to wage war there, will not be held accountable, or even investigated.

(A) A deal that gets rid of Assad does not currently look likely (fractured opposition, lack of alternative, Russian support -- at least outwardly), but that may change as events unfold (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria_peace_talks_in_Vienna).

Fellow forecasters, ity is worth keeping in mind that if Assad vacates Damascus for over three weeks, this question will close as YES. As long as warfare constinues within Damascus, I'm keeping the probability high.  OTOH, one of the groups fighting Assad, the Free Syrian Army, is near collapse. On the third hand, rebels are dumpiong the group to join Al Qaeda affiliate Nusra Front. Kurds who were fighting Daesh now are fighting each other. Darn, I need a scorecard just to keep the warlords strait. Meanwhile, Russia fired warning shots at a Turkish fishing boat, generating more news back home to distract Russians from the collapse of the ruble. Aaaannd, more nuclear saber rattling by the guy Obama thought was ready for a reset, the Shirtless One. Just what I didn't want for Christmas. Dateline 12-14-15 Rocket fire and bombs dropped on the Douma neighborhood in eastern Damascus killed 45 people in an attack launched by the Assad regime on Sunday. The attack hit near a primary school, killing its principal and 10 children. The Syrian observatory for Human Rights, a London-based human rights group which monitors reports from the conflict told Agence France Presse that it couldn't tell whether bombs dropped in the attack came from Russian or Syrian aircraft. The U.S.-backed Free Syrian Army is bordering on collapse, according to Stars and Stripes. The paper spoke to rebels with the group, who complained of corrupt leaders skimming from their salaries, exhaustion and factionalism within the ranks. By contrast, one fighter said rebels  are defecting to Islamist groups like the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, which offers better compensation and benefits to its members and has made more progress on the battlefield.

Highlight: no role for Assad or his top lieutenants, which pretty much puts the kibosh on the whole idea of a regime-rebel peace conference right there. Your initial negotiating position should always be more than your willing to settle for, but it can't be that your interlocutor should ultimately give you everything you want and then go away, or put himself at your mercy. This also kind of obviates the possibility of Russia or Iran getting rid of Assad and installing someone else. The Russians and Iranians would have to scour Syria (and Assad's prisons) to find a Syrian Konrad Adenauer, and even assuming such a person exists, he would have to be accepted by the regime supporters and the rebels. The reports out of Riyadh make it clear that the rebels are not fighting Assad personally, but the regime. They would consider the replacement of Assad strictly a cosmetic change. So the presence of Assad is not the impediment to peace, and never has been. The impediment to peace is that the factions in Syria have incompatible visions that do not lend themselves to a negotiated settlement. Even if Assad were eliminated, the regime would survive. Even if the regime were eliminated, the incompatible aims of the remaining factions would still not be reconciled. One faction, Ahrar al-Sham, walked out of the talks. It remains to be seen if they will sign on to the rebel negotiating position in the end, and if  abandoning the talks is just a negotiating tactic of its own. Initially, the talks were scheduled to continue until Friday, so Ahrar al-Sham may still attend if there is a session. But the walkout does demonstrate that there is no \"rebel movement.\" There are disparate groups with specific goals and agendas, and they are not fighting in order to compromise, they are fighting to attain power.  Assad may cease to be President of Syria within the time frame of the question. But the most likely scenario that will close the question as a \"Yes\" will be rebel military action that forces Assad to retreat from Damascus to his coastal redoubt in Latakia.

I think the most significant thing about this raid is the expectation by some people in the west that air campaigns, and wars in general, be carried out with no civilian casualties. Here's the Guardian's coverage of another raid: http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/07/syrian-civilians-killed-us-airstrike And there's the story from last month about warning the drivers of trucks carrying ISIS oil that their trucks were about to be bombed. http://www.snopes.com/2015/11/23/obama-dropped-leaflets-warning-isis-airstrikes/ http://www.military.com/daily-news/2015/11/19/us-choice-to-drop-leaflets-in-syria-contrasts-russian-way-war.html The spokesman in the Military.com article criticizes the Russian tactics of massive strikes with \"dumb bombs,\" and I'm sure is point is well taken. But what he does not address is a) whether the truckers actually left or b) would it have made a difference? Would the strike have been cancelled if they had remained in place? In other words, was the warning Kabuki to get the U.S. off the hook for civilian casualties, or, if it was sincere, could ISIS have called the U.S. bluff? I don't think the coalition air campaign can survive very many strikes that inflict (or appear to inflict) high numbers of civilian casualties; the press, NGOs, and some politicians will demand that the campaign end, or be so curtailed as to be useless. Therefore, the regime will blame the coalition for any air strike that inflicts civilian casualties, and ISIS will do its utmost to insure civilian casualties, so as to discredit the coalition, or perhaps preempt strikes altogether just by presenting the risk. I consider it unlikely that the coalition air campaign will make any difference one way or the other. It may continue for a long time, but will be hampered by its own rules of engagement, and ISIS and regime exploitation of those rules.

The vote would determine a new parliament, though not necessarily a new president. \"Getting to constitutional talks will be difficult. It implies that Syria's warring parties first reach a cease-fire and establish a transition government \u2014 something unattainable so far. Neither Syria's government nor its fractured opposition has endorsed the strategy yet or done much to advance it. \"Nothing can start before defeating the terrorists who occupy parts of Syria,\" Assad recently told Italian state television. Assad considers anyone fighting him, including moderate rebels, to be terrorists. \"Obama countered: \"I do not foresee a situation in which we can end the civil war in Syria while Assad remains in power. ... Even if I said that was OK, I still don't think it would actually work. You could not get the Syrian people, the majority of them, to agree to that kind of outcome. And you couldn't get a number of their neighbors to agree to that outcome, as well.\"\n. . . \n\" . . .  Unlike IS, Assad has powerful patrons in Moscow and Tehran. Russian airstrikes since September have helped stiffen the Syrian government's defenses, while Iranian forces and proxy Hezbollah militants have added muscle to its ground operations.\n. . . \n\"The Nov. 14 statement from the Vienna talks, involving the U.S., Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iran and more than a dozen other governments, . . . does not outline which opposition groups can negotiate with Assad and which are considered terrorist groups. Assad isn't even mentioned.. . .  By itself, the plan offers no clear path for Assad's departure, raising the prospect of the embattled Syrian leader still in office when Obama's presidency ends on Jan. 20, 2017. \"Western diplomats described a poker game being played between the U.S. and its own allies. U.S. officials said that while they accept the idea that Assad won't leave office immediately, the plan for his exit will have to be clarified as part of the diplomatic process. \"Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey are being counted on to persuade the Syrian opposition to support the plan, but will only do so if they get a guarantee on Assad. The U.S. and its European partners cannot offer that guarantee, according to the diplomats, who were not authorized to discuss the talks publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. \"If the opposition rejects talking, Assad will not resign as a result. The rebels would not gain sufficient strength to defeat him on the battlefield, and Russia and Iran would not stop supporting him. \"Even if the plan is accepted by all and works to the best of expectations, Assad would be appear locked in for a transition process that could extend deep into 2017 or longer.If after 18 months or two years, IS is defeated and calm is restored, opposition groups would risk reigniting Syria's conflict by reasserting demands for Assad's ouster. World and regional powers would face the same quandary. For these reasons, some Western diplomats have begun talking about the possibility of Assad staying on indefinitely as a ceremonial president, though stripped of his control over the nation's security and intelligence apparatuses. It's unclear whether any of the sides in the fighting would see that as an acceptable compromise.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  This analysis ignores military action.

NATO announced that it would hold an emergency meeting on Tuesday in Brussels to discuss the episode, as credible reports were emerging from Latakia Province, where the Russian jet went down, that rebels possibly wielding TOW antitank missiles and other weapons had shot down a Russian helicopter sent to the scene of the crash to look for survivors. In his first remarks on the incident, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia confirmed that an F-16 Turkish fighter jet had shot down the Russian plane, a Sukhoi Su-24, with an air-to-air missile. But he insisted that the Russian jet had been in Syrian airspace at the time. - NYT 24NOV15"], [484, "2015-11-24T18:01:35Z", [1.0], "Interesting perspective: http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2015/11/24/457220948/why-would-turkey-shoot-down-a-russian-plane"], [43, "2015-11-24T16:11:58Z", [0.72], "Good news for Assad: It looks like the Kurdish Peshmerga, Shi\u2019ite militia Hashd al-Shaabi, the official Iraqi army, and other Iraqi forces including Sunni tribes may be uniting to continue their successes against Daesh.

Bad news for Assad: Turkey just shot down a Russian warplane for straying into its airspace. Is a NATO Article 5 next? How Daesh's problems help Assad: None of these anti-Daesh Iraqi forces have any desire to take over Damascus. Peshmerga intend to solidify control over northern Syria, but will not move into areas not inhabited by Kurds. Daesh, OTOH, would like to take over as much territory as then can seize, including Damascus. So any losses by Daesh to forces that are agnostic on the question of Assad in power are good news for him. How Russia's conflict with Turkey hurts Assad: Arguably the only thing keeping him in power now is Russian airstrikes. Already Russia has had problems keeping its aircraft operational due to the environment of abrasive dust and sand. Meanwhile, Russia has stepped up attacks in Ukraine around the remnants of the Donetsk airport, and the EU just renewed its sanctions against Russia.

Russia has been making ever-so-tentative signals that it might be willing to make some real concessions to end the war, maybe even help to nudge out Assad. This incident, then, could lead Russia to conclude that its Syria involvement is getting too costly. While Russian leaders don't really, as a rule, admit mistakes \u2014 that's not how they teach it in the Moscow school of diplomacy, as I heard one senior US official put it \u2014 there are indications that it was beginning to see its Syria intervention as a mistake. A number of Russians have reportedly died in the fighting, and they don't have much to show for it. In October, Russian and Iranian forces helped Assad's army launch a big military campaign to retake territory from the rebels \u2014 and it largely failed. Russia's Syria intervention is unpopular at home, and Putin is extremely sensitive to public opinion. A September poll by Moscow's Levada Center found that only 39 percent of respondents said they supported Russia's policy toward the Assad regime. When asked what Russia should do for Assad, 69 percent opposed direct military intervention. A tiny 14 percent of respondents said that Russia should send troops or other direct military support to Syria. That's a pretty sharp contrast to Russia's policy toward Ukraine, which has been enormously popular with Russians. Putin's first, second, and third concerns have always been to maintain his own rule at home. With the economy in shambles, public opinion is crucial for that. Now that footage is emerging of a dead Russian pilot, Russian public opinion could become even more skeptical of the Syria intervention. And Putin will likely respond to that. At the same time, this could lead Putin to harden his position on Syria \u2014 to seek to raise the stakes and make this about avenging Russian honor as a means to shore up public support for the war. That's probably not the most likely outcome, but it is a possibility. \\\\\\\\\\"], [11924, "2015-11-24T15:10:19Z", [0.25], ""], [691, "2015-11-24T14:14:50Z", [0.66], ""], [11246, "2015-11-24T12:06:19Z", [0.45], ""], [11246, "2015-11-24T12:05:59Z", [0.0], "45"], [1587, "2015-11-24T11:47:54Z", [0.1], ""], [1708, "2015-11-24T11:39:46Z", [0.65], "Downing of Russian jet may lead to further NATO-Russia diversion in Syria and a hardening of Russia's support for Assad...although upcoming Hollande visit to Moscow may alleviate repercussions of jet downing\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/25/world/europe/turkey-syria-russia-military-plane.html?ref=world"], [11868, "2015-11-24T04:23:21Z", [0.75], ""], [9682, "2015-11-23T23:23:36Z", [0.1], "Various factors are cementing him in there, most of all Russia/Putin."], [498, "2015-11-23T22:56:19Z", [0.05], ""], [1201, "2015-11-23T22:39:04Z", [0.2], " If Assad were to go right now, what would happen?

In a related move, President Obama said early Wednesday that he was open to cooperating with Russia in the campaign against the Islamic State, which has asserted responsibility for destroying the charter plane and for the deadly attacks in Paris on Friday, but only if the government of President Vladimir V.

During the course of the air strikes, Russia has been using Tu-160 supersonic bombers and Tu-95 propeller strategic bombers which fired 34 rockets to the objects in the Aleppo and Idlib provinces. These strategic bombers were designed in the Soviet Union in the 1950s and 1980s and haven't been part of any conflict before, RIA Novosti reported. Also on Tuesday, Russia used 12 Tu-22M3 strategic bombers in the Raqqua and Deir ez-Zor provinces. These bombers participated in the Soviet Union campaign in Afghanistan in the 1980s and, according to some reports, in the war in South Ossetia in 2008.

Small wonder.  From wikipedia:  \"During the Syrian Civil War, the Alawites have suffered as a result of their support for the Assad government, . . .  with up to a third of young Alawite men killed in the increasingly sectarian conflict. Many Alawites fear a negative outcome for the government in the conflict would result in an existential threat to their community.\"  Between Putin's weak support and the even weaker state of the army, I think Assad is in a very precarious position.  Isn't the situation ripe for a coup? Also, I've been thinking about what cmeinel has called our attention to about the resolution criteria for this question (Assad flees Damascus for 3 weeks), and I've been wondering about how much of a battle anybody would put up for Assad in Damascus.

As the BBC article points out, much of it is just a retread of the Geneva communique of three years ago. The BBC piece also details many of the obstacles to any peace plan. I consider the Russian proposal to be so much boilerplate. None of it has any immediate significance, nor is it intended to. In my opinion, Russia's proposal, and all Russian public statements so far, have two specific goals: first, to delegitimize any rebel groups that Russia wants to marginalize, perhaps giving Russia a chance to co-opt some rebel groups, and second, to legitimize the idea of Assad remaining in power, even if that power is tightly constrained. There are quite a few questions that are not clear when taking about Russia's moves in Syria. For example, does Russia consider the reconstitution of Syria feasible? If so, does Russia consider it desirable? I think the answer to the first question is \"probably not,\" and the answer to the second is, \"yes, but conditionally.\" They are interested in their strategic goals, which they will pursue with or without Assad. If it is advantageous to get rid of him, they will do so, or try to. But so far nothing I have read here or elsewhere has made any kind of case that the Russians consider it to their advantage to get rid of Assad at this time. That may change, but so far there is nothing on the horizon to think that it will. The Russians know that their best hope of permanently securing bases on the Mediterranean coast is for Assad to retain control of Latakia, at the very least. There is so far no one to replace him. It is unlikely that the rebels will come up with any alternative. There may be candidates within Assad's ruling circle, but installing such a person is a risk. Why would Assad's coalition accept such a move? What if they didn't? Who do the Russians back then? What do they do? Send more troops? Pull out, having accomplished nothing? For now, Assad is the path of least resistance, and he will be for the foreseeable future.

He was pressing for details on a possible shift of strategy away from taking down Assad, the prior held strategy. Not one administration representative would answer, because if they did confirm that the fight to remove Assad remains the objective, Graham would have teed up his sound bite, \"in which case we are going to war with Russia and Iran by proxy in Syria\".

In this scenario, Assad remains in power until a negotiated settlement with opposition forces is reached.

Of course, many questions and challenges remain. For one thing, a negotiated settlement implies a cessation of violence. It is not necessary for all fighting to stop \u2013 as ISIS will likely never agree to any settlement. However, a cessation of violence between Syrian opposition forces and Assad\u2019s military is required. The next question is who is doing the negotiating on behalf of rebel forces?

Neither one of them is supporting him as a favor to him. They are doing it because the consider it to be to their advantage. Iran wants hegemony over as much of the Middle East as it can get, and Russia wants the ability to project power into the eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East. It's worth noting that the objectives of Russia and Iran are not really compatible, but they'll both worry about that later. From the article linked by @einsteinjs below: 'A senior official from the Middle East familiar with the Iranian position suggested Iran might go as far as ending support for Assad after the transition period. \"Talks are all about compromises and Iran is ready to make a compromise by accepting Assad remaining for six months,\" the official told Reuters. \"Of course, it will be up to the Syrian people to decide about the country's fate.\"' The \"senior official\" is obviously Iranian, because no allies of Iran were present at the Vienna meeting, and the quote is presented as authoritative. The important thing about this statement is that it's circular. Assad has to leave after a transition. But the country's fate is up to the \"Syrian people,\" and if the \"Syrian people\" (whoever they are defined to be) want Assad to stick around in some capacity, he won't have to leave after the transition, because that's not the will of the Syrian people. As it is presented in the article, the statement is meaningless; it says two mutually exclusive things, with neither being defined as outweighing the other. I think there has developed in recent decades a great gap between the way the west looks at negotiations, and the way other cultures (including Russia) do. The west negotiates to reach a compromise, other powers negotiate to get what they want. To the west, negotiation is worthwhile in itself, to Iran or Russia, negotiation is worthwhile only so far as it advances specific policies that the leaders have agreed upon. I don't think that the public statements of Russia or Iran - especially  about Assad leaving after a transition - can be taken at face value. They know how westerners talk, and they're perfectly happy to talk that way in public. When it comes to actually making a deal, they will drive a much harder bargain.

I agree with Secretary Kerry that Russia and the U.S. do have  a lot of common ground. The important part of the article comes at the very end: '\u201cRussia and the US share an amazing amount of common ground,\u201d Kerry said. He noted that both sides agree on the need for a political solution; that victory by IS has to be prevented; on the imperative to save the state of Syria and its institutions; to preserve a united and secular Syria; and to create conditions for the return of displaced persons and refugees. \"We agree on the right of the Syrian people to choose their leadership through transparent, free, and fair elections with a new constitution and protections for all minorities in the country,\" Kerry added.' So: \"both sides agree on the need for a political solution; that victory by IS has to be prevented.\" Every other condition Kerry specifies is unworkable and no longer on the table. Syria will never be reconstituted in its current form. The best they can do is a cobble together a loose federation of cantons that will be called \"Syria,\" have embassies around the world, and be accredited to international organizations. Saving Syrian institutions under a unified secular government is never going to happen. When Kerry, or anybody else, talks about \"the Syrian people\" choosing their leaders, it simply postpones the essential question of who \"the Syrian people\" actually are. By comparison, who are the \"Lebanese people?\" Maronites, Druze, Shi'ites, Sunnis, etc. as groups? Are they one nation? They don't seem to think so. So who are the \"Syrians,\" and what form will their \"choice\" take? One person, one vote, or a divvying up of power among groups? Probably the latter, since the \"protection of minorities\" (including Alawites!) is specifically mentioned as a condition. So where does that leave us? With a political solution that prevents an ISIS victory. That's the only thing everybody can agree on, and in order to implement it, you have to go to the lowest common denominator. The lowest common denominator is that all the factions hammer out an agreement delineating their respective turf, stop fighting each other, and together turn on ISIS.

Assad says he won't consider such a deal until \"terrorism is eradicated,\" but then Assad is the one who decides when that condition is fulfilled, so he can change his mind about an FSA alliance at any time. The second thing is the mention of Russian air power pounding rebel positions in central Hama (by which they mean Hama province; Hama city is held by Assad). The direct route to Aleppo from regime-held territory is through rebel-held areas of Hama province and Idlib province. @mike97mike is right about the importance of Safira to continued regime presence in Aleppo. The other areas cut off by ISIS are not contiguous with ISIS territory, and from the map look like that can be retaken by the regime fairly soon. Safira is different, because it is not isolated from ISIS-controlled territory, and ISIS troops can be reinforced and supplied there, although they are still vulnerable to air strikes. If Safira falls, I doubt if there will be a Stalingrad-style surrender of Assad troops in Aleppo. I assume they will be able to withdraw to positions south of Safira, and ISIS will not have the strength to destroy them. In my opinion the fall of Safira to ISIS, even if it happens, does the rebels no good. It just means that the rebels will be ISIS' sole opponent in the Aleppo area. Every advance by ISIS increases the danger to every adversary ISIS has. When ISIS has finished its offensive against opponent A, it launches an offensive against opponent B. When opponents A and B fight each other, ISIS moves in to any weak point it can exploit. I think it is reaching a point where at least some opposition groups might be willing to temporarily align with Assad against the threat of ISIS.  If such an alignment were to happen, it might permit the regime to open a western supply line from Hama to Aleppo, making Safira less vital. If the rebels reject the proposal, the Russians and the regime will spare no effort to open such a supply line anyway, probably in conjunction with a push toward Idlib, which started last month but may have stalled - in any case it's isn't in the news anymore. I agree with everyone that this battle is important, but I disagree with much of the commentary about what it means. I don't think that a withdrawal from Aleppo would mean the end of the regime, although it would obviously be a serious loss. But I might add that if the regime holds on in Safira, I think it has a pretty good chance of retaking Aleppo, or at least surrounding it.

Given this setback and the coming storm in the east, I believe Russia will find a need for a new leader or sink with al-Assad.  The Syrian Civil War will be won on the battlefield.  I will revisit this prediction after the Battle of al-Safira...  Get you battlefield maps at the ready.  \"So far, the group [IS] has gained control of approximately 10 loyalist checkpoints along the crucial supply line running from Hama through Salamiyeh, Ithriyah and Khanaser to Aleppo. Damascus and its allies have been forced to temporarily halt most of their offensive operations in Aleppo province as they scramble to secure the threatened corridor. The situation, already troubling for Syrian President Bashar al Assad, has only worsened with the rumors of the Islamic State's advances in al-Safira. If true, the group's latest push could threaten to cut supplies off from the large number of loyalist troops in Aleppo province. Though the troops could still receive deliveries flown in by aircraft, the loss of overland supply routes would be a heavy blow. The Islamic State's advances also highlight a broader reality of the Syrian civil war: As the rebels and loyalists continue to devote the bulk of their resources to fighting each other, the Islamic State will have the chance to take advantage of weaknesses in both fronts. For instance, in the initial stages of the Syrian government's latest offensive campaign, rebel forces weakened their lines of contact with the Islamic State to send reinforcements to Hama, Idlib and southern Aleppo. This decision enabled the Islamic State to push forward and take considerable territory in northern Aleppo province. Similarly, loyalist troops have focused the bulk of their attention on launching offensive operations against the country's rebels, giving the Islamic State the opportunity to advance against weakly held loyalist positions. Ultimately, al Assad's troops cannot allow their only supply line into Aleppo province to be closed off. If they did, they would risk the gradual weakening of their northern forces, dooming hopes of turning the tide of battle in their favor with the intervention of Russian troops. Their push to relieve besieged loyalist forces in Kweiris air base would also become much less significant if those troops were to be besieged once again within a larger loyalist pocket. Thus, reopening the supply lines into Aleppo will likely become the government's highest priority. Whether it is able to reopen those lines within a few days or its efforts stall in the face of the Islamic State's determined resistance will make the difference between temporary setback and potential catastrophe.\" - Stratfor  27OCT15"], [1253, "2015-10-28T04:28:12Z", [0.37], ""], [10124, "2015-10-28T03:53:38Z", [0.75], ""], [689, "2015-10-28T03:07:31Z", [0.76], ""], [40, "2015-10-28T02:47:18Z", [0.56], "THE HORROR!

Syrian President Bashar al Assad told Russian lawmakers in Damascus on Oct. 25 that he was ready to take part in a presidential election if the Syrian people support the idea, RIA news agency reported. Al Assad had also expressed a willingness to discuss amendments to Syria's constitution and parliamentary elections. Moscow is a key foreign ally for al Assad, and Russia's foreign minister said on Oct. 24 that the Kremlin wanted Syria to prepare for parliamentary and presidential elections. Russia would like the Syrian government to hold presidential and parliamentary elections soon, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Oct. 24 on state television, Reuters reported. Lavrov added that Russia is prepared to give air support to Free Syrian Army units against the Islamic State but needed U.S. help identifying appropriate rebel partners. Russian leaders met with U.S. leaders in Vienna on Oct. 23 and said that Syria must decide on a plan for their country without outside meddling. Russian planes began carrying out airstrikes Sept. 30 in support of the government of President Bashar al Assad. Islamic State militants took control of the main supply line into loyalist-held areas of Aleppo on Oct. 24, according to Islamic State sources, Reuters reported. The assault began Oct. 23 southeast of the city, with militants setting off two car bombs. Syrian state media and officials have not commented. Troops loyal to Syrian President Bashar al Assad have been advancing toward the Kweiras air base with the help of Russian airstrikes to break and Islamic State siege. The Islamic State attack appears to respond to this push. Related new, Iraq's invites Russian bombing campaign against the Islamic State in Iraq. More bombers; more funding for Russian military.

This would have the dual effect of legitimizing Russia's geopolitical strategy in the area, (Russia's critics would be largely appeased, since the general sentiment in the world, towards Russia, would be \"Russia did what the US had been trying to do for years yet had failed to do: eradicate ISIS AND affect regime change\") and giving their military presence and campaign in Syria geopolitical clout.  It is unlikely, though, that Russia would support an election to find a replacement, and is instead more likely to support an presidentially-appointed successor to Assad.  In this scenario, Russia would/could convince Assad that resignation in this manner was in his best interest, as it would allow Assad to live a relatively comfortable life post-Presidency, free from being pursued for criminal charges by the ICC, and such a move would give Russia the political capital to play a big role in the choosing of a replacement to Assad, primarily, one who is largely pro-Russian, something which would be vital to Russia's geopolitical strategy.   So while Russia does want President Assad to stay in power, Russia is incredibly forward-thinking, and, as it applies to Bashar al-Assad in Syria, may already see the writing on the wall: eventually, Assad has got to go.  There is just no place for him in this increasingly-connected, cooperational, and peaceful world.  Knowing this, Russia may well decide to get ahead of the curve, and actually push for regime change in Syria.  However, that regime would necessarily need to be as \"pro-Russian\" as Assad is, if not more so, for Russia to support it, and that means that Russia cannot afford to risk that the regime change in question would come about through an election.   Therefore, it is far more likely that Assad will NOT cease to be President of Syria by 1 March, 2017.  Objectively, Russia is better off with Assad in power than any other potential political solution, but the Syria civil war has been going on for over 4 years now, and every day that it continues, a future with Assad in power becomes less-and-less likely.

Putin, the Russian president, sounded dismissive of Syria\u2019s beleaguered leader, Bashar al-Assad, and unconcerned about his future.

Putin  . . . met in Moscow on Tuesday to discuss the military operations in Syria. . . . By all accounts, the two leaders remain distant and wary of each other. The Kremlin in particular has been frustrated by what it sees as Mr. Assad\u2019s arrogance and, at least until recently, his unwillingness to bend to Russia\u2019s wishes, on issues like jump-starting peace talks in Moscow this year and freeing dissidents who might play a role in any political solution. \". . .   \u201cTo them, Assad is not a sacred cow,\u201d Mr. Trenin [the director of the Carnegie Moscow Center said]. \u201cThe issue to them is to save the Syrian state, to prevent it from unraveling the way Libya unraveled, Yemen unraveled.\u201d\n. . . \n\"That has given hope to those who want to see a negotiated end to the war in Syria and hasten the departure of Mr. Assad himself \u2014 something Mr. Putin has signaled he is prepared to accept, even as Russia has continued to lend diplomatic and now direct military action to support Mr. Assad\u2019s government. \"Others, though, remain skeptical.  \u201cNot being wedded to Assad does not mean that they\u2019re prepared to negotiate a way for him to go,\u201d said a senior administration official in Washington . . . .\n. . . \n\u201cThere\u2019s not much chemistry in the relationship,\u201d said one long-serving Western diplomat in the region.\n. . . \n\u201cIt is now an alliance, and a fighting one,\u201d Mr. Trenin said. \u201cStill, it remains essentially transactional, rather than values-based or strategic.\u201d \"Mr. Putin\u2019s primary goal in Syria, as he laid it out in remarks at the United Nations last month, has been to prevent the toppling of another sovereign state in the Middle East by what he considers foreign interference, led by the United States. A secondary purpose, though, has been to reassert Russia\u2019s re-emergence as a crucial player in the Middle East and beyond, forcing through military action an easing of the diplomatic isolation imposed on Mr. Putin after events in Ukraine. . . .  \"In brief remarks . . . released . . . after Mr. Assad\u2019s departure, . . .  [Putin & Assad] said that a political solution was only possible after success on the battlefield, which neither defined, leaving the timing of any negotiations entirely unclear. \"The question now is whether Mr. Putin can press Mr. Assad to accept a negotiated end to his rule. \u201cPutin\u2019s influence over Assad is like Obama\u2019s over Netanyahu,\u201d a diplomat based in Syria told a group of colleagues several months ago, before the Russian military intervention began . . . . \"Mr. Assad has, in fact, proved at times to be a reluctant partner in Russia\u2019s efforts to end the conflict. He has stood up on many occasions to the Kremlin, to the extent that diplomats and analysts say it has irritated Mr. Putin. \u201cI think they know how confused the Assad regime is, and they\u2019re frustrated by it,\u201d said Andrew J. Tabler, an expert on Syria at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy who has followed the conflict closely, referring to the Russians. He and others noted Russia\u2019s efforts in January and April to broker talks in Moscow between Mr. Assad\u2019s government and some of the armed groups rebelling against it.  . . .  Mr. Assad\u2019s representative, Bashar al-Jaafari, showed little flexibility in those talks, refusing to agree to confidence-building measures Moscow wanted, such as releasing political prisoners who might take part in a political solution.\n. . . \n\" . . .  Mr. Putin summoned Syria\u2019s foreign minister, Walid al-Moallem, to Moscow in late June, for a meeting that was described as tense. It was then, evidently, that Mr. Putin began laying the groundwork for the military intervention. That appears to have given him far more leverage over Mr. Assad, something analysts said could weaken Mr. Assad\u2019s standing at home by emphasizing his junior status to Mr. Putin. \"Officials in Europe and the United States have warned that Russia\u2019s intervention makes a political resolution even more remote. Whatever Mr. Putin\u2019s personal feelings for the Syrian leader, he has made it clear that Russia\u2019s immediate goal is shoring up the central government; he has yet to signal what might follow. \"The Kremlin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitri S.

The first story concerns ISIS and the anti-Assad rebels fighting for control of the supply route from Turkey. Since the story was written there has been a third contender for control, namely regime forces along with Iran/Hezbollah troops, with the support of Russian air power. The second story presents Assad as being willing to compromise with \"some\" rebels. I think tomorrow's meeting will involve an offer by Putin to guarantee some concessions to Saudi and Turkish backed rebels in exchange for some indication that everyone accepts that Assad can stick around until some unspecified time in he future. Putin's threat is that the offensive against the northern supply route will continue, and almost certainly succeed, and the non-ISIS rebels will be defeated anyway. Thus if the rebels don't align with Assad, they will be cut off, and left to be destroyed by ISIS - not destroyed by Assad - the more horrific the retaliation against the rebels, the better for him. Saudi Arabia and Turkey are important because SA is the financier (with others) of the supplies, and Turkey is the conduit. The rebels are pretty much stuck with any deal those two powers make on their behalf, or at their expense. I think there are two things going on here. First, Russia has elbowed Iran out of the dominant position as Assad's sponsor - which Assad is perfectly fine with for now. Second, Putin and Assad are offering Syria (and the world) two options, and only two: Assad or ISIS.  As to the ultimate fate of Assad, I think he and Putin both think that he may be able to hold on forever if some compromise is reached soon with some rebel factions. I note something specific from this story about Turkey linked yesterday by REGallahue: http://news.yahoo.com/turkey-ready-accept-six-month-transition-period-syrias-132858752.html;_ylt=AwrC0CMa2SdWqwUA6hDQtDMD;_ylu=X3oDMTByNXQ0NThjBGNvbG8DYmYxBHBvcwM1BHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg-- It states that the Turks might be content for Assad to continue in office for six months during a transition, but that there is no agreement as to when the six months might begin.

The deal that will be negotiated will be for Assad to grant the support of his political connections to a candidate approved by Moscow. In return, Assad gets a safe flight and comfortable retirement with no possibility of war crimes prosecution. I imagine similar arrangements for his family members will be made.  2. Russia wants a secular Syria because a secular Syria can be bought. I wouldn't go so far as to call it a puppet state, but whatever emerges from this agreement/transition will be very interested in supporting Russia's interests in the region.  3. When?

The threat of terrorism, he said, \"obstructs\" any political solution to the crisis.\n. . . \n\"The Russian leader \"needs a quick result after which he can announce a Russian military success,\" said Trenin, suggesting Russia would then put \"the burden of the war\" on Iran and Hezbollah.\n\"For Putin, it's important now to act not only as a military victor but as a political peacekeeper as well,\" Trenin said. \"Putin is perfectly aware of the fact that Assad is going to have to hand over power or divide it. The Syria that existed before 2011 cannot be restored.\" \"Others, however, said that in welcoming Assad, Putin was signaling that Russia would be uncompromising about Assad staying in power. \"It's a serious statement meaning that Russia will continue to support Assad to the bitter end,\" said Pavel Felgenhauer, an independent Russian military analyst. \"There will be no political settlement in the sense that the West sees it. The opposition must surrender and stop fighting Assad and join him, and that is going to be the political solution.\" \"Commentators on Syrian TV hailed the visit as an endorsement of Assad's legitimacy, reinforcing the notion that he must be part of a future political solution to the crisis.\n. . . \nSince June, Russia has played with the idea of a political transition that would envisage setting up some sort of interim government, and has discussed the issue with the U.S., Saudi Arabia, the Syrian opposition and others. \"Moscow's diplomatic efforts have brought no visible results so far, though Putin has insisted that a political solution for Syria remains his top goal despite Russia's military action. He recently met with Saudi officials, staunch critics of Assad and supporters of the rebels fighting against him. After Tuesday's meeting with Assad, he called the Saudi king to brief him about the talks before the foreign ministers' meeting in Vienna on Friday. \"Moscow also has sought to alleviate the concerns of Turkey, a major economic partner and the second-biggest importer of Russian natural gas, which has been critical of Russia's intervention in Syria. Ankara also supports rebels fighting Assad.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  I think it's significant that there will be a meeting of the FMs from the US, SA, Turkey & Russia.  3 of those 4 want Assad gone.

When Assad calls for a comprehensive peace including all the ethnic and religious groups in Syria, we have to remember that he's from a minority himself. I think what he's doing is offering himself as an anti-ISIS rallying point. If you are a Christian, Druze, or Shiite, or even a Sunni who dreads rule by ISIS, Assad starts to look pretty good. I don't consider his statements an offer to step down, or for a \"transition\" (which the NYT called it, not Assad). It's an offer by Putin to combat ISIS, on the condition that Assad stays in power. I doubt if the Russia-Saudi Arabia-Turkey meeting will discuss replacing Assad. It will probably entail a proposal by Russia for all factions in Syria, and their sponsors, to unite against ISIS.  Assad didn't go to Moscow for a trivial reason, as many forecasters have observed. But he didn't go to discuss his own deposition, assassination or exile either. I don't think the Afghanistan precedent holds here. An important distinction is that there was an alternative in Afghanistan in 1979. For now, there is no apparent alternative in Syria.

That's not Turkey.  That's not Russia.  That's the \"legal\" President of Syria talking about a political transition in Syria. I don't think he is talking about  a political transition to more al-Assad, either.  That's not a transition.

Washington had shelved a program to train and equip \"moderate\" rebels opposed to President Bashar al Assad who would join the fight against the Islamic State. Only the Kurdish People's Protection Units have had success against the militant group while cooperating with the U.S.-led coalition, so to which units did the parachute drop go to? I have read (al-Monitor, Stratfor, Foreign Policy, al-Jazeera) that during the Grand Prix events recently held in Sochi, Russia (of Winter Olympic fame) short sit-down meetings between Saudi Royalty and Putin representatives were confrontational. What does this mean? The main message Putin wanted to get across was that there would be serious consequences should the Gulf states include man-portable air defense systems in their plans for augmenting rebel support. Russia believes sending SA-22 surface-to-air missiles to Syria to provide air defense for Russian forces in country (never mind that the rebels lack air power) is fair, but \"rebel-sponsors\" putting surface-to-air missiles in their hands willing to shoot down Russian planes is not. This is the same message that the US had issued to the Saudis and other Gulf allies: Surface-to-air missiles are a \"red line.\" The United States learned this lesson the hard way during the Cold War and have expended a lot of time, money and energy already in trying to track down (e.g. Afghanistan, Libya). Whether the Saudis will continue to respect the \"red line\" on man-portable air defense systems, however, remains to be seen. There are already reports that the Saudis are sending an additional 500 TOW missiles to Syria in an effort to blunt the current Russian-led offensive. In other news, the US had agreed to bail our Iraqi budget deficits of $6-7 billion dollars. Funny, after Iraqi alliance with Russia, but part of the the geopolitical wrangling in the area, I guess. And Israel struck southern Syria after rocket- attacks from that regions. Is an Israel intervention in the offing? Unmitigating war does make strange bedfellows. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 12OCT15 Update: Stalled loyalist advance sputters to life, takes village.

That area is vital to Assad's survival. Russian forces carried out airstrikes Oct. 10 across northern and western Syria in a continuation of their ongoing bombing campaign, Reuters reported. The northern airstrikes hit targets in northern Latakia and Hama province, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Strikes in the west were accompanied by loyalist ground assaults and targeted non-Islamic State rebel groups. The Islamic State registered significant gains on Friday in the area of northwestern Syria that Russian warplanes have been bombing, taking six villages near Aleppo and threatening to cut off an important route north to the Turkish border. Late in the day, there were reports that rebels had reasserted control in one village. The Kremlin has said its military had entered Syria to fight the Islamic State, but the Russian forces have concentrated much of their firepower on insurgent groups aligned against President Bashar al-Assad, including the Nusra Front, Al Qaeda\u2019s affiliate in Syria, and relatively secular groups like the Free Syrian Army. Rival insurgents say that the Islamic State, also called ISIS or Daesh, is taking advantage. \u201cDaesh has exploited the Russian airstrikes and the preoccupation of the Free Syrian Army in its battles in Hama, and advanced in Aleppo,\u201d one rebel commander told Reuters. The Islamic State advance is threatening a strategic area north of Aleppo on the way to crossing points into Turkey that was to be part of a proposed ISIS-free buffer zone under a plan the United States announced over the summer with Turkey. That plan now seems to have stalled. => http://nyti.ms/1Lb0CIi\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n09OCT15: BATTLEFIELD MAPS.

It is unclear if the helicopter is Syrian or Russian (hint to observers: look for the Hind \"D\", next time, Russian pilots usually won't fly the export models of the \"flying tank\"). Loyalist troops backed by Russian airstrikes launched an offensive against rebels in the Ghab plain. The operation is meant to reverse rebel gains made over the summer that threaten the coastal region vital to the government of President Bashar al Assad. According to reports, the offensive failed to make significant gains against the rebels. Let' stop right there. Mi Mu-24 helicopters to many of us in the west conjure up so many images! Hollywood (\"Charlie Wilson's War\"), Mujaheddin, the Afghani resistance to Soviet authority, the rise of both CIA involvement in that war supplying Stinger missiles and of our \"ally\" at the time, Osama bin Laden.

So, no. This may be a peaceful end to the effectiveness of that pre-Russia intervention. We're now on to \"loyalists\" and \"rebels\", which reminds us of battlefields in Spain fought out as - in one analysis - the first salvos of of WWII. But history does not repeat itself.

'Proxy war' was the way new media described different periods in the Vietnam War, The Nicaraguan Civil War, etc. during the 70's and 80's to the end of the Cold War. The Syrian army, backed by allied militia, has advanced in western Syria after heavy Russian airstrikes, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Oct. 11, Reuters reported. The monitoring group also said the military took control of Tal Skik, a highland area in Idlib province close to rebel-held positions. The military also destroyed weapons, ammunition and equipment during the operation and 50 enemy fighters were killed in the airstrikes.

That area is vital to Assad's survival. Russian forces carried out airstrikes Oct. 10 across northern and western Syria in a continuation of their ongoing bombing campaign, Reuters reported. The northern airstrikes hit targets in northern Latakia and Hama province, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Strikes in the west were accompanied by loyalist ground assaults and targeted non-Islamic State rebel groups. The Islamic State registered significant gains on Friday in the area of northwestern Syria that Russian warplanes have been bombing, taking six villages near Aleppo and threatening to cut off an important route north to the Turkish border. Late in the day, there were reports that rebels had reasserted control in one village. The Kremlin has said its military had entered Syria to fight the Islamic State, but the Russian forces have concentrated much of their firepower on insurgent groups aligned against President Bashar al-Assad, including the Nusra Front, Al Qaeda\u2019s affiliate in Syria, and relatively secular groups like the Free Syrian Army. Rival insurgents say that the Islamic State, also called ISIS or Daesh, is taking advantage. \u201cDaesh has exploited the Russian airstrikes and the preoccupation of the Free Syrian Army in its battles in Hama, and advanced in Aleppo,\u201d one rebel commander told Reuters. The Islamic State advance is threatening a strategic area north of Aleppo on the way to crossing points into Turkey that was to be part of a proposed ISIS-free buffer zone under a plan the United States announced over the summer with Turkey. That plan now seems to have stalled. => http://nyti.ms/1Lb0CIi\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n09OCT15: BATTLEFIELD MAPS.

The Fall of Two Campaigns - The first offensive stems from Russia and Iran's effort to stabilize Syrian President Bashar al Assad's forces and to restore their advantage on the battlefield. If successful, the effort could put the Syrian government in a much more favorable position at the bargaining table when it comes to discussing a possible negotiated settlement to the conflict.

The fighting, described as the most intense fighting in months, launched around the town of Morek that links Damascus to the northern hub of Aleppo. On Oct. 6, a pro-rebel media outlet reported that Russia had spent the past week establishing a base in southeastern Hama, with the presence of Russian forces expanding noticeably throughout the city. With the help of foreign backers, loyalists and rebels will launch two major advances that will shape the course of the Syrian conflict. The Fall of Two Campaigns - The first offensive stems from Russia and Iran's effort to stabilize Syrian President Bashar al Assad's forces and to restore their advantage on the battlefield. If successful, the effort could put the Syrian government in a much more favorable position at the bargaining table when it comes to discussing a possible negotiated settlement to the conflict. The offensive will target three areas: the northern Homs pocket, the al-Ghab plain and its surrounding mountains in northwest Hama, and the Kweiris air base. The successful eradication of rebel forces in the northern Homs pocket would eliminate a dangerous rebel position close to the critical cities of Homs and Hama while freeing up a large number of loyalist troops for operations elsewhere. Turkey, Jordan, Gulf Arab states and the United States are preparing to bolster the Syrian rebels with further supplies of weaponry and equipment. Most notably, the United States has backed a new push against the Islamic State in Syria that aims to secure the remaining Islamic State-occupied areas on the Syria-Turkey border while threatening the group's de facto capital, Raqqa. Washington insists that these plans have been in the works since before Russia's latest intervention in Syria, but it is clear that Moscow's activities will only provide additional impetus for the U.S.-backed rebel offensive."], [691, "2015-10-07T13:03:39Z", [0.18], ""], [43, "2015-10-07T10:04:38Z", [0.27], "Russian public less than keen about sending ground troops to Syria.

The fact that this hasn't happened says to me that people recognize that Putin is right:  there'd be a leadership vacuum that ISIS would exploit, and   ISIS is the greater enemy. But, in a war zone 17 months is a long, long time.  al-Assad has enemies everywhere, possibly within his own government.

This will not be quiet and will not be quick.\" Boy-howdee! Let's review a few thing that have happen JUST OVER THIS PAST WEEKEND (yes, I'm shouting): (1) Under United Nations supervision, Hezbollah and the government of President Bashar al Assad reached a deal Sept. 24 with Syrian rebels on fighting in Idlib and Rif Dimashq provinces, The Daily Star reported. The agreement will be fulfilled within six months, before which the two sides will observe a local cease-fire. Under the deal, rebel forces will pull out of the city of Zabadani, which is near the Lebanese border in Rif Dimashq province. Rebels will also allow civilians to evacuate from Fuaa and Kafriyeh, two Shiite towns under siege by rebels in Idlib province in the northwest. Both sides will be allowed to remove their wounded from the areas beginning Sept. 25. (2) Iraqi military officials are engaged in intelligence and security cooperation with Russia, Iran, and Syria to counter the Islamic State, the Iraqi military's joint operations command said, Al Jazeera reported Sept. 27. The cooperation comes as Russia steps up its military involvement in Syria, while pressing for Damascus to be included in international efforts to fight the Islamic State. A military-diplomatic source in Moscow also said officers of the four countries would lead a Baghdad coordination center on a rotating basis, starting with Iraq. (3) Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has declared Sept. 28 a national holiday in Iraq and closed the Green Zone, a decision unnamed Iraqi military and intelligence sources say was motivated in anticipation of a possible coup attempt, Gulf Online reported. The prime minister received intelligence indicating that a coup would be led by officers loyal to former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, the sources said. Al-Maliki and other senior Iraqi political figures, lawmakers and ministers have reportedly fled to southern Iraq. A lawmaker with al-Maliki\u2019s Rule of Law coalition denied the reports, Al Sumaria reported. Brushing aside the question of whether the US diplomats were caught \"off-guard\" in Iraq (really, again?), the coalition that Russia is forging is not a surprising alliance of interests. Those interests have been at play in the region for most of the 21st Century. What is surprising is the speed and rapidity of Russian moves in the region, first militarily followed by diplomacy. If a forecaster views these events as independent of, say, the building storm and perhaps attempts at coup in Moldova, Nordstream/Southstream (Anystream?), or the now relative quietude settling over eastern Ukraine, it may appear as the al Assad regime has finally found its long-lost friend who has now come back to bank-roll its survival. Um, yeah. A larger view will see the position Russia, for very little relative commitment, has staked out in the Levant and beyond. In addition, one will notice the change in media attention, and activity on the battlefield. Away from ISIS terror and towards Russian military build-up and Syrian government build-up, and accord-building on a \"final outcome in Syria\". As an example, Russia, the United States, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Egypt will meet in October to discuss the Syrian conflict, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov said, RIA Novosti reported Sept. 28. Others could be invited to the talks, which will include four Syrian working groups and which will take place after the U.N. General Assembly. Of course, armed conflict has its own life. And while a little relative commitment today in aiding \"an old ally and friend\" may garner opportunities for greater political and diplomatic leverage over \"superrivals\", it may turn on a different point. Such moves by superpowers in close military proximity are historically these type turning points. Enough said. Oh yes, forecast up to 76%."], [2723, "2015-09-28T15:19:56Z", [0.07], "Right now it looks as if Asad will cease being president if he dies of natural causes or an assassin gets lucky.

How likely is this now? I don't know whether the Sunni jihadis have got the capability to defeat Asad's forces and storm a key city like Damascus. A feature of Arab civil wars is that they tend towards stalemate and de facto political division rather than outright victory for one side or the other. 2) An internal coup - this would almost certainly precipitate the government's collapse so government supporters don't look to have much choice but to hang together.  3) Asad voluntarily leaving as a result of an international peace agreement. Even Philip Hammond's given up on this one. There's some curveballs: Sunni mass graves, chemical weapons, a Turkish invasion of the Kurdish fiefdoms.

Source: Dateline 9-14-15 A coalition of rebel groups in Syria has seized territory in the mountains east of Latakia, near the hometown of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, according to Reuters. The coalition includes al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate, the Nusra Front, and fighters from the Islamic State. The advance threatens the heartland of Syria's Alawite minority, which forms a core pillar of support for Assad.

Suspecting larger forces would array over 2 weeks ago I observed, \"...the fresh involvement of Russia in arming and aiding the al-Assad regime underscores the key players actively pursuing their interests in the region. This will not be quiet and will not be quick.\"  Boy-howdee!  Let's review a few thing that have happen JUST OVER THIS PAST WEEKEND (yes, I'm shouting): (1) Under United Nations supervision, Hezbollah and the government of President Bashar al Assad reached a deal Sept. 24 with Syrian rebels on fighting in Idlib and Rif Dimashq provinces, The Daily Star reported. The agreement will be fulfilled within six months, before which the two sides will observe a local cease-fire. Under the deal, rebel forces will pull out of the city of Zabadani, which is near the Lebanese border in Rif Dimashq province. Rebels will also allow civilians to evacuate from Fuaa and Kafriyeh, two Shiite towns under siege by rebels in Idlib province in the northwest. Both sides will be allowed to remove their wounded from the areas beginning Sept. 25. (2) Iraqi military officials are engaged in intelligence and security cooperation with Russia, Iran, and Syria to counter the Islamic State, the Iraqi military's joint operations command said, Al Jazeera reported Sept. 27. The cooperation comes as Russia steps up its military involvement in Syria, while pressing for Damascus to be included in international efforts to fight the Islamic State. A military-diplomatic source in Moscow also said officers of the four countries would lead a Baghdad coordination center on a rotating basis, starting with Iraq. (3) Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has declared Sept. 28 a national holiday in Iraq and closed the Green Zone, a decision unnamed Iraqi military and intelligence sources say was motivated in anticipation of a possible coup attempt, Gulf Online reported. The prime minister received intelligence indicating that a coup would be led by officers loyal to former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, the sources said. Al-Maliki and other senior Iraqi political figures, lawmakers and ministers have reportedly fled to southern Iraq. A lawmaker with al-Maliki\u2019s Rule of Law coalition denied the reports, Al Sumaria reported. Brushing aside the question of whether the US diplomats were caught \"off-guard\" in Iraq (really, again?), the coalition that Russia is forging is not a surprising alliance of interests.  Those interests have been at play in the region for most of the 21st Century.  What is surprising is the speed and rapidity of Russian moves in the region, first militarily followed by diplomacy. If a forecaster views these events as independent of, say, the building storm and perhaps attempts at coup in Moldova, Nordstream/Southstream (Anystream?), or the now relative quietude settling over eastern Ukraine, it may appear as the al Assad regime has finally found its long-lost friend who has now come back to bank-roll its survival.  Um, yeah.  A larger view will see the position Russia, for very little relative commitment, has staked out in the Levant and beyond. In addition, one will notice the change in media attention, and activity on the battlefield.  Away from ISIS terror and towards Russian military build-up and Syrian government build-up, and accord-building on a \"final outcome in Syria\".   As an example, Russia, the United States, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Egypt will meet in October to discuss the Syrian conflict, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov said, RIA Novosti reported Sept. 28. Others could be invited to the talks, which will include four Syrian working groups and which will take place after the U.N. General Assembly. Of course, armed conflict has its own life.  And while a little relative commitment today in aiding \"an old ally and friend\" may garner opportunities for greater political and diplomatic leverage over \"superrivals\", it may turn on a different point.  Such moves by superpowers in close military proximity are historically  these type turning points. Enough said. Oh yes, forecast up to 76%.  This is a tough question. 1 March, 2017. Really?  The resolution is dictated by independent dynamics of war, not politics or diplomacy. The al-Assad regime is the longest lasting secular regime in the Arab world, not based on dynastic or royal lineage.  That he is an ally of Russia is a major concern of the US.  The US probably wishes he was their ally, instead.  An incursion by Turkish military forces would spell doom for al-Assad. The buffer zone that Turkey has cleared along it's border, and with the subsequent withdrawal of Nusra forces from the region, opens that vivid frontier of the future over which Turkish forces could overwhelm Damascus. Yet, the fresh involvement of Russia in arming and aiding the al-Assad regime underscores the key players actively pursuing their interests in the region. This will not be quiet and will not be quick. => http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-34241256"], [43, "2015-09-14T15:58:00Z", [0.9], "Evidence of massive Russian intervention in Syria is overwhelming with no end in sight of just how massive it might be.

The Russian moves include the recent transport of prefabricated housing units for as many as 1,000 advisers or other military personnel  to a Syrian airfield serving Latakia, the delivery of a portable air traffic control station there, and  military overflight requests with neighboring countries through September. There is no indication that Russia intends to deploy significant numbers of ground forces, but the housing would enable Russia to use the airfield as a major hub for ferrying in military supplies for the Syrian government, or possibly as a launching pad for Russian airstrikes in support of Mr. Assad\u2019s forces. Putin dismissed news reports that Russia had sent ground troops to fight in Syria as \u201cpremature.\u201d  \u201cWe are looking at various options, but so far what you are talking about is not on the agenda,\u201d he said. American intelligence analysts are also looking at ship loadings in Russia to determine what might be bound for Syria, and one official speculated that the Russian deployment might eventually grow to 2,000 to 3,000 personnel.  \u201cThere was no confirmation that large numbers of Russian soldiers, aircraft or heavy weapons had yet arrived.   If these reports are borne out, it would represent a very serious shift in the trajectory of the Syria conflict and call into question any Russian commitment to a peaceful settlement,\" say some.  But outlining his ideas on a potential diplomatic solution, Mr. Putin suggested that it be carried out in parallel with the fight against extremists and that Mr. Assad should play a role in the political process.  If Mr. Putin\u2019s intention is to support not just the Syrian government but also Mr. Assad, that could undercut Mr. Kerry\u2019s contention that the Syrian president needs to leave power as part of any political solution to the conflict.  And if Russian pilots carried out airstrikes, administration officials say, the choice of targets might further aggravate the growing chaos, if Russia targets rebel groups that are opposed to Mr. Assad. Another possibility is that Russia is taking these steps to secure its own interests in the event that the Assad government collapses, reaches a power-sharing agreement with the opposition or is replaced. By expanding its military influence in Syria, Russia might be in a stronger position to shape the political outcome as the Assad government\u2019s military position weakens by encouraging it to share power with opposition members Moscow supports. A former DIA officer who now studies Syria for a think tank, said \u201cAll this tells me is that the Russians are not backing away from the Assad regime,\u201d he said.\n~~~~~~~\nhttp://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-russia-syria-20150905-story.html U.S. officials  fear Moscow will help Assad's forces attack the government's opponents, some of whom the U.S. backs. The increased Russian involvement could extend Assad's hold on power. Until now, the Russian government has provided the Assad government financial support, intelligence information, weapons and spare parts for its Russian-made military equipment, but had not sent troops to Syria. Images of Russian-built warplanes and reconnaissance drones have appeared on social media accounts belonging to Syrian opposition fighters.  \"Any military support to the Assad regime for any purpose, whether it's in the form of military personnel, aircraft supplies, weapons or funding, is both destabilizing and counterproductive,\" White House spokesman said. The Syrian government is one of Russia's only allies in the region. Russia's sole military installation outside the borders of the former Soviet Union is a Cold War-era naval base in the Syrian city of Tartus. The base is some 35 miles south of Bassel al Assad International Airport, where the new Russian staging area is apparently being built. With the buildup, the Russians could be looking to increase their ability to resupply Assad's forces and bolster his tenuous hold on power. Assad's army has lost large numbers of soldiers and weapons amid rebel advances. The Russians also could help guard the Alawite home territory to ensure that Assad has a secure escape route and refuge if he loses control of the capital. While Putin routinely rejects Western demands that Assad step down and make way for peace and a new government of national unity, the Kremlin leader has lately intimated that his support for the embattled Syrian leader may have its limits.\nErdogan met with Putin in June and told journalists that he sensed a change in the Russian leader's previously unfettered backing of Assad. \"He is no longer of the opinion that Russia will support Assad to the end.

So far Russia has not joined the campaign against the militants and has avoided direct involvement in the fight.  Asked Friday about that possibility, Putin brushed it aside. \"We are already providing Syria with quite strong support in terms of equipment, training of military servicemen and weapons,\" he said. Since the Syrian civil war began in 2011, a steady stream of Russian weapons and resupply shipments have entered Syria to help Assad's forces.  But in recent weeks, reports show that assistance escalating. In August, news footage from Syria showed updated versions of Russian-made BTR-82A fighting vehicles with Russian military markings that hadn't been seen before in the country. A video clip from the conflict also appeared to show orders being given in Russian to a tank operator. Also last month, a website that tracks ships moving through the strait between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean published photos of a Russian landing ship that appeared to be carrying several armored vehicles under camouflage netting and four military transport trucks. \"Russia is one of Syria's most important allies and has supplied military and political support to the Assad regime since the beginning of this crisis,\" a U.S. intelligence official said. \"Whether stories of increased Russian assistance are wishful thinking or real support, they do highlight the increasing desperation of the Assad regime.\"\n~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  I'd be reducing my forecast further except I have read several reports that Putin is not totally committed to Assad.

No one was killed in that incident, but separate attacks left 9 dead. Officials at the Pentagon and State Department emphasized that the threats were longstanding and nonspecific, but there's no denying the Islamic State has taken a harsher line against Turkey in recent months, conducting a suicide attack against Kurdish activists in the town of Suru\u00e7 in July and threatening the country after Turkey's subsequent decision to allow American fighter jets to operate from Turkish soil\u2026. Reports out of Syria have increasingly pointed to the presence of Russian combat troops, vehicles, and fighter jets engaging in direct combat in support of the Assad regime.
