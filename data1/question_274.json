The official counts on his website are still behind final 2012 numbers, but this is to be expected with some states not having reported numbers for several weeks, and few having reported totals from today (Sunday) which is the biggest in-person early voting day of the cycle. That said, I think we should expect 2016 totals to exceed those from 2012 even if overall turnout is the same, because in general the states have been expanding early voting so a greater percentage of the voting will be done early.  There are some interesting trends though.  Most important, Latino early voting has been up a lot basically everywhere which reports on such demographics.  Latino turnout was only 47% in 2012, so there are a lot of potential new voters among the demographic.  Also, while it has been reported that early voting is down among black North Carolinians, the same is not true in other states, which indicates that this is likely due to changes in election laws and early voting locations and hours, not general enthusiasm.  Third, unaffiliated early voters are up significantly in most states.  Unaffiliated voters are a diverse group, but they are more likely to be younger, which is another demographic that typically has relatively low turnout. I don't want to read too much into early voting numbers but it seems that voters are quite motivated this year, and I'm continuing to shift my expectations of total turnout upwards. https://twitter.com/electproject?lang=en\nhttp://www.electproject.org/early_2016"], [13727, "2016-11-06T22:34:44Z", [0.1, 0.55, 0.35], "Although the campaign has been polarizing for many, fear is a powerful motivating force.

A mess! So I am going to start over with a comparable set of numbers, all based from this website:\nhttp://www.electproject.org/home/voter-turnout/voter-turnout-data Voting Eligible Population (VEP) has risen from 203.5 million in 2004 to 227.2 in 2014.  To maintain this path, this number has gone up about 2.5 million per year.  So a baseline VEP for 2016 would be about 232.2 million.   Now I will point out that my number is significantly different than that cited by PEW, and listed under question information.  I believe that number is 224 million.  I would exercise caution using that number and using participation rates from the U.S. election project website.  In order to avoid yet another inconsistency, I am abandoning the PEW number and using U.S. election project numbers exclusively.   Average turnout of VEP for presidential general elections for 2004, 2008, 2012 has been 60.0%.   Therefore, a mid-range number for total turnout in 2016 would be 139.3 million, which is admittedly significantly higher than the 129.1 experienced in 2012.  Say its at the low end of turnover (58.5% for 2012), we still have just under 135 million.  My bet is the higher turnout number is more likely because this is an election that has seen a lot of contention and effort to bring out the vote, with a lot of new registrants.  But even if we have lower end turnout for a presidential election, we are probably going to be very close to 135 million.   So I am switching (!) from 90/10 to 10/90.

The overall state of the campaign seems to be comparable with 2012 (a similar share of registered voters have made up their minds about who to vote for) with the exception of how hated the candidates are among supporters of the opponent. \"8 in 10 Trump supporters feel Clinton would do real damage to the country as president, while 83 percent of Clinton supporters feel the same way about Trump.\" One noteworthy stat: 81% of registered voters are \"Absolutely certain to vote\". In 2012 the same question was asked at about the same time in the campaign and 83% answered with \"Absolute certain\" (https://www.washingtonpost.com/page/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2012/09/11/National-Politics/Polling/release_126.xml) about 86% of registered voters went to the polls in that year.

Assuming that a similar trend to 2012 holds, we can expect 84% of registered voters to go to the polls, which would result in 131,076,406.51 voters, well short of Option 3.

Based on this I expect a total of 233,597,816 voters in Nov 2016. \"Less than 113 million\" (Option 1) would thus represent a turnout of < 48.7%, \"Between 113 million and 135 million, inclusive\" (Option 2) a turnout of between 48.7% and 57.8% and \"More than 135 million\" (Option 3) a turnout of > 57.8%. Option 1 would be the lowest turnout in U.S. history (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout_in_the_United_States_presidential_elections#Other_eligibility_factors). Option 2 would underperform the last three elections, but be in the range of most elections since 1968. Option 3 would present a continuation of the voter turnout figures seen since 2004.

There is no scientific consensus on how the current campaign will influence voter turnout and there is no historical example, either. Based on my own interpretation of turnout figures in multiple countries, I will argue that there are primarily two factors that could influence the turnout in the coming elections positively: sympathy or aversion to one of the candidates. Sympathy seems out of the question, given both candidates' high unfavorables, but aversion is obviously strong.  I think that aversion to both Clinton and Trump will drive participation in the polls of the supporters of their respective opponents, as both candidates and their campaigns will succeed in painting a picture of dire consequences, should their opponent be elected. This will be especially true if the election appears to be close. Given current estimates, Clinton has a decent, though not huge, lead in the polls.

Turnout has not been below 50% since 1924. Third party effect:\nRoss Perot's candidacy in 1992 seems to be the only case where a strong third party candidate seems to have increased voter turnout, and when he ran again in 1996, turnout returned to around the same level as 1988.  The conventional political wisdom is that Gary Johnson is not an especially strong third party candidate and is mostly drawing support from disaffected Clinton and Trump voters.  The one effect I could see Johnson having would be preventing turnout from falling too low by giving disaffected voters another option. Campaign negativity:\nBoth candidates have high feelings of negativity surrounding them, and the campaign has already been fairly negative.  Research on negative campaign ads seems to be quite mixed [1], but because Clinton and Trump are more disliked among their own party's voters than the typical nominee, I think the effect is more likely to be negative. Trump effect?:\nConventional wisdom holds that Trump's uniqueness as a candidate has an appeal to a different set of voters than a traditional Republican.  However, POLITICO analysis [2] showed that he was attracting voters who normally voted in the general to the election into the primary, not entirely new voters.  The 1968 election, in which Wallace tried to appeal to far-right groups and as a\"law and order\" candidate, also had pretty typical turnout for the era, suggesting that some of Trump's similar messages are unlikely to turnout any large group of new voters. If turnout from 2012 holds steady and 55% of the 10.7 new voters estimated by Pew turn up to vote then the total number of voters will be very close to 135 million.  I think it is more likely to be below this, but turnout being below 113 million would be a huge shift which I can't see happening.
