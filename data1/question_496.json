It\u2019s an ideal combination in this wealthy Atlanta suburb,\n. . . \n\"Ossoff effectively avoided Democratic opposition in his own race. Other Democrats ran, but the party, including neighboring Congressman John Lewis, coalesced early behind his candidacy and made him the de-facto nominee months before the first round of voting in April. \"The absence of pressure from the left let him craft his own message, one that emphasized cutting wasteful government spending instead of single-payer health care. Ossoff\u2019s own website doesn\u2019t even announce support for increasing the minimum wage to $15, a favorite position of liberals, including progressive icon Bernie Sanders. Ossof\u2019s site says the minimum wage should be increased \"at a pace that allows employers to adapt their business plans.\" \"He also has avoided direct criticism of Trump, and certainly has not suggested, as some Democrats have, that the party should consider impeachment. \"I\u2019m willing to work with on issues of mutual interest, if it\u2019s infrastructure, bringing jobs and investment to metro Atlanta,\" he told reporters Sunday, after stopping by one of his campaign\u2019s field offices to encourage volunteers. (Ossoff also said he would oppose Trump whenever the president \"embarrasses\" the country.) \"Republicans have consequently struggled to find fresh fodder for attacks, instead using well-worn criticisms that he\u2019s a supporter of House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and a liberal more at home in San Francisco than Georgia. \"He\u2019s basically done a good job of being two different people,\" said one Republican operative. \"The person the activist progressive base wants to throw huge sums of money at, and someone who wants to appeal to moderate voters in the district.\" \"The more centrist tack hasn\u2019t disappointed his supporters, either. In addition to raising an eye-popping $23 million through May, Ossoff has command of a volunteer army of 12,000 people \u2014 the kind of support many statewide candidates couldn\u2019t even match. \"It was abundantly clear during a series of weekend campaign stops that Ossoff is wildly popular among his supporters and local Democrats. Dozens of people surrounded him Saturday when he appeared at an afternoon celebration \u2014 a crowd larger than even the one that surrounded Lewis, the civil-rights leader who was campaigning with Ossoff that day. \"One young girl kept yelling his name over and over, while Ossoff signed at least four autographs for children over the course of the day. He took what seemed like a hundred pictures with supporters. . . .  Ossoff had \"galvanized\" local progressive groups and liberal activists who had participated in the Women\u2019s March in January.\n. . . \n\"Ossoff is by no means a perfect candidate: He\u2019s young and looks younger, and Republicans have exploited his background as a former Congressional aide. He also doesn\u2019t actually live in the district.

Meanwhile, Trump only won the district by 1.6% (often cited number, I don't have concrete number).
