First, the statute directed that the office of the independent counsel would terminate upon notification by the independent counsel to the Attorney General that the investigation and any subsequent prosecutions had been completed.63 Second, the statute permitted the special division of the court\u2014by its own choice or by the recommendation of the Attorney General\u2014to terminate the office at any time if the investigation had been completed or sufficiently completed, allowing DOJ to formally complete the inquiry under its own processes.64 In either case, the independent counsel was required to submit a report to the special division of the court detailing the work completed.65 The report was required to include \u201ca description of the work of the independent counsel, including the disposition of all cases brought.\u201d 66\u201d 2) The Mueller Report - https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/5955379/Redacted-Mueller-Report.pdf  Mueller did not terminate in this document (see page 11\u2026)"], [73722, "2019-05-19T22:33:43Z", [0.99], ""], [71996, "2019-05-19T21:45:24Z", [0.34], ""], [1333, "2019-05-19T18:21:33Z", [0.91], ""], [69034, "2019-05-19T13:42:06Z", [0.8], ""], [57778, "2019-05-19T07:54:59Z", [0.98], ""], [73689, "2019-05-19T06:44:42Z", [0.9], ""], [73674, "2019-05-18T21:22:59Z", [0.95], "This question should have been taken off the board in March 2019."], [73632, "2019-05-18T05:39:33Z", [0.9], ""], [62808, "2019-05-17T23:39:38Z", [1.0], ""], [73593, "2019-05-17T20:56:21Z", [0.65], ""], [691, "2019-05-17T20:28:57Z", [1.0], ""], [73564, "2019-05-17T15:36:50Z", [0.4], ""], [62808, "2019-05-17T11:39:23Z", [0.99], ""], [73511, "2019-05-17T10:07:09Z", [1.0], ""], [73499, "2019-05-17T08:13:09Z", [0.7], ""], [72705, "2019-05-17T08:09:25Z", [0.85], ""], [72705, "2019-05-17T08:08:56Z", [0.05], ""], [73477, "2019-05-17T07:16:43Z", [0.11], ""], [73470, "2019-05-17T05:52:38Z", [0.85], ""], [73458, "2019-05-17T05:25:20Z", [0.65], "If he \"was appointed to serve as Special Counsel to investigate Russian interference with the 2016 presidential election and related matters by Acting Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in May 2017\" it means that he has qualities so probably"], [73461, "2019-05-17T05:18:24Z", [0.96], "He is almost certain to resign or be pushed out by either democrats or republicans "], [73457, "2019-05-17T05:12:58Z", [0.67], ""], [73287, "2019-05-16T22:59:27Z", [0.27], ""], [73327, "2019-05-16T22:51:08Z", [0.75], "In light of his findings the matter will not go much further"], [73323, "2019-05-16T22:46:14Z", [0.71], ""], [73308, "2019-05-16T22:37:32Z", [1.0], ""], [73295, "2019-05-16T22:34:45Z", [0.75], ""], [73306, "2019-05-16T22:31:03Z", [0.99], ""], [73268, "2019-05-16T22:22:53Z", [1.0], "The investigation is done"], [73263, "2019-05-16T22:17:16Z", [0.95], ""], [73274, "2019-05-16T22:17:05Z", [0.55], ""], [73261, "2019-05-16T22:14:51Z", [0.45], ""], [14107, "2019-05-16T20:33:05Z", [0.98], ""], [70457, "2019-05-16T15:34:26Z", [1.0], ""], [63658, "2019-05-16T10:18:25Z", [0.95], "last month\nhttps://www.vox.com/2019/5/9/18537232/robert-mueller-trump-testimony-nadler"], [63658, "2019-05-16T09:35:33Z", [0.8], ""], [45141, "2019-05-15T19:34:52Z", [0.95], "I think he has already \"washed his hands\" of the issue and will let the  crowd decide.

I suspect the Mueller report will contain a lot of evidence that Trump supports cronyism and tradition white collar criminal behavior and networks with those who thrive on it because they will all support each other (which is sufficiently clear without the Mueller report proving it).  If so ending the Mueller investigation now would be a somewhat disappointing end for many Democrats and let Republicans move away from the siege against Trump and toward anything else more positive. Waiting to end the investigation, especially when there isn't any clear evidence that there is anything bigger than what's been made clear so far would increasingly justify Republican criticism of the investigation and it's political motivation and fuel conservative entrenchment into a pro-Trump camp rather than the more broad and diverse themes actually present across conservative-leaning voters.  That said, I honestly think Mueller doesn't care and will hold out as long as he has real evidence to pursue.

However, none of the current justices were on the court at the time, so there is a distinctly non-zero chance the decision would flip. As it pertains to conclusion of service, it's worth noting that the posed question asks about Mueller as special counsel generally, leaving open the possibility that additional investigations are opened, thus prolonging his period of service.

Also, Trump is becoming increasingly desperate to hold onto power and although there haven't been concerns about Mueller being fired since November I think there is still a possibility as historically again we see that special counsels that take on the president directly are more likely to be fired.  Now all of that being said, I still think the investigation will be finished by 2020. Even though special counsel investigations are long processes this investigation had indictments within the first 5 months which is not normally the case. While there is a case to be made that there seems to be a lot of information that needs to be investigated, this along with the early indictments to me speaks to the possibility of this case being more quickly conclusive.  Additionally, based off of Mueller's decision to uphold the standard of not investigating or announcing any indictments 30 days before the midterms, it is my belief that in anticipation of the upcoming elections he hopes to finish this investigation sooner rather than later.

Whitaker, the acting attorney general, announced on Monday that the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, is wrapping up his investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign and whether the Trump campaign cooperated with Moscow\u2019s operation. \u201cThe investigation is, I think, close to being completed, and I hope that we can get the report from Director Mueller as soon as possible,\u201d Mr. Whitaker said. His impromptu remark, at the end of a news conference about an unrelated case, was a highly unusual confirmation of the state of the special counsel\u2019s investigation. Justice Department policy ordinarily prohibits public comment on open criminal inquiries, and Mr. Mueller has refused to publicly discuss the investigation since he was appointed in May 2017 to oversee it. Mr. Whitaker, who is considered intensely loyal to President Trump, said that he had been \u201cfully briefed on the investigation\u201d and that he looked forward to Mr. Mueller delivering a report. Mr. Whitaker\u2019s comments appeared to take even Justice Department officials by surprise. As soon as he described the special counsel\u2019s work as nearly over, a spokeswoman shut down the news conference, declaring hastily: \u201cThat\u2019s all the time for today. Thank you so much.\u201d It was unclear whether Mr. Whitaker had discussed his comments with Mr. Mueller beforehand, or if he was speaking off the cuff. A spokesman for Mr. Mueller, Peter Carr, declined to comment. Prosecutors typically shy away from discussing the progress of investigations to avoid unfairly framing public expectations, partly because new evidence could unexpectedly arise. Mr. Whitaker acknowledged that tradition before giving his assessment of Mr. Mueller\u2019s progress. \u201cI am really not going to talk about an open and ongoing investigation,\u201d he said. Mr. Whitaker\u2019s remarks \u201cmay be harmless,\u201d said Barbara McQuade, a former United States attorney who now teaches law at the University of Michigan. Nonetheless, she said, \u201cThere isn\u2019t any advantage in announcing you are close to the end. You might think that you are close, and then your very last witness leads you to five new witnesses.\u201d\n. . . \nMr. Manafort\u2019s sentencing on his conviction on financial crimes, which was scheduled for next month, was delayed on Monday, according to a court filing. No new date was set. He was still scheduled to be sentenced in March in Washington on two conspiracy charges. In a possible sign that Mr. Mueller could close up shop before Mr. Stone\u2019s case is resolved, prosecutors from outside the special counsel\u2019s team were listed among those who will represent the government in court. Mr. Stone is scheduled to be arraigned on Tuesday in Washington.\n"], [38, "2019-01-29T06:00:11Z", [0.95], ""], [63691, "2019-01-28T23:50:56Z", [0.85], ""], [36132, "2019-01-28T17:23:40Z", [1.0], ""], [30610, "2019-01-28T11:49:06Z", [0.4], ""], [63658, "2019-01-28T08:52:42Z", [1.0], ""], [66692, "2019-01-28T07:26:52Z", [0.25], "I'm updating my forecast yet again.

There are (at least) two ways he could leave voluntarily: He will have completed the assignment, issued the report and initiated any needed legal action; or, he will choose to leave with the job unfinished, for unknown reasons (frustration, coercion by foreign agents or organized crime, etc). There are several ways he could leave involuntarily: the President could order his dismissal; the Deputy AG or AG could order his dismissal; or, he could have some public misstep where he breaks a law (or appears to) and is forced out by Congress, US SC, or the like.\nI will start with voluntary alternatives, which I think have the highest chance. Since he has been at the job for two years without finishing, the expected completion duration is another 2 years (see Lindy rule in Taleb's Skin in the Game), although I think the probabilities are front loaded to some degree. I think there's a 55% chance he will have completed his work within the next year, and leave voluntarily. The chances of leaving voluntarily for other reasons strike me as vanishingly small and don't affect my estimate.\nAccording to actuarial tables, he has about a 3.5% chance of dying in the next year (as a 74-75 year old man), and I will round up to 5% allowing for some grave injury or illness.  This puts my base estimate at about 60% (granted that straight addition of 55+5 isn't strictly correct).\nWhat strikes me as far less certain is the chance he could be forced to leave by the President or others. This could happen, theoretically, but I have a hard time imagining anyone taking that step for the President, no matter how bullet-proof they see themselves. I think it's very unlikely he will be forced out.\nI'm settling on 60% chance as a first estimate, and I qualify that by saying it will be because he will have completed his assignment to his satisfaction, more likely to be closer to the end of the year, rather than earlier."], [43311, "2019-01-14T16:13:10Z", [1.0], "Comment deleted on Jan 16, 2019 03:52PM UTC"], [66700, "2019-01-14T16:03:53Z", [0.7], ""], [56000, "2019-01-14T15:42:41Z", [0.45], ""], [24146, "2019-01-14T14:44:46Z", [0.65], "His investigation appears to be closing, and unlikely to linger for the entire year..."], [44782, "2019-01-14T14:15:53Z", [0.99], ""], [691, "2019-01-14T13:15:00Z", [0.99], ""], [66694, "2019-01-14T11:51:06Z", [0.75], ""], [60757, "2019-01-14T10:18:37Z", [0.15], "It would be very poorly received politically on both sides of the isle for such an agent to happen."], [66689, "2019-01-14T08:36:10Z", [0.75], "The investigation appears to be nearing final stages.

I put the possibilities into 3 large buckets (resignation, dismissal, other).  Although there are many reasons for resignation, the two I assume are of greatest probability are (1) he completes his work and (2) he gets fed up or feels he can no longer perform the job and decides to quit before the job is done.  Many people assume that Mueller will issue a final report soon and that will end his tenure. While possible, this seems to me unlikey given what the Special Proscutor's office actually has to do after the dust settles and the press walks away. Two previous special counsel's, let alone Ken Starr's investigation as Independent Counsel (which started in 1994), have taken several years on average to complete (Pat Fitzgerald's Plame investigation took 3 years; Danforth's Waco investigation to 7 years). Mueller's investigation only started in May 2017, therefore it seems unlikely he would complete his investigation and prosecutions (especially if trials are required) before January 2020. More likely is that he will issue some report on the investigation, but will continue to prosecute individuals who do not plea--it's not just about his Trump findings. If so, this could take months or years. Indeed, we haven't heard a peep from Mueller about the possibility of charges against any of Trump's inner circle (kids, in-laws) other than Manafort (on other charges, not collusion)  or the president himself. If any of the inner circle expect to be charged we will hear about that as it will get leaked (not by Mueller's team, but by the targets). Even if they eventually plead, the process around pleading and sentencing will take a long time and I don't think we are anywhere near that, even with nearly a year to go. While he could theoretically resign before all prosecutions are complete and leave those to a deputy, it is not yet clear whether he would be so inclined and while the press and American public might move on from monitoring bit player trials, Mueller's team would still be there prosecuting them. So unless everyone indicted or to be indicted pleads guilty, some work will likely continue into 2020. I therefore only give an pre-2020 resignation date at no more than 15%. On  (2), he seems to have weathered the political storm sufficiently to avoid having to resign. Even if a new AG comes in and puts pressure on him to finish the job quickly, it seems unlikely he would succumb to pressure to quit or feel ineffective given he is presumably far enough long in the investigation to at least report out findings/conclusions about the president and his inner circle.  He could also be fired by the acting or new Attorney General. Such a move, however, would come with great political risk that other Republicans would balk at and, as such, would try to convince Trump to avoid having the AG do that for fear of political backlash. if Mueller starts to close the net on the inner circle, we may hear more clamoring to fire him, but it would be political suicide to do so then. At this point, it seems too late to fire him and it would look like a hatchet job leading to potential grounds for impeachment. I put this at no more than 5%.  There could be some non-political or work-related reason for his departure (health, family issues, etc.) but those seem fairly remote and I discount them completely here without any negative info.   All in, this leads me to a no more than 20% probability."], [66512, "2019-01-10T20:23:25Z", [0.2], "I predict that Mueller's investigation will reveal several instances of criminal activity on the part of Donald Trump and, unless cases are passed on to federal district prosecutors, these cases will  not be wrapped up by the end of 2019.

Elliot Ness. J. Edgar Hoover. Inspector Clouseau. James Comey. The names reflect a continuum of greatness to farce and mediocrity. In the annals of U.S. law enforcement, no individual has reached the depths of disgrace as James \u201cCardinal\u201d Comey. The \u201cCardinal\u201d was a sobriquet FBI agents used to denigrate their leader. As Deputy Attorney General, he was called \u201cdrama queen.\u201d Known for his pomposity and self-regard, Comey cut a swath of arrogance unknown in either of those illustrious organizations. He was the cult of personality. He surrounded himself with sycophants, people dedicated to his promotion and their advancement. The Bureau and the public became the losers. James Comey politicized the FBI, America\u2019s premier law enforcement agency. It started on July 6, 2016, when he usurped the authority of Attorney General Loretta Lynch in violation of the Constitution, the law and DOJ regulations. He destroyed Hillary\u2019s campaign when he unethically and unprofessionally described her conduct with pejorative words such as \u201ccriminal\u201d and then illegally exonerated her of the crimes. President Obama should have fired him that day. But he did not. Why? Perhaps because he had knowledge of Hillary\u2019s avoidance of any protected email channels because he communicated with her on her private server using a pseudonym. Comey is a poseur. He pretends to be Thomas Becket but he is, in fact, the assassin, Henry II. He claims in his memos he doesn\u2019t do sneaky things, leak or do weasely things. Yet in his interview with Fox News\u2019 Bret Baier he pretended not to know what a leak is. The president performed a public service by firing him. He should have done it the day after his inauguration. The treachery revealed by Comey, Clapper, and Brennan requires accountability. That can only happen through a federal grand jury investigation headed by John W. Huber, the U.S. Attorney in Utah who has been appointed to investigate the FISA criminality by the Obama FBI and DOJ. The evidence of illegal and unconstitutional abuse of law enforcement and intelligence community power and authority is clear. Grand jury subpoenas need to be issued. These individuals have stolen more than fifteen months of a new president\u2019s tenure. They have thrown the country needlessly into spasms of doubt about the bona fides of an election. Cardinal Comey should get the first grand jury subpoena.\"--Joseph diGenova is a former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, co-founder of the law firm of diGenova & Toensing and an informal legal adviser to President Trump.

Based on what I can find, Mueller will almost certainly not be done this year (see link) because special counsel investigations almost always take many years. More broadly about the special counsel role itself, the term and position have changed over time but there have been 10 up to and including Watergate and 18 since, not counting Mueller. I make the distinction because the 18 were appointed under a now lapsed independent council law that prohibited the president from firing them. Of the original 10, three were fired before they completed their work so my baseline here is 33% yes. Of those three two were fired after they went after the president directly (Grant and Henderson, Nixon and Cox) while the third was fired after he went comically overboard and started an investigation of the IRS by investigating every senior member of government (Truman and Morris). Of the other seven one was appointed by congress to investigate the Coolidge administration and he couldn't be fired and the other six were all appointed to investigate scandals in specific departments of the government like the post office or office of the navy. Of the special counsels that specifically investigated the president, all were actually fired, although typically the investigations didn't stop and someone else came in to finish the job. That being said, the president seems smart enough to have decided to hinder the investigation rather than fire Mueller. If Mueller indicted a family member or something I think there is a chance Mueller is fired but short of that I think the investigation rolls on. https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/mueller-is-moving-quickly-compared-to-past-special-counsel-investigations/"], [65958, "2019-01-07T01:29:58Z", [0.65], "I think he will finish his investigation and hopefully share his results with the \nAmerican people."], [65953, "2019-01-07T01:29:12Z", [0.75], ""], [65950, "2019-01-07T01:21:47Z", [0.5], ""], [65954, "2019-01-07T01:16:33Z", [0.45], "He will want to be done by then."], [65924, "2019-01-07T01:16:18Z", [0.75], ""], [64612, "2019-01-07T01:15:41Z", [0.95], "I presume that he is no longer special counsel once he issues his report, and I truly believe the report will be submitted by late summer at the latest."], [65951, "2019-01-07T01:11:34Z", [0.05], "He will stick with his job until it is completely finished.

That investigation eventually morphed with the Monica Lewinsky scandal. It went on for 2,978 days...The investigation into the arms deals around the Iran-Contra affair under President Ronald Reagan lasted 2,420 days.\"[1] The number of days from May 17, 2017 to January 1, 2020 is 959 days. I think it is obvious from the indictments that there is more substance here than average, so it is almost certainly going to go for 55 days longer than average. I'd bet it will go through at least 2020 as well. So, if we went with straight base rate. We'd have to go with 2% or so, allowing that Mueller might die or have some other issue where he wouldn't be able to perform his duties. But, we have Trump in the equation. He probably hasn't tried to fire Mueller yet because he (or his handlers) doesn't want to precipitate a Saturday Night Massacre style Constitutional crisis until he has no other choice.[2] We have a House coming online who will be using their oversight powers, which will give Mueller some cover. The question is whether this thing is going to come to a head in the coming year. It seems to me that there is a lot of random chance in this choice that is hard to predict in advance. I think Mueller keeps quietly hammering away until 2020. But, Trump is unpredictable. I'm going go with a 35% chance. That's a Brier score of .245 if I'm right and .845, if I'm wrong. I can live with that.
