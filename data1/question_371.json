The fall through of the LSE-Deutsche B\u00f6rse merger is an example of this. Europe faces severe uncertainty from the elections in Netherlands, France, Germany and possibly Italy (where the political situation is chaotic in any case). On the other hand economic activity is picking up, and the interest rate environment is still very low.  It's good to remember that the first half of 2016 was a time of decreasing activity (as highlighted in the question description) with many of these same uncertainties present and greater fears of China's growth and a disappointing start of the year regarding equities. As the process is long and can take 6-12 months to conclude, the deals being made in Q2 would have been put in motion in H2 2016, during which deal making significantly increased from H1.

LSE went up from 2,744 to 2,914 (up 6%) This means the same set of companies is worth 6-9% more than what it was during the last year. If the index stays at this level, then the same number of mergers will lead to a higher value of M&A deals (other things being constant). If the index goes up, that also should lead to a higher level of M&A deals. If the index falls (by more than 5%), the deal value could be less than the deal value of last year.  A 5 year price chart of the three indices shows that the NYSE Composite and Nasdaq were down in 2016 versus their 2015 levels. This could have been one reason for lower value of deals that got concluded - since the companies had less value. Also, companies are less likely to want to sell themselves when the price is low. This gives me some additional confidence in the reasoning.  So what's the possibility of the major global indices being down by 5% or more during the second quarter of 2017? Right now, the expectation is that Donald Trump's policies will boost the US economy (and hopefully the stock markets by linkage). I think less than 50% chance that index will have a serious fall in the next 6 months - probably 25%.
