Islamist militant group Boko Haram has killed more than 20,000 people since 2009 as part of its attempt to create an Islamic state in the Lake Chad basin. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the latest attack, which emergency officials and members of a government-approved vigilante group said was carried out by four female bombers in the Muna Garage district of Maiduguri at about 06:00 p.m. (1700 GMT). The use of female bombers is a hallmark of Boko Haram attacks. \u201cWe have so far recorded 10 people\u2019s deaths and about 30 victims injured,\u201d said Bello Dambatta, a spokesman for the State Emergency Agency (SEMA).
