I notice I'm the only super-nerd posting so much text but it's for my own personal record): That was painful to watch. My original prediction was 63-37 for the Pats, which turned out good, but I changed my prediction in the middle of the game. My final (before the announcement) prediction was 70-30 Pats when they were advancing the end-zone the final time. Good\nMy initial prediction was okay. I feel good about the process I used to get there. I also feel comfortable w/ the fact I switched to the Falcons winning, but more on that below. Bad\nMy lack of knowledge in the game really hurt me tonight. I didn't know about a 2-point conversion until it was about to happen, so I had some higher Atlanta Falcon probabilities because I thought that, even with a touchdown and field goal, the Pats would be 27-28. That meant that a penalty or something would have to happen for them to get that extra point, which I considered was probable not to happen in such a short time frame. So, if I had known about the 2-point conversion (that they could run it in for an extra point instead of kicking it), my probabilities for Falcons would not have been as high b/c I thought the Pats had to make 2 spectacular plays, not 1 to get the 28-28. I am a little upset I changed so much during the game. I understand changing based on the Pats being behind 4 touchdowns is reasonable, but near the end when it was closer to a toss-up, I think I let my adrenaline add more probability where it shouldn't have been. However, I think if I came in the game blind the 3rd quarter, saw the score and Tom Brady + the Pats offense dropping the football, I would've given a higher probability for the Falcons. So I do think my conversion from 63-37 Pats --> 63-->37Falcons was reasonable, and even a 70-30 Falcons was reasonable, but putting it to 90-10 at one point (when I knew little about the game... take case 1: the 2 point conversion thing that ruined my night), especially when this is the first football game I really invested myself in was ambitious and not my best judgment. There IS credit to be given to people who watch these games and have a sense of timing about them. From an outsider view, 2 minutes to comeback seems ridiculous, but it could physically be done. If I had a better base understanding of the sport and its rules, maybe I would've been more conservative. Pat on Back\nI think it was ESPN or FOX that had the Falcons at 99% for a bit. I didn't go that far. For that I am pleased. Overall\nGood start. I like my process at the beginning. I was weak when it came to updating b/c I didn't know what data is relevant to include in my forecast or not w/ sports except for extreme injuries. I did not update my forecast w/ Matt Ryan getting MVP b/c I figured the weight of that already was told in their #1 offense ranking. My endgame was reasonable... I am comfortable w/ the fact I switched at one point, but need to find a way to be more rational up to the very end and not let my fan excitement get the better of my forecasting. What a game. If you asked me to forecast how awesome Gaga's performance would be, that would've been easier. She did great. Tom Brady took a decade off of my life, but it was an amazing 4th quarter to experience."], [10267, "2017-02-06T04:41:37Z", [0.0, 1.0], ""], [12879, "2017-02-06T04:23:39Z", [0.85, 0.15], ""], [12879, "2017-02-06T04:22:30Z", [0.8, 0.2], ""], [4645, "2017-02-06T03:59:21Z", [0.01, 0.99], ""], [25997, "2017-02-06T03:35:48Z", [0.0, 1.0], ""], [32769, "2017-02-06T03:33:14Z", [0.0, 1.0], ""], [31509, "2017-02-06T03:30:35Z", [0.0, 1.0], "Oops"], [29623, "2017-02-06T03:29:47Z", [0.0, 1.0], ""], [32773, "2017-02-06T03:28:57Z", [0.0, 1.0], ""], [32838, "2017-02-06T03:27:43Z", [0.0, 1.0], ""], [32836, "2017-02-06T03:27:17Z", [0.0, 1.0], ""], [32870, "2017-02-06T03:26:38Z", [0.0, 1.0], ""], [32836, "2017-02-06T03:26:26Z", [0.01, 0.99], "Comment deleted on Feb 06, 2017 03:26AM UTC"], [32863, "2017-02-06T03:26:25Z", [0.0, 1.0], ""], [29680, "2017-02-06T03:25:56Z", [0.0, 1.0], ""], [16284, "2017-02-06T03:25:54Z", [1.0, 0.0], ""], [32800, "2017-02-06T03:25:37Z", [0.0, 1.0], ""], [32785, "2017-02-06T03:25:35Z", [0.0, 1.0], ""], [32863, "2017-02-06T03:24:57Z", [0.2, 0.8], ""], [11733, "2017-02-06T03:24:49Z", [0.0, 1.0], ""], [27480, "2017-02-06T03:24:08Z", [0.05, 0.95], ""], [28246, "2017-02-06T03:23:44Z", [0.0, 1.0], ""], [11733, "2017-02-06T03:23:20Z", [0.05, 0.95], "1st and goal"], [28563, "2017-02-06T03:23:12Z", [0.2, 0.8], ""], [11733, "2017-02-06T03:22:45Z", [0.2, 0.8], ""], [32870, "2017-02-06T03:22:21Z", [0.01, 0.99], ""], [12006, "2017-02-06T03:22:19Z", [0.0, 1.0], ""], [28563, "2017-02-06T03:21:44Z", [0.8, 0.2], ""], [11733, "2017-02-06T03:21:33Z", [0.25, 0.75], "ATL suddenly looking like one of league's worst defenses."], [32884, "2017-02-06T03:20:48Z", [0.4, 0.6], "Damn son.

BIASES\nI am starting in on this w/ no real prior knowledge of football besides a basic idea of the game and league setup, so that could be a blessing and a curse.\n\u2022\tPro: no biases towards which team I \"want\" to win, no team loyalty.\n\u2022\tCon: no supporting knowledge of the team's strengths and weaknesses. BASELINE/OUTSIDE\nI can form a decent baseline w/ a lifelong devotion to the two teams. I\u2019m going to look at it from a way-outside view, not even considering the specific teams but instead will form a baseline based on the conferences themselves. (For those who don't know: the Superbowl is a clash between the AFC and NFC conference champs.) My baseline: 58.8% towards Pats, based on data since 2000. I chose 2000 as my start point for evaluating data because:\n\u2022\tthe Pat head coach joined the Pats then (the current Falcon head coach joined in 2015\u2026 more on him later)\n\u2022\tthe oldest players on both teams started as pros in 2000 (Tom Brady to the Pats, and Matt Bryant to an European league)\nI figure data before 2000 will have little effect on this new gen. of football. The AFC (the Pats conference) won 10 Superbowls, while the NFC (the Falcon's conference) won 7 since 2000. 10/17 = 58.8% for the AFC. Will keep the decimal, because 1% can make a big difference according to Tetlock. UNIQUE/INSIDE\nLooking inward, I am going to adjust up, since the Pats have a history w/ their current coach of going to the Superbowl and winning. Since 2000, they've won 4 times, and placed 2nd twice. HOWEVER 2 of those wins were in 2004 and 2005, w/ current qback Brady as the qback then. That was over 10 years ago, though they won in 2015 w/ him as a qback. So this may cast some doubt, but he has recently been successful.\n# playoff appearances since 2000 for Pats: 14\n# playoff appearances since 2000 for Falcons: 7  I\u2019M WRONG (???)\nReasonable doubt is cast w/ the new coach of the Falcons, Dan Quinn. He was hired in 2015 after their other coach was fired for two bad seasons (14th in conference in 2013, 12th in 2014), and in 2015 the Falcons were 7th in their conference (still did not qualify for conference playoffs), and 2nd this year (though still winning NFC champs). This means that pre-2015, it\u2019s hard to compare the Falcons v. Pats track record since this new administration is producing different results from the old one. However, the old one did comparably well in 2012 where they made it to the finals of their conference champs, and they also have had the same starting qb since 2008\u2026 so comparing their histories is pretty fair. Though they\u2019ve changed administrations, there were only two big slump years and key players remained constant for almost a decade. Also, the Falcons have the #1 offense in the league (Pats: #3). This is based on NFL stats, and based on the number of points scored per game. Balance this doubt with the fact that the Falcons have #27 defense, with the Pats at #1.  CONCLUSION\n58.8% base  adjust up for history of Pat excellence, say history is weighted by 2% = 60.8% Though the Falcons have #1 offense, their defense is not so hot (#27) v. Pat #3 offense and #1 defense. Given this distribution, adjust up for Pats b/c of well-rounded team at to 61.8%. Adjust for confidence: I am under-confident on things I can reason through but am not an expert at (based on distribution from the tests), overconfident for things I think I know like facts. Since I reasoned through this but am not an expert at sports, I am probably more under-confident so will adjust up more to compensate. 61.8 to 62.8 to 63% 63% for Pats.
