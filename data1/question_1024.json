The announcement prompted human rights groups, aid agencies, and many governments to raise concern about safety issues for Rohingya back in Myanmar. More than 700,000 Rohingya refugees have fled to Bangladesh since last year, when Myanmar's armed forces, backed by Buddhist extremist mobs, intensified a crackdown that had already been underway against the Muslim community in Myanmar's Rakhine State. Thousands of Rohingya Muslims were killed, and others only survived by fleeing to Bangladesh, where they now face potential violence as well. This is while Bangladesh's foreign secretary and refugee commissioner have several times offered assurances that they would not send the Rohingya back against their will. Dozens of Rohingya families, who were placed on a list of 2,200 refugees \"approved\" for return by Myanmar, told The Guardian that they did not want to return under the current conditions."], [1333, "2018-11-16T15:22:28Z", [0.15], "https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/myanmar/2018/myanmar-181114-presstv01.htm?_m=3n%252e002a%252e2426%252elo0ao02gx5%252e28f6"], [62731, "2018-11-16T04:18:43Z", [0.12], ""], [691, "2018-11-15T16:52:21Z", [0.03], ""], [82, "2018-11-15T04:56:47Z", [0.75], ""], [60593, "2018-11-13T22:07:53Z", [0.9], "Due to the lack of serious action over the genocide perpetrated against the Rohingya by the Myanmar government by international actors, the likelihood of action to mitigate the conflict will not be forthcoming nor effective if they are. What's more, the UN's designation of the conflict as a information blackhole except satellite imagery that has already shown the displacement and likely killing of much more than 1000 civilians is likely to mean that the government can continue or escalate its campaign without limits. Additionally, the military's tight control over the government, as shown through President Aung San Suu Kyi's inaction and rhetoric, means that this campaign of cleansing will continue into the foreseeable future. The time period in question is a fairly long one for the severity of a conflict of this magnitude to kill 1000 or more civilians.
