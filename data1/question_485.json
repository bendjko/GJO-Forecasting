The jihadist group continues to gain ground in Afghanistan despite a change in US strategy that has reduced restrictions on commanders to launch airstrikes against the group. The Taliban said it seized Shib Koh district in Farah province and Maruf in Kandahar in separate statements released over the past several days on Voice of Jihad, the group\u2019s official website. Afghan officials and residents of Shib Koh confirmed the Taliban overran the district. \u201cRight now I am on the roof of my house, watching Taliban blowing up the district center and torching three security forces\u2019 vehicles,\u201d a civilian in the district told Pajhwok Afghan News. The secretary of the Farah provincial capital also confirmed the district was under Taliban control. A statement released by the Taliban claimed that several security outposts in the district were captured while \u201cas many as 12 Ranger pickups have been destroyed and a ranger pickup, 1 APC, 28 rifles, 5 PK machine guns, 4 RPG launchers, 1 pistol and other equipment were seized as war spoils.\u201d The Taliban has had a destabilizing influence on Farah province. Of the province\u2019s 11 districts, five are under Taliban control (Qala Ka, Khaki Safed, Bala Buluk, Gulistan, and Shib Koh), and three more are heavily contested (Bakwa, Pusht Rod, and Anar Dara), according to assessments by FDD\u2019s Long War Journal. The Taliban also reported that it overran Maruf in Kandahar after Afghan forces \u201cfled and abandoned Maruf district administration center due to fear of Mujahideen attacks.\u201d The jihadist group reported 12 Afghan soldiers were killed and 16 others were captured, while Afghan forces torched \u201call equipment and installations before fleeing\u201d but left behind \u201ca Dshk gun, 6 PKM machine guns, 3 RPG launchers, 13 AK rifles, 1 binocular, 2 mortar tubes and 2 motorbikes behind.\u201d The Taliban\u2019s claim that it controls Maruf cannot be independently verified by FDD\u2019s Long War Journal, however the report is very likely to be accurate. Similar Taliban reports have proven correct in the past. Maruf District was recently overrun on Sept. 17, when the Taliban raided the base, seized weapons and equipment, and then suddenly withdrew. The Taliban continues to make inroads in Kandahar province. As of March 26, the Taliban claimed to control five of Kandahar\u2019s 18 districts (Ghorak, Miyanashin, Registan, Shorabak, and Maruf) and heavily contest four more (Arghastan, Khakrez, Maiwand, and Shahwalikot). FDD\u2019s Long War Journal assesses the Taliban\u2019s claims of control to be credible. Of the remaining nine districts, the Taliban says it does \u201cnot control any specific area\u201d but \u201conly carryout [sic] guerilla attacks.\u201d If the Taliban was exaggerating its control in Kandahar, it likely would claim to control or contest at least some areas of districts such as Panjwai and Zhari. Taliban founder and its first emir, Mullah Omar, founded the Taliban in Panjwai, and Zhari is considered the spiritual home of the group.\" Sad"], [368, "2017-10-16T21:23:15Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-10-16T12:43:57Z", [0.0], ""], [6303, "2017-10-16T03:21:29Z", [0.0], "Based on general news and GJP consensus."], [691, "2017-10-15T23:27:01Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-10-15T21:31:46Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-10-15T19:23:04Z", [0.0], ""], [2965, "2017-10-15T13:02:55Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-10-14T17:47:06Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-10-14T13:06:47Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-10-13T23:54:00Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-10-13T18:04:23Z", [0.0], ""], [39938, "2017-10-13T09:56:18Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-10-12T19:15:13Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-10-11T20:21:56Z", [0.0], ""], [4634, "2017-10-11T05:40:51Z", [0.0], "Info on Karzai's latest moves: https://www.afghanistan-analysts.org/mehwar-e-mardom-e-afghanistan-new-opposition-group-with-an-ambiguous-link-to-karzai/ TL;DR He's in a loose coalition with the 'Mehwar-e Mardom-e Afghanistan', the country's newest political group, but they do not agree on what should come first, elections or the loya jirga.

Defense Secretary James Mattis noted progress within the Afghan military and government, saying \u201cthere has been a wholesale swap-out\u201d of officials who have been judged incompetent or corrupt in the Afghan administration. Those in place now are \u201cnot colored by the old way of doing business,\u201d which was marked by reports of bribery, theft and \u201cghost troops.\u201d He said that, as part of the new military strategy, all six regional Afghan Army corps are engaged in offensive operations against the Taliban and its ally, the Haqqani Network. Those army units are being backed by an increased number of NATO air strikes. The rules of engagement covering air operations also have been expanded under the new strategy. Between the change in air operations and an increase in U.S. advisors helping Afghan combat units, the Afghan security force blunted the Taliban\u2019s spring and summer offensive and has seen a decrease in casualties. Mattis said in his opening statement, \u201cwar is principally a matter of will, and the international community is making clear that it will stand alongside the Afghans\u2019 commitment to this fight.\u201d Other promising developments are on the horizon. Dunford said the expansion of air operations with Afghan helicopter and fixed-wing crews and special forces in the Afghan army; the expansion counterterrorism efforts not only by the U.S. but from China, Russia, India and Pakistan; and the Afghan government\u2019s new crackdown on corruption were \u201cobjectives that are clear and achievable.\u201d Describing the pressure the United States will be putting on Pakistan to stop providing safe havens for terrorist organizations, Mattis said the idea is to put Islamabad in a position where \u201cit can see where their interests converge with the international community\u2019s.\u201d He acknowledged that Pakistan has suffered high casualties battling terrorists inside its borders, and the government has indicated a willingness to cooperate with others in eliminating these sanctuaries used to attack Afghanistan and India. Mattis added that despite any positive cooperation with the Pakistani government, \u201cISI [Pakistani intelligence services] appears to run its own foreign policy.\u201d yes it does and as long as

Trump\u2019s reservations about sending more troops to Afghanistan have triggered a new exploration of an option long considered unlikely: withdrawal. Unable to agree on a plan to send up to 3,900 more American forces to help turn back Taliban advances in Afghanistan, the White House is taking a new look at what would happen if the U.S. decided to scale back its military presence instead, according to current and former Trump administration officials. \u201cIt\u2019s a macro question as to whether the U.S., this administration, and this president are committed to staying,\u201d one senior administration official said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work unless we are there for a long time, and if we don\u2019t have the appetite to be there a long time, we should just leave. It\u2019s an unanswered question.\u201d The exploration is an outgrowth of a deep divide at the White House, where the president and his top advisers are reluctant to send more American troops to Afghanistan without a clear strategy. There appears to be support in the administration for a modest plan to send a few thousand more U.S. troops to Afghanistan, to put more pressure on Pakistan to crack down on militant sanctuaries, and to seek help from China, India and Pakistan in reaching regional peace deals. But there is no consensus, said people involved in the debate, making it unlikely that the U.S. would send more forces to help the Afghan government repel Taliban advances this summer. Administration officials face a conundrum: They want to avoid setting deadlines for pulling out troops, but they are wary of embracing an open-ended commitment that could pull more U.S. forces back into a deadly, 16-year-old conflict (para. 1-6).

An ethnic Tajik and the deputy of Jamiat-e Islami, Massoud had joined Ghani\u2019s ticket in the run-off election in 2014 and later served as an important asset for Ghani in providing ethnic balance in his appointments. After his dismissal, Massoud sharply criticized the move, stating that the president has neither the power nor the authority to remove him. He also threatened that his dismissal could move the country close to civil war. Although he is not a strong enough figure to mobilize crowds large enough to threaten the stability of the government, some believe that the firing may trigger Tajiks to mobilize around an ethnic cause. The Jamiat-e Islami party had a meeting following Massoud\u2019s dismissal in which many of its leaders, including Abdullah and Ata Mohammad Noor, participated. Massoud\u2019s spokesman even talked of establishing an interim government and seeking Ghani\u2019s resignation (para. 1-2). With no Loya Jirga convened to amend the constitution and incorporate the CEO post into the legal framework, and with Parliament working on an extended mandate, the current government set-up lacks legal definition and support. The ethno-political imbalance and ethnic heterogeneity, now symbolized by Massoud\u2019s ouster, further compounds the situation. With a lack of political will to hold parliamentary and district council elections, and a lack of commitment to ethnically rebalance the government, the future looks grim (para.10). Alizada, B.

Deputy spokesman for the CEO, Javid Faisal, speaking at a press conference here stressed implementation of the political agreement on the national unity government, including change in the political system. \u201cThe aim of decentralizing the current centralized system is to devolve the power to people, so government services are delivered to people fast and quickly,\u201d he said. Based on the political agreement, a Loya Jirga, or grand assembly, was expected to be held within two years of the September 2014 election to amend the Constitution and create a prime ministerial post for Abdullah (para. 1-4). \u201cTwo backgrounds are available for holding the Loya Jirga, the first is electoral reform that has been done and the second is parliamentary and district council election, a process under work,\u201d he said (para. 9).

swinging\nright now DOD is taking urgent steps with respect to Afghan and comprehensive proposal to Congress by 7-15\nGuardian summary US senators have sharply criticized Pentagon leaders for not completing a new strategy for the 16-year-old war in Afghanistan, as the defense secretary, James Mattis, admitted: \u201cWe are not winning in Afghanistan right now.\u201d John McCain demanded that Mattis wrap up the plan now, threatening: \u201cUnless we get a strategy from you, you\u2019re going to get a strategy from us.\u201d He said he had expected the plan in the first 30 to 60 days of the new administration and snapped: \u201cWe want a strategy. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a hell of a lot to ask.\u201d Mattis, in response, told the Senate armed services committee that he would provide details on the new strategy for the war in mid-July. \u201cWe\u2019re putting it together now and there are going to be \u2013 there are actions being taken to make certain that we don\u2019t pay a price for the delay,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we recognize the need for urgency and your criticism is fair, sir.\u201d Mattis did not say what those steps were. The US has about 8,400 troops in Afghanistan. Gen John Nicholson, the top US commander in Afghanistan, has told Congress that he could use an infusion of US and allied troops to bolster support for the Afghan army. Earlier this year, the Pentagon was considering a request for roughly 3,000 more troops, mainly for training and advising. That decision, however, has been stalled by the broader administration review of Afghan policy and a push for Nato to contribute more troops. Mattis, when pressed again about the plan, said getting a government-wide strategy could not be done quickly, and that there were efforts to ensure Nato participation so that it was \u201cnot all on the backs of American taxpayers\u201d. \u201cWe are not winning in Afghanistan right now. And we will correct this as soon as possible\" NATO will  not be  the answer especially after Taormina We need to leave politics at the waters edge or US will  be perceived as in terminal decline as world power"], [691, "2017-06-13T18:01:21Z", [0.02], ""], [26242, "2017-06-13T15:42:24Z", [0.05], ""], [1034, "2017-06-13T05:30:43Z", [0.0], ""], [35806, "2017-06-12T18:50:10Z", [0.21], ""], [35806, "2017-06-12T18:49:44Z", [0.6], ""], [368, "2017-06-12T18:18:13Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-06-12T13:49:08Z", [0.02], ""], [34613, "2017-06-12T13:48:38Z", [0.3], ""], [1034, "2017-06-12T06:58:50Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-06-12T01:18:04Z", [0.0], ""], [2965, "2017-06-11T15:49:41Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-06-11T06:33:17Z", [0.0], ""], [15196, "2017-06-10T21:17:27Z", [0.05], ""], [691, "2017-06-10T13:07:41Z", [0.02], ""], [1034, "2017-06-10T08:02:12Z", [0.0], ""], [13377, "2017-06-09T19:59:23Z", [0.1], ""], [368, "2017-06-09T19:52:30Z", [0.0], ""], [2965, "2017-06-09T14:23:09Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-06-09T06:23:12Z", [0.0], ""], [35398, "2017-06-09T03:41:02Z", [0.35], ""], [601, "2017-06-08T22:45:08Z", [0.14], ""], [1333, "2017-06-08T22:03:02Z", [0.04], ""], [368, "2017-06-08T18:38:58Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-06-08T12:20:19Z", [0.03], ""], [1034, "2017-06-08T05:44:25Z", [0.0], ""], [35960, "2017-06-08T04:31:03Z", [0.1], ""], [368, "2017-06-07T19:21:24Z", [0.0], ""], [2965, "2017-06-07T16:23:01Z", [0.0], ""], [16652, "2017-06-07T08:53:46Z", [0.05], ""], [1034, "2017-06-07T07:09:05Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-06-06T18:13:05Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-06-06T14:38:51Z", [0.04], ""], [2965, "2017-06-06T10:11:49Z", [0.0], "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-40170596"], [1034, "2017-06-06T06:18:44Z", [0.0], ""], [2965, "2017-06-05T21:31:34Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-06-05T17:22:13Z", [0.0], ""], [2965, "2017-06-05T15:48:30Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-06-05T06:24:35Z", [0.0], ""], [554, "2017-06-04T23:37:31Z", [0.09], ""], [691, "2017-06-04T20:12:30Z", [0.05], ""], [368, "2017-06-04T17:59:59Z", [0.0], ""], [35405, "2017-06-04T17:28:58Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-06-04T06:44:59Z", [0.0], "Loya Jirga be convened to amend Constitution: CEO Hamdard (2017) Feb 09, states that: KABUL (Pajhwok): A spokesman for the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) on Thursday announced support to a decentralized system and demanded holding of a loya jirga to amend the Constitution. Deputy spokesman for the CEO, Javid Faisal, speaking at a press conference here stressed implementation of the political agreement on the national unity government, including change in the political system. \u201cThe aim of decentralizing the current centralized system is to devolve the power to people, so government services are delivered to people fast and quickly,\u201d he said. Based on the political agreement, a Loya Jirga, or grand assembly, was expected to be held within two years of the September 2014 election to amend the Constitution and create a prime ministerial post for Abdullah. Faisal said extreme authority in the center was one of the problems local governments faced, but it could be resolved if governors and local administrations were given more powers. \u201cGovernors currently do not have the authority of finance and employment, government operations would accelerate and local officials would become more responsible towards people if the system is changed,\u201d he said. He said the CEO was demanding the holding of a Loya Jirga on the Constitution in order people could decide about the creation of a prime minister post. He said the loya jirga would help clarify authorities and determine power and pave the way for effective solution to people\u2019s problems. \u201cTwo backgrounds are available for holding the Loya Jirga, the first is electoral reform that has been done and the second is parliamentary and district council election, a process under work,\u201d he said. **However, he said two committees had been created to work with the international community to resolve insecurity problem during elections** (para. 1-10).
