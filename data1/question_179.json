However, we have learned that some nuclear stocks and facilities were not in accordance with JCPOA limits on Implementation Day, but in anticipation the Joint Commission had earlier and secretly exempted them from the JCPOA limits. The exemptions and in one case, a loophole, involved the low enriched uranium (LEU) cap of 300 kilograms (kg), some of the near 20 percent LEU, the heavy water cap, and the number of large hot cells allowed to remain in Iran. One senior knowledgeable official stated that if the Joint Commission had not acted to create these exemptions, some of Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities would not have been in compliance with the JCPOA by Implementation Day.

To improve diplomatic relations. Despite a tentative warming in relations between Iran and the West, it seems unlikely that the US has much to gain from opening an embassy in Iran. Although it is true that Obama has normalised relations with Cuba, there are compelling circumstances (geography; a large Cuban-American population; open relations between Cuba and various US allies; Cuba not posing a military threat) which do not apply in the Iranian situation (Iran is far away from the US; the Iranian-American population is relatively small and politically insignificant; relations between Iran and key US allies, particularly Israel, are strained or hostile; Iran poses a potential military threat, and has acted against US interests in the Persian Gulf several times in the last three years). Trade between the US and Iran is minimal, and there are no pressing reasons for Obama to want to accelerate the current thaw. 2. To provide consular services to US citizens. There is little need for this - the US advises its citizens against travel to Iran, and consular services are provided via the Swiss embassy. Best estimates suggest that there are only a very small number (generally ranging from dozens to a few hundred) of US citizens in Iran at any one time (although these figures do not account for those with dual nationality). 3. To provide a base for intelligence gathering. However, a physical embassy or consulate would become an immediate target for Iranian counter-intelligence and would likely damage rather than enhance US intelligence-gathering operations in Iran. Although reliable evidence in this area is (for obvious reasons) hard to come by, there is reason to think that, while there are US intelligence networks in Iran, the US relies to a much greater extent on intelligence passed on from allies, particularly Israel. 4. A way for Obama to make life difficult for a potential Republican successor. Given his statements about Islam generally, and about tearing up the Iran nuclear deal in particular, it may be embarrassing for Donald Trump, were he to become president, to have to oversee a new US embassy in Iran. He would likely act to close it soon after coming to power. There is an outside chance, therefore, that Obama may seek to open an Iranian embassy or consulate in order to inconvenience Trump. This is, however, an extremely slim chance: an Iranian embassy would pose similar problems for Clinton as it would for Trump; and the risks to US standing abroad would likely outweigh the modest political benefits. At any rate, those who support Trump would likely approve of any action he took against Iran; closing a hypothetical embassy there would probably *gain* him political support domestically.  5. To act as a centre for the promotion of American culture and values in Iran. However, the nature of the Iranian regime makes the promotion of American culture and values at best very difficult, and at worst illegal. It is likely that the embassy would be the subject of intensive surveillance by the Iranians, and the identities of those going to events there would be known to the authorities. This, along with the repressive and controlling nature of the Iranian regime, and the general unpopularity of the United States in a country where it has been relentlessly demonised for more than three decades, would severely hamper the embassy's cultural power. Actively promoting American values in Iran (a country where the last US embassy was violently stormed and hostages were taken) would also put embassy staff at risk which, given that the Obama administration is highly sensitive to the security of its embassy staff following the murder of the US ambassador in Lybia, makes this possibility even more unlikely. Therefore, it seems that the chances of the Obama administration opening an embassy in Iran before October 18th are extremely slim."], [26372, "2016-06-22T11:10:46Z", [0.01], " Hawkish politicians and politically right-leaning populations attacked the Obama administration's renewal of ties with Cuba, promising to shut the embassy in Havana as well as attacking the Iranian nuclear deal.  In the run up to an election, there is no political capital to be gained for the Democrats in completing such an action before 18 October 2016. The gains would be minimal, and the potential costs would be great. With no incentive, this action is almost certain not to occur.

Soleimani and his deputies have helped create, organize, fund, arm, and deploy the dangerous Shia militias that dominate the Popular Mobilization Forces, which was created in June 2014 after the Islamic State overran large areas of Iraq. And Soleimani, Qods Force and IRGC officers have been providing more than just advice to the Shia militias.\nSome of these militias, such as the Badr Brigade, Hezbollah Brigades and Asaib al Haq, were created during the US occupation of Iraq, and are responsible for killing hundreds of US troops. Others, like Harakat al Nujaba and Shahid al Shuhada, were created after the Syrian civil war escalated. Other militias, such as the Imam Ali Brigade and Saraya al Khorasani were created after the Islamic State ran roughshod over northern, central, and western Iraq. Each of these militias were modeled after Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militia and organization that dominates inside Lebanon.\nThe Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) is led by several agents of Iran. Abu Mahdi al Muhandis, a former commander in the Badr Organization who was listed by the US government as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist in July 2009, directs the PMF\u2019s military operations. The US government described Muhandis, whose real name is Jamal Jaafar Mohammed, as \u201can advisor to Qassem Soleimani,\u201d the commander of the Qods Force, the external operations wing of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). In addition to directing the PMF, Muhandis is also said to direct the operations of the Imam Ali Brigade as well as command Hezbollah Brigades.

NB: previous rationale: 3/5/16:\n////\nIntend to start out w/ a low end forecast 5% for the following reasons: Hypothesis: extremely complex relationship between the two Countries that may or may not be, in a state of change. Here is why. A. One the one hand, from a Governmental top down perspective: On the higher probability side (>65%), the U.S. arguably needs & has made clear its effort to obtain Iran's support ( if not publicly, at least,indirectly) to resolve conflicts in Yemen, Syria & Iraq. The U.S. has an important interest in having Iran as a reliable Partner. A recent case in point, is the IS dilemma : note below. Additionally, the recent Iranian elections show, a potential change is in the offing. On the other hand, on the low probability side, Iran has complained in the past that Americans have failed to uphold their end of a so called JCPOA deal and, are more recently are now complicating the return of frozen assets during pre sanctions period, for example. Additionally, certain parts of the Iranian Government make every effort to claim, that in spite of the UN sanctions relief, in practice, actual doing business w/ Iran is still extremely difficult. B. **What Do Regular Americans Think About Iran Today**? The attached recent 17th & 22nd February 2016 Gallup polls ( Four Nations Top U.S.'s Greatest Enemy List & U.S. Views of Iran Remain Dismal After Nuclear Deal) are unmistakable signals from the American public to both political parties that care to read the tea leaves in the run up to the November Presidential election. Arguably, in spite of the recent UN ( & US supported ) sanctions relief provided by the present administration, present surveys do not appear, publicly at least, to have made a great deal of progress from the \"axis of evil\" comment made by George W. Bush some time ago. \n1)http://www.gallup.com/poll/189272/after-nuclear-deal-views-iran-remain-dismal.aspx\n2)http://www.gallup.com/poll/189503/four-nations-top-greatest-enemy-list.aspx C. What About The Present Administration, Hillary Clinton & the GOP nominee in the run up to the Presidential Election? The Obama Administration Policy along w/ the Secretary of State John Kerry have made their positions clear. Yet, HRC & the Ex-President Bill Clinton have a history w/ the Jewish electorate & its lobby in the U.S. ( both past & present) which is also clear. In substance, both are at odds with each other although, publicly the differences have been papered over/watered down. Note recent of points on this subject: Times of Israel : where Bill Clinton campaigning for Hillary Tells Florida Jewish Community She will priorize Isreal ties. http://www.timesofisrael.com/bill-clinton-tells-florida-jews-hillary-will-prioritize-israel-ties/ ; implications in this point relative for Iran relative to Israel are v debatable in the case of an HC Presidency. On the other hand, GOP has been thrown into a state of political chaos by DT. How an Iranian consulate/embassy effort by the present administration would play out, I am still working on. Suffice it to say, when viewed from the perspective of a relatively conservative voting base &, the present view Americans have on Iran in any event, makes it difficult not assign a higher probability ( >70%) that the present status quo remains. Note also, 2/5/16: **Haaretz **: Clinton swayed by Netanyhu over Iran sanctions which dove tails nicely w/ NYT article mentioned in the thread . \nhttp://www.haaretz.com/world-news/u-s-election-2016/1.717489?v=A3090502D0B66AE0234A553FC84B296D\n3) The Paris recent attacks raise the issue of whether Iran can be trusted to help defeat the IS. This has application to the US Government as well. NB: attached which nicely outlines why there is no easy answer that most look for; a) IS is viewed by Iran as a national security threat but, b) Iran, on the other hand, continues to provide ( at the very least indirect) support to avoid having Assad taken out of power in Syria http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/after-paris-can-iran-be-counted-help-defeat-isis-14386; b)http://europe.newsweek.com/should-we-trust-iran-ally-fight-against-isis-397448?rm=eu Conclusion: Question is a \"hot potato\". Present administration has taken a big risk w/ the American public. Put mildly, the most recent independent data shows Americans still v concerned about Iran. It is. Ore than arguable, in spite of the recent elections in Iran, that the voting public has major reservations on Iran. The GOP's fundamental disposition towards Iran is also v clear. Finally, HRC has attempted to play it both ways but, may soon be forced during the election process to take a clear stand on issue.

Here is why. A. One the one hand, from a Governmental top down perspective:  On the higher probability side (>65%), the  U.S. arguably needs & has made clear its effort to obtain Iran's support ( if not publicly, at least,indirectly) to resolve conflicts in Yemen, Syria & Iraq. The U.S. has an important interest in having Iran as a reliable Partner. A recent case in point, is the IS dilemma : note below. Additionally, the recent Iranian elections show, a potential change is in the offing.   On the other hand, on the low probability side, Iran has complained in the past that Americans have failed to uphold  their end of a so called JCPOA deal and, are more recently are now complicating the return of frozen assets during pre sanctions period, for example. Additionally, certain parts of the Iranian Government make every effort to claim, that in spite of the UN sanctions relief, in practice, actual doing business w/ Iran is still extremely difficult.   B. **What Do Regular Americans Think About Iran Today**?   The attached recent 17th & 22nd February 2016 Gallup polls ( Four Nations Top U.S.'s Greatest Enemy List & U.S. Views of Iran Remain Dismal After Nuclear Deal) are unmistakable signals from the American public to both political parties that care to read the tea leaves in the run up to the November Presidential election. Arguably, in spite of the recent UN ( & US supported ) sanctions relief provided by the present administration, present surveys do not appear, publicly at least, to have made a great deal of progress from the \"axis of evil\" comment made by George W. Bush some time ago.\n1)http://www.gallup.com/poll/189272/after-nuclear-deal-views-iran-remain-dismal.aspx\n2)http://www.gallup.com/poll/189503/four-nations-top-greatest-enemy-list.aspx C. What About The Present Administration, Hillary Clinton & the GOP nominee in the run up to the Presidential Election?  The Obama Administration Policy  along w/ the Secretary of State John Kerry have made their positions clear.  Yet, HRC & the Ex-President Bill Clinton have a history w/ the Jewish electorate & its lobby in the U.S. ( both past & present) which is also clear. In substance, both are at odds with each other although, publicly the differences have been papered over/watered down. Note recent of points on this subject: Times of Israel : where Bill Clinton campaigning for Hillary Tells Florida Jewish Community She will priorize Isreal ties. http://www.timesofisrael.com/bill-clinton-tells-florida-jews-hillary-will-prioritize-israel-ties/ ; implications in this point relative for Iran relative to Israel are v debatable  in the case of an HC Presidency. On the other hand, GOP has been thrown into a state of political chaos by DT. How an Iranian consulate/embassy effort by the present administration would play out, I am still working on. Suffice it to say, when viewed from the perspective of a relatively conservative voting base &, the present view Americans have on Iran in any event, makes it difficult not assign a higher probability ( >70%) that the present status quo remains.  Note also,  2/5/16: **Haaretz **: Clinton swayed by Netanyhu over Iran sanctions which dove tails nicely w/ NYT article mentioned in the thread . \nhttp://www.haaretz.com/world-news/u-s-election-2016/1.717489?v=A3090502D0B66AE0234A553FC84B296D\n3) The Paris recent attacks raise the issue of whether Iran can be trusted to help defeat the IS. This has application to the US Government as well. NB: attached which nicely outlines why there is no easy answer that most look for; a) IS is viewed by Iran as a national security threat but, b) Iran, on the other hand, continues to provide ( at the very least indirect) support to avoid having Assad taken out of power in Syria  http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/after-paris-can-iran-be-counted-help-defeat-isis-14386; b)http://europe.newsweek.com/should-we-trust-iran-ally-fight-against-isis-397448?rm=eu  Conclusion: Question is a \"hot potato\". Present administration has taken a big risk w/ the American public. Put mildly, the  most recent independent  data shows Americans still v concerned about Iran. It is. Ore than arguable, in spite of the recent elections in Iran, that the voting public has major reservations on Iran. The GOP's fundamental disposition towards Iran is also v clear. Finally, HRC has attempted to play it both ways but, may soon be forced during the election process to take a clear stand on issue.

On the one hand, opening an Embassy or consulate would be a powerful symbolic step for the Obama administration, and a signal that the administration's standing behind its signature foreign-policy achievement. On the other hand, as @Amir- points out the safety of the consulate is a key concern, particularly given the original reason for the break in diplomatic relations. Concern about the safety of diplomats has only been heightened as the death of Ambassador Christopher Stevens in Benghazi. The attack on the Saudi Embassy in Iran in January indicates that the Iranian government remains unable/unwilling to insure the safety of foreign diplomatic personnel, so it seems unlikely that the US Embassy or consulate were open in the near future. Additionally, remaining US sanctions would make it  difficult for the US government to buy/rent property in Tehran or hire local contractors or employees. I suppose OFAC could grant the state department a waiver, but it seems likely that the remaining sanctions will need to go first, and that will depend on Congress.

Thank you for contacting the U.S. Department of State. Bureau of Public Affairs Office of Public Engagement\".  I have been going over their website and found interesting language regarding how the U.S. communicates with Iran.  Since the JCPOA implementation the US and Iran have been communicating directly and seems to be effective.  This was stated in testimony by Thomas A. Shannon (Under Secretary for Political Affairs) 6 April 2016 in front of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , \"U.S. policy toward Iran must be calibrated to talk with Iran when it is in our interest while ensuring we address the threats to peace and security Iran continues to pose...It is up to Iran to decide the scope and pace of engagement\".  So it seems the US would want a consulate or embassy and Iran must decide if they want that close of a relationship.

Without access to any knowledge about anything, we must assume the present moment (Apr 2016) is a random time in the embassyless period. If an embassy is created by 18 Oct 2016, right now will have turned out to be in the last 1.3% of the embassyless period; and since now is a random time, the odds that it falls within the final 1.3% of the embassyless period must be 1.3%.  Another base rate may be gleaned from Cuba. The U.S. and Cuba severed relations in 1961, and an American embassy in Cuba was recreated only in 2015, so 54 years. Let's say that's the average amount of time. The U.S. and Iran fell out in 1979; even if we assume a very fat tailed-distribution with standard deviation of 10 years, that still makes for only 4% odds of an American embassy in Tehran a mere 37 years after the falling out.

The key point of note being that diplomatic relations were not restored until (and shortly after) the US Presidential election had concluded: in late November. The website of the Wilson Center includes the text of a then, top secret document  http://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/document/122544 that contains the following sentences, which appear to have some features in common with the present US outlook towards Iran: \"For a long time the Iraqi leadership had taken great pains to prepare for the restoration of diplomatic relations with the United States on 26 November 1984. The timing of the renewal of relations coincided with the reelection of President Reagan that according to some views will ensure some continuity in the foreign policy of the United States. Naturally, this policy also includes the Middle Eastern policy of the USA that had ended in repeated failures during the first term of Reagan\u2019s presidency in Lebanon and brought the Camp David process to a deadlock. Therefore the republican government of the United States had to \u201cfreeze\u201d its political activities in the Middle East in the year of the election so that it could erase the past of several blunders committed by the Reagan administration in the region. However, from the beginning of 1984 it became clear even in this \u201cstate of rest\u201d that American foreign policy showed more \u201cunderstanding\u201d towards the Iraqi position both officially and through the press. This process eventually led to the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries.\" One can attempt to draw numerous parallels with the present situation vis a vis Iran....- -but the looming prospect of a US presidential election surely towers over all else.

Westerners fail to appreciate how important  principles of  Islam are to  Muslims and how certain aspects Western offensive to them  I am a Christian Unitarian  and converse easily with Muslims - but I still cannot get right into the 'cultural' aspects of Islam I've wandered all over the place today - but  I would conclude that in an election year  there is ZERO chance of  an American administration agreeing to  establish diplomatic relations with Iran. Understanding one another is a long way away.
