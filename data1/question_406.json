The bankers will have done pre-marketing and should (may) have a reasonable idea on demand at different valuations, but won't know for certain until the orders come in.

These were the potential earnings multiple of recent tech companies IPOs:\nFacebook - 19.4\nTwilio - 18.3\nTwitter - 13.0\nAlibaba - 12.7 Snap Inc faces several major obstacles as a business, which may temper investor expectations:\n1) It's main business relies heavily on Snapchat's ad-driven revenue\n2) Snap competes directly with Facebook, which added Instagram Stories feature in August 2016 that provides a similar vanishing 24 hr image service\n3) Snap users spend an average of 10 min/d on the site. Facebook claims Instagram users spend 20 min/d (though a Cantor Fitzgerald analysis suggests it is 6 min/d - the truth is likely somewhere in between).\n4) Snap recently rebranded itself as a \"camera company\" and selling camera-enabled sunglasses. But at $129.99 I don't see it moving out of a niche market. Facebook announced in Nov 2016 that it would focus on becoming a \"video-first\" company in direct competition to the Snap Spectacles.\n5) Perhaps most importantly, the Snap IPO is strongly considering offering only class A (non-voting) shares. This may result in the IPO trading at a discount since it means the company's success will depend entirely on current management's ability to counter its rivals' (e.g. Facebook) strategies. Historically, non-voting shares trade at a slight discount vs. voting shares (mean discount of -2.9%) but Facebook's size & nimbleness, I believe this discount will likely be larger. Therefore, I predict the most likely first day IPO valuation will be:\n$1 billion (predicted 2017 earnings) x 15.9 (mean future earnings multiple from above) x 0.97 (less historic 3% discount) = $15.4 billion https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2016-10-07/snapchat-ipo-5-charts-explaining-why-it-s-worth-25-billion\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/a-rivals-shadow-looms-over-snapchat-ipo-1486296005?tesla=y\nhttps://qz.com/901904/will-snapchat-snap-investors-get-voting-rights-with-their-ipo-shares/"], [14286, "2017-02-05T15:20:32Z", [0.01, 0.85, 0.13, 0.01], ""], [283, "2017-02-05T14:49:18Z", [0.54, 0.44, 0.02, 0.0], "Basically following Raahul_Kumar.
