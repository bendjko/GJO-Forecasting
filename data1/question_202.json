This is a reform over previous practice when the Security Council would just come up with its own candidates. \u201cOne or two more candidates may come forward as this process could go into October and November but there is an understanding with the Council that the candidates would be called in before the General Assembly to make presentations before the Council can vote on them\u201d, Lykketof told The Lancet. \u201cThis is the first time in the UN's history that we've an open and transparent process and this has influenced the straw polls in the Council. The Council has ten elected members, as well as the five permanent members, and they are working to influence them. Yes, the P5 has the deciding power and can turn down candidates but even strong countries need friends and allies\u201d, Lykketof said.\nThe final choice seems to hinge on Russia, which has made clear it would like to manage the process when it holds the presidency of the Security Council in October. Russia has been at loggerheads with the USA on recent global crises such as Syria and Moscow's annexation of Crimea. \u201cThe question is: what is Russia's game if indeed it voted \u2018discourage\u2019 against Guterres\u201d, an international official told The Lancet. \u201cAre they being tactical or strategic? Are they looking for a bargaining chip or looking to play a blocking game related to the UN or something completely different? I suspect only [Russian President Vladimir] Putin knows.

Yvonne Terlingen, who is on the steering committee of the campaign, welcomed what she called the \u201cunprecedented\u201d public interest in the process.

However, it is not certain that the Russians would accept Georgieva, who is also the vice-president of the European commission, which has been enforcing sanctions on Russia for the annexation of Crimea and intervention in eastern Ukraine.

Georgieva, a former World Bank economist, would not be assured of Paris\u2019s support.  \"The UK has also been lukewarm about her late run, fearing it would divert support from Guterres and thereby take pressure off Moscow to accept the Portuguese leader, who has wide support in the general assembly. \"The [Bulgarian] prime minister was quoted in the Sofia news agency as saying: \u201cBecause of the unspoken attitudes there, it would be good if the candidate is a woman and from eastern Europe.

That said, I'd be surprised if the issue is resolved before the US presidential elections. The Russians want to negotiate - they won't support Georgieva (nor Guteres) just like that. I suppose they will be happy with either (i) a friendly Secretary General (friendlier than Georgieva), or (ii) even better, a high-ranking position in the UN leadership structures. The Obama administration is not in a position to agree on neither now - the Democrats have been criticizing Trump for his willingness to cut deals with Russia, they can't be seen doing the same (even though eventually a deal will be needed).  Putin is not in a big rush either - if Trump wins, he may hope for a better deal, and if Clinton wins, the situation won't be worse than now, when sparks are flying over Syria.  This theory leads to the testable proposition that every candidate will be vetoed by a P5 member until Nov 8. I wonder  if Georgieva's name will be included already in the next straw poll (Oct 5).  Even if vetoed, it's interesting to see if she goes quickly to the top 3 spots. In fact, one question to the forum: I am assuming that a veto from a P5 member in one of the October straw poll does not automatically disqualify the candidate - if everyone is vetoed, the straw polls will simply continue until someone is not vetoed. Is this correct? In some articles it's implied that one veto means it's over for that candidate. If that's true, however, it means that (i) everything will be decided on Oct 5, or (ii) if everyone is vetoed, new candidates will have to be nominated.

(She has worked in Moscow in the past when she was with the World Bank, so someone there knows her).  And yet...The rumor about Hungary, Croatia, and Latvia nominating Georgieva (with the support from Germany) is a bit odd. Croatia has parliamentary elections today, so presumably this is not on the top of their list. And since when Hungary's Orban is so chummy with Germany?  That said, an eventual nomination of Georgieva - by Bulgaria or others - has now a non-trivial chance. And such a nomination will be popular as it ticks all boxes (an experienced Eastern European woman). The key, though, is in Russia's hands - it will have to make its choice between Guteres and Georguieva.   A final thought why Russia looks so lukewarm to Georgieva's candidacy: If they were vetoing Guteres indeed, this was probably with the objective to bargain with the West and get something in exchange for their eventual go-along. Now Georgieva will deprive them of any leverage: how can Russia veto an experienced female candidate from Eastern Europe after all their support for exactly such a profile? And if they do it anyway, they have to approve Guteres - vetoing both will be seen as an unprincipled power play.

He's the only one without a negative vote, which suggests none of the permanent five are currently inclined to veto him. However, there will be several more straw polls before the end October deadline. If one ignores all candidates who did not receive net positive votes, the original 12 reduce to 8, of which 3 are women. Leading them is Irina Bokova, with 9 positive and 4 negative, which suggests she may be vetoed for being too sympathetic to Russia, even though she is already in the UN as Director General of UNESCO. Next are Helen Clark ( 8 positive, 5 negative) and Susanna Malcorra (7 positive, 4 negative) who could also be vetoed for not being East European. From the remaining men. Danilo Turk, former President of Slovenia, placed second with 11 positive, 2 negative. The other three males are from Eastern Europe - Srgjan Kerim of Macedonia (9 positive, 5 negative), Vuk Jeremic of Serbia (9 positive, 5 negative) and Miroslav Lajcak of Slovakia (7 positive, 3 negative). If all were rated equally, there would be a 3 out of 8 chance that a woman would be chosen.  However, if one takes into account the total net votes of the top 8, 33 went to men against 11 to women, reducing the probability to 25%. It could even be lower if it turns out that Guterres is the only candidate acceptable to all of the P5.

The US will back Portugal because of the importance of  the US base in the Azores. Britain will back Portugal candidate due long standing treaty relationship that could also help with all things Brexistential.  May not the moment for an Eastern European or female secretary-general.

A convention that successive SGs should be drawn from different geographical areas has led to speculation that a candidate from the Eastern European group might be a popular choice since no individual from this area has been SG before (there are also arguments about the rising geopolitical and economic importance of this region): 3/5 female candidates are from Eastern Europe; 5/6 male candidates are from this area. On the face of it, therefore, if an Eastern European SG is chosen, then a male candidate would be marginally more likely (83% to 60%). However, the issue of selecting an Eastern European SG is complicated by the role of Russia - Russia is likely to veto (or at least to agitate against) an SG who is known to favour Ukraine. Similarly, western countries are likely not to vote for (and may even veto) a candidate who is known to be too pro-Russian. This may rule out several of the female candidates: Natalia Gherman is Moldovan, and has expressed some sympathy with Ukraine, and opposition to greater integration of Moldova and Russia (Moldova also faces an ongoing crisis over the Russian-backed, break-away republic of Transnistria). Irina Bokova, on the other hand, is a Bulgarian who is known to have close personal links to the Kremlin, and therefore risks opposition from the anti-Russia consensus. The most likely Eastern European woman to win the appointment, therefore, is Vesna Pusic - is a Croat who has spoken out about mending relations with Russia; however, she is also a prominent advocate of LGBT rights (where she is clearly not in line with the Kremlin). She would seem to be a good compromise candidate. If we continue to run with the Eastern European theory, then we need to evaluate the chances of Pusic against the 5 Eastern European men who are also in the running: the Serbian, Montenegrin, and Macedonian candidates are all seen as being, to varying degrees, close to Russia. The Slovakian candidate also has some links to the Kremlin, and in recent months has led Slovak negotiations with Russia in spite of EU sanctions. The Slovenian candidate has an honourary doctorate from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, and is popular in the Russian press; however, he may be seen as the best male compromise candidate between Russia and the West, not least because of his track record in promoting rapprochement with Russia. Therefore, if the Eastern-European hypothesis is to be given any weight, even though EE men outnumber EE women, the political backgrounds of those candidates certainly do not rule out a female winner. I'd say the chances are 50/50 at present. However, the EE hypothesis may be a red herring - the political implications (concerning Russia) of selecting an EE SG are significant, and it may be that an EE appointment would be too controversial for that reason. Of those candidates who are not from the EE group, 2 are women (from Argentina and New Zealand), and one is male (from Portugal), giving a 66% chance that a woman will win. Although the Portugese candidate was heavily tipped back in April, he has served, in the past, as president of the Socialist International - while it is not unheard of, it is unusual for a UN SG to be selected who has such clear and potentially polarising political views. His momentum seems to have waned in recent weeks. The (female) Argentine candidate has spoken out explicitly and prominently about the return of the Falkland/Malvinas Islands to Argentina. Again, it would be unusual for a candidate to be selected who has intervened in such a way in an ongoing and unresolved international conflict (especially in one that involves a NATO member). Of the non-EE candidates, therefore, Helen Clark of New Zealand looks like a front-runner - she is a political moderate, who has maintained good relations with both China (where she oversaw the negotiation of a free trade treaty - she is said to have strong Chinese support for this reason) and the West. For these reasons, she looks like a strong, compromise candidate. It is also worth noting that there has never been a SG from Australia or NZ (although there have been several from the Asia-Pacific group of which Au and NZ are members). If there an EE candidate wins, therefore, it seems like a straight contest between a man and a woman; if a non-EE candidate wins, it seems the front runner is female. This would seem to suggest a 66% likelihood of a women winning the contest at this stage."], [23006, "2016-06-22T03:48:28Z", [0.75], ""], [368, "2016-06-21T17:18:51Z", [0.85], ""], [691, "2016-06-21T11:34:28Z", [0.68], ""], [11080, "2016-06-21T10:09:55Z", [0.68], ""], [4961, "2016-06-21T07:26:49Z", [0.51], "Outside case: my assumptions are that it will be an official candidate and that it will be someone from the Eastern European Group (EEG).
