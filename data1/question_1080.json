Using the Early Warning project Risk assessment (which is at 5.9 percent). I\u2019m going to initially downgrade my forecast to a solid 17% to start. However, this is where things start to get really interesting. In the past year, the killings that Boko Haram have started have decreased from 118 events to 87 between the time frames of April 1st, 2017 to March 31st 2018 and January 1st, 2018 to December 31st, 2018 respectively.  Using that as the backbone, I\u2019m going to drop the percentage by another 5 percent to 12 percent. Here is where I personally got tied up in the nuances of what previous decisions have been made by the good judgement open. In a previous decision made by the GJO there were over 1000 deaths of civilians in Nigeria, however only approximately 830 were killed by Boko Haram, therefore it was not a genocide (I do not agree, but that is irrelevant in this case). Last year (2018), only approximately 400 were killed by Boko Haram. That begs the question, why? Well I do not have an exact answer nor do I believe in having a singular reason in causality.  So what would it take for the killings to be expanded again. Boko Haram would have to have more land control. And to win more territory in the North East Corner of Nigeria, which activity has been dying down in for the past year and a half. Given the numbers, and the lack of leadership by Boko Haram, the final percentage will be at 6.5 percent probability of a genocide in Nigeria. \n"], [8318, "2019-02-04T00:32:46Z", [0.41], ""], [12591, "2019-02-03T19:40:33Z", [0.15], ""], [57628, "2019-02-01T18:40:31Z", [0.12], "This is where it finally gets a little more interesting. In Nigeria, it is actually really really possible for a genocide to happen. But let\u2019s really break this down from the beginning. We\u2019re going to establish a base rate using the data from ACLEDDATA. Then we\u2019re going to uptick the probability for it to happen. Cool? Cool.  BaseRate:\nIn 2018, 1020 Civilians were killed in Nigeria by government or state led forces. By the definition used by the EarlyWarning project and the GoodJudgment open, their definition of genocide there needs to be 1000 or more deaths. The question becomes, is this rate sustainable and are these deaths organized with a specific malicious intent towards a specific group of people. Data Gathered Courtesy of ACLEDDATA\nSorting Through Data: \nSince there is enough numbers to actually dig into this. We need to go through and filter through a lot of the data. I am looking for a consistent people group that is being targeted by a specific actor. Also, I\u2019m feeling a little lazy and I really don\u2019t feel like reading through hundreds of cells, so, I am going to do something a little different. According to a research paper called Predicting Violence within Genocide: A model of Elite Competition by Omar McDoom, areas that are segregated naturally or by force are by much more likely to experience a genocide than diverse communities. So here is what I am going to do, let\u2019s take a look at a map that shows the distribution of the attacks on civilians.  There are a couple of places that appear to be hot zones for civilians being killed are mostly by Boko Haram. However, I do not have an exact number for how many they killed. Also it appears that my idea to cut down on the work really was not a good idea. But I will keep it in my mind for a later time. So as of right now. I\u2019m not sure if this will be considered a genocide.  Boko Haram:\nNow the question becomes, is Boko Haram  considered a genocide according the GJO. After reading through some past decisions made by the GJO it can be considered a genocide if all the violence is perpetrated by a singular group. So it\u2019s time to filter through some more data.  According to ACLED Data, there were 437 people killed by Boko Haram in 2018 in the spreadsheet that I created. Which is a smaller than the year before which is of 850 people being killed during the previous time period. Which means, I am scaling down my prediction of everything quite a bit.  Unless, we can figure out the factors that made Boko Haram stop. Or we can go through and manage all the states forces.  There is a count of 87 of events that happened in 2018. And there are 118 data points between April 2017 to April 2018. The reason for this. I am not sure of it yet. Or vaguely sure. But in that lies the key to this question.
