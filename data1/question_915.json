Unlike the previous demonstration at the beginning of June, this one went off peacefully, thanks to a UN- and AU-brokered agreement between the government and opposition. Jeune Afrique (in French) notes that the demands of the demonstrators extended beyond the election to include denunciations of the current government, calls for economic reform, and an end to corruption. These types of widespread demonstrations in the run up to presidential elections in Africa are commonplace, and the fact that outside agencies were able to get the government to show flexibility and restraint bodes well for a peaceful outcome.Nevertheless, given the volatility of country,the situation warrants continued monitoring. http://www.jeuneafrique.com/575299/politique/mali-plusieurs-milliers-de-manifestants-defilent-a-bamako-pour-reclamer-des-elections-transparentes/"], [691, "2018-06-08T12:56:11Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2018-06-04T11:25:28Z", [0.0], ""], [593, "2018-06-02T19:38:04Z", [0.25], ""], [172, "2018-06-01T02:06:15Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2018-05-31T17:51:04Z", [0.0], ""], [48709, "2018-05-30T01:51:18Z", [0.0], "The contry is to happy no ? \ud83d\udc2c"], [691, "2018-05-28T16:14:33Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2018-05-26T12:56:25Z", [0.0], ""], [172, "2018-05-26T00:34:43Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2018-05-24T19:32:20Z", [0.0], ""], [23006, "2018-05-24T11:17:42Z", [0.0], ""], [32539, "2018-05-24T02:58:12Z", [0.12], ""], [691, "2018-05-22T14:35:54Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2018-05-17T14:23:48Z", [0.0], ""], [172, "2018-05-16T22:27:23Z", [0.0], ""], [50568, "2018-05-14T16:51:19Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2018-05-14T12:24:32Z", [0.0], ""], [1333, "2018-05-13T15:41:15Z", [0.05], ""], [691, "2018-05-12T12:27:17Z", [0.0], ""], [3429, "2018-05-11T18:58:15Z", [0.0], "Not likely."], [172, "2018-05-10T00:57:24Z", [0.0], ""], [33887, "2018-05-09T17:52:30Z", [0.0], ""], [29033, "2018-05-05T22:15:33Z", [0.06], "Two attacks attributed to Fulani groups affiliated with IS in northern Mali killed 17, and 47 respectively in the past weeks as tensions rise between the Fulani and the Tuaregs who are assisting French forces fighting against extremists.

The report focuses on varieties of \u201cworst case\u201d scenarios in Mali not because they are highly likely\u2014 these are in fact very low probability events\u2014but because their impact would be extreme. We selected Mali for this study because our annual global risk assessment has consistently placed it in the top 10% of countries, ranking 9th, 13th, and 8th out of 162 in 2014, 2015, and 2016, respectively. The report was informed by interviews with 93 interlocutors from the Malian government, armed groups, civil society, and domestic non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Mali as well as country experts working in government and NGOs internationally. This report is one of the components of the Early Warning Project, which includes both quantitative and qualitative assessments of atrocity risk. Virtually every study on the subject has identified early warning as a critical component of mass atrocity prevention, determining that intervention is more likely to be successful the earlier it begins. This report is the third in a series of deep-dive qualitative assessments designed to assist policymakers, NGOs, and members of civil society in understanding the atrocity dynamics particular to the country in question and recommending preventative actions.\" https://www.ushmm.org/confront-genocide/cases/mali"], [1333, "2018-04-29T09:44:39Z", [0.02], ""], [691, "2018-04-25T22:37:11Z", [0.0], ""], [172, "2018-04-20T00:59:10Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2018-04-19T13:44:39Z", [0.0], ""], [12302, "2018-04-19T05:54:40Z", [0.01], ""], [50270, "2018-04-16T23:00:24Z", [0.05], ""], [691, "2018-04-16T16:13:26Z", [0.0], ""], [32100, "2018-04-16T16:12:14Z", [0.02], ""], [46339, "2018-04-15T17:57:43Z", [0.5], ""], [55036, "2018-04-15T13:57:20Z", [0.05], ""], [57892, "2018-04-14T16:56:03Z", [0.35], ""], [172, "2018-04-13T01:48:08Z", [0.0], ""], [1333, "2018-04-12T15:35:29Z", [0.01], ""], [54077, "2018-04-12T11:27:23Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2018-04-11T16:48:13Z", [0.0], ""], [36147, "2018-04-10T11:30:19Z", [0.04], ""], [691, "2018-04-09T12:06:29Z", [0.0], ""], [29980, "2018-04-08T19:42:27Z", [0.99], ""], [28166, "2018-04-07T20:51:37Z", [0.01], ""], [40702, "2018-04-07T04:33:38Z", [0.0], ""], [5018, "2018-04-07T01:46:23Z", [0.05], ""], [29054, "2018-04-06T21:55:45Z", [0.0], ""], [172, "2018-04-06T00:16:17Z", [0.0], ""], [11805, "2018-04-05T19:24:34Z", [0.77], ""], [56997, "2018-04-05T12:33:47Z", [0.05], ""], [36736, "2018-04-04T20:20:20Z", [0.0], ""], [57175, "2018-04-04T18:14:56Z", [0.02], ""], [56265, "2018-04-04T17:54:32Z", [0.01], ""], [691, "2018-04-04T12:42:54Z", [0.0], ""], [28166, "2018-04-04T09:43:12Z", [0.03], ""], [15196, "2018-04-04T03:10:31Z", [0.0], ""], [39381, "2018-04-03T18:16:07Z", [0.25], ""], [39381, "2018-04-03T18:15:40Z", [0.32], ""], [57308, "2018-04-03T16:32:03Z", [0.02], ""], [57527, "2018-04-03T16:15:09Z", [0.08], ""], [691, "2018-04-03T12:49:38Z", [0.0], ""], [1333, "2018-04-02T22:33:47Z", [0.0], ""]]}
