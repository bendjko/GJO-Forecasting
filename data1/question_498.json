In total there have been 6,970 days since 1990 for the VIX to trade. That is a base rate probability of 8.34% (581/6,970). So, there is an 8.34% probability that the VIX will trade at 30 or higher on a given day. Some more stats, in the last 365 trading days, the VIX has had 0 days at 30 or higher. In the last 730 trading days (2 years), the VIX has had 4 trading days of 30 or higher. Currently the VIX stands at 9.14% at the time of this writing. It's important to note that the VIX has never gone from 9 to 30 over night. It always takes time for the VIX to accelerate. When the VIX was at its most recent 30 reading in August 2015, the VIX trough before the run up to 30 was 13. It took 7 days for the VIX to reach 30 from 13. In the meantime, the S&P 500 dropped 8.6%. Before that, in 2011, the second to last time the VIX went to 30, it took 24 days for the VIX to go from 15 (lowest point before the uptrend) to reach 30. In that time the S&P 500 lost 10.4% in value. Both times the VIX 30 day average before it broker higher was 13.4 (2015) and 19 (2011). Going back further through the data follows similar statistics to 2011 data in terms of length of time to go from a relatively low VIX (e.g. 13) to 30, and the magnitude of the drop in the S&P 500. The only way the vix will go to 30 is if the S&P 500 drops. And usually the S&P 500 must drop pretty significantly approx. 5%+ for the VIX to reach 30. To forecast we must first estimate the probability that the S&P 500 will drop about 5% between now and Jan 1, 2018. There are 38 trading days between now and then. This year has been relatively, and eerily, quiet. To most people that means that a drop is imminent. However, given the strong earnings data, GDP growth, and balance sheets of companies, plus low interest rates and relative ease of capital, my estimate of the likelihood of a large drop due to a surprise is relatively low. Now surprises can come from anywhere, and don't show themselves before they happen (e.g. black swan events). However, I believe more of the same will continue for the S&P 500 through the remainder of the year as investors have generally been sanguine to surprises in the news. Investors have generally been complacent this year given generally strong economic data and the lack of stronger opportunities outside the stock market. Additionally, both December and November have generally been stronger months for the S&P 500 (Yardeni research). The S&P 500, since 1990 has had 6,970 trading days. On average, there is a 23% chance the S&P 500 will drop 50 basis points. And a 12% chance it will drop 1.0%. We have had four 1% or greater drops this year. And these have not pushed the meter much past 16 on the VIX. So given the relative amount of complacency in the market, the short number of days left to trade (38 days), the amount of time and magnitude of a price drop for the VIX to spike from a low of 13 to a high of 30, (lowest 7 days) which requires repeated drops in the S&P 500 to get there, I don't see a high likelihood of a VIX spiking above 30 before Jan 2018. *** UPDATE: We now have 8 trading days left. It is highly unlikely that even if we get a sever drop in the S&P 500 that it would push the vix to 30 over the next 8 days. I give this a 1% probability of happening. ***UPDATE: With just one trading day left, it is impossible.

As of September 21, the year-to-date standard deviation of S&P 500 daily returns has been 0.45 percent, the lowest level since 1965 on an annual basis. Intraday volatility is also low. As the chart below indicates, estimates of realized volatility are currently around 6 percent in annualized units, near the minimum of the historical distribution. The chart also reports the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX), a market-based measure of implied volatility over a one-month horizon from forward-looking S&P 500 index option prices. Despite a backdrop with high political uncertainty (for example, as measured by Baker, Bloom, and Davis\u2019s economic policy uncertainty index), the VIX is currently around 9-10 percent after hovering near all-time lows for much of 2017.  The Low Volatility Puzzle: Are Investors Complacent? Common View: Today Is Abnormal and Current Stock Market Volatility Is a Concern \nAside from the FOMC minutes excerpt above, other commentators (for example, see Jeffrey Frankel\u2019s recent blog post) have raised concerns about the low level of stock market volatility, especially given the low level of interest rates, which many associate with investors\u2019 increased willingness to take on risk (or reach for yield). Based on similarities to the low volatility environment before the financial crisis, some suggest that investor complacency may contribute to a major correction in equity markets when volatility returns to a \u201cnormal\u201d level.  One argument is based on the simple idea that stock market volatility will revert to its historical mean, with equity valuations dropping while volatility \u201ccorrects.\u201d In the past, increases in volatility have been negatively correlated with stock market returns. As the chart below shows, if the VIX were to return to a \u201cnormal\u201d level closer to its average of around 20 percent since 1990, the S&P 500 index might be expected to decline by 5-10 percent.  The Low Volatility Puzzle: Are Investors Complacent? While this sounds like a potential warning sign, there are two limitations to the simple mean reversion argument. First, the assumed mean for the VIX is based on a statistical analysis of historical patterns. If the post-crisis regime is different, the \u201ccorrect\u201d level for the VIX may have changed. Second, even if the mean remains the same, the speed of mean reversion is a key aspect of the risk profile. An increase in the VIX from 10 percent to 20 percent has different implications if the move happens over one week versus one year.  In contrast to mean reversion, the macro-finance literature has raised a more nuanced argument for why low volatility may lead to a buildup of risks to financial stability. In Brunnermeier and Sannikov (2014) and Adrian and Shin (2013) , decreased volatility during business cycle expansions may lead to lower value-at-risk constraints for investors as well as lower margin and collateral requirements. If investors respond by increasing leverage, small shocks to asset prices may suddenly make constraints bind, which can force investors to sell assets, raise volatility, and tighten constraints further. This feedback loop creates risk endogenously, meaning that low volatility in itself can be a catalyst for high future volatility.  Alternative View: Yesterday Was Abnormal and Current Stock Market Volatility Is Not a Concern \nTo assess the low level of volatility further, it is useful to think about the fundamental sources of stock market volatility that determine its level of mean reversion. According to asset pricing theory, stock prices are equal to the expected value of discounted dividends. As a result, stock price volatility results from either dividend volatility or time-variation in the discount rate used to compute the net present value of dividends.  As discussed in Robert Shiller\u2019s Nobel Prize lecture , the original puzzle in financial economics was why stock prices are so volatile relative to dividends. According to the Gordon growth formula, stock prices and dividends should have the same volatility. In the data, however, stock prices are significantly more volatile than dividends. Since the 1950s, stock prices have exhibited 16 percent annualized volatility. That is almost 10 percentage points higher than the \u201cfundamental\u201d volatility of dividends, which has been closer to 7 percent (for example, see Shiller\u2019s annual data).  Shiller interpreted these results as evidence that stock prices were inefficient, with investors potentially succumbing to animal spirits, or \u201cwaves of optimism and pessimism,\u201d to explain the large variation in stock prices (see John Cochrane\u2019s discussion of this view in a Grumpy Economist blog post) . Importantly, however, Shiller\u2019s analysis assumed a constant discount rate for computing net present values. Subsequent work provided evidence against this assumption. Time-varying discount rates are now a standard feature of asset pricing models that can explain the excess volatility of stock prices relative to dividends (see Discount Rates by Cochrane or Monika Piazzesi\u2019s summary of related asset pricing research).  As shown in the previous chart, today\u2019s realized volatility is about 6-7 percent. This level is what one would have originally predicted using the Gordon growth formula, suggesting that the low volatility puzzle is perhaps less puzzling than originally thought. Alternatively, if one subscribes to the more recent asset pricing theories, it appears that current volatility is either abnormally low or that discount rate variation has somehow been dampened, leading us back to concerns about investor complacency.  Evidence on Complacency from the Volatility Risk Premium \nTaking the level of realized volatility as given, one way to gauge investor complacency is through the expected returns that investors demand for selling options. To that end, we decompose the VIX into a one-month volatility forecast and a one-month volatility risk premium using an updated model from Van Tassel and Vogt 2016 (strictly speaking, we estimate the variance risk premium, which is the expected return for receiving the fixed leg in variance swaps over a one-month horizon). The volatility risk premium, plotted in the chart below, represents the time-varying expected return from selling insurance on stock market volatility. The expected returns are positive, reflecting the fact that investors demand compensation for an investment that suffers losses in bad economic states of the world. As noted above, stock prices tend to go down when volatility goes up.  If investors are compressing implied volatility by selling options, we should see this reflected in the estimated volatility risk premium. In the model, we estimate the volatility risk premium to be 0.64 percent as of September 2017. This estimate is below the 2 percent historical average of the volatility risk premium. It also contrasts with the 1 percent upper bound for the volatility risk premium that one can obtain by squaring the VIX, given the VIX\u2019s current level of about 10 percent. Beyond the current level, we can also observe that the volatility risk premium has been below its long-run mean and has exhibited less volatility since around 2012. While low realized volatility may be consistent with the prediction from the Gordon growth model, the volatility risk premium appears to be low both in absolute terms and relative to its historical norm, which may suggest complacency.  The Low Volatility Puzzle: Are Investors Complacent? Are Investors Complacent? The Evidence Is Mixed \nWhile the low volatility risk premium provides some evidence of complacency, we find the concerns based on the VIX mean reversion argument to be limited. First, it is unclear whether the long-run mean of the VIX is changing over time, especially in the context of the excess volatility puzzle documented by Shiller. Second, while the current level of the VIX is low, it is difficult to pinpoint the horizon over which the VIX may increase (for example, see the large trade in VIX options this July whose payoff expired out of the money in October). An open question is whether investors understand that volatility may be higher in the future. We explore this issue in our next post.   fed ny research\ndoes not reflect the position of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.

In total there have been 6,970 days since 1990 for the VIX to trade. That is a base rate probability of 8.34% (581/6,970). So, there is an 8.34% probability that the VIX will trade at 30 or higher on a given day. Some more stats, in the last 365 trading days, the VIX has had 0 days at 30 or higher. In the last 730 trading days (2 years), the VIX has had 4 trading days of 30 or higher. Currently the VIX stands at 9.14% at the time of this writing.  It's important to note that the VIX has never gone from 9 to 30 over night. It always takes time for the VIX to accelerate. When the VIX was at its most recent 30 reading in August 2015, the VIX trough before the run up to 30 was 13. It took 7 days for the VIX to reach 30 from 13. In the meantime, the S&P 500 dropped 8.6%.  Before that, in 2011, the second to last time the VIX went to 30, it took 24 days for the VIX to go from 15 (lowest point before the uptrend) to reach 30. In that time the S&P 500 lost 10.4% in value. Both times the VIX 30 day average before it broker higher was 13.4 (2015) and 19 (2011). Going back further through the data follows similar statistics to 2011 data in terms of length of time to go from a relatively low VIX (e.g. 13) to 30, and the magnitude of the drop in the S&P 500. The only way the vix will go to 30 is if the S&P 500 drops. And usually the S&P 500 must drop pretty significantly approx. 5%+ for the VIX to reach 30. To forecast we must first estimate the probability that the S&P 500 will drop about 5% between now and Jan 1, 2018. There are 38 trading days between now and then. This year has been relatively, and eerily, quiet. To most people that means that a drop is imminent. However, given the strong earnings data, GDP growth, and balance sheets of companies, plus low interest rates and relative ease of capital, my estimate of the likelihood of a large drop due to a surprise is relatively low. Now surprises can come from anywhere, and don't show themselves before they happen (e.g. black swan events). However, I believe more of the same will continue for the S&P 500 through the remainder of the year as investors have generally been sanguine to surprises in the news. Investors have generally been complacent this year given generally strong economic data and the lack of stronger  opportunities outside the stock market. Additionally, both December and November have generally been stronger months for the S&P 500 (Yardeni research). The S&P 500, since 1990 has had 6,970 trading days. On average, there is a 23% chance the S&P 500 will drop 50 basis points. And a 12% chance it will drop 1.0%. We have had four 1% or greater drops this year. And these have not pushed the meter much past 16 on the VIX. So given the relative amount of complacency in the market, the short number of days left to trade (38 days), the amount of time and magnitude of a price drop for the VIX to spike from a low of 13 to a high of 30, (lowest 7 days) which requires repeated drops in the S&P 500 to get there, I don't see a high likelihood of a VIX spiking above 30 before Jan 2018."], [31756, "2017-11-03T19:47:49Z", [0.04], ""], [368, "2017-11-03T17:34:11Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-11-03T15:17:58Z", [0.0], ""], [29568, "2017-11-03T12:58:58Z", [0.02], ""], [691, "2017-11-02T17:52:17Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-11-02T17:33:00Z", [0.0], ""], [23234, "2017-11-01T21:59:43Z", [0.08], ""], [368, "2017-11-01T21:59:33Z", [0.0], ""], [20544, "2017-11-01T21:16:02Z", [0.07], ""], [691, "2017-11-01T16:36:57Z", [0.0], ""], [15196, "2017-11-01T03:10:31Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-10-31T22:27:30Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-10-31T18:48:22Z", [0.0], ""], [6303, "2017-10-31T03:10:30Z", [0.1], "Based on general news and GJP consensus."], [368, "2017-10-30T22:07:55Z", [0.0], ""], [27367, "2017-10-29T19:03:32Z", [0.18], ""], [368, "2017-10-29T17:40:40Z", [0.0], ""], [23409, "2017-10-29T15:10:35Z", [0.12], ""], [691, "2017-10-29T12:35:03Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2017-10-29T01:54:34Z", [0.0], ""], [41011, "2017-10-28T13:04:48Z", [0.0], ""], [33818, "2017-10-27T20:44:52Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-10-27T20:25:03Z", [0.0], ""], [38525, "2017-10-27T15:55:20Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-10-27T13:14:34Z", [0.01], ""], [38223, "2017-10-26T22:28:05Z", [0.02], "it is about 10 now and there are only 2 months to go."], [691, "2017-10-26T20:00:26Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2017-10-26T18:14:10Z", [0.0], ""], [31410, "2017-10-26T17:52:17Z", [0.08], "reducing the prob as we move into year end.

Since it is calculated using out-of-money puts/calls of SPX, it is the collective judgement of investors. The VIX is currently under 16 (the level of VIX when there was political risks such as Charlotteville event), that means investors see that the annualized lost/gain within the next 30 days is about 16% max. Yes, the VIX is used as a proxy of \"fear gauge\" (since it is calculated from the out of money puts/calls of SPX, and because downward volatility is always greater than upward volatility). Yes, it is non-linear (because options are non-linear). Yes, the forecast by the market of \"annualized gain/loss of 16% for the next 30 days\" is just an average, there could be larger movements. But this is in the heart of good judgement system: I am using the wisdom of the crowd (especially those professional money managers, since they are the one using SPX options to hedge their porfolios, with their money or reputation on the line). So, I would be ready to revise my forecast when VIX cross over 20. At that level, the market signals an elevated anxiety. Coming from another angle: the historical data of VIX, especially the proability of VIX to be 30 within 5 days of a given level of VIX. From that data, I could see that the probability of VIX = 30 given current VIX of 16 is pretty much 0. And these are through much more uncertain political climate. The probability becomes non-null when VIX=20. Therefore, I'll re-evaluate my prediction when VIX cross over 20.

Put it this way, active investors usually find some money from the back of the sofa following a market sell off, passive investors by definition do not.  Momentum investors such as CTAs, will sell, and push volatility higher in adverse conditions. Risk targeting investors likewise.  In my mind the industry that has sprouted around volatility is similar to structured credit in the mid 2000's, which took a couple of years for inventory to clear.  I suspect volatility might be faster to unwind, but most importantly, any event that pushes it to 20, is likely to see technical pressure blow it to 40.
