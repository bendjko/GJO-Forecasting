The government maintains that it can make the notification by use of the so-called \u201croyal prerogative\u201d....The Supreme Court appeal, however, will not be a mere re-run of the High Court case. There are two new issues which make the hearing more complex. The first is that the Supreme Court will also be hearing two references from courts in Northern Ireland, which are also dealing with cases about the Article 50 notification. The second is that the devolved governments of Scotland and Wales will intervene, with formal submissions about how the notification (and royal prerogative) should operate in the context of devolution.\" Since it is really impossible to predict which way it will go with no understanding of the underlying legal issues, will take the common sense approach that this is too big a decision to be left to the PM alone, especially in a country with a long tradition in a parliamentary democracy, and in this case there is more that one parliament involved.  The long term consensus was 75%,  however as we are sailing uncharted legal waters, this might be too overconfident and will go for 60%.

The translations in what languages will be officially recogniced as binding. At least English and French but probably at least one other language. The British will call in the English version, but the French could go for the equally binding french translation (that might be interpreted differently) etcetera.
