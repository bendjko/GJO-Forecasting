It is _really_ hard to read this.  If the question was \"Will pro-union parties hold a majority?\", then I would be 75% confident of saying \"No\" ... but a 67-67 tie a real possibility here. Final few polls (after the official ban on polling) are just reiterations of previous polls, and may well include the same response collated multiple times.  (In other words, does someone indicating an intention to vote Cs to a Feedback pollster on 15 Dec have their preference counted towards the results for all of the 8-15 Dec, 9-16 Dec, 10-17 Dec, and 11-18 Dec polls?  In that case, the \"weight\" of the recurrent polls is severely overestimated. Regardless, looking at the repeated polling over the longer term (2-3mth), there is clear evidence of a _lack_ of movement in predicted seats between pro-union and pro-independence (only shuffling back and forward between parties on the same side of the fence).  There appears to be no last minute swing one way or another. So taking polling at face value, it is a coin-toss, and I should forecast \"Yes\" at 50%. But should I take polling at face value?  Lets review the polling accuracy from the last election in 2015 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_regional_election,_2015) for the pollsters still around now. Some pollsters (Feedback, Invymark) pretty much nailed the pro-independence seat count at 72 (tending to overestimate JxSi, and underestimate the CUP).  Feedback has consistently predicted pro-independence at 69 seats this time.  Invymark, 66-67 seats. Frustratingly, the pollsters who seemed to slightly over-weight the pro-independence parties in 2015 (GAD3, Metroscopia, Sigma Dos) ... are the ones who are most cautious about a pro-independence win now.  Are they over-correcting? NC Report and Infortecnica have been the outliers - by a large amount - on the low end of pro-independence predictions on both occasions.  I think we can discount them. The only pollster who seemed to _slightly_ underestimate the eventual pro-independence in 2015 was GESOP, who has run many more polls this time around, and has consistently predicted a small (68-69 seat) pro-independence win in 2017. So compiling all of that ... it doesn't really help, does it?  I guess the only thing to go on - do I trust the pollsters who do larger polls - who have a very slight preference for pro-independence to fall short of 68 seats, or the serial pollsters, who slightly favour them just getting over the line? Really, I've got no idea.  And there's even a chance that GJO might adjudicate this question with an unexpected definition of \"pro-independence parties\" (shades of the Argentinian Senate election question) - in that case, I see NO chance of CUP/JxCat/ERC leaving the \"pro-independence\" count, but there is a tiny chance that CeC-P might leave their \"neutral\" position and become overtly \"pro-independence\" (especially if there is a hung parliament)."], [41523, "2017-12-20T04:57:11Z", [0.05], ""], [21884, "2017-12-20T01:41:50Z", [0.1], "it seems the leadership of these parties has scared and therefore results of polls are decreasing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_regional_election,_2017"], [34501, "2017-12-19T23:22:44Z", [0.57], ""], [40960, "2017-12-19T20:23:27Z", [0.55], ""], [37379, "2017-12-19T20:20:59Z", [0.47], ""], [42552, "2017-12-19T15:38:47Z", [0.35], ""], [691, "2017-12-19T15:08:30Z", [0.32], ""], [28414, "2017-12-19T13:12:34Z", [0.4], ""], [28414, "2017-12-19T13:11:58Z", [0.42], ""], [42162, "2017-12-19T13:09:57Z", [0.42], ""], [14493, "2017-12-19T12:47:13Z", [0.47], "Averaging the polls you get an almost exactly 50/50 chance, but the GJO consensus is 40% yes.

Similarly, the JxSi coalition (now fighting separately as ERC and JxCat) seems to be set to lose 0-2 seats. Interestingly, polls with different estimates of turnout do not seem to give different outcomes: I would have thought that higher turnouts would have favoured the pro-unionist factions.  Certainly that seems to be how pundits are calling it.  Perhaps the pro-unionist voters who previously might have stayed at home are being balanced out by moderates who are upset by the Spanish response to the referendum.
