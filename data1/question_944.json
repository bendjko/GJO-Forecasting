Anyway, here is what I've gathered so far: How could this be a yes?\n1) any country on the potential candidate list becomes an official candidate (Bosnia and Herzegovina or Kosovo) [1]\n2) any country on the official candidate list starts negotiations (Albania or Macedonia). Correct me if I am wrong but Turkey, Serbia and Montenegro seem irrelevant [1]\n3) any country not currently an official candidate or a potential candidate becomes an official candidate. (I am not aware of any countries with potential here) When could it happen? The only Council meeting before 1 July is the one at the end of June [2].  Considerations: The Commission has recommended that Albania and Macedonia begin accession talks [3]. From my understanding, this means that it will be on the agenda for the meeting. The current agenda document does suggest something to that effect. So the question is: is there unanimous support in the Council? For Macedonia, the Commission has recommended accession talks for a long time but has been consistently blocked by Greece. For Albania, this is a first.  Macron wants to see reforms before enlargement [3]. There is skepticism in the Netherlands too. [4] I am seeing conflicting signals from Germany in the English press. In general, for Northern European countries enlargement helps feed opposition parties on the far right, which is a concern. On the other hand, enlargement of the EU is becoming an important mechanism to diminish Russia's sphere of influence in these countries. Still, the memories of EU's double dip recession and North-to-South bailouts also linger in many countries, and might be an important factor. This report (EDIT: realized I didn't link it before - see [5]) argues that it is improbable for any of the listed candidates to be ready to join the EU anytime soon, suggesting they have a long way to go. To even begin talks, countries have to demonstrate they have made sufficient progress. Albania continues to have issues with judicial independence and free media. [6] For Macedonia, it seems like they have a ways to go in resolving a dispute with Greece. [7] and quoted below: \"The prospects for a Greek-Macedonian deal are nonetheless uncertain. Athens is pressing for changes to Macedonia\u2019s constitution that would eliminate such a threat. Mr Zaev is open to the idea, but any changes will need ratification twice from Macedonia\u2019s parliament. Besides, he wants to bolster the legitimacy of a settlement with Greece by submitting any constitutional changes to a referendum. Clearing all three hurdles will not be easy. Nor should Greek approval be taken for granted. Alexis Tsipras, the leftwing prime minister, spots a chance for glory. Yet his nationalist coalition partners, Greece\u2019s conservative opposition and the Orthodox church are vocal critics of his diplomacy.  Lastly, not all EU governments are keen to open accession talks with Macedonia. At Nato some do not see Macedonia\u2019s entry as a priority. We shall learn more from an EU summit in June and a Nato summit in July. Both events may arrive too soon for a Greek-Macedonian deal. If so, the EU and Nato should resist the temptation to use the setback as an excuse for neglecting the Macedonian question. The Balkans today is too fragile to permit such complacency.\" [1] https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/countries/check-current-status_en\n[2] http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/calendar/?filters=2031\n[3] https://www.rferl.org/a/european-commission-recommends-membership-talks-with-macedonia-albania/29173244.html\n[4] https://exit.al/en/2018/05/07/dutch-mps-albania-is-not-ready-for-opening-negotiations/\n[5] https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13501763.2017.1348385?src=recsys\n[6] https://www.transparency.org/country/ALB\n[7] https://www.ft.com/content/aa60b6cc-4ebb-11e8-9471-a083af05aea7"], [58259, "2018-05-11T20:56:20Z", [0.0], ""], [40930, "2018-05-11T20:51:01Z", [0.0], ""], [11885, "2018-05-11T18:36:33Z", [0.0], ""], [4042, "2018-05-11T18:17:14Z", [0.0], ""], [5018, "2018-05-11T14:16:03Z", [0.01], ""], [15196, "2018-05-11T04:16:11Z", [0.0], ""], [172, "2018-05-11T02:21:02Z", [0.01], ""], [8670, "2018-05-11T01:57:08Z", [0.02], ""], [57593, "2018-05-10T20:15:54Z", [0.13], ""], [31450, "2018-05-10T18:55:07Z", [0.0], "Definitely not in the time frame.
