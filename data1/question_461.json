However, the IMF participated in the drafting of the MoU with a view of providing financial assistance in the future upon satisfaction of two conditions: (1) a detailed fiscal package that provides a sustainable economic trajectory (focus on pension reform), and (2) the provision of \u201csignificant debt relief, well beyond what has been considered so far,\u201d since \u201cGreece\u2019s debt has become unsustainable and that Greece cannot restore debt sustainability solely through actions on its own.\u201d It is clear that none of the two aforementioned conditions have been fully met. On the structural adjustment side, the Greek government is unwilling to implement even more austerity measures, especially in relation to a further reduction of pensions, after almost 6 years of consolidation. On the debt relief side, the Eurozone Member States, and particularly some such as Germany, essentially oppose any debt relief (which has been reiterated as a necessary action by the IMF), least of all any that would go further than what has already been considered (i.e. a mediocre extension of Greek debt maturities). In the meantime, the IMF considers the targets set by the Greek program as unachievable for the medium to long terms to achieve a sustainable fiscal position. So is it necessary for the IMF to partake in the Greek program? For the IMF itself, certainly not. The legal provisions do not contain any type of reciprocity clause, and do not commit the IMF to accepting the request of the Eurozone Member State concerned; in this case Greece. However, on the EU\u2019s side, it seems necessary for a Eurozone Member State that receives financial assistance through the ESM \u2013 such as Greece \u2013 to request similar assistance from the IMF. In either case, Greece already committed at the highest level (Eurosummit) to requesting IMF assistance and is, therefore, restrained in perceiving a request for IMF participation as optional, especially considering the importance that some Eurozone Member States, such as Germany, place on the IMF\u2019s participation as a guarantor for the program\u2019s efficiency and success.  However, in the case that the IMF denies the provision of assistance, then there is no stipulation as to how the process unfolds, although it would seem logical that the ESM-based program would continue. What happens remains to be seen. However, clear legal limitations exist as to the options of the Greek government to reject or not apply for IMF participation.\nhttp://euandgreece.blogactiv.eu/2017/02/02/is-the-imf-necessary-for-the-3rd-greek-program/\n____________________________________\nCOMMENT:  Like many Qs in GJO time is of the essence; this Q closes on sept. 1 and the IMF executive Board has recess for the month of Aug (my guess is 7 to 25th) leaving little time to put extra items on the agenda.

Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos said Monday the ECB should include Greek debt in its program of bond purchases, known as quantitative easing or QE, to help the country return to bond markets and end its reliance on bailout loans from European governments. A decision by the ECB to buy Greek debt would greatly boost investors\u2019 confidence in Greece and could be a turning point in the country\u2019s eight-year debt crisis, Athens believes. But the ECB previously has said it won\u2019t add Greece to its QE program until the International Monetary Fund says Greece\u2019s debt is sustainable. The IMF, however, is refusing to say that until Germany and other eurozone governments agree to restructure their loans to Greece. The Athens government fears that the IMF and Germany may agree to postpone further discussions about Greek debt and that the ECB will withhold the hoped-for support for Greece via QE as a result. \u201cEuropean institutions should have their own strategies and own opinions. They should not hide behind the analysis of other institutions,\u201d Mr. Tsakalotos told reporters in Athens on Monday. Mr. Tsakalotos and other Greek officials are hoping the ECB will find a way to give them QE even if there isn\u2019t yet a full agreement on debt relief between the IMF and European governments. Otherwise, they fear Greece\u2019s chances of economic recovery and a return to bond markets will be delayed and possibly jeopardized. If Athens hasn\u2019t regained stable access to bond markets by next year, it will need another bailout to stay in the euro\u2014the country\u2019s fourth such bailout since it lost investors\u2019 confidence in 2010.   \u201cThere is very little point in entering a [bailout] program if the goal is not to leave the program,\u201d the Greek finance minister said. \u201cAnd leaving the program should be the responsibility not just of the debtor country but the creditor country as well.\u201d ECB President Mario Draghi sent ambiguous signals while speaking at the European Parliament on Monday. \u201cQE for Greece is not to be taken for granted,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ECB will have to have its own independent assessment\u2026I want to make clear that [analysis of Greece\u2019s debt sustainability] by the IMF\u2026doesn\u2019t imply\u201d anything for the ECB\u2019s own assessment, he said. While that comment left open the possibility that the ECB might act even before the IMF is satisfied that Greece is solvent, Mr. Draghi also doused Greek hopes by saying he wanted a \u201cfull agreement\u201d between Greece and its creditors, including the specification of measures to reduce Greece\u2019s debt burden, before considering QE (para. 1-10).

Greece needs new cash from the euro zone to avoid a default in July when it has to repay some 7.3 billion euros ($8.20 billion) worth of maturing loans. To get the money, the Greek parliament approved pension cuts and tax hikes last Thursday. But for the disbursement to take place, Greece needs to implement some 140 \"prior actions\" - laws that have to be passed to make the reforms stick - and even though most of them had been done, some still remained to be completed. The chairman of euro zone finance ministers Jeroen Dijsselbloem told a news conference that work was progressing for the disbursement to take place \"before the summer\". The other reason why no new loans could be agreed was the lack of agreement between the euro zone and the IMF on debt relief for Greece. Several euro zone governments, notably Germany, do not want to pay out any new loans until the IMF joins the bailout, and the IMF says it can only do so if it gets more clarity from the euro zone on what kind of debt relief it will offer Greece at the end of the bailout in 2018 to make its debt sustainable. \"The Euro-group held an in-depth discussion on the sustainability of Greece's public debt but did not reach an overall agreement,\" the euro zone ministers said in a statement. \"Work will continue in the coming weeks within the framework agreed in May 2016 with a view to reaching a definitive conclusion at the next Euro-group meeting. This includes an ambitious and economically sound medium-term primary surplus path for Greece,\" the statement said. The ministers and the IMF agreed Greece would keep a primary surplus - the budget balance before debt servicing - at 3.5 percent of GDP for five years after the end of the bailout in 2018, before the surplus can fall. Agreement on debt was not possible because the IMF wants the euro zone to give more detail to a declaration from May 2016 in which the ministers describe some of the actions they could take, if necessary, to keep down Greek gross financing needs (para. 1-10).

Without the deal, no new loans can be disbursed to Athens, even though the bailout is now handled only by euro zone governments, and Greece needs new credit to repay some 7.3 billion euros worth of maturing loans in July. Without the loans, Athens is likely to default - a bad start for a country that wants to return to market financing next year when its latest bailout, the third since 2010, ends in mid-2018. For its part, Greece has done what it could to secure a deal. It has agreed, albeit after months of negotiations, with the euro zone lenders and the IMF on pensions and tax reforms. Euro zone officials say a report prepared by experts on whether Greece has implemented what is called \"prior actions\" - laws that have to be passed to make the reforms stick - is positive. That means only a deal on debt relief between the IMF and the euro zone now stands between Athens and new loans. But an agreement is far from simple. \"The chances of a deal are 50-50. We have done pretty good preparations, I can express a hope there will be an agreement, but it is an assumption, not a forecast,\" a senior EU official involved with the preparations said.

The same countries, however, oppose a firm commitment of debt relief for Greece, fearing the disapproval of bailout-weary voters at home. They are also concerned that once Athens gets a debt deal, it would lose the incentive to continue reforms. The discussion therefore focuses on how to make a euro zone statement on Greek debt relief from a year ago, more detailed and more concrete. \"The IMF wants maximum (debt relief) commitment upfront, while others would prefer to be more precise only in 2018,\" a senior euro zone official said, referring to the end of the third bailout in mid-2018, by which time lenders would have a full view of Greek reform completion and the latest economic data.

The leftist-led government hopes that legislating the measures, four days before euro zone finance ministers meet in Brussels, will convince its lenders to release a 7.5-billion-euro bailout tranche and grant it further debt relief. It is now up to the lenders to make good their promises, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras told journalists. \"We deserve and we expect from Monday's Euro-group a decision regulating debt relief which will correspond to the sacrifices of the Greek people,\" he said, referring to a meeting of euro zone finance ministers on Monday. Lenders have agreed in principle to debt restructuring but not on details. Shortly before the measures were approved just before midnight, some protesters hurled petrol bombs and firecrackers at police guarding the legislature. They responded with tear gas. Greece has seen its national output shrink by a quarter since it was first forced to seek external financial aid in return for spending cutbacks in 2010. The government, sagging in opinion polls, hopes a conclusion by lenders of its reforms progress, coupled with a restructure to bring down a mountain of overhanging debt, will allow Greece to be included in the European Central Bank's asset-buying program and return to bond markets in the coming months. Athens needs aid to repay debt maturing in July. It agreed to adopt more austerity, which will be implemented in 2019 and 2020, to convince the International Monetary Fund to participate financially in its latest 86-billion-euro bailout. To sweeten the pill, Tsipras has promised to offset the new measures with tax relief also legislated on Thursday. It will be implemented only if Greece meets its fiscal targets.

The Greek economy is projected to grow 1.8 per cent this year, against an earlier forecast of 2.7 per cent according to the proposal, which was presented to parliament late on Saturday alongside an omnibus bill containing scores of structural reforms. Lawmakers are set to approve both bills by May 18, ahead of a meeting of the euro area finance ministers on May 22 where the issue of debt relief for Greece is due to be discussed. The Syriza government\u2019s revised growth projection for 2017 is more pessimistic than the European Commission\u2019s forecast of 2.1 per cent, down from 2.7 per cent at the start of this year. Growth in 2018 and 2019 would also be lower at 2.4 per cent and 2.6 per cent, respectively, compared with earlier forecasts of above 3 per cent of gross domestic product, according to the budget projection. The lower growth forecasts reflected a six-month delay in wrapping up the latest bailout review by monitors from the EU and International Monetary Fund. A deal with creditors was reached early this month but fine-tuning of details of the reforms continued until hours before the bill went to parliament. Analysts said the delay resulted from government foot-dragging over broadening the tax base and making additional reductions in pensions to ensure that Greece could achieve an annual primary budget surplus, before making repayments of debt, of 3.5 per cent of GDP between 2018 and 2021. Prolonged uncertainty over the review prompted a decline in consumption by Greek households, a freeze on investment and renewed outflows of bank deposits in the last quarter of 2016 and the first quarter this year. Greece\u2019s creditors on Friday discussed prospects for debt relief on the margins of a meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors from the G7 group of wealthy nations.

This is wrong. The statement that the ESM issued jointly with the EU Commission, the ECB and the IMF on 2 May instead says: \u201cThis preliminary agreement will now be complemented by further discussions in the coming weeks on a credible strategy to ensure that Greece's debt is sustainable.\u201d Whether this will lead to debt relief in the end and if so to what extent is not clear today. The 25 May 2016 statement of the euro area finance ministers continues to be the reference. According to this statement, possible medium- to long-term debt relief measures for Greece can only be decided once Greece has successfully completed its ESM programme in 2018 and the reform conditions linked to the programme, and if such debt relief measures prove to be necessary. It is important to recall the principle that nominal debt relief (\u201chaircut\u201d) is not possible.\nhttps://www.esm.europa.eu/interviews/letter-editor-frankfurter-allgemeine-zeitung Statement by the EC, ESM, ECB and IMF on negotiations with Greece\nMay 2, 2017\nStaff teams from the European Commission, European Stability Mechanism, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund have reached a preliminary agreement with the Greek authorities on a policy package to support the recovery in Greece.

The tone is much difference from the hot summer of 2015, although always cautious there is a certain positiveness.\nThe IMF concluded the annual Art. IV with Greece where they review the financial situation of the country and after discussions at the Board the decide to give them another tranche. Here is the wording from the report:\n\"....Since then [2015], the situation has stabilized, and growth is estimated to have resumed modestly in 2016. Notwithstanding the substantial progress achieved by Greece, it still faces fundamental challenges: (i) a vulnerable structure of the public finances; (ii) significant tax evasion and an ineffective tax administration; (iii) impaired bank and private sector balance sheets; and (iv) pervasive structural obstacles to investment and growth.  Please note the demands in (i); these are conditions that Greece need to address to obtain the release of the tranche. I'm saying ADRESSING not Meet, because I think that it is not realistic to expect that Greece solves their tax evasion problems just like that. It takes years! Inefficiencies in both public finances and tax administration instead should show some progress as well as eliminating obstacles to growth.  @lsgold7 @Wildwood2000 @Anneinak  All things considered I keep my forecast as is."], [368, "2017-05-12T18:06:04Z", [1.0], ""], [35401, "2017-05-12T16:23:59Z", [1.0], "The EU wants to keep its members following Brexit, by failing to fund Greece the EU would further lose credibility and support.

Talks over reforms in the energy and labor market and pension cuts and income tax increases have dragged on for months, mainly due to differences between EU lenders and the International Monetary Fund over fiscal targets. Athens and the lenders reached a preliminary deal this month in Malta on key elements of reforms to produce savings worth 2 percent of gross domestic product. Tsipras, who faces national elections in 2019 and whose popularity is sagging, said the country would legislate the additional measures sought by its lenders but implementing them was contingent on securing further debt relief. \"We will obviously legislate (the measures) in order to secure a deal on debt relief,\" Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras told ANT1 television. \"They won't be implemented ... unless we get a solution on debt.\" He added that a sovereign government had the right to back out of a deal if its interlocutors did not respect it.

The primary surplus -- the leftover before debt repayments that is the focus of International Monetary Fund-European Union creditors -- was more than eight times what they had targeted. Data released by Greek statistics service ELSTAT -- to be confirmed on Monday by the EU -- showed the primary budget surplus at 3.9 percent of gross domestic product last year versus a down wordy revised 2.3 percent deficit in 2015. This was calculated under European System of Accounts guidelines, which differ from the methodology used by Greece's in bailout deliberations. Under EU-IMF standards, the surplus was even larger. Government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos said the primary budget surplus under bailout terms reached 4.19 percent of gross domestic product last year versus the 0.5 percent of GDP target. \"It is more than eight times above target,\" Tzanakopoulos said in a statement. \"Therefore, the targets set under the bailout program for 2017 and 2018 will certainly be attained.\" Debt-strapped Greece and its creditors have been at odds for months over the country's fiscal performance, delaying the conclusion of a key bailout review which could unlock needed bailout funds. The IMF, which has reservations on whether Greece can meet high primary surplus targets, has yet to decide if it will fund Greece's current bailout, which expires in 2018 (para. 1-9).

The loan packages from the ESM and EFSF are by far the largest the world has ever seen. The two institutions own half of Greece\u2019s debt. The vast and deeply rooted problems in Greece mean the programmes have lasted much longer than those of other crisis-hit countries. The loans, at very low interest rates with long maturities, are giving Greece fiscal breathing space to bring its public finances in order. And because of the ESM\u2019s cash-for-reform approach, Greece is making impressive progress in modernising its economy. Greece has received two thirds of the total funds disbursed by the ESM and the EFSF. The money is lent under strict conditions. Athens must implement a host of tough reform measures. It must fix its banking system, ensure sound public finances, and liberalise markets. Creditors are closely monitoring progress in achieving these measures. They only disburse money when Greece takes the steps it has promised. In the middle of 2015, Athens entered a new ESM programme of up to \u20ac86 billion. It was the third programme for the country. The decision sparked fierce public debate across Europe. In part this was due to the acrimonious negotiations preceding the decision.\n_______________________________\nCOMMENT:  A lot of explanations and a good dose of goodwill can be found here https://www.esm.europa.eu/assistance/greece\n"], [23006, "2017-04-10T16:17:55Z", [0.99], "The only this way won't happen is if the EU doesn't have the funds to loan"], [32720, "2017-04-10T14:37:49Z", [0.9], ""], [30389, "2017-04-10T07:40:33Z", [0.8], ""], [7124, "2017-04-10T05:21:27Z", [0.88], "As usual they will pass the buck down to the future"], [32957, "2017-04-10T01:28:43Z", [0.99], ""], [23284, "2017-04-09T18:29:51Z", [0.89], ""], [27461, "2017-04-09T18:17:44Z", [1.0], ""], [23006, "2017-04-09T16:18:47Z", [0.95], ""], [9088, "2017-04-09T16:12:43Z", [0.65], ""], [18679, "2017-04-09T16:03:59Z", [0.99], ""], [30200, "2017-04-09T15:43:45Z", [0.99], "Seems decided.
