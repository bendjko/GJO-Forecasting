If the trend changes a few months from now, I will revise my probabilities accordingly.\nhttp://maps.clb.org.hk/strikes/en  This is an interest question.  I would have never guessed such data exists.  This is probably a managed number, its China after all.  But even with such figures it is possible to discern some interesting trends.

EDIT (giving away \"secrets\" haha): From 2013 - 2015, the reported number has approximately doubled each year (total). The May - Oct period is approx 1.8x of prior year. So, into the mathematics black box and it looks to me approximately 2,115 for May - Oct. I assume there is some pressure to not overreport (counting every minor event), but still trying to track some level of reality.  There are increasing pressures within China that can't be ignored, e.g., a slowing commodities-based economy, a slowing manufacturing base, a dismal effort at controlling the stock market (Poof goes approx $2.7T at one point, across individual investors, companies, and Chinese gov't, though this has mediated since then.),\nmore people looking for higher wages and for work (how Western is that!?!?), and my personal favorite in Yahoo Odd News....dueling bulldozers because of pissed off construction workers. (Damn...they better include that event in the statistics just because of the \"cool\" factor.)  Encouraging stock market \"betting\" (betting: a long Asian tradition...I'm serious) rather than \"investment\" doesn't really help the little guy get ahead and decide he/she has the extra cushion to go out and take that vacation or buy the upgraded appliance or splurge on better meals, or refurbish the apartment, etc.  The Chinese gov't needs to go back to the roots put forth by Deng Xiaoping. Not just billionaires and millionaires, but the little guy needs to make increasing income to take home to family, feel happy, gripe about life, work, and gov't, but them go back to the job with belief there will be increasing opportunities ahead.  But the government seems increasingly uptight (sign of weakness, really) about so many things and applying a heavy political filter to so many things that everybody is running scared. They appear unable to provide an economic platform that allows risk (thus failure) and also seems little concerned by the little businesses that could spring forth and boost the economy, so they continue to focus on the established BIG companies and rigid plans. In my opinion, they should be opening the door to franchises......tested models for how to set up a business, run it to proper standards, provide a value product, , hire employees, and everybody is happier.  So, to add some balance.....the crack down on corruption is necessary.  Administrators and managers need to adjust to a new reality, decent but honorable pay, but no stealing. They are in their positions to serve their local citizenry and, thereby, the national interests. so, local small business owners need to hold to the same standard and not cut costs by slipping in lead or fake fillers because its cheaper. Where's the Chinese version of Angie's List when you need it? Here are some comparative numbers for the US:\nAs of the 2010 Census, there were 27.9 million small businesses registered in the United States, compared to just 18,500 companies of 500 employees or more. Included in that total figure are sole proprietorships (73.2 percent), corporations (19.5 percent), and franchises (2 percent). 52 percent of small businesses are home-based. The most important thing to note? 99.7 percent of U.S. employer firms are small businesses. Small businesses produced 46 percent of the private nonfarm GDP in 2008 (the most recent year for which the source data are available), compared with 48 percent in 2002.\u201d Table 3: Employer Firm Births and Deaths*\n             1999-2000;          2004-2005;      2007-2008;      2008-2009;\nBirths:    574,300 ;           644,122;           597,074;            518,500;\nDeaths:  542,831;            565,745;           641,400;            680,716;\n*Figures are March to March"], [10759, "2016-04-20T16:22:00Z", [0.38, 0.04, 0.02, 0.4, 0.16], ""], [4634, "2016-04-20T16:21:35Z", [0.38, 0.04, 0.02, 0.4, 0.16], ""], [10039, "2016-04-20T15:20:33Z", [0.35, 0.06, 0.01, 0.45, 0.13], ""], [22300, "2016-04-20T15:05:17Z", [0.1, 0.05, 0.05, 0.75, 0.05], ""], [12874, "2016-04-20T12:14:05Z", [0.43, 0.01, 0.01, 0.46, 0.09], ""], [961, "2016-04-20T11:53:21Z", [0.3, 0.05, 0.0, 0.55, 0.1], ""], [94, "2016-04-20T02:37:14Z", [0.25, 0.11, 0.02, 0.45, 0.17], "The overall pattern of protests is a somewhat gradual increase until October of last year, followed by a sudden spike until January, followed by a decline to the present.
