It's sitting at 1.8%. Looking at the individual breakdowns... IDK. If I'm honest there is no real strong correlations that I can see.  1. Even if Jan has a big jump in monthly CPI, the 12month is more muted. Therefore the possibilities are really between 1.6-1.8 and 1.8-2. If we're getting technical, 1.6-1.8 category is slightly larger (includes 1.6 and 1.8) where the other doesn't include the bookends.... so pure probability, given all chance, is stronger on that side slightly. 2. FREDs longterm CPI seems pretty linear: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PCEPILFE which lends to the change staying about 1.8 +/- 0.1. 3. A look at Dec to Jan 12 month changes in CPI from 2008 to today shows:\n-3 decreases\n-2 no change\n-4 increases\nif anything that bodes for a likelyhood of a change happening, not really any direction. I looked at this mostly to gauge if time of year had any affect on CPI. 4. CIP all items seems to be a more volatile version (makes sense since it adds in energy and food) and at times seems to be both leading and lagging or somewhere inbetween (or not even correlated). I'll toss that up to WTF. 5. Doing the pure math, January 2018 monthly raw CPI would need to be 0.43% to push the Jan 12 month over the 1.8 threshold. Although GJO seems to be using only out to 1 decimal which means if Labor would need to report 1.9, the actual amount would need to be 1.85% for the Jan 12 month, which means raw Jan 2018 cpi needs to be 0.47%.  This means December to January increase of the raw CPI change needs to be 0.44%. The average of the 9 years of the D-J raw CPI change is 0.35%. Last time over 0.44% was in the recession (0.56% in 2009). Last 3 years avg was 0.41% increase D-J raw. ***I pulled the data for #5's analysis-https://data.bls.gov/  using this table: Series Title:  All items less food and energy in U.S. city average, all urban consumers, not seasonally adjusted I'm going to say that the likelyhood is much greater it stays within 1.6-1.8 for these reasons. I don't think consumer sentiment or the supply side pricing to meet it is getting that much better. If anything maybe a plateau. I think GJO will use the 1 decimal news release to measure which further drives to the 1.8% inclusive. The argument for overweight >1.8 is that the tax change will drive up consumer buying but that might not drive up prices in the short term. It possibly drives down prices if suppliers are looking to move merchandise and take advantage of extra cash in the hands of consumers. I'm going to break from the average and strongly overweight the lower bracket."], [28414, "2018-01-12T14:42:39Z", [0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [28414, "2018-01-12T14:39:25Z", [0.0, 0.55, 0.45, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [38564, "2018-01-12T05:50:37Z", [0.01, 0.45, 0.45, 0.08, 0.01], "Just checked the last 12 months, WAY more certain now."], [38564, "2018-01-12T05:48:17Z", [0.1, 0.4, 0.4, 0.08, 0.02], "Not my best spread, but yeah.
