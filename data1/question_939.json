So while an actual timeline is up in the air, it seems likely that whomever wins the presidential election will seek to hold ascension talks with NATO as well as MAP, due to Poroshenko meeting with NATO this past December, in which NATO reaffirmed support for Ukraine against Russian aggression. \nNATO announced at a meeting in December 2018 that it is prepared to accept the submission of an ANP by Bosnia and Herzegovina. While some members of the presidency welcomed this new development and expressed hope that state institutions would begin developing an ANP, the leader of the Serb nationaalists in the presidency has repeatedly been against NATO membership. It\u2019s clear that any closer movement by Bosnia and Herzegovina will be contingent on dealing with conflict amongst its different ethnic groups.\nDue to the ongoing situation in Ukraine, I find it doubtful that Georgia will make any serious moves to join NATO before April 1st. Allowing Georgia to go further along in the membership process would place pressure on Russia that could impede negotiations over the Ukrainian conflict and impede NATO operations in other areas, so both Georgia and NATO are better served maintaining their current cooperative relationship. \nThe Republic of North Macedonia formally signed a letter for ascension in February, and will likely be a full member by the end of the year.\nhttps://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/03/zelensky-face-poroshenko-ukraine-run-exit-poll-190331171422240.html\nhttps://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_49212.htm\nhttps://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-polytics/2671315-poroshenko-we-will-either-reaffirm-course-for-eu-nato-or-return-to-2013.html\nhttps://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_49127.htm\nhttps://www.rferl.org/a/nato-gives-bosnia-green-light-to-move-toward-membership/29639709.html\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/world/europe/north-macedonia-nato-russia.html\n"], [1333, "2019-03-31T18:17:24Z", [0.15, 0.85, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [20660, "2019-03-31T17:28:40Z", [0.0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.2, 0.0], ""], [67633, "2019-03-31T16:54:31Z", [0.1, 0.55, 0.33, 0.01, 0.01], "I"], [34369, "2019-03-31T09:28:13Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [37793, "2019-03-31T05:28:37Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [525, "2019-03-30T22:56:17Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [67558, "2019-03-30T20:58:54Z", [0.02, 0.92, 0.02, 0.02, 0.02], ""], [10110, "2019-03-30T19:36:00Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [15409, "2019-03-30T17:10:42Z", [0.05, 0.88, 0.05, 0.01, 0.01], ""], [20156, "2019-03-30T16:18:37Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2019-03-30T13:31:23Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [67553, "2019-03-30T11:39:18Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [62808, "2019-03-30T08:24:02Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [67879, "2019-03-29T21:59:34Z", [0.8, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05], ""], [65401, "2019-03-29T17:55:55Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [67611, "2019-03-29T17:17:21Z", [0.03, 0.92, 0.03, 0.01, 0.01], ""], [67552, "2019-03-29T15:53:51Z", [0.03, 0.88, 0.03, 0.03, 0.03], ""], [67601, "2019-03-29T14:47:31Z", [0.01, 0.96, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01], ""], [67631, "2019-03-28T19:31:53Z", [0.01, 0.96, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01], "Republic of North Macedonia"], [67387, "2019-03-28T16:38:02Z", [0.0, 0.99, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2019-03-28T10:47:18Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2019-03-27T19:14:57Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [67129, "2019-03-27T15:35:05Z", [0.0, 0.99, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [68146, "2019-03-26T17:56:57Z", [0.25, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "Ratification ongoing."], [62808, "2019-03-26T08:55:03Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [68126, "2019-03-26T01:13:39Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [68126, "2019-03-26T01:12:57Z", [0.1, 0.9, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [68126, "2019-03-26T01:12:01Z", [0.9, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [68126, "2019-03-25T22:51:53Z", [0.1, 0.9, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [62808, "2019-03-25T22:18:40Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [67575, "2019-03-25T17:18:10Z", [0.0, 0.96, 0.02, 0.01, 0.01], ""], [23879, "2019-03-25T16:40:05Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "Updating from 0/98/2/0/0.

Currently, North Macedonia has the highest chance of ascending seeing as their October 2018 proposal was accepted in 2019. It is very likely. Bosnia and Herzegovina submitted a proposal on December 5th, 2018 and while an April 1st turn around would not be unheard of, the swiftness may be unlikely considering Serbia's current opposition of the country and their own debates on joining NATO. Therefore, their ascension is unlikely but possible. Georgia is very unlikely since NATO members were reluctant to accept their 2014 Membership Action Plan, and a 5-year delay in acceptance has not been seen in any NATO member post-USSR.  Ukraine was recognized as an aspirant country in March 2018 and they have made joining NATO and the EU a primary foreign policy goal as of September. However, Ukraine has not acted on that mission as of yet and assuming they do tomorrow, it would be a NATO first to respond that quickly before April 1st.

First, the process almost always takes more than 5 years, due to the need for ratification by every existing member and the need for the country wishing to access to NATO to conform its armed forces to a certain degree of interoperability before being allowed to move forward. Secondly, As we can see from the most recent two NATO members, Albania and Croatia, even when all requirements are met formal accession does not usually occur by independent nations, as NATO seems to have a tendency to \"group\" countries together and have multiple formally become members at the same time. Given this, I would rate the likelihood of the only reasonable candidate for NATO accession, N.

Seven weeks to go. My understanding was that (Northern) Macedonia had already done a step last year that qualified it. (Remember, Q started on 18 Apr 2018.) But now it seems to have done another (full acession?), which removes all doubt. So the question becomes, will another country do another step? As I see it there are 3 groups of European/European-adjacent countries: (1) Those currently in the NATO process: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Ukraine.\n(2) Those that already explicitly decided not to join, e.g. by having a policy of neutrality and/or being in the Non-Aligned Movement [1]: Austria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Finland, Ireland, Malta, Sweden, Switzerland.\n(3) Those not in the process, but which haven't opted out either: Armenia, Cyprus, Moldova, Serbia. You could include Kosovo here, but ~4 NATO members don't even recognize Kosovo as a sovereign state so I don't think it will engage with NATO until that's resolved. I was trying to dragonfly-eye this Q by considering other countries (e.g. Mexico, North Africa) but it turns out the rules of NATO specify only European countries may join [2]. Those rules could be changed, but not in 7 weeks. Apparently BH's process is stalled due to \"immovable defense property\" [3]. The page saying this, besides being official NATO material, seems to be kept up-to-date: it contains developments from 6 Feb 2019 (48h ago). So I discard BH. What to expect from Georgia and Ukraine? Inside-view info seems noisy and contradictory, so let's just take an average. NATO has gone from 12 to 30 countries in 70 years. That means 18 countries completed 8 steps each in 70 years, or ~0.114 steps per country per year. That means 2 countries should do ~0.031 steps every 7 weeks. Plugging that into a Poisson calculator [4] we get ~3% chance of another step by Georgia or Ukraine in the timeframe. What to expect from Armenia, Cyprus, Moldova, Serbia? I discard Armenia and Moldova because they have signed up for other kinds of partnership with NATO besides membership, kinds like non-member states have (e.g. the Partnership for Peace, like Ireland); and because they are part of other organizations that include Russia. I further discard Cyprus because it is having trouble even joining the PfP, due to some conflict with Turkey. That leaves Serbia; if 18 countries joined in 70 years, that means ~0.0346 countries start the process every 7 weeks. Using the Poisson calculator again, we get a ~3% chance for Serbia to start the process. Since I rounded both Serbia and Georgia+Ukraine numbers down, let's make it 7% total chance that another country besides Macedonia completes a step.

Prime Minister Zaev declared, \"The people made a great choice and said \u2018yes\u2019 to our future. It is time for lawmakers to follow the voice of the people and to provide support. There will be no better agreement with Greece, nor an alternative for NATO and the EU.\u201d On October 2nd, the Secretary General gave a brief following the referendum in Macedonia.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said this on 2 October: Jens Stoltenberg [NATO Secretary General]: \u201cThe accession talks continue \u2026 the accession talks with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia continues, as long as your country wants to continue those talks and as long as you are implementing the name agreement.  And we stand ready to welcome your country as a new member of the Alliance, with an equal seat around the NATO table, with full membership and also with all the benefits that NATO membership will provide to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.  Because we have seen before that NATO membership is important for security, for stability, but also for prosperity.  The latest example is Montenegro, where investments have doubled since they joined NATO.  It's for Skopje to decide the way forward now.  It was a clear majority in favour of the name agreement, in favour of joining EU and NATO, in the referendum.  But at the same time, the turnout was not as high as many had hoped.  This is a consultative referendum, and the necessary changes in the constitution have to be made by the parliament.  Again, that\u2019s for the parliament and for the people of the country to decide.  What I can say is that the only way to join NATO is by agreeing and implementing the name deal with Greece.  There is no other way.  So, I have seen that someone has indicated the possibility of rejecting the name agreement and, at the same time, join NATO.  That will not happen.  That alternative doesn\u2019t exist.  So, it's for the people of the country and the parliament in Skopje to decide.  But it's my obligation to make it absolutely clear that there is no way to join NATO without fully implementing the name deal.  We are ready to welcome you, but then, of course, you have to implement the deal.\u201d Best regards,\nDylan  Dylan P.

They currently have a slim majority expected to agree to the name change deal agreed upon withe the gov of Greece, but they need 50% of people to actually go out and vote to make.  Probability is probably 85% there, I would guess, especially since ethnic Albanians make up 25% of the Macedonian population and largely support the measure.  For the 30-40% of the rest of Macedonia to turn out for the vote, even if mostly from the younger or middle generations, seems, seems likely.  However, the president has remained firm in opposition and is boycotting the vote out of country (maybe wise), and Russia is still pumping money into campaigning locally against it, as are many Western countries.   If it passes but does't have the voter turnout necessary to ratify, then I think they'll reschedule again shortly after the New Year.  But it sounds like enough people are grudgingly or significantly motivated by economic and security benefits that they'll go with it for now.  Might be a sticky point later.  Still, if it passes, it has to be ratified by the Macedonian parliament (likely if it passes) and then be voted on in Greece as well, and ultimate, I think, Greece would have to agree with the Nato accession step.  At least they've been the roadblock for the last 3 decades.  But I imagine NATO is leaning hard on them, and Greece doesn't really have a lot of public or political power to stand alone against their European allies in this and probably have agreed enough to (grudgingly) move forward if Macedonia ends up agreeing.

But I'll bring my Euro-Atlantic approach on this matter. Just this July 2018 Finland and Sweden signed a defence pact. (https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/finland_and_sweden_sign_defence_pact_in_turku/10295347) The previous few months (let's say 6) there's been a wide discussion on the NATO topic here in Finland. The president of Finland, Sauli Niinist\u00f6, still requires plebiscite on this matter. Even though in my point of view the security matters are probably not the best ones in security topics. My grandparents don't know what the heck NATO is.  Why does it matter to this topic? There has been discussion if Sweden joins NATO that's the time when Finland needs to join as well or the door will be closed for good. So with a small chance on this time frame I'd say that if the other side will join NATO, so will the other. Just some signs that I would like to keep following during this questions:\n- Finland inhabitant's opinions\n- President's opinions\n- Political party's opinions\n- Common EU defence / army (https://medium.com/future-of-europe/jyrki-katainen-discussing-the-future-of-eu-defence-with-citizens-429c68141add)\n- Macedonia (as it has been discussed in this forum) https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_48830.htm#\n- Great Power's, what are they planning to do together\n- Russia's information affection around the Globe\n- Trump's wild cards In conclusion, I belive that my regarding FIN and SWE are not the most probable one, just yet.

Upon depositing their instruments of accession with the US State Department, invitees formally become NATO members\n(https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_49212.htm#) Although NATO held a summit to formally announce the beginning of the accession talks for Macedonia (https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_157315.htm), they clearly stated that the talks would only continue (really, start excepting this announcement) once the name deal and all associated changes had been carried out.  So this seems to be at least in part a public relations announcement rather than the actual start of the 2 major meetings for politics/defense and resources/security/laws.  And I would guess it was made at least in part to strongly encourage Greece and Macedonia to make good on their recent agreement to the name change deal.  And that really is significant given that it is the first reasonably successful agreement to resolve the name dispute since 1991 when Macedonia broke away from Yugoslavia, and which Greece has used to block Macedonia's formal advance in the membership process in 2008.  But I'm not sure whether it counts as formal progress since it is still contingent upon the legal resolution of the name deal in 2 countries where opposition is still significant.\nhttps://www.newsadvance.com/news/world/wire/bigger-is-better-nato-opens-up-to-macedonia-as-rifts/article_7d2b8a60-0d4e-534e-a2a0-dee295dd37ed.html\nhttps://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/progress-on-macedonia-name-change-highlights-balkan-divisions-1.3521780 And there seems to be some disagreement about whether Greece or Macedonia will be able to fulfill all of the legal terms of their recent agreement to go with \"North Macedonia.\"  For one thing, Macedonia still has to formally changes it's country's constitution and hold a referendum on this.  The deal they recently signed with Greece got only 69 of the 120 deputies' votes in their Parliament, and the opposition party nationalists are staging protests and saying they will continue to oppose the process leading up to the referendum in October/November.  The President already refused to sign the deal last month and may try again to refuse to sign, though Macedonian law seems to allow for a law to be ratified despite this veto if it can be ratified twice in Parliament, which is has (and the Speaker of Parliament said he would send it through without signature, so there seems to be some likelihood that the President will again refuse to sign it).  There is wide national support in Macedonia to join Nato, so although people REALLY protested against in earlier this spring, a recent poll suggests that 50% of people are willing to accept the name change in order to join NATO (which doesn't seem like the most promising of starts)\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-greece-macedonia/macedonias-parliament-endorses-name-deal-with-greece-for-second-time-idUSKBN1JV1MP\nhttps://www.rferl.org/a/macedonian-parliament-oks-name-deal-with-greece-for-second-time/29344830.html\nhttp://eu.greekreporter.com/2018/02/03/majority-in-fyrom-support-deal-with-greece-on-name-poll/ And Greece isn't in a significantly better position.  For one thing, Greece's Parliament won't even vote to complete the name change recognition until Macedonia has changed their constitution.  Right now, a vote in Greece doesn't seem to be expected until early 2019.  And Greece's majority party, the radical left Syriza party, has only a slim majority in Parliament right now (even slimmer than the 69 / 120 in Macedonia) with 152 of 300.    \nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-greece-macedonia-namechange/greek-minister-optimistic-over-macedonia-name-deal-despite-hurdles-idUSKBN1JO1HI While this is happening, there are protests on a not insignificant order over the deal that seems to have a slim majority in each of the countries' current governments.  In Greece protests have been going on since early this year, supported and paid for by a variety of organizations including churches, cultural groups, retired officers, etc., and polls suggest that a significant majority (around 70%) of Greeks oppose any agreement to the name.  In addition, Russia, who is very unhappy about another neighbor joining NATO sent it's own money and people in to help stir up local dissent to the deal, resulting in the Greek Parliament expelling some Russian diplomats.  The main opposition parties have vowed to oppose the vote and campaign against it, and even members of Tsirpas party have spoken out against the name deal.  Now Russia is claiming the US is behind Greece's action and vows it will reciprocate (which provides a cover for any who choose to believe it and allows for angry Greeks to stay angry).  The awkwardness for Greek patriots over the \"name giveaway\" that the \"anti-nationalist\" leader Tsirpas and his Syriza party have done is apparently also threatened by rumors and pressure from Albania to change its borders with Greece in its favor.  \nhttp://www.france24.com/en/20180204-thousands-greeks-protest-over-macedonia-name\nhttp://www.france24.com/en/20180618-macedonia-agrees-name-change-deal-with-greece\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/b5728090-86b0-11e8-96dd-fa565ec55929\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-greece-russia-expulsions-diplomat/greece-asked-for-diplomats-expulsion-july-6-greek-diplomatic-source-idUSKBN1K11I1\nhttp://www.ekathimerini.com/230707/article/ekathimerini/news/athens-had-no-choice-but-to-expel-russian-diplomats-sources-say\nhttps://sputniknews.com/world/201807131066323552-ministry-diplomats-greece-us/\nhttps://www.thenationalherald.com/207391/greece-expelling-russian-diplomats-for-funding-fyrom-name-deal-protests/\nhttps://www.thenationalherald.com/207575/new-democracys-lead-over-syriza-shrinks-to-8/\nhttps://www.thenationalherald.com/207369/eu-enlargement-chief-denies-wanting-new-greece-albanian-borders/\nhttps://www.independent.co.uk/voices/alexis-tsipras-eu-brexit-anti-brussels-greece-a8417271.html\nhttps://greekcitytimes.com/2018/07/10/if-you-love-greece-help-us-get-rid-of-tsipras-says-former-syriza-mp/\nhttps://worldview.stratfor.com/article/macedonia-greece-russia-wades-fray-over-balkan-name-dispute\n  So here's the situation as it seems to me now:\n- Macedonia wanted to take the opportunity to move forward but NATO refused to make that happen unless they could get a deal on the name change, so Macedonia pushed it through the acceptance process as quickly as possible with a narrow margin, and enough opposition that it's not yet clear that the general popular vote will follow through in the Fall.\n- NATO saw an opportunity to show that it will hold good on it's promises and welcome new members in if they make good on their promises for reform (unlike the EU, apparently, whose members want more proof of completed reforms here and elsewhere) and to show their support for the deal rather than let the fragile agreement easily fall apart as the countries continued to fight\n- Macedonia has to change its constitution as well as get a general referendum of popular support to show that this will actually happen\n- Assuming this happens (seem more likely than not - 70-90% chance?) then Greece has to agree to it (thankfully only in Parliament and not in a popular vote, where they would surely fail since Greeks have remarkably little practical benefits to lose in this fight and a lot of pride and cultural capital to maintain or even gain by their opposition).  Once Macedonia votes, Greece's Parliament will have to hold a vote to ratify the name deal, which is expected to take place next year.  However, next fall (early to mid-October 2019), and while the current party wishes to encourage the name deal, they have an extremely narrow majority (152 of 300; that said, their majority hasn't been much larger than that since their majority in 2015) and they could lose support from some supporting members of Parliament if national criticism increases or something happens to divide party members or supporters.  The likelihood of Greece's Parliament passing this next year are not clear yet, partly because of the distance in time and partly because public and political discussions may not show all the relevant issues and depth of divisions until they actually have to vote, which they don't yet have to do.  But I would say it's much lower than the likelihood of Macedonian approval - 40-60% chance? so if the question hasn't been resolved by the recent public announcement at the NATO summit that accession talks are starting for Macedonia, then I suspect that we may not have a much clearer idea of whether the accession talks will actually \"start\" until October/November when Macedonia holds its referendum and then Jan-Mar if/when Greece's Parliament votes to accept Macedonia's name change.

If Macedonia were to receive an invitation by NATO at the summit this week that would be an added incentive. When it comes to the timeline after that, supposedly, it would take time for talks to begin. At the talks, Macedonia would have to \"establish that the preconditions for membership have been met\" so there is probably some prep work that might take time. The next question therefore is about the historical base rates for how long it takes for a country to begin talks following an invitation. I have more research to do. For now I am leaning toward 0 since a number of things would have to happen for talks to begin by April and these processes are usually slow.
