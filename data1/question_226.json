Keep in mind that I'm using the 2012 popular vote totals as a benchmark. As I've said elsewhere, if Trump gets 5% more of the white vote that Romney got, he wins even if he loses 10%+ of the Hispanic vote that Romney got. I think Trump will carry most of the Rust Belt, in addition to the states that Romney carried. But it's a matter of distribution. Trump can get very small majorities in the states he turns from Democratic to Republican for this election, but at the same time do very poorly among Hispanic voters in states he has no hope of winning, like California and New Jersey. Trump would still win Texas even if he loses a significant percentage of the Hispanic vote there, but that loss would mean that his national popular vote total would be lower. In other words, he may squeak by to victories in some swing states, and win in states he is expected to carry, albeit with smaller totals, but get utterly clobbered in states where you would expect him to lose anyway. But those minuscule margins in swing states and lower totals in safe Republican states would put him over 270. In fact, I think he could win by a significant electoral margin, and still lose the popular vote by a fraction of a percent. I don't think any of this applies to Clinton.

Andrew Jackson was the winner in both categories. Jackson received 38,000 more popular votes than Adams, and beat him in the electoral vote 99 to 84. Despite his victories, Jackson didn\u2019t reach the majority 131 votes needed in the Electoral College to be declared president. In fact, neither candidate did. The decision went to the House of Representatives, which voted Adams into the White House. In 1876, Rutherford B. Hayes won the election (by a margin of one electoral vote), but he lost the popular vote by more than 250,000 ballots to Samuel J. Tilden. In 1888, Benjamin Harrison received 233 electoral votes to Grover Cleveland\u2019s 168, winning the presidency. But Harrison lost the popular vote by more than 90,000 votes. In 2000, George W. Bush was declared the winner of the general election and became the 43rd president, but he didn\u2019t win the popular vote either. Al Gore holds that distinction, garnering about 540,000 more votes than Bush.

Meanwhile the Democrats have ramped up 8 years of massive investment in electoral data so are likely to over perform electorally relative to the popular vote. This makes a split outcome more likely if the popular vote is won by the Republicans and less likely if it is won by the Democrats.\nSince I only give Trump about 20% chance to win the popular vote, I have to adjust down from the base rate of 4% to 1%. \nRecent polling gives Clinton a 5pt lead nationally, so that makes me comfortable despite the extreme prediction.\nNormally I'd extremise to adjust for the way this prediction market works, but I don't like 100% predictions unless I believe the outcome is settled but not updated by GJO, so I wont extremise in this case.
