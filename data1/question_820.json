The rational sequence should be (a) a country holds a referendum to find out if its voters are minded to leave the EU (or Eurozone) if the answer is \"Yes\" they should continue to (b) which should be negotiations on the Withdrawal and the Future Relationship, when these negotiations are completely agreed then (c) another referendum should be held. This second referendum should be as follows:-\nPlease answer BOTH Questions\nQ1 Do you approve the terms that have been agreed? Y/N\nQ2 If the majority is \"No\", do you want to (a) have the Government Renegotiate OR (b) Remain in the Currant Arrangement. If the majority wants to accept the terms, what ever transition period that was agreed in the negotiations starts at the end of which the country has left the EU (or Eurozone).  I don't accept that Leaving \"without a deal\" is a real option, as no country except maybe North Korea has no international agreements. What is casually referred to as \"a Brexit No Deal\" is not a serious possibility because that would result in no planes to/from the UK and other ridiculous self harms.  The alternative of \"Renegotiate\" would tell the Government to try again to get a consensus. The Government would be free to interpret that as moving closer to a very basic \"WTO\" type deal or closer to a \"Norway +\" type deal, but whatever they opt for would still need to be confirmed when they have the full detail by another referendum. This process would then have to continue until the government had a deal that was acceptable to the majority of voters or the majority of voters decided they would prefer the status quo of Remaining.  It could be argued that this could take a long time and that voters do not want endless referendums, but parliament created the problem by having the 2016 referendum. It would do less harm continuing with referendums until an outcome that is supported by the majority of voters was found than \"compromise\" with an outcome most voters do not want,  Asking people just \"do you want to Leave or Remain\" when there is no certainty as to what the state of Leaving means is like asking \"would you like to go on a trip?\" you might like the idea of going on a trip, you might agree to it, but you can't confirm if you want to really go until you know the destination and conditions. If when you have the details you discover what you imagined was a trip to the beach has turned out to be a trip to a turkey you would entitled to withdraw your agreement to go on the trip. So regarding Brexit and the discussions about a People's Vote, it sounds like a democratic thing to do, but would not really achieve anything if it is held before the Future Framework Political Declaration is turned into a legal agreement. Agreeing to a vague political declaration would lead to the same sort of never ending arguments that have occurred since the statement on the Irish Border was agreed on 8th Dec 2017, which has subsequently been found to mean different things to each side, so was no agreement at all.  Unfortunately the Future Framework will be turned into a Future Legal Agreement only after the UK has left the EU, which means that the option of continuing to be a member of the EU would not (legally) exist (presumably, but not certainty it would be possible to rejoin the EU).  My view is that it would be totally irresponsible for the UK Government to proceed with its current agreement, when all that is certain is the Withdrawal, and the Future Framework is an unclear aspiration that could well never be meet, as to ratify any future agreement requires all 30 national and regional parliaments to agree, By the time any agreement is negotiated many of these bodies will have had elections and changed governments, so even if they are in agreement with the aspirations today they may not agree when there is a legal text.   \n "], [62972, "2018-11-21T18:55:01Z", [0.0], "Insufficient time now for one to be scheduled"], [368, "2018-11-21T18:32:14Z", [0.0], ""], [2965, "2018-11-21T14:39:25Z", [0.0], ""], [62960, "2018-11-21T14:34:07Z", [0.05], "Only likely in the case of Italy, in the event that budget dispute escalates significantly."], [49838, "2018-11-21T02:51:59Z", [0.09], ""], [34821, "2018-11-21T02:17:29Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2018-11-20T17:56:11Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2018-11-20T16:03:24Z", [0.01], ""], [62808, "2018-11-20T15:03:51Z", [0.01], ""], [2965, "2018-11-20T14:22:43Z", [0.0], ""], [29464, "2018-11-20T07:07:07Z", [0.03], ""], [3429, "2018-11-19T20:45:42Z", [0.0], "No, at least not until Brexit resolved."], [368, "2018-11-19T19:49:50Z", [0.0], ""], [10612, "2018-11-19T14:04:47Z", [0.0], ""], [41318, "2018-11-18T23:31:56Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2018-11-18T15:49:54Z", [0.0], ""], [2965, "2018-11-18T15:35:11Z", [0.0], ""], [10612, "2018-11-18T15:34:36Z", [0.0], ""], [49515, "2018-11-18T03:49:58Z", [0.05], "Seeing as how Britain is experiencing regret over leaving the E.U., it would be unlikely that another member would follow in their footsteps barring a spike in populist nationalism."], [373, "2018-11-17T23:29:17Z", [0.05], ""], [35217, "2018-11-17T21:05:55Z", [0.03], ""], [11800, "2018-11-17T20:55:40Z", [0.0], ""], [82, "2018-11-16T22:37:44Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2018-11-16T20:36:24Z", [0.0], ""], [1333, "2018-11-16T15:28:29Z", [0.0], ""], [2965, "2018-11-16T14:35:31Z", [0.0], "May is a dead man walking"], [30389, "2018-11-16T10:58:59Z", [0.0], ""], [62731, "2018-11-16T04:52:25Z", [0.01], ""], [691, "2018-11-15T16:40:48Z", [0.01], ""], [21884, "2018-11-15T05:28:53Z", [0.0], ""], [2965, "2018-11-14T23:29:33Z", [0.0], ""], [31679, "2018-11-14T20:20:24Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2018-11-14T20:01:13Z", [0.0], ""], [34376, "2018-11-14T10:18:37Z", [0.01], ""], [46029, "2018-11-14T03:58:24Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2018-11-13T19:42:03Z", [0.0], ""], [31410, "2018-11-13T18:30:25Z", [0.0], ""], [14847, "2018-11-13T17:31:36Z", [0.0], "See Ken's comment on Nov 11, 2018 07:46PM for a good explanation.

Below it is a quotation from the Koran: \u201cWe belong to God and to Him we shall return.\u201d The grave was dug for 28-year-old Mohamed Fofana from Guinea, who died of hypothermia in May after he and a companion were turned back by police as they tried to reach France near the Col de l\u2019\u00c9chelle pass, 1,762 metres up in the Alps. It is ironic. While Italy\u2019s interior minister, Matteo Salvini, continues to focus public attention, and anger, on a drastically reduced volume of migrants arriving in Italy from across the Mediterranean, comparable numbers are risking their lives to leave Italy for other countries\u2014secondary migration, in the official jargon. By October 30th Mr Salvini\u2019s own ministry had recorded 22,031 arrivals by sea this year\u2014a drop of 88% on the same period in 2017. The drop is largely owing to agreements reached between Italy\u2019s previous, centre-left administration and the un-recognised government in Tripoli that bolstered the ability of Libyan coastguards to intercept and return departing asylum-seekers. The Italian authorities are also suspected of having made secret deals with some of the militias in Libya involved in people-smuggling. The main effect has been to divert the flow of west African migrants to Spain, which so far this year has had more than twice as many arrivals as Italy. The real challenge for the government in Rome is what to do with several hundred thousand migrants already in Italy, many reluctantly so. Since 1997 the rule in the European Union has been that the first country in which an asylum-seeker\u2019s application is submitted or fingerprints taken should be the one that deals with him or her. With its persistently low economic growth, Italy had little to offer migrants even before Mr Salvini came into office in May. Many of the newcomers, moreover, had linguistic and cultural or family ties with other countries in Europe. For years, Italian officials quietly let new arrivals slip away without identifying or registering them so that they could ask for asylum elsewhere. But starting in late 2015, France, Austria and Switzerland tightened border controls, causing a build-up in Italy. Around 160,000 are currently in the Italian reception system\u2014living in camps, hostels or accommodation supplied by local authorities in exchange for payment by the central government. Estimates of how many others are outside it, having avoided identification or failed to obtain humanitarian protection, range from 300,000 to 500,000. There is hardly a supermarket or bar in Italy\u2019s bigger cities without a forlorn African begging at the door. With the border crossings to Austria and Switzerland now tightly controlled, and the coastal route into France near Ventimiglia in effect sealed, virtually the only way to escape from Italy is over the Alps. But with winter again setting in, it becomes a perilous undertaking. Paolo Narciso heads a humanitarian ngo, Rainbow4Africa, which runs a shelter in Bardonecchia. He reckons that some 30-40 migrants a night had been getting through in the good weather, though these numbers will fall in winter. That broadly squares with figures given by Michel Rousseau of another ngo, Tous Migrants. Its reception centre in Brian\u00e7on, on the other side of the Alps in France, provided shelter to more than 5,000 people in the 13 months to the end of July. But Mr Rousseau cautions that several other centres exist and some of those who get to France do not go to any of them anyway. \u201cThe best prepared are the Afghans,\u201d says Dr Narciso. \u201cPeople from the desert don\u2019t have the least idea of what snow is and what it can do.\u201d Even in the depths of last winter, when temperatures dropped to -20\u00b0C, Africans were turning up in Bardonecchia and setting off on the 17km walk through the mountains in trainers and anoraks. \u201cThey bring them back into the valley half-frozen,\u201d he says. Mr Fofana was one of three migrants who are known to have died this year. A fourth is missing. Locals believe the real death toll is higher.

Yet even intelligent people cling to feeble explanations of why it happened. Remainers present it as a revolt of the know-nothings, despite the fact that a third of graduates voted Leave. Brexiteers counter that it was a revolt of the people against the elites, despite the fact that Brexit was popular among rich retirees in the shires, and that many of the campaign\u2019s leaders went to expensive private schools. Others implausibly cite one-off factors, such as Russian interference or Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Europhobia. Two new books offer much more intelligent explanations of Brexit. They matter\u2014not just because intelligent explanations are preferable to foolish ones, but also because the subject is still a live one, with millions of people hoping to reverse the referendum and the Conservative Party fighting a civil war about what sort of Brexit to embrace. \u201cWhiteshift\u201d, by Eric Kaufmann, is a monumental study of ethno-demographic change and the rise of populism across the rich world. \u201cNational Populism\u201d, by Roger Eatwell and Matthew Goodwin, is a fact-filled survey of the revolt against liberal democracy. Both books range far beyond Brexit and Britain. But in doing so they put a parochial debate in a much bigger context. Mr Kaufmann, a professor at Birkbeck College, London, argues that Brexit is an example of how anti-immigration populism can suddenly punch through from the margins of politics into the mainstream, threatening the economic interests that cosmopolitan elites care about. The foreign-born share of Britain\u2019s population remained under 2% until the 1950s and stood at 6% as recently as 1991. Then a number of things happened. Immigration surged. The Labour government tried to redefine Britishness to mean support for cosmopolitan liberalism (according to Andrew Neather, one of Tony Blair\u2019s speechwriters, some in the party wanted to use mass immigration to \u201crub the Right\u2019s nose in diversity and render their arguments out of date\u201d). The attacks of September 11th 2001 and July 7th 2005 put the question of Islamist terrorism at the heart of politics. Successive governments failed to keep their promises to reduce immigration. And a long-simmering row within the Conservative Party triggered a referendum on Brexit that also involved profound issues of national identity, giving voters a unique opportunity to express worries that had been festering for decades. A poll two months after the referendum showed that 87% of Leavers wanted to reduce immigration and 40% thought it the top issue facing the country. Mr Kaufmann\u2019s decision to focus on \u201cwhiteness\u201d is questionable when it comes to understanding Brexit and perhaps even when it comes to understanding Trumpism (28% of Latinos voted for Donald Trump in 2016). The big surge in immigration after 2004 came from whites, when eight eastern European countries were admitted to the European Union. Large numbers of south Asians in places such as Birmingham, Bradford, Luton and Slough voted for Brexit because they worried that Poles and Romanians were taking \u201ctheir\u201d jobs and using \u201ctheir\u201d public services. But Mr Kaufmann is undoubtedly right that it is impossible to understand Brexit\u2014or populism in general\u2014without examining the way that mass immigration has discombobulated established populations. Messrs Eatwell and Goodwin also emphasise the importance of immigration, which they somewhat ominously classify under \u201cdestruction\u201d, one of four Ds that they believe explain populism. The second is distrust, of established elites. Some 58% of Britons who thought that politicians \u201cdo not listen to people like me\u201d voted for Brexit, compared with only 37% of people who thought they did listen. About 2.8m habitual non-voters, who had given up on politics during the Blair-Cameron years of identikit politicians with interchangeable policies, turned out to vote Leave. The third D is deprivation. It is important not to exaggerate this problem. Many people, rich and poor, voted for Brexit because they worried about democracy and accountability. But a growing feeling of both absolute and relative deprivation nevertheless tipped the balance for significant groups of voters, particularly in Labour territory, where local mps fought a losing battle against the Brexit tide. The fourth D is the \u201cdealignment\u201d of politics, meaning the abandonment by voters of their usual party. This is the most counterintuitive of the authors\u2019 claims when it comes to Britain. In the election last year, Labour and the Tories won 82% of the vote, their highest share since 1970. But the potential for dealignment is there. In 2015 and 2017, 43% and 32% of voters respectively changed their votes from the previous election. Brexit cuts like a knife through both main parties: Labour represents the most passionately pro-Remain constituencies in the country and the most passionately pro-Brexit ones. The revolts to come\nWhat does this mass of research tell us about the future? An immediate lesson is that the political elite should not take the decision to re-fight the 2016 referendum lightly if the opportunity presents itself. Millions of people who voted for Brexit precisely because they felt that their opinions were being ignored by the establishment could be dangerously radicalised if a second vote went narrowly in favour of Remain. A longer-term lesson is that, Brexit or no Brexit, nationalist populism will be an important part of British politics for decades. Many feel the odds are stacked against them. The post-industrial economy combines large amounts of disruption with slow growth. Culture is dominated by preening elites who not only think they are cleverer than the average person but also that they are more virtuous. Brexit is an example of what can happen if politicians refuse to deal with popular fears about emotive subjects before they become toxic. It is vital that the political class, not just in London but across the West, and not just in legislatures but among the broader establishment, learns the right lessons from this failure."], [61890, "2018-11-02T16:30:35Z", [0.16], ""], [10612, "2018-11-02T14:50:26Z", [0.0], ""], [61847, "2018-11-02T08:26:34Z", [0.02], ""], [61869, "2018-11-01T23:05:53Z", [0.55], "Italy"], [368, "2018-11-01T22:05:23Z", [0.0], ""], [34886, "2018-11-01T20:18:58Z", [0.04], ""], [61847, "2018-11-01T19:58:38Z", [0.03], ""], [61391, "2018-11-01T19:11:36Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2018-11-01T18:36:58Z", [0.01], ""], [61862, "2018-11-01T17:15:22Z", [0.05], "Only Italy really seems keen and the chaos would be much later than the UK."], [61847, "2018-10-31T21:19:03Z", [0.05], ""], [60810, "2018-10-31T20:48:20Z", [0.0], "Within the next few months, I do not see any other EU member announcing to leave the EU.

So I can imagine how they would feel about something akin to Brexit negotiations and dropping out of the euro. I also can't easily conceive Hungarian or Polish voters favoring it (though I feel less aware of their inclinations). Since nationalist politicians leading all 3 (in coalition in Italy, but seemingly guiding the course in foreign & security issues) must know this, I doubt they would call a referendum. And I don't see a reason for them to call a referendum expected to fail. It's conceivable that Macron and Merkel lead the non-nationalist majority of EU governments in trying to press the nationalist governments hard on something (e.g. the budget is majority vote), leading to a referendum being called out of spite, but I suspect Macron and Merkel (or her successor) would prefer to wait out Trump to do such a thing.

For example one person gave her reasons as \"because the old people fought in the war\" and \"because of the cheaper blueberries\". I had not heard anyone campaigning with any message that the EU was linked to any issue about the war (which war? WW2?) or the blueberries. So I dismissed the woman's reasons. But now I have seen the samples of  ads that were run on Facebook by Vote Leave I can see how her reasons might make sense (to her).\nI had, arrogantly thought that seeing a few more adverts saying Vote for Brexit using the same arguments that I had seen were unlikely to have made much difference to the vote. But these targeted Facebook adverts are nothing like the mainstream adverts. They have pictures of cups of tea, polar bears, bull fight etc. with the suggestion that the EU is tying to stop Brits drinking tea and is blocking the UK from helping to save polar bears and encouraging bull fights. It seems there were 1433 different targeted adverts. Obviously I have not seen them all, but it seems very possible that some of them could have shown an old person or a picture of the Battle of Britain and suggesting that remaining in the EU was letting the fighters down, it seems quite possible that another of the 1433 was promoting the idea that somehow blueberries would be cheaper after Brexit. \nThe fact that the Leave voter quoted the reasons she did, strongly suggests she had seen an advert telling her to vote that way. The reasons that were passed on to me as to why other Leave voters voted how they did also often seemed odd, but I had assumed the voters were just misunderstanding the arguments, not being fed pure fantasy. I know that at least some (older) voters who were getting all their news via social media  So I have changed my mind and now think these adverts could very well have changed the outcome of the vote.   \nAs it seems that the source of money that paid for the adverts is questionable it does look as if the result is compromised (Ignoring the over spending) an investigation similar to the USA Mueller Investigation is needed.   https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-44966969"], [1333, "2018-07-29T14:28:54Z", [0.08], ""], [691, "2018-07-29T11:47:03Z", [0.02], ""], [24162, "2018-07-29T11:06:15Z", [0.03], ""], [1333, "2018-07-28T22:06:13Z", [0.09], ""], [32300, "2018-07-28T21:21:58Z", [0.02], ""], [60024, "2018-07-28T20:55:20Z", [0.03], "Italy is a candidate plus and unknown country on Northern Europe win by eurosceptic mayority "], [368, "2018-07-28T20:51:44Z", [0.0], ""], [37379, "2018-07-28T19:45:08Z", [0.0], "Given the sufferings of May, no other nations appear to be queuing up for such an ordeal."], [47482, "2018-07-28T12:59:58Z", [0.02], "Affirming"], [35683, "2018-07-28T12:04:29Z", [0.01], ""], [4688, "2018-07-28T10:21:45Z", [0.05], ""], [4688, "2018-07-28T10:21:19Z", [0.1], ""], [368, "2018-07-27T19:15:46Z", [0.0], ""], [60010, "2018-07-27T12:54:55Z", [0.1], "It's very unlikely considering the current state of Brexit.\nOn the other hand, there is Greece..."], [14493, "2018-07-27T09:46:11Z", [0.0], "Other EU countries will be watching how Mrs May's new Brexit plan gets on in negotiations of the EU,\nIt seems the British have always thought that the EU Nation States will agree to May's form of Brexit and force the EU Commission to agree as well. \nSpeaking to Brexit supporting members of the public I am being told that they expect that the EU States (not Commission) is about to fold and give the UK the deal it wants (previously described by Boris Johnson as \"having cake and eating it\".)

When the head of the Budget Committee says things like this, its a matter of when not if. It also seems there is pressure on the pro-european Finance Minister Giovanni Tria, to resign. As a prelude to...what? If the date of the above question was 01/01/20 then I would suggest the probability of a referendum is high; however, for a referendum to be called in Italy (the most likely candidate to do so) in the next 4 months, a very rapid and significant deterioration would have to take place. This is certainly not out of the question as there are a number of clouds gathering on the horizon: A) General economic headwinds are getting stronger due to President Trump's apparent decision to slap tariffs on a further $505 billion dollars worth of Chinese imports and the fact that quantitative easing is coming to an end in the Euro zone and the US B) Specifically EU-centric problems are reflected in the fact that the Target 2 imbalances look as if they are going to breach the 1 trillion euro mark in favour of the North Europeans; the growth seems to be an indication of capital flight from Italy according to recent data. In addition, Italian banks are now in a very precarious state (i will give details later). In sum, the economic situation across the world seems to be deteriorating, with the Italian context particularly vulnerable and already showing signs of capital flight. However, on a logical level, if the Italians were to leave the Euro, they would not advertise it in advance through a referendum (indeed Brexit has shown that referendums can mean that the political leadership loses control of the process). Therefore to avoid the sheer chaos that would ensue should Italy leave the euro, the would announce it retrospectively. So, according to this logic, the chances of a referendum are zero. However, there is some speculation that a parallel currency could be launched which would avoid too much disruption. In this event I would presume some form of legitimacy would be needed, so a referendum is a possibility. It\u2019s likelihood depends on the economic landscape, which as I say, is becoming more negative. In sum, I think there is a low but noteworthy probability that a referendum will be announced.

Many of these friends are in the UK. A No Deal Brexit is one possibility.  \n Logically you should hope for the Best, plan for the Worse. So even though it would be clearly stupid to have a real No Deal (for the UK and EU) we should all as far as we can afford prepare for No Deal. We know what the worst No Deal would look like, or if we are not thinkers we can read what the EU and British Governments say a No Deal could be like. But we are very reluctant to allow ourselves to recognize that No Deal is possible, even though rationally we know quite well it is possible because about 28% of the public tell pollsters that's what they want and every day MPs tell us they want No Deal. The problem is not unique to Brexit, history has many examples of situations where people chose to ignore evidence that suggested an really bad outcome was possible if they did not take some action to protect themselves, but people did not take the action because they (presumably) thought that the bad outcome was so bad that other people would ensure that it did not happen. For example many wars start way. No sane person would have started World War I, but the actions of many sane people did start World War I. So, even though I think a No Deal Brexit is very unlikely (because deep inside I can't accept that people would be so stupid) should I advise my friends in the UK to stock up on necessities so that if the UK Government forecasts are right, that shops will run out of foods and drugs in the first few days after 29th March 2019 as transport get clogged up in delays in the ports etc., or should I just get my own stock pile of necessities?  Or pretend that I live in a dream world where people don't make stupid decisions? The cost of stocking up with non-perishable foods, batteries etc. to last for two or three months is not huge.

With a new agreement being reached in the Brexit negotiations regarding the period in which the United Kingdom will officially leave the EU, and additional negotiations being planned to address future relations and trade, Brexit continues to serve as a successful example of a nation withdrawing from the EU. This, in combination with the rising populist sentiment across Europe makes it possible for another country to potentially leave the EU.

Many like to follow the example of Brexit, however, it should be noted that the United Kingdom was in a unique position within the European Union. The UK was granted many opt outs in areas such as the Eurozone, Schengen, and the charter of fundamental rights. Therefore, the UK was not well integrated within the EU paradigm which made its exit relatively easy, and was boosted by its large economy. Nearly all other Euroskeptic countries are part of both the Eurozone and Schengen, and their exit would create massive disruptions for their societies. The Pew Research Center has also conducted a major study and has found that nearly a year after the Brexit vote, the view of the EU has become more positive and there is not widespread appetite for leaving the Union. However, Pew research notes that there is a slight increase in citizens who want a referendum on membership. However, it is still not a considerable majority and the governments face no pressure to implement a referendum, especially more Euroskeptic countries in the V4, who still rely on EU funds for their economy. However, there is still a concern over Greece, as the Greek economy has still not properly recovered from the Eurozone crisis. The Euro is also a culprit in holding back Greece, as they cannot rely on their own national currency, the drachma, to drop in value and make their exports more competitive and help alleviate some of the economic issues. The Greek people also despise the austerity measures imposed upon them by the IMF and the EU, and have elected a new government in 2015 in the hopes of ending the measures, but to little avail. If the issue is not resolved soon, there could be a desperate push for a referendum, but there is still a debate of whether the benefits outweigh the costs.  https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-eu-david-davis-other-countries-next-leave-a7836021.html\nhttp://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36247456\nhttp://www.pewglobal.org/2017/06/15/post-brexit-europeans-more-favorable-toward-eu/\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/business/international/greece-debt-crisis-euro.html"], [56405, "2018-03-20T02:25:53Z", [0.03], "Of the countries still in the Eurozone the most divisive issues have not been unfair wealth distribution issues which triggered Brexit, but personal ownership of firearms where countries who came out of communism are much more likely to resist a Eurozone wide gun control scheme, however I do not anticipate that this issue will rise to the level of a \"Czechout\" or other such action as each sovereign nation maintains other legal mechanisms to protect gun rights of their citizens (such as declare all citizens members of the militia who are authorized to outfit themselves with necessary arms and provisions)."], [49298, "2018-03-19T20:44:04Z", [0.11], "I think that overall it is unlikely that an EU member state will schedule a referendum on leaving the EU or eurozone before 1 January 2019 because that is a relatively short time frame. However, the continued rise of populism in Europe and some recent developments in Brexit negotiations render it possible. The world has seen many European populist movements arise and gain popularity in Europe over the past few years. Most recently in early March Italian elections, a majority of votes went to the Five Star Movement, which is willing to work alongside other far right parties against the euro and immigration in Italy. Further, in Brexit negotiations a new agreement has been reached regarding the transition period in which the UK will officially leave the EU and the two parties will begin negotiating trade and future relations. As long as populist movements continue to rise in European countries and the UK provides a successful model for leaving the EU, it is possible that another country will schedule a referendum to leave. However given the short time frame I feel that it is very unlikely in the near future, although in the long-term I believe it is highly likely other countries will attempt to leave the EU.  https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/world/europe/luigi-di-maio-five-star-italy-election.html\nhttps://www.chathamhouse.org/expert/comment/2018-europe-s-populist-challenges-will-continue\nhttp://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43463196"], [56662, "2018-03-19T20:42:52Z", [0.2], ""], [56656, "2018-03-19T18:59:36Z", [0.15], ""], [56620, "2018-03-19T17:37:44Z", [0.5], "Over immigration perhaps.

Lega Nord and Fivestar are in talks but Fabrizio Nusca might have too big a head to effectively form a government/Lega Nord & Fivestar can tend to be a bit buck in diplomacy with other parties, though they seem like pretty effective bedfellows.\n-Most of this downgrade is that even if Fivestar and Legua Nord get in coalition together (two quite Euroskeptic parties running a government) they do they probably have bigger fish to fry in terms of immigration (though that does tend to come back around the EU) and other policy/corruption issues. Also Italy tends to benefit from the EU more than the UK (including getting money to help with the immigrants, though many also feel it also stops Italy from doing the more aggressive actions some want). Italy also benefits more economically as it is one the weaker big partners with its odd quality luxury good economy in the EU/Eurozone (AKA sick man of Europe) but I wouldn't underestimate the rigidity of populist politics even in the face of sizable economic harm.\n-Even if a majority Eurosceptic government gets into power in Italy they will have a lot to deal with internally and that those factors that deal with the EU they will at least give nominal if not real discussion with the EU to change those policies to benefit Italy (and other nations like Italy).\n-There is a not insubstantial chance that Italy will be able to rally the other countries in the EU wary of the \u201cever centralizing\u201d status quo of the EU to make a substantial shift in the tenor of the EU as a whole (though I suspect this will be fought by the European Commission, so it would probably take both the parliament and Council to move the needle which would be hard).\n-Finally even if they don\u2019t get any or any substantial amount of their demands met there is a small to medium chance that they will remain in the EU/Eurozone just because it\u2019s better than leaving.

At the time of the UK's referendum, there was a lot of buzz concerning various countries that might leave next ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/27/frexit-nexit-or-oexit-who-will-be-next-to-leave-the-eu ). For each country listed in that source, these are the most recent developments: FRANCE: January 2018 Macron tells the BBC that he thinks the French people would vote to leave if they were given the opportunity. As Macron is pro EU, he is less likely to hold a referendum if he believes this. On the other hand, Macron has in the past made statements calling for the EU to \"reform or face Frexit\" ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-39766334 ). So on balance, France's likelihood of leaving via referendum is low but not impossible. Chance: ~2% DENMARK: relatively little information, but Denmark has a history of opposing EU involvement and voting against a more involved EU. ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/denmark/12032958/Denmarks-EU-referendum-is-a-blow-to-David-Cameron.html ). In 2011, the European Commission warned Denmark over the tightening of its borders. Although not much info available now, keeping an eye on Denmark is important with regards to this Q. Chance: ~1%. GERMANY: politics is currently tumultuous in Germany after an indeterminate 2017 election ( https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21731663-break-up-coalition-talks-leads-country-uncharted-territory-break-up?zid=307&ah=5e80419d1bc9821ebe173f4f0f060a07 ). Merkel et al are Europhiles, so will endeavour to resist in spite of this. Chance: ~1%. SWEDEN: both the far left (The Left Party) and the far right (Sweden Democrats) campaign for EU exit in Sweden, but there isn't much of a buzz in mainstream Swedish politics. Chance: ~0.5%. AUSTRIA: this month, there have been protests and counter protests in Austria ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-42841041 ). Additionally, a strongly anti immigration party (Freedom Party) actually have political power in Austria as part of a coalition ( http://www.euronews.com/2018/01/05/how-contagious-will-austrias-politics-be-in-2018 ). This suggests that Austria is one of the more likely countries to end up having a referendum over EU membership, although the discussion hitherto seems more focused on the sort of border controls legislators in Austria will implement. Chance: ~3%. ITALY: relatively little info to be found on Italy suggests that an exit is not in the public imagination right now, despite a precarious economy. Even Italy's far right movements believe the country should retain EU membership ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/19/no-eu-exit-for-us-say-italys-on-the-rise-eurosceptics ). Tensions surrounding the lack of help Italy has received from the EU in the wake of its financial crisis might be the only force that could propel Italy towards an exit. Chance: ~0.5% NETHERLANDS: in their 2017 general election, the incumbent prime minister lost ground to Geert Wilder's eurosceptic party, but still maintained a majority. More so than other nations, the Netherlands have an economy heavily reliant upon imports and exports ( https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21718520-netherlands-more-risk-most-brexit-and-protectionism-retreat ), making a decision for them to leave particularly dangerous for their economy.

Actually leaving the EU is a way to get any government so tied up in knots that no one would want to be in a government attempting it.  Leaving the eurozone would be even more difficult. So no EU country's government would, however populist, call a referendum on leaving the EU or eurozone if they thought there was any likelihood of voters choosing to Leave. Since the UK Conservative government miscalculated  and called a referendum which it then lost (they thought Remain would easily win) I would expect other country's governments to learn from the UK's mistake. \nOther populist movements that are not in government will have noticed that in the UK, UKIP appeared to be political force and certainly influenced UK government policy without being in government because it could make all sorts of claims about the supposed benefits of leaving the EU, but as soon as the referendum was won by Leave, UKIP's support faded and 18 months later it has virtually disappeared. The lesson seems to be that populists ideas, particularly anti-EU ideas, will appeal to a sizable proportion of voters, specifically those who do not want to think through the consequences, but if these ideas cannot be turned into easy to implement actions that do not cause any negative consequence for their supporters, the populists supporters will melt away.    \nSo my conclusion is that as far as calling for anti-EU referendums is concerned, for populists, its better to get your supports to believe voting for you is a way of traveling hopefully toward Leaving, but be very sure there is no danger of arriving.  Scheduling a referendum would therefore be a very big mistake.

These are two separate but related issues.\nWith regards to the Eurozone, there is different opinion on whether or not leaving the euro currency is legal and (since the crash of 2007/8) the eurozone itself has established a number of new provisions and the funding for emergency loans which makes the likelihood of a country wishing to leave the euro for economic purposes highly unlikely.  Indeed, any replacement currency would be of low value compared to the euro and is likely to lead to a bank run, divestment and the introduction of capital controls.

There is a very low probability of another EU member state scheduling a referendum in 2018 on either issue for, inter alia, the following reasons: 1. Few larger/medium size political parties in EU countries are (yet) committed to a referendum on EU membership, or very likely to be in government in 2018 (see article at 2. below on Austria where was some low probability). Those that are, are (as yet) mostly on the political fringe (except Italy) - unlike the UK where the ruling Conservative Party committed to scheduling a referendum in order to (successfully) win the 2015 election. Eurosceptic parties will need to become much stronger for EU membership referendums to be scheduled -  either by becoming members of coalitions which commit to a membership referendum, or get the agreement of a government to implement one. In 2018 this is highly unlikely (see 5. below).  2. The EU, pro-EU politicians, and even moderately EU-sceptic politicians will want to avoid the political instability and uncertainty of a referendum on either issue until at least well after the UK leaves in March 2019, especially given that the UK unexpectedly returned a Leave vote. For example the Austrian centre-Right and 'far-Right' Freedom Party have ruled out an EU referendum see: \nhttps://www.rte.ie/news/world/2017/1216/927879-austria-government-ministries/ 3. As was the case in the UK moderate Euroseptic politicians are likely to want to re-negotiate their country's relationship with the EU before any Leave referendum, This would lead to some time lag as to when any Leave referendum was scheduled to take place. UK election was May 2015, scheduled in Feb 216, and referendum took place in June 2016. 4. How the UK performs economically and otherwise outside the EU is unlikely to have any influence on European electorates and politicians attitudes and perceptions of the risks of leaving the EU and/or Euro for some years to come.   5. The EU country electoral cycle in 2019 (only Italy - March, Hungary - April, Slovenia - July, Sweden - Sept,  Luxembourg and Latvia - Oct have national elections) means there are very limited opportunities for referendums on either issue to be a. agreed & b. scheduled to take place by the end of 2018 (given the time lags involved).  For example in Sweden even if a minority centre-right government came to power in Sept '18 depending for some parliamentary support from the nationalist Swedish Democrats that government would most likely seek to re-negotiate the relationship with the EU before the option of scheduling a referendum. In Slovenia, Latvia and Luxembourg the issue is not on the agenda. Amongst EU states with elections only Hungary and Italy have elections early enough in the year for it to be even possible for a referendum to be scheduled on either issue before 2019. The ruling party in Hungary though Euro-sceptic does not was a referendum on either issue, nor do the main opposition parties to their left. Italy seems to be the only (very low) possibility for referendum on euro membership ito be scheduled in 2018 (see 6. below). 6. Only in Italy, which has a weak Euro-constrained economy, and elections in March does it seem possible there may be scheduled a referendum on the Euro in 2018. 4 of the 6 largest Italian parties with 62.6% of support in opinion polls are eurosceptic to varying degrees. There has been discussion on issuing a parallel currency to the euro, but this would not involve Italy leaving the eurozone entirely. The 5-Star Movement floated the idea of a non-binding referendum (for constitutional reasons) on Euro membership and the (much smaller) Northen League wants to leave it. It is highly unlikely that the 5-Star Movement would form an alliance with the centre-right/right parties. A weak minority Italian government of the centre-left or centre-right is unlikely to call a referendum on the euro if it can avoid it given the large-scale economic and political difficulties that would ensue. However this possibility cannot be completely excluded if economic and social conditions suddenly decline in Italy in 2018.\nSee: https://www.forbes.com/sites/stratfor/2017/07/25/italy-looms-on-the-eurozones-horizon/2/#42ed45e673fd 7, The world economy is growing quite strongly, eurozone economies are performing reasonably well at present due to quantitative easing, and this makes a referendum on euro membership less likely for the time being. However it cannot be excluded that a major economic shock in 2018 may precipitate large-scale economic difficulties in the southern Eurozone, notably Italy. It is always possible therefore that a Eurozone country with a weak economy may leave the euro with, or without a referendum at some point, though it is unlikely to be within next year. Due to 6. & 7. and factors which are unpredictable, unknown, or unknowable there is therefore some very low probablity of a referendum being scheduled on either issue, though higher on euro membership than EU membership."], [47502, "2018-01-08T00:14:32Z", [0.78], "Northern Europe is tired of paying the bills, and southern Europe is foolish enough to think they can do better of credit they are unworthy of receiviing,"], [47499, "2018-01-08T00:07:34Z", [0.09], "money. german money"], [36697, "2018-01-07T23:42:16Z", [0.1], ""], [19340, "2018-01-07T23:34:50Z", [0.0], ""], [47478, "2018-01-07T23:11:54Z", [0.15], "EU membership is a strength.

Of these 27 member states, there are 19 eurozone members. The first thing to note is that in the history of the EU since 1992, the UK is the only country to have a referendum on membership of the EU, which makes it an inherently unlikely event (i.e. in only 1 out of 25 years of the EU, has there been a membership referendum, and in 0 out of 18 years of the euro has there been a eurozone referendum). The preconditions for a referendum are: a Government willing to hold a referendum (or other constitutional means such as a petition, depending on the country in question) and a significant proportion of the population dissatisfied with EU/euro membership. According to the most recent Eurobarometer polling, the following countries have populations of over 25% who have a negative image of the EU: Cyprus, Czech Republic, Greece, France and Austria. Greece's very high showing of 43% in particular should be noted. For the equivalent question on the euro, the following countries have over 25% who do not support the euro: Italy, Cyprus, Greece, Lithuania, Austria and France. Of the countries identified, it is important to analyse the Government's position in 2018 and their likelihood of holding a referendum on either the EU or the euro:\nFrance - led by a very pro-EU centrist (Macron). Likelihood of referendum: c.0%\nLithuania - the centre-right Government is moderately pro-EU and is facing no calls for a referendum. Likelihood: c. 0%\nItaly - Elections due this year, with three substantial parties all demonstrating Eurosceptic tendencies (Five Star Movement, Northern League, Forza Italia). None of them is currently calling for a referendum, though both 5SM and NL have done so before. If the centre-left PD gets back into power, it will in all likelihood rule out a referendum outright. Even if a coalition of the Eurosceptics forms, they will probably not hold a referendum or push for concessions over several years before calling one. Likelihood: c.5%\nAustria - a newly elected coalition of the centre-right and populist right, which has nevertheless ruled out an EU referendum for the near future (https://www.rte.ie/news/world/2017/1216/927879-austria-government-ministries/). Likelihood: c.0%\nCzech Republic - Elections have shown success for populist parties, but even winner ANO cannot form a coalition because of its opposition to an EU referendum, which was the demand of the SPD. A deadlock could bring this issue to the fore again. Likelihood: c.5%\nCyprus - With elections due this year, all the prominent candidates are moderately pro-EU and are not campaigning for a referendum. Likelihood: c.0%\nGreece - the Syriza Government flirted heavily with the idea of leaving the euro and held a referendum to oppose the \"Troika\" debt plan, which may well have caused Greece to leave the euro. Since then, it has capitulated losing most of the anti-euro left to rival Popular Unity. Likelihood: c. 5%. In conclusion, of the 27 remaining EU countries, there are seven with significant anti-EU/euro sentiment but only three with any realistic prospect of holding a referendum, which even then would need significant changes in the position of the Government or incoming Government.

What groups have an interest in leaving the EU for what reasons?\n1.1 What are the benefits of leaving the EU/the Eurozone? \n1.2 What are beneficial exit strategies after leaving the EU/the Eurozone? 2. Where is the public opinion so deteriated towards the EU that a referendum would be backed by influential parts of the population? 3. Who has the power to initiate a referendum?\n3.1 Which power elites exerts enough influence on the decision makers in pushing such an endeavour?\n3.2 What are the constitutional limits of scheduling a referendum?\n\nWhile it is quite clear who are the proponents of a referendum on the political stage (right-wing populists; left-wing populist are not as outspoken as they have been lately and largely consider the European project 'just' as defect), it seems unlikely that they are able to offer a credible alternative to the EU and its economic benefits. That is because a reliable and beneficial exit strategy is not in sight. There are reasons the governments of neither Hungary nor Poland want to leave the EU (turning to Russia is not a real option; turning to China may be but would lead to a possible even more dependency). Brexit is a mess as everyone can see.\nWhen it comes to the Eurozone, a referendum now seems quite late. Again, there are good reasons even critics in the states that suffered from austerity are not up to leave the Euro. Addressing the second question there are populations that are critical of the EU, especially in those states where there is a different opinion on dealing with the migration crisis and economics. While the former still is a critical issue, the latter has not been solved yet but there are signs of easing. The following questions are those where it gets particularly messy because there is an extraordinary lack of information on my side. Obviously, there are the usual suspects but even if they have in interest in leaving the EU: how does it play out? I don't know. To sum up: Considering the current situation a referendum is not likely to be scheduled. Still I'm obviously lacking information and knowledge so I need to arrange my forecast. That is most of all connected to my defective understanding of the situation in the Member States in central Europe (Visegrad Group).
