Although he is a an Islamic man, he;s personal beliefs don't interfere with the well being of others, even of a different culture.

Goldsmith will be up in the next polls and Khan will be down. SECURITY\nThe Comres article shows that security is a concern - that poll was taken before the Brussels Airport and Transit attacks.  In my opinion Londoners will be even more concerned about security issues now.  ZG polls better on \"keeping London Safe\" ZG 31% to SK 24%.  \nWhat does this mean?  Goldsmith will be up in the next polls and Khan will be down. TRANSIT\nLondon Transit is a one of the top priorities for voters.  Sadiq Khan plans to freeze bus and tube fares.  While ZG plans to raise fares and invest in Transit. It is by no means certain.\nWhat does this mean?  Khan will be down up the next polls and Goldsmith will be down. CAMPAIGNING\nLast week I reported that Zac Goldsmith, has tried to link himself to Modi to influence Indian voters.  This week in the news, he has been accused of racially profiling voters by leafleting with message of \"The Gujarati community makes London great. Closer ties between the UK and India have been a priority for me as prime minister\".  These leaflets seems to have backfired, and recipients have taken to social media to protest.\nBoth candidates are under scrutiny for campaign donations - Sadik Khan is worse on this issue.\nWhat does this mean? No change.  Constituents will consider this as politicians being politicians. SUMMARY\nTaken together as a body - I think the next polls will show that this race is tighter than it looks right now.\nI am bringing my prediction down to 60-40 (instead of 85-15).  I am still siding on the side of Khan because he is labor and London voters are by and large labor voters.   http://www.paddypower.com/bet/politics/other-politics/london-mayor\nhttp://www.comres.co.uk/polls/itv-london-lbc-london-mayoral-poll-march-2016/\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/mayor-of-london-race-zac-goldsmith-on-tfl-fares-2016-3?r=UK&IR=T\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/30/zac-goldsmith-promises-investment-in-londons-transport-if-elected-mayor\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/zac-goldsmith-accused-of-racial-profiling-voters-again-in-london-mayor-campaign-a6956556.html\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/mar/23/london-mayor-race-goldsmith-campaign-embarrassment-by-its-leaflets-aimed-at-indians\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/zac-goldsmith-accused-of-racial-profiling-voters-again-in-london-mayor-campaign-a6956556.html\nhttp://www.thelondoneconomic.com/news/social-media-data-shows-swing-to-goldsmith/01/04/\nhttp://www.standard.co.uk/news/mayor/sadiq-khans-record-on-donations-even-worse-than-zac-goldsmiths-a3214111.html"], [8605, "2016-04-01T19:32:08Z", [0.2, 0.3, 0.5], ""], [1367, "2016-04-01T16:20:28Z", [0.85, 0.0, 0.15], ""], [18888, "2016-04-01T14:44:11Z", [0.95, 0.0, 0.05], "New poll (http://www.comres.co.uk/polls/itv-london-lbc-london-mayoral-poll-march-2016/), similar results to before: http://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/163208 Gap closed slightly, but still outside MOE of 2.8."], [23355, "2016-04-01T13:22:47Z", [0.2, 0.0, 0.8], ""], [691, "2016-04-01T12:41:37Z", [0.95, 0.0, 0.05], ""], [22038, "2016-04-01T12:23:18Z", [0.49, 0.03, 0.48], ""], [241, "2016-04-01T10:30:00Z", [0.6, 0.0, 0.4], ""], [11080, "2016-04-01T06:52:22Z", [0.76, 0.0, 0.24], ""], [10924, "2016-04-01T06:50:25Z", [0.85, 0.0, 0.15], ""], [241, "2016-04-01T03:56:54Z", [0.65, 0.0, 0.35], ""], [10267, "2016-04-01T03:44:46Z", [0.95, 0.0, 0.05], ""], [19170, "2016-04-01T00:47:01Z", [0.8, 0.0, 0.2], ""], [10898, "2016-03-31T23:28:10Z", [0.82, 0.0, 0.18], ""], [12721, "2016-03-31T21:02:07Z", [0.76, 0.0, 0.24], ""], [368, "2016-03-31T19:49:51Z", [0.98, 0.0, 0.02], ""], [691, "2016-03-31T13:40:47Z", [0.95, 0.0, 0.05], ""], [10267, "2016-03-31T04:44:55Z", [0.95, 0.0, 0.05], ""], [498, "2016-03-30T23:14:02Z", [0.34, 0.0, 0.66], "I've only caught 2-3 extended interviews with Khan on TV, but I must say that a) he did not comport himself as well as I had expected, and b) the interviewers, intentionally or otherwise, had him on the defensive and he had no good answers.

I also see SK's working class background and ethnicity as advantageous traits for garnering additional popular support, and a factor in mobilizing otherwise apathetic voters, at the same time, ZG's socio-economic background may isolate him from voters who do not share the same privileges, in combination, I assign a higher likelihood (5%) of SK's election.\nIn terms of policy, SK's platform seem more comprehensive and detailed, and aim more towards affordability; ZG's seem more abbreviated, for anyone who actually look at the policies to make a decision, I think a better laid out plan would appeal to a completely neutral voter (2% for SK?).

Jan 10: \"London mayor race: can Zac Goldsmith catch Sadiq Khan?\" --> http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/jan/10/london-mayor-race-can-zac-goldsmith-catch-sadiq-khan Were you entering the New Year hoping to become London\u2019s next mayor, you\u2019d almost certainly want to be Sadiq Khan. An array of polls, pundits and bookmakers are predicting that the Labour candidate will succeed Boris Johnson following the election on 5 May while none are doing the same for the only one of his rivals with a realistic chance of beating him, the Conservative Zac Goldsmith.  While Khan has given the impression of covering every angle with know-how and energy, the Goldsmith campaign has, by comparison, looked lethargic and at times ill-judged. The latest voter survey, by YouGov for LBC, gave the Labour man a ten-point lead over the Tory when respondents were invited to pick between just the two of them, an increase of four points from when the same company last asked the same question towards the end of November. Back in October, the pair were neck and neck by that measure.  The signs, then, are that Khan is on course for victory. But there\u2019s a long way still to go and a wide range of reasons why the outcome of this year\u2019s race for City Hall is hard to foresee with certainty. It already looks very different from those that have gone before and part of its fascination is the constellation of factors that could affect the contest either way.\n[...]\nElection analyst Lewis Baston has written: \u201cFor Goldsmith to win, one of two things has to happen \u2013 either he manages what Johnson did and gets a vote that a \u2018generic Tory\u2019 could not win, or Labour\u2019s national popularity collapses.\u201d He tells me he thinks Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader is likely to continue to play better in London than in the rest of the country. The current figures bear that out. Yet both Goldsmith and Khan are very mindful that Corbyn could still be a liability for the Labour man. \n~~~ COMMENT: So, the \"analysis\" seems to indicate that the only way for Goldsmith to win is if something can have an effect on Khan's campaign. Notably, Corbyn. That seems weak to me. Sure, Corbyn is a bit of a loose cannon, but I doubt that he says/does something in the next few months -- especially with the impending Brexit referendum -- that sways the support away from Khan that much.

However, the two previous mayors (Ken Livingstone, Independent and then Labour; and Boris Johnson, Tory) have flourished by being - either actually, in Ken's first term, or perceived as independent or quasi-independent of their party machines.  Both were \"larger than life\" characters, too.  None of which really applies to Goldsmith or Khan (will whoever wins become the first London Mayor to be more commonly referred to by their surname than their forename, too...)  Khan is kind of on the left of the Labour party - which in London largely counts in his favour (the suburbs that are also included in the mayoralty? a bit less so),  - he was selected as mayoral candidate in the same poll and by the same voters that made Corbyn party leader; and Labour party membership has expanded particularly rapidly in London in response to Corbyn. Not that that necessarily has any resonance with the wider electorate (and in fact may repulse at least as many as it attracts)... Goldsmith appeals on the environmental front (although would he take second preference votes from Greens? As a conservative, highly unlikely). Tory party is much less active on the ground in London, its membership seems to be smaller. Boris won by reaching out well beyond traditional Tory voters to those who were fed with Ken's far-left posturing and other of his policies. Not yet convinced (despite having placed a bet on him so doing months ago....) than Goldsmith can do the same.

It's more or less the only place in the country that, in aggregate, probably doesn't mind Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader (elsewhere he is very widely regarded as a naive idiot). Khan is a solid candidate with no obvious blots on his record, and provided he doesn't screw up, he should win. Yes, Tory Boris Johnson won the last two mayoral elections, but Boris is an exceptional politician with a gift for being liked that manages to cross political divides. Zac is a good retail politician, as well as being smart & likeable (he took a marginal seat in Richmond and over 2 elections has turned it solidly Tory), but Boris he is not.  Current polls indicate a decent lead for Khan (http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/jan/10/london-mayor-race-can-zac-goldsmith-catch-sadiq-khan). Things could change, but I'll be somewhat surprised if they do. Factor in also that if the Brexit referendum happens in 2016, as I think it will, and a lot of Tory party energy will be directed at the referendum, not at a mayoral election that doesn't matter THAT much and which the Tories may rightly figure they aren't very likely to win away."]]}
