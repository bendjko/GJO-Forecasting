However 28% say the security situation has remained the same, while 21% say it has worsened. Further analysis reveals that politically motivated conflicts (28%), land ownership disputes (24%), religious conflicts (23%) and farmer & pastoralist conflicts (22%) are amongst common causes of conflicts across Nigerian communities. (http://allafrica.com/stories/201705290074.html)  The Nigerian government appears to be making progress in regards to armed conflict solutions: \nTijjani Bande, the Representative of Nigeria to the UN, \u201cnoted Resolution 2286 of former Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon, which recommended the swift implementation of this resolution, which platforms to enhance respect for the norms of international humanitarian law.\u201d\n\u201cIn fulfilment of its obligation, the Nigerian government has set up a presidential committee on North East Initiative to serve as the primary national body. Among others, to enhance the security conditions in the Northeast of the country, facilitate the work of health personnel and ease the movement of medical equipment and supplies.\u201d \n(https://www.businessdayonline.com/nigeria-reaffirms-commitment-protect-civilians-armed-conflicts/)  Despite the growing Biafran movement, it seems unlikely that 1000 civilians will die through this conflict (more than 150 pro-biafrans were killed from August 2015-August 2016) . The acting President Yemi Osinbajo said, during a Biafra Civil forum in Abuja: \u201cThey say that secession is the answer to the charges of marginalisation. Brothers and sisters, permit me to differ and to suggest that we\u2019re greater together than apart\u201d (http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/05/50-years-nigeria-biafra-secessionist-movement-170529151102396.html). This appears to show an attempt to work with the pro-Biafra movement\u2026 In regards to Boko Haram, a report on the Nigeria Today website stated: \u201cBoko Haram\u2019s leader, Abubakar Shekau continues to issue fresh threats of overrunning more Nigerian territories to establish his desired Islamic caliphate\u201d. (http://www.nigeriatoday.ng/2017/06/security-a-conflicting-story-of-sadness-and-joy/). However, with Cameroon, Nigeria, Niger and Chad actively fighting against Boko Haram, with the assistance of US special forces (https://www.armytimes.com/articles/soldiers-deploy-to-central-africa-to-support-the-fight-against-boko-haram), it is unlikely, though not impossible, that Boko Haram will be able to build back up to the level of destruction they were causing in 2014.  On the Herdsmen/farmers conflict: \n\u201cThe senate on the 24th May 2017, ordered the Inspector General of Police to urgently take steps to arrest killer herdsmen and all armed killers masquerading as herdsmen in communities, forests and farms throughout the country\u201d (http://www.nigeriatoday.ng/2017/06/security-a-conflicting-story-of-sadness-and-joy/) \nThe USAID convoy participated in a close door meeting to \u201cdiscuss the herdsmen/famers clashes in recent times and proffer lasting solutions to the incessant conflicts\u201d (http://www.nigeriatoday.ng/2017/06/usaid-wades-into-fulani-herdsmenfarmer-conflicts-in-nigeria/) \nWith action being taken in this area as well, unless something drastic happens, this should also limit civilian casualties.

I predict no armed group will systematically kill 1,000 or more people in Nigeria between April 1, 2017 - March 31, 2018.  Boko Haram seems to be following the ISIS abroad tactic of small scale terrorist attacks as their main means of combat.  The major risk area I see is the borderlands and the presence of Boko Haram in other countries leaking into less secure regions of Nigeria.

The functions of the commission shall be to engage in conflict monitoring and mitigation activities, including organising regular joint interactive meetings in communities, designing and implementing peace advocacy programmes in the mass media, as well as carrying out peace advocacy work in schools, public places and worship centres\u201d (http://allafrica.com/stories/201704270276.html) \nThis will involve the Nigerian government working with international organisations and agencies involved in peace mediation in order to help the commission carry out its work. Of course, this only matters when the Commission put words into action.  In relation to conflict between herdsmen and farmers; \u201cthe federal government has proposed a national conference to address the protractive and bloodletting conflicts between herdsmen and farmers.\u201d The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development (Chief Audu Ogbeh) has said the national conference will bring together major stakeholders to analyse the crises, which would be held in the second week of June. (https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2017/04/25/fg-to-hold-national-conference-on-herdsmen-farmers-conflict-in-june/)  I\u2019ve been reading into the conflict in Biafra (Niger River Delta region) and found this report to be very insightful; it provides analysis of all the areas of major conflict in Nigeria: http://www.globalresearch.ca/hybrid-war-can-wreak-havoc-across-west-africa-2/5584061\nThe general gist of the article is what the impact of having three main ethno-regional identities has on the country. \u201cThe general idea is that the reconsolidating of ethno-regional identities around the Hausa-Fulani, Yoruba and Igbo peoples could set into motion the uncontrollable centrifugal process of Identity Federalism or separatism.\u201d  What can be seen happening in the Biafra region is there are 3 main groups; \u201cNiger Delta Avengers\u201d, \u201cMovement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB)\u201d and \u201cMovement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND)\u201d, who are divided due to their competing interests.\n\u2018Operation Crocodile Smile\u2019 was launched by the government in August 2016 to \u201cbring back law and order to the southeast\u201d. In response to this, the Niger Delta Avengers launched \u201cOperation Crocodile Tears\u201d to fight back against the government. \nIn relation to Hybrid War \u201cthere appears to be an ethnic divided between the Avengers and the other Biafra militant with attempts having been made to link the Ijaw (indigenous people to the Niger Delta region) with the Avengers. Whether or not the Ijaws are the main driving force behind the avengers, this is how they are being portrayed which can indicate two pertinent things. Firstly, Operation Crocodile Smile could be interpreted as targeting the Ijaw, thus raising expected claims of \u2018ethnic cleansing\u2019 and \u2018genocide\u2019 if the conflict heats up. Secondly, because of what appears to be a divide between the Ijaw, Igbos and and Itsekiri, there\u2019s a chance for the government to exacerbate whatever splits are currently existing in order to isolate active militants by turning their neighbours against them\u201d.  Unless the Ijaw publicly claim to back the Avengers, I cannot see this transpiring into a genocide due to the international condemnation that would follow. Nigeria cannot afford to lose international funding, especially with the \u201cat risk of famine\u201d conditions currently occurring in the northeast.

Disputes behind the violence allegedly focus on the use of resources such as farmlands, grazing areas, and water, with both sides claiming grievances against the other.\u201d (ACLED report)  Boko Haram were the second most deadliest armed group to Nigerian civilians in 2016. \u201cresponsible for 790 reported civilian fatalities in 2016\u201d (ACLED report). Given the amount of territory that the group lost last year, it is unlikely that they will be able to top the 2016 figure past 1000 casualties - unless they have a repeat of the massacre in Baga (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/09/nigeria-baga-massacre-boko-haram-1-year-on) \nTrump is upping military presence in many countries across the world, including some African countries e.g. Somalia. \u201cThe Pentagon has allocated about $250 million over two years to help train the armies and security forces of North, Central and West African countires\u201d (https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/19/world/africa/trump-special-forces-navy-seals.html). With the help of US special forces in Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria, Boko Haram will be limited to expanding territory. It is my understanding that Boko Haram are engaged in a campaign that systematically kills civilians as the Barnawi faction of the terror group have stated \u201cit is moving away from attacks that target muslim civilians\u201d (ACLED report) \u201cFamine Early War System Network (FEWS NET) predicts a credible risk of severe food insecurities in Nigeria\u2026This could lead to greater instability across central and northern areas of Nigeria, which in turn puts pressure on Nigerian security services and offers new opportunities for Boko Haram to press over-extended forces\u201d (ACLED report). FEWS NET is an agency supported by USAID - which is at risk of a 28% budget cut in Trumps new budget proposal; \u201cReduces funding to UN and affiliated agencies, including peacekeeping\u201d. Preventing a famine in Nigeria depends largely on countering terrorism - if the USAs funding to the UN decreases by the end of 2017, the UN will have to decide which of the countries with conflict are most likely to receive peacekeeping missions. \nHowever, the new US administrations budget also states: \u201cAllows for significant funding of humanitarian assistance, including food aid, disaster and refugee program funding. This would focus funding on the highest priority areas\u2026\u201d(https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/budget/fy2018/2018_blueprint.pdf page 33). Given the UN\u2019s estimate of 4 famines in 2017, UN Humanitarian Chief O\u2019brien said \u201cWe stand at a crucial point in history. Already at the beginning of the year we are facing the largest humanitarian crisis since the creation of the UN\u201d (http://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/11/africa/un-famine-starvation-aid/) it is possible with a famine only affecting 120000, compared to millions in other countries, they will get the least support in terms of food aid.
