However, Trump is reported to make a decision on this in January, and disputes would not be filled preemptively. If he makes a go decision for the tariff in December, which could reasonably have a 5-10% chance, then Korea would need to have the dispute ready to file intermediately, which I think reduces the chance further, hence 4%. The base rate would be low given that Korea has filled 11 disputes against the US since 1998, 8 of which were about anti-dumping measures and 2 were definitive safeguard measures.\n"], [32100, "2017-12-12T15:04:11Z", [0.0], ""], [41649, "2017-12-12T10:12:53Z", [0.5], ""], [368, "2017-12-12T00:00:11Z", [0.0], ""], [41270, "2017-12-11T22:15:48Z", [0.05], ""], [42318, "2017-12-11T19:13:07Z", [0.02], ""], [40960, "2017-12-11T13:10:09Z", [0.05], ""], [3317, "2017-12-11T12:21:43Z", [0.03], ""], [42258, "2017-12-11T06:10:52Z", [0.05], ""], [42170, "2017-12-11T01:01:35Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-12-10T19:19:43Z", [0.0], ""], [1667, "2017-12-10T15:26:56Z", [0.01], ""], [691, "2017-12-10T14:07:38Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-12-10T00:40:12Z", [0.0], ""], [37594, "2017-12-09T22:30:27Z", [0.15], "Maybe wait until after the Olympics."], [19326, "2017-12-09T21:12:40Z", [0.03], ""], [42239, "2017-12-09T17:13:19Z", [0.05], ""], [8318, "2017-12-09T02:42:41Z", [0.37], ""], [368, "2017-12-08T20:57:15Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-12-08T20:37:17Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-12-08T20:32:08Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-12-08T05:29:54Z", [0.0], ""], [38101, "2017-12-08T03:09:40Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-12-07T15:58:13Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-12-06T20:07:23Z", [0.0], ""], [42032, "2017-12-06T19:45:04Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-12-05T18:27:28Z", [0.0], ""], [36923, "2017-12-05T17:39:13Z", [0.0], ""], [42150, "2017-12-05T11:44:54Z", [0.0], ""], [13959, "2017-12-05T01:51:14Z", [0.0], ""], [16272, "2017-12-04T18:26:47Z", [0.02], ""], [368, "2017-12-04T17:56:25Z", [0.0], ""], [41788, "2017-12-04T16:20:04Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-12-04T13:45:27Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-12-04T00:47:33Z", [0.0], ""], [39561, "2017-12-03T23:21:15Z", [0.0], ""], [22132, "2017-12-03T22:05:52Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-12-03T20:25:04Z", [0.0], ""], [37488, "2017-12-02T23:20:20Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-12-02T18:40:00Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-12-02T18:34:50Z", [0.0], ""], [10945, "2017-12-02T13:20:19Z", [0.06], "south koreans might abstain from annyoing their main partner on the issue of north korea, especially under current circumstances"], [41725, "2017-12-02T09:50:39Z", [0.6], ""], [20929, "2017-12-02T07:09:50Z", [0.01], ""], [41523, "2017-12-02T05:32:37Z", [0.01], ""], [32258, "2017-12-02T02:36:13Z", [0.0], "Great points @Raisinville"], [83, "2017-12-02T02:13:45Z", [0.0], "Too much thinking here.
