However, I think the fund split also needs to be taken into account. Typically, a higher proportion of funds outperform the index when small caps outperform large caps (although I have not actually confirmed this is the case). This seems reasonable as the Composite S&P1500 is dominated by the large-cap S&P500. The S&P1500 has returned +13.8% since 30 June 2016, while the S&P500 is +13.5%,  the Mid Cap S&P400 is +15.5% and Small Cap S&P600 is +19.2%. Therefore, assuming no change before mid-year, a higher proportion of the Large cap funds should underperform, while more mid-cap funds should outperform and most of the small cap funds should outperform. SPIVA gives the fund split of fund in the mid-year report which I assume hasn't changed: 24% of funds are multi-cap, 38% large-cap, 14% mid-cap and 24% small-cap. I assume the S&P1500 outperforms 60% of multi-cap, 70% of large-cap, 40% of mid-cap and 20% of small-cap (these figures are arbitrary guesstimates). Overall, therefore, the index should outperform roughly 51% of the funds (24%*60%+38%*70%+14%*40%+24%*20%). The 8% for 70-90% is also a guesstimate. A more accurate method would probably be to regress the performance of the constituent indices against the overall figure. Alternatively, it may be possible to get data on all the funds and sort their relative performance as of today, although I couldn't find a website which allows you to set a specific starting date (I think Morningstar enables ranking over -1 year)."], [30400, "2017-03-17T08:44:54Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.65, 0.3], ""], [20284, "2017-03-16T23:56:34Z", [0.8, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [34043, "2017-03-16T23:54:16Z", [0.0, 0.75, 0.24, 0.01], ""], [14253, "2017-03-16T19:20:32Z", [0.05, 0.31, 0.59, 0.05], ""], [4634, "2017-03-16T18:45:39Z", [0.02, 0.18, 0.65, 0.15], ""], [706, "2017-03-16T18:29:25Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.85, 0.15], "This is no longer in doubt: index trackers win."], [29054, "2017-03-16T14:40:43Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.48, 0.52], "It does seem to be a narrowing range of outperformance by the index based on cost of money, as index  represents a strong part of the economy that benefits from cheap money, I am betting in the incompetence of allocators and funds managers reliance in quant data to outperform the index.

The sample sizes are very small of course and one needs to be careful not to draw too many conclusions. Interestingly, I see two phenomena:\n1) There seems to be a trend toward a higher share of underperforming funds over time. This trend even holds up when only looking at the last 8 years for which we have comparable mid-year and full-year data. I assume that there may be either a market/technology development or higher transparency behind it, but am not sure.\n2) The mid-year numbers vary quite strongly from the full-year numbers, with higher 50-70% at mid-year which migrates to 70-90% at year-end. Again, this may be linked to transparency? As a result, I think that one should:\n- use the average over the last 8 years (rather than the last 15 years)\n- one should rather use the mid-year numbers than the year-end numbers\n- one should factor in 2-3% increase of the average per year\nBut again, all of the above relying on a small sample size, one should not put too much faith in its statistical analysis in my view. Also interestingly, the mean & median over 15 years are approx. 60%, not 75% as indicated by the SPIVA in the article I mentioned in an earlier post. But the median comes close to 75% once one corrects for the trend.
