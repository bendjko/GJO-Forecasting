As detailed data, listing the perpatrator, is only avaiable for <January 2017 yet, it is hard to draw definitive conclusions. Im January 2017, the Islamic State was directly responsibile for half of all killed civilians. While civilians also die as 'collateral damage' in fighting, overall it's clear that the Islamic State is perpetrating mass atrocity crimes targeting the civilian population and Shiites in particular. Only 34 deaths have been recorded for October so far, but as far as I can tell there is no reason to expect that deaths won't be around 500 again this month. Each month, only 84 deaths would have to be attributed as deliberate killings to the Islamic State to resolve this question. This is rather likely in my view.
