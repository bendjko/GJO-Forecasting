From the AMTI map you can see where China claims the boundary of its EEZ to be; given that it overlaps into Vietnams it still seems possible they will move their oil rig into what Vietnam claims as it\u2019s EEZ. Considering the already heightened tensions in the South China Sea due to North Korea, it seems unlikely China would want to raise tensions with Vietnam too.\nhttps://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/home/shipid:565777/zoom:14\nhttps://amti.csis.org/maritime-claims-map/"], [691, "2017-09-04T12:09:48Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [691, "2017-09-03T17:13:21Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [30364, "2017-09-03T15:29:55Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [1034, "2017-09-03T06:54:43Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [12591, "2017-09-03T04:43:44Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.9], ""], [30364, "2017-09-02T14:33:10Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [691, "2017-09-02T13:49:17Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [1034, "2017-09-02T07:17:35Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [28414, "2017-09-01T16:24:10Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [15621, "2017-09-01T16:23:16Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.03, 0.97], "China seems to be following diplomatic route at present."], [691, "2017-09-01T13:52:09Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [1034, "2017-09-01T05:21:54Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [691, "2017-08-31T16:35:05Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [1034, "2017-08-31T10:16:58Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [30364, "2017-08-30T19:39:40Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [691, "2017-08-30T17:31:33Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [1034, "2017-08-30T05:56:57Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [691, "2017-08-29T19:59:41Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [1993, "2017-08-29T19:28:44Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [691, "2017-08-28T20:30:29Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [29591, "2017-08-28T16:58:21Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.09, 0.91], ""], [34725, "2017-08-28T13:50:19Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [1034, "2017-08-28T05:14:17Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [30364, "2017-08-27T22:25:38Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [691, "2017-08-27T12:17:05Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [691, "2017-08-26T11:49:23Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [24771, "2017-08-26T05:48:55Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.92], ""], [691, "2017-08-25T20:15:52Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [1034, "2017-08-25T06:32:24Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [691, "2017-08-24T16:09:54Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [30364, "2017-08-24T13:18:58Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [1034, "2017-08-24T06:14:38Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [691, "2017-08-23T19:48:43Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [15621, "2017-08-23T14:28:16Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.07, 0.93], "Passage of time"], [1034, "2017-08-23T05:59:43Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [38421, "2017-08-23T04:22:38Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.9], ""], [37474, "2017-08-23T02:37:17Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.8], ""], [38505, "2017-08-23T00:25:52Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [691, "2017-08-22T22:38:07Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [30364, "2017-08-22T01:30:47Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.9], ""], [691, "2017-08-21T17:00:12Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [12879, "2017-08-21T16:30:45Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.8], ""], [1333, "2017-08-21T15:33:01Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.8], ""], [29591, "2017-08-20T15:22:41Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.09, 0.91], "The HYSY 981 appears to be stalking the Vietnamese EEZ boundary. \n(https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:565777/mmsi:413464330/imo:9480344/vessel:HAI_YANG_SHI_YOU_981) \nWill increase probability for July - December if the rig moves west.

The South China Sea has long been the most, thorny issue for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), with different opinions among its 10 members on how to address China's assertiveness and its building and heavy arming of its artificial islands in disputed waters. Philippine foreign ministry spokesman Robespierre Bolivar gave no reason for the delay and said the statement would instead be released at the end of a series of regional events hosted by Manila in the next few days. \"The communique will be issued together with all the chairman's statements by the end of all the meetings,\" he said. ASEAN's problem in agreeing the wording highlight China's growing influence at a time of uncertainty whether the new U.S. administration will priorities relations with ASEAN, and try to check Beijing's controversial maritime activities. Diplomats from three ASEAN countries said the delay was because Vietnam, which is among four members with competing sovereignty claims with China, wanted the text to mention the need to avoid land reclamation and militarization (para. 1-6). China is extremely sensitive about ASEAN mentioning its expansion of its military capabilities on those islands and some members are concerned about possible repercussions of upsetting Beijing given its military and economic power (para.8). Three of China's seven reclaimed reefs have runways several kilometers\u2019 long, radar, surface-to-air missiles and storage facilities for fighter jets. \"It's only Vietnam holding out. Maybe, by tomorrow everything will be ironed out,\" said one diplomat involved in the drafting process (para. 8-10). Mogato, M. (2017).

Of course, there is some validity of these views in recent history. And there is another (minority) point of view. Times are changing. China cannot behave as bully anymore as other countries can gang up together and call on the US (even with Trump in power). China wants to be respected rather than feared (in contrast for example to Russia). It is the biggest economy in the world (by PPP). Its influence does not match its economy yet. So China is reverting to its traditional approach of moving slowly, building its soft power and solving its disputes one by one with neighbors through bilateral, rather than multilateral agreements. If you talk to Chinese, they would say such approach is in their culture. So far it works - Philippines and Malaysia are moving toward China. Why risk it with deep  sea oil rigs in others' EEZ? The oil is cheap now. The sea lanes are open. China is building alternatives, with its Silk Road. And Saudis are happy to send their Oil to the Chinese...
