Liberal Moon Jae-in is the clear front-runner with centrist Ahn Cheol-soo his nearest challenger. The election is being closely watched at a time of economic uncertainty and heightened tensions with North Korea. Mr Moon wants to increase contact with the North in contrast to ex-leader Park Geun-hye who cut almost all ties. Observers are expecting a high turnout at the ballot boxes, with numbers boosted by younger voters, as South Koreans choose from 13 candidates. Polls close at 20:00 local time (11:00 GMT), with the winner expected to be announced soon after (para. 1-6). BBC News Website. (2017). South Korea election: Polls open to choose new president. BBC.
