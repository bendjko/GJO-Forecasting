I don't see any trend through April as Trump's approval and disapproval ratings hover at just over 40 and 53 respectively. \nOne standard deviation to the left of the mean puts the net approval number near -18 while +2 standard deviations from the mean puts the net approval rating at less than +12, this effectively eliminates Above +15 as a viable ending net approval number.\nRegarding the flip from the prior forecasts from a 16% chance above +15 to a 15% chance below -15 was due to reversing the three-day rolling average daily numbers from the Gallup daily tracking chart into their spreadsheet columns, approval numbers were transcribed to the disapproval column - rookie mistake!!...."], [1738, "2017-04-24T18:34:43Z", [0.3, 0.7, 0.0], ""], [23879, "2017-04-24T17:21:33Z", [0.45, 0.55, 0.0], "Updating from 40/60/0.

Seems like the House is poised to try something in the healthcare domain again next week [1]. I honestly don't know how people will respond. My simple mental model of the situation is: for almost any proposal Republicans put forward, left-leaning media will report it as bad, and conservative media will report it as good. But then what swung the approval ratings so low last time? In the simple model, liberals already thought Trump was bad, and conservatives already thought he was good (roughly speaking). So the simple model is failing to account for some big effect. Independents? My experience with humans makes me doubt quite strongly that any significant number of them is actually reading the proposed bills and thinking through the consequences. Even if it's just one week to go, media is already reporting that a new healthcare-related effort is happening in the House. If it's a replay of the first time around, approval that week will almost certainly be below -15. But maybe they learned their lesson and will do it differently this time?

Partisans on both sides are fairly predictable, and the only way you get a +15 is if an outside force scrambles the calculus of \"the resistance.\" (akin to the national response to 9/11 sending GWB's approval sky-high) So that one is as likely as a world-changing event, which I'm pegging at 5%.  2. This means that 95% of the time, the less ideological bloc will determine which way net approval goes.  I think this bloc primarily responds to the \"mood music\" of the Trump admin media coverage.  I define the mood music as 1. what mainstream news covers, 1a. how they choose to frame it, 2. conservative media's counter-framing effort to bend the narrative for their own ends. (Note: I'm not saying msm is liberal. There is no left equivalent to conservative political/media/lobbying network) 3. My guess on the mood music is that Trump is due for a minor net corrective uptick over the next few weeks because \n- the story on Russia, wiretapping, and congress is getting complicated\n- the logical \"plot twist\" would be in the direction of a surprising shift, like \"Trump is learning how to be President,\" similar to what happened in the immediate wake of speech to congress in late Feb. I have no idea what the hook for this slow turn could be (a hook may not even be needed), but my sense is the mainstream's vigor re incremental updates to the Russia story will wane a bit.  The short-term counterframe of  \"see this was all overblown from the start,\" would gain some attention by filling the vacuum, and the overall mood music would get a little less dire for Trump. Since he's at -18 as of this writing, I would say shifting back into the -15 to +15 range is worth 60% of my remaining 95%. 4. I do think there's a chance for events to intervene and advance the plot in the other direction - something like a senior staff resignation, another weird tweeting jag, or a real revelation by the FBI would probably do it. This would satisfy the media's collective desire for a \"plot twist,\" no matter that it wouldn't be in the \"Trump is getting better/settling down\" direction. The counter-frame would continue to strain for credibility since real-world events have to at least be acknowledged, and there's no persuasive way for the fox/breitbart apparatus to address events like these in a way that will move the needle .

While popular vote is not necessarily the same as net approval rating, I\u2019ll note that Trump\u2019s -8% (46% - 54%) popular vote margin mimics his recent negative net approval ratings after discounting for the election and inaugural bumps.  So, I am going to say they are similar enough.   Aspects of the keys relevant to the timeframe of this question are short-term economy, social unrest, scandal, foreign/military failures and successes, party performance and policy change.  Relative to these keys, what will be different between now and April 28th that will alter Trump\u2019s current -6% net approval rating?   Some keys will stay the same.  The positive direction of the economy and the current level of social unease are likely to continue.  Given the ethical conflicts within the Trump Administration, issues related to Russia, and the nature of the President himself, continuing hints of scandal are inevitable, but the bar here is high.  A true scandal, if there ever is one, will likely take longer than April 28th to manifest itself in the public\u2019s mind.   The prospects for foreign/military failures and successes within the next 51 days are probably balanced. Two keys will probably improve as the new Congress gets rolling and looks ahead to the midterms.  Republicans are likely to take legislative actions that will implement policy changes, and regardless of an individual\u2019s politics, getting something done in Washington DC will cast a positive light on Trump. On balance then, Trump\u2019s net approval rating is likely to improve from here.  However, looking at Gallup\u2019s historical Presidential Job Approval data, approval ratings do not improve very fast without a cataclysmic event ( e.g., 911).

Considering the aforementioned the benefactors of fake news are the traditional news outlets of the baby boomers.   \"President Donald Trump: The First 100 Days\"\nhttp://www.theonion.com/live/president-donald-trump-first-100-days-55086/entry/136 \"Kim Jong-Un Named The Onion's Sexiest Man Alive For 2012\"\nhttp://www.theonion.com/article/kim-jong-un-named-the-onions-sexiest-man-alive-for-30379 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Onion"], [33516, "2017-02-19T19:29:02Z", [0.37, 0.6, 0.03], ""], [19253, "2017-02-19T19:23:10Z", [0.45, 0.55, 0.0], ""], [28000, "2017-02-19T19:05:30Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [14208, "2017-02-19T18:42:38Z", [0.12, 0.85, 0.03], ""], [33875, "2017-02-19T18:33:26Z", [0.35, 0.65, 0.0], ""], [33876, "2017-02-19T18:32:45Z", [0.4, 0.55, 0.05], ""], [904, "2017-02-19T18:16:13Z", [0.85, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [28414, "2017-02-19T17:37:28Z", [0.52, 0.47, 0.01], ""], [12771, "2017-02-19T17:06:36Z", [0.1, 0.3, 0.6], "Events will normalize.

Is his current approval rating an outlier that will trend back towards his \"mean\" as the population becomes desensitized / stops paying attention? - Is Trump capable of moderating his behavior in such a way as to turn public perception? It seems unlikely - the pundits have been predicting his upcoming pivot to the center for almost a year at this point. That being said, he IS a master marketer, so perhaps he will find a way to sell himself better to the American public. - What is the likelihood of a major national emergency that might unite the public behind him? Without going back and actually checking the history books, the odds of this seem low. I'd say an event like this typically occurs once a presidency, if at all.

Unlike many expected, he has made very little effort to move to the center and unify the country, instead working through (or at least giving the impression of working through) many of the campaign promises the electorate considered to be most hyperbolic and unrealistic.  Barring a dramatic change in his governance style or some sort of national crisis (war, major terrorist attack, etc.), I expect Trump's numbers to continue to decline slightly. For me, the real question is the level and commitment of Trump's support. How many people held their noses and voted for him because of their dislike of the alternative?

First, it explains the discrepancy between his favorability polls with his initial job approval numbers. There are 12 million people who have an unfavorable view of Trump but nonetheless voted for him. These people are in a state of cognitive dissonance, thinking that if they voted for Trump he can\u2019t be that bad a president.  Second, his initial job approval numbers are soft, and they can regress to his prior unfavorable numbers.  Clearly, this can already be seen in the results of the past few days.

Trump's approval rating is evolving in a historically unprecedented way. No president has had a net approval of -9 after a week. I see two possibilities from here:  - once his cabinet members are in office (in particular Tillerson and Ross), they will exercise some moderating effect on the White House. So policy making will become more deliberate, with an effort to minimize the negative side effects. This should lead to some stabilization of Trump's net approval rating in the (-15, 0) range (support 40-45, disapproval 45-55);  - the White House remains bent on delivering Trump's promises, all critics be damned. This would lead to independents taking a definite anti-Trump view, and support dropping to the core (which I still estimate at about 40% for the first 100 days). Then Trump's net approval rating will stay in the (-20, -10) range. I place a higher probability on the first scenario (60-40), since in the second one Trump would likely lose his ability to govern, with some clear opposition from the Republicans in the Senate.

People only started feeling the consequences of Obamacare 1+ years after it was enacted.

First, it is important to note the popular vote as a way to gauge where Trump started off in terms of popularity.  It can be assumed that on election day, roughly all 62 million Trump voters would have said they approve of him as a president.  So, this would put Trump at a 48.8% approval rating.  Between now and then, his rating has sunk down to 45%.  Of the remaining population, 45% disapprove and 10% are undecided.  Based off of his antics, stances on divisive issues and overall presence, it is unlikely Trump will convince those who already dislike him, to begin to approve of him as a president.  However, it is not entirely impossible, which is why there is a 5% chance that Trump will have a +15 net approval.  Of those who are undecided, there are a few possibilities.  I expect there to be three potential splits - 7% approve and 3% disapprove, 5% approve and 5% disapprove, 3% approve and 7% disapprove.  My best guess is that the last option is most likely.  The nation mostly belongs to the Democratic party, and Trump doesn't do himself any favors by staying out of the spotlight.  So, with the undecided population now decided, the split comes out to a 52% disapprove, 48% approve.  This is a net of -4%.  This gap could further widen to a 57% disapprove and 43% approve split with a margin of -14%.  In other words, Trump would need to lose the support of 3,148,994 people which is roughly the population of Iowa.  This is not people that already dislike him - Trump would need to under perform so badly that 3 million of his own supporters would feel the need to reject him.  That is a substantial amount, and not one to be taken lightly.  However, the political landscape is becoming a minefield.  Trump is going to oversee the repealing of Obamacare and sign its replacement into law.  In order to live up to campaign promises, it will have to be nothing short of stellar.  Speaking of campaign promises, that list has yet to be touched, which could make his voting base start to feel resentful.  These factors could play into a substantial loss of support for Trump.  As such, this is why I have put the final split of odds for Trump at a 25% chance he has a net approval of -15, 70% that he has a net of -15 to +15 (inclusive), and 5% that he has a net of +15."], [29469, "2017-01-25T20:35:37Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [32003, "2017-01-25T20:01:39Z", [0.25, 0.5, 0.25], ""], [651, "2017-01-25T19:43:55Z", [0.25, 0.6, 0.15], ""], [27461, "2017-01-25T19:27:57Z", [0.15, 0.85, 0.0], "Update of arithmetics:\n - approval range: 40-50 percent (from 35-50).

I have heard, and confirmed by checking the Obama, Bush Jr & Clinton numbers [2,3], and it makes some kind of sense to me, that most president's approval ratings fall right after they take office. During the campaign people idolize candidates, and then reality settles in and everyone is inevitably disappointed. On the other hand, I'm not sure if what's happening is better described as \"approval ratings DECREASE\" or \"approval ratings REGRESS TO THE MEAN\". If the latter, one would expect to see Trump's net approval ratings go back towards zero. Trump was vilified throughout his campaign, so it is possible that once boring reality sets in, people are less inflamed and move from \"disapprove\" to \"no opinion\" (so in answer to the survey question --- which does not offer a neutral option --- they would be equally likely to say either). So I will make a judgement call here, since apparently we have NEVER had a president start off with NEGATIVE approval ratings. Indeed roughly speaking they all start with 60s-70s approval ratings [3], with the very strange outlier of Eisenhower, which is so strange that I suspect an error in data collection or data entry. (His approval rating shoots up from 30% to 70% in one month?) As the unprecedented Women's March and general media treatment illustrate, I believe the people who disapprove of Trump will not stop disapproving of him. It seems to be a strong identity issue, moreso than usual. Moreover his cabinet picks don't seem even slightly conciliatory. If that's right, it mathematically caps his net approval at 45 - 55 = -10. For it to go above 15 he would need at least 57.5% approval, i.e. for 23% of the people who currently disapprove of him to switch to approving, in about 3 months. It simply won't happen. On the other hand, of the 42% who currently approve of Trump, if just 10% switch from \"approve\" to \"no opinion\", (and assuming no-opinioners answer approve/disapprove randomly) that would bring the net approval to below -15. Of course it's unrealistic to assume that NOBODY who currently disapproves of Trump will stop doing so. So let me approach the question in a more nuanced manner. Suppose x% of Trump-unfavorable people become Trump-favorable, and y% of Trump-fav become Trump-unfav, between now and 28 April 2017. What relationship between x and y would make Trump net approval dip below -15? Working out the arithmetic we find y > 1.31x + 2.38 In other words, if 5% of Trump-unfav become Trump-fav, we'd still get net approval below -15 if ~9% of Trump-fav became Trump-unfav. I'm not sure how likely this is for various values of x, nor what the most likely values of x are. It is some question of elasticity if you will; are Trump-favs more than ~1.5 times as likely to flip as Trump-unfavs? Put that way it seems very likely to me. The narrative is that Trump won as an outsider because people hated insiders, and now he will become more like an insider. On the other hand, approval ratings jump around quite a bit in response to big actions of the president, and 28 April may happen to fall in the aftermath of some big Trump decision, like banning immigration as per another question. For now I will say 75% chance of below -15, but this is a question where frequent updating will be key.
