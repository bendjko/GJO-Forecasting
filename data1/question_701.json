I expect that the credit rating people and the UK authorities will be aware that the figures may not be reflecting what similar figures would normally signal. For example I am hearing that businesses are finding sales are weak, but at the same time are raising output sharply. I only have access to information supplied by friends (so not reported in the media, not from surveys). I am not saying that the businesses with weakening sales are necessarily the same businesses that are increasing production. The increased production is taking place to build up stocks in case of a hard Brexit. I have heard  2 months extra stock as being a target (to be held in the UK or in the rest of the EU depending on the nature of the products).  The exact reason for the falling sales is less clear, but uncertainty is the likely reason. \nThe consequences are that UK GDP could appear to be higher in the short term, but because this if the concerns about disrupted trade are resolved, presumably stocks could be reduced again which would depress GDP in the medium term. If the need to hold more stocks becomes permanent that will require firms to use more capital (equity or borrowing) which has a cost and prices will reflect that. \nIt can be noted that a lower value for the pound has not proved to be a great boost to exports. That is not really surprising because in order to boost exports investment is likely to be needed (some production for domestic consumption could be switched to export, but increased exporting is likely to involve investing in marketing, distributions, variations in design as well as requiting and training labour, installing or upgrading plant and machinery etc.) In a period of great uncertainty many businesses will hold back investments or direct investment money into countries less likely to suffer from the uncertainty.  \nSo I expect contradictory signals on the state of the UK economy between now and 30 Sept.

As of S&P's last assessment (\"maintain\") in Oct 2017, they hadn't even started the 2nd phase of negotiations, and this was viewed as a major risk. Fortunately, in mid-Dec 2017, they did start the 2nd phase, which is ongoing. From my cursory reading of the news, they need to settle: (i) usual trade issues, there will be posturing, but ultimately it's in everyone's best interest to reach a deal, so I think they will reach one, even if after a transitional period;\n(ii) some freedom of movement issues, e.g. what happens to EU nationals currently living in UK, and vice-versa --- these don't strike me as hard to find agreement on;\n(iii) the issue with the Irish border, which is mathematically impossible to solve. However, it is small and localized enough that they may simply pretend like they solved it, without actually solving it, in the interests of getting a deal and stability. UK exit from EU happens in mid-March 2019. The question deadline, ~6 months before that, strikes me as a bit early to have S&P form a judgment on how Brexit will turn out. Especially if there's a transitional period --- which, as far as I can tell, is against nobody's interests, so is quite likely to be implemented. The indicators that S&P said [1] they would look out for in possible future downgrades seem like big things to me, that would take a long time to materialize or detect trends in: changes in GDP per capita, amount of GBP held as reserve currency by central banks around the world, capital inflows/outflows... without these concrete numbers, which I don't think we'll have by Sep 2018, they have to go off of the progression of negotations, which as I argued will probably not look awful by Sep. Based on all this I wanted to say 90% \"no adjustment\", 10% \"down\". But crowd is much less certain than that, so I take account of its wisdom and say 80/20.

Moody's, one of the major ratings agencies, downgraded the UK to an Aa2 rating from Aa1. It said leaving the European Union was creating economic uncertainty at a time when the UK's debt reduction plans were already off course. Downing Street said the firm's Brexit assessments were \"outdated\". The other major agencies, Fitch and S&P, changed their ratings in 2016, with S&P cutting it two notches from AAA to AA, and Fitch lowering it from AA+ to AA. Moody's said the government had \"yielded to pressure and raised spending in several areas\" including health and social care. It says revenues were unlikely to compensate for the higher spending. Alastair Wilson, head of sovereign ratings at Moody's, gave two reasons for cutting the credit rating, but there was some good news The agency said because the government had not secured a majority in the snap election it \"further obscures the future direction of economic policy\". It also said Brexit would dominate legislative priorities, so there could be limited capacity to address \"substantial\" challenges. It added \"any free trade agreement will likely take years to negotiate, prolonging the current uncertainty for business\". Moody's has also changed the UK's long-term issuer and debt ratings to \"stable\" from \"negative\". Moody's stripped Britain of its top-notch AAA rating in 2013. The government said the latest downgrade followed a meeting on 19 September, and did not consider the prime minister's speech on Friday, in which she outlined her vision for Brexit. \"The prime minister has just set out an ambitious vision for the UK's future relationship with the EU, making clear that both sides will benefit from a new and unique partnership,\" it said. \"The foundations on which we build this partnership are strong.\" It said it had a robust economic record and had made substantial progress in reducing the deficit. \"We are not complacent about the challenges ahead, but we are optimistic about our bright future.\" Consequences for borrowing But Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Peter Dowd, called the downgrade a \"hammer blow\" to the economic credibility of the Conservatives and Chancellor Philip Hammond. He pointed out that it was the second time the credit rating had shifted downwards under their government. Credit rating agencies, in essence, rate a country on the strength of its economy - scoring governments or large companies on how likely they are to pay back their debt. A rating downgrade can affect how much it costs governments to borrow money in the international financial markets. In theory, a high credit rating means a lower interest rate, and vice versa."], [37488, "2018-04-02T03:05:10Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.85], ""], [172, "2018-04-02T02:01:52Z", [0.05, 0.4, 0.55], ""], [41922, "2018-04-01T22:57:17Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [691, "2018-04-01T17:12:59Z", [0.0, 0.22, 0.78], ""], [57456, "2018-04-01T15:59:40Z", [0.45, 0.2, 0.35], ""], [593, "2018-03-31T14:49:07Z", [0.15, 0.15, 0.7], ""], [57302, "2018-03-31T07:10:44Z", [0.15, 0.1, 0.75], ""], [691, "2018-03-30T15:23:07Z", [0.0, 0.42, 0.58], ""], [28563, "2018-03-30T13:29:26Z", [0.02, 0.22, 0.76], ""], [15471, "2018-03-30T08:02:26Z", [0.0, 0.3, 0.7], ""], [46762, "2018-03-30T03:55:57Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "Negotiations are going.. better. \nGDP is growing.

The key tool to ensure U.K.-EU trade is as smooth as possible would be the \u201cmutual recognition\u201d of each other\u2019s regulatory regimes, under the British plan. This idea -- in which each side agrees that the other\u2019s separate system of rules is acceptable -- would also help solve the riddle of the Irish border, according to Brexit Secretary David Davis.\" I believe (but if anyone understands this subject better than I do please correct me) that this is mistaken view. \"EU Mutual Recognition\" has nothing to do with trade deals per se. A number of countries have \"Mutual Recognition\" deals with the EU including the USA, which has no EU Trade Deal. \"EU Mutual Recognition\" means there are \" Mutual recognition agreements lay down the conditions under which one Party (non-member country) will accept conformity assessment results (e.g. testing or certification) performed by the other's Party (the EU) designated conformity assessment bodies (CABs) to show compliance with the first Party's (non-member country) requirements and vice versa. MRAs include relevant lists of designated laboratories, inspection bodies and conformity assessment bodies in both the EU and the third country.\" In other words it is nothing to do with the country (the UK in this case) maintaining the same internal regulations as the EU, but it is about UK labs being able to certify that UK produced goods conform to EU standards and so can ne exported there. No nothing to do with \"mad max\" scenarios.  I do not see how this solves the Irish border issue. If truck or van drives up the border it will still be necessary to confirm that the goods on that vehicle have the EU conformity test certifications in just the same was as goods from the USA would require certification. So in my opinion what Davis said today is meaningless, of course goods going to the EU have to conform to EU standards, \"mutual Recognition\" does not mean the EU will accept goods that conform to just UK standards.  \n"], [1333, "2018-02-20T14:27:33Z", [0.0, 0.45, 0.55], ""], [22994, "2018-02-20T14:05:27Z", [0.65, 0.25, 0.1], ""], [30899, "2018-02-20T10:32:17Z", [0.0, 0.2, 0.8], ""], [14493, "2018-02-19T18:23:13Z", [0.05, 0.15, 0.8], "The idea of a no-deal Brexit is now being spoken of by MPs as not going to happen and Labour MPs seem to think that the Labour Party official policy is likely at some point to come out in favour of staying in the Single Market/Customs Union.

After the Brexit vote, in June 2016 S&P cut the UK\u2019s rating from AAA to AA (2 notches), Fitch cut from AA+ to AA, and Moody\u2019s cut the outlook to negative.  In September 2017, Moody\u2019s downgraded from Aa1 to Aa2 with a stable outlook, stating that Brexit was creating economic uncertainty, exacerbating the UK\u2019s poor progress on debt reduction. Moody\u2019s explained that the UK was increasing spending on health and social care, among other areas.  In October 2017, S&P and Fitch both reaffirmed their AA ratings, both with a negative outlook. Specifically, S&P cited that further downgrades might follow if there\u2019s an increase in the likelihood of a disorderly Brexit or if overseas investors withdraw capital that finances the UK\u2019s current account deficit. Fitch mentioned the lack of a clear British position, the EU stance, and limited time before the 29 March 2019 departure date are looking unfavorable for the UK.  Additionally, May\u2019s substantially weakened position after the snap 2017 election created uncertainty over any long-term implementation.

Or at least the probable options. The media have added some spin to what Macron said which can be ignored. The two options on offer to the UK will be (a) a free trade deal excluding services (specifically financial services) similar to Canada (b) a deal similar to Norway that could include financial services and could include being in the Customs Union. \nThe problem with (a) is that it does not offer any answer to how the agreement that the border between the UK and Ireland will have no controls (in practice introducing 3rd country controls on most UK borders with the EU would be a massive problem and cost), and it does not help the UK's need for full access to the EU Single Market. Polls are indicating that most voters want the UK to remain in the Single Market and Customs Union. So this (the \"Canada\" option seems less likely to be chosen by the UK) Option (b) which would be \"Norway+, (or EEA, or EU minus)\" in the Single Market, in the Customs Union (which Norway is not) and to all intents and purposes would be almost exactly the same as being in the EU. This would solve the Irish Border problem and could solve the Financial Services issue. The problem for the UK Government would be that it would require payments to the EU to continue, 3rd party free trade deals could not be made by the UK and the UK would be subject to EFTA Court (which is pretty similar to the ECJ.  None of the options would give the UK what Mrs May said she wanted because what she said she wants is contradictory. \"No border checks\" is impossible unless the UK is in the same Single Market and Customs Union. In order for the UK to be in a Single Market and Customs Union with the EU that did not have the ECJ as its Court all 27 other countries in the EU would need to agree to changing how the EU's Single Market and Customs Union is structured. There appears to be zero chance of that happening.  The direction of travel suggests that option (b) is the most likely to end up being agreed. Few voters seem to believe that Mrs May will be able get a good Brexit deal. In this the voters seem a lot more realistic that the UK Government. So given that 65% of voters are not expecting a good deal it can be assumed that being faced with two options neither of which actually meets what Mrs May wants, they will expect the government to choose the least bad option. \nOption (a) is likely to lead to voters in N. Ireland demanding a referendum on uniting with Eire, which could lead to N. Ireland leaving the UK, which could encourage Scotland to do the same. According to (almost) all economic studies option (a) would cause more economic damage (including an S&P Downgrade). \nOption (b) would mean less known economic damage but would not give the perceived advantages of leaving the EU   (i.e. it would be pointless) but to reject (b) would require voters to believe what the Brexiteers told them. Having previously told voters that the EU would give exactly the same friction less access to the EU as  being a member did, but with the ability to do 3rd party trade deals, no payments, no freedom of movement etc. and that doing such a deal would \"take an afternoon\" because it was \"the easiest trade deal in history\", would voters believe them? So I think Brexit risk is already included in S&P's view, what might not be is the possibility of another economic crisis due to the cumulative effect of spending cuts of public services forcing public spending to rise and/or the collapse of zombie businesses that have only been able to keep going by cutting investment and borrowing cheap money. I don't think the UK's economic fundamentals look good.  \nIf on the other hand the UK unexpectedly abandoned Brexit there could be an investment boom.  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-42757026\nhttps://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/majority-back-continued-single-market-membership-after-brexit-new-poll-finds-a3744116.html\nhttps://whatukthinks.org/eu/questions/if-a-second-eu-referendum-were-held-today-how-would-you-vote/\nhttps://whatukthinks.org/eu/questions/how-confident-or-not-are-you-that-theresa-may-can-secure-a-good-brexit-deal-for-the-uk/"], [23704, "2018-01-20T06:34:33Z", [0.0, 0.45, 0.55], ""], [691, "2018-01-19T21:02:13Z", [0.0, 0.51, 0.49], ""], [46458, "2018-01-19T08:01:11Z", [0.15, 0.85, 0.0], "Brexit effect on Brits economy and EU uncertainty of how it will impact the EU"], [49293, "2018-01-19T03:06:50Z", [0.0, 0.35, 0.65], ""], [601, "2018-01-19T00:19:18Z", [0.0, 0.37, 0.63], ""], [691, "2018-01-17T23:08:20Z", [0.0, 0.51, 0.49], ""], [43711, "2018-01-17T16:23:17Z", [0.5, 0.5, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2018-01-17T15:17:48Z", [0.0, 0.55, 0.45], ""], [49148, "2018-01-17T10:03:09Z", [0.05, 0.6, 0.35], ""], [46579, "2018-01-17T09:38:56Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [48855, "2018-01-16T20:36:25Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [48913, "2018-01-16T18:58:27Z", [0.0, 0.65, 0.35], "I hear negotiations are not going well.

There have been questions asked as to how big the total PFI debts are; the UK Government does not seem to have the figures. \nIt is part of the nature of financial scares that some seemingly small, contained event, prompts markets to take another look at wider cases and then realise that what had appeared to be an isolated failure is more systemic than had been accounted for. If in looking at Carillion markets notice that there are lots of \"safe\" PFI companies (and other types of companies) that have huge levels of borrowing and that when companies that rely of chains of subcontractors to do their work go bust then that ripples through the construction chain (subcontractors who were owned money might also go bust, material suppliers might go bust.)  \nMaybe the Carillion failure can be contained but there is a risk that it could be a much bigger problem than it appears, and if it pushes up UK National Debt it could trigger a revision to the UK credit rating.

But it also warns that this may be as good as it gets - some companies could find it harder to service their debts once interest rates rise higher. Monica Insoll, a Fitch managing director, explains: \u201cThe rating outlook trend is the most upbeat in a decade, with positive outlooks outnumbering negatives.

Generally markets don't react well to downgrades to the world's strongest and most stable markets, and I think S&P won't issue a downgrade until it's a warning more likely to stabilize markets and warn off investors. S&P's warning that they might downgrade last summer was seen at the time as weaker than Moody's who did end up downgrading (http://www.businessinsider.com/sp-and-moodys-uk-credit-rating-general-election-cut-2017-6?r=UK&IR=T; also see @dsarin's useful paste of S&P's comments on their Oct decision not to downgrade http://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/672696).  One of the concerns cited in the fall by Fitch & S&P for deciding not downgrading when Moody's did was the stability of the Brexit process & May's govt (which hasn't been great but seems to be holding steady as well since December's deal on the first stage of the Brexit negotiations http://www.dw.com/en/british-pm-theresa-may-struggles-on-amid-brexit-uncertainty/a-42026025\nhttp://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2018/01/11/these-latest-brexit-poll-numbers-are-bad-news-for-theresa-may/\nhttps://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/898941/Brexit-Theresa-May-EU-politics-UK-Michel-Barnier-David-Davis-news-latest-European-Union).  Another major issue was the economic strength of the UK and the likelihood that Brexit/EU issues and the generally negative outlook would run off investors and lead them to withdraw existing investments.  Although the situation still looks pretty grim for the UK, it also doesn't seem to look as bad as was generally expected 6 months ago (https://www.ft.com/topics/themes/UK_economic_growth; https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/31/uk-economy-in-2018-steady-growth-tempered-by-brexit-politics).  S&P's warning last fall (http://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/672696) touches on a lot of reasonable fears, but the most likely to me seems to be political/constitutional issues re: Scotland & Ireland.  However, Sturgeon is putting off concerns about another Scottish referendum until late summer to see how the second round of Brexit negotiations go (http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nicola-sturgeon-says-she-wait-for-brexit-deal-to-decide-on-indyref2-a8159046.html).   For now.  Ireland has been much more tenuous, as predicted, over the border issues (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/12/04/__trashed/?utm_term=.a0e56d7fc0af; https://www.ft.com/content/983b64e8-d8e0-11e7-a039-c64b1c09b482). Recently Arlene Fosoter, DUP head, has indicated she wants to find some way to work out Brexit decisions and is trying to show willingness for talks but is still taking a hard line on what is needed to keep Ireland's trade and border connections best for Ireland and doesn't seem likely to concede significantly on her core points (https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/13/dup-leader-says-relations-with-irish-republic-not-under-threat-despite-brexit;\nhttps://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/government-welcomes-arlene-foster-s-support-for-closer-links-1.3355323;\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/brexit-ireland-arlene-foster-uk-mutual-interests-a8157901.html;\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/dec/08/arlene-foster-brexit-brinkmanship-rooted-in-a-border-childhood;\nhttps://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/904202/Brexit-news-EU-Arlene-Foster-Theresa-May-Britain-Irish-border-Ireland)\nEven with some significant concessions, the political situation in Northern Ireland doesn't look good (https://mg.co.za/article/2018-01-09-divided-over-brexit-nireland-marks-year-with-no-government).  The Ireland issue is much too deep into UK politics I don't understand, but it also seems to be the most certain place for political tensions to resist negotiations.  Not that people aren't clearly unhappy with Brexit, the conservative govt and ongoing austerity/economic hardships. The deadline for the second stage of the Brexit negotiations (trade relations & non-trade/security relations isn't until October, so it's not likely to put immediate breaking-point pressure on May, conservatives or the country's financial security.  I'm sure there will continue to be issues that come up, but S&P isn't likely to downgrade immediately - at least a month or more after a major issue, and probably only if it looks like it can't be salvaged, so probably 2-3+ months - which I think decreases odds on a downgrade by Oct even with the remaining uncertainties.  For now it seems like everyone's likely to keep waiting and going about their business.  Maybe things will look more desperate later in the spring & summer.  Certainly the second round of negotiations seems more challenging than anything else so far."], [1348, "2018-01-15T00:41:44Z", [0.0, 0.3, 0.7], ""], [23006, "2018-01-14T22:40:49Z", [0.02, 0.15, 0.83], ""], [48765, "2018-01-14T18:40:38Z", [0.4, 0.2, 0.4], ""], [47894, "2018-01-14T17:33:16Z", [0.0, 0.25, 0.75], ""], [1667, "2018-01-14T13:53:39Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.9], ""], [45778, "2018-01-14T11:04:31Z", [0.15, 0.6, 0.25], ""], [48494, "2018-01-14T10:41:55Z", [0.0, 0.85, 0.15], ""], [48707, "2018-01-14T07:08:19Z", [0.0, 0.36, 0.64], ""], [48705, "2018-01-14T05:46:39Z", [0.15, 0.35, 0.5], ""], [48704, "2018-01-14T05:31:21Z", [0.2, 0.35, 0.45], ""], [48694, "2018-01-14T02:31:20Z", [0.0, 0.5, 0.5], "The correction is coming either way.
