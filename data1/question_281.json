Sangin, That Many Marines Died to Keep Shah and Nordland (2017) March 24, states that: KANDAHAR, Afghanistan \u2014 The Taliban captured the strategic district of Sangin in the southern province of Helmand on Thursday, according to local officials. It was the culmination of a yearlong offensive that took the lives of more combatants than any other fight for territory in Afghanistan. While spokesmen for the central government denied claims by the Taliban that the district had fallen to them, some conceded that the insurgents had overrun the district center and government facilities. But local Afghan government and military officials said there was no doubt Sangin had finally fallen to their enemy. A spokesman for the American military, Capt. William K. Salvin, played down the development, saying Afghan security forces were still in the district and had merely moved its seat of government. \u201cThey re-positioned the district center,\u201d he said. \u201cThis move to a new district center has been planned for some time.\u201d More British troops and, later, American Marines died in Sangin than in any of Afghanistan\u2019s roughly 400 other districts, until the international military coalition began turning it over to Afghan military forces in 2013. Since then, hundreds of Afghan soldiers and police officers have lost their lives defending Sangin, while American Special Operations soldiers and aerial bombing tried to prevent the collapse of the district, apparently without success. The district, a center of the lucrative opium trade, is strategically situated between the Helmand River and the border with Kandahar Province. \u201cSangin\u2019s location is very, very important,\u201d said Gen. Abdul Jabar Qahraman, President Ashraf Ghani\u2019s personal military envoy to Helmand Province, who recently offered his resignation over widespread corruption that he says is undermining the government\u2019s efforts there. \u201cBy capturing Sangin, the Taliban are now able to connect Helmand with Kandahar,\u201d General Qahraman said, referring to Afghanistan\u2019s second-largest city. \u201cAbandoning Sangin is a mistake, but the government is no longer able to keep forces there.\u201d Because of its strategic importance, the international coalition has invested heavily in defending Sangin, even after the American withdrawal of most combat forces from Afghanistan. In the years, before then, it was the site of substantial losses for both British and American forces. \u201cThis district was one of the most dangerous not just in Afghanistan but maybe in the whole world,\u201d Robert M. Gates, then the United States defense secretary, said in 2011 in Sangin, addressing the 3/5 Battalion of the United States Marines, which was deployed there. Those Marines had just \u201csuffered the heaviest losses of any battalion in this 10-year-long war,\u201d Mr. Gates said. \u201cIn the five months since you\u2019ve arrived here, you\u2019ve killed, captured or driven away most of the Taliban that called this place home,\u201d Mr. Gates said. By the end of the battalion\u2019s full seven-month deployment in Sangin, 29 members had died. Officials in the Afghan central government adamantly denied Thursday that such sacrifices had come to naught. \u201cIt is not true,\u201d Maj. Gen. Dawlat Waziri, the spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, said of the reports of Sangin\u2019s fall. \u201cWe relocated an army battalion in Sangin, we moved them to a newly built garrison. Whenever we move our forces in Sangin, they claim that they capture Sangin.\u201d Local government and military officials, however, said Thursday that the remaining battalion of Afghan National Army soldiers defending the town of Sangin and the district\u2019s government and military bases had pulled out overnight.

Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid described the relationship as \u201cjust political.\u201d\nBut the revelation coincides with other Russian moves in Afghanistan that appear aimed, as in the Middle East and Europe, at undermining U.S. influence and seeking regional parity with Washington.\nThe Kremlin held a conference in Moscow last month with China and Pakistan to discuss terrorist threats from Afghanistan and how to combat Islamic State. Since then, Russia has invited the Afghan government to participate in the continuing diplomatic initiative, but not the U.S.\nMoscow also has blocked the Afghan government\u2019s efforts to remove Gulbuddin Hekmatyar from a United Nations sanctions list, a crucial condition of an Afghan government peace deal with the warlord\u2019s al Qaeda-linked insurgent group. The deal, strongly supported by the U.S. and its allies, was viewed by the U.S. and other allies of the government as a template for future talks with the Taliban.\nWhile the Afghan government of President Ashraf Ghani has publicly criticized any support for the Taliban, one of the biggest boosters of Russian moves in Afghanistan is his predecessor, Hamid Karzai (para. 1-7).

for years to come as a new U.S. president takes over what is already America's longest war.\nIn a joint appearance in Kabul with Afghanistan's president, Ashraf Ghani, Carter said the U.S. cannot afford to give up on Afghanistan after more than 15 years of U.S. involvement, the deaths of more than 2,200 U.S. troops, and the expenditure of hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\"The interests we are pursuing here are clear and enduring,\" he said, citing the goals of preventing another 9/11-type of attack on American soil and helping Afghanistan attain enough stability to remain a long-term security partner for the U.S. and the West. The war began as a response to the 9/11 attacks.\n\"To have a stable security partner that is eager and willing to work with the United States is an asset for the future for us,\" Carter said (para. 1-5).\nThe U.S. has about 10,000 troops in Afghanistan to train and advise Afghan security forces combatting a resilient Taliban insurgency. U.S. special operations forces are hunting down al-Qaida and Islamic State militants (para. 8).\nCarter's visit comes amid concerns that despite improvements in Afghan government defenses, Taliban forces are gaining leverage and are continuing to use neighboring Pakistan as a sanctuary. By U.S. estimates, the Afghan government controls slightly less than two-thirds of the country's population.\nThe Taliban holds sway over about 10 percent, and the remainder of the population is \"contested.\"\nThe top US commander in Afghanistan said Friday \"the fundamental logic\" of the U.S. counterterrorism mission is solid, suggesting it should continue after the change of administrations (para. 8-11).\nBurns, R.

As per the Afghan constitution, Ghani is supposed to serve a 5-year term. He also appears to have recieved a clear (if somewhat disputed) majority of votes in the 2014 presidential election (http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2014/09/ashraf-ghani-declared-winner-afghan-poll-2014921133512174572.html) , making him as legitimate a head of government as anyone. As far as I know there isn't a legislative mechanism to oust him, so the plausible \"Yes\" results here would come from a coup, a Taliban takeover, or Ghani dying.  Abdullah Abdullah would be the next plausible candidate, but does not seem likely to initiate a coup, unless Ghani's government tries to oust him as CEO. Both Afghan leaders seem to be working together this week in Brussels (http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/afghanistan-seeks-3b-aid-corruption-concerns-persist-42522878), which seems to indicate that they both see the other man (and, presumably, the current arrangement) as useful. The United States and EU have also made it clear to Ghani that Abdullah is a necessary part of the package (http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/10/world/asia/john-kerry-arrives-in-afghanistan-with-message-of-support.html), which would presumably dissuade Ghani from attempting to oust him.  Assuming this conference delivers the sought $3b in aid (which it seems that it will), Ghani then has a couple of things going for him.  The Western donors in Brussels, as well as the United States (which gives something like $5b a year to Afghanistan) are making the money contingent on reforms, especially fighting corruption. Ghani appears to be the only major politician in the country who gets an A in not being corrupt (http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/28/world/asia/afghanistan-corruption-financial-disclosure.html), which means that the international community have some interest in keeping him in charge.  NATO has also reaffirmed its security commitments (http://country.eiu.com/article.aspx?articleid=1764403960&Country=Afghanistan&topic=Politics&subtopic=Forecast&subsubtopic=Country+outlook) which would seem to be a buffer against both a coup and the Taliban.  I would also account for some chance that the upcoming loya jirga might oust Ghani, but I consider this to be fairly minor. First, it's unclear if it will actually get together ahead of 7/1/17. Assuming it does, the fact that as president Ghani will essentially control the organization of it makes it seem like at the very least he'll probably at least get them to let him finish his term.
