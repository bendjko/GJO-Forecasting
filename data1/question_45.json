On the other hand, this may dissipate soon due to weather or the actual clamp-down (if it were to come).\n3) Will the UNHCR folks take the Holiday season off and not update on, say Dec 30 and 31?

Current total 147.000 till end of October for both countries was 147.000, my calculation is that this will increase the numbers till end of December by : 3.000 - 5.000. 2. Greece is 84% of all total arrivals so far in 2015. In November 2014, the arrivals to Greece dropped to 51% of the October arrivals, with December being 28% of the October numbers. For 2015, the november number is 65%, -appreciatly higher, mostly due to the better weather conditions and deteriorting conditions and the perceived possibility of closing borders in Europe. For December the numbers could add : 70.000 - 90.000  3.   The Greek numbers are not complete as Symi, Agathonisi, Tilos and Crete are not added yet for the period after October, however this constituted only 3% of all arrivals in September.  4.   The total reported on the site (today being the 9th of December) is 922.000. In the excel however a lower 917.000 is reported in the excel. The difference is not Malta as they only report 150 arrivals.  My calculation yields 990.000 to 1.012.000, based on the above numbers and taking 917.000 from the excel slide as the base number. As close as it gets.  I expect more than one million to be a likelier outcome as the current weather forecast is very mild for Lesbos, the island with most arrivals [3]. Even though Turkey is starting to turn back refugees [4]. Another is that Germany reports already having registered more than 1 mln refugees which points to the UNHCR numbers might see an upward revision.  Responses are most welcome.\nCompliments for Dima K for the hyperbola reasoning and pointing out that the numbers point to a very close call.

I'm looking at the numbers in three ways. The first deals with the number of refugees this month. So far (Dec 8th), there are just over 25,000, according to this report: http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/regional.php\nIt also says there are about 911,500, meaning that 88,500 more refugees need to arrive for a total of about 113,500 this month. If you take the current level of arrivals for about the first quarter of December as a constant, only 75,000 more refugees will arrive, meaning there will be less than one million by 13,500 extra refugees.\nWe must also consider that the number of refugees will continue to drop off as it gets colder and later into December. The other way of looking at it is difficult and I'm not a math person so someone please correct me if I'm wrong. It looks at the percentage increase of refugees from 2014 to 2015. \nAugust 2014-15: 291% increase\nSeptember 2014-15: 409% increase\nOctober 2014-15: 857% increase\nNovember 2014-15: 952% increase December 2014-15 would require a 1,152% increase to meet 114,000 for the month and make 1 million refugees. \nHowever, while the rate of change went up significantly from August to September to October (40.% and 109.5% respectively), it has decreased to an 11% increase from November to October. It would need to recover to 21% from November to December to make 1,152%. It's completely possible but does not seem likely given the current trend. Finally, We must also consider that the number of refugees will continue to drop off as it gets colder and later into December. In both 2014 and 2015, numbers dropped off significantly from October to November to December (and onward). \nIn 2014 October to November, there was a 42% decrease in refugees. From November to December, there was a 32% decrease.\nIn 2015, there was a 36.5% decrease from October to November. This is only 5.5 percentage points away from last year for a rate of change of -13%. Continued, this would mean that December 2015 would see a drop off of 27.8% from November, meaning there will be only about 101,000 refugees--12,500 away from 1 million. To get those extra 12,500, the drop from November to December this year would have to be only ~19%.

Now its 118,448 souls to go, this has been exceeded ever since August when the situation seemed to get really serious and doubled.  My judgment is that desperation has not subsided.  Traffickers get paid on success not attempts, so what is confusing me is the number of dead / lost at sea.  Its the same as last year with so many more people.  Its not really moved that much either in the last few weeks / months.  I was expecting it to soar in the last two months (glad I was wrong), but that was a key driver down in my model that has just not come through.

Are the traffickers more or less likely to carry these desperate people?  Provided the boats get across they will do it, that much is clear.  Will turkey who are now being seemingly incentivised to stop the flow be adequate counter to peoples desperation and illegal traffickers who can arguably ask for more now to bribe the officers sent to stop them?

Right now, we're up to approximately 850,000 and today is November 21st. There have been approximately 100,000 welcomed in November. However, as others have shown, the main country that's welcoming refugees right now is Greece. When we look at Greece's November number vs. \"all\" countries November number, let's call it a wash (104k for all countries, 100k for Greece). However, The last update for Greece was November 19th.  For the sake of quick mathematics, let's just say that November is two-thirds complete and that the November total is 100,000 -- even.  At this point, that means we have one third of November remaining and all of December. Let's assume that the number of refugees who make it to Greece in November will equal the same rate as the first two-thirds of November. That means, another 50,000 refugees to Greece by the end of November, which would bring the total to 900,000 with the whole of December remaining.  Let's also consider the rate for December staying the same for the rate of November. That would mean, we're looking at 1,050,000 refugees in total. We can be fairly positive that the rate for December won't be greater than the rate for November, so we're looking at a ceiling of 1,050,000. Now, the rub here is, do we think that the rate will stay high enough such that it will still stay above 1,000,000, by the year's end? To my mind, 50,000 isn't enough of a buffer for me to put my confidence in the \"million + option.\" ~~ In looking at the rate decreasing, we could look at last year's (which seemed to really hurt some of our forecasts early on) or we could look at the recent decrease. That is, look at the decrease from October to November. If we assume that November finishes with 150,000, that means that from October to November, there would have been a total decrease of 70,000 (220,000 in October).  Of course, the rate decrease won't necessarily stay the same, but given that we're dealing with a 50,000-buffer, I'm more comfortable \"investing\" in the \"between 710k and 1million\" option, until I see the data begin to perform better than this quick math. ~~~~ Oh, one last thing -- I doubled back to GJ's FAQs --> https://www.gjopen.com/faq Q. What are the deadlines for the questions? When do events need to occur in order for them to count towards the resolution of the question? Time Zone: Unless otherwise specified, GJ will use Pacific Time to evaluate deadlines (e.g., if the forecasting question asks about an event occurring before 31 December 2015, the deadlines is 23:59:59 31 PT on 31 December 2015). \u201cBefore\u201d vs \u201cAs Of\u201d: When a question asks about a situation \"as of\" a certain date, the question and all answer options will generally remain open until the specified end date. The goal of these questions is to gauge how a situation will look at a certain point in time. For questions about events occurring \"before\" or \"by\" a certain date, the question and/or individual answer options will generally close as soon as an event has transpired prior to the specified end date. ~~~~~~ COMMENT: Meaning, at midnight in San Francisco on December 31st is what will be used to score this question UNLESS someone has got clarification that GJ plans to wait a couple of days after Dec 31st. Based on the wording, I would gather that they won't be extending beyond the deadline (i.e. the question wording is clear).

Had 6600 arrive 9/25, dropped to 2200 next day.  Were averaging ~5000/day, but dropped to ~3300 for recent 6 days, with as low as 1500 arrivals on one of those days.

To reach 560000 only requires an average just shy of 25000 per month, this would represent a huge decrease over the numbers currently arriving in Greece by sea."], [505, "2015-09-21T23:30:55Z", [0.25, 0.5, 0.25, 0.0], ""], [102, "2015-09-21T23:23:03Z", [0.0, 0.55, 0.3, 0.15], "Gut feeling."], [38, "2015-09-21T23:07:44Z", [0.25, 0.6, 0.13, 0.02], "another approach:\nIn 2014, the last 3 months + 1/4 Sept = 24.975% of the total migrants in 2014.\nAssuming the same monthly distribution in 2015, then the total by CYE 2015 would be 637,662 It seems like the stream of refugees is constantly increasing, but I'm increasing the mid-range because I'm thinking that now that we've announced we'll take 100k, a significant number of would-be boat people will decide to try to get to the US rather than risk the boat trip."], [38, "2015-09-21T22:42:15Z", [0.18, 0.55, 0.22, 0.05], "My sense is that the rate of migration is increasing, but the rate of sea migration may slow since we're entering winter.

Looking at sea migrant/refugee arrivals in Europe over 2014 and 2015, two obvious things: lots more people in 2015, and there is a seasonality to sea arrivals.  Drop in sea arrivals during last quarter of the year may be due to other effects, perhaps conflict intensity, but would expect there to be a weather component - (eg. mistral, bora, sirocco winds). Haven't yet found monthly data for previous years. Thus far in 2015, there have been 449,421 sea arrivals.  I'm going to assume that is through Sept 20, not sure but the numbers were a bit lower in Sept 15 report.  If the last bit of Sept continues on the same pace as earlier, likely to be close to the August numbers => around 130,000 sea arrivals for Sept.  I can think of various reasonable ways to estimate the expected sea arrivals for the remainder of the year:  use last year's numbers, use last year's numbers increased to reflect mean monthly increase for 2015 vs 2014, use last year's numbers but use the highly increased rate seen in August, almost 4x the 2014 number, or project monthly numbers for remainder of year using same % of peak 2014 numbers as seen in corresponding month.   A result greater than 710,000 looks unlikely to me, but it is possible that we'll see drops in sea arrivals that keep the number below 560,000 for 2015. In addition to weather, conceivable that there will be a drop in sea arrivals due to increased awareness of deaths on that route.  Also possible that the crisis will continue to escalate, with corresponding increase in numbers.
