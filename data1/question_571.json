Using only 2 years of data, the total predicted was 1.034m. Using 3 years, total pred was 1.044m. With all 7 years, total pred was 1.051m.  I attempted to see if trends in youth tackle football could help me decide which sample set to use. A Washington Post article suggests that from 2008-2014, US youth participation in football dropped from 8.2 to 5.7% of all children, a relative decrease of 30% over 6 years! This is important because many of the youths are now high-school aged and kids who did not play organized football as children are probably less likely to play in high school as well. Factoring in widespread concerns about CTE, I believe 2018 participation will trend towards the lower side - more similar to last year's decline. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/recruiting-insider/wp/2017/09/06/youth-sports-study-declining-participation-rising-costs-and-unqualified-coaches/?utm_term=.1241b812f69a"], [55748, "2018-03-03T22:48:31Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [53760, "2018-03-03T17:00:09Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [29980, "2018-03-03T13:40:12Z", [0.98, 0.01, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [55601, "2018-03-02T08:04:23Z", [0.05, 0.2, 0.5, 0.15, 0.1], ""], [23006, "2018-03-01T18:44:13Z", [0.03, 0.28, 0.36, 0.25, 0.08], ""], [48709, "2018-03-01T00:12:51Z", [0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.12, 0.85], "time adjustment will come "], [691, "2018-02-28T15:12:30Z", [0.08, 0.54, 0.37, 0.01, 0.0], ""], [15477, "2018-02-27T12:39:52Z", [0.0, 0.2, 0.6, 0.2, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2018-02-26T18:45:58Z", [0.1, 0.45, 0.45, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [32100, "2018-02-26T17:42:35Z", [0.0, 0.4, 0.5, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [6782, "2018-02-25T22:54:37Z", [0.9, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [54684, "2018-02-25T22:01:57Z", [0.1, 0.6, 0.2, 0.0, 0.1], ""], [55099, "2018-02-25T20:09:46Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2], ""], [54996, "2018-02-25T06:48:05Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.45, 0.4], ""], [47216, "2018-02-25T06:21:35Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [40998, "2018-02-24T19:31:44Z", [0.08, 0.28, 0.36, 0.27, 0.01], ""], [40998, "2018-02-24T19:28:31Z", [0.22, 0.4, 0.3, 0.07, 0.01], ""], [691, "2018-02-24T13:21:28Z", [0.08, 0.54, 0.37, 0.01, 0.0], ""], [54946, "2018-02-24T04:45:04Z", [0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.6, 0.1], ""], [1993, "2018-02-23T06:14:50Z", [0.05, 0.55, 0.3, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [23006, "2018-02-23T05:54:16Z", [0.03, 0.17, 0.36, 0.36, 0.08], ""], [54315, "2018-02-23T01:48:49Z", [0.8, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05], "CTE news continues to alarm.  reductions in 17-18 will be higher than in 15-16"], [43311, "2018-02-21T22:33:38Z", [0.05, 0.45, 0.45, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [54145, "2018-02-20T22:22:44Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], "football will never go to zero. but smart schools and parents will advocate and make the switch to soccer.

Given the growing social awareness of CTE and concussions in general, and the many other alternative sports that are out there, we should expect the trend to continue. This question is structured in a way that if the same 29k drop occurs, we would predict the lowest result amongst the answers. I think that this is a reasonable probability. Another interesting effect that could contribute - the drop in US population due to immigrants fears of current policies.

Undoubtedly the continuing news and education (and even movies) about CTE is getting through.  Stats on kids younger than high-school age are significant to track also. Some brain experts say football head hits before age 14 can do even more damage due to incomplete myelin sheath protective formation around brain nerves. Society is slowly changing about tackle football. Parents of boys who play or are interested in playing football should be paying attention. Flag football provides a good substitute.
