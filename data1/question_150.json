B. Confirmation in the lame duck session in late 2016 - less than 1% as well. \n - Democrats win the White House (currently the consensus at GJ Open is about 75%)\n - Democrats gain majority in the Senate (60%)\n - Republicans get scared that Clinton will propose someone less palatable (5%). This is rather unlikely: Suppose Clinton does decide to propose something else. Wouldn't she then just ask Obama to withdraw the nomination of Garland, rather than risk an accidental approval in the lame duck session? Knowing this, as long as Garland's nomination is still standing, would the Republicans really get scared by the possibility of withdrawal?

None would go on the record, citing the sensitivities surrounding the issue. But there\u2019s broad agreement about who Clinton would be most likely to consider, not only for the vacancy already on the court, but also the additional ones that could open up over the next four years if liberals like Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Justice Anthony Kennedy were to retire. Topping the list, insiders say, is Garland\"[1]. If the Hill's source's are right, and Judge Garland *really* is at the top of HRC's list, then R Senators really have no reason to confirm him. Imagine that the following is really a 2x2 matrix (which won't show up properly formatted in the comments, alas):   * Confirm Garland and HRC Wins: Moderate as newest Supreme Court Justice\n* Confirm Garland and Mr. Drumpf Wins: Moderate as newest Supreme Court Justice\n* Don't confirm Garland and HRC Wins: Moderate as newest Supreme Court Justice\n* Don't confirm Garland and Mr. Drumpf Wins: Conservative as newest Supreme Court Justice The choice not to confirm Garland weakly dominates[2] the choice to confirm him, since R Senators will be better off if Mr. Drumpf wins and no worse off if HRC wins.  However, this is a non-cooperative game[3], so HRC can't bind her future self to nominate Judge Garland next year. Indeed, why would she? If I were HRC, I might try to signal that I was going to nominate Judge Garland so that R Senators didn't confirm him during the lame duck session after my victory (provided I won) so that I could nominate someone more to my taste in 2017. And R Senators can think this far ahead if I can.

Burwell (contraception), back to lower courts, which is somewhat of a disappointment to women\u2019s rights groups, who had won the majority of lower courts cases.

Four things have made me somewhat more pessimistic.   * On the Republican side, Trump is actually trying to act rational.  He put out a list of possible candidates that - although not perfect for Republicans - was safe enough, and conservative enough, and non confrontational enough.  Further, Trump is somewhat starting to get Republicans behind him somewhat.  He's actually starting to act like an adult.  Who would have thought.\n\n* On the Democratic side, Bernie has gone from the candidate with the lofty ideas and torch to being a bit of a revolutionary.  He acts like his ideas and winning are more important to him than the democrats and liberals as a whole.  He is somewhat poisoning the liberal wing by arguing that the process is unfair and rigged, not just issues.  He is becoming disruptive, and starting to fracture the Democratic party.  I can't read how hard it will be to put back together.  Again, who would have thought. * Although I know he is doing his best, Garland and Pres. Obama have not been making big waves with regards to the Supreme Court.  In fact, the court itself is making more waves as they push cases back down to lower courts for \"compromises\".

Politico tells us that \"Democrats are getting badly outspent by their conservative rivals in the war over Merrick Garland\u2019s confirmation, suggesting that President Barack Obama\u2019s closest allies in the Supreme Court battle have more bark than bite...The muscular spending from GOP-backed groups shows how dug-in conservatives are over their Garland blockade, and has helped keep almost all Senate Republicans moving in lockstep\"[1]. Sounds bad for the Ds. But does money matter here? I can't quite see how the mechanism is supposed to work (or, more exactly, work well). More important, I think is the near inevitability of Mr. Drumpf's nomination[2] and his less than stelar chances in the general election[3]. These facts might throw a spanner into the works. R Senators could be willing to make their peace with the Garland nomination in order to avoid getting a nominee to his left after HRC enters office. Yet the Senators probably needn't be in a rush. If HRC wins, they could approve Mr. Garland after the election[4][5]. Now here's an interesting wrinkle: Some folks on the right even fear what will happen if Mr. Drumpf is elected: \"If Drumpf has a choice between an originalist conservative with sterling credentials who would often block Drumpf, and buddy of his who hasn't read the Constitution but would let Drumpf do what he wants, who do you think Drumpf would pick?\"[6]. Mr Drumpf has repeatedly promised to provide a list of possible nominees, but he hasn't delivered yet[7]. Maybe it's just as well; his mercurial nature would render such a list out-of-date before we ever saw it. So if HRC wins, then approve Mr. Garland after the election, and if Mr. Drumpf wins, then approve Mr. Garland after the election. Therefore, approve Mr. Garland after the election? Well, maybe. Here are some things that might, just might, stand in the way: (a) HRC wins, but President Obama withdraws Mr. Garland's name in deference to the incoming president. \n(b) HRC wins, but Senate Rs can't get their act together to approve Mr. Garland during the lame duck session.\n(c) HRC wins, and Senate Ds  think they can do better than Mr. Garland.\n(d) Mr. Drumpf wins, and Senate Rs think they can do better than Mr. Garland.\n(e) That thing I said before about another Supreme Court Justice dying might happen.\n(f) Something I haven't thought of yet. While (a) could happen[8], I don't know of any evidence that President Obama is actually considering this possibility. HRC has said, if she wins the election, she won't ask Mr. Obama do withdraw Mr. Garland's nomination[9]. While she could easily reverse course on this point, I'm not sure she'd have that much to gain by doing so. On the contrary, if the Senate confirms Mr. Garland after the presidential election, she'll have one less fight with the Senate on her hands. Low probability - call it 10%. I think (b) is more likely[10]. In order for the Senate to confirm Mr. Garland, Sen. Grassley would have to relent and somehow find a way to save face after repeatedly saying \"No way, Jose\"[11]. But Sen. Cruz's remarkably fast climbdown from \"We're in it to win it\" to \"Sayonara, suckers\" is a reminder that a post-haste volte-face that seemed unlikely can happen when conditions change. In addition to Sen. Grassley's embrace of pretzel logic, there would have to be enough Sen. Rs and Ds who are in the mood to give the Garland nomination priority. That's not a given. Surely, some departing R senators will have some last minute business to attend to, and that might soak up whatever time is available to deal with Mr. Garland's nomination. And voters are less interested in this sort of thing than I used to think[12]. From a distance Senate Rs might look like a unified bunch, but they have some sharply divergent interests, and that might keep them from doing what might be in all of their interests. Fairly probable - call it 30%. I love (c), but I think it's pretty damn unlikely. Strictly speaking, the Rs would need only 6 Ds in order to confirm Mr. Garland. Even if they had a lot of R defections, I feel pretty confident that they could scrounge up 15-20 Ds. Only a D filibuster could stop the process, and that's the last card that Ds would want to play in these circumstances (assuming that an HRC victory brings with it control of the Senate). Very low probability - call it 1%. As for (d), I've already mentioned grumblings among the Rs that Mr. Drumpf would unlikely to provide a candidate who is, all things considered, superior to Mr. Garland. Thing is, those grumblings aren't, to the best of my knowledge, coming from Senate Rs. On the contrary, Sen. Chuck Grassley has said that \"there\u2019s no problem with\" Mr. Drumpf \"appointing people to the Supreme Court\"[13]. Low probability - call it 5%. I'd say (e) is still pretty damn unlikely but interesting nonetheless[14]. Very low probability - call it 1%. And (f)? Well, I could use some help, and I'll reevaluate as soon as I get some. Since I currently think HRC is a 71/29 favorite over Mr. Drumpf[15], I must think that the odds that Mr. Garland will be appointed are something like this: (0.71*.59) + (0.29*0.06) = 0.43. That's certainly a higher probability than I had earlier thought, largely because of the Ds increased probability of taking the White House. -- [1] http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/gop-supreme-court-merrick-garland-222898#ixzz48MMHag1k\n[2] https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/228739\n[3] https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/230497\n[4] http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-garland-idUSKCN0WJ251\n[5] http://www.wsj.com/articles/gop-plots-its-path-on-merrick-garland-supreme-court-nomination-1458169679\n[6] Quoted at http://mediamatters.org/research/2016/05/10/conservative-lawyers-warn-against-allowing-trump-pick-supreme-court-justices/210331\n[7] http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/05/trumps-possible-scotus-radicalism.html?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Daily%20Intelligencer%20-%20May%209%2C%202016&utm_term=Subscription%20List%20-%20Daily%20Intelligencer%20%281%20Year%29\n[8] https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/03/17/how-obama-could-get-last-laugh-in-supreme-court-fight/\n[9] http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-live-updates-democr-sanders-if-elected-id-ask-obama-to-withdraw-gar-1460689474-htmlstory.html\n[10] http://www.businessinsider.com/r-key-republicans-open-to-handling-garland-nomination-after-us-election-2016-3\n[11] http://www.politico.com/story/2016/03/chuck-grassley-defends-supreme-court-block-220567\n[12] http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2016/05/09/3776434/support-republican-partys-plans-supreme-court-collapsed/\n[13] http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2016/05/10/3776868/senate-judiciary-chair-no-problem-trump-appointing-people-supreme-court/\n[14] https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/182318\n[15] https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/230497"], [1827, "2016-05-11T20:10:38Z", [0.8], ""], [16355, "2016-05-11T18:05:24Z", [0.1], ""], [16253, "2016-05-11T17:03:35Z", [0.62], "(If) it appears that Dems will win the WH.

Currently, the consensus on GJ is that the GOP has 40% chance of retaining senate and 35% chance of winning presidency. 1) Republicans retain senate and Trump wins presidency (31% no).  Since the results of congressional elections are usually correlated with the results from the presidential election, I will assume that if Trump wins the presidency, the GOP will likely retain the senate (90%). In this scenario, it is unlikely that a new supreme court justice will be appointed before 20 Jan. \n2) Republicans retain senate and Clinton wins presidency (9% yes). In this case, I think it is likely that the senate will vote to confirm Justice Garland in the lame duck session of congress. They will lose their justification for not holding a vote, and presumably they will vote to confirm.\n3) Democrats win senate and Trump wins presidency (4% yes) This actually is a very interesting scenario. Since the senate is sworn in at the beginning of January while Obama is president, they can hold a vote and confirm Garland so that Trump will not be able to fill this vacancy. I think this is the most likely outcome in this very unlikely scenario.\n4) Democrats win senate and Clinton wins presidency (56%: 50% no, 6% yes) In this scenario, I think it is unlikely that a new justice will be appointed. Clinton will preferably want a younger and more liberal justice to be appointed to the court. I will reserve 6% for appointed before 20 Jan for the following possibilities (2% each): \na) Obama does not withdraw nominee and GOP votes to confirm in lame duck session\nb) Clinton asks Obama not to withdraw the nominee and DEM senate confirms in new year before Clinton is sworn in.\nc) Clinton asks Obama to submit a new name after the senate is sworn in and before she is sworn in so that she can focus on other things in the first 100 days.

Suppose, she writes, that \"another spot opened up on the court between now and November -- especially one of the liberal spots. Suddenly, instead of replacing a conservative with a moderate, Republicans can replace a liberal with a moderate. And wait until they (ostensibly) win November's election to fill Scalia's spot\"[a]. That's not a crazy theory, not at all! And it's not as unlikely as I first thought. I doubt that any of the current Supreme Court liberals is likely to go voluntarily unless he/she thinks he/she can be replaced with someone of a similar political disposition. I believe that the only way we'd see a liberal leave under the current state of things is via disease, injury, or death (God forbid). Justice Sotomayor was born in 1954 (probability of death in next 12 months = 0.007602), and Justice Kagan was born 6 years later (probability of death in next 12 months = 0.004920). So the probability that either will die before the next president is sworn in is almost 0, out to 2 decimal places. But this is where things get interesting (in a ghoulish way). Justice Breyer was born in 1938, and his probability of death in next 12 months is much higher - shockingly to me: 0.049664. And Notorious RBG is 5 years older then Justice Breyer and thus has an expected mortality rate of 0.060909[b]. (I do not report this fact with relish. RBG is a national treasure.) So we're looking at something like a probability of 0.123095 that at least 1 of the liberal justice will die in the next year. Adjust that for the fact that we're only interest in the next 10 months for the purposes of this question, and we get a 0.10257916666 chance that at least 1 of the liberal justices will die before the next president is sworn in. For Pete's sake, let's just call this 10%. This could certainly happen. In fact, I think that it's more likely that at least 1 of the liberal justices will die before the presidential election than that Senator Cruz will be the Republican nominee! When one adds to the mix the fact that I've only considered mortality rates and not the likelihood of other events that might cause a Justice to retire, it really begins to seem like we need to think hard about this possibility.  Despite all of this, I'm not as confident as Ms. Phillips that the Congressional Republicans would go for it. Senator McConnell has left himself a little wiggle room, I suppose. \"[T]he American people are choosing their next president and their next president should pick ***this*** Supreme Court nominee\"[c, my emphasis]. So Senator McConnell might claim, somehow, that President Obama should pick another Supreme Court nominee. But he doesn't have much incentive to do so. If a Republican wins the White House in the fall, then that would mean two new conservative Justices, and if a Democrat wins, Senator McConnell and friends can continue to play keep away for a long time. After all, conservatives would outnumber liberals 4-to-3 on a court without 1 of its liberal current Justices. So there's something to Ms. Phillips' suggestion, but I don't think it fundamentally alters the state of the playing field. I'm bumping up my estimate of the likelihood that a new Supreme Court Justice will be approved by 1% to 29%, right where it started earlier this afternoon. -- [a] https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/03/20/4-scenarios-that-could-still-put-merrick-garland-on-the-supreme-court/ [b] http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/how-ruth-bader-ginsburg-became-the-notorious-rbg-20151027 [c] http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/03/20/mcconnell-white-house-spar-over-supreme-court-nomination-hearings.html All actuarial data taken from https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html"], [6783, "2016-03-21T00:56:10Z", [0.05], ""], [15923, "2016-03-21T00:14:18Z", [0.55], ""], [38, "2016-03-21T00:06:50Z", [0.66], "Sen McConnell is digging in his heels, and he controls the senate calendar.

Here's my reasoning. There's been a fair amount of speculation about whether Congressional Republicans might rush Judge Garland through the approval process during the lame duck portion of the Mr. Obama's presidency, if HRC wins the 2016 contest. In my last forecast, I assigned this event a low but positive probability. However, I'm coming to think that even this probability wasn't low enough. Senator McConnell is now strongly signaling that he wouldn't allow that to happen. This morning Senator McConnell said, \"The principle is the same, whether it\u2019s before the election or after the election....The principle is the American people are choosing their next president and their next president should pick this Supreme Court nominee.\" What if a Democrat wins the presidency, Senator McConnell was asked, and decides to appoint someone more liberal than Garland? \"It'd be hard to be more liberal than Merrick Garland\"[a]. Read that last sentence a few times. Really? Senator McConnell, I served with left liberals. I knew left liberals. Left liberals were friends of mine. Senator McConnell, Merrick Garland is no left liberal[b].  Anyway, I mention this because Senator McConnell is (intentionally, I think) signaling that he has an active doomsday device[c]. He's making it very hard for himself and those he's supposed to be managing to change their minds later[d]. Neither Senator McConnell nor his colleagues want to be on record as confirming to the Supreme Court someone who he himself has described as being about as liberal as possible. There is reason to think that Senator McConnell might be vulnerable to a challenge from the right[e], and this would be ammunition for his opponent. In fairness, that election would be 4 years down the road, and McConnell would be 78 when his next term is up, so take this point with a grain of salt. I am. But I'm less sanguine about a lame duck appointment than I was a few days ago. -- [a]http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/03/20/mcconnell_says_republicans_won_t_vote_for_supreme_court_nominee_after_election.html\n[b] http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/18/us/politics/merrick-garlands-record-and-style-hint-at-his-appeal.html\n[c] http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2009/09/fun_with_nuclear_game_theory\n[d] http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.39.4797&rep=rep1&type=pdf, see Section V.\n[e] http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2013/01/24/ashley_judd_challenge_from_right_may_confront_mcconnell_116774.html"], [53, "2016-03-20T23:56:34Z", [0.6], "decided that McConnell seems like the kind who might well cut off his nose to spite his face.

Second (and more importantly), Gov. Kasich's has recently said that Senate Republicans who oppose even considering Garland's nomination \"probably ought to all sit down and meet with the guy\"[b]. Public opinion is pretty strongly behind giving Garland a hearing and a vote this year[c]. Moreover, \"[s]ome Republican voters, meanwhile, are disagreeing with GOP leaders on not considering Garland. In a Morning Consult poll released Friday, 43% of Republican voters said the Judiciary Committee should hold hearings. Thirty four percent said the committee should not\"[d].

But he would say that, wouldn't he?  Reid is probably best understood as trying to influence the outcome of events rather than reporting (with much reliability) on actual Republican machinations. So it seems to me. But there is a really interesting idea here, mentioned by @wrichars, @bongani, @Flieger19, @Jean-Pierre and others, that the Senate Republicans might stall the nomination until the election and then rush Garland through at the last second when a Democrat (0.97 probability = HRC) wins. That's a certainly a possibility. Let's give it some thought. Whether the Republicans have the motivation to rush Garland through at the buzzer depends on the fact that they might do even worse (from their perspective) than Garland under HRC[b]. But this scenario is no more likely than that of a Democratic presidential victory, something that I currently think has little more than a 0.50 probability (but that's another story). Importantly, even a Democratic presidential victory doesn't mean that the Senate must confirm whomever the newly minted commander-in-chief nominates. Scenario #1: The Senate remains in Republican hands (current probability = ca. 0.75). Republican leadership then decides that they would prefer to take their chances blocking any candidate for the SCOTUS to the left of Garland (probability = ca. 0.30). Why? Republicans might claim that the new president lacked a mandate because of her small margin of victory or because of what they might see as historic anomalies in the race (hint: something that rhymes with \"grump\"). Or whatever. I'm certainly not saying this makes sense from the point of view of good governance; I don't think it does. But refusing to hold hearings on the Garland nomination doesn't seem to me to do so either, so there you go. Scenario #2: Republicans lose the Senate (probability = ca. 0.25), but they still use filibuster shenanigans to keep the nomination from coming to a vote until they get someone to the right of Garland (probability = 0.10). Sure, a Democratically controlled Senate could change the filibuster rules, but at a cost[c], a cost Democrats might not want to pay. At the moment that looks to me like 0.50 x ([0.75 x 0.30] + [0.25 x 0.10]), which we could round up to 13%. Since I also believe that there's a roughly similar calculation that Republican Senators are likely to make between now and the election (discussed elsewhere), I'll double my estimation of the likelihood that Garland will be approved before President Obama leaves office. 26% is still rather unlikely, but it's not as low as one might think if one only listened to Republican Senators or as high as one might believe if one only listens to Harry Reid.   -- [a] http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/trackers/2016-03-16/-no-question-mcconnell-will-cave-on-garland-nomination-reid (h/t @austerity) [b] http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-could-do-a-lot-worse-than-merrick-garland-under-president-clinton-or-president-trump/ [c] http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2013/12/13/250805071/cost-of-battling-filibuster-rules-no-sleep-or-fund-raising [d] http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/25/opinion/the-party-of-no-way.html"], [52, "2016-03-17T23:30:20Z", [0.5], ""], [241, "2016-03-17T23:11:07Z", [0.35], ""], [12879, "2016-03-17T21:34:56Z", [0.1], ""], [21, "2016-03-17T21:07:27Z", [0.42], "If Cruz, Rubio, Kasich was likely nominee - Republican game plan would look better.

But I find it very hard to believe that Senate republicans consider this a strong probability at this time.  Most republicans consider Clinton to be beatable, even with Trump as nominee.  The polls are still pretty close.  And I could easily argue the other side, that with a republican president and majority senate (a distinct possibility), they can run the table and put in someone even more conservative than Scalia.  \n2)  The Senate has made it very clear they are arguing precedent here, not the choice in particular.  They could back down, but seriously now, how many times has a republican senate relented to Obama of all people?  \n3)  I am not buying the fact that Senate republicans are concerned about how this will affect their chances of getting re-elected.  A significant majority of republicans believe that Obama is a socialist that needs to be stopped at all costs.  Show me how many republicans have lost their jobs by being obstructionist?  In contrast, I can count many congressmen and senators that have lost their jobs because they have been branded as sell-outs.   I will happily reconsider if we see the following conditions:\n1)  We see the senate judiciary committee agree to nomination hearings.  As of now, none are to be schedule because \"it would send the wrong message.\"\n2)  The polls indicate that Hillary will destroy Trump in the election.  Thus far, admittedly early days, the polls are much closer than that.  \n3)  Along with that, the senate looks to be lost to republicans, especially if there is strong possibility of a veto-proof majority.

Mar 11: \"White House narrows search to three for Supreme Court\" --> http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-obama-idUSKCN0WD2LE The White House has narrowed its search for a Supreme Court nominee to three federal appeals court judges, Sri Srinivasan, Merrick Garland and Paul Watford, a source familiar with the selection process said on Friday. Srinivasan, an Indian-American who served under presidents of both parties before President Barack Obama named him as an appellate judge, and Garland, considered but passed over for the Supreme Court twice before by Obama, are considered the leading contenders, according to the source and two other sources close to the process.\n[...]\nSrinivasan, 49, and Garland, 63, serve together on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. That appeals court has served as a springboard to the Supreme Court for several justices including Scalia in recent decades. Srinivasan, who was born in India and grew up in Kansas, would be the first Asian-American and first Hindu on the high court. Obama appointed him to the appeals court in 2013. The Senate confirmed him in a 97-0 vote. Srinivasan served in the Justice Department under Democratic and Republican presidents and worked as a clerk to the first woman to serve on the Supreme Court, Sandra Day O'Connor, a Republican appointee.\n[...]\nWatford, 48, is a judge on the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, winning Senate confirmation in a 61-34 vote in 2012.

Let's start by breaking this problem into three interrelated questions: (Q1) Will President Obama nominate someone to replace recently deceased Justice Antonin Scalia?\n(Q2) What sort of nominee will President Obama nominate (if he nominates anyone)?\n(Q3) Will the Senate approve President Obama's nominee? Under ordinary conditions, I'd assign something approaching a 0.95 probability to a positive answer to Q1. Since 1900, there have been 20 U.S. presidents, and on eight occasions Supreme Court Justices have been nominated during a president's final year in office[1]. So this seems like a pretty routine response to the death of a Supreme Court Justice. Hence, nominations are pretty routine, even if some members of the party that is out of the executive office don't like them (understandably so). But these are not ordinary conditions. Republicans control the U.S. Senate, and they are having none of it: \"Regardless of what some are willing to admit publicly, everybody knows any nominee submitted in the middle of this presidential campaign isn\u2019t getting confirmed. Everybody. The White House knows it. Senate Democrats know it. Republicans know it. Even the press knows it,\" Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said at a committee meeting Thursday.[3]\nIt's slightly difficult to parse what Senator Grassley says. One admits only what one believes to be true. I cannot admit, for example, that 2 + 2 = 5 or that the color blue smells sour precisely because I believe neither of these things. So Senator Grassley might have made a Freudian slip here, or he might have less command over the English language than one would expect of an official elected to high office. Either way, the point is clear enough: Many Senate Republicans claim that they won't confirm someone whom President Obama nominates to fill the open seats on the Supreme Court. Indeed, Senate Republicans maintain that they won't even hold hearings on this topic. \"I don't know how many times we need to keep saying this: The Judiciary Committee has unanimously recommended to me that there be no hearing. I've said repeatedly and I'm now confident that my conference agrees that this decision ought to be made by the next president, whoever is elected,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday.[3] Notice the phrase, \"I don't know how many times we need to keep saying this.\" Doth the lady protest too much? When mom and dad tell you they're not going to repeat themselves again, it often means they're pretty close to breaking, but more about that later. The point for now is that the answer to Q3 has some relevance for the answer to Q1.  Is it actually true that \"any nominee submitted in the middle of this presidential campaign isn\u2019t getting confirmed\"? Well, no. I assume Senate Republicans would happily confirm Antonin Scalia's reanimated corpse - or anyone else with Scalia-style bona fides, however unlikely (probability = exactly 0.000000001 ) it is that President Obama would nominate someone like this. Moving back into the realm of practical possibility, there could be some incentive for Senate Republicans to hold hearings and even to confirm a nominee. Hear me out: There will 24 Republican Senate up for election in 2016[4], and Republicans can lose no more than 4 of these seats without ceding control of the Senate. (I'm simplifying, of course. This assumes that the Democrats don't lose any seats and that all of the nonsense about the vice-president casting the deciding vote in a tie doesn't come into play. And don't get me started on the filibuster rules.) There are 8 Senate seats currently held by Republicans which have been identified as the most likely to be flipped. These are in Arizona, North Carolina, Ohio, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Florida, Wisconsin, and Illinois[5]. If refusing to hold hearings or refusing to approve a Supreme Court nominee turned out to imperil candidates in these states, the Republican Senate leadership might decide to reverse itself. And there's good reason to think that a majority of the electorate disapproves of the Senate Republicans shenanigans[6]. Moreover, Senate states are decided in state-wide elections, so Senators can't hide in safe districts where GOP shilly shallying is popular. I think it's pretty clear that the leadership is trying to avoid this possibility now by publicly committing to a different strategy, and many have already noted the game-theoryish aspects of doing so[7]. All of this shows that the answer to Q2 has some relevance to Q3. So it's all a bit of a mess.  I've already said that under normal circumstances, I'd assign a probability of 0.95 to President Obama's nominating a Supreme Court Justice. I don't see any factors pushing that probability up (to put it mildly), but there are these factors that might push it down: Point 1: The high costs to the Obama administration (in terms of the amount of energy that it would have to direct toward this task) with low expected benefits. \nPoint 2: The high costs to the nominee (in terms of public scrutiny, personal attacks, invasion of privacy, etc.) with low expected benefits. \nPoint 3: The medium costs to the Democratic presidential candidate (96% likelihood = HRC) who would be dragged into the debate in ways that might mobilize Evangelicals and others who strongly oppose most (if not all) forms of legal abortion, etc. and might push her to commit to nominating only Supreme Court Justice (or other federal judges) who are more acceptable to Republicans elites.  As far as point 1 goes, the Obama administration has rather little it can do to affect domestic affairs at this point, at least through the usual routes. \"Few if any of the domestic policy proposals President Obama talked about in his sixth State of the Union speech stand much chance of landing on his desk to be signed into law\"[8]. So the opportunity cost of moving forward with the process is fairly low. What else is he going to do on the domestic front? Let's drop the probability by 0.1.  Regarding point 2, I'm sure that stepping into what is likely to be a bloody war with limited chances of success will dissuade many potentially strong nominees. But President Obama doesn't need many; he needs 1. And I'll bet he can find at least 1 - especially since there are likely to be some benefits to stepping into the role of potential sacrificial lamb. (I know I'm mixing my metaphors badly, but I just can't help it.) Even if the nominee is unsuccessful (as seems probable), he or she might receive the promise of a plum job in the next Democratic presidential administration or something similar at the state level. Only a 0.01 drop in probability then. Finally, on point 3 I'm not quite sure what to say. I have no idea what President Obama and HRC think of one another, and I don't think it matters. President Obama wants HRC to be elected in order to protect his legacy, especially the Affordable Care Act. That's incentive enough to be careful about his own actions that might (or might not) affect this fall's outcome. At this point, though, I'm only concerned with the question of whether nominating someone is likely, and the mere fact that someone is nominated is unlikely to have a a dramatic affect one way or another. Hell, having the Republican Senate to run against could be quite a boon for the Democratic presidential candidate, since 79% of Americans already disapprove of the way this lot's been carrying on[9]. I'm inclined to call this a wash. (Crap. Maybe all of this is moot, as this bit of news was just published: \"President Barack Obama on Thursday signaled that his announcement of a Supreme Court nominee could come soon, saying the nation\u2019s highest court needs to operate at full strength\"[10]. If so. I'll fix it later.) So that leaves me with a 0.84 probability that President Obama will nominate someone to fill the vacancy left by Justice Scalia's death. Clearly, if President Obama does not nominate someone (probability = 0.16), there is of course no chance that someone will be appointed. So we've got a conditional probability on ours hands. What remains to be determined is the probability that someone will be nominated, given that President Obama nominates someone. And that depends on who is nominated. So what sort of candidate will President Obama nominate? I'm really only interested in 1 variable here, crude as that sounds. The variable in question is, roughly speaking, how close to, or far away from, the political mainstream of the current U.S. electorate the candidate appears to be. I guess it wouldn't be totally misleading to think of this in terms of relative proximity of the nominee to the current U.S. median voter, though nothing I say here will rely too heavily on this particular conceptualization[11]. And to make matters even simpler (and even rougher around the edges), I'll assume there are only 3 mutually exclusive and mutually exhaustive states of affairs possible: State 1: The nominee's views are quite similar to that of the median voter.\nState 2: The nominee's views are moderately to the left of that of the median voter.\nState 3: The nominee's views are strongly to the left of to that of the median voter. Let's ignore the fact that being strongly to the left of that of the median voter doesn't mean being strongly to the left in any objective sense, whatever that means. The median voter in the U.S. is already party far too the right, historically and internationally speaking[12]. Anyway, there is some pressure on President Obama to nominate someone who would fit into state 3[13]. But the likelihood that President Obama would nominate anyone who fits into State 3 is very low (about 0.05), since doing so would all but guarantee that the nominee wouldn't be approved by the Senate and would also probably help the Republican presidential candidate in the fall by giving He Who Must Not Be Named a clear example of the kind of person that a Democratic president will foist on the poor, unsuspecting public in the near future, should she win the election. So it seems much more reasonable to think that President Obama will nominate someone who fits into State 1 or State 2. And there's an interesting tradeoff since a State 1 candidate is much more likely to be approved by the Senate but much more likely to upset Democrats and perhaps even alienate them on election day. Two oft-named possibilities who fit into State 1 (according to me, until I change my mind) are Merrick Garland and Sri Srinivasan, both of whom have as good a chance as anyone of getting the nod from the Senate[14]. I think Paul Watford counts as someone closer to fitting into state 2 - or would at least be seen to be so in virtue of serving on the 9th Circuit Court. On the basis of little more than a cursory inspection of the names that are being floated, I think that President Obama is about twice as likely to pick someone who fits into State 1 rather than State 2. That means, loosely, a probability of 0.60 of a nomination of a candidate who fits into State 1, and a 0.35 chance of a nomination of a candidate who fits into State 2.  And what about the probability that the Republican Senate will confirm nominees from these groups? It's hard to take much of an outside view. Of the 8 judicial nominees who came before the Senate during the last year of a presidential election, 6 were confirmed. That's a surprisingly low number, but the sample size is too small to be helpful, I believe. Now, something really crazy would have to happen in order for anyone who fits into State 3. Call this a probability of 0.01. But there is a far higher likelihood that Senate Republicans would (after much hemming and hawing) approve a nominee who fit into State 1. Part of the explanation was already mentioned above: Republicans might have to compromise to increase the likelihood that enough Senators from their party get re-elected to maintain control of the institution for their party. The other explanation is that Republicans might come to think that they are better off getting a sure thing (with a nominee who fits into State 1) than taking a chance that a Democrat will be elected president in the fall and will nominate someone who falls into State 2 or State 3[15]. For the moment, let's call the probability of this event 0.25, though it's likely to go up or down given who the Republicans end up nominating as a presidential candidate or how the general election appears to be progressing. Finally, these same explanation hold, though to a lesser extent, for a nominee who fits into State 2. Blocking a nominee of this sort is less likely to generate pressure on Republican Senatorial incumbents, and a nominee in this state is closer (but not all of the way over to) the worst-case scenario of Republicans. Still, Senate Republican leadership might still determine that it's better to be shot in the leg than take a chance with being shot in the head. Call the probability of this event 0.10.  At last, we're at a point where we can do the (fairly simple) calculation: (0.16)*(0) + (0.84)[(0.60)*(0.25)+(0.35)*(0.10)+(0.05)*(0.01)] = about 0.16. And there we have it. At the moment, there is a 16% chance that a new Supreme Court Justice will be approved, though this probability will go up to 25% immediately if President Obama nominates someone like Sri Srinivasan. --- [1] http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/11/us/politics/senate-judiciary-committee-supreme-court-nominee.html [2] http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/03/10/gop-betraying-constitution-supreme-court-nomination-fight-obama-says/81581210/ [3] http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/23/politics/joe-biden-supreme-court-senate-republicans/ [4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_elections,_2016 [5] https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/10-senate-races-most-likely-to-switch-parties-in-2016-elections/2015/06/07/d9215fbc-0d13-11e5-9726-49d6fa26a8c6_story.html [6] http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-03-09/poll-majority-oppose-gops-plan-to-block-obamas-supreme-court-nominee - here it is in a little more detail: 53% approve, 34% disapprove - according to a YouGov poll.

Mar 10: \"Report: This Judge Has More than 50% Chance of Being Picked For Supreme Court\" --> http://lawnewz.com/high-profile/sources-say-this-judge-has-more-than-50-chance-of-being-picked-for-supreme-court/ President Obama is expected to announce his Supreme Court nominee as early as next Wednesday, according to a Washington Examiner report. Their source indicates that the President\u2019s short list is down to five, with one front-runner leading the pack. The rumored candidates are Chief Judge Merrick Garland and Judge Sri Srinivasan of the D.C. Court of Appeals, D.C. District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, 8th Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Jane Kelly, 9th Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Paul Watford. The source believes that Judge Srinivasan is the favorite, with a greater than 50 percent chance of being nominated. He would be the first ever Asian American to serve on the nation\u2019s highest court. Reuters also reported that these five judges are the only ones under consideration, according to their source. White House officials are not confirming any rumors, and spokesperson Josh Earnest told a reporter that he was not in a position to confirm whether any individuals are under consideration. When asked about Garland, Kelly, and Srinivasan, he simply said those three \u201care people that the president was proud to have appointed to the federal bench.\u201d ~~~ COMMENT: So, it looks like it might not be Kelly (and the Iowa connection). From what I've read, Srinivasan is an equally formidable candidate who has strong bona fides and was confirmed in the Senate recently (for a different judicial appointment). Even after I've settled on Trump as the nominee, I still don't see the GOP capitulating and confirming an Obama nominee not just because they've said they won't, but because this is an issue that is of paramount importance to the GOP's base.  I'd be VERY interested to hear word from those folks who are pulling the consensus of this IFP (up, up, and away!) as to why they think that the GOP will cave and then CONFIRM an Obama nominee. ****\n****\nEDIT: A little bit after posting this, I came across this: Mar 10: \"GOP Senator Admits SCOTUS Obstruction Wouldn\u2019t Happen If Obama Were Republican\" --> http://www.mediaite.com/online/gop-senator-admits-scotus-obstruction-wouldnt-happen-if-obama-were-republican/ During a discussion with Wisconsin radio\u2019s Morning Mess, Republican Senator Ron Johnson got candid today while assessing the war for the Supreme Court between President Obama and the GOP-controlled Senate. Ever since Antonin Scalia\u2018s death, the Judiciary Committee and other Congressional leaders vowed to flat-out refuse to consider any replacement nominated by Obama. Johnson was asked about this obstructionist movement, and when he brought up an election year nominee from a hypothetical president Mitt Romney, he admitted that that would\u2019ve been quite a different situation. \u201cGenerally, if a conservative president\u2019s replacing a conservative justice, there\u2019s a little more accommodation to it,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s under any illusion President Obama\u2019s nominee would flip the court from a 5-4 conservative to a 5-4 liberal controlled court.\u201d Johnson continued to express that such a moment would drastically threaten religious freedoms and the right to bear arms, and that the most reasonable thing to do was to wait and \u201clet the American people decide.\u201d ~~~~ COMMENT: Take from this what you will..."], [142, "2016-03-10T18:57:52Z", [0.65], "A year is a long time to wait, many things can change.

Why?   A)  It's an anti-establishment year and Grassley's been in the senate FOREVER.

The GOP are the most intransigent major party of any western nation. Full stop. The *only* way they back off of their hard stance is if they get something in return. Nix that. The only way they back off their hard stance is if they get EVERYTHING they want in return.

Give up? OK. Patty Judge is running for a Senate seat in... Iowa! Who's up for re-election in Iowa? Chuck Grassley! Who's Chuck Grassley? The Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee! Why is this important? (and why do I keep asking questions and then answering myself?) There are two key figures within the GOP for this SCOTUS *battle*: Mitch McConnell, GOP Leader in the Senate (i.e. the guy who will say yay/nay to allowing the Senate to hold a confirmation hearing for a SCOTUS nominee) and Chuck Grassley, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee (i.e. the guy who has to allow his committee to FIRST review the SCOTUS nominee). That's right, before the Senate as a whole reviews the nominee, the Judiciary Committee reviews it. So... why is this important? Well, recently we learned (https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/156987) that Obama was considering putting up someone who made a name for herself in Iowa. It's not clear -- for sure -- whether this is who the nominee will be, but if it is (and it might be starting to look like that given how the course of events are playing out), then Sen. Chuck Grassley might be starting to have a very different opinion as to whether he wants the Judiciary Committee to review the SCOTUS nominee. **** TL;DR -- Democrat is challenging for a GOP Senate seat in Iowa held by the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The nominee looks like it might be someone from Iowa, which will put pressure on the Chairman to remain steadfast in his intransigence and possibly (probably?) lose his Senate seat or allow the committee to review the nominee."], [16272, "2016-03-04T18:46:19Z", [0.85], ""], [19829, "2016-03-04T18:08:22Z", [0.6], ""], [67, "2016-03-04T17:20:37Z", [0.61], "The Republicans have the ability to block the nominee.

A pool of these potential candidates can be found among the appellate court judges who were nominated by Mr. Obama or President Bill Clinton and confirmed with some Republican ayes. Possible choices are Merrick B. Garland of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, who was confirmed in 1997 with 32 Republicans voting in favor, and Jane L. Kelly of the Eighth Circuit, who was confirmed, 96 to 0, in 2013. Such a nomination might split the Republicans more than it energizes the Democrats. Judge Kelly, for instance, is a former Iowa public defender who drew support in 2013 from her state\u2019s senior Republican senator, Charles E. Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Mr. Grassley said on Tuesday that he would not rule out a committee hearing on Mr. Obama\u2019s nominee, an apparent shift from his earlier statement that the next president should fill the vacancy. Judge Garland is from Illinois, the home state of Mr. Kirk. Some Republican senators have a history of supporting Democratic nominees who are widely regarded as reasonable choices. If Senate Republicans do end up fracturing, with some open to the nominee and others opposed, the Republican presidential candidates are sure to react with fury because they are counting on a united and energized party come November. Conservative voters, in turn, could end up disheartened if they think Republicans in Washington are giving into Mr. Obama. While such divisions would delight Democrats, their party\u2019s activist wing may be underwhelmed by a nominee who is an apparent moderate or who does not make history. The last white man who was nominated to the court by a Democratic president was Stephen G. Breyer in 1994. ~~~~ COMMENT: The interesting part here is the 'fracturing' of the GOP. From a \"Democrat\" standpoint, the GOP appearing to be in 'disarray,' might be best for their electoral chances, so it would make sense that Obama might go this route, if even as a backdoor option to try and get somebody confirmed in those first two weeks in January (if the GOP win the WH, but lose the Senate)."], [484, "2016-03-03T05:35:00Z", [0.35], "Up 10% on @GJDrew (and at least one other) find."], [10898, "2016-03-03T05:17:59Z", [0.22], ""], [102, "2016-03-03T05:16:22Z", [0.28], ""], [2, "2016-03-03T05:03:09Z", [0.55], "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/03/us/politics/white-house-vetting-jane-kelly-judge-supreme-court.html I think Jane Kelly is a very good pick.

Forecaster \"see\" made a very good point about the majority in the Senate.  Generally speaking, he noted that if the Senate was majority democrat as of January 5th, there would theoretically be enough time to squeak in a nominee for the supreme court.  I really appreciate this angle, as this kind of timing often provides excellent value in terms of forecasting accuracy.  But...  I think its important to note that a mere majority of democrats will not be enough to do it.  The majority would have to be filibuster-proof, which is approximately 60 senators.  Right now, we have 54 republican senators, 45 democrats, and 1 independent.  There are 34 seats up for election in 2016, so there is a theoretical chance that we could see as swing of 24 seats.  But is that probable?  According the the analysis below, most of the seats in contention are relatively safe seats for the Republicans, which seems superficially a reasonable estimation, given the vast majority are in the south, Texas, Arizona, and the deep midwest.  This analysis basically says we have 9 seats that are borderline.  If all these go to the democrats, they still do not have enough for a filibuster-proof senate.  But I have to admit that if we have a Clinton land-slide (improbable per the polls), we could see some kind of wipe-out for republican senators, and the democrats might find some way to rush through someone.  I would point out that if we really wanted to believe this would work, we should then consider the operational aspects of how long it takes for a senator to formally assume his position.  But given the small chance of a democratic nation-wide land-slide, I am currently raising my probability a bit.  I am prepared to raise it even further, if the polls on the presidential and senate races show a democratic land-slide in the making. Below are some numbers on the senate race, along with analysis of which seats are contested and which are safe:\nhttp://www.270towin.com/2016-senate-election/ Below are the rules pertinent to the so-called nuclear option, which states that it applies to appointees EXCEPT supreme court justices.  So no relief there.  \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_option What about Grassley, et. al. changing their position on the nomination based on some game dynamic, such as being presented with a moderate republican nominee?  Because if Obama decides to float a super-liberal progressive to make a point, ALL IS LOST, zero probability.  Something to keep in mind I think.  While the concept will be tempting to a few republican senators, I think the republicans have a pretty simple game dynamic that screams they should remain obstructionist.  Given the republicans believe they have lost their most conservative justice, they naturally want someone just as extreme to replace.  Obama will never appoint such a person.  If the senate waits, two things can happen.  They get Clinton, who will probably still put up a relatively mild liberal (in my opinion based on democrats not controlling the senate with a filibuster-proof majority).  Or the republicans get Trump (or whoever) who would put up anyone the conservative movement wants.  So why not just wait?   In my opinion, shaming will not work because all that does is break things down by party lines.  Republicans will be in favor of waiting and Democrats will think its obnoxious.  I did see an article indicating that republican senators who are up for election are strongly in favor of waiting.  So no help there.   Now I will say that I think if we see Clinton doing very well in the polls, which has not happened yet, we should revisit this dynamic.  Because maybe if the senate republicans see themselves losing the presidency, they might want to cut their losses on the appointment while they still can.  I would note that the senate and presidential races are synergistic.  So if Clinton is likely to win quite solidly solidly, its likely the Senate races will predominately go against the republicans as well. Then Clinton could put Bernie Sanders on the court.

Without being too repetitive, essentially, Obama could either go very liberal or moderate with his nomination and that might change how the GOP react (I suspect they're intransigent either way). The big wildcard here is the election (obviously). If things start to look bad for the GOP (i.e. confirmation that Trump will be the nominee?), then maybe the GOP decide to ease back on their intransigence, but the past seems to indicate that won't be the case. And more than that, from what I remember about reading polls/data of the US electorate, (one of) the reasons there has been such partisanship during the Obama administration is because GOP voters WANT their politicians to be stubborn, er, uncompromising, er, to be honest, I forgot the adjective, but essentially, their voters don't want them to capitulate. However, Democrat/Independent voters DO want their politicians to compromise (that's why there were such craziness -- remember the \"debt ceiling\" and the \"fiscal cliff\" shenanigans?). So, keeping that in mind and moving forward through April, May, June, it might be that the GOP would rather have a say with an Obama nominee than have to contend with a Trump nominee. But, there is the possibility (probability?) that if Trump's the nominee, the Democrats will retake the Senate, which would usurp the GOP of their plan to wait until there's a new President to confirm a nominee, which might mean that they'll try and confirm someone in December (can't rule anything out in this crazy year of politics).  Lastly, and this is the point that @see made, it's possible that the Dem's win the Senate (but not the WH) and try and confirm someone before inauguration day in January (the Senate's term starts on Jan 1, so they can technically open for business and jam a nominee through right there). I mean, that'll be quite a story if that's what comes to pass, but these are some of the things that are keeping me away from 0% on this IFP (for now).\n~~~~ The big things to watch for next: \n*who is Obama's nominee (very liberal or moderate?)\n*Is Trump on track to become nominee?\n*Early polling for competitive Senate races"], [15443, "2016-03-02T04:47:49Z", [0.63], ""], [5863, "2016-03-02T04:44:11Z", [0.55], ""], [691, "2016-03-02T04:12:35Z", [0.06], "The President has said he will send over a name.

It seems all but certain (> 95%) that Obama will nominate a candidate to the Supreme Court, as he has publically committed to doing so on a number of occasions.  (2) If a candidate is nominated, will the Senate consider said candidate prior to January 2017? Since 1789, it has taken an average of 25 days to reach a final result after a candidate has been nominated (and never more than 125 days). In more recent history (1981-2016), it has taken slightly longer\u2014an average of 67 days between nomination and ultimate result (withdrawal, rejection, or successful appointment). While the historical record suggests that Obama\u2019s nominee will at least get considered by the Senate, the current Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, has said the Republican-controlled Senate will not consider any nomination made. So long as this remains the position of Republican senators, there is really nothing the Democrats can do to force their hand. The only tool they have at their disposal is political pressure. Given the current level of polarization in the Senate, I would put the chance of Democrats pressuring Republicans into conducting a vote as 50/50 at best.   (3) If they proceed with a vote, will the Senate approve the nominee? The baseline rate for successful Supreme Court nominations is quite high. Since 1789, the Senate has approved 142 nominations to the court out of a total of 160 (a 77.5% success rate). And this high success rate even persists during election years. Since 1900, the Senate has approved 6 of the 8 Supreme Court justices voted on during an election year (a 75% success rate).  Given the current level or polarization and the current stance of the Republican senators, I would put the chances of approval as somewhat less than the baseline, say around 40% or so (though this will depend on the who the nominee ultimately is).  Taken together, the probability of these three sequential events occurring (95% x 50% x 40%) suggests the overall probability of a new Supreme Court Justice being appointed before January 2017 is 20% or so.  Updating strategy:  (A) The nominee put forth by Obama will have a large impact on this question. If Obama chooses to nominate a very liberal judge, the chances of a successful nomination drop to zero. If Obama chooses a more moderate or conservative leaning judge, the chances of a successful nomination go up.\n(B) If it looks like the Democrats will take the Presidency again in 2016 (which seems to be the way things are leaning at the moment), Senate Republicans may be willing to compromise on a moderate candidate. It will be important to track their shifting stances as the race plays out.

In this case, I do not think that past confirmation likelihoods are as relevant because of the circumstances (otherwise, my estimate would be far higher). Here, because the appointment is contingent on presidential nomination, Senate judiciary committee recommendation, and full Senate approval, there are several key players involved and many strategic positions to consider. The first is President Obama, who has said that he will nominate someone to fill the Court's vacancy. As a political move, it may be best for him to nominate someone who he knows may not get approved so that it doesn't hurt the chances of someone who could actually get approved if nominated by the next president. It seems from the media and from statements made by Obama that he is resolute to nominate someone qualified; but beyond that, the power rests in the hands of members of the Senate and potential the presidential candidates. For these reasons, I will continue to update as the presidential election unfolds and once he nominates someone, to account for how qualified or controversial they are.  Chuck Grassley (R, Iowa) is the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He has made a public statement  that he will not hold hearing to consider any appointment by President Obama. Right now, this presents a major block to someone being appointed. However, while he has the political luxury to take this stance now, as the presidential election continues as the future composition of the White House and Senate become clearer, it may indeed be more advantageous for Grassley to hold hearings on an Obama nomination before a potential Democratic stronghold on the Senate and presidency. I will update this as the presidential contest develops.  Second, Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) is the majority leader of the Senate, who has made public statements against taking a vote on any of Obama's appointments. This leads me, again, to believe that there is only a small chance of appointment, especially because an overwhelming majority of Republican senators have fallen in line with his position. However, there are various political pressures. I will continue to update as the presidential race evolves.

I am tempted to say that past SC nominations / approval rate do not matter very much.  We have a two fairly well-defined sides here and a rather unusual mood in the american electorate, so I think game-theory strategy + likely public reaction is probably going to be more reliable than going off the base rate here (which I think is extremely high?  like presidents nearly always or always get someone approved?). Instead, I'm going to take this sequentially.  It is quite predictable how this will go in the short term, and gets harder to predict several months out. 1) R's have made the first move here - laying down on the tracks to say they won't even consider a nominee (current status quo described here: http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/01/politics/obama-mitch-mcconnell-supreme-court-nomination/index.html).  I have argued on Twitter & elsewhere this is probably a pretty strong strategy, as it makes it more likely the president will choose a less controversial / more moderate nominee, which would then provide them with free option value later to either continue to deny or approve based on i) how presidential race is looking; ii) public reaction. 2) Obama will name a nominee in March.  He is surely vetting candidates and he won't want to wait too long.  There are two paths he could take, fairly well laid out by the SCOTUSBlog folks:\n  2a) Name a moderate who has been approved by senate before (Sri Srinivasan or someone else).  Make case to the electorate that Republicans are totally unreasonable/obstructionist.\n  2b) Recognize the republicans are not going to approve anyone anyways, and instead name a liberal specifically targeted to engage & energize a certain demographic of voters (Ketanji Jackson has been mentioned as an African American woman.  Jacquelin Nguyen has made some international press / gotten recognition in Asian American community). Which way he goes here may tell us something about likelihood for this qn.  If candidate seems very moderate or even w/ some Republican credentials, it's clear he's hoping to force a vote.  If he puts up someone quite liberal, I think energizing the base is his strategy and getting to an actual vote on the person is presumably then much less likely.  For what it's worth, I believe he'll go with a, and I'd put my confidence interval on that at ~90%.  A strong liberal being nominated will energize the Republican base at least as much if not more than Democratic, whereas a moderate many Republicans should be able to get behind will reinforce the message many Americans already believe - the current GOP is hopelessly broken and unable to govern. c) Assuming he nominates a moderate, it is now April, and we have to ask ourselves, what happens next?  Republicans certainly keep up the facade of #nohearingsnovotes, at least initially.  Democrats, meanwhile, take the case to the electorate that the Republicans in the senate are hopelessly obstructionist and are leaving the supreme court down a member for ~1 yr for no reason and with no precedent in the past (i.e. in past, usually there can be a compromise and someone gets on).   There are 24 incumbent Republican seats up in 2016 (incl. Grassley in IA), as well as obviously the Presidency.  I believe whether or not the Republicans blink and agree to hearings or a vote is going to depend on the state of those races and the public reaction to their strategy.  This seems to me to be where the question becomes quite difficult to handicap - who knows how that die will fall.  Will there be revelations about the nominee that make person look unfit?  Maybe an R email or off-mic comment gets leaked that makes them look unduly obstructionist.  Could there be a deal to be struck?  Who knows.  At the highest level, I'd be quite surprised if this issue swayed which candidate very many Americans supported (i.e. democrats will say R's should confirm, R's will be happy their guys are holding it up).  Given that dynamic, I'm coming down on the unlikely side here (I'd say 2 out of 3 no, but to be frank, I really don't know). To summarize then:\n10% chance Obama nominates a v strong liberal and makes fight about energizing respective bases vs. actually bringing someone to a vote\n90% chance of a moderate nominee.  2/3 it doesn't hurt the Republicans to stonewall anyways, 1/3 they change tack as a result of public opinion / state of the races (30% overall).\n"], [915, "2016-03-01T18:57:16Z", [0.0], ""], [2, "2016-03-01T18:55:16Z", [0.25], ""], [2, "2016-03-01T18:54:13Z", [0.15], "Best chance is to nominate a republican, e.g. Brian Sandoval, or a sitting senator.
