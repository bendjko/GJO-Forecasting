I haven't found any indication that either Delaware or Pennsylvania show any inclination to take the next step. The auto industry have been lobbying fairly aggressively against these laws (this was just when NH thought about following the LEV program https://www.nh.gov/oep/energy/programs/documents/sb191pc-2014-7-8-alliance-automobile-manufacturers.pdf), and it seems that they will struggle to meet the demands of the mandate as is, without adding more states. Finally there is the argument about giving up sovereignty to California lawmakers, which in an election year is probably an argument that no-one wants to have.

States can support ZEV vehicles by tax credits/rebates, etc without having to participate in the California ZEV program.  Extract: http://cleantechnica.com/2015/06/06/why-california-gets-electric-cars-other-zev-mandate-states-dont-get/\nThe California Air Resource Board has mandated that automakers produce a certain number of zero-emissions vehicles (ZEVs), and 9 other states, most of them in the Northeast, have adopted those same standards. So why are there so many more electric and hydrogen vehicles for sale in California than the 9 other states that follow the same ZEV mandate? Green Car Reports did some digging and came across an obscure \u201ctravel provision\u201d rule that allows any earned ZEV credits in any of these states to be counted towards the mandate in any of the other states. Since California is the biggest state out of all the states to follow these stricter mandates, automakers can simply sell enough ZEVs in the Golden State to meet their obligations in the other 9 states. This means California ZEV credits count towards the credit requirements in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Vermont. That\u2019s one helluva loophole, and one that won\u2019t be open for much longer. At the END OF 2017, this EXEMPTION SHOULD CLOSE, meaning automakers will have to meet ZEV quotas in individual states, rather than just piling onto California.

The program will include increasingly onerous quotas on car sales over the next decade. This is a government mandate to make a specific type of product that consumer demand will not adequately support. A ZEV mandate is not necessary to support strong sales of electric cars. Other policies, such as incentives or allowing electric vehicles to access high-occupancy vehicle lanes, will do more to increase ZEV adoption.

Yes, a couple of states are informally following the standards, but no evidence of definite plans to formally adopt.   As a practical matter, I wonder why a State would bother at this time.   Electric vehicles are experiencing very high sales growth, even with lower gas prices.  All the major automakers are soon to offer (or are offering) $30K range long range electric vehicles.  The economies of scale for lithium-ion batteries are getting quite compelling.  Here is an interesting article on this point:\nhttp://www.behindenergy.com/how-electric-cars-will-cause-the-next-oil-crisis/?lang=en This Mother Jones article is also instructive.  I think it looks at a very good point, which is now clean is the generation of the electricity used for most ZEVs?  One would then think that a focus on renewable energy sources would be more worthwhile than on ZEVs, with that in mind.  \nhttp://www.motherjones.com/blue-marble/2016/02/electric-vehicles-oil-prices I put this in the same category as solar panel incentives, which are now going away.  Its tough to fight for subsidies or incentives for a given activity, if the economics are already getting increasingly favorable, and the volume is beginning to adversely affect powerful interests.  I also find the PZEV argument compelling, which is that this is an area that could be encouraged instead of ZEVs.  If a state wanted to incent, why not focus on designations that are less restrictive than ZEV standards?   Now if ZEV sales began to fall off, maybe then we would see a revisit of imposing ZEV standards.
