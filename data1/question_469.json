Moshe Ya'alon, Israel's former minister of military affairs, said Netanyahu \u201cshould have resigned a while ago\u201d as a result of the ongoing criminal investigations against him, The Times of Israel reported.  \u201cThis is a matter of political culture, obviously, there is no smoke without fire,\u201d he said in remarks at a cultural event in the northern Israel city of Afula on Saturday. Under Israeli law, a prime minister does not need to step down if indicted and can continue to serve as premier during the duration of a trial. Ya'alon said in Israel \u201csomeone in the past gave himself immunity and passed legislation that a prime minister does not need to resign.\u201d The Israeli premier is under probe over charges that he had accepted highly-valued gifts lavished upon him by billionaires and entered a deal with the Yedioth Ahronoth paper ensuring more favorable coverage of his political career. Netanyahu\u2019s allies have said they would support him continuing to serve as prime minister even if either of the criminal investigations against him, which are known as Case 1000 and Case 2000, leads to an indictment. Case 1000 involves alleged illicit gifts given to Netanyahu and his family from billionaires, including Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan.  Most notably, the gifts include hundreds of thousands of shekels worth of cigars and champagne, which Netanyahu and his wife Sarah have played down as mere \u201ctrifles\u201d exchanged between close friends.

Dozens of cabinet ministers, Knesset members and mayors have also been the subject of graft investigations.  Netanyahu has been the subject of criminal investigations before.

Police then recommended charging Netanyahu, but prosecutors declined to file charges (para. 1-12). Press TV Website. (2017) Scandals part of 'political culture' in Israel: Ya'alon.

The statement, provided to Defense News by a senior official, represents a full reversal of the service\u2019s stance late last year, when officials said that they would prefer a standard multi-year bidding process.  Netanyahu's office negotiated the submarine deal with ThyssenKrupp directly, without input from the Navy and despite the objections of then-defense minister Moshe Yaalon. The abruptness of the arrangement \u2013 and the involvement of Netanyahu's personal lawyer, who had ties to a firm advising ThyssenKrupp in Israel \u2013 has raised questions of conflicts of interest, and the deal is now the subject of a criminal investigation. At Germany's insistence, both sides have recently agreed to add a clause to the submarine contract that would cancel the deal if the Israeli investigation finds evidence of corruption.  It is not the first time that ThyssenKrupp has found itself involved in a defense procurement scandal: it launched an internal investigation in 2015 when rumors emerged that subsidiary had bribed foreign government officials, and in 2016 German prosecutors searched its offices for evidence of suspected bribery at a joint venture, Atlas Elektronic. Neither is it the sole corruption investigation involving individuals close to Netanyahu. On Thursday, the prime minister's cousin gave testimony in an unrelated inquiry that seeks to determine whether Netanyahu accepted illegal gifts from businesses. Separately, prosecutors are reportedly nearing an indictment for Netanyahu\u2019s wife, Sara, who may soon face charges of \"fraudulent receiving\" for allegedly using state funds to decorate and maintain the family's private home.

Ahronheim (2017) April 18, states that: As the police continues to look into corruption charges relating to the submarine deal, the agreement between the two countries remains the subject of a heated debate.\nIn what may pose a significant setback for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel and Germany have agreed to cancel the deal to purchase submarines if corruption charges relating to the deal with German company ThyssenKrupp are substantiated by the police investigation. According to a report by Haaretz, the agreement was added at the insistence of the Germans as a new clause to a draft memorandum of understanding on the purchase, which is set to be signed within a few weeks.\nSenior officials in both countries have agreed that the agreement is a condition for Germany\u2019s agreement to sign the contract on the transaction. In addition to the significant sum of money that the deal is worth, senior German officials stated that the deal is important for German Chancellor Angela Merkel to show her \u201cexplicit policy of strengthening Israeli security.\u201d MK Erel Margalit (Zionist Union) responded to the report saying that \u201cthe prime minister is trying to snatch an advantage while under investigation at a price of 1.5 billion euros and Germany\u2019s demand of a corruption clause illustrates the gravity of the situation. \u201cI demand that the implementation of the agreement be delayed until the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee has discussed the deal in the presence of the prime minister,\u201d he added. Questions over the 2014 submarine deal began to arise in November when Channel 10 reported that Netanyahu\u2019s personal lawyer, David Shimron, worked for the Israeli representative of ThyssenKrupp (para. 1-8).
