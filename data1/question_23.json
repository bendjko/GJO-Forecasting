It shouldn't be that hard for PIS to break them apart and take over 14 or so MPs they need to rule independently of other parties. Kukiz may anticipate it, however being new in politics, quite inexperienced - and also a bit naive - he may still go for coalition with PIS.

But, I'm going to add an extra assumption that the undecided voters do not break that way, but rather break more toward the minor parties. Who knows!?! lol So close. Exciting.\n(Now here's the rub.

If you assume these votes will be allocated back according to the ratio of the parties that do qualify, then, with the addition of the undecided voters, PiS would get 40.47% and (using seat/% of 6) 243 seats, a majority. But, I'm also now thinking that at least half of the \"undecided\" group are actually going to be \"no shows\" instead. I can't read polish so I don't know the polling methodology. Long story short, accept the poll as it is, go majority. Believe undecideds may evidence peculiar behaviors, etc., go 50/50 maybe.] [Edit#2: Speaking polish would help. What I assumed was \"undecided\" is actually labeled as \"Others\" on the Wikipedia page, so my analysis pretty much falls apart. In the meantime, two different, newer, polls have been posted. One shows clear majority, one closer to 50/50. Rather than switch to 100% majority, which I should do, I'm going to hang my hat on the notion of people possibly \"voting tactically,\" which I recall some reference to in one of the earliest articles I read. I have no idea what voting tactically actually means, but I'm assuming that it is some method to vote in a concerted fashion to prevent any one party obtaining a majority.

Looking at the nationwide vote percentages won by the top two parties for each election from 1997-2011 and comparing that to the number of seats those parties they were allocated in the Sehm, I estimate that every percentage point a party receives in the national vote equals roughly 5.4 seats in the Sehm. That's just an average. The PiS once got 5.74 seats for each point it received in the national popular vote. Another party got as few as 5.04 seats for every percentage point.

First of all, in Poland seats are allocated according to D'Hondt method.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D'Hondt_method There are 460 seats in Poland's Sejm, so you (obviously) need 231 seats for Majority. Another - and MOST CRUCIAL - thing that we have to remember is that the election threshold in Poland in 5% This time everything depends on small parties - specifically whether or not they will cross the threshold. Currently there are 4 (!) parties that are on the verge of crossing the threshold and they account for MOST OF THE UNCERTAINTY in this question. Those parties are:\n- KORWiN - extreme laissez faire when it comes to economy, far right when it comes to politics\n- Kukiz's Movement - it's leader is a hell of a loose canon and at the same moment the only thing that keeps his 'party' in one piece.\n- NPL - PO (Civic Platform) offshoot - this is strictly political plot to get votes of people dissatisfied with PO, but who won't vote on other parties.\n- PSL - farmer's party, mostly interested in putting it's members and their relatives on well paid state sinecures and allocating as much money as they can on agricultural subsidies (they are farmers themselves after all...) Now, there is also SLD+TR lefty list, but they will most likely cross the threshold as they're the only left parties in Poland. Civic Platform itself is at stable 25% - that's their core electorate, so the support most likely will not fall below that. PIS support is at 38% and is not likely to change much in either way. NPL (and most likely SLD+TR) will ally with PO. Even if not, they WILL NOT form coalition with PIS. PSL will ally with whoever gives them better terms. KORWiN - most likely will stay in opposition, however alliance both with PO and PIS is possible, although highly unlikely. Kukiz - the same as above (KORWiN), however the alliance is even less likely. As far as the last two (KORWiN, Kukiz) are considered - the alliance may be formed, however it won't last long. Although this will satisfy question's resolution criteria. Possible scenarios. 1. If all of the small parties are left out - PIS will have majority. Highly unlikely 2. If one of the small parties gets in - PIS can steal a few of it's (or even PO!) MPs (Members of Parliament) to get majority. Even if this party is NPL, PIS may get away with getting majority. Still unlikely. 3. Two of the small parties get in - this scenario is quite possible. Now things start to get interesting.\nPIS will not have Majority. It will have to form coalition with one of the small parties.\nIf one of those parties is PSL, PIS will be good. However it will be for example NPL+Kukiz or NPL+KORWiN, then PIS will have a problem and will have to make sacrifices in order to reach compromise and form coalition. 4. Three of the small parties get in - also quite possible. Basically (because of D'Hondt method) not much changes for PIS, however more work will be needed to form coalition. Possibility of wide PO+NPL+SLD+TR+ someoneelse coalition becomes a possibility. 5. All of the small parties get in. Things turn ugly for PIS - and Poland as such government would not be stable, unless some shifts on the political scene are made (party merging etc.).\nPIS needs to get TWO small parties on board to form ruling coalition. Lots of sacrifices will have to be made.\nAt the same moment wide PO+someothers coalition looks increasingly more likely. Summary Probality of scenarion (from lowest to highest All of small left out.\nOne of the small gets in OR All of the small get in\nTwo of the small get in OR Three of the small get in. The most likely are 3rd ant 4th scenarios. Those indicate formation of coalition led by PIS, so PLU (plurality) outcome.\nRight after them are 2nd and 5th scenario. So still Plurality is most likely, with a small chance for MAJ and NON outcomes.\n1st scenario (MAJ) is highly unlikely (at THIS moment!). Considering all of the above I'm placing my bets at 27/63/10 (MAJ/PLU/NON). Will track opinion polls and update my forecast accordingly.

A plurality seems certain, and a majority also seems likely, provided there is no protest by voters regarding the general direction of PiS policy.\" There should be no question that PiS will reach a plurality in the Sejm next month. I will only add that the external driving geopolitical forces in this election are the fragmentation of EU policy on finances (e.g., Greek bailout) and military defense (e.g., disrepair of Germany's Luftwaffe).  PiS offers a break from these European policies in face of a vital Russian threat.  In general, the people of Poland wish for self-reliance.

The President's position is reportedly mostly ceremonial, except that it controls foreign policy.\n     The PO currently controls Parliament with 207 seats to 157 for PiS. The PO outlook is pro European, based on European defense strategies, which currently non greatly in favor of militarizing Poland against Russia.

The PiS is less interested in EU initiatives like renewable energy, when Poland has large amounts of coal, or social issues, than the PO position offers.\n     Parties are required to collect 5%, and coalitions 8%, of the vote to gain Parliamentary seats.

In the referendum, voters were asked to decide if they wanted to change the electoral system to introduce single- member districts in hopes of making the system less partisan; reduce state financing of political parties; and force courts to side with taxpayers when their disputes with tax authorities were in doubt. Voters approved the measures, but the referendum isn't binding because turnout was so low. An opinion poll by pollster Millward Brown published on Monday put conservative Law and Justice party in the lead ahead of the parliamentary election, with 38% support, while the ruling Civic Platform party would win 25%. Mr. Miller's left-leaning coalition would get 9% and some other small parties would also win seats. The poll showed the Law and Justice party would be only two seats short of a majority in the Sejm, lower house of parliament. . . . voters have shown fatigue not only with the eight-year-old ruling camp but also the long-established political parties that have governed the country since 1989.\n~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  This may be a silly way to look at it, but . . .
