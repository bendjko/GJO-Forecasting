It is unlikely that any NATO country would have the necessary capabilities to demand a war against Russia. As things stand, it is extremely unlikely that Russia will attack a NATO member state, as the Kremlin now prefers to attack Western countries in the cyber realm, through malware, disinformation campaigns, election meddling and so on.  Article 4 is the one that is more likely to be triggered (that article 5, that is). That is because of rising tensions among Russia and Western countries. At the moment, NATO suspended practical cooperation with Russia due to its aggressive actions in Ukraine, but channels for political dialogue are still open. The NATO-Russia Council, an important platform for dialogue, has not been suspended. Therefore, it seems like there is still will to maintain at the very least the status quo. There are currently no tensions on the Eastern border of NATO that could escalate to a threatening scenario. Many of my colleagues pointed out the fact that Turkey might be the member to take such a step. However, I believe it is unlikely iven its strategic position and the fact that Turkey-Russia relations have improved. Turkey is now basically playing both sides, by currently having military personnel in Russia learning how to operate the new surface-to-air missile system that it has just purchased from the Russians. While this is not a proof of hostility to the West, it is a realist position that secures the country's best interest.  Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said in a news conference: \"Our neighbors are not Mexico and Canada like America's neighbors. There have been serious threats in our region and we need to take necessary steps for Turkey's interests.\"\nThis shows that Turkey's actions are so far aimed at maintaining the status quo. \nThis fact also implies that it would probably not take Georgia's part in a case in which Russia deploys troops or otherwise jeopardises the territorial integrity of Georgia. The only real possibility would be in the case of a trackable cyberattack with high impact, directed at a NATO member state. It certainly does have the capability to do so, but whether Putin would actually go through with such an offence is very questionable. It seems like Putin's style is to resort to remaining in the shade and publishing fake news.

The two main reasons are that an increased military presence along the border would decrease the area where insurgent actions could be performed, and it would also increase the likelihood that insurgents would confront NATO troops sooner than later, thus, raising the probability of an open hostile conflict between Russia and the NATO (accordingly to Art. 5 & 6).  Based on this assessment, the deployment of 1\u2019000 US troops in Poland would result in a decreased likelihood for Russian backed insurgent actions. Furthermore, the reactivation of the 2nd US fleet (responsible to patrol the North Atlantic and the Arctic region) and the upcoming joint fleet exercise in the Baltics (aka. BALTOPS) would furthermore decrease opportunities for Russia to conduct hidden military operations. However, this is the rationale of Western \u2018hawks\u2019. Indeed, it is likely that Russia will respond to the recent deployment of US troops by stationing own troops in Belarus as it did in the past with the deployment of intermediate-range ballistic missiles as a response to NATO\u2019s expanded presence along the Eastern and South-Eastern border of its \u201calliance territory\u201d (NATO, 2019). This accumulation of military resources on each side would increase the likelihood for further tensions (as all involved counterparties feel threatened in their national security), as well as, the uncertainty of severe or lethal collisions by accident. Two indicators tend to support the latter argument of increased tensions through the militarization of eastern Europe: a) military exercises expand regarding the number of participating military personnel and hardware in the last 10 years; b) incidents between forces above the Baltic Sea, Black Sea and the Mediterranean.  Another aspect to assess is if NATO members, other than the US, may change their behaviour based on recent events. There are again two possible scenarios which have an opposing effect on each other. On the one hand, the reactivation of the 2nd US fleet, deployment of troops and the upcoming BALTOPS may be perceived by NATO members as a sufficient signal of US commitment to the alliance which boosts the NATO credibility and its deterrence towards Russia. On the other hand, this renewed commitment of the US could tempt eastern NATO members to take a more aggressive and provoking stance against Russia, hence, increasing tensions and the likelihood for a conflict (in whatever form). The result might be the invocation of Art. 4 or (less likely) 5.  So far, this update focused on the deployment of military resources and its likely influence on the behaviour of Russia, the US and NATO members. Therefore, this paragraph focuses on statements made by Trump and Putin. Indeed, both country leaders declared their interest in normalizing US-Russian relations. Nonetheless, Putin admits that the current trend is one of deterioration. The US government approved the deployment of new military assets and the introduction of new sanctions despite Trump\u2019s statement. As a result, the stressed commitments in favour of normalization should be overestimated concerning the other trends mentioned above.  In the end, the reallocation of military resources by each side to deter the other party indicate that the US-Russian relationship won\u2019t normalize soon, despite contradicting statements of the country leaders. Therefore, the probability should be adjusted by 5% in favour of an invocation of Art. 4 or 5. Future updates will focus on the activities of non-US NATO members to assess if these tend to become more confrontational or passive-defensive towards Russia.

When Poland in Match 2014 chose to invoke the article on the basis of the rising tensions in Ukraine. Article 5 has been invoked once, by the US following the events of 9/11. Based on this data one can state that there is a very low probability that either of the articles will be invoked by the 1st of January 2020. There seems to be a rather high threshold among the NATO member state in general to invoke the articles, meaning that a serious rise in tensions or a single/number of serious events would need to occur before the states would even consider invoking.   As several of my classmates have pointed out the chance that article 5 will be invoked in regard to Russia is especially low, based on the sphere of international politics. Considering the fact that one knows that Russia is especially focused on states like Georgia and Ukraine, who are not NATO members, nor will become so before the 1st of January 2020.    With article 4 on the other hand, there are more scenarios that are likely to happen which will lead to the article being invoked, however, I would like to stress that the probability is still low. Over the past few years tensions between \u201cthe West\u201d and Russia have begun to rise in specific areas, such as the Artic, disinformation campaigns, cyber-attacks and so on. Especially scenarios including disinformation campaigns and potential cyber-attacks draws my attention in regard to article 4. Many NATO states will over the course of the next half year seen elections in all forms, were most of the state have stressed the importance of limiting disinformation campaigns and cyber-attacks especially concerning Russia. If one of the states were to observe such a campaign or a cyber-attack with connections to Kremlin, article 4 could potentially be invoked. However, it is a difficult situation as it can be hard to find hard evidence of Russia\u2019s involvement in such attacks, which again means that invoking the article without proof could sour the already somewhat difficult relations NATO and its members have with Russia. This is why I still believe that the likelihood of any of the articles being invoked is extremely low, and why I have set my forecast at a 5%.      - https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-48296557\n- https://www.vocaleurope.eu/should-we-expect-a-russian-disinformation-campaign-during-the-2019-european-elections/\n- https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_166039.htm\n- https://www.rferl.org/a/explainer-nato-articles-4-and-5/24626653.html"], [67423, "2019-06-09T21:12:14Z", [0.1], ""], [67416, "2019-06-09T10:51:34Z", [0.03], "Update: \nEuropean Elections has passed.

Article 5 has so far only been invoked once after the 9/11 terrorist attacks against the US (https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_110496.htm). I do not believe that Russia will attack any NATO member state with armed forces within the next seven months, even though it is hard to predict. The one thing necessary to consider, however, is invoking Art. 5 on grounds of a cyber attack stemming from Russia against one of the NATO - members, as cyber attacks, as well, are included in Art. 5 of the Washington Treaty (https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/natosource/nato-updates-policy-offers-members-article-5-protection-against-cyber-attacks ; https://www.nato-pa.int/download-file?filename=sites/default/files/2019-04/087_STC_19_E%20-%20NATO.pdf). A cyber attack stemming from Russia is a credible threat (https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/2019-ATA-SFR---SSCI.pdf). Yet, in light of the current publications of the Mueller report and the unveiling of Russia's probable involvement in the 2016 US elections a cyber threat is not very probable right now, considering Russia is already under watch. As well, Russia is in no direct conflict currently with any NATO member state which would give reason for attack (even though of course reason is not necessarily needed). Furthermore, if a cyber attack were to occur it is not necessarily clear where it originates from, hence even if Russia were to issue a cyber attack against one NATO member state it might not even be disclosed immediately. Overall, invoking Art. 5 seems unlikely to me.  On the other hand, Art. 4 of the Washington Treaty includes the consultation \"whenever, in the opinion of any of them, the territorial\nintegrity, political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened\" (Art.4; https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/stock_publications/20120822_nato_treaty_en_light_2009.pdf). Hence calling a meeting to consult about military matters. So far, this article has been invoked 3 times by Turkey, latest with reference to attacks in Syria in 2012,  as well as by Latvia, Lithuania and Poland in 2014 as response to the Crimea crisis. Since that crisis in 2014 the NATO-Russia relations have been deteriorating (https://sputniknews.com/europe/201906071075727696-nato-pays-very-close-attention-to-activities-of-russia-china-in-europe/). Yet, more concrete threats of Russia are rather posed against non-NATO members such as Georgia, after the Russia-Georgian war 2008, or the Ukraine, after the Crimean-Annexation. Moreover, considering that Article 4 has very rarely been invoked in the past, it is unlikely to happen. Here, again though I see the most probable reason for invoking Article 4 to be a possible cyber attack issued from Russia. Yesterday, 07th June 2019, Russian and US warships almost collided in the East Chinese Sea with both parties claiming the other is at fault (https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-48553568). It is relevant to keep an eye to these developments in the upcoming days, whether the US considers its territorial integrity, political independence or security threatened.  Overall, I still don't think it is that unlikely to happen, as actions with Russia in the past have been rather difficult to predict and many things can happen in 7 upcoming months. Therefore I keep my percentage between 15 and 20%, as I believe anything less would diminish the possibility too much.

The Article 5 stipulates that \u201cthe Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them [\u2026] will assist the Party or Parties [\u2026]\u201d (ibis.). The article has been invoked once since the establishment of the alliance when the US called its NATO allies after the 9/11 terror attacks. The Article 6 complements Article 5 by providing clarity about what constitutes an \u201carmed attack\u201d (ibis.). It defines that an attack on the \u201cterritory of any of the Parties\u201d and/or \u201con the forces, vessels, or aircraft of any of the Parties\u201d justify the invoking of Article 5. It is extremely unlikely that Russia would dare to attack a NATO member as it would face the whole NATO alliance. Furthermore, the deployment of allied troops along the eastern border of the NATO (especially the Baltics) decreases the probability that Russia would try to use the infamous \u201clittle green men\u201d tactic as it did in Ukraine. As a result, and despite recently growing tensions, this forecast assesses a X < 1% probability for this scenario to occur.  Article 4 stipulates that \u201cthe Parties will consult together whenever, in the opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened\u201d (NATO). Article 4 has been invoked only 5 times since the NATO treaty entered into force in 1949. The past invocations of Article 4 accorded with major conflicts such as the Iraq war, the Syrian conflict and the emergence of ISIS when Turkey requested its NATO allies to consult on behalf of its security. The 2014 invocation of Article 4 by Poland demanded a NATO consultation concerning the Ukrainian crisis. Especially the proven involvement of Russian armed forces caused discomfort along NATO\u2019s eastern border. Particularly countries with Russian minorities suspect that Russia may use the same justification like in Ukraine (protecting its ethnical people from illicit prosecution) in order to undermine their sovereignty.  Indeed, the Russian Federation considers itself the official successor of the USSR. Therefore, it deems the NATO expansion towards eastern Europe, into former soviet states, as a crucial threat to its national security as this expansion policy implies a decline of Russia\u2019s sphere of influence and leads to an enclosing of NATO troops. The vast area between Russia and Central Europe is seen as a decisive factor for defending against conquests such as the past invasions of Napoleon or Hitler. It could be argued that it is in Russia\u2019s interest if the NATO dissolves itself or looses its internal coherence. However, it seems very unlikely that Russia would commit further actions which will significantly increase the already high tensions. Its economic and military situation (economic recession and the resource heavy demand of military involvements in several conflicts) doesn\u2019t allow any further military confrontations. Other reasons for invoking Article 4 could be Russia\u2019s strategy to secretly influence NATO members through cyber attacks, misinformation campaigns or the attempt to influence elections. However, these technics and goals have been existing for the last years and didn\u2019t provoke the activation of the article yet. Instead, NATO countries started programs to counter these attempts which might reduce their threat in future years. Additionally, assigning a cyber attack to a specific source is very difficult and, hence, reduces the likelihood that a NATO member will use cyber attacks as legal basis for invoking Article 4.  This forecast assesses a low probability for an invocation of any article before the 1st of January 2020. Article 5 and 6 stipulate specific legal requirements which Russia is not likely to provide as it would result in open hostilities. Article 4 on the other hand could be triggered more easily. Nonetheless, it had been invoked only 5 times so far, and in 4/5 cases by Turkey without a direct connection to Russia, despite high tensions between Russia and the NATO. It seems very unlikely that this article will be invoked by a NATO member in a time of \u201cfrozen\u201d conflicts rather than \u201chot\u201d ones.

The last case was the first and last time when A4 has been invoked against Russian actions. Secretary General of Nato announced that cyber attack can trigger a state to invoke A5.

Below are the major points on which I base my assumption. Under Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty a member state can call a meeting of NATO members to consult on the matters of \u201cthe territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the parties\u201d being threatened.  Article 4 has been invoked 4 times. Most of the time by Turkey and once by Latvia, Lithuania and Poland as a response to Russia\u2019s intervention in Ukraine in 2014. The same can happen if Russia uses military forces against Ukraine in the upcoming months or decides to invade Georgia after 2008. I\u2019ve read the forecast of @iwheeler stating that Turkey might invoke the Article 4 if Russia attacks Georgia. However, as a Georgian, I would highly doubt that, since in 2008 Georgia hasn\u2019t received such support from Turkey and it can\u2019t be expected in the upcoming years either.  Putin believes that in order to gain more internal support, he needs to bring victory to the country. Therefore, using military forces against non-NATO member countries might be considered as a common practice for him. Non-NATO states other than Ukraine or Georgia can be Sweden or Finland, yet another reason of invoking Article 4 against Russia. However, I would highly doubt that Putin would risk to go against countries like Sweden and Finland. Even though there\u2019s been an article published by Foreign Policy of the former president of Georgia, Mikheil Saakashvili, stating that Putin is losing people\u2019s support and his next targets are either Sweden or Finland, we should not forget that Saakashvili might not be objective and while assessing the actual threats he might be influenced by personal feelings and prejudices (another statement from me as a Georgian).  So, the major targets for Russia are still Ukraine and Georgia. The conflict between Russia and Georgia might be considered as a frozen one. 20% of Georgia is still occupied by Russia, moving the so-called \u201cborders\u201d further into Georgia and killing innocent citizens near those \u201cborders\u201d. The situation in Ukraine is also similar. I assume that there won\u2019t be escalation to these conflicts before 2020. Hence, even though it\u2019s become very frequent to invoke article 4, I still assume that in the upcoming months it is not going to take place.  Another reason for the Article 4 to be invoked might be cyber-attacks or interference in the upcoming elections of the European elections. However, I assume that after the outcome (publishing of the Mueller report and the tense relations between the US and Russia) of interfering in the US presidential elections, Russia will play its cards smarter.  Article 5 has been invoked only once by the US after 9/11. Under the Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty, each member state can perceive an armed attack against one of the NATO member states as an armed attacked against all of the members. Invoking article 5 against Russia means that Russia would attack one or several member states of the NATO. Current relations between the NATO member states and Russia exclude military intervention in the upcoming 7 months.

When invoked, article 4 merely calls for a consultation of allies on a subject the invoked finds pressing. The idea being that a allies can offer help and NATO can possible come up with joint resolutions of actions in order to support each other. Meanwhile Article 5 is the famous one, where the invasion of one country is the invasion of all and all NATO members are obliged to provide assistance to the invoking state. For over 50 years, neither of these articles were invoked, but starting with 9/11 there has been a significant increase in invocation. Since Nato's inception, Article 4 has only been invoked 5 times. Once by Poland on March 3rd, 2013, in regards to the unfolding events in Ukraine and Russia's involvement. Then four times by Turkey, first on February 10th, 2003 due to the war in Iraq, next on June 22nd, 2012 after a Turkish fighter jet was shoe down by Syrian air defense systems, next on October 3rd, 2012 when 5 Turkish citizens were killed by a Syrian shells, then finally on July 26th 2015 following several terrorist attacks. Meanwhile, Article 5 has only been invoke once and that was famously by the U.S. in the wake of 9/11.  When looking holistically it seems rare for either article 4 or 5 to be invoked and while this is true of article 5, article 4 was invoked 5 times in just three years in recent history due to geopolitical conflicts. Therefore, it can be seen as an increasing useful tool of NATO members to show receive help while flexing the alliances muscles. Thereby, it is not unreasonable to think that article 4 could be invoked by a member state by January 1st 2020. That said, Turkey has been the major invoker, meaning that other states have either shown restraint or are not as threatened, but either way it is far more likely that Turkey will invoke article 4 than any other member state. Finally in regards to Russia, these articles have only been invoked once due to Russian actions and it is unlikely article 4 will be invoked again due to the Ukrainian crisis unless Russia severely ramps up its involvement. Russia has also settled down recently by not involving itself in new conflicts. The one recent one, which Russia has shown interest is Venezuela, but due to proximity it is highly unlikely for Russia to engage militarily in any fallout that happens there. Also the only NATO member that could conceivably invoke article 4 in response to events in Venezuela would be the US, which is unlikely due to Trump's more go it alone attitude towards NATO.  Therefore, if either either article 4 or 5 were to be invoked by January 1st, 2020, it would likely be due to a new arising conflict or it could be related to cyberspace. In regards to what states would likely invoke either article due to conflict it would likely be NATO border states. The following are the most likely scenarios for invocation. Romania, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia could conceivably invoke article 4 if Russia significantly increased its military presence in Ukraine and went on the offensive. Turkey might invoke article 4 if Russia were to invade Georgia again. Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania could invoke article 4 if Russia began significant military maneuvers close to the border and of course article 5 if there is engagement. Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Canada or the US could invoke article 4 or 5 in regards to increasing Russian military actions in the Arctic. Finally, in July of 2016 NATO recognized cyberspace has an important domain which NATO must protect as much as air, land and sea. Russia has used cyber attacks in the past, but mainly in conjunction with physical action such as its attacks on Ukraine and Georgia. However, Russia has also launched cyber attacks independently of military action such has the 2007 attacks on Estonia. Therefore, it is conceivable that a NATO member state could invoke article 4 or 5 after a particularly devastating cyber attack. However, these attacks are often hard to trace back and to unequivocally place blame on a certain state for. Also, most states engage in some kind of cuber attacks and many member states are constantly barrages, but to date none of these myriad of attacks have triggered an article invocation, making it unlikely that an article could be invoked in less than a year due to cyber attacks.  In sum, I find it extraordinarily unlikely that article 5 will be invoked by January 1st 2020 due to Russian actions and would give this a 0.1% chance of happening, because of the low historical precedent and the magnitude of the events that would have to occur for it to be invoked. However, I find it significantly more likely that article 4 could be invoked by this time due to Russia, but all the scenarios I outlined above are still highly unlikely to cause an article invocation in the next 7 months, because the current geopolitical hostilities do not warrant invocation and would therefore have to significantly deteriorate. Yet it remains plausible and therefore would give this a likelihood of 5%, but since decimals are not supported here, I'm lowering it to 4.9% in order to give me a combined total of 5%. https://www.nato.int/cps/su/natohq/topics_49187.htm\nhttps://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_110\nhttps://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_78170.htm"], [35217, "2019-05-05T06:48:05Z", [0.03], ""], [70711, "2019-05-04T22:03:40Z", [0.02], ""], [67411, "2019-05-04T14:22:45Z", [0.05], "Baseline: Article 5 was invoked only once in 2001 following 9/11 attacks while Article 4 was invoked 4 times - 3 times by Turkey and once by Lithuania, Latvia and Poland following the Crimea crisis. The latter case is the only time when the article was invoked in response to actions taken by Russia. Article 5 is a keystone of the whole NATO organisation while Article 4 is limited to consultations solely if the country feels that its independence or security is threatened. However, even invoking Article 4 is considered to be a rare event. As we only consider Russia's actions, the chances of using article 4 or 5 are even smaller.\nTwo things to consider are Russia-Ukraine war and cyber attacks. Regarding the first, it is one of the possible scenarios why Article 4 could be invoked again. However, even if suddenly Russia highly increases the military actions in Ukraine, it is unlikely to expect NATO involvement. Even though Ukraine is a NATO partner but as we can see from previous cases, comments being a partner or being an actual member to whom NATO is committed to highly changes the plan of actions. Cyber attacks could be a possible trigger to invoke Article 4, however, it is not a secret that cyber attacks are still considered to be a new way of war and NATO is still working on definition of understanding what actions should be considered severe enough to invoke the Article 4 or even 5.

Poland and Lithuania jointly invoked article 4 in response to Russia\u2019s actions in Crimea in 2014 and this is the only use of article 4 that has been warranted by Russian actions. Article 5 has only been invoked once \u2013 in response to 9/11. However, in 2014, Turkey did consider invoking article 5 in response to the Syrian war and the shooting down of a Turkey\u2019s jet. This was never realized and the then Secretary General of NATO, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, expressed hesitancy for NATO to engage militarily.  Since the 2014 Polish-Latvian call on article 4, in response to the Russian seizure of Crimea, Russia has engaged in a number of activities that have been deemed \u2018aggressive\u2019 by the international society. These include the fighting in the Donbas region of Ukraine, the suspected Russian submarine in Swedish territorial waters, as well at the increasing Military presence in the Arctic region. However, none of these \u2018physical\u2019 actions have warranted NATO members to formally invoke either of the articles.  However, Russia has been increasingly involved in cyberattacks in a number of different countries; including the involvement in the 2016 US election. As agreed in 2014, cyberattack on a NATO member state are now covered by article 5. Moreover, NATO\u2019s Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg, has recently called on Russia to cease their \u201creckless behavior\u201d as he spoke of a recent Russian cyberattack. This public announcement could indicate that future digital attacks from Russia could result in invocations of article 4 or 5.  In conclusion, considering the rarity with which articles 4 and 5 have been invoked, despite a number of condemned Russian actions, it seems unlikely that such an event should occur now. However, a Russian cyberattack or involvement in a national election could be of such gravity that the affected member state would choose to formally invoke one of the two articles. Hence, I assign a 15 % probability to this forecast.

So basically members can bring any issue of concern to the table for discussion within the North Atlantic Council. An Article 4 meeting was already invoked by Poland on 3 March 2014 as a response to the extraterritorial Crimean crisis, thus involving actions taken by Russia. Lastly, on 26 July 2015, Turkey requested that the NAC convene under Article 4 in view of the seriousness of the situation following heinous terrorist attacks. (https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_49187.htm). \nThe principle of collective defence is enshrined in Article 5 of the Washington Treaty. Collective defence means that an attack against one Ally is considered as an attack against all Allies. NATO invoked Article 5 for the first (and only) time in its history after the 9/11 terrorist attacks against the United States, but it has taken collective defence measures on several occasions, for instance in response to the situation in Syria and in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine crisis (https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_110496.htm). Putin has a history of using foreign policy issues in order to boost its internal popularity, which has fallen at 32% (the lowest since 2006). Thus a further move has to be expected. Foreign policy experts deem Russia capable of attacking not only former Soviet states, but also countries such as Sweden and Finland, which is worth reminding are EU members but not NATO members. This scenario would not of course imply Russian tanks rallying over Stockholm or Helsinki, but creating tensions around some remote Arctic enclave or small islands.

However, January 2020 is quite close in time, and it is hard to imagine such scenario to really occur. The situation in Crimea seems stable at the moment, as further territorial claims have not been advanced.

So far in history, it has been invoked only once after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Personally, I can\u2019t imagine any possibility of a military or terroristic attack caused by Russia before the 1st January 2020, because no-one would gain any advantage from it, still less Russia. In spite of Russia being a global power, NATO is the most powerful military alliance existent which Russia has better not to challenge. Russia doesn\u2019t have enough economic neither military power to face the eventual countermeasures taken by the entire NATO community, and I\u2019m talking both about hard measures as military intervention and economic ones, like sanctions (which it is already suffering because of the Crimea issue). \nAbout Ukraine issue: a military intervention by Russia has already occurred (I\u2019m referring to Crimea war), but Ukraine is not a NATO country and I don\u2019t think is going to be part of it by next year. First of all, the domestic policy is too fragile now, the citizens are divided between pro-Europe and pro-Russia, plus the next president is likely to be Zelensky, quite close to Crimea requests and slightly filo-Russian. Neither the NATO would like to include it in its alliance in such a short amount of time and without any guarantee of stability in the country. Article 4 states the possibility for each member to ask for a NATO meeting to consult the members in case it feels its territorial integrity, independency or security threatened. Article 4 has been invocated only four times (most of them by Turkey) and only once against Russia. This article is objected of a very broad interpretation, indeed \u201cmembers can bring any issue of concern, especially related to the security of a member country, to the table for discussion within the North Atlantic Council.\u201d As we known, nowadays major threats to national security are no-more only the military ones, but a lot of others are included, regarding environmental, humanitarian, or energy security: that\u2019s why invoking art. 4 from a NATO country is more likely to happen. Let\u2019s check the various scenarios. Ukraine issue: what Russia does there can scare the countries of the area, historically threatened by Russia (Baltic states or Poland, which had already invoked article 4 in 2014 as a response to Russian intervention in Crimea). Cyber security issue: currently, the most likely threat that a NATO country could experience by Russia are cyberattacks. In 2016 US elections we have had proof of it and in EU exists a special task force to contrast such a phenomenon. The possibility becomes more real if we consider that in May there will be European elections, where Russia has the interest to interference in order to keep European countries divided. However, I still think is not enough a strong reason to bother the treaty. Artic issue: according to what we have learnt in the 1st semester, various Arctic states are contesting some territories and sea areas, because of the opening of new arctic routes and presence of natural resources. One of them, especially Norway, could invoke this article if Russia goes too far in its demonstration of power. Also, those countries seems to cooperate in order to don\u2019t increase the tension. Gas supplies issue: 74% of the gas consumed in EU is imported by Russia, a card to play to blackmail Europe. In that case Europe could feel threatened. However, I don\u2019t see it very likely to happen because most of the Russian incomes are from the gas exports, and without them its economic situation, already precarious, would worsen. Also, there are concretes evidence of Russian interests in trading with Europe, like the construction of Nord Stream 2.  Nuclear issue: after the withdrawal from the INF, we wait to see what will happen with the New START agreement between Russia and US. It\u2019s quite clear that it will be renovated or extended but, in any case, the two powers will keep an agreement and there won\u2019t be a tension escalation before 2020. I don\u2019t see any point in threatening countries of a nuclear attack: doing that wouldn\u2019t worth against a weak country and would be too dangerous against the US (we all learnt something from the Cold War, right?). Accidents: do you remember the Malaysia Airlines civil aircraft shot down from a land-based missile in 2014, while was flying over East Ukraine? In that occasion Ukrainian separatists and then Russia have been blamed. If something similar happens again in a NATO country or against one of its means of transport, maybe during some contested military trainings/intelligence activities, article 4 can be invoked. In conclusion, I believe all of these scenarios extremely unlikely, except for the ones regarding cyber and arctic threats.

Article 5 pertains armed attacks against a NATO member, and I consider the probability of such event before 1 January 2020 absolutely unlikely. The last consideration derives from the facts that:\n- article 5 has been invoked only once, by the US after 9/11. As such, article 5 has never been invoked after a direct attack from a country to a NATO member\n- the scenario in which Russia decides to directly attack a NATO member is extremely unlikely, for the very reason that it's a NATO member and because of the very existence of article 5. It's not in Russian interest - or in any state's - to ignite the collective countermeasures linked to an armed attack to a member state, NATO is still the most powerful military alliace in the world, and in the foreseeable future the world military lead will be held by the US and the NATO system. (Probability: 0%).\nMoving on, it is necessary to fully understand what are the possible reasons which could lead to a formal invocation of article 4. The latter is: \"The Parties will consult together whenever, in the opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened.\" (for the consultation, see https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_17120.htm). This article is much broader in meaning in comparison with article 5: first of all, it refers to every member's opinion about what they feel threatening. While every state has their own \"national style\" in detecting possible threats deriving from their interests and positions, we can assume that a formal invocation of article 4 would follow a threat recognized among all NATO members as such. While there isn't a checklist of all threats considered as such on a NATO level, we know that \"during the 1990s NATO significantly broadened the range of what it now considers to be security challenges: cybersecurity, instability beyond NATO\u2019s borders, terrorism, energy security, health risks, climate change and water scarcity are explicitly mentioned in the 2010 Strategic Concept, something probably unthinkable only fifteen years before\" (http://www.act.nato.int/images/stories/events/2015/acor/ac15_final.pdf, page 5. For an overlook on NATO's strategic concept, see https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_56626.htm and https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_27433.htm). With this insight, we can assume that, with the right motivation and drivers, any threatening behaviour Russia could assume in the next months against a NATO member could lead to an article 4's invocation. Basically, it's impossible to restrict the analysis this way. It is more useful to invert the question: which perceived threats against NATO members could be Russia responsible for in the next months?\nFirst of all, I want to start with Ukraine, which is not a NATO member, but it could become one very soon - NATO-Ukrain relationships became increasingly closer after the Crimea's invasion (see https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_37750.htm). Ukraine is currenlty under elections. Both possible future presidents - Petro Poroshenko and Volodymyr Zelenskiy - are, to different degrees, pro EU and pro NATO. Nevertheless, we can expect that for Ukrain to join NATO will take a while - the most probable elections' winner, Zelenskiy, is willing to make a referendum over joining NATO, which obviously will take time (https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2019-04-02/will-comic-actor-become-ukraines-next-president). For these reasons, I don't think Ukraine will even have the possibility to invoke any NATO article sooner than the 1 January 2020 (probability: 0%).\nI started with Ukraine because it's the only country near the NATO influence zone affected by direct Russian armed violence. For the actual NATO member's analysis, I will try to outline which main threats they could perceive from Russia in the next months. \nRussia is one of the main Euroean energy supplier and, as already stated, NATO members can perceive as a threat the loss of energy security. In the event in which Russia - for any reason - threatens or actually decide to cut energetic supplies to Europe, NATO members could decide to invoke article 4. This scenario is extremely unlikely for several reasons: the energetic dependency corresponds to a Russian economic dependency from energetic revenues, which would mean very bad Russian economic performance, which is something you don't really want when elections approach - even if Russian elections are questinable in matters of democratic procedures.  Moreover, Russia threatening Europe or actually blocking the supplies is a scenario we already saw (https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/world/europe/07gazprom.html) without the invocation of article 4. (probability: 0%). \nAnother source of threat could be a perceived threat after Russian strategies of nuclear intimidation. I won't really argument about this, I just think it won't happen at all (probability: 0%).\nAnother source of threat could be about environmental security. Denmark is currently blocking Gazprom's North Stream 2 by advancing possible environmental problems linked with the project. Nevertheless, Russia has a plan B (https://russiabusinesstoday.com/energy/denmark-still-deciding-on-nord-stream-2-approval/) which will likely imply the same environmental issues (the pipelined would only not pass through Denmark's exclusive economic zone, but really near). This could lead Denmark to invoke article 4. I just don't think that this issue could lead Denmark to take such a strong stand against Russian interests and projects, it would have several diplomatic implications and countereffects. Moreover, article 4 in the past has never been invoked for environmental issues (probability: o%). \nAnother source of perceived threats could arise from Russian military exercises, most of all for European countries near the Russian borders (all NATO members). If those countries feel threatened by the military display - which could be understandable with the Ukranian situation - they could invoke article 4. As military exercises are not foreseeable (and definetly not scheduled in documents I have the access to), I would say that it could be possible, but military exercises has never been motive of article 4's invocation (probability: 0,5%). \nThe last two sources of possible perceived threat I could think of are interlinked, and, in my opinion, the most relevant. Russia is well known, or at least it's suspected, to have cyber camapaigns and intelligence operations aimed at influencing foreign countries' policies, most of all in the event of elections - one of the most direct influences you can have over a country's policy is by trying to make a candidate/party whose program is in line with your interests win the elections. In 2019, there will be many elections (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_elections_in_2019, Europe section). The occasion for cyber attacks are definetly incalculable, the interests which could lead Russia to adopt them in any NATO member state are incalculable as well - at least, I don't have the expertise to do such assessment. Moreover, a NATO member, given the new broad threat dimension outlined in the aforementioned 2010's NATO strategy, could decide to invoke article 4 after an especially severe cyber attack, or if intromissions in national elections were found. The latter two possibilities, though, would be difficult to demonstrate to be Russian-led, and even so, they could not lead to the invocation to article 4 - a national investigation, a UN inquiry, or a bilateral peaceful confrontation could happen instead - (probability: 5.5%).\nAdding the future events' probabilities underlined until here leads me to think to a 6% probability of a NATO member invoking article 4 in response to actions taken by Russia. I added a precautios 2% because of unforeseeable factors and possible scenarios - or simply scenarios I couldn't think of."], [49838, "2019-04-07T22:06:31Z", [0.03], ""], [23006, "2019-04-07T22:04:50Z", [0.03], ""], [67429, "2019-04-07T18:15:27Z", [0.1], "In the history of NATO, Article 5 has only been invoked once. It was invoked in response to the unprecedented 9/11 attacks \u2014 which at the time fell out of the realm of \u2018normal\u2019 global conflict. Russian actions do not fall out of the realm of \u2018normal\u2019. They are known, anticipated and somewhat predictable in the eyes of the international community. Given the base rate, and the implications of invoking article 5 \u2014 motioning possible collective response \u2014 this is considered highly unlikely.  The invocation of of article 4 however, has occurred five times \u2014 four times by Turkey, once by Poland. The latter, in 2014, occurred in response to Ukrainian-Russian tensions in Ukraine.  Late last year, tensions re-escalated dramatically after Russia seized Ukrainian ships and detained crewmen (which have reportedly been serving their sentence in Moscow) after tensions have been building for months (BBC 26 Nov 2018).  At the same time, Russia has supported Assad in Syria, been suspected of undertaking submarine activity in the Nordic countries, has been involved in undermining foreign democracies and conducted systematic campaigns of cyber attacks. All this has gone without any formal invocation of Article 4, indicating Russia must instigate a major activity in order to incite response through Article 4 \u2014 there appears to be a considerable level of tolerance to Russian actions to date.   Thus, given the low rate of invocation and considering that Russia\u2019s more questionable activities are known and ongoing, it seems unlikely a NATO member will formally invoke Article 4 (or 5) before the end of this year. It is forecasted at 10% to allow for the possibility of an escalation that would incite real concern by a member."], [67422, "2019-04-07T16:18:03Z", [0.1], "Article 4 is intended to provide the opportunity for a NATO member State to call for a meeting with the 28 other member States, to \u201cconsult\" when it feels its independence or security are threatened.\nArticle 5 is the core article of the Alliance, best summarized by the principle of \u201cone for all, all for one\u201d in the face of external threat.  Historically, article 4 was invoked four times and only one time it involved Russia. Poland invoked Article 4 on 3 March 2014 following the rise of tensions in neighbouring Ukraine. Article 5 was invoked only after the events of 9/11, by the United States \u2014 an act seemingly symbolic as the invocation of the article was against terrorism and not against one particular State. \nTaking the above mentioned as a basis for the forecast, there is too little chance that a NATO member will formally invoke Article 4 or Article 5 of the Washington Treaty in response to actions taken by Russia, before 1 January 2020. Indeed, there is a very low tendency among NATO member States to actually invoke the given articles.  Furthermore, in the face of the current state of affairs, there is a very low chance that the article 5 will be invoked any time soon. With regard to Russia\u2019s territorial ambitions, for now they are very focused on Ukraine and Georgia that are not NATO members, or will not become NATO members before 1 January 2020.  The chances for the invocation of Article 4 are little higher in comparaison to Article 5, but remain quite low. There are indeed topics that could awaken anxiety at this time or in the following months. For example in the Arctic, despite the climate of cooperation, NATO seeks to show its muscles at the Russian-Norwegian border which irritates Moscow. In the case of an escalation,  one could imagine that the feeling of insecurity takes on a new dimension and thus consider an invocation of Article 4 namely from an Arctic State (Norway). But taking into account the interests of all Arctic States for cooperation in the region, it is more likely that there is no need for an invocation of Article 4 since the probabilities for military escalation are very limited. Other topics could be considered; most importantly, the cyber threat coming from Russia. The European elections are approaching and the Russian interferences through cyber means are very often suspected and feared by other countries. Moreover, the annexation of Crimea by Russia plus its ostensible reinforcement of (military) presence in the Baltic region, could lead to an invocation of Article 4 by Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania which adherence to NATO was mostly motivated by their geographical proximity to Russia.  Nevertheless, from the basis of the previous invocation of Article 4 & 5, there is a too little chance that a NATO member formally calls the Alliance for support in response to actions taken by Russia before January 1st 2020. https://www.rferl.org/a/explainer-nato-articles-4-and-5/24626653.html\nhttps://www.nato.int/cps/fr/natohq/topics_110496.htm\nhttps://www.nato.int/cps/fr/natolive/topics_49187.htm\nhttps://www.nato-pa.int/fr/news/la-norvege-continuera-representer-lotan-dans-le-nord\nhttp://www.lefigaro.fr/international/2018/10/25/01003-20181025ARTFIG00192-l-otan-montre-ses-muscles-en-norvege.php\nhttps://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2018/07/11/otan-versus-russie-en-chiffres_5329866_3210.html"], [67417, "2019-04-07T12:01:15Z", [0.15], "GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS\nUnder Article 4, any member state can convene a meeting of NATO members to \"consult\" when it feels its independence or security are threatened. In practice, it has rarely been used and sends a strong political symbol to the greater world that NATO is concerned about a particular situation. Article 5 is known as the \"one-for-all and all-for-one\" article, the keystone of NATO as an organization. It states that an \"armed attack\" against one member is an attack against all and sets in motion the possibility of collective self-defense.\nIn theory, Articles 4 and 5 can only be invoked at the request of a NATO member. However, Article 5 has only been invoked once -- immediately following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks against the United States. Article 5 was not invoked in other cases when it theoretically might have -- such as the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident, the 1968 Pueblo incident, or the 1982 Falklands War -- because it was not requested. All major NATO decisions are made by consensus, so any invocation of Article 5 would require the consent of all 28 member. For instance, Turkey invoked Article 4 in 2003 during the Iraq War and NATO responded by improving security along Turkey's border with Iraq. But the decision was difficult, says NATO Watch Director Ian Davis, because some alliance members opposed military action in Iraq in the first place. However, apparently, the question refers just to \u201ca formal invocation\u201d of article 4 or 5 so whether if accepted or not is out of the scope of this forecast.   FORECAST \nConsidering the historical pattern, the invocation of article 4 or 5 by a NATO member state in relation to Russia seems quite unlikely. In fact, Article 5 has been invoked only once in the aftermath of 9/11 (not because the US really needed help but to send a strong political message to the World). On the other hand, Article 4 has been invoked 4 times so far. However, only 1 time it was in relation to Russia and not even directly: it was invoked by Polonia in 2014 in relation to the Ukraine crisis (Ukraine couldn\u2019t because is not a member of NATO, not yet at least). The other times article four was invoked by Ankara and Russia wasn\u2019t involved.  Hence, with some basic statistics, we could easily assess that this event is highly unlikely (around 1-2% of possibility). However, statistics in forecasting is never enough.  Since the Russian unlawful annexation of Crimea, NATO-Russian\u2019s relationship has been getting worse and worse. Nato has strongly increased its military presence nearby Russia\u2019s borders and in Europe in general. Furthermore, the proxy war in Syria, where Russia and NATO/US sustained two opposite sides, did not help.  That said, I do not see at the current state of affairs situation involving Russia and a NATO member which might lead to the invocation of article 4 (and therefore even hardly article 5). The likelihood could increase with Georgia joining the NATO as it might happen, but January 2020 is too soon to have both its inclusion and already the invocation of one of the 2 articles.  However, what makes the invocation of these articles unpredictable is its high degree of subjectivity. In particular, I would not be surprised if the near future article 4 was invoked in relation to a presumed Russian cybersecurity attack or for some kind of campaign of disinformation. The upcoming European elections make such an outcome not impossible, albeit unlikely. It is true that it would mean broadening the interpretation of these articles far beyond the military threat but, after all, this is exactly in line with the broadening scope of NATO\u2019s mission in recent years.  That said, it is also important to mention that NATO is currently facing a strong internal crisis, especially due to Trump\u2019s delegitimization. Indeed, Trump wants allies to increase the military expenditure (at least until 2% of internal GDP) while countries like Germany have no intention to do so. Furthermore, Turkey and the US, regardless of being both in the North Atlantic Treaty, are now in a huge diplomatic crisis.  Concluding, if one of the two articles will be invoked, except in the evidence of a black swan like in 11/9, it will be in relation to article 4. I see the latter case possible, especially in relation to cybersecurity concerns. However, since the current internal delegitimization of NATO, I assess no more than a 15% chance of this happening in the current year.

Article 4 has been invoked 4 times so far. Only once, when Poland invoked Article 4 on March 3, 2014, following increasing tensions in neighboring Ukraine, it was directed against Russia (https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_49187.htm). The other 4 times Article 4 has been invoked by Turkey.  Article 5\nThe Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.\nAny such armed attack and all measures taken as a result thereof shall immediately be reported to the Security Council. Such measures shall be terminated when the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security . Article 5 has been invoked only once in the aftermath of  9/11.  Thus, based upon its history, the invocation of Article 4 and 5 against Russia seems highly unlikely. Considering 70 years of NATO and one Russian-related invocation, one could - simplified - calculate a 1,4% probability of an invocation in 2019. However, it is worth to take a closer look at current relationships between the NATO and Russia. Relations has been tense. The Ukrainian conflict with Russia that caused the first and so far only invocation of Article 4 against Russia remain unresolved and lasts now already around five years. It was triggered in 2014 by Russia's support for separatists in eastern Ukraine and the annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea. Nato has since significantly increased its military presence in Eastern Europe. In 2017 it stationed around 4000 soldiers in the three Baltic states and Poland (http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/russland-und-ukraine-nato-kuendigt-staerkere-praesenz-im-schwarzen-meer-an-a-1260711.html). In the Syrian war Russia supported Syria's ruler Bashar al-Assad in opposition to the Western alliance. A poison attack on the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Juliya has put a heavy strain on relations with the UK. Similar tense are relations between the US and Russia. Despite all these tensions and bad relations, the forecast at hand does not see any concrete threats at the moment that would motivate one of the NATO members to invoke Article 4 - leave alone 5.  However, threat perceptions are very subjective. Thus, the estimation of the likelihood of an invocation - particularly of article 4 - is aligned with a high degree of uncertainty.  Taken all of the aspects into account (The small invocation rate, tense relations, lack of concrete threat scenarios, high degree of uncertainty due to subjective threat perception of member states), the forecast at hand estimates the likelihood the articles to get invoked in 2019 as of 10%."], [691, "2019-04-05T15:45:57Z", [0.03], ""], [67418, "2019-04-03T09:35:35Z", [0.02], "On the occasion of the 70th anniversary of NATO, which will be celebrated by the Alliance's 29 foreign ministers in Washington on April 4, it may be interesting to ask the question of an invocation of Article 4 or 5 by a member against Russia. Indeed, the current context of relations between NATO and Russia is more than tense. However, before starting the forecasting, it would be useful to recall what Articles 4 and 5 are, their uses and the events of the current context of NATO-Russia relations: Article Definitions:\n- Article 4 : any member state can convene a meeting of NATO members to \"consult\" when it feels its independence or security are threatened (Source : https://www.rferl.org/a/explainer-nato-articles-4-and-5/24626653.html)\n- Article 5 : the keystone of NATO.

(Source : https://www.rferl.org/a/explainer-nato-articles-4-and-5/24626653.html) Invocations of Articles in the past:\n- Article 5 has only been invoked once, immediately following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks against the United States. The decision to invoke the article was\u00a0made collectively by members states, apparently without a request from any individual member.\n-Turkey invoked Article 4 in 2003 during the Iraq War and NATO responded by improving security along Turkey's border with Iraq.\n- Article 4 invoked by Turkey after Syria\u2019s shooting down of a Turkish jet in June 2012 and once again in October 2012 after Syrian attacks on Turkey and their counterattacks\n- In April 2012, Turkish PM\u00a0Erdogan considered invoking Article 5 of the NATO treaty to protect Turkish national security in a dispute over the\u00a0Syrian Civil War.\n- An Article 4 meeting was invoked by Latvia, Lithuania,\u00a0and Poland\u00a0in March 2014 as a response to the extraterritorial\u00a0Crimean Crisis.\n- Turkey announced plans to convoke under Article 4 an extraordinary meeting on 28 July 2015, ostensibly in response to the\u00a02015 Suru\u00e7 Bombing which it attributed to\u00a0ISIS, and other security issues along its southern border\nIn total : \n- Formal : 3 Invocations of Article 4 (by Turkey only), 1 invocation of Article 5 (for 9/11, by all members of NATO)\n- Informal (meeting) : 1 possibility of Article 5 (by Turkey), 2 possibility of Article 4 (1 from Baltic States and Poland, 1 from Turkey) Recent events:\n- The annexation of Crimea in 2014 by Russia, a major point of contention between NATO and the country\n- In 2016, NATO deployed four multinational battlegroups to ensure an \"enhanced forward presence\" in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. In 2017, these battlegroups became fully operational. More than 4,500 European and North American military personnel work in close collaboration with the defense forces of the countries concerned.\n-Trump and his ambiguity with NATO, calling into question the usefulness of the alliance, and strongly insisting that each government carry its military effort to 2% of its GDP in 2024 at the latest (and of which Germany does not will comply, with 1.5% expected for 2024\n- The largest military exercise in NATO's history in Norway in November 2018\n- The dispute between Turkey and the United States, both members of NATO, around the Turkish will to acquire the Russian missile defense system S-400. On the eve of the 70th anniversary, Washington increased pressure on Ankara by suspending any delivery to the Turks in connection with F-35 fighter planes. Forecast:\nIt is therefore necessary for a member state to feel threatened its independence or security, or simply because it is under attack, for an invocation of these articles.\nHowever,\nArticle 4: In practice, it has rarely been used and sends a strong political symbol to the greater world that NATO is concerned about a particular situation.\nArticle 5: The only use of this article (11 September 2001) was asymmetrical because it was not invoked against a particular state, but more generally against terrorism. So there is also a lot of symbolism in it.\nIt seems complicated, apart from an extreme threat, for a Member State to invoke an article directly against Russia, thus announcing an entry into the war between NATO (or at least some members) and Russia (for the article 5). As for Article 4, its invocation would crystallize tensions that were too strong and would necessarily lead to confrontation, which the two parties do not seek, more than the status quo.\nIt must also be remembered that Ukraine is not in NATO, so unfortunately the events in Ukraine can not be taken into account, except if it results in a threat to a Member State. There has been cooperation between NATO and Ukraine since the Warsaw Summit in July 2016, with practical support integrated into the full package of assistance measures for the country. But the country has not made the membership. Moreover, the situation is stabilizing, although many Western countries do not recognize the annexation of Crimea as legal and therefore legitimate.\nArticle 5 was not even mentioned because of this, only Article 4 was discussed by two Baltic States (Latvia, Lithuania) and Poland, and no mention for the situation in Georgia in 2008, nor the Russian intervention in Syria (where Turkey might have felt threatened but ultimately on the contrary cooperates with Russia, which makes the invocation of articles by this country unlikely) or the possible nerve agent attack in the United Kingdom in March 2018 by Russia.\nMoreover, the probable election of Zelensky to Ukraine as president will surely ease tensions, because of his Russophilia and his policy of dialogue with Russia, contrary to the current President Poroshenko.\nIt is therefore more likely of a status quo for the year 2019, than a rise in extreme tension to arrive at the formal invocation by a NATO member state of Article 4 or 5 against Russia.\nThe only possibility would come from a Baltic state, but the relations between Russia and the latter do not seem to be very much tense. The situation is stagnating, and the Baltic countries will always feel threatened by their big neighbour as they all mention in their National Security Strategy, but it would take important new events for things to evolve towards an invocation of one of the two articles.\nIndeed, Russia reserves the right to intervene to protect ethnic Russians outside of its borders (like in Ukraine, in Georgia). However, the political situation in the Baltic countries is stable and the Russian-speaking minorities are not threatened by the government or the population.\nIt is very unlikely that Russia will invade any of the Baltic states for two reasons: the lack of support from local ethnic Russian populations and also for NATO membership. Parallels drawn between ethnic Russian in Estonian and Latvia and in Crimea, Donbas, Abkhazia and South Ossetia end on the surface level (Kyle 2019, 10). There is no support, because they support the geopolitical orientation to the West. So there is no excuse, so no opportunity for a Crimea-like Invasion.\nRegarding others countries of NATO, all are not directly threatened by Russia (hence no possibility of invocation of Article 4 or 5)."], [62808, "2019-04-02T20:41:45Z", [0.03], ""], [39381, "2019-04-02T18:14:31Z", [0.05], ""], [63512, "2019-03-31T19:27:05Z", [0.02], ""], [35814, "2019-03-29T18:26:08Z", [0.0], ""], [63587, "2019-03-27T02:37:53Z", [0.08], "Forecast: 8% chance Article 4 is the most likely situation, especially in the Baltic states who fear actions by Russia.

My heightened probability was a result of chatter of a planned provocation of some sort. That did not occur and I\u2019m thinking it will not occur.  HERE\u2019S WHY: Ukraine\u2019s martial law has lapsed and will not be extended. This is after it was reduced from 60 days to 30 days. Apparently, Ukrainian President Poroshenko was contemplating extending it, but did not do so given the upcoming Ukrainian presidential elections in March. [1] However, enhanced border security appears to be prolonged \u2014 particularly the restriction of Russian males aged 16 through 60. [2] Further, as an act of deterrence, it appears that the US is actively sending a naval force to the Black Sea, as suspected earlier. [3] This is coupled with the planned deployment of a British ship in 2019. [4] ITEMS OF CONCERN: Ukraine is accusing Russia of planning a chemical attack in Eastern Ukraine to sway public opinion against Ukraine. Allegedly, Russia did the same thing in Syria to justify greater airstrikes on insurgent forces. [5,6] Furthermore, the Institute for the Study of War assesses an increased likelihood of escalation given troop movements and Russian propaganda campaigns: \u201cThese data points are consistent with preparations for an attack from the northern Crimean Peninsula toward the Dnepr River near the city of Kherson. Such an attack could be intended to seize the canal supplying fresh water to Crimea, which Ukraine has blocked since the 2014 Russian invasion. Putin would likely unjustifiably claim the right to invade to stop a humanitarian crisis resulting from the blockage of the canal.\u201d [7] However, I\u2019m gathering that ISW had anticipated some advance happening sooner in late December, but they have referenced weather as a prolonging factor. Finally, both Ukraine and Russia adopted economic sanctions on each other within the same day. [8,9] CONCLUSION: While Ukraine acknowledges a threat, it has failed to extend its martial law. Meanwhile, Russia\u2019s actions in the form of troop movements and propaganda alludes to future offenses, but in my opinion they do not appear significant enough to betoken an imminent advance.  I will continue monitoring and do not rule out raising the estimate in the near-future.

It appears that Russia's massing of troops is not new and has been ongoing for years: [1]  \u201cRussia has quartered thousands of troops in the area for nearly five years. The United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, while broadly voicing support for Ukraine, have not corroborated the claim of troops massing at the border.\" \u201cThe Pentagon, too, has been cautious. A Defense Department official said the United States military had not seen a significant buildup of Russian military equipment on the Ukrainian border since the naval episode on Nov. 25, aside from a small number of defensive weapons that were moved in recent days.\u201d\u2028  I'm starting to believe that these calls of escalation are political rallying calls for Ukraine's president. With that said, I would have to agree with other analysts in that Russia is attempting to seize de facto control of the Azov Sea through the Kerch Strait and its consolidation of Crimea -- albeit in a subtle, gradual manner. As one expert hypothesized: [2] \u2018It\u2019s an effort to set a precedent that Russia can then apply to other seas that it would also like to dominate if not control, much as the South China Sea is an expanse that China would like to \u2018own,\u2019  This is accompanied by Russia recently completing a land-bridge with Crimea. [3] Overall, with consideration of my previous estimate, I think that Russia's moves will remain too subtle for any invocation of Article 4; Russia is pursuing the long-game. At the same time, the credibility of deterrence is increasing: adding marginal certainty is NATO's pledge of providing \"secure communications equipment\" to Ukraine's military and the US House of Representatives signaling support for Ukraine in light of recent actions through a simple resolution.

OUTSIDE VIEW: -Article 5 has been invoked once, in response to al-Qaeda's attacks on 9/11. More importantly, it has NOT been invoked in response to Russia. Therefore, the known probability of Article 5 invocations in response to Russia is 0%. -Article 4, depending on sources, has been invoked approximately 5 times -- but only 1 time in response to Russia (by Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland with the annexation of Crimea in 2013). Given that this question is asking if these articles will be invoked in the next year, I'm going to derive a probability estimate based on an invocation in any given year. I'm also going to impose a temporal floor of when Putin first rose to power in 1999. This, in my opinion, marks the beginning of when an invocation of Article 4 in response to Russia would be plausible, as the years preceding witnessed an amicable entente given the collapse of the Soviet Union. This equates to a probability of 1 instance in 19 years of Putin's leadership (~5.3%). -It appears there is a substantial threshold to be surpassed for any of these articles to be invoked: a direct and large-scale attack on a NATO member or its non-NATO neighbors. Despite the salience of recent events with Ukraine and the Kerch Strait, no invocation of Article 4 was witnessed.  INSIDE VIEW: -First, I find it highly improbable (99%) that Russia will launch a large-scale, military attack on a NATO member. This effectively precludes an Article 5 invocation in response to Russia. I will not belabor the reasoning and the academic research to support it, but the magnitude of coordination and cooperation amongst NATO members and the individual attributes of NATO members makes me strongly believe that any Russian attack would elicit a coordinated retaliatory response by the alliance. With this foresight, I believe Russia would avoid such an engagement. Moreover, there appears to be no reason for such a confrontation at this time.  Assuming that another direct and large-scale attack on Ukraine will invoke an Article 4 invocation: -It is my belief that Putin's attacks in Ukraine's Crimea region were spontaneously pursued (not premeditated). This appears to be compatible with similar events that transpired in Georgia in 2008. I view this as insightful for this forecast, given that this spontaneity was produced by an internal crisis, subsequently making a Russian advance to be viewed as auspicious by Putin. In other words, it does not appear that Russia acts under normal conditions -- only when domestic instability is pronounced in its target nations. At this time, I do not see sufficient domestic instability, meaning that I do not believe Russia views there to be an opportunity to make another advance. However, this could change quickly; I will have to keep monitoring.  -It is my belief that Russia, like any nation, will not make an advance if it anticipates future costs imposed by other nations. I believe that there was little evidence to betoken future costs for the annexation of Crimea. More of Ukraine's trade occurred with Russia than Europe, Ukraine produced its own military arms, Ukraine carried no security arrangements with other NATO members, and NATO was militarily inferior in the region of operation. However, this appears to be changing, as more military aid is being funneled into Ukraine by NATO members, the trade balance is shifting away from Russia, and greater communication is occurring between Ukraine and NATO counterparts.   -Finally, to address recent events in the Kerch Strait: it appears to me that there are no statements indicative of future Russian action. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has referenced a mobilization of Russian troops on the Ukrainian border. However, he was speaking at a military forum. Moreover, his poll numbers are low, which is problematic given that he\u2019s a potential candidate for office in the upcoming March, 2019 presidential elections. Some other points: >The apparent martial law has been attenuated from 90 days to 30 days in Ukraine\u2019s Eastern provinces.

[3]\n>US is considering sending a naval fleet to the Black Sea, notifying Turkey.

At first I think it is important to indicate what the articles 4 and 5 are.

Article 5: The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked \u2026 It has been discussed whether a cyber attack would fill up the terms of an attack against a NATO member country. A good example is Estonia. It joined NATO in 2004 and it was cyber attacked by Russia in 2007 stunning the whole country for some time.  NATO's response: In response to such attacks, NATO conducted an internal assessment of their cyber security and infrastructure defenses.  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_cyberattacks_on_Estonia#NATO's_response) In my opinion this sake fills up the article 4, right? I think there is a chance on article 4 before the closing date of this question. Then article 5 raises a questions, whether NATO's task to maintain deterrence is still valid if they only conduct article 4. I would say that if the article 5 happens, it will be a victory for NATO but disaster for world politics at the time.   https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/nato-working-on-cyber-attack-trigger-for-article-5/\nhttps://www.defensenews.com/2017/05/31/nato-might-trigger-article-5-for-certain-cyberattacks/ Further investigation should be done about Russia's information war actions and how they have been handled in other cases.

Despite the tensions that currently comprise West-Russia relations, the post-Cold War military order remains relatively stable for now. If there is going to be a crisis, it would more than likely be relegated to the diplomatic sphere and there is a low chance that it will result in a military conflict. First, it is important to note that despite the loaded dialogues, NATO in general is not as combat ready to fight a large scale war like the one with Russia. Since the end of the Cold War, NATO forces in Europe have been greatly reduced despite the increase in member states. Most weaponry of NATO member states, including the US, has shifted to conducting successful operations against militarily weak states, as was the case in Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, and Iraq. The same reductions are also seen in Russia, whose forces pale in comparison to the height of the Warsaw Pact. A more important reason would be that both NATO and Russia do not have a strong will to fight. In terms of a military response, NATO merely stood and watched as Russia went to war in Georgia, annexed Crimea, and became militarily involved in Donbass. This has sent a clear message to Eastern member states that they may not be able to adequately rely on NATO for help in case of a military conflict. Even though NATO sent forces in Poland and the Baltics, this was done more for political rather than military reasons, as the forces sent are not nearly enough to adequately respond to a large-scale conflict. Russia, as well, is also unprepared for such as large-scale conflict. Although Russia has engaged in a massive military modernization program since the presidency of Putin, Russia's expertise has also been relegated to small scale conflicts such as in Georgia and Ukraine. Many cite the annexation of Crimea as a part of Russia's imperial ambitions, but even Russia is reasonable and knows that it would be economic and military suicide to attempt and restore Russia to the boundaries of the Soviet Union. Despite Russia's annexation of Crimea, Crimeans remain largely loyal to Russia and see Russia as a liberator and Crimea is also a very small territory. If Russia was to go on a campaign of Eastern Europe, it would not only be a huge military and economic cost that would lead to WW3, but even if Russia was successful, it would have to deal with a very hostile population. Russia is also mostly a paper tiger, as we have seen Turkey shoot down a Russian military aircraft, which did not result in a serious military conflict, despite the aggressive rhetoric from the Kremlin. http://carnegieendowment.org/2018/01/25/rethinking-danger-of-escalation-russia-nato-military-balance-pub-75346\nhttps://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21735480-great-powers-seem-have-little-appetite-full-scale-war-there-room\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/31/world/europe/russia-putin-turkey-sanctions.html?mtrref=www.google.com&gwh=11B5B1FDCB625D8DD438B686EC0FC034&gwt=pay"], [34969, "2018-04-17T19:43:58Z", [0.28], ""], [35117, "2018-04-17T18:25:47Z", [0.24], "Let's start with a look at the base rate. Argument 1: Russian aggression has only led once to invocation of Article 4 since 1991, and that was in 2014, on the back of the Ukraine crisis. 1/27 is just about an annualised 3.7%. There's just under 20 months to go so let's round down and call it 6% during the forecast period. As an alternative take however, if we say that Russia has been notably more assertive since 2008 (August War) then that\u2019s one prompting of Article 4 due to Russian action since then which is annualised 10% * (20/12) = 16.7%. This seems a reasonable start to bracketing it. Since an assertive Russia is what we are dealing with, I am leaning towards the higher rate in the current international environment.  Things to consider: Article V is exceedingly unlikely to be used. It has only been invoked once, in extraordinary circumstances (9/11). I suggest NATO would rather avoid an invocation of Article V if at all possible as it seriously tests the solidity of the alliance \u2013 therefore even mumblings of it tend to see pre-emptive action taken to avoid the formal invocation. Key risk re: Russian action leading to an Article V call is probably in the Baltics at the moment, but it is important to remember that a small coalition of NATO forces including lead elements from Canada, UK, US & Germany (https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_146557.htm) are already stationed in the Baltic states & Poland - this would likely discourage minor incidents, and means the Russians would have to be prepared to become seriously aggressive if they wanted to act in this region in a way that would likely cause a trigger of Article V.  Article IV much more likely to be invoked. Four uses this decade. Only use of either article directly related to Russia, by Lat/Lith/Pol over Crimean Crisis/Donbass in 2014 (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-nato-meeting/poland-requests-more-nato-consultations-over-russia-idUSBREA221VS20140303). Obviously the possibility of an increase in Russian aggression remains however; given the current geopolitical situation what would Moscow do to aggravate the situation? A widening of Ukraine conflict or increased aggression in Baltics are both v. high risk for the Kremlin for low reward. The Crimean annexation which caused the first Article IV meeting was a deeply significant geopolitical move. In Russia it was a huge achievement for VVP. Abroad, it sent a chill through the former Warsaw pact nations. Note that previous Russian aggression in the Caucasus failed to provoke such a strong response. It's hard to imagine what strategic objective Russia would try to achieve that could bring about such a significant second shock. Of course that doesn't mean aggressive moves which lead to an Article IV meeting are not possible. Aside from simple recklessness, there are a number of  scenarios, albeit rather unlikely, that might lead down this route (e.g. Regime change/collapse in Belarus which necessitates worrying Russian troop deployments). It simply means that there is no obvious strategic objective at the moment that doesn't come with exceptional risk. Further agitation in Ukraine would be sufficient to unsettle Eastern Europe for instance, but it's not obvious what the objective of that could be. Regime change? To what avail?  Back in the world of currently manifest risks, while I do note the regular aggressive recon flights, border & cyber incidents etc, it's worth remembering that so far these have never necessitated an Article IV meeting, and they have been going on for some time. Unless they step up sharply in frequency/severity/targets I'm not instantly concerned for the purposes of this question.   Article IV could also be a reasonable response to a Salisbury style incident. The counterpoint to which is that surely the Kremlin will be avoiding nerve agents and their ilk for extra-territorial assassinations given the furore after the Skripal incident? Attacks like Salisbury are unusual, and it is the chemical agent that leads to a wider security context of A4/5, not the (attempted) assassination.  Article IV in Turkey: The Turkish front is still a possibility for an Article IV moment. Ankara is historically not afraid to call Article IV consultations, including when they lost an F4 to Syrian air defences (and as we know, this stuff can happen - how would Turkey have responded if Russia had shot down a Turkish jet in late 2015 instead of vice-versa?). Turkey has had 3 calls on Article IV (in 2 separate years) since 2011 (the start of the Arab Spring, which is linked to most of the issues) - this would suggest a rough (2/7) 28 - (3/7) 42% base rate (years/instances) \u2026 of course, none of these were to do with Russia, which calls the usefulness of that base rate into question. Still, it is an observation which highlights Ankara\u2019s fondness for Article IV. A contraindication to the possibility of a Turkish invocation is that there have been generally warming relations between Russia and Turkey since the 2015 incident - but note that they do want opposite outcomes in Syria which could come to the fore as the conflict draws ever more towards a conclusion.  Integrating these factors is tough. Have the multiple calls on Article IV normalised its use in International Affairs in this decade, implying higher usage in the future? Is it simply a case of a unique set of circumstances or a trend that will continue? It is easy to be swayed by the availability heuristic towards a continuation of the current aggressive Russian posture. But tough to see what Russia would stand to gain or where/why/how they would escalate the current situation to the extent of the Crimea crisis, which is the only level of aggression that has previously spurred Article 4\u2019s use. Given all this, and the fact that it is a reasonably long forecasting window, although I generally expect an easing of current Russia related tensions (essentially on the basis of a reversion to the mean - tensions are running unusually high at the moment) there remains a high risk of unforeseen incidents and this must be reflected in a raise above base rate.  Overall then, I think the crowd might be too low on this at the moment. I will start by using the higher baserate (17) and adjusting upwards, at least until we get a bit more clarity regarding the endgame in Syria. Will be also be watching Eastern Europe for clues. Not vastly upwards, I still think the odds are against invocation of either article \u2013 24%, based on the additional risk factors as I am able to assess them at the moment,  with the hope and expectation that this could drift down back down towards (and potentially through) a steadily reducing base rate as the forecast progresses."], [16272, "2018-04-17T18:01:38Z", [0.03], ""], [3317, "2018-04-17T17:27:45Z", [0.05], "It seems like the consequences of incurring NATO's ire greatly outweigh any benefits Russia might gain from unnecessarily provoking the West.

Especially the assessments of UK and USA have influenced Hitler, who by all means was not an adventurist, but received hereby an imagination, that he would be able to finish up USSR very quickly. When the started in 1941 on June 22nd, the German army didn't have proper winter attire, since it was assumed to beat the Soviet army till the cold winter. The end of the story we know. USSR has absorbed 80% of all combat in whole WW2, lost almost 30 millions citizens, but has over come Hitlers army, which was comprised by all European nations and its industries. US, through it's industries supplied Hitler till the end of the WW2 - GM-Opel, as an example.\nTherefore, the risk is evident, that this time the fake image the US media is portraying in regards to the state of military and its economy, the elite may conclude, that Russia will be an easy pray.\nI hope the reason will prevail, and the US elite will understand the suicidal path it will be, if Russia will have to respond militarily.
