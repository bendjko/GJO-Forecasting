Cruz may give up, but if he gets even one success in these three states, especially Indiana, he wouldn't. Not much changes after this primary as Oregon & Washington go to polls, which total up to 72 delegates. Even with that included, Trump may be in 1100-1125 range. In such scenario as well, Cruz wouldn't give up. At any rate, by this time Cruz would have come so far out, that he would likely hold on till the very end. P.S. Best case if Trump sweeps everything, he would stand at ~150-170 delegates more after these two brackets or around the 1150 mark, which if gets crossed, I think Ted Cruz might, just might, give up. Though, having gone all this way, he will most likely go till the very end.

Taking the first error, I have now looked at every forthcoming primary (mainly based on the tools provided by 538 - http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/can-you-get-trump-to-1237/), and ended up consequently focusing solely on the races in Indiana and California, there aren't too many margin of error in the others. On the second error, I am making the new assumption that 1195 is better hurdle, as it should be possible for Trump to convince 43 of the unbound delegates (Pennsylvania could provide at least 20) to vote for him. I wouldn't argue if anyone said it was lower but I figured 1180-1210 is the right range. So going back to Indiana, because of its partial binary nature (wta 30 delegates) and its demographics, if it goes to Cruz, which I think it will, Trump may only get 9 votes which would mean he would need around 122 from California. If DT wins Indiana with say 39 delegates, then he would need around 93 from California.

So the question is more what events could cause him to drop out.  My guess would be cash, a path to victory clearly cut off (not limited necessarily to Trump winning delegates outright), or a personal emergency. Well considering NY primary is today, that's not going to happen.  So I can cross that off the list. The easiest one is the personal emergency: Cruz is young and hale (by candidate standards).  His wife and kids seem healthy too (I can't see how anyone else getting sick or dying who would more than temporarily put him off his ambitions).  I suppose a truck could run over Cruz or something.  Any American's chance in a given year of dying by accident (general accidents, cars, pedestrians, and I'm lobbing in firearmed murder for good measure) is around .06%.  I'm guessing Cruz's chance of that is lower, and even if we doubled his chance of dying in a year to account for the possibility he gets a heart attack, given there's only a quarter of a year left until the convention, that's still way less than 1%. So let's turn to cash.  As of Feb, Ted Cruz has 8 mil cash on hand.  His burn rate even in Feb was just 88%.  Plus (I know it doesn't pay staff expenses) he has 53 odd mil in super pac cash.  He has about 20 days to go before Neb.  And around 45 or so days before California and 89 days until the convention (but after CA, he could probably put a hold on a lot of staff costs).  I'm no expert on campaign finance, but I doubt he'll run out of money.  If I had more time, I would probably try to see how much money other folks had on hand in the past at a similar point in the race to better calibrate how likely he is to run out of money. The only remaining reason to cause Cruz to drop out then is if the path to viability is closed to him.  Cruz has a fantastic ground operation as shown by his delegate pickups in Wyoming and Colorado.  He's focusing hard not so much on winning the remaining states outright (of which his chances are quite low given their favorable demographic and polling advantages for Trump) but rather to decide which individual delegates are sent regardless of who they're (momentarily) bound to.  Trump's staffing rearrangements change this dynamic somewhat since his new staff is much better experienced at securing delegates, but Cruz's team has a time spent advantage over them.  And while actors in DC hate Cruz, grassroots conservatives (the same ones that empowered his grandstanding shutdown in '13 by putting fear in the hearts of his colleagues) generally really like him and are probably more likely to end up in his hand-selected delegate slots.  In other words, Cruz could have an advantage in the rules committee to decide whether or not his delegates are even bound to Trump even on the first ballot.  Those delegates are also less likely to abandon him in favor of an \"establishment outsider\" dark horse.  More importantly, they can give Cruz a massive, friendly platform so that even if the party nominates Trump, Cruz is seen as the natural successor and defender of conservative values vs. Trump's constituents' values to run again in 4 or 8 years (which is by now what I suspect Cruz wants even more: a divisive floor fight where Trump loses might sink Cruz's general election chances) (The field after all is largely, (quite possibly permanently) cleared of other Tea Party darlings like Rubio, Jindal, Walker, and Brownback.  If anything, Cruz's enemy at the convention isn't Trump, it's Paul Ryan since both would be jostling for a future run).  Cruz could pick up platform concessions, party loyalty, even a prominent position in campaigning (or god forbid an administration) all in return for looking like the man who brought party unity.  And if the House and Senate get purged in the meantime, so much better for Cruz so he can continue his one-man obstructionism without having to try to govern. So the only reason to drop out between CA and the convention would be if it were an embarrassment to even show up to the convention (and even then, the aforementioned advantages in his loyal delegates would provide some incentive to anyway).  He probably wouldn't be dinged by the conservative activist base for trying to contest even a \"locked\" convention through the rules committee: after all plenty of them are calling for such maneuvers as a way to salvage House and Senate races.

Some notes on this model: - Until now it has been quite accurate in predicting the number of delegates for Donald Trump. \n- The model doesn't predict that Trump will get his majority before California. So my conclusions from the analysis of 538: a) Donald Trump will not get his 1237 delegates before California\nb) Even with the errors that may occur in the model it is very likely that Trump will get his delegates before the Convention.   So below follows my forecast: NY- 0%\nNEB- 0%\nCA- 0%\nCONV- 70%\nCONV+ 30% Conditions to change my forecast\n- Of course, by relying on 538's model I will have to check on how it performs.

First, Sen. Cruz does have a chance of winning the nomination outright, though it can't be much higher than 0.02 at the moment[a]. Second, he's got 425 delegates, almost 2/3 as many as Mr. Trump[b]. And Sen. Cruz will pick up more along the way[c]. He might even win enough delegates in California[d] to deny Mr. Trump the ability to win 1,237 delegates before the Republican convention. Third, even if Sen. Cruz does not manage either to win the nomination before the end of the primaries or to deny Mr. Trump a majority of the delegates, it makes sense for him to be seen as in play for as long as possible. For he would be the most obvious beneficiary if Mr. Trump were forced to withdraw. And Mr. Trump will be 70 before the convention; no matter how good his health is supposed to be[e], that ain't young. Moreover, as @Anneinak points out, Cruz might yet receive a gift from the Republican Rules Committee[f].  So why might Sen. Cruz leave the race before the convention? One possibility is some sort of debilitating scandal arises. Another is ill health, either his own or that of one of his family members. Without much evidence, I think that these are very low probability events. Yet another possibility is an utterly humiliating loss, a la Marco Rubio in Florida. But Sen. Cruz has already won his home state (handily), and a bad loss (in, say, Utah) would sting but would probably be forgotten in the next news cycle. The only serious obstacle I can see in the possibility of running out of money, and that doesn't seem likely. Cruz has $13.6 million on hand[g]. That's almost as much as Bernie, and nearly an order of magnitude more than Governor John Kasich. So I think Sen. Cruz is in it to the end, bitter or not. -- [a] http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/03/ted-cruz-narrow-path-nomination [b]http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/republican_delegate_count.html [c] http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/23/us/politics/election-results-preview.html [d] http://www.redstate.com/leon_h_wolf/2016/03/10/new-poll-shows-cruz-likely-beat-trump-heads-california/ [e] http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/14/politics/donald-trump-medical-bill-health/ [f] https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/184659 [g] http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/us/elections/election-2016-campaign-money-race.html"], [19106, "2016-03-23T02:26:20Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.41, 0.59], "41% chance of Trump getting to 1237 in a public fashion (either directly or via deal with Kasich - ie not getting the additional 20-30 delegates in backroom deals).
