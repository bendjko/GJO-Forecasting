The height of the killings appears to have been in and after August 2017, which is excluded from this question, and adds to the total estimate of killings which is put around 10,000. However, not only does that number include since the genocide started several years ago, but also does not discriminate between separate campaigns. There appears to be three separate campaigns (depending how EWP considers them, though they appear to be separate) that are made up of the Tatmadaw, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) and the ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) which have systematically targeted civilians. So, this means that EWP will likely only resolve this question as yes if 1,000 civilian fatalities occur in one of these separate campaigns, lowering the probability. Armed groups are also committing non-fatal human rights violations such as severe sexual abuses, burning villages down, and detaining and/or torturing civilians. https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=23575&LangID=E"], [37852, "2018-09-20T15:58:07Z", [0.25], ""], [1333, "2018-09-19T14:46:08Z", [0.11], ""], [60943, "2018-09-18T20:13:59Z", [0.6], "In August of 2017, the Myanmar military murdered an estimated 6,700 Rohingya Muslims in the Rakhine State. In the next 6 months, thousands more were killed and hundreds of thousands displaced. Although the violence has died down in 2018, these events prove how quickly an armed group in Myanmar can perpetrate violence and kill large numbers of civilians. Recent international pressure, including a U.N factfinding mission accusing Myanmar of Genocide, indicate that parties may be deterred from acts of violence in the near future. However, the military maintains its power, acts with impunity, and tensions between religious and ethnic groups remain high. Thus, it is more likely than not that acts of violence against ethnic/religious minorities will resume before June 30, 2019. http://time.com/5187292/rohingya-crisis-missing-parents-refugees-bangladesh/\nhttps://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/2164728/democracy-myanmar-standstill-un-fact-finding-mission-tells "], [691, "2018-09-18T12:29:18Z", [0.05], ""], [34725, "2018-09-16T08:03:54Z", [0.06], ""], [10746, "2018-09-15T14:29:36Z", [0.15], ""], [59882, "2018-09-13T21:25:38Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2018-09-13T12:22:58Z", [0.05], ""], [1333, "2018-09-12T14:57:31Z", [0.1], ""], [1333, "2018-09-11T15:38:54Z", [0.11], ""], [691, "2018-09-11T12:36:13Z", [0.05], ""], [1333, "2018-09-10T20:15:50Z", [0.12], ""], [1333, "2018-09-09T15:03:40Z", [0.13], ""], [1333, "2018-09-08T19:29:47Z", [0.14], ""], [1333, "2018-09-07T14:48:56Z", [0.15], "I thing the polish has worn off the Nobel Laureate is clearly part and parcel with the military at this point and too old to care what the world thinks now that shes the Kingfisher."], [691, "2018-09-06T11:34:35Z", [0.05], ""], [28166, "2018-09-03T20:13:52Z", [0.03], ""], [32300, "2018-09-03T15:00:44Z", [0.07], ""], [60602, "2018-09-02T19:34:33Z", [0.65], "The previous attacks on Rohinga were not a government decision but a popular uprising that was condoned by the authorities in order to keep control.

Another problem in forecasting this issue is finding reliable data.
