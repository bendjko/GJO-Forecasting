IBC is always some months behind, so it's hard to know the current extent of violence in Iraq. In spite of its military defeat, i suspect that ISIS won't be too weak to kill >1.000 civilians. They continue to target shia quartes in Baghdad and prob. do have enough explosives to carry out high-casualty bombing attacks. There will be an election next year. Right now it looks like a Shiite close to Iran will become president. That might result in heigthened tensions between Sunni / Shia that ISIS has been prepping up for quite some time now. Also the shia militas continue to pose a risk, as they are not going to hand over their weapons and did attack Sunni civilians in the past (e.g. burned down whole villages). A major Sunni / Shia conflict is the only way ISIS might survive in the long run. @cmeinel"], [691, "2017-08-26T11:23:20Z", [0.01], ""], [691, "2017-08-25T19:51:18Z", [0.01], ""], [368,
