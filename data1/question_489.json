The Houthis and their Iranian sponsors must have know that such an attack - even an unsuccessful one - would provoke an increased level of retaliation by the Saudis.  Moreover, the apparent consolidation of power by Prince Muhammad bin Salman (an early advocate of the Yemen intervention) and the resignation (forced or not) by Hariri of Lebanon, give the impression that Saudi Arabia may be upping its game against Iran. The Saudi government has used the term \"act of war\" with reference to the missile attack. Here's an article detailing Saudi responses to the attack: http://time.com/5010997/saudi-coalition-yemen-ports-missile/ All of this to say that there may be an escalation of hostilities, at least in and over Yemen. The Iranians insist that the missile launched by the Houthis against Riyadh was locally produced, not shipped to Yemen by Iran. This is obviously nonsense, but if the Iranians gave them the surface-to-surface missiles to hit Riyadh, they almost certainly gave the Houthis the surface-to-air assets to protect them.

This Soviet-made missile is the most advanced long range anti-aircraft system opearated by the Syrian military. Even in this case, it\u2019s old-fashioned in terms of the modern warfare.\nDespite this, the Syrian Defense Ministry said in its statement that government forces responded to the violation of the airspace and \u201cdirectly hit one of the jets, forcing [Israeli aircraft] to retreat.\u201d This statement contradicts to the Israeli claim that \u201cno hit\u201d was confirmed.\nFew hours after the missile incident with Syria, the Israeli media reported that the Israeli Air Force\u2019s F-35 stealth multirole fighter went unserviceable as a result of an alleged bird collision during a training flight.\nThe incident allegedly took place \u201ctwo weeks ago\u201d but was publicly reported only on October 16. However, Israeli sources were not able to show a photo of the F-35 warplane after the \u201cbird collision\u201d.\nFurthermore, it is not clear if the F-35 can become operational again because its stealth coating was damaged. Thus, according to the Israeli version, the warplane reportedly became no longer operational after the bird collision despite the fact that the F-35 earlier passed the bird strike certification with great results (official info here).

This means that I must clarify my interpretation of GJP's cryptic use of \"downed\" here. Seeing that the Jordanian, Bahraini, Moroccan, and Saudi aircraft in the Gulf News example were lost due to mechanical or pilot errors, it is clear that this will count as long as the warplanes were actively participating in an operation. This significantly broadens the field, but there is no clarification if a warplane is counted as \"downed\" while on a training or routine flight, which will skew results. I will continue with the definition as \"downed on operation\" (including error and mechanical failure) and later discuss training accidents.  1. Syria- Already confirmed. This is no surprise as Syria has lost an average of 8-10 planes for every year of the Syrian Civil War. http://www.businessinsider.com/rebel-forces-say-they-shot-down-a-syrian-jet-near-damascus-2017-6 2. USA- In operations in Iraq and Syria in the past decade, the U.S. has lost 30 planes \"downed.\" This number is exclusively from technical failure or pilot error, but does count. While the 30 does include Operation Iraqi Freedom losses, the recent campaign against IS in Iraq and Syria has claimed an average of 1.67 planes/year since 2014. With a more aggressive U.S. posture against IS and the Syrian government, I think a downing of a U.S. plane to be likely in the given timeline. 3. Russia- Beginning operations in Syria in late 2015, Russia has lost 3 aircraft either shot down or crashed. Considering Russia's ongoing operations in Syria and record of 1.5 planes lost/year, I think this is likely.  3a. Turkey- Also operating in Syrian airspace, the Turks have lost only one jet shot down by Syria in 2012. While the Turks are increasing operations against IS and Kurdish groups in Syria, the realignment of Erdogan with Putin should protect Turkish jets from the Syrian air defense. I do not think a Turkish jet will be lost this year unless this informal alliance is broken. 4/5?) Arab Coalition in Yemen- Saudi Arabia, Jordan, UAE, Bahrain, Morocco et. al. \nThis is a very interesting situation, which I think a lot of forecasters are discounting. Since the beginning of the \"Arab coalition\" air campaign in Yemen in 2015, five aircraft from five nations have been downed, averaging two/year. The air campaign, while significantly reduced, has taken casualties after the initial Operation Decisive Storm, so it is safe to say that at least one plane from one coalition nation will be downed this year (in addition to the Jordanian one in the example). The interesting question is if there will be a second one, which is possible based upon current averages.  Therefore, it is likely that 4 or 5 is the most likely forecast, followed by 2 or 3. It is highly doubtful that only Syria will lose a plane this year.  Honorable mentions: If training crashes in the CENTCOM areas are included, Pakistan would definitely count as they have averaged 1.6 crashes/year for the past decade. Iran averages 0.4/year in losses while Omani and Jordanian (non-combat) losses are at 0.3/year.

CAS may need to be conducted during shaping operations with Special Operations Forces (SOF), if the mission requires detailed integration with the fire and movement of these forces. A closely related subset of air interdiction, battlefield air interdiction (AI) denotes interdiction against units with near-term effects on friendly units, but which does not require integration with friendly troop movements. The term \"battlefield air interdiction\" is not currently used in U.S. joint doctrine.\nClose air support requires excellent coordination with ground forces. In advanced modern militaries, this coordination is typically handled by specialists such as Joint Fires Observers (JFO)s, Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTAC)s, and Forward Air Controllers (FAC)s. Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairchild_Republic_A-10_Thunderbolt_II\nThe Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II is a single-seat, twin turbofan engine, straight wing jet aircraft developed by Fairchild-Republic for the United States Air Force (USAF). Commonly referred to by the nicknames \"Warthog\" or \"Hog\", its official name comes from the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt, a World War II fighter that was effective at attacking ground targets. The A-10 was designed for close air support (CAS) of friendly ground troops, attacking armored vehicles and tanks, and providing quick-action support against enemy ground forces. It entered service in 1976 and is the only production-built aircraft that has served in the USAF that was designed solely for CAS. Its secondary mission is to provide forward air controller \u2013 airborne (FAC-A) support, by directing other aircraft in attacks on ground targets. Aircraft used primarily in this role are designated OA-10.\nSource: Wikipedia\n"], [755, "2017-05-25T18:49:30Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.2, 0.05], "Great discussion especially comments by @danbell7819\nI pick 7 countries as having potential for loss: IL, SY, RU, SA, FR, TR, USA\nI see these 5 with the highest probability within the time-frame imposed by this IFP:\nSY (strikes against rebels) \nIL (strikes against Hezbollah targets in SY)\nSA (strikes against Houthis in YE)\nTR (strikes against rebel Kurds)\nFR (strikes against multiple targets in ME and Central Africa)\nAdvanced RU (and PRC) SAM and C3 systems are already operational in the ME (see IR).

Operating under that assumption, and looking at historical data for the Syrian Civil War (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_aviation_shootdowns_and_accidents_during_the_Syrian_Civil_War), I think it's likely that Syria will have another manned, fixed-wing, military aircraft downed before they year is out. I also think it's fairly likely that Russia will lose another aircraft, given they have lost at least one over the past two years. Three countries (the third being the U.S.) seems less likely, especially since recent U.S. losses have been drones. Four or more countries is highly unlikely, and would be more of a fluke than anything else. I recognize that CENTCOM is larger than Syria, but there's not as many opportunities for aircraft downings outside of unpredictable mechanical failures.
