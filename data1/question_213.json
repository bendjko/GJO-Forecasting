A lot of countries are winning medals for the first time ever. This is strictly bad for both dominant nations. Unfortunately it isn't yet clear which one will suffer more. \"Vietnam's Hoang Xuan Vinh secured its first Olympic gold medal in any sport, winning the men's 10-metre air pistol event.\"\nhttp://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-07/vietnam-wins-first-ever-olympic-gold-medal/7698692 3. Australia and Hungary have done very, very well. This prediction now seems very likely. Australia predicted to win a national record 20 gold medals at Rio Olympics by Sports Illustrated\nhttp://www.foxsports.com.au/olympics/australia-predicted-to-win-a-national-record-20-gold-medals-at-rio-olympics-by-sports-illustrated/news-story/95786c84a135644d47542f9eefd925a6?nk=1ae956b71d0c955996d518648f026d0b-1470609053 Even though this is only day 2 and the likely spread between No 1 and No 2 will be a few golds. So how well other countries do is vital since that will tip the balance one way or the other.

I was able to find one prediction from the Australian Olympic Committee that showed China winning, but they also predicted Russia to win in 2008 (Russia ended up placing 4th)."], [25461, "2016-06-29T14:15:47Z", [0.0, 0.2, 0.8, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [25461, "2016-06-29T14:15:18Z", [0.0, 0.21, 0.79, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [12151, "2016-06-29T13:45:08Z", [0.0, 0.85, 0.15, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [26706, "2016-06-29T13:26:25Z", [0.0, 0.2, 0.8, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2016-06-29T12:45:09Z", [0.0, 0.18, 0.82, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [14253, "2016-06-29T01:24:10Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [26680, "2016-06-28T23:34:53Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.85, 0.0, 0.0], "Past performances"], [368, "2016-06-28T21:36:20Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.95, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [26677, "2016-06-28T21:29:40Z", [0.2, 0.05, 0.5, 0.1, 0.15], ""], [26671, "2016-06-28T20:55:28Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.85, 0.0, 0.05], ""], [691, "2016-06-28T20:46:19Z", [0.0, 0.18, 0.82, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [823, "2016-06-28T18:39:46Z", [0.0, 0.35, 0.65, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [25946, "2016-06-28T17:43:49Z", [0.01, 0.06, 0.9, 0.0, 0.03], ""], [83, "2016-06-28T17:11:23Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.9, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [26641, "2016-06-28T12:22:10Z", [0.15, 0.35, 0.25, 0.0, 0.25], ""], [10949, "2016-06-28T11:04:56Z", [0.0, 0.85, 0.15, 0.0, 0.0], "With Russian light-athletes being more or less banned for doping we can easy put their score to zero http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2016/04/16/rio-2016-olympics-medal-table-who-has-most-gold-medals/ Looking at the past Olympics there has been a steady increase in total medals, this year at Rio 301 or up for grabs. And, a host country tend to have good results but 4-8 years later return to old patterns. Australia is a good example and Great Britian will be the next. 2000: 11, 2004: 9, 2008:19, 2012: 29, 2016: maybe with some luck 20, but likely less This brings the question truly between China and USA, whereas the US is pretty consistent: 2000: 37, 2004: 36, 2008: 36, 2012: 46 (English speaking advantage, maybe), 2016: easily above 40. If the Russians are disqualified in track/field events, the USA could get a few more as these are typically good disciplines for them. China, after their own Olympics will be down, plus with heightened control on doping as we saw with the Russians, their unnatural edge will be reduced. Should be below 40. However, without Phelps on the US-Swim team it is likely that less gold will be won, likely all, so 4. Meaning, USA: >40, China: <40. Pretty close to call. I think it comes down to doping, if the Chinese get caught it is the US, if not China. Even the obvious Russian activities took months and years to expose and get a judgment. Likelihood not high. Taking this study into account, based on 2015 performances, China might have the upper-hand. http://sports.ndtv.com/olympics-2016/news/253250-china-on-right-track-to-top-medals-tally-at-2016-rio-olympics-study My guess: USA: 38 China: 42 - 85% China.

Starting with China question the @Enthu link (http://olympicmedalspredictions.com/countries.php) gives what looks like a reasonable baseline of 26 before Badminton and Diving, but they only have China winning one medal in Badminton and zero in Diving (I assume the latter is an error of omission on the part of the website). Its entirely feasible that the Chinese clean sweep both (they got 11/13 in London 2012), but using the 2015 championships for both sports as a rough baseline lets assume 3 for badminton and 7 in diving which brings us to a total of 38 medals - I fully realise all the experts have China on less but I can't really see where I have gone wrong so if anybody has a link to individual medals by sport it would be appreciated. In terms of the trio for Phelps and Ledecky, we will know better by the end of this month after the US Olympic swim trials, but the US team has enough depth that there isn't much reason to go against their forecasted medal win for the moment. The same can be said for Biles whose preparation continues to go well according to all reports. In terms of the Zika virus, I don't think it hurts one country more than the other, but it is something to look out for in case some of the expected medal winners begin to drop out.

The first is a four-year average of Olympic gold performance, and the second is a projection of gold medal winners, based on the current world rankings in each of the 306 gold medal sports.  The four-year average is easy to verify. I picked 1996 as my starting point because it was the first post-USSR/Unified Team competition. After careful consideration I decided to omit 1996 because the results of China, the USA and Great Britain are so different from the four following years, which left the 2000, 2004, 2008 and 2012 Olympic years as my performance baseline. Looking at those years, I looked to see whether gold medal wins or total medal count was more predictive of gold medal success in the following Olympics, and found the r2 correlation was highest with gold-to-gold. My second piece of work is harder to verify. It\u2019s too much to post the projections 306 gold medal events here, but in each case I endeavoured to find the most recent world rankings relevant to each Olympic gold medal event. In each case, I took the ranking leader and assumed that he/she/they would win gold for his/her/their respective country. Here\u2019s what I found:  - USA: four-year average of 39 gold, projection of 36 gold\n- China: four-year average of 37 gold, projection of 37 gold\n- Russia: four-year average of 27 gold, projection* of 20 gold\n- Great Britain: four-year average of 17 goal, projection of 19 gold * Russia may not be allowed to compete in Athletics, which would put two gold medals at risk, but not benefit the other major countries listed here. There was another drop-off from Russia/Great Britain to countries like South Korea, Germany and Australia. As I see it, it\u2019s highly unlikely that any country other than China or the USA wins the event. Russia is a historic power, but the country has dropped from 32 golds in 2000 to 28 in 2004, down to just 24 in 2012. My projections suggest another fall. Great Britain has been very successful at the last two Olympics by its historic standards, but realistically its high-water mark is third place. Some other country may leapfrog the British and the Russians, but surpassing both China and the USA is highly implausible.  The key question here is how to balance China and the United States. Our four-year average gives USA a slight edge, and probably more than that when we consider the bump China got from the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, in which the country won 51 gold. However, the projections very, very slightly favour China.  With that in mind, I\u2019m going to round Russia\u2019s chances up to 1 percent, and give the United States a 50-to-49 percent edge over China. I\u2019m convinced based on recent world rankings and Olympic performance that this is a much closer battle than the consensus on this site would suggest.

Additionally, I've assumed that country's medals are won independently of each other, when in reality, as a country wins a gold medal, it prevents another country from getting that medal. This is to simplify the analysis, but I think the final point remains the same: this should be a pretty straightforward \"win\" for the US. I used Gracenote's 2012 Olympic prediction data [http://www.topendsports.com/events/summer/medal-tally/predicted-2012.htm] to come up with an estimated probability from their 2016 forecasts [http://www.topendsports.com/events/summer/medal-tally/predicted-2016.htm]. Using the 2012 data, I found that the root-mean-square deviation is 6. [sqrt((36-46)^2+(38-32)^2+...)] I'll be using this as the standard deviation for each variable. That means that the difference between 2 groups has standard deviation 8.5. [sqrt(6^2+6^2)] Their 2016 estimates show the following gold medal predictions: USA-42, China-31, Russia-22, Australia-18, GB-17, Germany-15, Japan-12, South Korea-12, France-10, Brazil-9. Thus, P(USA>China)=90%, P(USA>Russia)=98%, and P(USA>Aus, et al.)>99%. That means the US has an 88% chance of beating them all. [.9*.98] P(China>USA)=10%, P(China>Russia)=86%, P(China>Aus)=94%, P(China>GB)=95%, and P(China>Germany)=97%. That means China has an 8% chance of beating them all. P(Russia>USA)=2%, and P(Russia>China)=14%, which already puts Russia under 1%. All put together, Gracenote predicts the USA will have a dominating lead over any other competitor in gold medals and medals overall. The only country that will come close appears to be China. Just as a reasonability check, in London 2012, the US won 46, China 38, GB 29, and Russia 24. In the end, it'll be fun to watch!
