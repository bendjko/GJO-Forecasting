My reading of the polls is that they are still quite close. Trump is only about 1% below the margin of error and in some polls within the margin of error. In most places the total 3rd party (forecast) vote is more than the gap between Clinton and Trump. My understanding is that the 3rd party candidates are just attracting protest votes i,e. those who do not want to vote for either Clinton or Trump. The point of a protest vote is that you don't expect your candidate to win, you just want to show that you don't like the leading candidates.  The fairly high percentage of voters who tell the polls they support a 3rd party candidate shows the percentage of voters who don't want either Trump or Clinton as President. It does not indicate how much they dislike Trump or Clinton. I would suggest that most voters dislike one of the main candidates much more then they dislike the other main candidate. In the polling booth the voter faces a slightly different question to a poll, they have to decide if giving their vote to a 3rd party is likely to help one of the main party candidates become President, or if it will make no difference to who will be President. If they think it will make no difference then they will caste their protest vote for the 3rd Party. If they fear that by making a protest vote they risk allowing the worst main candidate become President they will vote for the least bad main candidate. My guess is that anywhere that poll data indicates that Trump and Clinton are within 4% of each other most of the votes for 3rd party candidates will be transferred to Trump and Clinton.

This means that his poll-predicted result is in the 4-10 percent range. If his result is equally likely to be at any point in that range (what the statisticians call uniform distribution), the probability that he will get at least 5 percent is 5/6 or roughly 83 percent. However, I think the distribution of his chances is not uniform, but more like bell-shaped around 7 percent, albeit with fat tails. Why this may be so:\n - he is consistently polling above 5 percent (in fact, in the 6-8 percent range);\n - Nate Silver gives him about 6-6.3 percent (http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/?ex_cid=rrpromo#plus)\n - with Trump losing support, and doing his best to depress Clinton's support, chances are pretty good that this year the third-party vote would not decline in the last moment as it usually does. Moreover, the presidential elections is shaping not to be too close. This reduces the pull toward the candidates of the two largest parties  - people are less worried about \"wasting\" their vote on a third-party candidate and more likely to use such a vote to protest against the unpopular Trump and Clinton.

Utah was looking especially good for the Libertarians until McMullin announced his candidacy.  If Romney endorses McMullin, that would kill the Libertarian party's hopes in Utah, and seriously impact the Libertarian Party's ability to achieve the 5% threshold. 3)  Yes:  As more and more Republicans declare their inability/unwillingness to vote for Trump, more voters may start looking at 3rd party candidates.   4)  Up until now, the Libertarians and Green were drawing more votes from Clinton (as evidenced by the fact that her margin over Trump was greater when there wasn't a 3rd party option in the poll), but I think that we're going to start seeing that change.

For him to get 5% or more would require another 4% of voters to decide to vote for him. It seems fairly unlikely that many Democrats will suddenly become Libertarians, so it would require that around 8% of Republicans would decide that Libertarian was better than Trump. It seems possible that 1 Republican in 12 could think that almost anyone would be better than Trump, but these non_Trump republicans could not bother to vote at all, vote for Clinton (as the lesser of two evils), or vote for a 3rd party candidate. In some states it seems they could vote for Johnson or McMullin. Neither of them have any realistic chance of winning, so voting for either would count as a protest vote. If I supported a big political party that put up a candidate that I strongly did not like and I wished to register a protest vote, I would prefer to vote for a candidate that had views that seemed to me to match those that I would want my party to have. So a Republican making an anti-Trump protest is more likely to vote for McMullin than Johnson. But McMullin will not be on the ballot everywhere. So putting some numbers down: assume 50% of voters are generally Republican, but assume that many would not vote for Trump. Of those who would not vote for Trump assume that 20% don't vote for any candidate, 20% switch to Clinton, 30% vote for Johnson and 30% vote for McMullin. In order for Johnson to get 5% of the total vote he would need to 4% more of the votes than he got in 2012. This means 8% more of Republican votes, which if he is getting 30% of the Republican protest votes would mean that mean that the total anti-Trump vote by Republicans would need to be around 25% of the total Republican supporters.  For McMullin to get 5% of the total vote would mean picking up 10% of republican voter's support, to get that would require that the Anti-Trump protest by Republicans was around 27% of Republican supporters. Its possible for a political party to lose between 25% and 27% of its votes in one election but its pretty unusual.  But then we seem to be in very unusual times.

But it seems likely that that won't be true for at least 5% of people."], [26573, "2016-06-26T22:09:01Z", [0.65, 0.3, 0.05], ""], [12879, "2016-06-26T20:50:43Z", [0.3, 0.7, 0.0], ""], [26569, "2016-06-26T20:24:44Z", [0.15, 0.82, 0.03], "I think it's very likely - 90%? - that Trump will keep the R nomination. If he doesn't, I'd guess one chance in three he'd just quit, and two chances in three he'd run as an independent. I think if he runs, he's extremely likely - 96%? - to clear 5% of the popular vote. So let's say there's a 3% chance for the first option. For other 3rd party candidates: I presume (95%) that Gary Johnson will run, and presume further (95%) that he will suck, based on his 2012 performance (<1% of the vote). The protest vote in this scenario already has the Donald, so I don't see very favourable circumstances for the Libertarians to get votes. That would be a less than 1% chance for GJ getting 5%. I'm not aware of any other non-mainstream candidates likely to run at present, so let's leave that at 1%, which is rounding up.  The other possibilities would be (i) a Bernie insurgency (seems unlikely given his recent comments, but it's been that sort of year), or (ii) an alternative mainstream R candidate. For Bernie: it'd be a bridge-burning thing to actively stand, but he has very committed fans, and has some eccentricity to him. This is unlikely but not implausible. 4%? Maybe a little generous. I don't know. Tough year to call. For the Reps, I'm not aware of any credible R who's likely to stand, but - you know - Trump. I don't think there'd be much problem for an Alt-R candidate hitting 5% of the vote if they stood, but everyone seems prepared to hold their nose and wait four years for more favourable circumstances. 10%? The likelihood of this could increase if the polls got much worse. Which could well happen. Though it'd be intended to help congressional elections, rather than to win the WH. Let's go 10%. So 10+4+1 = 15%. [EDIT: It occurs to me that both DT and HRC have high unfavourability ratings. This could result either in a lower turnout, or in more votes going to third-party candidates. I still don't think the Libertarian ticket is going to be particularly appealing, but I think I should nudge up their chances by a couple of percent to reflect the greater number of potentially winnable voters. I'll up that from 1% to 3%, so I'd estimate there's a 17% chance of a non-DT third party hitting 5%.]"], [368, "2016-06-26T19:02:56Z", [0.25, 0.75, 0.0], ""], [2965, "2016-06-26T14:15:36Z", [0.01, 0.99, 0.0], "Up 11.\nRCP polls, \nGreen  or llibertarian, too close to call.\nOther than Perot, and Roosevelt  in 2016 and the 3 way Dem s;plit in 1948, none above 5.\nExpect a 50% reduction in  Green and LIber polls.

If we extrapolate that to this year, we should expect them to only cross 2%, as Johnson showed 11% support in a recent survey.

Post-WW2, it's 4 out of 17 presidential elections. Tentatively I set a base rate at about 25%. Switching to the inside view,  the two potential third party candidates to cross this threshold are a) Libertarian Party (presumably Gary Johnson) or b) someone else anointed by conservative elites. The Libertarian Party has been putting up presidential candidates for quite some time, and twice they have hit c.1% (1980 and and 2012) [1].

Also, the rephrasing of this question makes it unclear - I am assuming \"Trump will be among them\" means among the independent/third party candidates, not that he\u00b4ll be among all candidates on the ballot, which is basically guaranteed now... right?"], [691, "2016-05-09T11:38:59Z", [0.01, 0.99, 0.0], ""], [15471, "2016-05-09T09:11:37Z", [0.07, 0.93, 0.0], "Going up a bit due to HR/DT race, which means extremely high unfavorables for both candidates.

Also there is one election, where one candidate scored 4.93% - don't know what to do with this marginal data point, but for the sake of calculation, I will round up my probability upwards to nearest percent rather than down to incorporate this.

One is the primal / conditional point on which the second part depends upon. So to start with, the question is, is there a third candidate? Sanders? Another someone?

Of course, can never rule out an entirely third party or independent candidate. So, let me assign a favourable probability of 3/4ths that there will be a third candidate anyway! P.S 36 out of total 57 elections have actually seen a third or more candidates, which comes to about 64% times.

Taking the first error, I have now looked at every forthcoming primary (mainly based on the tools provided by 538 - http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/can-you-get-trump-to-1237/), and ended up consequently focusing solely on the races in Indiana and California, there aren't too many margin of error in the others.

This is what some GOP folks are preparing to do if no general election candidate receives a majority of the electoral votes\u2014270.  In such a situation, the Constitution requires that the House of Representatives will elect the president, wherein each state would receive one vote regardless of population. Each House delegation would caucus and cast that state\u2019s vote.  32 state delegations are controlled by Republicans. The last time this happened was in 1824.  Andrew Jackson won both the popular vote and a plurality of electoral votes over John Quincy Adams, but two other candidates won enough electors to deny Jackson a majority. Subsequently, the House of Representatives threw the election to Adams.  \"That\u2019s ancient history, but two scenarios could create a similar electoral mess this year. While an independent presidential candidate is highly unlikely to win the election, there is a growing likelihood that such a campaign could prevent either party nominee from winning outright. \"1. Hillary Clinton wins a plurality of electoral votes over Republican nominee Donald Trump, but falls short of the necessary 270. An independent candidate (Rick Perry?) wins a large state such as Texas. House Republicans, repelled by both Trump and Clinton, throw the election to Perry or whoever the independent candidate is\u2014and who finished a very distant third in the voting. (The House can choose from any of the top three vote-getters.) \"2. The Stop Trump movement succeeds in denying him the nomination, instead choosing Ted Cruz or John Kasich in a brokered convention in Cleveland. Trump launches an independent campaign and wins one or more states, a distinct possibility. Clinton wins a large plurality but fails to reach 270 electoral votes. The House elects Cruz or Kasich. \"In either case, the Republican-controlled House, utilizing an arcane provision in the Constitution, subverts the will of American voters and prevents Hillary Clinton from winning the presidency. Farfetched? It\u2019s not hard to imagine a deeply partisan House doing whatever it takes to deny Mrs. Clinton the presidency. \"In 1968 George Wallace won five states and 46 electoral votes. It\u2019s not a reach to envision Trump racking up a similar total in 2016, including typically tossup states such as Michigan or Florida.\n. . . \n\"There are other, even more bizarre possibilities lurking in November.

I will generously say 4%. Mounting a 3rd party campaign is very, very expensive (http://www.vox.com/2016/3/18/11261778/donald-trump-third-party) and Trump has shown no inclination to spend much on his campaign so far, and his ground-game and regional infrastructure sucks. But there is still some chance of a limited third party run.  If he runs, what are the chances he gets 5%? I think this is nearly zero. Getting on the ballot is a huge task in most states, and by the time Trump knows if he's lost the GOP nomination - which will be on June 7 with CA, some of the deadlines have already passed. Even if Trump decided to pursue ballot access he would likely prioritize only a subset of states, reducing the pool of voters that can vote for him. Even existing parties that get on the ballot each year like the constitution party and the reform party only get on the ballot in 15 and 2-5 states respectively. So I think I round this down to 0%, but even a 10% chance, multiplied by the 4% chance of running, rounds down to 0%.  Does one of the other independents - Gary Johnson or Jill Stein - get to 5%? This one has a low base rate - it is relatively unprecedented in modern electoral politics - the most recent example is Ross Perot, who got 19% in 1992 (Ralph Nader in 2000 only got to 3.5%). There are also quite a few parallels there, in the anti-establishment bent of the election. I think a base rate of around 12% is reasonable - that is once every 9 or so elections, or every 35 years. Last election Jill Stein got 0.5%, and Gary Johnson 1.2%, that's also a useful anchor. But this is an unusual election, and both Donald and Hillary are very unpopular. A recent Monmouth poll showed Gary Johnson with 11% support in a poll against Trump and Clinton. I think if Trump wins the nomination, he has a fair chance of getting 5% - say 40% chance. I think the odds are a bit lower with a Cruz nomination (which I put at 64% chance), perhaps only 20%. I will keep monitoring polls and see. Apparently a lot of the support was coming from democrats turned off by Clinton (according to Monmouth), so perhaps we'll see a lot of Bernie voters voting for Johnson and the GOP nominee won't matter so much. So fo now I'll assume 20% chance if GOP nomniee is Kasich or some other random. That makes for .24 *.4 + .76 +.2 = 25% chance. Given the unusual nature of this year's election, a probability twice my assumed base rate seems totally comfortable, and if anything it might be higher. My numbers for probability of getting 5% given certain nominees (20%, 40%) will go up if I see more national polls with Johnson above 5%. I think Jill Stein's chances of getting > 5% are negligible."], [6518, "2016-04-13T03:51:25Z", [0.0, 0.85, 0.15], ""], [12302, "2016-04-13T03:02:04Z", [0.04, 0.93, 0.03], ""], [21, "2016-04-13T01:05:04Z", [0.26, 0.52, 0.22], ""], [17415, "2016-04-13T00:51:39Z", [0.09, 0.89, 0.02], "I don't think Trump will turn into the independent candidate because he has already formed his opinions around the \"Republican\" view.

I used the post-WWII period, since this is the time period most relevant to the current system of political parties in the US (despite the switch of conservatives from the Democrats to Republicans). There have been 17 US presidential elections since WWII, and in 4 of these (1968, 1980, 1992, and 1996) a third-party candidate won more than 5% of the popular vote. This gives a base rate of 23.5% for a third party candidate winning more than 5% of the popular vote. However, we need to adjust this based on the special circumstances surrounding this election, especially with the chance of Donald Trump running as a third party candidate. Currently, prediction markets put the chances of a brokered convention at 63%. Analysis of the delegates at stake by the site fivethirtyeight has shown that Trump is unlikely to win the Republican nomination in the case of a brokered convention.  Now, in the case of a brokered convention, what is the chance of Trump running as a third party candidate? Predictit puts the chance of Trump running as a third-party candidate overall at 28%. However, this includes the probability that Trump will win outright without a brokered convention, so the conditional probability of Trump running, given a brokered convention is 28/63=44%.  If Trump runs as a third-party candidate, he is very likely to receive more than 5% of the vote- an analysis of candidates who left mainstream parties to run as third-party candidates by fivethirtyeight shows that the greatest decrease in polling numbers caused by this shift was a reduction by 2/3 of the overall vote share. Given that Trump is polling much higher than 15% in national polls, there is a very low chance that a shift to a third party run would give Trump less than 5% of the votes. The 28% chance of Trump running as a third-party candidate is averaged with the base rate of 23.5% for any candidate winning more than 5% to get 25.75 ~26%.  What about other candidates? Ben Carson currently has a 3% chance of a third-party run on PredictIt. Another chance is that, in the case of a Trump nomination, one of the Republican establishment (not Ben Carson) decides to mount a 3rd-party run to stop Trump. There might be a 10% chance of this occurring, given a Trump nomination (43% chance on predictit). 0.1*0.43=0.04, or a 4% chance someone other than Ben Carson mounts a 3rd-party run. Bernie Sanders may also run should he lose to Hillary Clinton, but the chance of this is very low (1%).

The first question therefore has a total maximum of 25% in my forecast. Trump himself has indicated he may run as a third party candidate, throwing out his previous pledge, and nothing he has done so far suggests he would respect the party (who likely would have screwed him over a bit in this scenario). I don't know how likely this is, but lets say there's a 50% chance he would decide to consider an independent run, as a naive forecast. Giving us about a 12% chance Trump will try to pursue this. Following that, he would have to get ballot access. For an actual independent run, he would need to do this himself. This would be very difficult. Past third party candidates have been building from mid march. While we may still be about a time when this is just about possible, see - http://ktul.com/news/election/is-it-too-late-for-an-independent-presidential-run-not-quite-yet, that is not the scenario we're really thinking about. The only realistic way Donal Trump doesn't get the nomination is on the convention floor. He's very unlikely to drop out of the republican race and start building his third party run. The convention is in mid July, past the filing deadlines for many states. If Trump does run as an independent, he would therefore have to piggyback on something like the constitution party, I don't think this is especially difficult for him to do, so it really comes down to his choice, but let's knock off another few percent on the off chance he finds this difficult/chooses not to do so, and take it down to 10% that Trump successfully runs as an independent. The Q then is does he get 5% of the vote. There is a reasonable amount of precedent for this, with Ross Perot (twice) and John Anderson both exceeding this in the reasonably recent past. In terms of the hardcore Trump support, who would prefer him to the Republican party candidate, there are probably enough of them. If we say Trump has the support of just under half of the third of the country who are republicans (obv some independent will vote for him as well, but I'm overcounting GOP numbers) then he's got about a 15% ceiling. Now not all of these people would vote for Trump. He may look like a sore loser, and they may be concerned about splitting the vote so rally round the GOP again. Lets say that's another 50% chance. This gives us 5% chance for Trump. Next - will someone else do it. I think the chances of the republicans putting up an anti-Trump candidate are extremely low. If they cared that much they could go nuclear at the conference, we're tearing the party apart either way. More likely, I think, is Gary Johnson.

If we reduce our scope to the last 10 U.S. presidential elections, the 5% bar was cleared three times; it seems fair to say that there's a 24-30% chance of a third-party candidate with at least that much support in a generic election. \nThis, however, is not a generic election. \nThe scenarios I consider reasonably plausible include:\n- Trump winning the GOP nomination, and Republicans turning to a third-party alternative (Rick Perry is commonly mentioned)\n- Trump winning the GOP nomination, and Republicans uniting behind him\n- Trump losing the GOP nomination and running as a third-party candidate\n- Trump losing the GOP nomination and endorsing the party's nominee\nWe might also envision a third-party challenge rising out of a Sanders victory on the Democrat side, but my projections in that race have Clinton winning the nomination with a high degree of certainty, so I'm not going to bother with that.  I currently have Trump with a 54% shot at winning the nomination. There would be considerable pressure to find a third-party candidate in this scenario, due to fears of down-ballot effects if the candidates on offer are Clinton and Trump, but it's far less obvious who that candidate would be; I'm skeptical that Perry (for example) would be a convincing enough candidate to drive up voter turnout on the right. There's also the difficulty of timelines; there is a case to be made for running a right-wing third-party candidate even without a true chance at winning the election but with Trump looking beatable at a convention there's less motivation to act immediately and failing to act immediately will hobble a campaign (the timelines are brutal: http://static.politico.com/4b/2e/f597073c4ba18c25c6b1bc1396a4/independent-ballot-access.pdf).  I'm guessing here; but I'd say 5:1 that the party unites behind Trump or picks a third-party option too late to reach the 5% bar. That puts 9% in the \"someone else\" camp and 45% in the \"no\" box. It seems far more likely to me that Trump would run as a third-party candidate if he fails to secure the nomination. He's created more than enough wiggle room to get out of his loyalty pledge to the party if he fails to secure the nomination and the same factors which prompted a presidential run in the first place would suggest continuing it via a third-party route. I also see little reason to believe that he would hold back in the name of giving the Republican candidate a better chance at winning; Trump has made it clear with both public statements and donation history that he has little interest in putting party goals ahead of personal goals.  That leaves timelines as the key problem for Trump, since he already has an organization, funding and a national profile. Because it's unlikely that his situation will be resolved prior to the GOP convention in mid-July, which will make it too late for 12 states (the 11 above + Missouri) and make it extremely difficult in a number of others. Would he run purely as a protest candidate with no chance of winning?  Again, I'm guessing; I'd call it 3:1 that he doesn't run on a third-party ticket in the event that he fails to secure the GOP nod. That adds 12% to the \"Trump\" box and 34% to the \"No\" box. The timelines are just too tight; he's basically committed at this point to attaining the presidency via a place on the Republican ticket.
