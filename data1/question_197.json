Date: 31. August 2016 um 12:02:44 MESZ Subject: Brazil Senate Impeachment D Day Comment: Beginning 11:00am Brazilian time this morning, the voting session begins. Two senators speak in favor & two against impeachment w/ five minutes being provided to each. Thereafter, nominal voting in electronic panels will be cast. (Footnote 1) Certain Brazilian media sources claim there are ALREADY at least 54 votes to impeach, the minimum number required to carry the Senate motion according to the Brazilian Constitution (2). Caveat on Credibility although it does come from a well followed Brazilian source.  Interestingly, the previously undecided Conservative Senator Antonio Valadares PSB SE signaled his vote to impeach on his presentation yesterday claiming Rousseff had violated various laws which are subject to the impeachment procedure.(3) Conclusion:  PLEASE note : above-mentioned is intended merely as a personal reference in case Rousseff is acquitted, to go back and ask myself \"what was I thinking\".  Rather, what has been fascinating about this \"sorry State of Affairs\" GJ Q will be  a learning experience - for future reference - in financial terms. The contrarian style I carry as baggage through life  w/ me, has seen this impeachment process play out as the final act ...of a bubble of a so-called emerging market...that has been burst.  An impeachment, SHOULD there be one, from my perspective, represents an OPPORTUNITY to take advantage of in terms of boom and bust cycles. BRIC ( Brazil, Russia, India, China) no longer is a well known term today. Rather, \"IN\" is ---- FANG ---- ( Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflex, Google) in the U.S.  Booms & busts tend to have if not identical, then rather similar characteristics.  Brazil, is arguably at the worst  stage of this BUST cycle. Add Impeachment to the cost of the Olympics &, the extreme low point of this cycle is now definable.  In the U.S., for example during the Nixon impeachment proceedings, economic conditions were extreme, as well. Thereafter, post 1974 stock market crash triggered by the collapse of Bretton Woods a major recession took hold. GDP was down 3%, unemployment jumped to 9%. http://www.dividend.com/dividend-education/the-dow-30-a-look-into-the-last-five-recessions/ Both represent interesting lessons & opportunity. There are certain elements in Brazil that suggest, for contrarians, it is time to take a long hard look. Currency depreciation. Brazil is also the most significantly underweighted Country segment for most institutional investors worldwide, for years now.  It sounds strange to say, but another NAIL  in the coffin of this Brazilian BEAR market may well be taken this afternoon/tonight by those Senators who decide on the fate of Ms. Dilma Rousseff.

In her best case scenario, only two Senators would have to change their mind - which seems quite feasible. In the worst case, she would need six more Senators to back her, i.e. 28 in all, to deny her opponents any chance of a two thirds majority (possible, but somewhat more difficult for her). I'd guess she has a 60% chance of avoiding impeachment especially as the opposition is itself in turmoil (Cunha resignation etc). However, she has indicated that she'll call fresh elections if acquitted. As pointed out by @scholarandcat, term limits would bar her from standing in such an election. The question then is whether the election process would be completed in 2016. @praedico has noted that Brazilian presidential elections are typically held in October, and the new President is inaugurated on 01 January, It's thus possible that Dilma won't cease to be President before 01 January 2017 if she (1) isn't found guilty by the Senate, and (2) either doesn't call an early election, or does call it in October and her successor is inaugurated on 01 Jan 2017 in accordance with previous practice. My guess is that there's at least a 40% chance of Scenario 2 occurring. The chance of her remaining President would thus be 0.6*0.4 = 24%"], [231, "2016-07-11T02:46:45Z", [0.75], ""], [6303, "2016-07-11T01:30:18Z", [0.95], "I am forecasting based on the general news reports and GJP consensus.

Rio state declares financial emergency, requests funding for Olympics\nhttps://www.yahoo.com/sports/news/rio-state-declares-financial-emergency-requests-funding-olympics-005430624--oly.html RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Rio de Janeiro\u2019s governor declared a state of financial emergency Friday and requested federal funds to help fulfill obligations for public services during the Olympics that start Aug. 5.  Emergency measures are needed to avoid \u201ca total collapse in public security, health, education, transport and environmental management,\u201d a decree in the state\u2019s Official Gazette said. The state\u2019s revenue, largely tied to the petroleum industry, slumped in the last two years as global oil prices collapsed.  The announcement followed this week\u2019s visit to Rio by Brazil\u2019s Interim President Michel Temer, who said the federal government would ensure all obligations are met for a successful Games. Rio is expecting about 500,000 foreign visitors during the Olympics, which has coincided with Brazil\u2019s worst recession since the 1930s and a political crisis that last month led to the suspension of President Dilma Rousseff. \u201cThe state\u2019s financial emergency in no way delays the delivery of Olympic projects and the promises assumed by the city of Rio,\u201d Mayor Eduardo Paes said on Twitter. He also underscored that legacy construction projects, with the exception of an 8.79 billion-real expansion of Rio\u2019s metro that is expected to be finished just days before the Games open, are the responsibility of the city and that most have been completed.  The local organizing committee for the Games said the state\u2019s fiscal situation did not impact its actual running of the Olympics, which relies entirely on private funds. While the majority of Olympic infrastructure costs have been spread across city, state and federal budgets, with some financing from private companies, the state is responsible for most day-to-day security and health services in Rio. The financial pinch resulted in a 30-percent cut in the state\u2019s security budget - just as Rio has seen a jump in homicides and assaults in recent months, raising concerns about safety ahead of the Olympics. The state of Rio expects a budget deficit of over 19 billion reais ($5.56 billion) this year as spending planned before oil prices fell outstrips revenue that is tumbling during Brazil\u2019s recession. Rio state\u2019s debt has been downgraded several times.  On Wednesday, Fitch Ratings downgraded Rio\u2019s debt rating to \u2018B-\u2019 from 'B+\u2019, saying the state was suffering \u201ca fast-deteriorating liquidity position.\"  Since late last year, the state has been forced to delay pension and salary payments and shutter some schools and hospitals, where crucial supplies, including medicines and syringes, are lacking.  Brazil is also facing an outbreak of the Zika virus, which has been linked to the birth defect microcephaly in which babies are born with abnormally small heads frequently associated with developmental issues.

A long shot given that negotiation between the Workers' Party and many other parties is possible."], [24973, "2016-06-04T00:09:24Z", [0.38], "Since the start of the New Republic in Brazil, out of the 5 presidents (not including Rousseff), only 1 has been impeached so my baseline estimate is at 20%. Why would Rousseff be impeached?  Rousseff\u2019s approval ratings have dropped tremendously over the past two years as Brazil has slipped into economic turmoil, but that doesn\u2019t exactly have anything to do with impeachment so I don\u2019t change my probability.  Rousseff has now been suspended from office and awaits her trial. Rousseff\u2019s trial has not started, but she has been suspended from office and from that date she has 180 days to be convicted of corruption, more specifically, covering holes on the national budget by shifting funds.\n\tWith that I increase my probability by 2-5% because she is being accused of violating fiscal laws. \nIf she is not convicted by those 180 days then she will assume her position again. Because she has now made it this far into the last stage of the impeachment process, I increase my estimate 30% putting me at 55%. \n\tI say this because there is now only a two-thirds vote that stands between her and her position, and I feel that by making it through all of other phases of the impeachment process, there is not as much inhibiting her impeachment.  In order for her to be convicted, 54 out of the 81 senators need to vote \u201cyes\u201d. If at least 54 senators all vote yes arbitrarily, there is a 1% chance of that happening so I increase my estimate by one. 56% Obviously, senators\u2019 decisions are not arbitrary as they are all part of a political party and therefore they will vote based off of their party ideals, etc\u2026 Of the four major parties in power, PT has 11 seats in the senate, PMDB has 18, PSDB has 11, and DEM has 4.\n\tBecause Cunha is one of Rousseff\u2019s largest critics, I think that most of PMDB senators would vote for the impeachment which is 18 out of the 54 needed. \n\tPTB did not support Rousseff in the elections so I would guess that it\u2019s 3 senators would vote for impeachment. That is now 21 1of 54 needed. \n\tPSDB is known as an antagonist to the worker party which adds 11 more senators putting it at 32 of the 54 needed. \n\tPP supports the impeachment of Rousseff so that adds another 6 senators, adding up to 38 of 54 needed. \n\tDEM is in the Change Brazil coalition which is a rival against Rousseff\u2019s coalition, so I would assume that it\u2019s senators vote for impeachment, adding 4, which leaves 42 of 54 needed. \n\tI don\u2019t have the time right now to look up more of this data but assuming I am correct with the above data, I don\u2019t think it would be that difficult for those against Rousseff to recruit a few more senators to vote for the impeachment. \n\tThus, I raise my probability by 10%, yielding 66%.  Why Rousseff wouldn\u2019t be impeached? It\u2019s possible that the trial does not finish before the 180 days in which case she would go back into office. Lower my estimate 2-5%. Americas Society/Council of the Americas quoted a Eurasia Group research note cited in an Associated Press article stating that \u201cEven though support for Rousseff's removal may grow, the pro-impeachment factions in Congress are far from the two-thirds majority needed to approve the motion in the plenary\u201d. But this was in December of 2015 so things easily could have changed since then. With this I lower my probability by 2-5%. Also stated by an article in AS/CA, Rousseff can also point out that there could be a lack of tangible evidence which would slow the trial and she could also delegitimize Cunha which could possibly stop the trial process. With this I lower my probability by 2-5% If Rousseff is voted to be impeached, she can appeal the trial. This would have to be on the basis of legal violations. I don\u2019t know anything about the Brazilian court system so I am going to estimate that it is not common that cases get appealed so I lower my probability by about 2-5%. As stated in a new article released on June 1, recordings have been released by the government that may undermine those opposed against Rousseff. Romero Juca and Fabiano Silviera both resigned from their Cabinet positions because they were caught making statements about wanting to stop the corruption inquiries. Silviera was also caught helping his allies avoid punishment. Also, the leader of the Free Brazil Movement, was caught making statements about how his political activist group received support from political parties to promote pro-impeachment rallies(LA Times).\n\tWith this information I decrease my estimate by 5-8% because although this is important information I don\u2019t see it as being a strong suggestion that Rousseff will not be impeached. \n\tThis leaves me with a 38% that Rousseff be impeached.  For further review:  Marcelo Odebrecht, one of the country's most powerful businessmen, signed a plea-bargain deal after his construction company was accused in the Petrobras scandal. Soon he will obviously implicate some people of which may be important for this question (LA Times).

Thus far, only about half of the Senators have spoken, so the debate is expected to go on all night. Meanwhile, outside there's about 5k protesters, 4k of whom are reported to be Rousseff supporters. By early Thursday morning, it is expected that a vote will have been taken on the motion to begin an impeachment trial.  (@zettel314, it may interest you to know that the man who brought the charges against Rousseff is the man who successfully brought charges against the President of Brazil in 1992.)  Rousseff is widely expected to lose that vote.  If the vote passes, a trial will begin in the Senate.   This trial must be completed in 6 months, during which time Rousseff will be suspended, but not out of office.  She will only be out of office if, after the trial, the vote goes against her, or if the trial process is not completed in the 6 months allowed by the Constitution. @sevedb,  I've read that Temer (the current VP who will be acting Pres if an impeachment trial begins) has been accused of WORSE crimes than Rousseff.  Rousseff has already outlasted many of her enemies--most recently Cunha, the previous leader of the House, who was tripped up by his own legal troubles; she may outlast Temer, too!  The popular former president \"Lula\" supports Rousseff, however, it's unclear how much he can help her because he has his own legal problems, too! In a patronage system, a president \"makes friends\" by distributing \"favors\".  Rousseff has had plenty of time to \"make friends\".  Everyone  knows who these friends are--they will be the losers if Rousseff is found guilty of the impeachment charges--so they will fight like heck to help her defeat the charges of impeachment so that they can continue to enjoy the perks of being a friend of the Rousseff, the President.  Rousseff, freed of the duties of office, will have 24/7 to plot and plan her defense with her friends.  She has already said that she will use every legal tactic that she can (and we have seen that she is very capable of doing a good job of delaying things!).

Nevertheless, these were both true at the time of the impeachment vote in the Chamber of Deputies, and that still ended up close and from what I remember people were far from certain at the time it would happen. The fact that it did happen despite the uncertainty does of course reveal a lot of information, but I can't help feeling like there is some hindsight bias if you think on this basis getting a guilty vote in the Senate is now a dead cert) If there are the votes to find her guilty, it happens in 2016: 93%->97% (based on new info above about base case timeline, and on my own reflection that there is a very strong incentive to find her guilty (if they can) before the Olympics) If she is found guilty in 2016, she can by some means hang on to office until 2017: 5% -> 1% (as far as I can tell, a Senate vote for guilty would definitely remove her from office. The 1% uncertainty is if (say) the Court were to reinstate her, would that count as her having briefly \"ceased\" to be President? Or if there was some sort of coup?

She will get 6 months to present her case if she faces impeachment, and meanwhile create a defence. This will be a murky one. Lucky for us, six months is well within the timeline of the question. So, I need to bump up my initial assessment - the question also extends to - will Rousseff not successfully defend herself if impeachment starts. So within the remaining 25 probability points, I take a further 2 on 3 odds that she will be unable to defend herself. Hence, taking up my probability by a further 2/3 * 25 = 17 points.

It\u2019s very difficult to set a base rate here, there has only been one impeachment in Brazil (1992, successful). There was one impeachment of a president in Paraguay (2012), which was also successful. Both were significantly closer to unanimous than the initial impeachment of Rousseff.  There have been two impeachments of US Presidents, Johnson and Clinton, both were highly acrimonious, partisan proceedings and resulted in acquittal. Nixon resigned before Congress had the chance to impeach him, I think we can safely assume he would have been found guilty, and I would say there is a good case to add him to the sample. Impeachment processes are, I believe, relatively similar across all these countries. It is rather time-consuming to get the data for this. I don\u2019t really know what to conclude here, other than my impression is that the successful impeachments (especially Brazil 1992 and Paraguay 2012, and if we were to include Nixon) were much closer to unanimous. I would be very interested if anyone could put together a better dataset for impeachments of heads of states in countries with similar processes to Brazil. Verdict: without doing much more work, I can\u2019t really have anything other than an extremely weak prior.   Switching to the Inside View: I am not sure the previous successful impeachment in Brazil tells us much \u2013 impeachment vote was significantly more overwhelming, President resigned before being found guilty (which he was, after resignation). You can read about it here (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Collor_de_Mello#Corruption_charges_and_impeachment), but I struggle to fund anything useful. As for these proceedings, I think there is a 99% probability there will be a trial, starting very soon. Timeframe: there is a time limit of 180 days after impeachment before the suspension of office ends. So it seems like the timeframe for 2017 is definitely on... but, let me quote para 2 of Article 86 of the Brazilian Constitution \"Paragraph 2 - If, after a period of one hundred and eighty days, the trial has not been concluded, the suspension of the President shall cease *without prejudice to the normal progress of the proceeding*.\" (*My emphasis*) The 180 days appears not to be a deadline for the end of the trial, just the suspension from office. So the trial could conceivably continue into 2017, especially if it is uncertain whether they have the votes. How likely is this to happen? I wouldn't want to bet on much less than 5-10%. Conditional on Rousseff being found guilty in a trial, I'm going to start with a 93% chance it happens in 2016.  How likely is she to be found guilty? I've taken the 81 senate seats (per the list here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Senate), and taken the % of votes to impeach by party in the Chamber of Deputies from here (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_process_against_Dilma_Rousseff),assigning a 90% probability for voting to impeach by the three \u201cnon-aligned\u201d given two of them recently left PT (Rousseff\u2019s Party) and one PDT (another left wing Party that was giving support to Rousseff at the time) on seemingly acrimonious terms and one of them indeed is responsible for providing evidence against Rousseff  (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-36211526), and a 70% probability to the PTC member who is recently ex-PTB, of which 70% voted to impeach. Doing all that gets you to 58.9 votes, or c.5 more than the required 2/3. That seems very tight to me, but much more likely they have the votes than not. For now, I\u2019m going with 80%. Multiplied with 93% it happens in the forecast period, with 99% probability of there being a trial, that\u2019s c.74%.  Other factors: she could resign/flee. I consider it highly, highly unlikely she would do so unless she was near-certain of being found guilty \u2013 so mostly this is co-extensive with \u201cguilty\u201d having the votes, and I\u2019ll add 1% onto the forecast for this - so 75%.      She could also be assassinated, or something else I haven\u2019t thought of that is \u2018outside the model\u2019. Another 1% for that puts me up to 76%.  Despite the chain of reasoning, my forecast is currently still substantially driven by the probability of there being the votes to find her guilty, but absent more information it just seems like it is much closer than a 90%+ probability would imply.
