All station facilities were shut down, the buildings were abandoned and later reconstructed to become what is now the University of Information Science. At its peak during the Cold War, the facility was staffed by over 1,500 KGB, GRU, Cuban DGI, and Eastern Bloc technicians, engineers and intelligence operatives. In 2000, it was reported that China signed an agreement with the Cuban government to share use of the facility for its own intelligence agency. The base was closed in 2001.

The original site has been reused since so that would add to the cost of reopening it. And with a friend in the White House (from 20th Jan) does Putin want to stir up the US Congress that presumably still has some members who are not as keen on Russia as Trump, and as Trump is not a fan of the Cuban government why would Putin want to remind Trump that Russia and Cuba are friends.

As we learned during the Cold War, Cuba is another strategic place to plant a foreign military base. It has taken Washington decades to normalize its relations with Havana as a long-term insurance strategy to keep the island out of adversarial foreign hands.

Not sure what exact stats are, but this facility has been closed since '01.  The RT article in qn description w/ rumor base is re-opening is from May '15 and obviously hasn't happened yet.  Even assuming Russia would like to reopen the center, what are the odds it happens in any given 12 mo period (I don't know - but has to be <33% in this one example, even if we assume the base does in fact re-open in 2017).  I'd guess it's really more like 10-20% or something even assuming that the Russian intent to re-open is there. 2)  Related to point 1, if it does re-open, what are the odds we get definitive evidence that it has?  Again, I don't know, but I assume even the Trump administration would frown upon such a step (and may not publicly admit that it has allowed it to take place even if internally it knows Lourdes has re-opened), so we may be left in the dark w/ only rumors and no official confirmation (from either side) even in the bull case where base reopens.  I don't have an exact factor, but will say 50-50 shot that if base indeed re-opens that we get definitive public confirmation in the same year. 3) Finally (and most importantly?), given advances in technology, how relevant/useful is a radio signal listening center like this?  I honestly don't know, but we have abundant public evidence of Russia's current intelligence gathering (and influencing) activities in the united states.  It seems to me they can get their hands on quite a lot of useful information without a base like this.  How much can you really learn anymore with one of these stations?  I would imagine most military/intelligence communications are encrypted and not vulnerable to interception.  Most public / unprotected communications can fairly easily be found out by anyone with the will/resources from abroad, so does that lower the value of a station like this?  I'm not an expert.  I'll try to learn more and update, but for now just leaving this as a percentage factor that there's a chance (will start at 50-50) that those with an intelligence background would say a station like this is of low value today (and thus much lower probability they will re-open). So approx math I'm starting with is:  ~20% base rate it happens in 2017 (assuming russians want the base) x 50% chance Russians actually even want the base that badly x 50% shot of public confirmation if base opened = 5%. To play devil's advocate against myself, best argument I could see for other side is that my base rate math is flawed, since 2017 might be a particularly good year for russia to try to re-open. It isn't going to be easy for Trump to call Putin on stuff without looking wrong (or weak) which he won't do.  If Putin opens the base, what is Trump really going to do about it?  Hard to see him totally reversing course and taking a hardline against Russia.  More likely he just brushes off and says it doesn't matter (or possibly just deny that it is open, per my point 2).  So, anyways, I feel fine about my 5%, but do acknowledge that the base rate formulation could be a flawed way to look at it since all years are not equal."], [16272, "2016-12-20T19:08:14Z", [0.11], ""], [12879, "2016-12-20T18:54:15Z", [0.3], "I will have to go with a SuperForecasting \"Probably Not\"option of happening based on the increased relations established between the USA and Cuba in 2016."], [28336, "2016-12-20T18:24:37Z", [0.1], ""]]}
