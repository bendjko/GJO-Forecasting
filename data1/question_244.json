Maybe after a multi-year investigation something arises that suggestions they were deliberate)\n-Rough estimate for mass killings due to air strikes is 2.25% (45% x 5%) The Houthi siege leading to food/medical supplies failing to arrive and this leading to mass killings  is another possibility.\n-Houthi siege leading to food/medical supplies failing to arrive by 1/1/17: 90% chance. The aid situation is dire in Yemen and it seems likely that some aid, somewhere will fail to arrive due to Houthi activities\n-This failure leads to 1,000 or more civilian deaths: 10%. Only 1/3 of civilian deaths have been attributed to the Houthi siege. It is a possibility that their activities will lead to an event that directly results in 1,000 civilian deaths, but given that the average rate of civilian deaths linked to the Houthi reaches roughly 500 deaths by 1/1/17, it seems there is an outside chance that their actions result in 1,000 or more deaths. We would have to have the standard deviation of deaths to be roughly 400 for there to be a 10% chance. \n-If an event like this did happen, however, i think there is a good chance that it get classified as a deliberate mass killing: 75%\n-Rough estimate for mass killings due to Houthi is 6.8% (90% x 10% x 75%) Other sources of mass killings\n-The recent examples of mass killings seemed to involve a stronger power oppressing dissenters with violence.  This does not seem to fit the description of the Houthi. The Houthi have not gained enough power yet and they seem to be fighting against the rich and powerful, so resorting to deliberate mass killings in the traditional sense (shooting into a crowd of protesters, or torturing opposition) don't seem likely. If they were able to gain majority control, then maybe this would be likely.\n-The current government and Saudi coalition seem to be sticking with air strikes as their primary course of action.
