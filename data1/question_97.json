One example of an excessive step might be interfering with Russian internet messaging (para 1-3). In past cases, administration officials have decided to publicly blame North Korea and indict members of China\u2019s military for hacking because they decided the net benefit of public shaming \u2013 and increased awareness brought to cyber security \u2013 outweighed potential risks (para. 13).\nIn past cases, administration officials have decided to publicly blame North Korea and indict members of China\u2019s military for hacking because they decided the net benefit of public shaming \u2013 and increased awareness brought to cyber security \u2013 outweighed potential risks (para. 13). But determining an appropriate response to Russia's actions has proven more complicated in part because Russia's cyber capabilities are more advanced and due to fears about disrupting other geopolitical issues, such as the civil war in Syria. Obama may choose to invoke an April 2015 executive order that empowered him to levy sanctions in response to cyber-attacks perpetrated by foreign groups targeting infrastructure, such as transportation, or done for economic purposes. [One option, said a U.S. government official who has participated in discussions on possible retaliation, would be leaking material on Russian officials or actions that the United States already has obtained in a way that would \u201cparallel what the Russians did, but be impossible to prove\u201d]. The official compared that option to Russian military and civilian intelligence agencies providing hacked material to the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks and trying \u2013 unsuccessfully, the official said \u2013 to cover their tracks (para. 13-17).

Nor does it include general assistance with the electoral process, such as election monitoring.\nLevin defines intervention as \u201ca costly act which is designed to determine the election results [in favor of] one of the two sides.\u201d These acts, carried out in secret two-thirds of the time, include funding the election campaigns of specific parties, disseminating misinformation or propaganda, training locals of only one side in various campaigning or get-out-the-vote techniques, helping one side design their campaign materials, making public pronouncements or threats in favor of or against a candidate, and providing or withdrawing foreign aid.\nIn 59% of these cases, the side that received assistance came to power, although Levin estimates the average effect of \u201cpartisan electoral interventions\u201d to be only about a 3% increase in vote share.\nThe U.S. hasn\u2019t been the only one trying to interfere in other countries\u2019 elections, according to Levin\u2019s data.

From that flows the biggest misperception, which is that we operate outside of oversight, outside of legal and policy constraints. The reality is that we have extensive interaction with Congress, particularly with our oversight committees in the House and the Senate. We are on a daily basis sending written congressional notifications about significant intelligence activities\u2014things we\u2019ve done well, things that have gone badly and new initiatives that we are undertaking. There also is a misperception that we dream up covert action programs and execute them outside of any tether to the rest of the administration, which is just not true. Covert action programs are the president\u2019s programs. They start with a presidential finding that defines the objective and the authorities we can employ. There is a lot of back and forth about the operation of covert action with the president and the president\u2019s staff.\" The Cipher Brief, December 4, 'An Open Letter to the CIA Director Nominee': https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column/agenda-setter/open-letter-cia-director-nominee-1091\nClips from the Cipher article:\n\"You must refocus the Agency on what makes it unique and codified in Executive Order 12333:  the aggressive, clandestine collection of intelligence.  The CIA must not be the intelligence version of the Salvation Army bell ringer, where we stand and wait for information to be deposited into the kettle for subsequent analysis.  The operational role of CIA is unique in the U.S. Government, and as former colleague and Cipher Brief Network member, John Sipher said, some information may never be given nor shared, and we must use the tradecraft of espionage to acquire it in order to inform policy.  You will have to assess whether the homogenization and pasteurization of functions under Modernization has eroded this nationally-critical ethos.   I believe it is possible we have dulled the edge on our operational knife, and you must return clandestine operations to its position as a top priority for the entire Agency.   The Agency must do a better job at collaboration and cooperation within the IC and with other agencies, departments, and institutions important to the Agency\u2019s mission. I recommend you pay particular attention to the Agency\u2019s relationships with the operational and intelligence organizations of the Department of Defense.  As the scale of major combat shrinks, the opportunities for DoD civilians and warriors to serve together with a shared mission will also shrink.  Shrinking with it will be the instinct to cooperate and collaborate, which will be necessary as CIA and DoD elements operate together across the globe.  You should also look at whether CIA has the right relationships with academia, think tanks, and the national laboratories.  As I stated earlier, the magic of CIA comes from the magicians not the institution.  To grow this magic, CIA must have a diverse workforce in order to be relevant and effective.  The current Agency leadership has put a priority on diversity for its leadership, followership, and recruiting of talent from across the nation, which has set the example within the IC and the U.S. Government.  You must continue this momentum and invest in every opportunity to acquire the diverse skills, talent, imagination that the Agency will need to face the challenges of the future. There is another sensitive issue within CIA and that is its dependence on contractors.  Since 9/11, CIA has seen a necessary growth in the number of contractors it has needed to perform functions as diverse as the functions within the Agency itself; we had no choice as we had a critical mission to do, and we needed the capability to do it. In the spirit of full disclosure, I have been extremely well served in all four of the stations I have had the honor to be the Chief.  Contractors have not only provided critical operational, technical and support services to my stations but many of my contractors were former senior members of the Directorate of Operations and their mentorship, coaching and wise counsel served me exceptionally well.  That said, it will be enlightening and useful for you to ask for an inventory of the contractor workforce within the Agency.  In the aggregate, you will find they are the \u201chidden directorate\u201d and comprise a significant portion of the overall workforce.  What this should tell you is a story not of fraud/waste/abuse, but a clear message that the Agency remains dangerously too small for the mission it has been given.  CIA will need your Congressional experience and relationships on the Hill to help grow the number of employees to better match the mission obligations.

Too late, I realized that nobody is going to want to sanction some other country for doing what they themselves are doing.  Too late, I realized that what sanctions may be imposed may be done sub rosa. Some weeks ago on Stephen Colbert, Lose-lips Biden promised there'd be sanctions.  When Colbert asked Biden if we'd know about them when they were imposed, Biden said, \"I hope not\".  In yesterday's press conference, Obama said essentially the same thing. Between lack of clarity about the resolution criteria and the stated intention that the public would not know about when sanctions were imposed, even though I am totally convinced that there have been punitive, retaliatory actions taken that I would argue are sanctions, I think that GJO is going to say that this question resolved as \"No\".

That is a very strong statement. Further, since it is unclear what, if anything, Trump would be willing to do, there is still a chance that Obama will take it on himself; he's made a number of big moves in the last year as he tries to leave his mark. I don't think it is impossible that he would do something in the coming weeks.  Conversely, sanctions take significant political weight. The US is very divided, even on this hacking issue, and Obama may not get the support to impose sanctions on Russia in the coming weeks. It is more likely that \"retaliation\" will be something more covert, something that Trump may not even realize is happening if he continues to ignore his intelligence briefings; this would be something Obama could make happen without political support.  Note, also, that this question isn't limited to just the US/Russia affair.

At that point, cyber was not in any specific countries sanctions list, though was a coverall E.O.  Sony hack was known and HR757 was in play against NK.  My view was that if 757 became law, if it included a prohibited activity referencing cyber this would count as a sanction.  Well 757 became law, EO 13722 (https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/nk_eo_20160316.pdf) was published March 15, 2016 and this now specifically prohibited transaction with NK due to it having engaged in significant activities undermining cybersecurity.

OFAC agrees (https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/nkorea.pdf) that under \"E.O. 13722 blocks the property and interests in property of the Government of North Korea and the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea... for ... engaged in significant activities undermining cybersecurity\", but prohibited activities it turns out are not sanctions (for this q) and so this didnt count (section V of OFAC seemingly takes a different view, which was my view, but did not to resolve this q).  It seems to be have been successfully argued this is a framework and not an actual sanction, whereby to trigger a yes an individual or organisation in addition to the Government of NK needed to be blocked and added to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN List) to count.

The arrest of Mr. Nikulin provided a look at the shadowy world of Russian hackers, who appear to operate with relative impunity even as they are accused of escalating attacks on computer networks in the United States. They are accused of attacking a long list of targets, including retailers, banks, energy companies, and more recently, the Democratic National Committee. Hackers have been able to operate in Russia with little concern about getting arrested, security experts and law enforcement executives say, so long as they do not attack targets inside Russian borders. But they risk arrest when they leave the country. In 2014, for example, a hacker was arrested in Guam and extradited to the United States for accessing cash register systems at American retailers between 2009 and 2011. A federal jury convicted that hacker, Roman Valerevich Seleznev, of 38 counts of hacking-related charges in August. He is awaiting sentencing. The grand jury indictment, which was unsealed on Friday, accuses Mr. Nikulin of hacking into the computer networks of the three companies, damaging the computers of LinkedIn and Formspring employees, and using their credentials for further intrusions. He is also accused of conspiring with unnamed co-conspirators to traffic in user credentials stolen from Formspring, a social networking site. He faces three counts of computer intrusion, two counts of causing damage to a protected computer, two counts of aggravated identity theft, one count of trafficking, and one count of conspiracy. Mr. Nikulin could face more than 30 years of prison and more than $1 million in fines. The charges were announced on Friday by Brian J. Stretch, a lawyer at the Justice Department, and John F. Bennett, a special agent in charge with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Mr. Nikulin, who goes by the online aliases Chinabig01, Dex.007, Valeriy.krutov3 and itBlackHat, was captured in a raid at a hotel in central Prague on Oct. 5. The arrest came 12 hours after authorities there learned he was in the country with his girlfriend and driving a luxury car, according to local police. He did not resist arrest, but had medical problems and was briefly hospitalized, the police said in a statement. The raid was conducted in collaboration with the F.B.I. after Interpol issued an arrest warrant for him. Mr. Nikulin\u2019s arrest came two days before the Obama administration formally accused the Russian government of stealing and disclosing emails from the Democratic National Committee and other institutions and prominent individuals. Federal officials, including Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., have said that the United States would respond to the Russian attacks in kind. After the Czech police arrested Mr. Nikulin, the Russian Embassy in Prague called for his release. Aleksei Kolmakov, spokesman for the embassy in Prague, was quoted by the state-run Russian news agency Tass as saying, \u201cWe insist that the detained Russian citizen should be transferred to Russia.\u201d A judge in Prague ordered Mr. Nikulin to remain in custody and a court to examine whether to extradite him to the United States.

However, analysts say that Russia seems less concerned than China by the cost to its reputation over US anger at cyber intrusions. \"The Obama administration is likely to prepare financial sanctions as part of its response to the election hacking but might find it difficult to garner international support. European officials say that it is hard enough maintaining support for Ukraine-related sanctions.\n~~~~~~~\nhttps://www.lawfareblog.com/us-cyber-deterrence-strategy-more-russian-roulette \"Yesterday\u2019s news that the White House plans to issue a \u201cproportional\u201d but possibly secret response does not actually indicate whether any decision has been reached regarding what sort of response we can expect and when. If anything, the statement indicates a continuation of the same policies. The Administration used nearly identical language when vowing to respond to North Korea\u2019s attack on Sony (where the ultimate visible response was sanctions) and similar terms in pledging to retaliate against the Chinese for the OPM breach (where there was ultimately no visible US response, though China did arrest individuals it claimed were responsible). \"It\u2019s easy to be skeptical. Adversary nations continue to engage in significant malicious cyber activity against the United States. The only visible response from the US is a Name and Shame strategy of sanctions and indictments, which is applied sporadically and with mixed results. Name and Shame is purportedly augmented by \u201cproportional\u201d retaliatory cyber operations, but the secrecy and vagueness surrounding those prevent any meaningful assessment, raise questions as to whether adversaries even receive the intended message, and cannot deter outside groups who might be watching. \"The unpleasant truth is that each of these episodes raises the spectre that the US still does not know when or how it will respond. Since the fundamental questions of deterrence policy appear to be unanswered, one wonders whether the US has any meaningful strategy at all. Or rather, if we have any strategy beyond playing it by ear.\n. . .\n\"The present conflict again highlights the initial question where to draw the line: when is an attack serious enough to merit a response? There is a great deal of activity that occurs in this realm on a daily basis that does not even warrant the investment of time and resources to figure out who is responsible. The fundamental issue is determining where a given action, or course of conduct, fits on the scale. The timing of the official attribution in this case\u2014more than four months after initial reports of Russian involvement\u2014and the Administration\u2019s own stated policy may offer some hints as to where on that spectrum it places the DNC hacks and electoral system intrusions.\n. . .\n\"Broadly speaking, attempts to interfere with the election qualify as \u201ccyber activity intended to cause significant disruption to the normal functioning of U.S. society or government.\u201d As early as July, intelligence officials had \u201chigh confidence\u201d that the Russian government was involved in intrusions into the DNC and other political organizations, which resulted in the leaks of large quantities of internal emails. But the administration elected not to publicly respond or confirm attribution at that time, despite calls from commentators and Congress to provide more specific information. \"At the end of August, however, reports emerged that a number of states had detected intrusions into election-related systems\u2014first two and then over a dozen. These revelations have generated significant public anxiety over the security of election systems and, when paired with dangerous campaign rhetoric regarding \u201crigged\u201d outcomes, have stoked genuine concern that people might not trust the integrity of election outcomes. Election-related systems certainly qualify as part of \u201ckey services\u201d to the public and the ability to call an election quickly and decisively is incredibly important to functional democratic transitions. \"This new information appears to be the impetus for the Administration\u2019s public statement this week. After all, for at least several months the White House has known, with high confidence, that the Russian Government was behind the DNC hack and leaks. The decision to not publicly respond was not based on a need for additional certainty, and there is no indication additional evidence has emerged. The apparent explanation for the change in position is intrusions into state election systems. That activity, either separately or combined with the prior intrusions, crossed the threshold for a response. \"With that in mind, the DHS and ODNI joint statement can be read in two distinct ways; it is both a message to Russia and a distinct reassurance to the American people. For Russia, the US government statement is a clear warning. The US government says it knows the Russian Government \u201cdirected\u201d the computer intrusions of US political organizations and is not afraid to say so on the record. This limits Russia\u2019s plausible deniability, and adds the U.S. case to the body of international evidence regarding Russian interference around the world, including intrusions into the German parliament and others. And the US government goes further, specifically indicating the leaks are consistent with Russian \u201cmethods and motivations\u201d which are to \u201cinterfere with the US election process.\u201d The US is typically hesitant to speculate regarding motivations, which can be difficult to discern and are often mixed. Doing so here offers a subtle warning: we know why you\u2019re doing it (Hint: we can hear you, even where you think we can\u2019t.) And naming \u201csenior-most officials\u201d as the responsible actors lays the groundwork to impose sanctions, pursuant to the recent Executive Order for sanctions against \u201cpersons engaging in significant malicious cyber-enabled activities.\u201d\n. . . \n\"Public attribution is itself a significant government response and elucidates some of the administration\u2019s sensibilities regarding line-drawing. . . .  \"Taking a broad view is sensible where Russia undertakes hybrid actions\u2014intrusion into computer systems (malicious cyber activity) combined with the strategic release of documents (information warfare)\u2014as well as larger efforts to undertake many distinct activities to achieve an overall goal\u2014to sow distrust in the US electoral system.

DNC stuff: NYT is a newpaper of record for the US. It's reporting is here, and it's tone and phrasing matters in this highly diplomatic situation: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/08/us/politics/us-formally-accuses-russia-of-stealing-dnc-emails.html?_r=0 The US doesn't have that great of relations with Russia at the moment, and interference with elections is a pretty major violation of national sovereignty, and there is nothing but election coverage in the US media at the moment, so if currents move toward pointing fingers during the post-Trump RNC soul-searching, there will be enough momentum to follow through with some pretty major policies, including possible sanctions. The end-of-the-year timeframe for the question is going to be pretty significant, because that will give only a little less than two months post-election for the national story to build up to official sanctions, although that story can and has been developing before the official election. (Sanctioning a nuclear power and member of the UN Security Council seems like it would be kind of a big deal, and might distract and/or have unpredictable political consequences if it happens before the election, and I don't think that the generally cautious Clinton would want that, and I don't think that Obama's interests are significantly different from Clinton's. Also, the NYT reported that the administration's current focus is on security the actual polling machines in the states from cyber attacks. Therefore I don't think that the US will sanction Russia before the election.) That being said, the official language that the US is using is \"influencing elections\", which is pretty explicit, and their statements included a clarification that US election systems are NOT \"critical infrastructure\", meaning that it does not fit into a category for which the US has vaguely threatened nuclear retaliation (http://defense-update.com/20130628_dempsey_threatens_responding_cyberattack_by_military_action.html - I thought that I remembered something more explicit, but I can't find any references.) So, from an international relations point of view, I think that sanctions are imminent. Furthermore, I think that the news cycle is going to go pretty quickly into a \"What the **** was that?\" after the election, and Russia is going to be a major part of that, if for no other reason than it will be a convenient scapegoat for the GOP to try to reclaim itself. Given the build-up that is happening now, and how the news cycle is likely to be timed, I'm placing the possibility of sanctions at pretty high. I'll go so far as to say 65%.  Revisiting the possibility from other threats: I don't think that China will do anything until they see how the Russia scenario plays out, but there is also the Christmas season to consider, and there are large economic interests there which might benefit from some government aid. However, if an attack happens around Christmas, it will take some time for the diplomatic build-up to result in sanctions, so we'll miss the deadline for the question. -> 0.5% The Iran stuff I had at 25% when it initially happened (what can I say, I'm a scardy cat), but due to the passage of time and competition for attention in the domain, I'll lower that to 2%. While the chance of needing to respond to Iran directly is decently low, the US needs to have a fairly strong stance on cybersecurity in general due to how aggressive Iran has been in the domain. Part of that strength has already been established, as it successfully withstood an Iranian DDOS attack (with unofficial attribution to Iran) and the official attribution of the Russian attack, as it not only demonstrates the ability of the US to attribute cyber attacks, but it also generically testifies to the US intelligence capabilities and its generic ability to monitor the Iran nuclear deal. However, especially because of the cyber-centric high-stakes relations with Iran, the US also needs to establish its resolve in pursuing cyber sovereignty. That means that Russia isn't going to be able to get away with weaker forms of saying \"I'm sorry\" to avoid escalation to sanctions.

And then?': http://www.wsj.com/articles/obamas-russia-epiphany-1475881969\nClips from WSJ article:\n\"The meddling in U.S. elections is another matter. In an unusual joint statement Friday, the Department of Homeland Security and Director of National Intelligence said that \u201cthe U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations.\u201d\nThe U.S. spooks added that \u201cthe Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia,\u201d and that given the \u201cscope and sensitivity\u201d of these efforts \u201conly Russia\u2019s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.\u201d Senior-most is a euphemism for Mr. Putin.\nOne question is why the Obama Administration has gone public with this hacking news now. One reason might be to warn Russia against dumping more of the U.S. documents it almost certainly has before Election Day. But then Russia\u2019s hacking habits are hardly new, and Mr. Putin is still harboring the national-security thief Edward Snowden. The timing suggests the White House may also be trying to help Hillary Clinton given her campaign\u2019s portrayal of Donald Trump as a Putin apologist. Sure enough, her campaign issued a statement linking Mr. Trump to the news almost on cue Friday.\nA public declaration alone won\u2019t stop the Russians.

Some analysts believe that a launch of long range ballistic missiles and large-scale cyber attacks may be carried out on October 10, the anniversary of the inauguration of the Workers' Party. In the past, the regime has launched crippling cyber attacks soon after nuclear tests conducted . . .  \"Soon after its second round of nuclear tests on May 25, 2009, North Korea was responsible for the infamous 7.7 DDOS attacks two months later against South Korea\u2019s Blue House (residence of the head of state), government agencies, financial institutions and several portal sites. Following the third round of nuclear tests in February 2013, North Korean hackers followed up with online assaults in March and June (on the anniversary of the start of the Korean War) of the same year, paralyzing infrastructure used by South Korean media and financial institutions, as well as the Blue House and government agencies. The hackers succeeded in stealing personal data in relation to key government and industry officials. \" Similarly, North Korea again launched a barrage of cyber warfare on South Korean infrastructure shortly after its fourth round of nuclear tests in January this year. Employees of the Korean Railway Research Institute were subjected to sophisticated phishing attacks, while more than 40,000 documents concerning military defense systems were stolen from conglomerates . . .  \"North Korean hacking units exhibit strengths in long term planning and characteristically wait for a specific time to launch attacks, even after successfully gaining access to their targeted systems. This became evident in their attacks against Hanjin and the SK Group, when it was later discovered that they had successfully hacked into the systems at least 20 months earlier. \"Moreover, even after seizing control of the administrative servers and networks of some institutions, attacks have not been forthcoming and the breach of security has been carefully concealed. It must be concluded that North Korean hacking units have been engaging in cyber warfare for a considerable length of time, leading to concerns for the magnitude of future assaults.  \"In an interview with Mr. Sang Myung Choi, director of HAURI CERT (Computer Emergency Response Team), it was revealed that \"the North Korean government is preparing cyber warfare on an international scale\" aimed at \"causing significant economic damage and safety issues, and to instigate social disorder\". \"He further added that North Korean hackers were \"concentrating their efforts on inflicting widespread damage upon military and defense industries\" and it is expected that \"an even greater magnitude of attack will be executed, dwarfing previous DDOS approaches and the targeting of financial institutions\". He further warned that upon \"close analysis of recent NK malware, it can only be concluded that NK hackers are aiming to cause significant damage to human life\". \"Director Choi is considered a leading expert in the field of computer security and is the head of Issue Makers Lab, a leading group in cyber malware research. He stressed that North Korean hacking units have targeted the South since early 2008 and that the \"danger of cyber attacks is rising to a new scale in terms of the damage that will occur\". \"He added that ever since Kim Jong Un came to power, these sophisticated attacks have increased dramatically in terms of their frequency, audacity, and scale. Furthermore, Director Choi feels that \"Kim Jong Un has strengthened what Kim Jong Il started\". While the extent of the Kim Jong Il's regime\u2019s cyber attacks can be summed up as two major attacks (the 2009 DDOS attack and the freezing of Nong Hyup\u2019s banking systems in March 2011), \"there have been numerous major attacks carried out continuously under the Kim Jong Un regime\".  \"Furthermore,. . .  under Kim Jong Un's regime, \"these threats have escalated and a number of serious attacks were inflicted upon important institutions such as the Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Corporation (KHNP) aimed at causing social disorder and unrest, and even upon international markets in order to profit from currency exchanges\". \"He further added that changes within the North Korean hacking units   . . in recent times they have shown an alarming level of cohesion in the concentration and coordination of their efforts.  Kim Jong-un considers cyber warfare as an \"all-powerful sword\" that shall be used to cause \"as much damage and disorder as possible without culpability\" and also to \"garner valuable information concerning nuclear and missile technology\". As such, he is expected to continue to concentrate and further develop the North\u2019s cyber attack capabilities as a form of asymmetrical warfare.  \"As the North\u2019s cyber attacks become more widespread, Director Choi feels that ransomware is emerging as one of the most dangerous form of attacks.  . . . Chief Choi revealed that \"there is a very high probability that North Korean hackers will use ransomware in their next attacks and have the sufficient skills and preparation to execute such threats\". \"The ransom payments are often demanded in the digital currency known as Bitcoin. Recent cyber attacks on the internet portal site Interpark show that North Korea understands the significance of Bitcoin, while online infrastructure supporting the use of Bitcoin is already widespread throughout North Korean internet sites such as the Chosun-Expo portal site. It is a real concern that North Korea is planning to use ransomware and Bitcoin as a major new source of foreign currency.\n. . . \n\"When asked to comment on the issue of whether civilians could become the targets of North Korean ransomware, director Choi mentioned that \"as evident in the attacks against the SK Group and Korea Airlines, even large multi-national corporations are susceptible to these attacks and there are limits as to how much corporations can protect themselves.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  \nIf North Korea does launch a cyber attack in time. . . 60%?\nIf that attack is directed towards an entity in North America or the EU . . . .  20%?\nIf that attack is recognized and attributed in time . . . .10%?\nIf GJO doesn't disqualify it because it thinks that the attack was actually launched prior to 1/1/16  . . . 50%?\nIf a state imposes sanctions in time . . . 5%  Then. . . . .

An easy way for you to obtain the same realization might be to simply read the headline of the story and then just skip immediately to the final, concluding, paragraph. Then, ask yourself, if whether, upon accepting the implied conclusion of this last paragraph, you feel comfortable with extending such a rationale (\"Whatever. Stuff happens. Nothing to get excited about or to do about it.\") to the headline instance (\"Threat of U.S. elections being stolen via hacking.\").\nhttp://abcnews.go.com/US/fbi-warns-cyberattacks-state-election-boards/story?id=41719997 The author begins with a serious threat to U.S. democracy and leaves the reader with a proffered belief structure vis-a-vis that threat of: Don't bother caring. (As in the classic reflexive control model of moving from Point A to Point X without opposition, the reader is being induced not to care, not to raise a defensive counter-measure.) 1) The author conflates instance types. Hacking email is NOT the same as (potentially) hacking election vote counts. The more rational response to the news is that, like everything else in life, a proper risk-analysis is first required. You feel comfortable in most circumstances in taking some amount of cash from an ATM cash machine. Would you, in the exact same circumstances, feel comfortable in taking your entire life savings out in cash from the ATM? Probably not, and you would change your behavior based on your understanding of the risk of the threat (in this case, the difference in the amount of potential loss). So the author, by first conflating stolen elections with hacked emails, and then hacked emails with cyber attacks in general, takes the reader down a garden path to a highly-risky behavioral recommendation. [NB - The transference in an informational deceptive scheme need not be physical property. It need not even be an asset, it just might be in the form of the foisting of a liability upon you. Or, as in this case, it can even be in the form of foisting increased risk upon you.] 2) If you're rational, you allocate care, diligence, vigilance, etc. to things of high perceived value, things that matter. All cyberattacks are not the same, and the solution to some cyberattacks is not to simply \"just not care.\" The optimal solution to preventing election theft via cyberattack is to use public hand-counting of paper ballots. It is not as fast as electronic balloting, but it is far more secure. Some, who believe that the most fundamental right in a democracy is the franchise of voting, might prefer such an approach to \"not caring.\""], [691, "2016-08-29T19:29:54Z", [0.05], ""], [28648, "2016-08-29T07:49:43Z", [0.1], ""], [6303, "2016-08-29T00:17:53Z", [0.05], "According to the general news and GJP consensus."], [368, "2016-08-28T18:27:22Z", [0.0], ""], [2965, "2016-08-28T15:35:03Z", [0.04], ""], [691, "2016-08-28T15:22:08Z", [0.05], ""], [601, "2016-08-28T00:42:13Z", [0.15], ""], [691, "2016-08-27T20:06:30Z", [0.05], ""], [15196, "2016-08-27T15:11:51Z", [0.15], ""], [15548, "2016-08-27T13:12:00Z", [0.06], ""], [13377, "2016-08-26T22:19:29Z", [0.1], ""], [14777, "2016-08-26T21:53:22Z", [0.35], ""], [368, "2016-08-26T17:43:10Z", [0.0], ""], [53, "2016-08-26T04:00:26Z", [0.1], "Not changing forecast - just noting that there are some very sneaky attacks going on at present & wanted to share.\nNYTimes article worth reading: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/26/technology/apple-software-vulnerability-ios-patch.html  but gives impression that this is primarily problem for activists.

Hayden, ignoring this point (and this is the only point that really matters), twists Trumps' request into an \"invitation\" to conduct a cyber attack, ignoring that the request presumes the attack was already done. This, from the man that knows the U.S., lacking any invitation, routinely steals every email they can get their hands on from Russian and other foreign politicians, and who personally oversaw the construction of the elaborate system which allows the NSA to do the same to every U.S. citizen. The difference between the two is that the NSA needs to try just a little to capture the Russian emails, whereas with the domestic emails they don't need to try at all because the comprehensive automated system to do so is already in place. Trump is not inviting or encouraging Russian espionage. He is, however, definitely encouraging the sharing of such intelligence with the American public. This is certainly provocative, and is apparently \"deeply troubling\" to some intelligence professionals. What's really troubling, however, is that American voters might need to rely upon Russian espionage to get information as to the disconnect between the formal and informal Clinton pronouncements. It's a balancing of priorities. Whose interests are more important: Clinton's or those of the public? That this is even a question to these intelligence professionals is what's troubling. If the press asserts that the 33,000 emails are no more than dentist appointments and birthday greetings, fine, case closed. The intelligence professionals need not be concerned, Clinton has already asserted that these 33,000 emails which she deleted were non-sensitive, personal emails. What's the worry? If the movement is to reduce the knowledge gap between formal and informal organizational/communication structures, it seems like we can't allow legal niceties such as claims to privacy or evidentiary exclusion rules to impede public understanding as applied to extraordinarily powerful organizational roles. Some innovative organizational restructuring seems required so as to increase the transparency of certain roles. (The situation is doubly-complicated in that Clinton went \"off the reservation\" with the private server in the first place, thus breaking the assumption that all emails would be retained within the system outside of the control of the very party potentially most interested in removing any that were derogatory. In this respect, Clinton herself has created the situation that calls for the waiving of otherwise reasonable privacy claims.) If the \"press as filter\" model, as initiated by Snowden, is all we currently have, it is better to use that than to avoid reducing the gap. I'm coming to think that the knowledge gap is a form of latent chaos. The greater the gap, the more chaos unleashed upon the organization should the gap be revealed. No matter the chaos, however, revelation of the gap seems always preferable, because the gap also represents a constant source of unaccountable harm to the organization. It is possible that if Russia were held to be accountable for the revelation of these emails that the recently announced (created?) \"public confidence\" sanction condition might apply. It would be so crazy ironic, however, where public confidence in their understanding of reality increased (albeit at the expense of public confidence in Hilary Clinton), and became a sanctionable event. I don't believe justification for such a sanction could be politically sustained; or rather, that the fight to do so would be worth it. --------------\n\"calling for a foreign power to interfere in our election by unlawfully releasing classified information.\"\nhttp://foreignpolicy.com/2016/07/27/how-should-the-united-states-respond-to-russias-election-meddling/ This is a crafty but disingenuous argument. Since when is a foreign government subject to U.S. laws relating to release of classified information? It's the Snowden dilemma. What do you do when confronted with a moral decision? The revelation of hypocrisy or the adherence to the rule of law? At what point does it become a no-brainer? Suppose a leaked email revealed, without a doubt, that Clinton was a paid agent of China? Suppose the emails revealed Clinton as a liar, as untrustworthy? Is not that knowledge more important than simple adherence to the law? \"Do those who seek to put America First really want or trust the Russians to help them do that?\"\nhttp://foreignpolicy.com/2016/07/27/how-should-the-united-states-respond-to-russias-election-meddling/ This is a great question, and I very much hope that people are fully prepared for the majority answer. If we acknowledge that trust is problematic, and set that aside, is this a science question, where right and wrong correspond to reality? Or is it a legal question, where right and wrong definitely do not consistently correspond with a moral judgment, but may correspond to the efficient administration of general justice? I suspect the majority of people would desire the scientific answer. So, in reply to the author, it is indeed a question of right and wrong; scientific right and wrong. When it comes to *knowledge* that allows for the prevention of harm, science is the standard, not law.

To anybody acquainted with how Russia\u2019s powerful intelligence services actually operate, the idea that Snowden is their collaborator is no more controversial than stating that the sun rises in the east every morning.\nThe proper espionage term for Edward Snowden is defector, meaning an employee of an intelligence service who takes up residence in another country whose spies are not friends. Since 1917, every single Western intelligence defector to Moscow has cooperated with the Kremlin, on grounds of quid pro quo. There is no known case of a defector not collaborating with the KGB or its successors. If you want sanctuary, you will tell the Russians everything you know. That is how the spy game works.\nAny Russian intelligence officer who wants sanctuary in the United States will be required to collaborate with American spy services, including extended debriefings by multiple intelligence agencies. Are we really supposed to believe that Vladimir Putin, former KGB colonel, is more charitable?\n\u201cOf course\u201d Snowden is collaborating with Russian intelligence, explained Oleg Kalugin more than two years ago. A legend in global spy circles, Major General Kalugin is the former head of foreign counterintelligence for the KGB\u2019s elite First Chief Directorate. In the Cold War, Kalugin recruited moles inside American intelligence just like Edward Snowden. He is an expert witness here. Kalugin made clear that Snowden\u2019s new life revolves around the Federal Security Service, Putin\u2019s powerful FSB. \u201cThe FSB are now his hosts, and they are taking care of him,\u201d he explained: \u201cWhatever he had access to in his former days at NSA, I believe he shared all of it with the Russians, and they are very grateful.\u201d\nTo anybody familiar with how Russia works, there can be no doubt that Snowden has been an agent of the Kremlin at least beginning with his arrival in Moscow three years ago. Whether he was recruited by the Russian intelligence before that is likely \u2013 as I\u2019ve explained before, it would be highly abnormal for the FSB to grant sanctuary to an American defector they have never met \u2013 yet it remains an open question, and a very important one. Whether Snowden has collaborated with the Kremlin since June 2013, however, is not an open question.\nSince joining Twitter last year, Snowden has pontificated from Moscow on a wide range of issues. In rare form, he entered the debate regarding the NSA special committee, sending out this remarkable tweet yesterday. (It says: \u201cWhether Maassen is an agent of the SVR or FSB\u201d \u2013 that is, Russian intelligence \u2013 \u201ccannot currently be verified.\u201d) Challenging the BfV director head-on with a mocking tweet is a strange turn of events in the Snowden saga. Moreover, when did Snowden learn such good German?

Seems to me that it may take awhile to sort out what types of responses fit which cyber-related situations.  Regarding the Bowman Dam incident specifically, since there was no damage and it was a small facility, perhaps sanctions would be seen as an escalation - particularly right now when Iran is so anxious to have sanctions removed. There are other incidents that could trigger sanctions which would resolve this question in positive - NK & Sony stuff for one, & Sweden suspects that Russia was behind an air traffic controller outage last November ( http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/04/12/sweden_suspects_russian_hackers_hit_air_traffic_control/ ), and there are others.  But - question of what is an appropriate response to what type of cyber attack is probably something to resolve first, before any sanctions applied.   So - maybe a more appropriate leading indicator for this question than occurrence of cyber attack or attribution to state entity is existence & circulation of official discussion on proportional response to cyber warfare.

Hence, monetary rewards, penalties, time cost and opportunity costs are imposed on all and they  rise as  superforecasters approach the \"Green Room\"\nI am not a superforecaster.

In addition to its fourth underground nuclear test and another attempted satellite launch atop a Taepodong/Unha rocket, which can also serve as an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the North has recently published sets of photos of what it claims are a miniaturized nuclear warhead and a ground test of a rocket nose cone to demonstrate its re-entry capability.

That is, even if you know that an attack originated from device A in building B in agency C, you can rarely tie that to individual X without \"being there\" at that device at that time. Maybe, just maybe, you get such inside information on one-in-ten, one-in-twenty, attacks.

The indictment, while long expected, is the first time that the Obama administration has sought action against Iranians for a wave of computer attacks on the United States that began in 2011. \"The indictment does not say that the attacks were directed by the Revolutionary Guards. But it referred to those who were charged as \u201cexperienced computer hackers\u201d who \u201cperformed work on behalf of the Iranian Government, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\u201d \" . . .intelligence experts have long speculated that the attacks aimed at some of America\u2019s largest banks \u2014 including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Capital One and PNC Bank \u2014 were retaliation [for Stuxnet].  The indictment also cited attacks on the New York Stock Exchange and AT&T.\n. . .\n\"None of the named Iranians live in the United States and it is doubtful that they will ever make it to an American courtroom. In that respect the indictment is similar to one the Justice Department issued two years ago against members of Unit 61398 of the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army, which it accused of stealing data from American corporations. But the administration argues that such indictments send a strong signal, and make it difficult for those who were indicted to travel, for fear they could be extradited. \" . . .  The indictment appeared part of an American effort to keep Iran from taking the energy previously reserved for its nuclear program to bolster its growing corps of cyberwarriors, some of whom work directly for the government while others, like those named in the indictment, appear to be contractors. \"As a measure of the importance the administration placed on the indictment, it was announced by Attorney General Loretta Lynch, in a news conference in Washington with the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara, where the indictment was handed down. It was unclear how long it had been under seal.\n. . . \nAt the news conference, James B.

This national emergency is the result of actions taken by North Korea. The specific acts which constitute the scope of this national emergency are enumerated in this Order, and by explicit reference, all relevant previous Executive Orders (which are cited). Among these, is the January 2, 2015 Order which included the \"cyber-related actions during November and December 2014\" (the Sony hack attack) as a finding and constituent element in the national emergency. By reference then, the Sony hack attack is contained within the scope of the current national emergency. This satisfies the \"in response to\" criteria. Any one of the enumerated actions ordered by Obama constitutes the \"imposition\" criteria. It is not a trivial distinction to separate imposition from enforcement, so I take it that since they have been ordered they are thereby imposed; and whether they are enforced is irrelevant. For those that might insist upon an element to element correlation, rather than a set to set correlation, I can only ask for you to explain what \"in response to\" element the imposition of searching Korean vessels or freezing transactions of members of the Workers Party specifically relates to. Whatever model of a sanction you embrace, it must be able to address these impositions. I'm thinking you will find that any model that ties impositions to responses does so only through the entity of national emergency. It may not be satisfactory, but these are what sanctions are; and whatever other model you might maintain needs to address all impositions. I take \"imposition\" to be the operative verb (requiring obtainment after question initiation), and the \"in response to\" event a prerequisite. If it is the condition that the prerequisite event must also occur after the question initiation, then that would cause the question to become invalid, since ALL malicious cyber related activities were encapsulated prior to the question and there would never be a need to enumerate a particular attack since then. (The only reason the Sony hack attack was specifically enumerated was that it was included within the national emergency prior to the expansion of the scope of the national emergency to include all North Korean malicious cyber related activities). I'm hoping that you will see that the freezing of all transactions of the North Korean Worker's party (and other such \"free floating\" impositions) clarifies that impositions are in response to a set of prior actions, including the Sony attack, and that the imposition bit need not, in any way, relate to the realm or domain in which the \"in response to\" behavior initially took place. And, for those who might continue to believe that \"proof\" is required, you'll note that no proof is offered for the Sony hack finding. Here's an article by an author who is also struggling with the intuitive notion that sanctions require proof, or that perhaps cyber sanctions are a special sort that require proof. I think he would have been better off with the flat-out conclusion that a problem with sanctions is that they are, in a very real sense, unilateral declarations of war; rather than beating around the bush as to how problematic they are to substantiate.\nhttp://www.csmonitor.com/World/Passcode/Passcode-Voices/2016/0316/Opinion-Before-pointing-fingers-after-cyberattacks-Remember-the-Maine"], [11686, "2016-03-17T16:16:47Z", [0.35], ""], [2965, "2016-03-17T14:26:58Z", [1.0], ""], [2965, "2016-03-17T14:07:25Z", [0.9], "disregard the 60. maybe it was my computer, but I made an erroneous entry.\nHere is the correct entry.\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/03/16/executive-order-blocking-property-government-north-korea-and-workershttps://www.gjopen.com/questions/97-before-the-end-of-2016-will-a-north-american-country-the-eu-or-an-eu-member-state-impose-sanctions-on-another-country-in-response-to-a-cyber-attack-or-cyber-espionage#comments_exclude_forecast_info\nLike @asseawaf15 I am at 90.

US surveillance/espionage is unlikely to produce that result, because the states in question have many other ties that will be strained before it gets to the point of sanctions. (And really, who has ever even spoken about imposing sanctions on the United States?).  Cyber powers outside of the generically western block include Russia, Israel, North Korea, and China. Russian activity is largely criminal rather than state sponsored, and is therefore unlikely to result in sanctions, but I'll add a single percentage point because the Russian State probably has access to the means of a cyber offensive. (1%) Israel is unlikely to target western countries and has the non-sanction consequence of a deteriorating relationship with the US if it does.  There was some movement on issuing further sanctions on North Korea, including a bill introduced in the Senate ordering the president to issue sanctions. However, that bill is likely unconstitutional, and it doesn't seem to be doing much but languishing in committee. (comment thread where this issue was exposed in the GJOpen community - https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/124508, Status of the bill - https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/2144). That being said, there is a history of sanctions being imposed on North Korea in response to a cyber attack, and something similar might happen again. -> 3% China was mentioned in the prompt description for good reason - it has large state sponsored cyber offensive infrastructure, and relations with how it is using it are heating up as China illegally accesses sensitive data and and manipulates critical infrastructure. China uses a fair amount of its cyber abilities to conduct economic espionage - something that was condemned by both sides in the 2015 talks, and an action for which the US threatened sanctions. I find it unlikely that China will completely stop its economic cyber espionage, but it a result of the talks is likely that it will take more efforts in being subtle about it. Furthermore, it would take a serious breach in order for the US to change China's status as a trading partner to anything other than the current \"Permanent Normal Trade Relations\". So: we have on the table a subtle threat from the US to China regarding an activity that China is almost certainly going to continue engaging in. Will that activity escalate to the point that the US must carry out that subtle threat in the next year? Probably not, but it's a non-zero chance. Let's put it at about 10%.

It is a complex act with two phases structured in the format that I have previously described: The first, a \"finding,\" or in the case of the U.N., a \"noting,\" which is the set of sanctionee acts the imposition of coercive acts by the sanctionor is in response to. The second, the imposition itself, and in the U.N. language, that which countries are \"called upon\" to do.\nhttp://www.un.org/press/en/2006/sc8792.doc.htm I contend that if the U.N. \"notes\" that North Korea has engaged in cyber-attacks or cyber-espionage, and \"calls upon\" member states to impose some action on some North Korean entity, and the member state does so, then that member state will have imposed sanctions on North Korea in response to a cyber-attack or cyber-espionage (done so under the auspices of the U.N.). Quick note on the country versus individual bit. I'm not sure where this stands today, but there was at one time the very explicit understanding that any private entity engaging in international commerce never had any standing other than being an agent of his/her country. So, for example, when country A goes to war with country B, the idea that company X (domiciled in country B) can say, \"Hey, we're independent of country B,\" is considered ridiculous. Company X is confiscated until the end of the war, and maybe it gets returned after. We may have an intuitive notion that individual entities are different that the states, perhaps stronger now than ever, but from an historical perspective it doesn't seem to be that way.

Interested in other views!"], [498, "2016-02-25T04:50:55Z", [0.99], "This is actually a very good question, from the standpoint of being intellectually challenging. There are a variety of things going on with this question. I'm just going to focus on one particular aspect now, but as I said, there are many cool things going on overall. Some named concepts, like \"Initial Public Offering\" are names of both processes (\"Google's IPO\") and events (the actual initial listing of Google shares available for sale on a public exchange). These two things, while obviously related, are not strictly the same thing. For example, \"Google's IPO\" might include such things as underwriting, the quiet period, etc.; all things involved in the process of getting to that one event of the actual initial listing of shares. In the case of the IPO, the final phase of the process, that actual listing event, is just one of many phases in the IPO process. A \"sanction\" is similar in that it is a name for a process or activity. The sanction process, unlike an IPO, has just two basic phases: the response phase and the imposition phase. It's a little confusing because \"response\" is typically something that occurs after something else, but strictly in terms of understanding a sanction, the response phase comes first in a sequential order with the imposition phase invariably subsequent. Another difficulty is that, like an IPO, we often confuse the name of the activity for the name of a phase. Here, we often call the imposition phase the sanction. But we are confusing the generally unnamed phase (the imposition phase) with the name of the activity. Another way to look at a sanction is to consider it as a complex act, comprised of two subsidiary acts, that are related in sequence, purpose, etc., but are independent. The two acts are \"response\" and \"imposition.\" It may sound unreasonable to you, but it is my personal experience that people have an extremely difficult time is managing their understandings as to complex acts. We're very good at discerning each individual act, but since the connection between the two acts is generally \"in the mind\" of another person, we are usually very crappy in managing our understanding of complex acts performed by others. Of all complex acts, a \"sanction\" is one of the easier ones to understand because there are only two constituent acts, and these acts are always sequentially related in the same sequence. Another way to think of a complex act is as a single act (which it is) with two phases. With a sanction-act, there are two discrete phases, always related in the same sequential fashion: response and imposition. So while complex acts in general are typically hard for people to manage, as far as complex acts go, \"sanction\" is one of the easiest: just two phases, always in the same sequential order. \"Fraud\" is an example of a complex act that is far more challenging to conceptually manage. While fraud consists of three phases (deception, theft, and conversion), the phases need not be discrete, and they need not occur in the same (i.e., normal) sequence, and the conversion phase need not occur at all. All this to try to assist you in getting your head around the notion that a \"sanction\" consists of two discrete independent phases (response and imposition). I've wasted enough of your time already on a theoretical approach to understanding sanctions. Here's some real live stuff: A couple of weeks ago @Mos was kind enough to provide a video link that pertained to North Korean sanctions: https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/hearing/subcommittee-hearing-us-response-north-korea-s-nuclear-provocations . It's a long video, but it did help me a lot in gaining my perspective on exactly what sanctions are. That is, what is really meant when someone on Capital Hill speaks of a sanction. (You'll also see why China is so crucial to a successful North Korean sanction program.) Also, here's a link to the original Sony hack sanction: http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-30670884 . Here you will see that those upon whom the coercive measures were imposed (imposition) were not the actors that did the deed (in response to). Whatever understanding of \"sanction\" you come up with, I suggest, has got to meet all the nuances of these two real world examples. You have to \"operationalize\" a definition, so to speak, so that it can contain every instance of a (current political) \"sanction\" that you can possibly throw at it. If there's a difficulty with an instance, don't discard the instance and say it wasn't a sanction or whatever, operationalize your definition to accommodate it."], [102, "2016-02-25T02:16:27Z", [0.85], ""], [3225, "2016-02-25T02:07:08Z", [0.8], "Now China and the US are seeking to implement joint sanctions on NK for their activities, including cyber.

Denying funds was the sanction for me, and this act the vehicle.  I accept I am wrong.   Now I am trying to figure out how would under this act NK as a country can be sanctioned given denying the funds is not a sanction. A designated person seems to be the only thing here now ito cyber. A designated person is someone who breaks what I thought were the sanctions or engages in further activities that brought about sanctions (as I saw them).  But a designated person is not NK, that is someone who assists NK.  That wont count. So I dont see anyway how the country can be sanctioned under this act.  If they do another sony attack, this act will be used to impose what against NK?  It can only target people and corps to deny fund to NK.  It is already restricted in trade etc which is not deemed a sanction and cannot be *more* restricted than it is, and we are saying that doesnt count anyway. I am then basing my view that pretty much any law from EU or other countries will be similarly worded with similar outcome.

For an understanding of sanctions, it is really important that you understand how this can be the case. Sanctions are penalties on behaviors (xyz) that are not necessarily associated with those behaviors that inspired the sanctions (abc). That is, the \"imposition\" and the \"in response to\" are independent sets. This is what sanctions are. The behaviors that inspired the sanctions (for which the sanctions are in response) have already been done and have been identified as such (along with a number of other behaviors). The requirement that sanctions be \"actually imposed for a cyber attack or cyber espionage,\" therefore, may be the GJ standard, but it is misleading as to how sanctions are in fact employed in international law. The \"actual\" cyber-attack has already occurred. All that is required now is for the imposition of a sanction. And, as I said previously, any sanction under the Law would do. (Whatever \"instinct\" for fairness or tying the two (independent) sets together you may have, you need to recognize that this is not how sanctions are in fact used. General Kung Park is going to have his assets frozen, and he may have no connection whatsoever to any of the (bad) behaviors enumerated under the North Korea Sanctions Act as those creating a \"crisis\" to which the Act responds. Yet, he will be sanctioned under that act. The \"actual\" (bad) behavior is independent of the behavior upon which the penalty is assessed. That is the nature of sanctions. [\"the targets of the sanctions were not (may not be) directly involved\"] Edit: It's really good to have this understanding of how sanctions are actually employed, so that whenever you hear the word \"sanction\" you do indeed need to consider the very real possibility that penalties will befall individuals and entities that are wholly \"innocent\" as to the originating underlying bad acts. You can think of sanctions as you wish, perhaps as a form of coercion against future behavior rather than a penalty for past behaviors. But whatever you think, you should recognize that the act(s) to which they are in response are only coincidentally, if at all, correlated with the behaviors that are punished. They are very handy tools then, for those who are inclined to use them, to apply political and economic pressure in all sorts of ways. Edit2: The teacher returns to the class and says: \"Students, upon my return from the hallway where I was speaking with Principal Jones, I find (nb-\"finding\") the class pet out of her cage, the sink running unattended, and many of you out of your seats. As a result, I am going to impose an after school detention upon the entire class.\" The set of bad behaviors are independent of the punishment. Is Mary Jane innocent? Maybe. Did Mary Jane get sanctioned for the fact that the class pet got loose? Yes. That is what sanctions are. Sometimes they are \"targeted\" in ways where guilt correlates more closely with punishment. Sometimes they are not. Sometimes they are just \"targeted\" be be more effective at placing coercive pressure on certain actors. Was the teacher \"fair?\" Probably not. So we also see that sanctions involve the use of an enforcement power that is (or may be) divorced from moral legitimacy. Edit3: The above is actually a crappy example, because it's fashioned more as a punishment than as coercion against future behavior. How about \"until I can leave and return to the classroom and find you sitting in your seats and doing your assignments, we will do without the morning recess,\" or something like that.

An announcement will be made once a decision is reached.  Just to add a comment: it might be very hard to resolve the question with the mandatory vs. discretionary issue.  It isn't constitutional for Congress to mandate that the president use his executive authority, and in a way, the wording of the bill recognizes this fact with doubletalk. The bill \"mandates\" that the president \"shall\" designate individuals to sanction (for cyber), but only those \"that [he] the President determines\" have violated a certain criteria. So, the president both has and doesn't have discretion here? The president also has the authority in the bill to determine how he wants to sanction someone.  Congress can't force the president to do anything (and it looks like the wording in the bill is talking out of both sides of it's mouth). It's like if Congress passed a bill mandating that the president \"will appoint\" the best qualified next Supreme Court Justice based upon A. B. and C. criteria (but only if he determines/interprets that he meets A. B. and C. criteria.) \"(a) Mandatory designations.\u2014Except as provided in section 208, the President shall designate under this subsection any person that the President determines\u2014 \" So the bill says that cyber sanction are in the future mandatory, while also saying that he is able to determine himself if a cyber violation occurs.   In the end a sanction is not a sanction unless it is actually in effect. I admit that this question should close as a yes if the President designates an offender for cyber, but until it happens I can't see the question closing as yes.  Obama has 90 days to either do this or not, and I'm very curious to see if he will. Obama signed the bill and remained silent afterwards. And the larger purpose of the bill is to try to force Obama to take action against NK and sanction them because (as of right now) he is in heated discussions with China and doesn't want to.

Sanctions, in the sense that they are used by the EU and the United States, are punishment of future behaviors for past behaviors. When applied to something like a country, there is no requirement that the sanctioned entity participated in the past behavior, only that it might facilitate the future behavior; which is itself not necessarily correlated to the past behavior. I know some of you have objected to this interpretation because it may not seem intuitively fair. I am only trying to inform you of how they are, in practice, used; and thus, how we should think of them in terms of this question. Here's hopefully a clarifying example. The past bad behavior was the Russian annexation of Crimea. The sanctions were levied against \"a group of about a dozen Russian business leaders or influential figures.\" The past behavior is not, unless coincidentally, correlated to the sanctioned behavior.\nhttp://www.dw.com/en/sanctioned-russians-get-itchy-feet/a-18708446 To keep insisting that a specific \"cyber sanction\" is required misses the point of how sanctions are employed.

All the findings, taken together, comprise what the sanctions are \"in response to.\" So any sanction, whether directed to a target that facilitates money-laundering, or that enables the importation of luxury goods, or that does bad cyber stuff (coincidentally), or whatever, would be a sanction imposed \"in response to\" a cyber-attack (among the other enumerated things). [Edit: It's easy to get ones head around \"the annexation of Crimea\" as a name for a whole bunch of sub-activities. The recent Law has an equivalent name for the set of sub-activities being responded to. It is termed \"the crisis.\" Maybe they could have called in something more descriptive.

The bill is in response to a crisis which includes two cyber attacks; so the \"in response to\" bit seems satisfied. 2) We're left with the \"impose sanctions on\" bit. It doesn't seem that any specific sanction would need to be tied to a specific cyber act or cyber actor, because the way the bill is written it says that: \"We're going to respond to this entire list of bad things you've done (the \"crisis\" you've caused), and sanction you in a whole bunch of ways.\" That is, the set of sanctions is in response to the set of bad things done, so any sanction imposed is in response to the entire set of bad things. A sanction is imposed ON an activity and AGAINST a (set of) behavior(s). With this bill, there is no specific sanction to specific bad thing correlation; just a set of sanctions to a set of bad things correlation. Therefore, any sanction should do. This is clearly exemplified by the sanction on luxury goods. The sanctions are imposed on (any) X against all Y (the list of bad behaviors). The targeting of sanctions within the bill is the methodology for developing the set X only, it does not establish a requirement that set X and behaviors Y items are correlated; although in most instances they are related. Any sanction imposed under this bill, whether it be on luxury goods, financial transactions, etc., will be a response to the entire list of bad things (which includes two specific cyber attacks).  3) There is the detail of actual imposition, which requires that \"the President shall designate under this subsection any person that the President determines\" and other actions to actually effectuate the sanctions. Theoretically, I guess, the President might never make such a determination (for any sanction whatsoever).

I have read the bill, and reading legislation is no more fun than it used to be when I did it for a living.  The bill requires the president to sanction \"persons\" that the president finds have done some stuff, which would under the other definitions include the offenses in this Q.   \"Persons\" are individuals or entities as defined by the secretaries of state and treasury;  this could but does not necessarily include national governments.

Notably, the legislation includes mandatory punishments for North Korean cyber-criminals, as well as sanctions for business dealings that involve precious metals that could help Pyongyang and its effort to develop weapons of mass destruction. \u201cThis is groundbreaking in terms of its sanctioning of cyber attacks,\u201d said Gardner, R-Colo., in a phone interview. \u201cAnd that\u2019s important \u2014 critically important \u2014 because North Korea is improving its asymmetric cyber capabilities.\u201d He said he hoped to see a Senate floor vote by mid-February.

In addition to an increase in data breaches, privacy attorneys expect that large-scale breaches, along with companies' handling of personal information, will cause a large wave of cybersecurity litigation moving forward, even as the heightened publicity of some attacks hasn't yet translated into a larger number of suits or more successful results for plaintiffs in class actions.\n[...]\nSo, why do privacy attorneys expect that large-scale breaches will fuel a larger wave of cybersecurity litigation moving forward?

There are different types of cyber-ofenses:\nCyber-attack is any type of offensive maneuver employed by individuals or whole organizations that targets computer information systems, infrastructures, computer networks, and/or personal computer devices by various means of malicious acts usually originating from an anonymous source that either steals, alters, or destroys a specified target by hacking into a susceptible system. This type of attack can be perpetrate by a group of teens with too much free time; by professional hackers working on their own or for a country; or by legitimate countries.\nCyber spying, or cyber espionage, is the act or practice of obtaining secrets without the permission of the holder of the information (personal, sensitive, proprietary or of classified nature), from individuals, competitors, rivals, groups, governments and enemies for personal, economic, political or military advantage. CE, well almost every country does it, In fact in September 2015, the United States and China agreed not to allow parties in their nations to cyberspy on each other for commercial gain, but did not prohibit government spying.\nCyber-terrorism is \u201cthe use of computer network tools to shut down critical national infrastructures (such as energy, transportation, government operations) or to coerce or intimidate a government or civilian population. CT is the most dangerous one.\nWe could split hairs even more than that, but it should suffice for now. PLAYERS: The two predominant players are China\u2019s cyber capabilities compared to United States\u2019 capabilities. There are many other state and non-state actors involved in cyberwarfare, such as Russia, Iran, Iraq, and Al Qaeda; but China and the U.S. are leading the foreground in cyberwarfare capabilities.\nSANCTIONS: In response to recent cyber-attacks on April 1, 2015 President Obama issued an Executive Order establishing the first-ever economic sanctions. The Executive Order will impact individuals and entities (\u201cdesignees\u201d) responsible for cyber-attacks that threaten the national security, foreign policy, economic health, or financial stability of the US. Specifically, the Executive Order authorizes the Treasury Department to freeze designees\u2019 assets.\nEU:  The EU is not doing much, or perhaps they are planning some actions as the EU looks particularly vulnerable to Cyberterrorism lately.

One possibility might be that it would be a ban of an entire set or class of individual or corporate types originating from within a particular country based on product or service. For example, as with the Russian reverse-sanction-sanction of banning importation of food categories from selected countries. Would a ban in the United States on the importation of any rug made in Iran be a sanction on Iran or the carpet-makers? Provided the ban is universal (\"all carpets from X\") I think we could say it was a sanction against X, not just the carpet-makers. So, what universal-type bans would be an appropriate response for a cyber-attack? There's also a difference between export and import bans. They may have comparable symbolism, but export bans are more difficult to enforce. Further, there is also consideration of the specific nature of the economic trade existing between the two relevant nations. Sanctions on the importation of product A from country X might be quite strong, if the export of product A by country X is meaningful. So, in particular circumstances, tying matchsticks or coconuts to cyber-attacks might not be far-fetched at all. Bans on imports also usually incur some cost to the importer. So sanctions, via bans, are a rich area with a lot of flexibility ranging over symbolism to economic effects. If cyber warfare continues as it has, no doubt such cyber-sanctions are to follow. Perhaps there is a joint NSA, Treasury, State department working group within the U.S. actively developing a framework for these now. At this point, however, I haven't caught wind of any such framework. There is also the complication that cyber-warfare is handled within the military command structure, so an integrated economic response might be out of the realm of their expertise, and not even a part of their solution domain. \"The U.S. needs to get cyber sanctions right.\"\nhttp://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-right-way-sanction-cyber-threats-13975"], [10849, "2015-12-23T13:54:08Z", [0.05], ""], [102, "2015-12-23T11:22:43Z", [0.25], ""], [12118, "2015-12-23T09:37:30Z", [0.15], ""], [11080, "2015-12-23T04:57:39Z", [0.15], ""], [13377, "2015-12-23T04:51:47Z", [0.28], "Following https://larswericson.wordpress.com/2015/12/22/double-median-filter/"], [2515, "2015-12-23T03:22:27Z", [0.02], ""], [821, "2015-12-23T01:53:30Z", [0.1], "News Update: EU member states have recently agreed upon cyber security law.   \"Under the measure, internet companies such as Google, Amazon, eBay and Cisco - but not social networks like Facebook - will be required to report serious incidents to national authorities, which in turn will be able to impose sanctions on companies that fail to do so.\" http://www.euractiv.com/sections/digital/eu-lawmakers-countries-agree-cybersecurity-law-320212 This falls a tad short of imposing sanctions on another country.

In Turkey \u2014 where the .tr domain is used by schools, local businesses, government institutions, and the Turkish military \u2014 the DDoS attack felt devastating.\n[...]\nMany Turkish commentators have pointed to Russia as the source of the attacks, but it\u2019s difficult, if not impossible, to say with absolute certainty where a cyberattack stems from.

If the OPM hack didn't spark a response of sanctions I doubt anything else could, aside from a crippling cyberinfrastructure attack. Also, it would be hypocritical of America to impose sanctions for cyber operations and everyone knows what the US does in Cyber space since the Snowden documents were released. Because of the Snowden documents I believe the US doesn't want to draw attention to their NSA cyber actions by sanctioning someone else (China), besides I believe the NSA is most technologically competent in cyber war, I'm sure the NSA does whatever they do more  and more effectively than China does whatever they do. Although I might have a jaded view of American capabilities, and maybe China and Russia are more capable in the Cyber domain that I expect. There is also economic damage to be faced if more (civil liberties talk) Cyber operations are debated publically. I would think the above goes for all the 5 eyes nations. In Europe they are too concerned with stopping terrorism, and they don't want to diminish their capacity to spy on people, and if they were to level sanctions against anyone for cyber operations it would open a debate about spying, and that would impede their effectiveness against terrorism. Given the Refugee crisis, I doubt they can risk that. The only potential EU members I could see leveling sanctions (against Russia) are one of the baltic states. However Estonia is pretty capable in the Cyber Domain, (I assume) and has one of the best networked / technological infrastructure cities on earth (or so I have read), and I think as a general rule if you are good at cyber war you don't talk about cyber war, let alone sanction another nation for cyber operations. And if you are a member of a block or alliance with capable allies you generally trust them to help / protect you more than you endanger their ability to conduct cyber operations.   The only caveat would be if Russia and China recognize their adversary's inability to sanction them for cyber operations (or face any real repercussions) and this makes them feel impervious to sanctions, thus hacking more, thus crossing a threshold that some smaller ally (a baltic state for example) can't tolerate, and have to impose sanctions and spark a debate. But this has a low probability in my opinion. Considering a nation state hacking a corporate entity (EG China or Russia hacking Google): corporate entities don't like to talk about hacks because of the financial damage / fallout, so there is little chance a company sparks a debate that necessitates a political response (sanctions).
