Hence I see that it is most likely that there will be 2 of more changes in the seven positions. It is however almost as likely that there will be less than 2 changes to these positions (it is however less likely there will be none). 4 to 5 changes I would see happening in a negative force majeure situation where numerous people holding these positions are seen to have been incompetent in dealing with the situation (e.g. a large country-wide protest movements, natural disaster). 6 to 7 changes I imagine would only happen in a case of regime collapse or possibly Putin discovering/suspecting coup d'etat (initiating Stalin like purges). As of who would be the most likely candidates I have somewhat struggled. I agree with @rids101 I think the most likely candidate would be Alezander Bastrykin having had numerous negative implications recently and himself having little powerbase. Good articles are the ones that that he has shared that give insight into Bastrykin's shaky position. However regarding Dmitri Medvedev I am not as confident. He has had his problems this year but the two recent research papers on Putin's inner circle have placed him to have the most strong position after 2018 presidential elections (see links below). However he would be an easy scapegoat in case Putin wanted to boost his own popularity or blame someone for a negative event just before the elections. There is also been speculation that Putin is will be looking to introduce into the high government positions new more younger officials who on the other hand are more dependent on Putin and thus could be viewed more loyal (Anton Vaino; Alexey Dyumin, Dmitry Mironov & Yevgeny Zinichev trio all who became governors of important regions). Some of these \"new guard\" could also threaten Medvedev's position especially post 2018 elections.\nhttp://minchenko.ru/en/insights/analitics_18.html\nhttps://fpp.spb.ru/fpp-top-successors (Google Translate)\nhttp://carnegieendowment.org/files/Article_Kolesnikov_4_srok_2017_Eng_3.pdf  I myself also see Kozak as a possible person to change position. He apparently is not well liked by others in Putins inner circle. Also is deeply involved in Crimea project which however is costing RUS money and has had its problems. On the other hand he has been named as Putin's \"project guy\" - someone who Putin can trust to run large scale projects - Sochi Olympics, Crimea.\nhttp://www.worldpolicy.org/blog/2016/10/24/crimea-becoming-russian-money-pit  Shoigu and Sechin are probably safe as they have been loyal and have had their fair amount of successes in previous years. It is possible that their positions could come more unstable under the aforementioned force majeure scenarios. Patrushev is hard to place. Has allegedly been given a new portfolio to deal with Balkans recently. However hardline in his approaches to West thus could become cumbersome in case a new \"reset\" with the West is attempted. Again hard to place his standings with Putin.\nhttps://www.politico.eu/article/vladimir-putin-balkans-point-man-nikolai-patrushev/ With Miller there is very little information. Has been holding the position for quite some while, thus could assume has managed to do his job well. It would have made more sense to change him out when oil prices were down and Russia was struggling. Now however the prices are again rising and he can argue that he has managed to help Russia steer out of the rocky waters. Again hard to place his standing with Putin.

Apologies if links have been linked before. First, I\u2019m assuming that 1./ Putin will run (latest thinking is that he might run as an independent) and 2./ Putin will win. The probability of other options at this point seems small but would completely change everything I\u2019m about to write.   @ErikFritzsche has a great analysis of the average baseline durations of service for each of the posts, so I\u2019m not going to run through that again. Noted also that there are several members of cabinet eligible for retirement at this point without having done anything specifically wrong and that it\u2019s possible that some may fall to ill health. I think the only way to factor in the unpredictability around this at a year out is through an additional margin of error. I guess from a Brier Score point of view it won\u2019t do anyone\u2019s averages any good if there is a freak accident at the Russian cabinet and Senior CEOs annual yacht party.  On the trends picture:  Putin fired a swathe of regional governors last year http://www.rt.com/politics/353733-putin-replaces-heads-of-russian/ and Yakunin was shuffled out of Russian Railways in 2015. He also demoted Sergei Ivanov to Transport & Environment in 2016 http://www.ft.com/content/e9c3b756-60d8-11e6-b38c-7b39cbb1138a\n \u2013 easy to see this as part of the trend to replace aging cabinet but there are claims that Ivanov sacked for poor advice/handling of DNC hack http://www.buzzfeed.com/kenbensinger/these-reports-allege-trump-has-deep-ties-to-russia?utm_term=.gx90v4Rvq#.cj5veJle3\n and apparently Yakunin\u2019s corruption was so egregious it pushed even VVP too far http://www.rferl.org/a/russia-railways-yakunin-whistle-blower-corruption/28042893.html, http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/vladimir-putin/11923174/Vladimir-Putin-fires-close-ally-Vladimir-Yakunin-after-son-applied-for-British-citizenship.html. \n\nBearing this in mind I\u2019m not convinced that there is a purge of old hands taking place. Although we can build on the base rates, many in Putin\u2019s inner circle have lasted so long because they are trusted, somewhat competent, and loyal members of the clique. The way I would look at this question therefore is to consider who is in a prime position to be moved through general incompetence or unpopularity. Looking at the names on the list, the top contenders are Bastrykin and Medvedev.   Medvedev: \nReasons he\u2019ll be gone:\n1.\tHe\u2019s unpopular (been covered in previous forecasts by others) http://themoscowtimes.com/articles/Medvedev-is-out-57576\n2.\tThere are potential votes to be gained by sacking an unpopular PM, and Putin may want to demonstrate a direction of movement \n3.\tPutin has form in this department (Kasyanov 2004 http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3521591.stm or Fradkov 2007 , although Putin seems to have personally & politically disliked Kasyanov and was becoming PM in the elections after Fradkov\u2019s removal, so they aren\u2019t exact comparisons) Reasons he might stay:\n1.\tThe stories of his demise have previously been greatly exaggerated... the \u201cMedvedev will get fired soon\u201d story has been swirling for years. http://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-medvedev-idUSBRE93G0JD20130417 It\u2019s worth noting that his approval numbers were around as bad then as now http://www.levada.ru/en/ratings/. Tim Ash thought he was going to be replaced last year, with Alexei Kudrin (who is still a possibility I\u2019d have thought) http://www.ft.com/content/fdb5a2dd-40a9-3bff-b9b5-c1073ab2a118. (Ash's comments are a good example of the difficulty of timing in forecasting!)\n2.\tIt doesn\u2019t seem that his unpopularity is transferring to Putin based on the numbers. Having someone else as the target of opposition anger isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing for any politician, and VVP knows where he stands with DAM\n3.\tFiring him would give succour to Navalny and the opposition, who would surely go for a new target.  Bastrykin: \nReasons he could be gone:\n1.\tHe\u2019s been a long running PR disaster, attracting negative press for threatening to kill a journalist and maintaining businesses abroad, as well as general accusations of incompetence http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/08/the-rise-and-probable-fall-of-putins-enforcer/278577/\n2.\tLast year his office was raided by the FSBs Economic Security Service suggesting he might have enemies in high places http://themoscowtimes.com/news/investigative-committee-head-denounces-betrayal-of-arrested-colleagues-54712 Bastrykin was widely reported to have resigned in September, post elections. He's still in post, but this doesn't exactly say \"long stable tenure ahead\".\n3.\tHe has little power base of his own and has annoyed a number of high ranking officials. There have been rumblings about a new state security service, which could take functions from the Investigative Committee.  Reasons he might stay: \n1.\tHe\u2019s obviously of some use or he would be gone by now given the above. He has patronage from Sechin, although this is considered tepid\n2.\tHe\u2019s been an effective hatchet man for Putin in the past, and having no base of support he is already easy to manage, therefore less likely to be part of any clear out of independent power bases.  Of the remaining figures I can\u2019t see any under specific threat. Alexei Miller appears ostensibly to be doing a decent enough job at Gazprom, and is comparatively young. Igor Sechin, well, if he is toppled, big things are changing. He is a key ally of VVP and ingrained in the Russian system with deep ties to the FSB and patronage over a number of Russia\u2019s ruling class as noted in Bastrykin's case. There is no clear reason I can see that Shoygu would be moved, appears to be popular enough and generally getting on with the job, which is a winning formula if you want to work in the Russian government - any big Syrian reversals could affect his position.  Patrushev seems to have been given Balkan responsibility lately http://www.politico.eu/article/vladimir-putin-balkans-point-man-nikolai-patrushev/ but I\u2019d suggest that\u2019s probably consistent with being seen as someone who is trusted to do a good job \u2013 although he is one of the older members of the group I\u2019ve yet to see or hear anything that makes me doubt his position.  So, bearing that in mind, for my thoughts from the perspective of answering the question:  0-1: Possible. I\u2019ve identified two men who have every reason to be moved on. Yet both have survived in difficult circumstances before. Conversely, given the elections and associated political pressures it is more than possible that someone not considered at risk in my analysis could become at risk before July 2018, even if Medvedev and Bastrykin don\u2019t move.  2-3: Also possible, and I think most likely. Loyalty or not, elections are a great time to move troublesome people, and I have identified two which means there is a margin of error upwards built into this bucket, which might be necessary given the long time horizon.  4-5: Less likely. 4-5 leaving would be quite an overhaul and rebalancing of the system \u2013 perhaps unprecedented in the time period remaining and the seniority of the figures? Incremental moves at the top would preserve stability better, and I can\u2019t see that 4 of the listed men are in such a precarious position that their moves are necessitated. Conversely, I could imagine that three could be shuffled or fired within the next 12 months, which would suggest a margin of error ought to be considered towards the possibility of a fourth. 6-7: probably only with a change in President or a serious sweeping away of the current system. Even if 6 were moved I don\u2019t see them all leaving the cabinet/CEO roles.

While it is not difficult to predict the very probable victor, the question is whether a new presidential term will usher in an overhaul of state officials.    One partial past precedent: Shortly before his election to a second term of office (in 2004) Putin did appoint a new PM (Mikhail Fradkov) as part of a relatively radical overhaul of the government structures (and great reduction in the numebr of ministries): the way this was done seemed to be using a governmental reorganization almost as part of an electoral pledge or ploy. It's not inconcievable something similar could occur shortly before the 2018 presidential election. One other slightly more tangentially related precedent: in his final months as President in 2012, Medvedev dismissed a substantial number of regional governors - mostly slightly secondary positions compared with the seven posts discussed here, but including a couple of great importance eg Mayor of Moscow - as a way of overhauling the state apparatus/personnel. Of these seven officials , several are long-term close allies of Putin: Patrushev has held his current post since 2008, but was director of the FSB since 1999 (indeed, Putin's successor in that role).  Shoigu (often portrayed as a safe pair of hands, even a potential successor to Putin, but his ethnic and religious minority - Buddhist - status maybe count against him there) goes back even further; his current position is since 2012, but he was Minister of Emergency Situations from in an unbroken period from 1991 to 2012. Miller has been Gazprom CEO since 2001. Kozak has held his current position since 2008, but held other senior positions under Putin earlier in the decade.  Sechin has worked with or for Putin since at least the early 1990s when they were involved in St Petersburg City authorities. Considering their ages: Patrushev is the oldest (66) , Medvedev the youngest (52). Other questions: how long do holders of these positions typically stay in post?\nBastrykin (appt 2011) is the first person to hold this specific post. The Gazprom and Rosneft posts are essentially new ones too.  \nRussian Ministers of Defence have tended to stay in office between around four to six years over the past 20 years or so, so Shoigu could be vulnerable here. In general there has been something of a stability of cadres in the upper echelons of the Russian state sand state-linked bodies ince Putin first came to power in 2000. But the need to cultivate a younger generation, younger than Medvedev, couid eventually bring sweeping changes.  My initial thoughts are that Bastrykin is probably the most vulnerable; Shoigu  may not stay in his current post, but be moved to another senior role. Not sure Kozak is so essential as he once was.
