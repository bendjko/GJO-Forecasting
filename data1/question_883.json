A quick peak at imbd shows that she has been nominated for a number of critic's circles awards, etc. for Mudbound but has only won one such award (New York film critics circle).

There have been several discussions of gender issues that might tip an undecided jury towards a female nominee. I estimate this might give the film a 2% advantage.
