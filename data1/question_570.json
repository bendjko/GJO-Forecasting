Whether you throw out the two extremes, or allow them to cancel each other out, it wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable to assume the current rating would increase by around 4. Also, Abe has replaced the defense minister and re-shuffled his cabinet in an effort to increase his (and his cabinet\u2019s) approval rating.  It\u2019s not unreasonable to assume the public reaction would be positive, rather than negative. Additionally, the approval rating was 58% just 7 months ago.  I think there\u2019s an argument to be made for regression to the mean after the steep decline due to the defense minister scandal. Offsetting these arguments is the Kyodo poll showing no change in the approval rating.
