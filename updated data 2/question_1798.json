The exact value I am not sure but maybe my previous forecast may help to answer which method is closest pending the outcome to this question. It may surely be close to the value of 2.00. I have found that the overall trend of delinquency rate has gone down over the decades, with the most recent anomaly being around the financial crisis of 2008. In this case, I found that the home price index in the U.S. dropped while delinquency rates skyrocketed way above the mean, then petered off when the delinquency rates started falling from its peak around 2009. Assuming they are correlated somehow, maybe even indirectly causing each other, I see that the home price index in the past year or two has not dropped but is in fact increasing. With this logic, we should see delinquency rates remaining stable or decreasing. Again, this is a hypothesis I would want to see play out. How I can see my forecast to be wrong is that the upward trend is more free to \"go crazy\" because we have already seen a rise in the last year. There has been an instance the rise comes back down before it could go out of hand, but we cannot rule out a surge. I can see my forecast going wrong if this trend exponentially increases. The thinking is that it will be above 1 and below 2, but that's very little wiggle room and UP is the favorite versus down.

How far is 2008 / 2009 comparable - since this was a pure real estate crisis / financial crisis in the first place and not an pandemic? I believe a comparison is helpful but only in some respects: 2008 / 09 were mainly consumers in the residential sector - so commercial real estate was less hit nevertheless the rates jumped above 8.6 at the peak. So theoretically it should  be possible that this time since office, retail, hotel and restaurants are even more severlly hit that we see similar new height.  On the other hand  this time politicians and the FED acted even quicker and more generous but how much this will help real businesses is the crucial question. I strongly believe that rates will pass 4.00 % easily but more in the form of a backlog or as Jeremy Grantham said a slow motion train wreck that slowly but surely shows its effect.  Liquidity crunch and everything that hinges indirectly on it like delinquincy rates are like a train crash . So my assesment weighing all the counteracting forces is, that we will see similar peaks but the time horizont in this question is too short to show the real effects until it works itself fully through the system, Next update in around 2 - 3 weeks when Fred data for Q1 are released and since in 2008 / 09 these effects are slow but sure adjustment in one direction or the other are made.

Looking at the FRED plot though it\u2019s been climbing by only 0.1-0.2 per quarter for the past several quarters. That puts the outside rate at almost definitely below 2%, high end growth by historic standards would put the rate at about 1.6%, and low end around 1.4%.  Going by news in the CRE world it seems like that a spike didn\u2019t happen is because most of the loans that would\u2019ve gone delinquent, mostly in the hospitality sector, we restructured rather than allowing the loan recipient to go into delinquency. This was done for COVID but not 2008 because of a section of the CARES act that allows for loans that would normally be considered troubled debt restructurings to be restructured without the reporting requirements and likely associated hit to the lender\u2019s credit rating. The idea seems to be to incentivize banks to work out new agreements with tenants, helping tenants avoid delinquency being on their credit history, and letting banks not report large chunks of their loans as impaired and having their balance sheets look worse to the outside world.  If that\u2019s the main reason that delinquency has been so low, it probably won\u2019t be changing any time soon. The clause of the CARES act that allows for different treatment of TDRs under GAAP was renewed in the December 2020 stimulus through 2022 or 60 days after the end of the national emergency (https://www.natlawreview.com/article/federal-covid-relief-bill-passed-congress-december-2020) . The same incentives remain for both lenders and recipients to avoid delinquency, and the same provisions remain in place to allow them to avoid it.  I reserve some probability for a sharp increase though. A lot of would-be-TDRs were probably done at the beginning of the pandemic with a one year term for the agreement which would need to be updated soon. Most people at the beginning of the pandemic were expecting lockdowns to last a few months tops, and now that it\u2019s become clear that the effects will be much larger and long-lasting than was expected when the first round of would-be-TDRs were done. This may mean that some tenants or lenders will decide that it\u2019s better to just eat the loss from a bad loan, rather than continue paying even at a reduced rate since business won\u2019t be coming back, which will lead to some going into delinquency. I\u2019m not sure what the agreements actually look like or in what state many of the tenants are in (which was kind of the point of the provision), so it\u2019s hard to say how likely this type of scenario actually is. It\u2019s also hard to say if delinquency will be a common choice, since I\u2019m not sure how often it will be in anybody\u2019s best interest given the TDR options on the table, as well as pandemic relief programs that can be used to help tenants meet their loan payments.   Even in a bad scenario, the sharpest growth from 2008 was about 0.75 per quarter, and we\u2019d need at least one quarter with growth on that level to have a shot at going over 2%, so I don\u2019t assign it a huge weight.

At this point unemployment is still very high. I believe the economy was already heading for a recession and the pandemic has simply uncovered problems that were already in existence. What matters is the size of the bubble, not the size of the pin; the pandemic was the pin. There are lasting problems for the commercial real estate market that will not be solved by fixing covid. Inflation is rising; I believe it will be at least 3% going forward. Inflation is ultimately what is going to destroy this economy. The only tool government has to combat this is printing more money and handing it out, which will only accelerate the inflation.  There's a continued trend of people moving out of the big cities to more rural areas, partially because of work from home, and partially because of a desire to flee the continued political unrest. Also, many amenities that used to be in place for city living are no longer available. I think things are very bad for the commercial real estate market long-term. Over 100,000 restaurants have gone out of business. 61% of restaurants and 35% of small businesses could not pay their rent in December.  However, there are some things that have been implemented that will push out the damage until later. I think this is very bad policy for the economy, because it is simply encouraging unprofitable businesses to stay in place. For purposes of this question though it means that default rates won't jump as quickly as they otherwise would. These new policies include PPP loans (which are really grants) to businesses and a restructuring of the bankruptcy market which allows tenants to be in place for an additional 90 days longer than the otherwise would be. I don't think the historical trends tell us very much. What is going on now is unprecedented. Much worse than 2008 ultimately. I think that despite the PPP loans and bankruptcy restructuring there will be many business owners that will opt to simply cash in their chips because they see the writing on the wall for their business. https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/commercial-real-estate-bankruptcy-legislation-introduced https://www.zerohedge.com/personal-finance/work-home-threatens-commercial-real-estate-valuations https://www.zerohedge.com/personal-finance/us-has-lost-more-110000-restaurants-setting-stage-commercial-real-estate-collapse https://cms.zerohedge.com/economics/record-61-restaurants-35-small-businesses-cant-pay-december-rent?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+zerohedge%2Ffeed+%28zero+hedge+-+on+a+long+enough+timeline%2C+the+survival+rate+for+everyone+drops+to+zero%29"], [1333, "2021-01-19T14:21:05Z", [0.02, 0.52, 0.44, 0.02, 0.0], ""], [86233, "2021-01-18T20:59:45Z", [0.2, 0.64, 0.15, 0.01, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2021-01-18T08:17:47Z", [0.02, 0.51, 0.45, 0.02, 0.0], ""], [88198, "2021-01-18T03:46:06Z", [0.12, 0.42, 0.4, 0.04, 0.02], ""], [13306, "2021-01-17T03:03:30Z", [0.05, 0.6, 0.25, 0.07, 0.03], ""], [1333, "2021-01-16T14:11:28Z", [0.02, 0.5, 0.46, 0.02, 0.0], ""], [40584, "2021-01-15T16:15:02Z", [0.45, 0.5, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [87827, "2021-01-15T15:25:20Z", [0.4, 0.55, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0], "Going up on under 2.

Interest rates are critical to both bank lending, and construction/real estate activities. Right now the interest rate is effectively 0, so the government is giving away money, or alternatively, the value of the dollar is zero.  However, if anyone out there agrees with the fed, feel free to send me your worthless US dollars.\nSo if the dollar is NOT worthless, but banks are lending money based on the Fed's actions, that seems to be very risky on the lending side and highly advantage to developer/real estate borrowers (bubble).  So real estate owners have little risk, the default rate we're trying to forecast should be low.

The recent boom ended abruptly, and more so than the boom before the \"Great Recession\", and the recent boom appears to have been even \"healthier\" before the pandemic than in 2006: the current low was 0.67% (Q2 2019), the low point in Q2 2006 was at 1.02%. \nProjecting forward, we will have to predict the rate four quarters from now, since the latest of the quarterly figures is \"as of 30 June 2020/Q2 2020\", so there will be four more publications until resolution: Q3, Q4 2020 plus Q1, Q2 2021, of which Q3 2020 is due to be published probably in October 2020. From the overview table one can see that the commercial real estate loan business in general has the lowest delinquency rates of all, which may correlate to the larger sums in the game and the intense risk assessment on the one hand, and on the other hand more professional approach of commercial debtors and businesses being better equipped with equity and cash than any other sector. However, after the boom ends, the (DRCRELEXFACBS) rate tends to rise much faster than other sectors, which can be observed already in the four quarters Q2 2019 to Q2 2020: Q2 2019: 0.67%\nQ2 2020: 0.92% (+37.31%)\nof which the quarters\nQ1 2020 (the third quarter after cyclical low; +22.1% quarter over quarter) and \nQ2 2020 (the fourth quarter after cyclical low; +10.8% quarter over quarter)\nsaw the fastest pace.\nIt is a bit surprising that the increase of delinquency rates has already begun for real *before* the pandemic actually began, so in my reading even without SARS-CoV-2 the US economy has likely been in the beginning of a cyclical recession. For comparison All Loans (DRALACBS):\nQ2 2019: 1.49%\nQ2 2020: 1.54% (+3.36%) For the purpose of a projection, one can try to replicate the growth of delinquency of the quarters Q3 2007 to Q2 2008, if one assumed the evolution of the crisis will be equivalent. However, as the pandemic came as a surprise and an \"external economic shock\" and the federal subsidies for cash-strapped businesses and interventions by the Federal Reserve System are, in my opinion, much bigger and more significant in 2020 than it was the case in Q3 2007 to Q2 2008, so it is likely the dispersion of growth rates quarter over quarter will be different: the highest impact was right at the beginning in Q1 2020, and after the loan market had time to adapt to the shock, growth rates are expected to be slightly lower than in the historic precedent. Under these assumtions, I get to the following projection: The historic precedent:\nQ4 2006: 1.32%\nQ1 2007: 1.43% (+8.33%)\nQ2 2007: 1.63% (+13.99%)\nQ3 2007: 1.97% (+ 20.86%)\nQ4 2007: 2.75% (+39.60%)\nQ1 2008: 3.50% (+27.27%)\nQ2 2008: 4.16% (+18.86%) Projection until Q2 2021:\nQ4 2019: 0.68\nQ1 2020: 0.83% (+22.06%)\nQ2 2020: 0.92% (+10.84%)\nQ3 2020: 1.086%est. (+18.0%est.)\nQ4 2020: 1.487%est. (+37.0%est.)\nQ1 2021: 1.859%est. (+25.0%est.)\nQ2 2021: 2.175%est. (+17.0%est.) I would consider this the best case scenario, since it includes the assumption that deliquencies will be able to adjourned until a vaccine is in place and widely available, so the pandemic conditions are basically over before the vast limitations for businesses can cause major persistent damage on the commercial real estate loan market. However, I rule out that - even under the most advantageous conditions - the delinquency rate will remain below 2.00% and thus I rule out bin 1. However, considering the \"big picture\", there is an alternative projection method and a different solution, which will serve as the normal case scenario henceforth.\nIf you compare commercial real estate loans with all loans (DRALACBS) historically, they have an intersection pretty much at the beginning of the underlying recession, which means that (DRCRELEXFACBS) not only catches up but lies higher than the all loans in the recession, which started statistically in Q1 2020 if I remember correctly. This means the pandemic effect would exacerbate the delinquency rate in commercial real estate segment to unprecedented growth rates of maybe 50% to 100% qoq in Q3 2020, caused maybe by consumer behavior, limitations to consumer lending and thus spending, higher unemployment and less disposable income and so forth. The publication of the next figures per Q3 2020 will give more insight over the path ahead!\nIn figures, this would mean:\nQ2 2020: 0.92%\nQ3 2020 est. (+50%): 1.38%\nQ3 2020 est. (+100%): 1.84% For comparison, All loans (DRALACBS) figure:\nQ2 2020: 1.54%\nQ3 2020 est. (+10%): 1.694% This would constitute a totally different growth path, at the end of which over four quarters a rate in the high 4% or 5% can not be excluded - and which is why GJO likely asked exactly this question exactly now. A mark-up will be used to reflect this effect to retrieve the worst case scenario further below. As per historical precedent, delinquencies in commercial real estate loans (DRCRELEXFACBS) grew\nQ2 2006: 1.02%\nQ2 2008: 4.16% (+307.8%) Q2 2019:  0.67%\nQ2 2021 est. (+307.8%): 2.73% (normal case scenario, which is still 34,4% below the value of the \"Great Recession\", at 4.16%) As a markup to the pandemic effect, I choose to take the average of Q2 2019 of All loans and commercial real estate loans, which lies at 1.08% ((0.67%+1.49%)/2) (Q2 2019*) to correct for the fact that one third up to half of the businesses' investment decision would certainly not have been made between Q2 2019 and Q4 2019, if decision makers had known that there would be pandemic in 2020 and a complete lock down in many places in the US in Q2 2020. Thus, with the imaginary starting point of 1.08% in Q2 2019 and the real growth rate retrieved from historic precedent, I receive my worst case scenario for the time being (which could definitely become worse, depending on Q3 2020 figures published): Q2 2019*:1.08%\nQ2 2021* est. (+307.8%): 4.40% My forecast reflects that the best case and the normal case lie on bin 2 pretty far off of the threshold to the upper side, but also that the worst case already lies on bin 3, and that there's a significant risk the \"worst case\" could be topped by reality.\nMy conclusion is that the commercial real estate loans sector will observe fast rising delinquency rates (DRCRELEXFACBS) over the next four quarters and delinquencies will rise much faster than for the average \"all loans\" segment (DRALACBS). My scenarios are\n/2.175% (best case; 10% weight)\n/2.733% (normal case; 10% weight)\n/4.405% (worst case; 80% weight)\nwhich is why I my weighted average forecast of 4.015% is right on the threshold between bin 2 and bin 3, at least until the figures for Q3 2020 are published. Delinquency rates of 6.00% or higher are very likely in this business cycle, but from my point of view they are not going to be observed before Q4 2021 for the commercial real estate loan market."], [87155, "2020-10-04T06:31:43Z", [0.02, 0.28, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1], ""], [1333, "2020-10-03T18:06:31Z", [0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.35, 0.35], ""], [691, "2020-10-03T15:31:16Z", [0.01, 0.16, 0.38, 0.35, 0.1], ""], [88669, "2020-10-03T12:58:23Z", [0.03, 0.35, 0.5, 0.1, 0.02], ""], [40584, "2020-10-03T12:43:09Z", [0.15, 0.4, 0.3, 0.1, 0.05], ""], [40584, "2020-10-03T12:40:34Z", [0.1, 0.25, 0.3, 0.25, 0.1], ""], [93028, "2020-10-03T11:06:14Z", [0.02, 0.34, 0.42, 0.21, 0.01], "thinking along the lines of \nhttps://www.gjopen.com/comments/1149956\nand\nhttps://www.gjopen.com/comments/1150372\nyet I expect more money to be provided to work in order to ease transition to socially distanced society or to bridge time until return to fairly normal if possible - since both require the same action for the next year(s).

Current rates are really low.. in the 0.7% range. That's lower than the 2000s recession and much lower than 2010. So lots of room to grow. Only numbers out right now are Q2 2020 numbers when the CARES act was in affect so Q3 2020 will be important to watch. Let's pretend like it's 2008 and say we're at the beginning of that curve up (Q2 2007). After 4 quarters, the delinquency rate had only raised by 2.5%. If you go for a more aggressive version of this and say we start right at the beginning of the recession (Q1 2008), then even that rate of increase is only a 3% increase over 4 quarters. What could make this worse than 2008? Certainly that there might be a lot of pent up loan delinquencies coming. On the other hand, there could be a lot of desire to keep tenants. Companies that own/loan commercial real estate certainly understand the shift to online shopping, working from home, online services. Can't imagine they're super thrilled about the idea of killing their revenue stream only to have no way to fill it. Might be against the grain, but based on all that. The high end of 2008 says we could raise as high as 4%.

Gut is to weight mid-high bins most heavily. Poking around a bit, the huge delta between commercial bank and CMBS loan spikes in Q2 is really striking. [1] It may be worth noting here that in the Great Recession, CMBS delinquencies tracked roughly about 450 bps higher than commercial loans. With CMBS nearing 10% in 2Q2020, if the same relationship were to follow here, that would support, in my estimation, weighting bins 3-5 heavily, with the fattest part of the curve in bin 4 or 5. Inside View - This is my industry, and my anecdotal/small sample size experience is that banks really don't want to be taking back properties right now, and are thus executing forebearance agreements (typically allowing for interest-only payments in three-month increments) left and right, thus mitigating the number of loans that become delinquent in the first place. I'm mostly ignoring this inside view for the moment...
