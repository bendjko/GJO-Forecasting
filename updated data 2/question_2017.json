The number of new housing starts took a significant dip in the late 2000s due to the housing crisis, but has been steadily climbing back to pre-recession levels ever since. There did exist another downturn in mid-2020, most likely due to a combination of the pandemic and the high cost of building materials, but even this was not enough to affect the rate for long and it has since rebounded and is continuing its upward trajectory. According to the U.S. Census Bureau and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (2021), as of August of this year there were 1,615,000 Housing starts, a 3.9% increase above July predictions and 17.4% increase from the same time in 2020. The number of new housing starts has been flirting with the 1.6 million mark since the beginning of 2021, making an accurate prediction around this specific number difficult. According to the website ipropertymanagement.com (2021), 2020 saw 1.4 million new housing starts while the last 12 months from the time of this writing has seen the threshold number of 1.6 million. Being as this represents 95.2% of the total number of issued housing permits, an extremely high number, fluctuation is extremely possible and could result in the actual amount for October falling on either side of the line. Despite this, my prediction is that the U.S. will see a continued upward trend in new housing starts, passing the 1.6 million barrier but remaining significantly south of the nest 1.8 million threshold. I place the confidence level of this prediction at 90%, with the remaining 10% allocated to the more conservative estimate of between 1.4 and 1.6 million.

There was a 3.93% increase in housing starts in August, after a decrease in July that was preceded by three months of continued increases. Given that many of the factors affecting the housing market have remained in a fairly consistent range since the last reported housing starts, I believe housing starts for October will remain in that range. I believe the end of coronavirus relief (eviction moratorium and unemployment), the slightly increasing mortgage rate (consistently above 3% since 9/17/2021), and ongoing material + labor shortages will prevent the October rate from exceeding 1.799 million.

The market as of right now, and as the short synopsis suggest, is being widely affected by lumber shortages and other shortages with other materials. There is also the factor of labor shortages as of right now. While new single family units and homes will continue to be built, I don\u2019t see any sign of a massive proliferation any time soon nor a decline. I think it will stay stagnant. As for less or more, the housing market, especially as it applies to new build has a volatility of its own. Therefore I\u2019m scoring it for 20% less and 20% for more. The state of the economy however I believe will deter a number of people away from building as the cost may not outweigh the risk. With that said, there still appears to be proliferation of younger people moving to the suburbs.

Yet the trend has also consistently topped 1.6 million starts over the last several months for the first time since the Recession. With that in mind, it would likely be impossible to ramp up building capacity to over 2 million from where it is not, but the possibility of 1.8-2.0 million starts is possible if not highly unlikely. More likely, starts will stay consistent with the trend\u00a0 between 1.6 and 1.8 million.\u00a0 Now onto the lower bounds: in order for starts to drop below 1.4m, something drastic would have to happen in the market to force a ~20% drop in current trends. Inflation is the most obvious culprit because it makes housing construction more expensive-- yet inflation has been consistently rising since Biden took office and housing starts still reached a post-Covid high. Covid itself could present another curve ball, but with the vast majority of the country having either vaccinated or natural immunity it is unlikely to have a major impact on the housing market at this point. Lastly, mortgage rates would have to sky rocket to really reduce the number of starts, which, despite their modest fluctuation, doesn't seem too likely. That narrows it down between 1.4-1.6 and 1.6-1.8 million as the two most likely scenarios, consistent with recent and long term trends as well as external constraints. In August 2021 there were 1.615 starts, right on the cusp-- so it can go either direction. Some Fermi questions we might consider from here are whether people have money to build houses and what the seasonal constraints are.\u00a0 A 2019 Census Bureau Report finds that houses take an average of 7 months to build from start to finish-- so a housing start in October would run primarily through the winter. Building a house during the winter increases costs (on site heating, snow clearing) and reduces productivity with shorter hours of daylight. Couple that with labor shortages and the cost of hiring construction workers goes up a great deal. With inflation as high as it is, home starts might be reduced from the current trend in order to save a little extra cash after the winter in the hopes of more favorable (seasonal and financial) conditions. Yet people are fed up with Covid and have extra money in their pockets from 2 years of staying home, so those who can afford it may just want to get their home built rather than putting it off any longer to save a few extra bucks. This would be a smaller, wealthier, segment of the population however.\u00a0 Thus, I think a declining trend to 1.4-1.6 is most likely, but a steady trend between 1.6-1.8 is not unreasonable either.\u00a0"], [102361, "2021-10-10T14:10:08Z", [0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0], "On 18 August 2021, Trading and Economics reported a 7% decrease to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.543 million units in July of 2021, while on 21 September 2021, housing in the US was up 3.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.615 million units August of 2021, rebounding from a downwardly revised 6.2% fall in July beating market forecasts of 1.554 million (2021).

There seems to be a sort of trend where units typically increase in October, only for it to begin significant declines by December.

Further elaborating on this, the only decline lower than the 10 year decline cycle occurred in October-1966 between 1960 to 1970.  However, in between these 10 years, typically 2-5, there are significant rises in units. The only time this decline didn't occur in the 10 year cycle didn't occur was between 1990 to 2000. What's even more interesting about the years after 1990 is how the graph becomes consistent. Unlike the years prior to 1990, the grap shows a start contrast in fluctuations. But the years after 1990 shows great consistency before plummeting. To support this, from 2000 to 2010, a massive spike occurred.

The benefit of the annual rate is that not only can one monthly estimate be compared with another; monthly data can also be compared with an annual total.

Considering all the positive trending data and infusion projects the single greatest element I feel will have an impact on the SAAR for Oct 2021 statistics is the ending of forbearances put in place during COVID-19 to forestall foreclosures and evictions that expire at the end of September, directly impacting Oct Housing sector activities.  The extended periods of coverage combined with the massive return to work statistics (even though many sectors are still in the negative for workforce requirements) the general population has the capital to return to the housing market increasingly each month, the months of suspended debt and debt requirements will allow property owners to return to eviction processes and provide recourse for lost revenue.  These actions to recoup will assuredly affect individuals who would be participating in the requesting of permits, builds, and sales.  \nHaving said this, I still believe that the amount of individuals returning to work at approximately 700,000 per month, government subsidies, and constant home overvalutation will persist through the month of September and affect the Oct \u201921 publication numbers but will increase only slightly to the tune of approximately 1% at near 1,650,000.

I have used data from FRED in the past to make forecasts of economic data, and this is little different. I started by gathering potential explanatory variables from the FRED database. I began my analysis with the following variables: \u2022\tDate\n\u2022\tExisting Single-Family Home Sales\n\u2022\tMedian Number of Months on Sales Market for Newly Completed Homes\n\u2022\tMonthly Supply of Houses in the United States\n\u2022\tNew Houses Sold by Stage of Construction, Not Started\n\u2022\tNew One Family Homes for Sale in the United States\n\u2022\tNew Privately-Owned Housing Units Authorized but Not Started: Total\n\u2022\tNew Privately-Owned Housing Units Authorized in Permit-Issuing Places:\n\u2022\tNew Privately-Owned Housing Units Started: Total Units\n\u2022\tProducer Price Index by Commodity: Lumber and Wood Products: Lumber My dependent variable was New Privately-Owned Housing Units Started: Total Units advanced by two months. In other words, my model was designed to use data from January to forecast the value of housing starts in March. This is necessary because the most recent data available in the FRED data sets is from August, with which I must forecast October. After doing multiple regression analysis on these as well as lagged versions of these, I ended up with the following variables in my regression model, all but one of which were significant at the 2% level or better. The least significant variable was Permits (lagged 3 months) at 6.07%. All data is sourced from the FRED database by the names shown. \u2022\tNew Privately-Owned Housing Units Authorized but Not Started: Total\n\u2022\tMedian Number of Months on Sales Market for Newly Completed Homes\n\u2022\tMonthly Supply of Houses in the United States\n\u2022\tNew Houses Sold by Stage of Construction, Not Started\n\u2022\t[Lagged 3 months] New Privately-Owned Housing Units Authorized in Permit-Issuing Places The resulting model has an R2 of .9248 and a Standard Error of 82.43. This translates to a 95% confidence interval of +/- 163,100 housing starts. Given the range of selections in the GJP are in 200,000 house intervals this seems like an acceptable degree of confidence.\n\nBased on August 2021 values for my independent variables, my model predicts 1,688 housing starts in October 2021. There is 95% confidence the actual number of starts will be between 1,525 and 1,851. Specifically, the GJP asks for confidence related to levels of 1.4M - 1.6M, and 1.6M - 1.8M. My model suggests that the probability of starts being less than 1.4M is negligible (.0003), the probability of starts being below 1.6M is .144, the probability of being below 1.8M is .912, and being below 2.0M is .999.\nThus my confidence in the 1.4M to 1.6M range is 14%, my confidence in the 1.6M to 1.8M range is 77%, and my confidence in the 1.8M to 2.0M range is 9%."], [102861, "2021-10-08T03:07:17Z", [0.05, 0.37, 0.52, 0.05, 0.01], "Reason: According to the 5 year trend from Trading Economics the annualized rate of housing dips around October of every year following a spike in the summer months, a decline, and then an upward trend which falls in November or December.

Also, as the U.S. is on an upward recover from the pandemic, there is a likely chance that the housing market and economy will be steady making a probable outcome that housing starts will stay around 1.6 million. Lumber prices are a factor as well to housing starts, which in July, lumber was at its lowest price. This resulted in more housing starts in August. As of Oct 1st, lumber prices are in a slight incline which could lower housing starts but its marginal, which it will stay close to 1.6 million.

This increase of housing starts is likely to increase for September as the price for lumber continues to drop and get back to a more average price for lumber. Climate plays a big part how people spend money. Most people would think building a new house makes more sense in the spring/summer time frame, but as the numbers have shown, even with an increase in price of lumber, the numbers for July are down. I contribute this to a reciprocal thought, where the average house takes 9 months to build. Let's say October for instance, you lay the foundation and 9 months later (June/July) your house is complete. This allows parents with children the ability to move in when the weather is good and school is out of session. This forecast may change slightly after the September numbers are released on 19OCT.

Last time we were above 2M units was October 2005, so I'm very much discounting that number. Now the most interesting thing is that the band is fairly narrow given that Dec 2018 was down at 1.095M units and we peaked at 1.733M units in March 2021. Using the indicators above as a good starting point here is what I see that I am weighing into my prediction. 1. Lumber prices are bonkers - back in April it was $1074 . Now it is off the high of $1645, but still sticking around $1327 for the spot price. I don't know what units lumber is traded in, but we're at a 23% premium relative to prices then and that makes building very costly. 2. Labor is likely in good supply, but we might be peaking at the number of qualified laborers given current market conditions. I don't know this well enough to have a decisive conclusion, but I suspect that so many people in construction have been sidelined that it may be more difficult to find builders than one would necessarily expect. My friend who tiles says that a ton of people are also looking for remodels on their existing houses, so that takes up supply as well. 3. Mortgage rates seem to be climbing slowly but surely. November - January was 2.68 - 2.74 and we are now at 2.96 for the latest month with the two prior months being over 3% for rates. This will slightly suppress demand as well because it is not as cheap to buy as it was previously. This means fewer homeowners buying. Overall, there is a huge pent up demand for housing in this country - mostly in urban and suburban areas with rural areas finding themselves losing population to larger cities with more opportunity. This is the biggest factor driving the production higher.

The plunge in homebuilding reported by the Commerce Department on Tuesday was concentrated in the single-family housing market segment. The number of houses authorized for construction but not yet started increased to the highest level since 1999, suggesting hesitancy on the part of builders. Housing starts tumbled 9.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.569 million units last month. Data for March was revised lower to a rate of 1.733 million units, still the highest level since June 2006, from the previously reported 1.739 million units.
