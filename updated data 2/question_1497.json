The TSJ ruling coincides with negotiations to elect a Supreme Electoral Council (CNE) with a view to parliamentary elections scheduled for this year, around which no progress has been reported.  \"The reactivation of the nominations committee (for the CNE) will depend on the political climate,\" Guaid\u00f3 said Thursday, stressing that the Legislative is investigating Parra and his allies for alleged bribes.  On Tuesday, Parra summoned that committee to resume the talks.\nUpshot: It sounds like Guaido has some power and they are not taking him on directly.

Guaido arrived back in Venezuela 3 days before that statement and he was not arrested or detained. Maduro said \u201cthat day hasn\u2019t come yet\u2026 But it will come\u201d. Apparently, he is waiting for Venezuela\u2019s justice system to decide that Guaido should be imprisoned. \n\nFast forward to last month, State prosecutors in Venezuela have summoned Guaido for an attempted coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, adding to the long list of legal cases against Guaido. Despite this, he has never been arrested and I doubt this case alone will change his chances of arrest or detainment in the short term. \n\nThe incentive to arrest or detain Guaido peaked last year and was matched by the opportunity to do so. A shattered economy, multiple protests, and snowballing support for Guaido put pressure on Maduro to act. He did not arrest or detain him because it would have been political suicide. \n\nMaduro will know that arresting/detaining Guaido in the middle of huge protests would add fuel to the fire. It would bolster his support and portray him as the oppressed anti-Maduro figurehead to Venezuelans. Furthermore, the United States has warned Maduro that arresting Guaido would be his \u201clast mistake\u201d. \n\nIn my opinion Venezuela is about to go through some extraordinarily turbulent times, starting imminently. COVID-19, the oil crisis (including Rosneft stopping operations in Venezuela), inflation, emigration, and sanctions will desecrate its economy even further. If past trends continue this will trigger mass protests. This means the arrest or detainment of Guaido would be unlikely. \n\nHowever, Maduro may believe that arresting Guaido will prevent protests from growing in intensity. It may even get to a point where he has nothing to lose. Maduro tried to consolidate his power recently (extrajudicial killings) and may feel that the repercussions of actions are now smaller. There could be an accidental arrest or an arrest that has not been authorised by Maduro. A protest is a perfect environment for this. Furthermore, Guaido may commit a serious criminal offense by the end of this year which leads to his arrest or detainment. \n\nGuaido is backed very strongly by the United States. If there is intelligence that an arrest is imminent, he may be granted asylum or some form of protection. However, a previous assassination attempt showcased his vulnerability to such events. \n\nThe new $15 million bounty for information resulting in Maduro's arrest slightly increases the chances of him vacating office. This would drastically reduce the chances of Guaido being detained.\n\nOverall, I believe arresting or detaining Guaido would be very damaging to Maduro. A skilled and experienced political player such as himself will surely know this. However, if the legal case against Guaido starts to intensify it would increase the chances of arrest. An unauthorized arrest/mistake is a possibility, but it is unlikely. Maduro has been in many very difficult situations before and always seems to find a way to survive. However, the current unprecedented events may cause unexpected outcomes.

That would make it an average of about .8 of a person detained per year.  The prisoners of note being Leopolda Gomez, Caracas Mayor Antonio Ledezma, and someone else that I cannot find right now [2]. For context on them being in prison comes directly after they criticized Maduros authoritarian regime. However as a third note, there have only been three events that lead to four arrests. So I am going to focus on the events.  If we do some quick back of the envelope calculations, if there have been three arrest \"events\" over the last 7 years for major political players . That would lead me to think that there is approximate a 42% chance that  Maduro will arrest Guiado this year.   42% will be my baserate to start with.  ~~~~~~\nInside View\n~~~~~~\nNow we have to start answering some questions. AKA What will it take for this to happen.\n1. Guado will have to be in Venezuala at some point or points this  year. \n2. Maduro will not have to care about international consequences if he does arrest Guado\n3. There will have to be some in sighting incident  for Maduro to make a move to arrest Guado (perhaps it already has happened)\n4. Venezula's improvement of the economy makes Guado irrelevant\n5. People will still care about Guado \n6. International pressure drops off against Maduro ~~~~~~~\nConclusion\n~~~~~~~\nThere are a lot of variables to consider for this question, many of which are difficult to quantify as of right now.

This way, Maduro can blunt any international criticism that would otherwise be directed his way as a consequence of Guaido's arrest.  However, this is a strategy that Maduro could have employed previously and he has thus far chosen not to. Hence, I still think it is more likely than not that Guaido will not be arrested in the time frame of this question - namely because the regime probably doesn't want to face the blowback from arresting Guaido - \"it's unlikely Maduro would risk escalating international tension by detaining Guaido\" [2].

Recently, Guaido made an appearance at the State of the Union address which shows an increasing support from the United States. Even though this increased pressure and interest in supporting the opposition leader from the US does seem as if it could boost morale among protesters, I think that this is more of a gesture that the US president is using to secure support from his Latino constituents. Guaido has also been calling for more protests in order to put pressure on Maduro, however, I believe that the fear tactics of the Maduro regime have been putting more pressure on Guaido because people are starting to weigh their decisions based on their growing fears. With all of these combined factors, I will update my probability to 38% simply because protests have not been increasing, but Guaido's appearance at the State of the Union address could make Maduro view Guiado as more of a threat to his position of power. \n\nhttps://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2020-01-11/venezuelas-guaido-calls-for-more-protests-against-maduro\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2020/02/06/politics/trump-juan-guaido-white-house-meeting/index.html"], [84877, "2020-02-10T14:41:48Z", [0.15], ""], [80539, "2020-02-10T00:56:30Z", [0.0], ""], [9737, "2020-02-09T18:29:02Z", [0.49], ""], [82164, "2020-02-09T17:45:13Z", [0.3], ""], [19127, "2020-02-09T09:20:30Z", [0.33], ""], [75863, "2020-02-08T23:24:57Z", [0.25], "\"As it stands, the regime probably no longer sees him as enough of a threat to stomach the blowback that would come from throwing him in jail.\" https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/02/05/juan-guaido-may-have-united-congress-briefly-he-is-faltering-venezuela/"], [172, "2020-02-08T20:25:38Z", [0.1], ""], [79142, "2020-02-08T19:03:03Z", [0.33], ""], [54663, "2020-02-08T09:45:24Z", [0.35], ""], [75093, "2020-02-07T17:02:20Z", [0.75], "This won't end short of civil war or international intervention.
