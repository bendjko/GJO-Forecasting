Since March 16, 2020, as of today, that level has continued.  On Friday, September 4, 2020, the Chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, gave an interview to NPR <https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=909590044&live=1&gt; in which he forecasted that because inflation rates has continuously undershoted its target rate, and because it is expected that a return to pre-COVID employment levels could take more than a year, interest rates will have to continue to be low to support economic activity for an extended period of time.  Additionally, Powell, before that interview, indicated that the US Fed was willing to tolerate an inflation rate above its 2% rate <https://www.forbes.com/sites/advisor/2020/08/27/fed-changes-inflation-stance-powell/#49f4d1d24686&gt;, which because of the inverse relationship between inflation and the US interest rate set by the US Federal Funds Rate, as a result of the system of fractional reserves <https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/12/inflation-interest-rate-relationship.asp#:~:text=There%20is%20a%20general%20tendency,to%20have%20an%20inverse%20relationship.&text=In%20general%2C%20when%20interest%20rates,economy%20slows%20and%20inflation%20decreases.&gt; supports the notion that no increase in the upper-limit of the US Federal Funds rate range is on the horizon.
