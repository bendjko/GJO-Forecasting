This first data point, or consideration, that I used was that statistically mass killing are rare- on average barely over 1% of countries see a new mass killing in any given year. This informs me that there is a 90% + given chance that any given country would not experience a new mass killing. Therefore, there is a greater probability that a Afghanistan will not. So, I put my first assumption as a 2% chance of YES\nFor my second consideration, I evaluate that the EWP assessed Afghanistan as the 2nd at most risk country out of a mass killing with a roughly 1 in 4 chance (24.1%). Using this I increase my likelihood to approximately 14% with the previous information. For my third consideration, I look at historical data from 2017. In 2017, civilian deaths resulting from aerial operations from government and international forces increased by 50%. Since military forces or police can be included in the category for an \u201carmed group\u201d and that political and international conflict can predicate an increase militia and insurgent activity, I adjust this information an increase from 14% to 19%. \nFinally, researching recent news articles, US military forces have been killed within the week, and peace talks between the U.S. and the Taliban have come to a halt. A top U.S. general warns that there can be an increase in violence as the elections near. This increases my total percent from 19% to 22%.

Key factors in gauging the likelihood of a campaign killing more than a thousand civilians hedge on a number of factors:   \u2022\tThe possibility of a cease-fire deal between the Taliban and the Afghan National Government \n\u2022\tThe length of time before a cease-fire deal between the Taliban and the Afghan National Government \no\t(The Taliban have already demonstrated a reliance on wide-spread violence to secure a better-negotiating position prior to a deal) \n\u2022\tThe possibility of a government collapse (with or without a ceasefire) \n\u2022\tThe possibility of major splinter in the Taliban in Afghanistan\n\u2022\tThe emergence of another major militant group/or resurgence of ISIL in Afghanistan  Based on current trends of violence in Afghanistan (August 2019) an average of 74 people were killed every day (with one fifth being civilians) - holding all things equal, we would anticipate another 27,010 deaths over the next calendar year, with at least 5,402 of those being civilians. \u2022\tWhile it\u2019s difficult to determine whether those killed in August 2019 died in attacks that qualify as part of a \u2018systemic campaign against civilians\u2019 there are some signs that many of the attacks that have the highest rates of civilian fatalities are the result of deliberate targeting. \n\u2022\tThe upcoming election later this month (September 2019) will also likely feature a Taliban lead effort to deliberately target civilians (In 2018, the Taliban claimed it conducted attacks on 318 polling locations) this trend, should a lasting ceasefire fail to manifest seems likely to continue into future years. --- \nupdated based on the collapse of talks with Taliban and Afghan/US government efforts to target the Taliban and Taliban defections to ISIL.
