Then you factor in the fact that Biden and Putin are in the works of setting up a meeting this summer, given that both seem to be okay with the meeting taking place. Thus, there is a reasonable probability that Putin rides a wave of diplomatic meetings this summer and perhaps by August 1, 2021 - the closing date for this question. However, it is not clear I suppose that Putin has agreed to the meeting with Ukraine as quick as he agreed to the US meeting. If Zelensky maintains that Russia is a potential invador, perhaps the prospects of a meeting will die off and the Russians be put off by that rhetoric. So I guess these are some reasons to doubt that it would occur. HOWEVER, a virtual meeting is usually something to consider. And considering the fact that a four-way talk is on the table, and the previous meeting between the two happened in Paris and involved other countries, I do think there is a possibility it occurs outside of the two countries and the more likely option over bin 1 given the tension between Russia and Ukraine. Having one or the other in the other person's country just seems like a power struggle. But then again Trump stepped foot in North Korea.

France's Europe Minister Cl\u00e9ment Beaune stated that support is not the same as membership. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the bloc\u2019s Foreign Ministers found the Russian build-up \u2018very concerning\u2019 but new sanctions were not envisioned against Moscow.\nSo, little support from them. An interesting perspective on Moscow\u2019s eventual aims is made by Dr. Fabian Burkhardt. (Dr Fabian Burkhardt is a Research Fellow at the Leibniz Institute for East and Southeast European Studies in Regensburg. Before, he was an Associate in SWP's Eastern Europe and Eurasia division). Russia has issued 200,000 Russian Passports to Ukrainians from the \u201cPeople\u2019s Republics\u201d of Donetsk and Luhansk that increases the difficulty of resolving territorial conflicts in the ex-Soviet Union by creating controlled instability that exerts pressure on Kiev. Burkhardt suggest this part of a greater plan to halt the decline of the Russian population. \u2018By delaying any resolution to the conflict, Russia achieves two objectives simultaneously: it retains permanent influence on Ukraine via the Donbas, and it becomes more attractive to many Ukrainians as a destination for emigration\u2019.\nBurkhardt goes on to say that Russia\u2019s aim is to torpedo any resolution of the conflict that by issuing Russian passports, pressure is exerted on the Ukraine by undermining its sovereignty without military annexation. This method known as mass extraterritorial naturalisation has been used in secession territories in Abkhazia, South Ossetia (both Georgia) and Transnistria (Republic of Moldova). Russia\u2019s military build-up on the Ukrainian Border, being ostentatious and overt,  was possibly a signal from Putin that Moscow has red lines that will be written by them and not the West. Putin at his annual address to the Russian Parliament warned the US and NATO not to cross the red line on threat of  \u201c a swift, asymmetric and harsh response\u2019 Therefore, in response to the question I will  suggest that Putin has nothing to gain from a meeting with Zelensky to discuss conflict in the Donbas, certainly holds the upper hand and is playing a long game. https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/20/europe/ukraine-zelensky-putin-meeting-intl/index.html  https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/04/22/putin-offers-to-meet-ukraine-president-in-moscow-any-time-a73711\nhttps://www.france24.com/en/europe/20210416-russia-tensions-on-menu-as-macron-holds-talks-with-ukraine-s-zelensky\nhttps://www.dw.com/en/ukraines-zelenskiy-invites-putin-to-meet-in-war-torn-donbass/a-57271488\nhttps://www.dw.com/en/ukraines-zelenskyy-hopeful-about-meeting-vladimir-putin/a-57339191\nhttps://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-zelenskiy-putin-meet-me-peace-talks-donbass-conflict-zone-2021-04-20/\nhttps://www.politico.eu/article/ukrainian-president-invites-putin-for-talks-in-conflict-zone/\nhttps://carnegie.ru/commentary/84250\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-56746144\nhttp://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/65428  https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/04/22/putin-offers-to-meet-ukraine-president-in-moscow-any-time-a73711  https://tass.com/world/1283267  https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-polytics/3233477-putin-ready-to-meet-with-zelensky-in-moscow.html  https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/kravchuk-zelensky-will-never-go-to-moscow-for-peace-talks.html  https://thehill.com/opinion/international/550036-putin-draws-a-red-line-on-ukraine-and-he-means-it  https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-putin-five-takeaways-state-of-nation-speech/31215781.html  https://www.swp-berlin.org/10.18449/2020C41/  https://carnegie.ru/commentary/84089\n"], [1333, "2021-05-01T09:20:53Z", [0.12, 0.12, 0.76], "To be honest I doubt he will make any progress on ending the war as yesterday\u2019s news underscored that the Kremlin is simply not interested as the conflict guarantees Ukraine can never join NATO, which can\u2019t accept new members with an active border dispute according to its charter.
