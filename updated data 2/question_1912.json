Several factors contributed to overestimation. I think the main one is that in mass media (both, in Russia and the West) Putin is portrayed is almost almighty macho leader who orders something and it happens. He can order the launch right on the Victory Day. Or right before meeting with Biden to show who's the boss. The reality is more nuanced. Russia has limited resources and the military, after modernization in recent years, is not the main priority - domestic stability is. Putin does not want to start arms race that Russia cannot win - more powerful Soviet Union ended up in a history dustbin because of that.  Sarmat, which will supposedly change the balance of power, cannot be pushed to the fore by all means necessary. Besides,  its capabilities, especially hypersonic ones, may have been overhyped.  Other factors contributed too. It was a Ukrainian rocket design bureau, with relevant expertise, that was given the project at the beginning. After 2014 (with Crimea annexed by Russia and military conflict in Donbass) it could not continue and the project was transferred to a Russian rocket design bureau that did not have experience in designing such big rockets. Hence all delays and difficulties. At the beginning of this year, it was reported that Russians started building a new testing range from scratch in taiga near Krasnoyarsk, devoted specifically to testing of Sarmat. This testing range was supposed to be finished at the end of 2021 and unusually difficulties of a construction of the range were reported - most probably, to justify delays of the launch. Not sure it was discussed here at GJOP. Yes, I was swayed myself by pronouncements that Sarmat was going to be launched \"very, very soon\" by powerful people. And I believe it may happen - later this quarter or somewhere at the end of the year or beginning of the next. Or not - technical difficulties may have been too high.   Regardless, it was an interesting exercise."], [34959, "2021-07-27T14:04:23Z", [0.0], ""], [87897, "2021-07-27T13:43:15Z", [0.0], ""], [28899, "2021-07-27T08:42:19Z", [0.0], ""], [88452, "2021-07-27T07:44:43Z", [0.0], ""], [94872, "2021-07-27T03:04:12Z", [0.01], ""], [84880, "2021-07-26T22:18:21Z", [0.0], ""], [81456, "2021-07-26T22:07:51Z", [0.02], ""], [691, "2021-07-26T19:02:53Z", [0.0], ""], [87897, "2021-07-26T14:42:20Z", [0.02], ""], [101394, "2021-07-26T06:55:39Z", [0.0], ""], [34959, "2021-07-26T02:26:59Z", [0.03], ""], [87897, "2021-07-26T01:03:11Z", [0.03], ""], [97892, "2021-07-26T00:53:51Z", [0.01], ""], [484, "2021-07-25T23:03:04Z", [0.0], "Down 10% for passage of time.

As for the argument regarding Russia's friendly reputation following the summit, here are my thoughts: https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1296950 I'm starting to think their first test may very well be the full-range test. If they expect to launch 3 in 2021, with the first being in the third quarter (around election time), then that means on average 1.5\u20132.0 months between each test. By stating that the first and perhaps most difficult will be in the third quarter (period of 3 months), that sure is a heck of a lot of time, unless they also plan to do another or all tests in the third quarter as well. But to me, that signals that whatever they want to test in the third quarter in that first one, it may require time to process so the other tests can go forth in the remaining time of 2021. Russia is reportedly also working on a nuclear test\u2014which is weird because if North Korea is also planning one, how strange for two nukes to be detonated within the same relative time. I would bet on the Russian one more likely to occur. But I digress. HOWEVER, August 1 is the closing date. That is still a far ways from election time, which would disprove my previous theory.

Wasn't the same planned in 2019? But of course, the more time passes, the more probability is that it would happen.

Still, his word is on the line. 3rd quarter is July-September, which includes August 1 - just one month before, two after.
