So, in effect, the question will be determined using data through March 31 instead of April 3. As cases still seem to be growing, it seems likely that the (true) 7-day average of hospital admissions will still be growing as of March 31. However, as growth in hospital admissions seems to be slowing, it looks unlikely to me that a 7-day average of 2500 will be reached in the remainder of the forecast period. As of right now, the UKHSA provides data through March 21, for which the (true) 7-day average is 2053.7. 10 days of data remain in the forecast period. In the past 10 days, the 7-day average grew by ~476. It would need to grow by 446.3 to reach 2500. If the growth in hospital admissions continues at nearly the same rate as in the past 10 days, 2500 would be reached. However, case growth seems to be slowing, so it seems unlikely that hospital admissions will grow at the same rate in the next 10 days as they did in the past 10 days.

But unfortunately, even though an enormous fraction of the UK population just had Omicron, a new, enormous fraction is now getting BA.2 (which really deserves its own letter, and frankly should have been named \"Pi\" on March 14). The BA.2 wave is sweeping through the UK more slowly than did Omicron, perhaps because of existing immunity and warming weather. ZOE Covid data supposedly suggest that UK cases are at an all-time high, while UKHSA data suggest that cases are nearing a peak in the UK that is far below, perhaps ~60% below, the Omicron peak. The growth in hospital admissions has started to slow, which also suggests that cases are somewhere near a peak. So it looks to me like both cases and hospitalizations may be nearing their peaks, and it looks most likely to me that the peak of the BA.2 hospital admissions wave may end up below that of the Omicron wave.

I think two factors will help determine this; the first is that prior infections were far higher leading up to Omicron compared to Delta - perhaps 17M total cases in the preceding 5 months (5.7M recorded), compared to 5M (1.7M recorded) in the same period before Delta - so the susceptible proportion of the population is substantially reduced this time. \nThe second is the 53%+ third dose coverage, which significantly restores immunity, and slightly reduces transmissibility. From the data supplied by @belikewater below, it looks like transmission may take 6-8 weeks to spread through children and young adults into older age groups. After 6-8 wks in the Delta wave there was a roughly 15% net increase increase in hospitalisation/case, perhaps related to this effect. Omicron will be moving into more highly vaccinated populations (the third dose uptake increases roughly 10% per decade in age), and this could result in a lower increase in daily hospitalisation this time round.

I was most likely quite wrong on much of this forecast. I'm not completely convinced that Omicron hospital admissions have peaked, though. They may well have. But I think Omicron is still likely to infect a lot more people age 50+, who are still more likely to be hospitalized, even with boosters. People age 50+ make up only ~25% of current daily cases, whereas a year ago, that figure was ~35%. A greater proportion of cases (up to ~28%) were in older people through about the end of 2021, about when cases peaked in the UK, but this proportion has rapidly tapered off since. A comparison with Delta may be useful. At the first Delta peak in July, <15% of cases were in people age 50+. At a later peak around October 17, cases age 50+ represented ~22% of cases and grew from there to ~27% of cases in early Nov. In the period between the July Delta peak and the Oct 17 peak, the percentage of cases in people age 50+ grew, declined, and grew again before peaking in early Nov. Hospital admissions for the whole period peaked Oct 29. It's possible that Omicron could cause one or more mini-waves like this, or there could just be a long tail of cases that gradually reaches older segments of society but never causes daily hospital admissions to rise above current levels. I do think looking at the age structure of current infections is key to understanding hospitalizations, though. Another factor is that the proportion of cases in children is rising in the new year, as expected. Because Omicron is causing more severe disease in children, this will be expected to result in more hospitalizations as well. In the week ending Jan 11, there were 873 pediatric admissions, and this number has been growing steadily since the end of Nov., particularly lately among school-age children. Daily and weekly hospital admissions in the working-age population (18-64) have started to decline, but are very slightly still growing for people age 65-84 and 85+. 53% of hospital admissions for the week ending Jan 11 were in people age 65+.

If you do that you get the following: ~59k peak in cases (7 day average) in early January 2021, with a peak of ~4,200 hospital admissions shortly after. ~7.1% of peak cases turned into peak hospital admissions.\n~48k peak in cases in July with a peak of ~900 hospital admissions. ~1.9% of peak cases turned into peak hospital admissions. Cases and hospital admissions have fluctuated around the latter levels since July. But the latter provides more useful numbers, since testing has massively expanded since January 2021 in the UK [1]. It's useful to look at test positivity for this as well [2]. For the January peak they were doing around 500k tests per day, from March on they've fluctuated around 900k tests per day, not dropping below 650k. Positivity was 13% at the January peak and only just now reached above 5%. So even though cases look comparable between January and July they're not, a lot of cases were likely missed in the January wave. So based on that I'm going to estimate the peak in cases and apply around 1.5 to 1.75% to estimate hospital admissions. That's lower than the summer percentage, but I think that's justified based on evidence from other regions that hospitalizations are lower (due to a potentially less severe virus and due to increased immunity due to people being fully vaccinated) [3]. There are signs that Omicron may be peaking in London [4], and South Africa peaked as well. So I would guess cases will peak in the UK sooner rather than later. Christmas is messing everything up as far as case reporting, but I'll guess a peak of around 130k to 175k cases. That would put my lower bound estimate at 120k*1.5% = 1,800 hospital admissions and my upper bound at just above 3,000. I'm widening the tails because this is a rough estimate, but I'm centering around that and leaning toward the lower end of my range a bit.

I don't think London cases have peaked, either. I can picture hospital admissions for London alone reaching a 7-day average of maybe 600/day in the near future. And UK cases are at 90k/day and rising as of Dec 16. It's hard to picture how that won't translate into a minimum of 386 admissions/24k * 100k/day = 1600 admissions/day, especially as cases gradually work through older segments of the population.

A peak case range of 175,000-250,000 is certainly possible before restrictions kick in or Omicron falls as in South Africa. The rate of hospitalisation has fallen from a 10-12% peak a year ago before vaccines to 1.6% now and was running at 2-2.3% pre booster jabs. This data (125k @1.5%=1.9K 175k@1.5% hospitalisation=2.6k,  225k@2.25%=>5k, compared to a short lived peak of a little over 4,000 this time last year.

The risk of hospitalization is being estimated, based on low numbers available to date, as roughly 25-70% lower than what was seen with Delta. I'll go with ~50% overall, as immunity acquired by previous infections and vaccinations is waning as I write. That would mean we can expect ~1% of cases to be hospitalized - if cases are tested at similar rates as before, which may not hold up as cases explode. So, to be on the safe side, I think it would be good to consider hospitalizations in the range of 0.7-2.0% of cases. It could be very difficult to know what's going on with cases very well until around late in the first week of January, because of the holidays, although the UK does do a very good job maintaining the continuity of testing and reporting. UK cases here: https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/cases A comparison with last year is also useful. At last year's peak, there were ~4k hospitalizations/day; the peak 7 day average was 4,235. That was before vaccines and before much of the population had any immunity. Omicron may be more severe than the ancestral strain that was circulating then, though. Will cases rise so fast that hospitalizations increase so quickly that 4.0k is exceeded? I don't rule it out. A lot depends on whether England implements restrictions, as the rest of the UK has already. Also, when restrictions are lifted at some point, what then? Omicron is extremely contagious. The 7 day average was at 940.1 on Dec 17, and at least some further rise is already baked in. I can't imagine the peak 7 day average being below 1500, especially as Omicron makes its way through older segments of the population; cases have not peaked yet. London alone may well see 800 admissions/day very soon, especially if restrictions are not imposed. But I also can't very easily picture it getting extremely high, as UK governments will likely intervene to prevent as many hospitalizations as last winter. I will cast my net far and wide in between at this point, though.  Let's suppose that the 7 day average of cases peaks at ~120k/day thanks to restrictions; this may well be too low. 0.007*120k = 840; we've already passed that. 0.02*120k = 2400. If cases peak at ~150k, a reasonable upper bound is 0.02 * 150k = 3k. I suspect that a peak of 7 day hospital admissions isn't likely to exceed 3k... unless Rho comes along.... Later edit: New meds that prevent Covid progression to hospitalization in some fraction of cases are becoming available. I don't think medicines that can be used at home will have a huge effect on the outcome of this forecast, but they will certainly have some. Pfizer's drug won't be widely available for some time, and molnupiravir is still in the trial phase in the UK.

There are reports of 50-70% fewer hospitalizations per case than previous variants (https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-59769969).  So perhaps 1 in 100 to 1 in 200 cases will be hospitalized.\n - the hospitalizations peak is also likely to be more spread out than the cases peak.  Perhaps another factor of 2 reduction in the hospital admissions peak?\n - unknown whether the base load of Delta (~900 admissions / day) will continue or drop, but I can't imagine it being competed out as fast as Omicron rises.\n - I haven't really considered beyond January.  Time for further mutations or developments to occur. In summary there are a lot of unknowns at this stage.
