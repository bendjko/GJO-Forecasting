On the 24th of March, it launched in the UK, Ireland, Austria, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland. (Launch was delayed in France until April 7th) The launch in Europe probably followed a similar pattern to the US, especially due to the free 7-day trial. This means that the first week accounted for a much higher proportion of subscribers than the following weeks. Day one = 10 million\nWeek 6 = 26.5 million\nWeek 18 = European Launch\nWeek 19? = END OF Q2 FISCAL PERIOD\nWeek 20 = 50 million subscribers Between day 2 and week 6 there was an average increase of 0.402 million per day, 2.8 million per week. Assuming the growth in subscriber count diminished by around 40% per week and leveled off at 0.2 million, by week 18 there would be 5.27 million new subscribers, 31.77 million subscribers in total. +/- 3 million as 40% could be completely wrong. The European launch would have been a huge success due to the COVID-19 health crisis. There were 5 million Disney+ app downloads in the UK on the first day alone according to measurement and analytics firm \u2018App Annie\u2019. App downloads do not directly correlate with subscriber count (multiple accounts, TV and laptop viewers, etc ), but it does represent how big the launch was. By my guesstimations, Disney+ had between 28.77 and 34.77 million subscribers by week 18. Officially, they had 50 million by week 20. We know that roughly 8 million of these subscribers come from India[2]. It launched there on the 2nd of April, which is after Q2. The French launch also happened in April, one day before the 50 million subscriber\u2019s announcement. Due to COVID-19 and the 7-day free trial, The European launch would have been very successful. I estimate between 6 and 9 million new subscribers in the first week. Furthermore, Trump ordered Americans to stay at home in late March. This would have increased the number of US subscribers per week. I estimate another 1 million subscribers in the last 2 weeks of March. 31.77 + 7.5 + 1 =  40.27 million. (between 35.77 and 44.77) However, it cannot be higher than \"around\" 42 million. India's launch was after March and accounted for \"around\" 8 million of the 50 million  Disney+ subscribers.

According to Statista.com, there are approximately 18,414,550 families in the United States (as of 2019) that have at least one child under the age of 11 [2]. Further, the Deadline article states that \"more than four in 10 (41%) of 18- to 24-year-olds say they already have access to the service\" [1]. According to Marketingcharts.com, there are appx 30.5M individuals in this age group [3]. Additionally, Nielsen reports that TV usage spiked 60% during previous crisis' and there was an increase of 104% in TV watching by teenagers in Seattle [4]. Another factor to take into consideration is that Universal Pictures announced this week that they will release current theatrical releases to households via a \"Video on Demand\" package [5]. There have also been rumors that Disney might follow suit by releasing Black Widow on Disney+ [6]. To note, that source is from 4Chan, so I judge it to be highly unreliable, however, I am including it here because of Universal's actions. It is currently impacting my assessment by less than 1%. I will continue to monitor this prediction as I assess it will change again. Please point out/correct any incorrect statements/analysis/assessments I have made.
