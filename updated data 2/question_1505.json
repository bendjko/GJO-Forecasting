As of today, there are still only 7 states that have confirmed cases of the Wuhan coronavirus as stated by the CDC. Because of that, there is now a 0% chance that the number of states is less than 5. The following statistics published by the CDC are influencing my prediction. As of today, there are still only 15 confirmed cases across these 7 states, but there are 52 pending cases that could potentially increase the number of states with a confirmed case if those pending are confirmed positive. There are 8 fewer pending cases from last week, and those 8 were confirmed negative over the course of the week. The chances of the rest that are pending to be negative is significantly more likely considering there are now 412 negative cases. The number of states and territories that have people under investigation is 42 and the total number of people who have been under investigation is 479. With these numbers I arrived at the following conclusion: the probability of positive cases is 0.031 (3.1%), which is down 0.01% from last week and the probability of negative cases is 0.86 (86.0%), which is up 3% from last week. That means that the probability of the 52 pending cases being positive and reaching to more than 11 states (5 more states than now) over the next couple of days is probable but significantly low. Since the probability is so low, I am saying that the number of states with positive cases is most likely to stay in the range it is now, unless the odds change and those pending end up positive then the number of states could jump up to the next range grouping (12-18). However, the extreme measures that the United States would take if over a quarter of its states were affected would make it very unlikely that the epidemic would get out of hand and affect more than 19 states.\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html"], [75794, "2020-02-25T23:30:58Z", [0.0, 0.95, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [85401, "2020-02-25T23:15:45Z", [0.0, 0.95, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [82389, "2020-02-25T22:58:33Z", [0.8, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [10794, "2020-02-25T22:32:16Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [14847, "2020-02-25T22:21:53Z", [0.0, 0.92, 0.08, 0.0, 0.0], "What if the CDC took down their USA map because of [_exaggerated_speculative_reason_]?"], [63595, "2020-02-25T22:13:54Z", [0.0, 0.85, 0.1, 0.04, 0.01], ""], [81500, "2020-02-25T22:05:43Z", [0.0, 0.98, 0.02, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [41612, "2020-02-25T21:57:15Z", [0.0, 0.97, 0.03, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [57778, "2020-02-25T21:52:30Z", [0.0, 0.98, 0.02, 0.0, 0.0], "https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/coronavirus-u-s-map-where-virus-has-been-confirmed-across-n1124546"], [85688, "2020-02-25T21:35:41Z", [0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [85688, "2020-02-25T21:30:36Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "Already done"], [14847, "2020-02-25T21:28:02Z", [0.0, 0.92, 0.08, 0.0, 0.0], "Anyone have a link to the CDC page that tracks which states?

As of today, the CDC has released that 7 states that have confirmed cases of the Wuhan coronavirus. Because of that, there is now a 0% chance that the number of states is less than 5. The following statistics published by the CDC are influencing my prediction. As of now, there are 15 confirmed cases across these 7 states, but there are 60 pending cases that could significantly increase the number of states with a confirmed case if those numbers are confirmed positive. The chances of those pending to be negative is significantly more likely considering there are 392 negative cases. The number of states and territories who have people under investigation is 42 and the total number of people who have been under investigation is 467. With these numbers I arrived at the following conclusion: the probability of positive cases is 0.032 (3.2%) and the probability of negative cases is 0.839 (83.9%). That means that the probability of the 60 cases being positive and reaching to more than 11 states (5 more states than now) over the next two weeks is probable but significantly low. Since the probability is so low, I am saying that the number of states with positive cases is likely to stay in the range it is now, unless the odds change and those pending end up positive then the number of states could jump up to the next range grouping (12-18). However, the extreme measures that the United States would take if over a quarter of its states were affected would make it very unlikely that the epidemic would get out of hand and affect more than 19 states. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html"], [38094, "2020-02-18T00:05:22Z", [0.0, 0.95, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0], "Proceedures appear to have a postive impact on containment.

But first let me explain how I compute this. There are two factors to consider: (1) How many cases there will be by 28th of February, (2) What will be the distribution between different states. (1) How many cases there will be by 28th of February? For that we have to estimate how quickly this will spread. If this is fully contained, there will be only a few more scattered cases, maybe 5 more in a very optimistic scenario. If this is not contained then we could expect the number of cases to double every week or so (owing to the incubation period and the infamous R0 parameter which we have now all heard about). In this latter case the expectation would be about 80 new cases by the end of February. The distribution is log-normal, owing to the exponential nature of the propagation of a new virus at the beginning. The problem is which is the mean and which is the variance: 1.a) I will assume that a 1 sigma variation corresponds to a doubling/halfing of the number of cases. That is, if the expected number of cases is N, then there is a 68% probability of having N/2 to 2N cases and a 98% probability of N/4 to 4N cases. 1.b) There will be an optimistic scenario in which we would expect the probability to peak at 10 new cases from now till 28th of February. 1.c) There will be a pessimistic scenario in which we would expect the probability to peak at 20 new cases from now till 28th of February. 2) What is the distribution of cases among states? Here I will use two models: 2.a) In model a we assume that if there is a new cases, the probability of appearing in state X is equal to the percentage of the population living in this state (respective to the 50+1 states considered in the question). 2.b) In model  b we assume that new cases cluster over old cases: the probability of appearing in state X is equal to the percentage of population living in this state times the current number of cases in said state plus one. Model a could roughly correspond to the virus coming from outside, while model b could correspond to having small outbreaks clustered around previous cases. By the way, model a when feed with the 11 cases we already have, gives a 98% probability for the between 5 and 11 bucket, which gives me confidence in the fact that this model might have some merits to it. Now, let's crunch the numbers and fill the buckets (with the initial condition that there already are 11 cases in 5 different states): a+a) Optimistic + model a gives 0, 51, 39, 10, 0 \na+b) Optimistic + model b gives 0, 89, 11, 0, 0 b+a) Pessimistic + model a gives 0, 17, 45, 37, 0\nb+b) Pessimistic + model b gives 0, 66, 33, 1, 0 Now we have to average these probabilities. For that I do as follows: Optimistic: 2/3 of model a probabilities + 1/3 of model b probabilities (imported cases expected to be more important than home-grown cases):  0, 64, 30, 6, 0 Pessimistic: 1/3 of model a probabilities + 2/3 of model b probabilities (imported cases expected to be less important than home-grown cases):  0, 50, 37, 13, 0 As we can see, the probabilities now look similar in both cases. By averaging the two scenarios we arrive at 0, 57, 34, 9, 0 (my current answer).

Positive rate fell more than half and we expect it may fall further until it reaches a plateau. Most negatives come because of the scare \u2013 better overdo  screening than not. Next. Not all states are created equal. \n4 states are already on the list \u2013 California, Illinois, Arizona and Washington \u2013 have 48% of the Chinese immigrants of the whole USA (based on Census 2010 and Wikipedia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Americans). I use relative numbers of the Chinese as a proxy for probability estimates to end up on the final list - the more Chinese in the state, the higher probability of travelers coming from China to the state. Of course, business and tourism travel of all other people can be significant factor as well. The probabilities of the  latter roughly correlate with overall populations in the state. We can use numbers of American Chinese for that too for simplicity as we do not know exact contributions for these factors.  Back to our model. Add to the 4 already on the list another state (especially if we add NY) and the first bucket is quite possible as new cases will have more than 50% probability to stay in the 1st bucket (with NY \u2013 65%).  The 2nd bucket. If it is comprised of the 8 other states with largest Chinese American populations, it would have 36% for new cases to end up there. Of course, this is not random selection and if by chance NY is not in this bucket, probability is even lower. The other buckets will be filled even with lower probabilities.  Of course, the number of states is cumulative and with endless time all states can be hit. But time is not endless \u2013 the time frame is just one month. Too little information to add cumulative effect. The new cases have more than 50% stay in the 1st bucket, but can be spilled into the 2nd (and 3rd, but the time is too short).
