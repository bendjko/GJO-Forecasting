(1) If either/or (a), (b), (c) and (d) would be modified (change of law or application of the law (*)) the same mechanism might then apply to a different set of facts. Yet this might still be the (%/%/%) number. This is at least a non-0 % chance, so (+1/+1/+1) at least.\nIf nothing where changed, the question would then be about what factors one considers to be relevant to yielding the same upper limit of the target range, almost year over year. baserate Between December 2008 and December 2015 the target rate remained at 0.00\u20130.25%, as reaction to the 2007/2008 financial crisis. (1)  factors This suffices for me for now in establishing the equation: (sum of factors leading to perception of financial crisis) -> unchanged low target rate.\nYet, many factors may come into play and I see no way to accurately assess all probabilities - for now, so (+3/+3/+3). Examples: \nLong-term processes:\n- After the gold standard and the 1976 switch to fiat money, a change in humankinds monetary policy is imminent, given the trusted middle man bank is no longer necessary with blockchain. Just as trust would have to evolve from balance-sheet-numbers backed by 'gold in someone's vault' to be backed by 'numbers on somebody's paper', they now will evolve to be backed by 'numbers on somebodys servers'. Yet I doubt this will happen within the single year in question here.\n- US-China trade war.\n- Climate Change; Storm Season devastating continental US, thus devastating housing market - or giving rise to orchestrated re-building of US-Cities - this time with a third space.\nShort-term processes:\n- US presidential election.\n- San-Andreas-Quake. conclusio So if nothing of that sort happened - and I am basing my current estimate on that hypothesis, I deem 'same' most likely by far, as financial crisis 2007/2008 is precedent and I actively expect not many new solutions to come about, with the current US focus on BLM and Trump.

The two most likely scenarios I can think of that could cause the fed to increase the upper limit would be an unprecedentedly rapid increase in inflation (otherwise Such an increase would not be in any way accordance to their dual mandate), or some sort of mistake in the implementation and communication of the Feds intended policy. However, these strike me as sufficiently unlikely as to be justified in rounding down their probability to 0%, rather than rounding them up to 1%. Even though this question is asking about December to January change, I would even go so far as to apply this rounded 0% estimate to the scenario that the Fed would increase it's rate from any point between my answering this question the first time (Sep 19 2020) and December 27th. This latter more general estimate is important for my other calculations. Same vs lower:\nThe primary consideration for my 96% estimate is the base rate of decreasing either the upper limit (or for historical data decreasing the target rate) below 0-0.25%. A change in to negative interest rates would be unprecedented, and there is little reason for the fed to decrease its upper limit while keeping its lower limit the same. However, there are many factors that make it much more likely that the Fed would decrease the target range (and thus the upper limit). We are currently in a recession, the natural rate of interest is lower than in previous decades meaning unconventional policy is more necessary to provide policy space, and other countries have began to explore negative interest rates as legitimate tools of monetary policy albeit with varying degrees of success. Nonetheless, recent federal reserve minutes and release statements make it clear that all FOMC voting members are not big fans of enacting negative interest rates in the US, with perhaps the possible but unlikely exception of Kaplan based on the vague wording in the September press release statement. So I put the odds of the Fed decreasing the higher upper limit FFR between the stated dates at about 4%.
