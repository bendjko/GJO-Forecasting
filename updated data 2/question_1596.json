As many others have pointed out, daily confirmed cases are a simple function of (#_DAILY_TESTS x %_POSITIVE). I looked at a simple Monte Carlo with following values for those inputs: -Range of .75-1.75MM #_DAILY_TESTS // This seems conservative for the subject timeframe, vis-a-vis current projections on required testing for broad reopening. [1]\n-Range of 1.5-4 %_POSITIVE // This also feels conservative, given that the current trend appears to be starting to level around 5% positive, even as testing substantially increases. It seems reasonable that %_POSITIVE will stay closer to 5% than 0, to the extent that several studies have estimated that we have been under reporting ~90% of cases. [2] With these parameters, approximately 94% of seven-day totals are >= 200,000. I feel pretty solid in the foregoing logic, but adjust down by 15% for a whole host of reasons, among them the potential for: -Issues with scaling of testing (seems to be going pretty well so far)\n-Reopening going extremely well (fairly confident there will be hiccups)\n-Extreme pressure felt by Trump admin to minimize deaths/spread as election approaches (they\u2019ll feel the pressure, but we\u2019ll see what they can/will do about that)\n-I\u2019m a little scared to be so far off from the crowd on this one :-) If #_DAILY_TESTS continues to climb without hitting much resistance, and the decay on %_POSITIVE is minimal, I will continue to adjust upward toward the straight output of the Monte Carlo.

Additionally, Total Tests will no longer include faxes or aggregate counts received by various labs since there is not a timely way to complete data quality checks. \"\n"], [27661, "2020-09-15T16:02:35Z", [0.95], ""], [80660, "2020-09-15T15:41:46Z", [0.88], ""], [28153, "2020-09-15T13:33:10Z", [1.0], ""], [60948, "2020-09-15T07:57:01Z", [0.9], " Staying at 90%."], [88569, "2020-09-15T00:38:00Z", [0.96], ""], [88209, "2020-09-14T23:06:43Z", [0.4], ""], [15318, "2020-09-14T13:13:46Z", [0.9], ""], [88766, "2020-09-14T10:26:25Z", [0.81], ""], [27661, "2020-09-14T07:25:53Z", [0.9], ""], [95344, "2020-09-14T06:51:56Z", [0.87], ""], [92786, "2020-09-14T06:32:42Z", [0.98], ""], [13306, "2020-09-14T06:04:07Z", [0.95], ""], [88569, "2020-09-14T05:56:43Z", [1.0], ""], [38094, "2020-09-14T03:11:31Z", [0.98], "9/13 the US had 45,523 the previous day it had 37128.

As usual, I use a week-vs-week exponential model, from which I relate the number of new weekly cases as: Cases(day_n) - Cases(day_n - 7) = x * (Cases(day_n - 7) - Cases(day_n - 14)) right now we have somewhere between 300-330K cases per week (307K as of yesterday, but the latest number can always be a statistical fluke) and for x we have the following values: x (last 7 days) = 0.898 +/- 0.058\nx (last 14 days) = 0.910 +/- 0.052 \nx (last 21 days) = 0.902 +/- 0.047 which, despite the marked decreased of x in the last few 3 days or so, are remarkably consistent numbers. Now lets argue: 1) If we want to avoid having 200K cases on the first week of October, we need x < 0.937, which is within a 1 sigma error band of the numbers I have given above. Depending on where I do begin for number of weekly cases, I get a 22-33% probability that this question will be closed the 7th of October (if I reduced the variance owing to the fact that I have to combine exponentials, I will get 4-12% of closing during the first week). 2) But the previous assumes that x is going to be maintained at the current level for about 39 days (or 39+7 days), give or take. And here a problem arises. So far for the US the longest streak with x < 1.0 has been 32 days, and the current streak is already 25 days long. That is, we need 64 days of x < 1.0 (actually of x around 0.937, which is more stringent than the previous condition) to avoid hitting the 200K mark on the first week of October. If we assume that the probability of x < 1 is independent of what has happened in the past, there is at least a 50% probability (minimum) that this does not hold till the 1st of October. But it could be higher. 3) Combining 1 and 2, I will end with somewhere between 60 and 65% that the question ends in the first week of October, which does not look particularly good. However, the end date of the question is not the 7th of October, but 31st of December. How much this raises the probability? Well, I do not know, but probably significantly. There is also the longer view coming from Europe and other countries with a second wave: in a time frame of 3 to 6 months, the probabilities of getting more cases than during the first wave are significant (but I did not outside-view them, sorry. Anyone wanting to analyze second waves in terms of time frames and sizes, @pstamp @juancambeiro @Dillyweed @jainsa @Leonardthethird @tccoleman26 @A356 ?). 4) But as a matter of fact, there might be factors pushing the probability both up and down: 4.a) Up: the kids are back to school, people are back to work\n4.b) Down: the current wave has affected mostly young people trying to have fun. This ends in September. Besides, this time social distancing might finally be taken seriously. Frankly, I find the arguments for \"Up\" more convincing than for \"Down\". For the moment I will settle on 91%, and then I will try to outside-view the second waves in a series of countries to pin down the probabilities in the medium to long run."], [60948, "2020-08-23T11:35:54Z", [0.95], ""], [28899, "2020-08-23T11:27:23Z", [0.88], ""], [57778, "2020-08-23T09:46:02Z", [0.78], ""], [86664, "2020-08-22T22:27:23Z", [0.9], ""], [19127, "2020-08-22T21:03:22Z", [0.84], ""], [1333, "2020-08-22T20:28:34Z", [0.57], ""], [1333, "2020-08-22T18:53:26Z", [0.56], ""], [45594, "2020-08-22T13:58:18Z", [0.25], ""], [67403, "2020-08-22T11:52:41Z", [0.95], ""], [57778, "2020-08-22T10:26:54Z", [0.85], ""], [88098, "2020-08-21T23:58:24Z", [0.9], ""], [89379, "2020-08-21T22:32:38Z", [0.75], ""], [28153, "2020-08-21T21:15:25Z", [0.87], ""], [87897, "2020-08-21T15:35:23Z", [0.93], "I suspect this is very likely (93%):\n# seasonality may have somewhat slowed the spread of covid in the US during the summer months \n# there are still many pockets of largely unaffected communities ripe for outbreaks\n# many states seem to be happy to maintain a relatively large outbreak as long as it doesn't overwhelm their health systems\n# schools will likely increase transmission rates after a few weeks of in person sessions\n# rollbacks of reopenings are going to very difficult politically\n# some people who were initially infected at the beginning of the year could be vulnerable to reinfection\n# better testing picks up more cases the reasons I can think of that this might not happen (7%):\n# the broader population takes the threat seriously and shifts behavior interrupting transmission chains in an unexpected way\n# better methods of testing and contact tracing lead to more effective controls\n# maybe more people have already had the virus than originally anticipated AND time to when reinfection is possible is long enough to slow transmission"], [57778, "2020-08-21T10:52:36Z", [0.81], ""], [57778, "2020-08-21T05:03:32Z", [0.85], ""], [88569, "2020-08-21T04:48:04Z", [0.55], "Frustrating that so much of the apparent decline in new cases is actually due to the decline in testing.

No research I have read shows the reduction of infection from a healthy person wearing one. -\nMask use during COVID-19: A risk adjusted strategy*\n-\nWang, Pan, Tang, Ji and Shi (2020) June 25, stated that:\n-\nIn the past two decades, countries in East Asia have experienced infectious disease epidemics or air pollution episodes, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), avian influenza, influenza, and haze events. Hence, wearing masks has become a pervasive in society as a way to prevent exposure. This is for good reason, as the population density in Asian countries is generally higher than that in western countries, and the crowding in a confined place will increase the infection risk or exposure. Therefore, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the public is encouraged to wear masks in public places and people often comply as a form of health-seeking behavior (Greenhalgh et al., 2020) (Para. 7).\nHowever, in many western advanced economies, those wearing masks are often met with suspicion in public, even causing panic in certain situation. Universal mask use in the community has been discouraged by some health authorities with the argument that masks provide no effective protection against coronavirus infection (Feng et al., 2020). Although the 1918 Pandemic (H1N1 virus) caused an estimated 40\u201350 million deaths worldwide, many still may view personal protective equipment (PPE) and physical barrier including wearing the mask as contrary to freedom and individualism (World Health Organization, 2005). Furthermore, there are some cultural underpinning of the use of masks as well, as it was partially prohibited by the introduction of no mask act under the background of increasing political demonstration and terrorist attacks. Since the transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 has not been fully understood, thus wearing masks should indeed be a cautionary prevention course of action (Para. 8). 2.2. The effectiveness of the mask\nAs a basic non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) measure, wearing a mask is an effective means of preventing respiratory infectious diseases, which could reduce the risk of infection (World Health Organization Writing Group, 2006). In this study, mask is defined as a device covering the mouth and nose providing a barrier to minimize the direct transmission of infective agents according to relevant standards, including disposable medical mask, surgical mask, and respirator with or without valve, etc. (British Standards Institution, 2019; Standardization administration of China, 2016). In a large systematic review of physical interventions to control spread of infectious diseases, Jefferson et al. concluded from 67 studies that wearing masks is effective as one of the important barriers to transmission of respiratory viruses, and evidences indicate N95 respirators were non-inferior to surgical masks (Jefferson et al., 2011). Other studies also found evidence that wearing masks can significantly reduce the risk of SARS and influenza-related diseases (Jefferson et al., 2009; Macintyre et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2013). Aldila et al. constructed MERS determinant mathematical model and found that compared with auxiliary nursing and government publicity, wearing masks is the optimal choice for reducing the number of infections (Aldila et al., 2018). In addition, the costs of wearing masks is also the lowest for society, as it is a simple low-cost intervention (Aldila et al., 2018). During SARS epidemic, a survey conducted in the United States, Singapore, Chinese Taiwan, and Hong Kong showed that the meaning of wearing masks has exceeded their direct effects in disease prevention and has become a means of raising public awareness of other NPIs, such as isolation (Pillemer et al., 2015). Barasheed et al. systematically analyzed the utilization and effectiveness of masks by integrating 12,710 samples from more than 50 countries in the world, and found that wearing masks in crowded places could reduce the risk of respiratory infections by 20% (Barasheed et al., 2016). A study in Hong Kong found that the odds ratio (OR) value of wearing masks in public places was only 0.36, which was lower than that of living room disinfection (OR = 0.41) and frequent hand washing (OR = 0.58), indicating that wearing masks effectively restricted the community spread of SARS-CoV in Hong Kong (Lau et al., 2004) (Para 10).\n-\nReference\n-\nWang, J., Pan, L., Tang, S., Ji, J.

The standard deviation of this data is 69,000, indicating that there has been great range. However, on only 42% of days during this time frame was the sum of the previous seven days infection totals greater than 200,000. In the past seven days however, 421,759 infections were reported. Recently, this has been trending upwards, and totals in the near future are expected to increase/ Furthermore, the US gross testing rates today (and even more so from April 1 until now) have been very low. I mentioned this in another question, but I think its relevant here too: According to the NY Times, 34/50 states are below the standard testing threshold determined by the Harvard Global Health Institute. Nationwide, 690,000 tests are being conducted each day. The goal is ~2,000,000 daily tests. The US is currently testing only at ~35% of its target figure each day. Under-testing in the US not only accelerates the spread of the virus due to poor detection of cases, it will result in higher reported figures in later months when testing is ramped up. The country is currently reopening, and combined with increased testing, infection rates will increase. Although infection rates in populous states are currently extremely high, as testing increases, more infections will be reported. Furthermore, in the final three months of the year the weather gets colder, which will move people inside and further viral spread. Thanksgiving and the holiday season are heavy travel holidays, which can definitely spread the virus further.  A better way to frame this probability is to look at the odds of the US having fewer than 200,000 infections for all seven consecutive day time frames this fall. This would mean the US more than halving the current infection rates, even as school and universities reopen, the country reopens and testing becomes more prevalent. Because of all of this, I think there is an 80% chance of a having at least one seven day period with more than 200,000 reported infections this fall, which is roughly twice the base rate of 42% given from historic data since April 1st, though takes into account the great uncertainties around COVID-19 infection data."], [75863, "2020-07-14T17:13:27Z", [1.0], ""], [88766, "2020-07-14T10:12:26Z", [0.58], ""], [21884, "2020-07-14T01:53:36Z", [0.2], ""], [88497, "2020-07-14T00:23:20Z", [1.0], ""], [14027, "2020-07-13T23:00:15Z", [0.91], ""], [86513, "2020-07-13T19:26:54Z", [0.9], ""], [75863, "2020-07-13T19:10:06Z", [1.0], ""], [88010, "2020-07-13T18:21:46Z", [0.85], ""], [88569, "2020-07-13T16:29:34Z", [0.9], ""], [27661, "2020-07-13T14:07:46Z", [0.55], ""], [67609, "2020-07-13T13:54:57Z", [1.0], ""], [80764, "2020-07-13T11:57:03Z", [0.75], ""], [57778, "2020-07-13T08:26:57Z", [0.95], ""], [93532, "2020-07-13T03:06:17Z", [0.2], "There are signs virulent mortality has dropped as younger populations get infected.

Daily infections have been quickly climbing from 20k/day in early June to 62k now, implying 3^12 annual growth in daily infected. This recent rally has been driven by conservative states such as Louisiana, Texas, and Florida. Political resistance to limiting economic freedoms (ie forced closures) are antithetical to the Republican party's beliefs and are economically harmful. This makes lock-downs hard to support/implement. Further compounding this resistance is that Trump will be out for re-election in Nov 2020. Because of this, my prior is that new cases can and will continue to spike. I believe that governors will eventually shut down (I estimate in a month) as the virus forces business closure. Therefore, I believe that cases may spike to 190k. This is below the 200k asking so I will tilt towards < 50% probability for my prior. Note: I know the question is asking for 7 day averages, but they are close approximations for each other and simplifies analysis without (hopefully) losing too much accuracy. My prior is 40%.  The likelihood is difficult to calculate. On one hand, positive catalysts like a vaccine always hang overhead. On the other hand, very public resistance to the disease make it difficult for Republican party leadership to double back during an election year. In fact, with Trump looking down in the polls, they cannot afford any setbacks. Their constituents are likewise okay with lax measures so there is little pressure to close up. With this information, I would increase my odds of being over 200k to 45%. I still believe this is under 50% because a 7 day average of 200k+ indicates 1.4m newly infected in a week, which would add 50% of infected cases from existing high levels.

In fact the number of deaths is so low that it has almost dropped below the threshold for the CDC to categorize this as an epidemic. This week it was right at the threshold, 5.9% of total deaths. The reason that we have so many new cases now is because of the increased availability of testing. Because more tests are available they are testing people who are much less symptomatic than the people they used to test. Now everyone that comes into a hospital for whatever reason, even if it is for a car accident, is getting a test. But these tests really aren't testing the true immunity which is T cell immunity.

There really is no second wave going on. The dialogue has changed. It used to be about the number of deaths and when it became clear the fatality rate is barely two or three times the fatality rate of the flu, they had to change the focus. so now they are talking about the number of new cases but the reason the number of new cases is exploding is because of all of the new testing.  https://news.psu.edu/story/623797/2020/06/22/research/initial-covid-19-infection-rate-may-be-80-times-greater-originally the more information we get about the virus the less deadly and dangerous it becomes.

Antibodies drop off within a few months, and may never register for someone who is asymptomatic, but they can still be immune based on cellular memory.

Here's what my spreadsheet (using numbers from covidtracking.com) tells me: 10, 30, 90 daily average new tests: 545k / 490k / 327k\n10, 30, 90 daily positive:  34k / 26k / 26k\n10, 30, 90 daily avg share positive:  6.3% / 5.2% / 10.4%\n10, 30, 90 daily average  day over day test growth:  2.6% / 1.9% / 3.8% To me what's most interesting is share positive appears to be increasing even as tests are also increasing.  This is significant because I think tests will only continue to rise and I believe the true number of daily new cases is larger than what tests have previously captured.  Of course, there are multiple world's where we reach the 200k+ 7 day case count in specified time frame  We can imagine one world where share positive continues to drop, but tests increase substantially enough that we hit 200k (daily share positive 1%, daily tests 3M+).  We can also imagine a world where both tests and share positive increases and we hit 200k+.  We can also imagine a world where tests decrease due to a shortage but share positive increases so much that we hit 200k+ (30% share positive, 100k daily tests) .   Now, as far as I can tell, the lowest daily share positive was around 3.98% on Monday, June 1st 2020, which is 23,880 daily new cases if we assume 600k daily tests.  That's 4691 shy of daily necessary to hit 200k per week.  If we believe it's possible for tests to be at about 700,000 daily tests in October, then 3.98% of that is 27,860, which is 711 short of the daily necessary for 200k per week.  711 is a pretty small gap.  The last 30 days share positive has been 5.2%, which would be 36,400 daily new cases at assumption of 700k daily tests. OTHO, there are models out there that think it's possible for us to measurably reduce daily infections / daily case counts.  For example, UW's famous models predicts we could get daily infections, and thus daily new case count I would assume, down to 10k per day with universal mask wearing.  At the same time, the current model is projecting a most likely scenario of daily new infections to be around  60k per day at the start of October, with most likely scenario of \n900k daily tests.   Needless to say, my confidence in the projection back above 90%.   Note: I'm not a statistician or math nerd.  If I'm making basic stats mistakes or misreading the data someway please let me know so I can adjust and be better.  I'm sure there are mistakes here somewhere. OTHO, there could be a massive, devastating war or natural disaster that completely wipes out our ability to test, but this seems low probability at the moment. It seems to me the most likely scenario for me being wrong is one where I am greatly underestimating the power of small increases in herd immunity to have outsized effects on daily infections, even when well below supposed 40 - 60% of population having contracted covid.  That or some combo of it or of states all deciding to go back to stringent social distancing or universal mask wearing which seems unlikely in our increasingly polar (some might say totally absurd) country.

I looked at a simple Monte Carlo with following values for those inputs: -Range of .75-1.75MM #_DAILY_TESTS // This seems conservative for the subject timeframe, vis-a-vis current projections on required testing for broad reopening. [1]\n-Range of 1.5-4 %_POSITIVE // This also feels conservative, given that the current trend appears to be starting to level around 5% positive, even as testing substantially increases. It seems reasonable that %_POSITIVE will stay closer to 5% than 0, to the extent that several studies have estimated that we have been under reporting ~90% of cases. [2] With these parameters, approximately 94% of seven-day totals are >= 200,000.

I don't think so, it would require the dumb and unlucky repetition of the same mistakes in major cities around the country, all making the dumb and unlucky mistake at once. Again. Baselines: North Italy and Northeast France had have the very unfortunate superspreading events of a major European football match and a major Christian church gathering. People went home without knowledge of the infection. Handwashing wasn't an issue, masks were not introduced. Germany's clusters were all beer-drinking festivities around traditional or semi-traditional calendar dates. In Korea, the superspreading event was a gym full of jumpy people, where you don't wear masks, of course. By comparison, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore instantly recalled SARS 2003 and got their gears on. If we look at the kind of people that produced the spread, it's the sort of overly active, extroverted person under 35 who seems to be affluent enough to play hard. It's not the librarian. Although, reports about choirs and churches suggest otherwise. Think of Spring Breakers. USA: If you look at a mildly affected state, like New Hampshire 70km away from Logan Intl, the cluster is concentrated in the very county with an international airport (Manchester). Illinois, New Jersey, New York, Boston, LA California, had have the unlucky pleasure to receive US American travelers from Europe returning at the same time, because Donald Trump announced a ban on flights. These travelers landed virtually the same day in Chicago O'Hare, JFK, La Guardia, Logan International etc. Except for Logan, they are the busiest airports worldwide, always ranking on par with Heathrow, Tokyo and Madrid.  These affluent people got stuck for hours in the airport, spreading the virus even further by just waiting for entry to the USA. I still remember the March 18 photos on Twitter. No testing, no masks. The incredible 200,000/week was then about 14 days into the future. After showering in viruses at the airport, they might have gone to an African-American barbershop, to the gym, or community church, to get the virus going in the overly unprepared and unsuspecting African-American community of New York. Meanwhile, the really affluent fled Manhattan, after fetching the very limited number of tests available on the market, for enjoying safety in their beach houses. This is epidemiology with eye candy.

[2]  With these parameters, approximately 94% of seven-day totals are >= 200,000. I feel pretty solid in the foregoing logic, but adjust down by 15% for a whole host of reasons, among them the potential for: -Issues with scaling of testing (seems to be going pretty well so far)\n-Reopening going extremely well (fairly confident there will be hiccups)\n-Extreme pressure felt by Trump admin to minimize deaths/spread as election approaches (they\u2019ll feel the pressure, but we\u2019ll see what they can/will do about that)\n-I\u2019m a little scared to be so far off from the crowd on this one  :-) If #_DAILY_TESTS continues to climb without hitting much resistance, and the decay on %_POSITIVE is minimal, I will continue to adjust upward toward the straight output of the Monte Carlo.

Similar random testing of 863 individuals in Los Angeles yielded a seropositivity for antibodies rate of 4.65% implying over 365,000 adults (a far higher ratio than 10 times) had been infected compared to the reported confirmed 8430 infections by the date of testing (April 10th 2020). \nOn the other hand, Data based on county wise analysis of impact of various state wide social distancing measures shows the potential for affecting transmission ranging between 10 to 35 times. Since these measures are being relaxed, but people are using common sense to reduce exposure (masks, distancing, changes in schools, workplace, sports limitation), we will see a slower transmission and hopefully a lower viral load exposure causing immunity without the high mortality.\nFrom all above, expect that by October over 35% or 1/3 of the population will have been exposed (going from a 5 to 20% exposed now based only on adults without including children and ongoing slow transmission and  5 months till October) which would decrease the number we are trying to predict for Oct to Dec\nAlso currently the majority of deaths and symptomatic infection is in older adults and in certain settings such as nursing homes.

If we are prepared to do massive testing, tracing and isolation we could limit the spread to well under the levels of April.  Even if we only do half as well as Taiwan or New Zealand we could severely limit the spread of new cases. 2) If there is another outbreak in the fall will we be prepared to go into lockdown again.  I believe the answer to this is a definite NO.  And if we do sufficient testing and tracing we should not need to have another lockdown.  Will the authorities foresee the possibility a the second wave AND prepare for it?  Or will we again take the ostrich approach and just wish it away?  I do not believe we will make the same mistake twice, but there will of course be new mistakes to make. 3) Will there be a significantly more dangerous mutation by October/November, one that is more transmissible?

Right now, WHO lists only 776,907 Americans have contracted covid so far (or .24% US population, which is probably an underestimate by 1.25 - 2x but that's for another day).  That means about 9M Americans are still yet to contract the disease between now and EOY, which means we will easily see weeks in excess of 200k new cases.  Some might argue that my numbers are off by some order of magnitude, but 3% is a generous low end expectation of what many epidemiologist have forecasted.  Even if we assume only 2% of Americans contract the disease, the chances are still pretty decent that there will be weeks later in the 4th quarter where we see greater than 200k new infections, since most of those will be bunched up in the fall rather than spread evenly across the remainder of the year.   Some percent of Americans will contract Covid-19 in 2020.  The question is what percent.  After that it's just math.  All the other theorizing is not necessary.  But even if we add additional variables, 2-3% are quite likely estimates.  A vaccine is not likely to come until later in the year, and many states are already backing off of social distancing rules.

It appears very unlikely that with the current testing regime the current wave will lead to the >200k confirmed cases at the end of this year. Hence, as many have said, this depends on the likelihood of, and potential impact of, a second wave in the Winter. These factors depend on (among other things) the spread of the first wave and implication if reinfection can / cannot occur with the same (or a suitably similar) strain, the likelihood of mutation that could cause a new outbreak and potential severity of mutated strain (R, fatality rate, etc), impact of winter weather on the disease, number of (and methodology for) testing being conducted at the time, etc. There are lots to consider, making a sensible prediction difficult. Taking the current number of confirmed deaths (36k), an estimate of the IFR at ~0.5-1.0% and a mean time from infection to death of ~20 days, this yields approximately 3.6-7.2m infections in the US as of 20 days ago and playing that forward at the rate of increase in confirmed cases, ~16-32m infections today. A long tailed (slow decline in the number of infections) simulation would give ~50-100m infections total in this \"wave\" (or ~15-30% of the total population). If reinfection is assumed to not be on the cards, this would still be a large enough population for a major outbreak to occur again with the same strain of the virus (especially considering a heterogeneous population - there may be pockets where there is localised \"herd immunity\" such as NY and NJ but other areas with limited immunity). Hence a second wave (potentially exacerbated by weather) could potentially emerge under the same strain. Likelihood of mutation that  is something that I am not well versed on, though reading suggests that the virus is mutating slowly and most mutations are benign. Most important is whether mutations negate any natural (potential) antibody resistance preventing reinfection as this would effectively reset the clock and increase the likelihood of a similar second wave spike. Testing would seem unlikely to be a limiter in reaching the specified number of weekly cases as capacity has ramped up already (and could be switched back on if required) and the period is long enough to allow a repeated ramp up if required. All-in-all, definitely a possibility but too early to make anything more than an educated stab in the dark.

I\u00b4m convinced, that some kind of genetic resistancy plays a huge role here. It was about 80% of the world population with the spanish flu. Otherwise everbody would have died then without vaccines or treatment available. They got herd immunity anyway on a level, that it was over after 2 years (meaning 95% had been immune or resistant anyway by then).   Main Scenario expected: after a horrible first year Corona will be an aditional flu, staying with us for 1-20 years. Conclusion: we would need standard test for CoViD with EVERY case of expected flu, blood donation etc. to have the slightest chance of getting that number of cases in a week. Even if it came back seasonally like the flu, I\u00b4d be surprised, if this question was a \"yes\". Anyway that creepy little virus surprised all of us in a bad way so many times, that a significant number for \"yes\" is required."], [586, "2020-04-19T18:44:32Z", [0.85], "I tend to lean towards the opinion that SARS2 will mutate and strike with second wave by end of the year, similarly to Spanish, Asian or Hong Kong flues. \nCurrent social isolation will create a situation by the end of the year that we won't reach herd immunity in a natural way (not that we should) and vaccine won't we delivered yet. This will favour more aggresive virus mutation."], [40584, "2020-04-19T18:22:34Z", [0.65], "Does anyone have thoughts on how to model / predict the possibility of a mutation? My impression from reading papers is that the models everyone talks about seem to generally not attempt to model the possibility of major mutations. Instead they treat mutation from a scenario planning approach and mostly ignore it from what I can see. Here's a rough shot at estimating an outside view on the question:  I just read through wikipedia on the largest viral epidemics since 1900. There are too many to deal with and most are too small to be useful for this purpose), but I focused on the ones that were largest (>100M infected) and most deadly (>100k deaths) were: \n     -- 1918 \"Spanish Flu\" / Influenza A virus subtype H1N1\n     -- 1957 \"Asian Flu\" / Influenza A virus subtype H2N2\n     -- 1968 \"Hong Kong Flu\" / Influenza A virus subtype H3N2\n     -- 2009 \"Swine Flu\" / Pandemic H1N1/09 virus (kind of different that the ones above. Much lower mortality rate) I recognize that none of these are coronaviruses and are therefore of uncertain use as models for constructing an outside view on COVID-19. Still, it's the data we have so... In 3 of the 4 flu cases (Swine flu being the exception), there was apparently mutation that lead to second waves that differed from the original in terms of a) demographics affected, b) more contagious; c) higher mortality rate. In 3 of 4 cases the second (and subsequent in a couple of cases) waves were bigger than the first. In 4 of 4 cases the timing of the 2nd wave was in the fall/winter following the initial wave, although one didn't start until January.  By comparison, almost all of the smaller epidemics I glanced at (10-15 viral epidemics) didn't seem to show evidence of a significant mutation which makes sense because the likelihood of mutation is proportional to the number of people infected. Those were generally in the thousands or tens of thousands. (Note that many had an initial mutation that brought them into existence and some had many small mutations which didn't change their character; neither of  which I'm counting.)  My conclusions are: \n1) in no case was the mutated version completely different than the first. They were just slightly nastier, slightly more contagious versions of the already nasty original\n2)  the probability of mutation seems to be real. Maybe 50-75%\n3) The probability of mutation should be roughly proportional to he number of people infected. So if you say that at >100M infected the probability of significant mutation is ~75%; and at <100k infected the probability is low, like say ~1%, that implies that COVID with 10-20M people infected (??) we are probably around ~20-25%?  Epidemiologists seem to think that risk of mutation is highest in places were there is a high degree of chaos and danger, like in war zones. The reason is apparently that evolutionary forces in normal civilian environments leads to lower mortality because people who get sick are quarantined. However, this is apparently less true or even reversed in very harsh situations like war, refugee camps or extreme poverty: even very sick people can't be quarantined effectively so higher severity mutations can spread. Curious if others have thoughts (or links to sources) on how to estimate an outside view on the possibility of mutation and how that might affect the odds on this question .

Since some of the 30,000 cases per day self-present and are not picked up by testing, that suggests many cases with moderate symptoms.  Those with mild symptoms self-quarantine and/or do not infect people now given the lockdown.  Some people we know have no symptoms and would only get identified if they were randomly tested.  So, suppose we now have 300,000 cases per day, or 2.1 million per week.  If that is the case, it really depends on whether we are testing enough people in the Fall of 2021.  I think testing will increase, not because the Federal government wants more testing, but because there will be demand for testing and antibody testing that will increase the test supply.
