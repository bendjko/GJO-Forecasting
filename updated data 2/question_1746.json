What does current polling look like? - Big thanks to @benjuliano1 for the polling statistics. Firstly, the caveats - i am fully aware this is one poll but i dont have time and polling is hard to get so based on this though I would award couple of percentage points. With 80% likely to vote 41% are currently in support of it. I cant see that mind changing and given the amount of money being thrown at it and the one-sidedness of it - I can only see I dont knows breaking one way. (that last point needs to be challenged) - Money for me adds another 5% 3. What would drive people to vote yes in this election? I think a good indicator of that is whether you use it. I think this because it would make the advertising and arguments as well as the emotional reactions to this a lot more salient. With this in mind california has a huge amount of Uber and Lyft use.

"], [89039, "2020-08-20T02:59:37Z", [0.63], "Our base rate here is debatable. An examination of  ballot initiatives in California tells us that Californians have followed the money 70 percent of the time over the last decade. That is to say that the side that has spent the most campaigning for or against any particular issue has won 70 percent of November polls since 2010. That number - 30 out of 49 - feels high. Numbers have trended upward in recent years. 76 percent of ballot measures were approved in 2016 and 100 percent (out of 6) in 2014. But the median is 55 percent which I think is a more reasonable figure so that\u2019s where I would start. [1] To be certain the apps have thrown everything they have at this fight. $110m to be precise versus $1.8m against. [2] Beginning at 55 percent, we can start to add some additional information. My first consideration of the question revolved around the stereotype that Californians are quite liberal politically and would therefore support the expanded protections for workers that Prop 22 provides. That changed when I found out that the action was initiated by Uber and Lyft Forty-five percent - they would see right through the corporate con job. But if you actually read the text of the proposal, these companies are offering a pretty good deal: 120% of minimum wage in addition to health and accident coverage and working hour limits. [3] This is the key to why opponents have floundered in their attempts to block the move, it\u2019s difficult to make a concise case against someone who wants to give in to most of your demands. So far, small-scale protests have had little to scare the tech juggernauts and drivers have struggled to find a unifying message. [4] Of course none of this is an act of pure altruism. Ride-sharing services have failed to settle the crucial policy questions surrounding their business model, namely the status of their workers, hence November\u2019s ballot. Challenges in court have never really abated since the companies rose to global prominence. Two more are on the way as State Attorney General and the Office of the Labor Commissioner have filed separate suits alleging violations of employment law and wage theft respectively. [5][6] This and the accompanying mixed regard in which it leaves the innovators is something voters will have to weigh. It seems, too, something their leadership has tried to address as well. The content of the ballot measure and the way proponents have pitched it shows they have learned much from the days of showdowns with NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio. At least for now, this \u2018mistakes were made\u2019 approach seems to be working. Polls show a 2:1 majority in favor of the ballot measure with around a third of voters still in play. [7] In terms of a solid forecast this is the way I see it. We have a well-funded campaign in a context in which spending has been a large if not decisive historical variable. This is contrasted with a much weaker opposition which is a favorable situation but doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the race is a foregone conclusion. Just look at Proposition 19 (Medical Marijuana) in 2010. The public seem to be supportive of the Uber/Doordash/Lyft olive branch against the backdrop of this latest never-ending legal saga but things are complicated. People want convenience but must decide at what cost this comes and who to believe in terms of what the cost actually is.
