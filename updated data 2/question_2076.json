October ONS report has inflation at 4.2%, largest contributors to annualised inflation increase have been:\n1. Housing and household services\n2. Transport\n3. Restaurants & hotels Where (1) is more impactful that (2) and (3) combined. \"The main upward pressure came from electricity, gas and other fuels, which contributed 0.59 percentage points to the CPIH 12-month inflation rate. \" - October saw a huge rise in wholesale prices, which has since seen a drawback. The rise was so great that it's no longer considered beneficial to search for fixed rate tariffs as the variable rate cap is likely cheaper (https://www.which.co.uk/news/2021/10/energy-price-rises-what-you-can-do-now/).  The price cap has now likely been reached for most households who are on variable rate tariffs. People's energy costs are likely at or near a peak (until the cap is revised in April) and the main source of increases in the energy inflation basket for November is likely to be people who are coming off fixed tarriffs onto variable tarriffs and people using more energy to heat homes (cap is /unit energy so increase in usage will still affect the annualised rate). I don't think we will see another rise of the same magnitude because of the cap but it will still go up. The rate is annualised and energy prices were actually falling this time last year, so unless we see a corresponding drop in consumer prices (unlikely, since wholesale prices are trading at rates that are forcing utility companies buying on spot out of business) we will continue to see modest increase in this area. I don't think there is anything falling in price significantly enough to outweigh the energy impact and bring us back below 3.4%. To drop below 4.1% we'll need to see something else, e.g. motor fuel, food, rents or consumer goods fall in price."], [94872, "2021-11-18T05:18:24Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.4, 0.5], ""], [102702, "2021-11-18T04:28:54Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.38, 0.62], "From 113.4, the index would need to climb just another 0.2 to get above 4.1%.

To understand how the pc will change in coming months we have to look at the actual index, and the pc change is influenced, not only by the change in the coming months but the relative changes a year ago. The index is has been rising at an average of 0.6 for the past few months.  If each of the next 3 months continue at this rate then the annual percentage change will be 4.6pc. If we vary the rate increase up of down by 0.2 each month this gives a plus or minus range of 4pc to 5.1pc. The UK is having all kinds of problems with supply at the moment as result of COVID, brexit and who know what else of a mess is going on.  Power, fuel and delivery of items are all having a bit of a crisis which affects prices, now.  And the upward trend in these items is all happening at the same time.  This is a scenario where a perfect storm could happen, comparing against a stagnant period last year leading to some surprising jumps in the pc rate. So all the trend tend to be on the higher side in the next 3 month short term.
