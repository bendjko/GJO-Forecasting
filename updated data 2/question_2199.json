There is an interesting behavior in all cases but Denmark: in the last six months, the proportion of people with only one dose constantly decreases. This might seem obvious since most people who got the first dose will get the second one; however, this could also mean that the vaccination rate is slowing for good, probably approaching a ceiling level for the country. I suspect the anomaly for Denmark that happened in Nov 2021 is due to the introduction of a new population: children 5-11 years old (https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/denmark-officials-reason-give-covid-vaccines-82822229). That boosted the vaccination rate, but then it plateaued in two-months time. All of this to say that I believe the only significant game changer to increase the percentage by 5% or more would be the introduction of a new population. And according to the German site, almost all the people who got the first dose have already gotten the second one, including children 5-11 (https://impfdashboard.de/). Recently the EU commissioned a new type of vaccine that doesn't contain RNA but only proteins (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/21/germany-hopes-nuvaxovid-protein-based-covid-vaccine-will-sway-sceptics) and it has been proposed that skeptics would opt to get this treatment. So far there are few doses available, and most anti-vaxxers would still not get this jab.

And it's not necessarily prescient of the next 5 months since I have baked an assumption of decreasing take-up going forward. So I'm going to attempt another extrapolation now. Days remaining: 140 Current fully vaxx rate/day = ~0.11%/day which is approx inline with people who got there first dose pre-xmas. However since then first dose rates have halved. They were raised by roughly a factor of 2 for probably around a month once you take into account the ramp up and dip in the middle [see https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&time=2021-10-21..latest&facet=none&pickerSort=asc&pickerMetric=location&Metric=People+vaccinated&Interval=7-day+rolling+average&Relative+to+Population=true&Color+by+test+positivity=false&country=~DEU ]. There was a contraction in second doses over Christmas, but seems to have recovered now. I suspect we have about 2 weeks left at this raised rate. So let's say the rest of Jan goes through at 0.11/day. After that we should drop down to the current first dose rate which is now around 0.05/day. So let's assume that's February taken care of:\n- Jan, 19 days @ 0.11 = 2.09\n-Feb, 30 (I know it's only 28 days but for the purpose of this lets use a normal month length) @ 0.05 = 1.5 Which takes us to 75.27. So that bin is out by March.  If we assume that rate sustains until the question resolves, that's another 91 days @ 0.05 or 4.55. So even if that is the case it will still resolve into bin 3. I don't think it's likely that rate will be sustained though. I thought that when vaccination was opened to children 5-11 it would increase the rate significantly, it looks like there was an uplift but it's hard to tell if that was because of kids or Omicron. I think the only thing now that will push this over 80 is mandatory vaccination for the general public including children. However I am sceptical that this will happen, especially once Omicron is in decline. I also doubt it will get Germany over 80% before the time limit on this question.

We're already about 150 days post-inflection point with Germany, so our ability to extrapolate is a bit limited. What happens between days 150 and 300? Looking next at countries with higher vaccination rates- this seems also to be the case in Belgium, where the vaccination rate is about 75%. It's not the case in Portugal, where the inflection point happened much later. So here's one theory of the case- the period in the middle section of the S-curve is when everyone who's pretty enthusiastic about getting vaccinated goes out to do it. Then the linear portion post-inflection point is the gradual trickling-in of everyone who is willing to get it but not particularly enthusiastic. That curve will level off as the vaccination effort runs into the die-hard never-vaxxers. So I have two instrumental questions- (1) how many die-hards are there in Germany? and (2) what does linear (or quadratic) growth imply about the vaccination rate on June 1st. (2) first - quadratic growth implies 72% (95% CI 70-74), while linear growth implies 82% (95% CI 81.7-83.4). I think that pretty much runs the gamut, and makes me think that my probability mass should be pretty solidly between 70 and 82, all else being equal. If I take the quadratic growth assumption seriously, then I'm almost certain to be between 70 and 75. Likewise, if I take linear growth seriously, I'm almost certain to be between 80 and 85. Which is more likely? Let's think about (1). Per WaPo (https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/12/03/germany-vaccine-mandate-omicron/), more than 71% have already received at least one dose of the vaccine, which to me puts the low end of 70-75 pretty squarely out of the running unless things start to slow a lot.

Whether or not \"more than 85.00%\" are attainable, wil critically depend on the Novavax subunit product (\"Nuvaxovid\") becoming available and recommended by the STIKO (\"Staendige Impfkommission\") soon in large amounts, and on improvements in vaccination logistics (mass vaccination sites, order management etc) under the newly inaugurated army specialist Carsten Breuer, now responsible for streamlining processes.\nhttps://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carsten_Breuer\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kommando_Territoriale_Aufgaben_der_Bundeswehr"], [45594, "2021-12-25T12:44:39Z", [0.0, 0.3, 0.3, 0.2, 0.2], ""], [79508, "2021-12-25T10:42:24Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.47, 0.47, 0.06], ""], [29054, "2021-12-24T17:07:34Z", [0.0, 0.34, 0.59, 0.07, 0.0], ""], [20504, "2021-12-24T15:39:13Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.37, 0.57, 0.06], "-3% to 75-80, +3% to 80-85"], [99407, "2021-12-24T03:01:11Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.35, 0.55, 0.1], ""], [99407, "2021-12-24T03:00:26Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.35, 0.65, 0.0], ""], [101036, "2021-12-23T23:18:34Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.29, 0.58, 0.12], ""], [102006, "2021-12-23T22:56:18Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.45, 0.45, 0.1], ""], [86353, "2021-12-23T10:40:11Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.55, 0.4, 0.05], ""], [79508, "2021-12-22T17:40:55Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.49, 0.45, 0.06], ""], [103250, "2021-12-21T22:17:14Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5], ""], [79508, "2021-12-21T20:46:00Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.44, 0.06], ""], [103770, "2021-12-21T20:03:00Z", [0.0, 0.03, 0.25, 0.54, 0.18], ""], [103258, "2021-12-21T16:50:56Z", [0.0, 0.03, 0.45, 0.49, 0.03], ""], [101031, "2021-12-21T08:54:10Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.28, 0.57, 0.15], ""], [79069, "2021-12-20T21:48:00Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.22, 0.7, 0.08], "Further to rationale on Dec 1st, the recent approval of Nuvaxovid for rollout January \u201822 should help add 1-1.5% to the total, to get just above 80% before approval of vaccination for children expected in March/April.\nNuvaxovid, from Novavax, is a \u2018traditional\u2019 type of protein vaccine which should appeal to some of the vaccine hesitant who are uncomfortable with the novel mRNA vaccines.

Since my last forecast there have been some major developments:\n- Omicron now expected to cause another wave (as observed before, as cases go up, so does the number of people getting vaccines, but only to the point of a case rate plateau - maybe this is due to increased media coverage as a wave grows?)\n- Lockdown for the unvaccinated\n- Merkel suggesting vaccines may be mandated in the future\n- Younger children look to be getting the vaccine offer in the new year (Under twelves make up ~10% of the population) All these are things which are likely to increase the vaccination rate. There doesn't seem to have been anything that would offset this signal in the reverse direction, so I'm going to re-adjust my forecast. Firstly I can't find any data breaking down German vaccination status by age. However I can find Austrian examples and they were recently in a similar place with vaccine numbers https://vaccinetracker.ecdc.europa.eu/public/extensions/COVID-19/vaccine-tracker.html#age-group-tab. Looks like 15-18 age bracker are 60% fully vaccinated, and significantly fewer 10-14's (I am assuming they are not giving the vaccine to under 12's, so that's why that is so low). Esssentially I think the best take-up to be expected by end of spring would be 50%. It seems unlikely it would be mandated for under 12s and I suspect that there will be more hesistance to vaccinate as people get younger. My assumption here at the moment is that about 25% of the 10 million will be vaccinated in the Spring should this come available before March. Secondly the unvaccinated lockdown + vaccine mandates. At the moment there is no mandate and I think they will be reluctant to make one in practice. It certainly doesn't seem to have fed into the first dose numbers over the last week so the threat doesn't seem to be working. I think we will see in the next week or so if the unvaccinated lockdown is having any effect but I'm not sure it will. If you're totally unvaccinated now, and don't really want to get one, then getting your first dose today will mean at least 21 more days before you are able to come out of lockdown. Omicron is a huge question mark but I think there will be diminishing returns in terms of vaccine uptake increasing with cases, as more of the unvaccinated are more strongly opposed to getting the vaccine. All the above considered, I think that a 2.5% addition to my initial base case is needed to account for the under 12's being vaccinated. I'm still skeptical of getting above 80% uptake though.

First dose uptake has doubled over the last 30 days, and I think will keep increasing beyond the peak of the wave due to ongoing public concern, especially now there is also talk of further mandates, another variant, potential regional lockdowns, and even compulsory vaccination on the horizon. For the latter, I expect the proposal to go to debate in Parliament, and perhaps not pass - partly as the motion would not be til February/March by which time we'll either have quite low cases, or an Omicron wave. In either case it is a contentious proposal that may be less effective than positive encouragement at a time when the second dose rate should already be quite high.\nhttps://www.dw.com/en/covid-incoming-chancellor-scholz-wants-vaccine-mandate-in-germany/a-59979157\nhttps://www.reuters.com/world/europe/rise-german-covid-19-infections-flattens-2021-11-30/ Back to doses, and dealing with the Delta wave; I expect the first dose uptake to translate to second doses approx 6 weeks later, continuing the current trend. So recent 1st dose increases will affect totals from the end of December. The increases for October and November are approx 2% each; I'm expecting a peak through December and January upwards of 3.2%/m, before the rate tapers back rapidly. This easily clears 75% during March. But coupled with this we have a new variant and threat of a possible new wave starting in January. The jury may be out on whether Omicron is either more transmissible, more vaccine resistant, or both (and perhaps less virulent) but either way it is clear evidence of the risks a new variant presents. So even if existing vaccines have lower efficacy I think they will still be considered beneficial, while any newer vaccine could easily take 3-4 months to develop:\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/30/eu-medical-agency-omicron-vaccine-could-be-approved-in-3-4-months-.html There is also the likely option of vaccine approval for children. As I have commented before I think this is likely to be approved and rollout from late March at the earliest, and perhaps cover 25-40% of that age group within the time frame, dependant on efficacy, which would comprise approx 2-3% of the total population.\nRegarding mandating the vaccine, I think encouragement would be less contentious, and they may be attempting this with a recent push for '30M jabs by Christmas' as an unrealistically high bar to see what's possible.

Scholz, a Social Democrat, who is expected to be sworn in as Angela Merkel\u2019s successor in the coming week, reportedly told a meeting of regional leaders he was in favour of a cross-party initiative to make vaccines mandatory, as well as requiring customers at non-essential stores to show proof of vaccination or recovery from the virus.\u201cAs a delegate I would certainly vote in favour, to make that very clear,\u201d Der Spiegel reported Scholz as saying.

In order to achieve this, they will include new categories of people who are allowed to administer jabs. This will most likely include pharmacists. However, final conclusions from the meeting won't be published before Thursday, according to the statement.\"\n\"According to Reuters news agency, Scholz also supported the idea of introducing so-called 2G rules for customers in retail stores, meaning they must be either vaccinated (\"geimpft\") or have recovered (\"genesen\") from COVID-19. The rules would not apply in supermarkets or drugstores.\"\nhttps://www.dw.com/en/covid-incoming-chancellor-scholz-wants-vaccine-mandate-in-germany/a-59979157 Everyone age 15+ in Germany is 87% of the population. Austria is considering making vaccination required for everyone age 14+, as 14 is the age at which criminal responsibility starts; for Germany, it is also age 14. If Germany mandated vaccines for everyone age 14+, then that mandate would apply to just under 88% of the population, although some exemptions would likely be granted. I don't see why a mandate wouldn't be applied to everyone for whom the vaccines have been showed to be safe and effective, which is expected to be age 1+ by some time early in the new year; school children are required to be vaccinated for everything else, so why not Covid? So, as I see it, a vaccine mandate, if it's applied, would likely apply to somewhere between ~85% and 99% of the population. On the other hand, if Germany's current Delta wave soon comes under control, and there are hints that that's starting to happen now, then there will be less political support for a vaccine mandate. But, again, I think Germany is tired of endless cases, hospitalizations and deaths, with all of the effects those have on society, and they rightfully see vaccination as a way to hugely dampen this cycle. So I think the chance of a vaccine mandate being imposed is fairly high, especially given the incoming Chancellor's position on it. And if a vaccine mandate is imposed, it will likely have a deadline within the forecast period, although Omicron and other potential variants may complicate matters if Delta fades substantially after 1-3 months but Omicron vaccines are not yet widely available. It's not clear whether Omicron vaccines would be widely available in Germany by June 1; they might be widely available a bit after that. But, it should be pointed out that Omicron is so different from Delta that it's fairly likely, imo, that they could co-circulate without one sweeping the other, much like different subtypes of influenza A (H1N1, H3N2). Delta is so contagious, and immunity to it fades so quickly, that if it didn't even evolve (which is impossible; viruses always evolve), it could circulate every year. So even if Delta fades to low levels and Omicron cases rise, I think we should not count Delta out. And I think that consideration makes the application of a vaccine mandate with the current vaccine more likely in the forecast period.  So, with a fair amount of uncertainty, I'd say that a vaccine mandate is fairly likely, and that if one is passed, it would likely be applied with a deadline of somewhere around Feb or March, depending on the political circumstances and currently circulating variants. I think Germany might follow Austria's lead of requiring everyone ages 14+ to be vaccinated, although perhaps they would require vaccinations of children as well, because a) children get infected and can be seriously affected, albeit rarely, b) children spread Covid when infected, and c) children can get long Covid, which can affect them the rest of their lives. (It's somewhat mystifying to me why Austria's mandate won't likely include children under age 14.) So I suspect that with a vaccine mandate, it's very likely that >85% of the population would be fully vaccinated, although it could end up being on the edge between bins 4 and 5, as perhaps up to ~2% of the population might get exemptions. I think Germany will reach ~70% by the end of the year at current rates, and when the vaccines are approved for young children, which is expected early next year, that will add another ~5% of the population to the ranks of the fully vaccinated. If Germany actually gives another 30M vaccine doses before Christmas, that could add another, say, 10M fully vaccinated people, or ~12% of the population, putting the total at ~80% by Christmas. So, in the absence of a vaccine mandate, with young children being vaccinated and an ongoing trickle of everyone else, I think it's very unlikely that Germany will end up <75%. Without a vaccine mandate, I think bin 4 is most likely."], [99943, "2021-12-01T14:24:47Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.39, 0.36, 0.2], ""], [97945, "2021-12-01T12:43:16Z", [0.01, 0.05, 0.4, 0.4, 0.14], ""], [103410, "2021-12-01T05:30:44Z", [0.0, 0.03, 0.45, 0.46, 0.06], ""], [18318, "2021-12-01T04:31:06Z", [0.55, 0.3, 0.1, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [60501, "2021-11-30T23:11:05Z", [0.0, 0.5, 0.4, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [99407, "2021-11-30T22:48:47Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.75, 0.2, 0.0], ""], [99943, "2021-11-30T20:36:23Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.39, 0.4, 0.2], "Still, if Omicron takes off and Delta dies down, more people might wait for an Omicron vaccine in the new year."], [99943, "2021-11-30T20:33:59Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.28, 0.4, 0.31], "I worried that Omicron might make a lot of people not want to get the current vaccine, but that doesn't seem to be happening.

The expected slow-down in adult vaccinations would probably be offset with increased vaccination of younger Germans who have not been previously eligible in most versions of this scenario.   Although there is a currently intensifying debate on whether to introduce a universal vaccination mandate in Germany, there are some important degrees of freedom here that I don\u2019t yet see much discussion on in previous comments. Particularly, if a mandate were to be introduced, it remains a very open question as to 1) what the timing of enforcement and 2) what the consequences of failing to comply would be. If, for example, a mandate were introduced 2 months from now and people had 6 months to comply, then the mandate would probably be largely irrelevant to the outcome of the question. Similarly, if there were only minor financial penalties for non-compliance\u2014perhaps equivalent to getting a parking ticket\u2014then this too would be unlikely to cause behavior change with the \u201chard core\u201d 10-20% of folks  who are apparently quite unwilling to receive the vaccine. If a \u201cspot checking\u201d approach to enforcement were implemented, this too would probably significantly reduce the number of reluctant people vaccinated. In short: even a mandate will not necessarily drive numbers up significantly from the base case (bin #3) and bin #5 seems exceptionally ambitious and difficult to see realistically unfold unless drastic changes in public opinion occur somehow. I\u2019m therefore only marginally increasing my probability of bin #4 to represent chances of \u201cmandate-boosted\u201d vaccination outcomes. A few other points impacting my forecast:\nThe German health care system is functionally quite de-centralized and introducing any mandate would require a new law.  This de-centralization also has lead  to (and continues to cause!) significant bottle necks and logistical challenges in getting the right doses to where they are needed, slowing progress in vaccination counts compared to expectations that some here might have based on an \u201cefficient German\u201d stereotype. The thinking here is: the more vaccines are delayed, the more unvaccinated people get covid and recover, and so the more people won\u2019t see the need to get vaccinated in our timeframe\u2014the German system will recognize these people as having temporary \u201cimmunity\u201d, so they won\u2019t be denied access to restaurants, etc.\nThere seems to be a lot of uncertainty on this, but it seems that a significant fraction of parents who are themselves willing to be vaccinated also seem to be hesitant to vaccinate their own children, and there is much discussion regarding disagreements between parents in the same family in this topic. All in all, there seem to be many possible drivers for a disappointingly small number of Germans to become vaccinated over the question\u2019s timeframe.

From now until June it's likely they can achieve this.\n(I got Germany Vaccination Rates here https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/germany/ )  So, I think it's a fair bet to say they'll be beyond 70% relatively soon.  For 70-80% bands, i'm being a bit aggressive but again I am confident they will get past 75% based on how they are doing now. I think even past 80 is quite likely, but I still left 3% chance of it sitting between 75% and 80% if there is some slowing of rollout as a consequence of the current surge in cases.  80-85% Has some probability, depending on people's vaccine reluctancy. over 85% I've seen other forecasts putting this quite low,but I looked at support for the AfD party as a proxy for hardcore antivaxxers, and their support is currently sitting around 10%. So I would put an upper bound on vaccination at 90%. If that is the case, it seems reasonable they can slowly reach over 85% by June.

Also thought a bit more about the decay in people to vaccinate (excluded by age or hesistancy) as the % vaccinated moves towards 100% Current increase/day fully vaccinated:\n~0.06% of the population  At that rate (assuming it continued flatly). Current fully vaccinated % is 67.43, there are 191 days inbetween, that gives an increase of 11.46%, taking us just over 67%. So the base case is that we get 75-80, assuming that rate of increase keeps up.  But that is a big assumption. How long will any 'spike' in people coming forward for vaccination last? From August - September there was a spike in cases in Germany, which is the first such spike to have occured towards the end of the vaccination drive. It coincides with an increase in people receiving their first dose. Cases started rising rapidly in early August and then plateaud at the end of August, and the effect on first doses was that they increased linearly up to that plateau, from 0.09 -> 0.13 (e.g. a factor of 1.4), before falling back to the previous pre-spike plateau and below.  It looks like we are seeing the same increase in first doses again this time around - first doses up to 0.06 from 0.04. No lockdown has been enacted yet, and cases are higher than they were in August, so perhaps there is still some increase to be had in the uplift. However once cases start to plateau, then we can expect the number vaccinated/day to fall below the current pre-spike baseline of 0.04/day.

So, my initial forecast will be based on a reference scenario of ~0.046% increase / day (roughly 38k people/day), which has been apparently observed over the past 5 days on average.\nObviously, there are many other social factors to consider such as vaccine hesitancy (particularly in areas like Saxony), or the possibility of more aggressive government mandating (and enforcement!) of vaccination status in the future. These factors are hopefully well accounted for by the subjective and broad uncertainty range that I\u2019m placing around my back-of-the envelope straight-line calculation that would predict ~75.5% full vaccination, if every day until June were like the last 5 days."], [99943, "2021-11-19T22:32:58Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.28, 0.4, 0.31], "Revising upward because the vaccination rate is currently increasing."], [99943, "2021-11-19T22:28:02Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.31, 0.33, 0.31], "1.7% added to the fully vaxxed total in the past 30 days, or about 0.4%/week. They're on the slowing part of the S curve, so I would expect that to be the max rate without expanding the eligible population. On the other hand, Austria has just mandated vaccinations for the entire population: https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/19/europe/austria-national-lockdown-intl/index.html That could also conceivably happen in Germany. 67.7% fully vaccinated as of Nov 17, 2021. 196 days to June 1, 2022. If vaccination continued at the same rate, we could expect 67.7% + 196/30 * 1.7% = 67.7% + 11.1% = 78.8% to be fully vaxxed by June 1. But for the age 12+ population, vaccination will likely speed up slightly during any surge, and likely slow down overall over the forecast period, unless there are vaccine mandates for employment, etc., or nationwide. Barring mandates and without expanding the eligible population, I would expect approx 75% to be fully vaxxed by June 1; any finer analysis requires more work. But will there be a vaccine mandate? Also, while vaccines are currently approved for people age 12+, approval for children under age 12 is anticipated in early 2022. That will add some percentage to the total as well. About 14% of the population is age 0-14, so ~10% is under age 12. If 50% of them become fully vaxxed in the forecast period, that will be 5% of the population.\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/health-58516207\nhttps://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-digest-germany-to-offer-vaccines-to-children-in-2022/a-59238911 So, if, say, around 75% of the population were likely to be fully vaxxed by June 1 without expanding the eligible population to age <12, and if expanding it to children adds in the ballpark of 5%, then we're at 80%. Those might be underestimates for both. I really can't picture the total being <75% by June 1. Just under or above 80% is very plausible.
