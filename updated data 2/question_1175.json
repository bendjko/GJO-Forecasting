See here for more info: https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/841007 Other judgments: \n- EWP estimate at 3.8%. [1] \n- Crowd forecast here is 1%. Inside view: \n- EWP: \"In response to a perceived government-sponsored land grab and subversion of Oromo rights, mass public protests broke out across Oromia Region in November 2015, to which Ethiopian security forces responded with violence and repression against civilians.\" So EWP already counts one such episode in Ethiopia.\n- Overall, the situation seems to have improved a lot: \"He made peace with long-time regional rivals like Eritrea and Egypt, released journalists, invited back opposition groups, acknowledged that prisoners suffered torture and abuse, and increased the place of women in power. He also promised to open up the economy for private investment, kickstarted a green initiative to transform the capital, and rolled out a visa-on-arrival push for African travelers. Emboldened by these reforms, donor groups returned, with Ethiopia reportedly attracting a record $13 billion of inflows in the past year. Marathoner Feyisa Lilesa, who protested the previous government at the finish line at the Rio Olympics in 2016, also went back. During his East Africa tour last month, French president Emmanuel Macron commended Abiy\u2019s transformative agenda, saying he \u201cprofoundly changed\u201d Paris\u2019s vision of Addis Ababa. Human Rights Watch staff who cover Ethiopia were also permitted to visit Ethiopia for the first time in eight years.\" [2]\n- While elections (which can often spark violence) will be held next year, different factions recently signed a peace pact. [3]\n- There is of course still communal violence [4][5][6]. Some even argue that it's gotten worse. I'm torn. Overall judgment:\n- I don't see a lot of reason to diverge from the base rate. The accounts I read seem similar to what I would expect, given the base rate. Somewhat on the higher side perhaps. I'd estimate 3%.
