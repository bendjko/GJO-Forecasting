Looking at the Cabo Ligado report, ISIL had not, as of 1/8/21, reported any deaths of RDF or any other troops. Thus, for the time being, once assume that if there had been any such deaths, ISIL would be shouting it from the rooftops. On the other hand, it is probably early days for such events to be reported by Mozambique or RDF, albeit there are certainly suggestions that some RDF have been evacuated and may have been seriously injured. Also worth noting that SADC forces, SANDF, ZDF, ADF, BDF are still arriving in Mozambique. So, the battle is not yet won. ISIL may change tactics in the short term to counter the combined MDF / RDF push and the ongoing build up of SADC troops. In all likelihood, guerilla tactics and warfare are likely to ensue.

Probability Forces Get Deployed: 66% -> SADC forces have been approved and it appears Zimbabwe had a brigade ready to be deployed (https://www.thezimbabwemail.com/main/zimbabwean-army-ready-for-mozambique-deployment-to-combat-insurgents/).\n2.

Probability Forces Are Aggressive toward Insurgent: 70% -> Due to the ties with international terrorism combined with an asymmetrical relationship between global business interests and the government, the forces are likely to be more aggressive.  A more aggressive response will lead to more missions, which will lead to the death of member of the forces from another African country.  \nRandom Probability of an Accident: 2% -> Foreign forces in a country are susceptible to a lack of knowledge about geography.  This could lead to foreign forces accidentally driving into a \"lethal confrontation\" unprepared.  Simply stumbling onto a large drug shipment going through the region (https://www.occrp.org/en/daily/13980-heroin-and-war-crimes-conflict-rages-on-in-mozambique) could be the spark.
