The Arab countries was to keep sending us their oil, and MBS might be in real trouble if America elected a president who had a problem with the murder of an American resident in their Turkish consulate.   The attack would have to come from criminals or North Korea.   The criminals can likely find easier and more fruitful targets around the world.  North Korea frankly I do not understand.  They did attack Sony when they did not like a film.  Yet, I cannot think of a reason why they would attack the NYSE.

If I could, I would place it somewhere around or below 0.5%. I am basing this on the fact trading itself works primarily based on trust, if that's lost, everything crumbles. NYSE *publicly* admitting it has been hacked? How many times did that happen in the past? Twitter news, AI going wrong and so on news, yes, indeed, but even those are extremely rare to appear in public media vs the number of know and unknown attacks that (should) happen to NYSE or other markets.

There's something wrong with Figure 1, the graph showing the \"Annual distribution of cyberattacks (accident date) on firms listed in the top five stock markets (1984\u20132017)\". There's an obvious trend being formed in the past and it's easy to explain why the number of attacks grew: the internet and it's expansion & the number of people having access to it & the number of people that started to get into coding & the number of people wanting to get rich out of their knowledge OR the number or people having an interest in attacking those markets and finding a mean do to do so online. The wrong thing about the graph is... it suddenly turns back to the horizontal axis. Really? How can that be? Even the actual number of reported attacks is ridiculously low. That points to my first fact, there's no interest in making attacks to NYSE public. Another possible explication would be suddenly firewalls and security measures got so good they keep attackers off - they haven't. Some doors got closed in the past years, leading to obvious and low complexity vulnerabilities, but that's just a fraction of what can be accessed. The greatest vulnerability is that humans are operating the security systems in place and humans inherently have flaws.

If such an attack were to occur again, it seems very unlikely it would result in a cross-market trading halt.

However, who would  launch a cyber attack against the NYSE?  It would require someone with an awful lot of sophistication, either a government or a very knowledgeable organized computer crime group.  A solo hacker (someone weighing 400 lbs sitting on his  bed) is unlikely.  Which foreign governments would want to cyber attack? The obvious ones are North Korea, Russia and Iran.  There might be a few others, but I can't think of them right now.  North Korea would be by far the most likely.  They cyber hacked Sony when they did not like a movie so they probably have the ability but why would they?  Why do they launch missiles and develop nuclear weapons? I suspect because they want to be a player on the world stage without entering into a self-destructive war.  A cyber attack would do just that.  Russian likely would not do such a thing as long as their favorite president was in the White House and afterward probably would not want the resulting post-attack sanctions.   Next, Iran would.  They attacked Saudi Arabia recently with drones.  Iran hates us, but they probably do not have the ability and would likely attack a greater Satan first, e.g., Saudi Arabia or Kuwait.  There are some very sophisticated organized crime groups.  However, the NYSE is a very sophisticated target with sophisticated defenses.  No doubt the NSA and other organizations see the  NYSE as a likely target.  So, it would be difficult for someone to try to install ransomware or steal data, which are the usual goals.   Nevertheless, recently the City of New Orleans suffered a somewhat successful cyber attack but was unable to profit from it.  I imagine any organized crime group would considered any attack on the NYSE would have to be much more sophisticated and would provoke a severe response from the US intelligence agencies.  \nThey have smaller fish t to fry, but the New Orleans attack serves as one of many warnings.

There have been a few times when technical glitches [1] or geopolitical events [2] brought trading to a halt, but these were not related to cyberattacks. There have, however, been smaller-scale cyber attacks on stock exchanges across the globe, with one report finding that about half of exchanges were the target of cyber attacks in a given year [3].  The base rate suggests the likelihood of a cyberattack, especially one so disruptive so as to halt cross-market trading, is extremely low (I'd say nearly 0%). But it must be acknowledged that there are ongoing geopolitical risks that make such attacks on the NYSE possible - specifically, there is the possibility that state actors might target the NYSE as a way to target the U.S. In particular, both Iran [4] and North Korea [5] have shown that there are capable of mounting potent cyberattacks and they both have reason to target the US at the moment. As a result of this geopolitical risk, I am assigning this a probability of 3% instead of 0%.
