With their new lockdown restrictions that went into effect on January 5th, coronavirus cases have steadily decreased.  Given these restrictions and the current rate of about 200K cases per week, cases climbing another 500K in 10 days doesn't seem possible.\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/50b5563a-c025-44ce-a135-2eb13be96c07"], [96450, "2021-01-23T10:03:53Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.98, 0.02, 0.0], ""], [87880, "2021-01-23T03:25:46Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [80790, "2021-01-22T22:47:50Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], "3.5m just reached with 10 days to go.

Since, there are two weeks remaining, 300K new cases per week need to be reported to end up in the 4M-4.5M range. The graphs for COVID-19 are exponential and thus do not function on strict averages. Exponential averages weight the more recent data more. The last three weeks show averages of over 300K new cases in the UK.

The new lockdown and the end of the festive period are likely to reduce the R rate but as the new variant is spreading 50-70% faster and the current lockdown is less stringent than in March, it is far from guaranteed that this will reduce the R rate to under 1. The affect of vaccination is unlikely to have a major impact on cases before the 1st February. For this forecast I consider three scenarios:\n\u2022 Scenario 1: Lockdown has limited impact and R rate stays above 1 and retains the midpoint of the current growth estimate (3%). The new variant is still responsible for under 50% of infections in many UK regions, it's full impact will not be felt until it has become the dominant variant throughout the UK (which seems somewhat innevitable now). This effect could offset the beneficial impact of lockdown. It's also important to bear in mind that tighter restrictions might be brought in if exponential growth continues. This scenario would lead to 4531063 cases by 1st February.  This is very close to the 4.5 million cut-off and so I assign this scenario 60:40 between the >4.5M interval and the 3.5-4M interval. I rate this scenario as 20% likely. \n\u2022 Scenario 2: Lockdown succeeds in keeping cases stable (R=1) and so the case rate stays constant. Between now and 1 Feb this would be expected to add another 1,129,576 cases to the total giving a total of 4,018,999. This scenario only goes above 4 million on the last day so very small deviations could put it into the lower interval. The probability I assign to this strategy will therefore be split 40:60 between the 3.5-4 and 4-4.5 intervals. I give this scenario a 50% likelihood.\n\u2022 Scenario 3: Lockdown succeeds in getting the R rate under 1. Let's say it gets down to 0.9 with the new variant and Covid generation time is about 5 days would be a decline of roughly 2% per day. This would lead to a total case count of 3783800. I assign this scenario a 30% likelihood. Rationales for each interval\n\u2022 3.5-4 million: This interval is possible in scenarios 2 and 3. I assign it likelihood of 50% consisting the likelihood of scenario 3 + 40% of the likelihood of scenario 2.\n\u2022 4-4.5 million: Possible for scenarios 1 and 2. I assign it a likelihood of 38% consisting 60% of the likelihood of scenario 2 and 40% of the likelihood of scenarios 1.\n\u2022 4.5 million +: Possible with scenario 1. I assign it a likelihood of 12% consisting 40% of the likelihood of scenario 1.\n\u2022 Less than 3 million: Practically impossible.\n\u2022 3-3.5 million: Requires a daily reduction in cases of at least 6% and so an R rate as low as 0.7 which is the lower bound of what it got to during the initial lockdown which was stricter and without the new variant.

However, only 50-60k confirmed cases are added per day at the current rate - which already seems to be declining, likely due to lockdown and secondarily vaccination rollout. Even with 24 additional days (the number of days until Feb 1st) of 50k cases per day, we would only just reach 3 million. As such, I believe \"fewer than 3 million\" and \"between 3,000,000 and 3,500,000\" to be the most likely candidates.

This is just short of the 3.096% increase I talked about below, which would have been 62,802 cases.  In order for this to resolve at less than 4,000,000 the average new cases per day would have to be 48,846.28 or less (4,000,000-2,778,843=1,221,157/25=48,846.28). Each day that goes by where the case numbers are over 48,846.28 will cause this number to decrease in order to still not go over 4,000,000. It appears that the case numbers are going up rapidly, and even though measures are put into place to slow this down, it will not start working for a few weeks. It is likely that it will get much worse over the next few weeks, or at a minimum get a bit worse. If case numbers are to go above 4,500,000, the case average would have to go up to 68,846.28 per day as of today (4,500,000-2,778,843=1,721,157/25 days=68,846.28). This seems more likely considering the large increase in cases over the last few days. However, this number will increase each day that goes by where the numbers are not at or over 68,846.28, as it will take more and more cases to make up the difference. For example, if tomorrow there is 62,500 new cases, the new daily average needed to get over 4,500,000 would be 69,110.708 (4,500,000-2,778,843-62,500=1,658,657/24 days=69,110.708) With that being said, this will very likely be in Bin 4 at a minimum, and potentially in Bin 5 by the end of the time period. Taking into account the potential exponential increase of spread due to the virulence of the new strain of COVID in the UK, I believe it is more likely that we will see an increase big enough in the next few weeks to reach the daily average needed to get into Bin 5 than we are to see it stay in Bin 4. The curve has just started going up, and lock down measures are unlikely to have any real effect for at least 2-3 weeks from when they are implemented.

Since 30 December (last 7 days according to the WHO numbers), there has been a daily average increase of 6.217% in case numbers. While this number is likely to go down over the next few days since the first few days had a huge increase, daily increases in the last five days are averaging at 3.096%, which if this holds steady would mean that the average daily cases needed to go over 4,500,000 by 1 February would be reached by the 11th.

This is so unlikely as to be worth discounting almost entirely (as reflected in the current crowd forecast). Based on the numbers provided  by @raciulo if things stay broadly the same, we're looking at 4,000,000 ish cases. If things get worse and the rate of infection increases more, maybe we'll hit 4,500,000, but it seems unlikely that the Government would not intervene if the cases per day started hitting 60,000 - 70,000.  Potential factors that might result in a slow in the spread: Lockdown: There is very much reason to believe that the UK will be locked down soon [1]. Matt Hancock himself has admitted that the Tiers approach hasn't worked [2]. If the UK goes into a full lockdown (including schools), it's hard to see this not slowing down the rate of infection. Because the virus hangs around for a while before showing symptoms, we're on a lag. Those people infected today will show symptoms in about a week's time. Lockdown would not reduce rates the same day. We might start seeing a positive change in a few weeks. The first two weeks of the November lockdown actually reported an increase in rates before a decline (possibly for this reason).  Vaccine: UK has begun rolling out the Oxford vaccine, but this is happening in very small numbers and is targeted at sections of the population that aren't really spreading the virus very much anyway (the elderly and sick). Furthermore, for the vaccine to be effective in an individual, they require 2 doses a month apart. Therefore, even those first vaccinated in December will not be fully vaccinated until this month. I expect it to be a while before we see positive change from the vaccination program. We only have half a million doses available this week. That's not really enough to make a dent.
