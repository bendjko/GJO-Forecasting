Additionally, Australian journalists are being held in China for reasons not released to the public. The TikTok app has also been topical and related to China. This tension could contribute to the Australian government mentioning China as the source however, there may be more of a restriction to specifically name the Chinese government. \nLifting the likelihood of any reports directly naming the China government was the recent change to Australia\u2019s extradition treaty with Hong Kong in response to fears over a new national security law imposed by China. The Chinese Government urged the Australian government to immediately stop involving themselves in these issues, with a threatening style quote deriving from the Chinese Embassy: \u201c\u2026otherwise it will lead to nothing but lifting a rock only to hit its own feet\".  \nBecause of the length of time since PM Morrison reported this to media (June 2020) and the growing tensions between China and Australia, there is an increased chance someone in the Australian Government will identify the Chinese Government as responsible for the attack. \nIn contrast, the clandestine nature in which ASD operate, and the number of escalating factors involved, there may be an increased level of caution in identifying the Chinese Government for fears of an ongoing feud and retribution (so the probability must be below 50%), however if there is significant evidence, Australia is unlikely to hold back. \nIt is likely Australia will only use estimative language in any accusations against the Chinese Government.

I think of many bets here as carry trades. When you bet with the crowd but slightly higher than the crowd, that's a carry trade.  In a tournament, it's wise to make plenty of carry trades. If you're playing for the long run, carry trades will likely result in a frustrating reversion to the mean.

(1) That gives a base rate of 8%. I have assumed that the outcome that Australian politicians will be considering for calling out china is trade sanctions. I have therefore adjusted my probability down to around 2% due to Australia's dependency on China for exporting.  I then added around 2% for the possibility of a minister accidentally naming China. This is based on the fact that in the 24 cases mentioned none of them accidentally named China, though Canada (1/24 = 4.17%) almost did. Therefore we get approx 2+2 = 4% There should be some scaling downwards of the probability for the amount of time left in the question, not sure how to go about doing this. It would make sense for countries to call out China closer to the cyber attacks in question, but the short time frame of the question could mean this effect is negligible. The fact that they haven't named China yet would suggest that they are less likely to, compared to the base rate which includes Belgium seemingly naming them very soon after major cyber attacks (2) Therefore adjusted somewhat arbitrarily down to 3% to reflect this.

This week, an industry panel advising the Australian government on cybersecurity urged it to adopt a more \u201cforward-leaning posture\u201d on naming the countries behind cyber-attacks \u2013 including working with close partners to jointly attribute responsibility. The Australian government declared last week its support for a joint cybersecurity advisory issued by the US, UK and China \u201cwhich details malicious cyber activity by Russian actors targeting organisations involved in Covid-19 vaccine development\u201d.

First, China seems to be launching her counterattack on Australia: according to the Global Times [1], Australia is intensifying her spionage over China. The news also _unironically_ shows a picture of the spy gear of someone caught in 2018, including funds, metro maps, a compass and gloves. It has also appeared on aussie media [2]. Besides that, apparently calling the cyber attacker by name is not necessarily an unseen tactic: the Germans have done it with the Russians [3]: \"The German Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed Moscow on May 28...\". From this I would not consider totally out of the question that Australia could decide to point the finger directly to China. Now @geo pointed out in a comment that a reason why Australia might not call it by name could be the prisoner's dilemma: as relationships with Canada and other countries are in a all time low, Australia might seek rapprochement to resume exports to China. This is a real possibility, as this has been an usual tactic by the Chinese diplomacy during the last twenty years or so. However it is also true that tensions are more serious than ever and that it can be considered that China is already at war with the West. For instance, if we read the book \"Unrestricted warfare\" [4] and review what China has been doing, then a really worrisome pattern emerges. From this point of view it would not be surprising that the most affected countries, in particular Australia which is a primary target of Chinese influence operations as they want to check whether they can break the lines of the Anglo-saxon countries, would began to be more aggressive towards China. Finally, there were rumors that the Chinese stopped many imports because they are short of foreign currency reserves (owing to less exports) but they still want to try to honor the phase one trade deal, because despite the rhetoric an intensification of the trade war with the US would be potentially negative at this moment. Thus they began by stopping a few non-essential AU imports and then after the new outbreak in Beijing they suggested that the virus came from imported food from Europe (these imports can now plunge without the need of a diplomatic brawl). However this is just a somewhat conspiranoid theory (except that with the Chinese government, conspiranoia is often a good analysis tool).

A few points: (1) The Australian gov wanted an investigation on the covid-19 origins [1,2], which of course is anathema to China.\n(2) Australia also wanted to have Taiwan in WHO [3], second no-go for China.\n(3) The \"totally independent\" Chinese media outlet the Global Times called Australia \"gum stuck to China's shoe\" [4]\n(4) China warned its citizens not to go to Australia, because racial violence [5]\n(5) China threatens economic boycott to Australia [6]\n(6) China suggests Australia to distance itself from the US [7] (we own you!)\n(7) Australia and India sign a deal to use each other military bases [8]\n(8) China's ban on Aussie beef and punitive tariffs on barley [9,10,11] This indicates that the Australia-China relationship has just become delightfully confrontational. Yet some of the movements by China are counterproductive to China's own interest, particularly the ones related to barley and beef. Now that the Chinese have suggested that the new outbreak in Beijing could be because of imports from Europe, they might need to be consistent with their own lies and reconsider imports from Australia. Or they might not, it's hard to tell. Yet there are a few factors that have not unfold yet: (a) the increase in confrontation between China and the US, which will lead to more tensions between Australia and China, (b) reactions to whatever happens in Hong-Kong, (c) whether China continues its current \"Wolf warrior diplomacy\" policy, which seems to be tailored to unite every western country (and many non-western ones) against China. However these increases in tension do not necessarily go on the direction of increasing the probability of some cabinet-level minister in Australia pointing out China by name. It could likely go into the other direction: not pointing out directly China as a way to reduce tensions on the thing that China values most: face.
