The democratic national convention was just pushed back to August 17th from July 13th hence the final option.  If Sanders really wants to compete for the election I can't see him dropping out in April or May. There are just two few important races scheduled due to the coronavirus. Wisconsin is in early April and Ohio is at the end and that's it. Even those elections may not occur. May also lacks any real races so it's unlikely he will drop out there. June 2nd looks like a huge day on the calendar now and I think that will be the key time if Sanders real tries to compete and win. I leave a bit in the last two in case caronavirus postpones June elections into July. Based on how the races went when it was just Biden Burnie it's hard to imagine him staying in if elections start occurring.  However, if Sanders just wants to shift Biden and/or the democratic party to the left, he could drop before any more races if convinced to do so. Hard to speculate what the chance of that is. I'll give it about 20%.
