Once that bill becomes law, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, would introduce separate legislation raising the debt limit. That is expected to pass with only Democratic votes in the 50-50 Senate, where Vice President Kamala Harris is empowered to break ties.\n\u201cDemocrats always said that we were willing to shoulder the load at 50 votes to get this done, as long as it wasn\u2019t a convoluted or risky process,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. \u201cLeader McConnell and I have achieved that.\u201d\"\n\"\u201cI\u2019m confident that this particular procedure, coupled with the avoidance of Medicare cuts, will achieve enough Republican support to clear the 60-vote threshold,\u201d Mr. McConnell said, predicting a Thursday vote for the bill in the Senate.\"\n\"Some Senate Republicans said they would be open to supporting the legislative gymnastics in the interest of foisting political responsibility for raising the limit onto Democrats.\n\u201cTo have Democrats raise the debt ceiling and be held politically accountable for racking up more debt is my goal, and this helps us accomplish that,\u201d Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, told reporters before the lunch.\"\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/07/us/politics/debt-ceiling-deal-congress.html\nIt's ironic, but good that Republicans don't want to cut Medicare right now.

Not the way I saw it happening but I guess the fundamental premise (that Dems currently have the legislative and temporal CAPABILITY and OPPORTUNITY for any form of filibuster change and that Republican obstructionism to literally everything would eventually force the collective will of the Dems to find its spine) remains sound? Doubt remaining (35%) lies in the intractable nature of the two moderate Dem senators and their well baked in positions on filibuster changes (with a reputational off ramp for this specific issue as an \"impending national crisis\") and the remaining time left for this question which, without the debt ceiling issue (that I personally believe McConnell will find a graceful way to cave on at the last) becomes a real constraint on the probability of this questions \"yes\" resolution.

When wondering why the GOP is choosing to employ a \"total obstructionist\" strategy to every meaningful vote (including this latest clown show [1] that may initiate another government shutdown, historically not a winning strategy for the obstructionist side [2]) ) I'm also reminded of Hanlon's Razor: \"Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity\".  It feels entirely possible that the GOP is so fundamentally wed to the self-implosive force that is No. 45 that this is driven by a Mar-a-Lago edict and out of fear of reputational retribution. I still believe McConnell is more intelligent and strategic than this but is he really in charge anymore?  What are the GOP's money men wanting from their bought and paid for Senators and how does this advance their interests?  Not sure. All this said, this vote and the other issues coming up over the next month seem to push the need for some kind of carve out to be more and more necessary for the Dems, Biden and the Country.  This building pressure (and unrelenting obstructionism on the GOP side)  may in turn give Manchin the political and moral spine he needs to agree to vote for it 9with only  limited impact on his W.V polling), which in turn feels likely to see Sinema fold as someone who will not want to be the lone voice of dissent in such situations.

Is it fair to say that the majority of voters who really care about the filibusters maintenance at this moment currently sit on the other side of the widening political divide?  If West Virginia and/or Arizona can be offered something shiny for their Senator's resistance to, but eventual agreement with, a filibuster carve out are they still likely to punish them at ballot boxes (Manchin re-election in 2024, Sinema re-election in 2025 and most voters have short memories). Whilst their resistance is vocal and consistent the other side are doing everything they can (potentially deliberately - Dems beware) to give Manchin and Sinema [2] an excuse to vote with a filibuster carve out in order to bring in a major legislative priority (Infra, voting rights etc.).

Sources familiar with the compromise bill say it will focus on shoring up voting rights against GOP suppression laws, crack down on dark money and partisan gerrymandering, and create new policies to stop attempts at election subversion like what happened after the 2020 presidential election. But even if the revised bill earns the support of all Democrats, it won\u2019t be enough to overcome the filibuster.

John Sarbanes says. \u201cThey appreciate that the electorate that showed up for Joe Biden in 2020 now wants to see Joe Biden show up for them in 2021.\u201d When it comes to the filibuster, the Biden administration\u2019s position hasn\u2019t always been clear. In early March, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Biden didn\u2019t support any changes to the filibuster. A few weeks later, Biden told ABC News that he supported bringing back the so-called talking filibuster, forcing any senator who wanted to block a vote to stand and speak on the Senate floor. A few months after that, Psaki declined to say whether Biden backed creating a carve-out to the filibuster for legislation related to voting rights while also distancing the White House from any potential negotiations about filibuster reform. \u201cThe filibuster is a legislative process tool, an important one, that warrants debate,\u201d she said, \u201cbut determination about making changes will be made by members of the Senate, not by this president or any president, frankly, moving forward.\u201d Winning over the two Democrats who\u2019ve declared their opposition to filibuster reform, Sens. Manchin and Sinema, won\u2019t be easy. . . .\nYet Sinema has broadly endorsed the need for voting-rights reforms, and Manchin says \u201cinaction is not an option.\u201d Congressional aides and anti-corruption activists who support the For the People Act say Schumer\u2019s strategy has been to give Republicans every opportunity to work with Democrats on a compromise bill, and to allow Manchin the space to lead those negotiations, if only to show that Republicans won\u2019t support any version of pro-democracy reform that Democrats come up with. \u201cWe continue to see that the Republicans are not willing to negotiate in good faith on these fundamental issues to protect our democracy,\u201d says Tiffany Muller of End Citizens United. A spokesman for End Citizens United says the group is spending $30 million this year to get the For the People Act onto Biden\u2019s desk, most of that on more than 130 paid ads on TV, digital, and mail. But at this point in the campaign, it\u2019s entirely up to Biden and Senate Democrats to muster the support for filibuster reform and passing a new version of the bill. Fred Wertheimer of Democracy 21 says the For the People Act would be the most ambitious law to uphold voting rights and fight corruption since the slew of post-Watergate reforms in the 1970s. Wertheimer says he expects Biden to do everything he can to make those reforms a reality, but ultimately the decision rests with the 50 Democratic senators. \u201cThis is a moment when members of the Senate are going to wind up on the right side or wrong side of history,\u201d Wertheimer says. \u201cThe stakes for our democracy are enormous.\u201d\n~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  The first problem is getting 50 votes for a rules change (and 50 votes for the legislation being considered):  Ie. getting Manchin & Sinema on board.

Joe Biden has overnight been knocked onto the back foot with a poorly thought out, poorly executed (and even more poorly forecasted) departure from America's longest war.

Voting Rights (both as a distraction and as a counter to current Republican momentum at state level) might be seen as just the thing he needs to change the narrative (especially seeing as Infra may prove more internally divisive amongst moderates and progressives than leadership would have hoped / wished) but Biden and the Dems will probably need to do something fairly quickly (i.e. immediately on congress' return) in order to get people talking about something else and get something through in a meaningful timeframe [1]. Seeing as voting rights looks likely to be the hill that both sides will die on from their respective trenches (for existential reasons described previously) this issue logically remains the one most likely to bring the \"scope of the filibuster\" question to a head and potentially cause an adjustment (with a total removal of the filibuster seeming to be a far more remote possibility at this moment, especially given its recent symbolic use by Democrats in the Texas Senate! [2]). As such I'm willing to shift possibility up slightly and into the realm of \"ever so slightly more than a 50/50 coin toss\" (with all the previously described conditions and blockers still in place).

Politicians are malleable and fickle creatures: open to temptation, pressure, incentive and threats.  All are in play for this, but the \"capability\" and \"opportunity\" for a change in filibuster rules is in the hands of the ruling party at this moment [2].  The final \"will\" corner of the human action triangle is one of the hardest to measure, but with pressure on this issue increasing daily and at a significant rate ([3], [4] and [5]) it seems entirely feasible (with plenty of 2021 left) for filibuster reform to happen before years end as a precursor to pushing forwards on Voting Rights resolution and implementation across all states (which will take time and therefore should also be factored in). Not sure about the political tactics on this and when, from a strategy point of view, would be the best time to put in voting rights (and therefore when filibuster reform would need to happen to allow it).  Safe to assume that 2022 mid terms will be the hard deck for this, and I can see endless challenges from Rep state houses being pushed up to the SC on this if the voting rights bills were to pass.  Time for states to implement the bill's requirements must also be factored in to the \"when\" question. What I don't know is if Dems would feel it better to get those dealt with well before the mid terms (leaving a clear path to the voting booths and no further means for Republican state houses to interfere) or whether it would be more tactically sensible to leave it to right before the mid terms (presumably hoping that the SC would not be able to make a ruling fast enough to block the bill from being enacted by the mid terms). I also don't know if a legal challenge on its way to the SC would park the voting rights bills whilst it was being considered or if they would remain in place as the legal precedent until an SC ruling was given. Any help from anyone more in the know about the specific legal challenge process, and therefore the most likely tactical play, would be greatly appreciated!  At the moment all I have to go on is the endless SC challenges raised against the ACA (which don't seem to have stopped its implementation or function, which suggests that implementing the rules later and closer to 2022 would be better for Dems?).

The Democrats in the Senate passed three CRA resolutions in the past four months. . . .  The Congressional Review Act was passed in 1996 as part of the Contract with America. It requires executive branch agencies to submit regulations to Congress and allows the legislative branch to pass resolutions repealing those regulations. Congress has 60 session days to pass such a resolution which is exempted from the normal rules of debate. Most significantly, such resolutions are not subject to filibusters in the Senate. . . . The CRA is largely only useful for Congress at the beginning of a presidential administration that differs in party than its predecessor because the president can veto resolutions of disapproval and will do so to protect his own regulatory initiatives. . . .  the Trump administration issued hundreds of regulations in its waning days. Many of these were of a nature likely to be opposed by a Democratic Congress including regulations to deregulate environmental protections, make it easy to repeal regulations at the Department of Health and Human Services, and numerous others. With such a target-rich environment, and unencumbered by the filibuster, one would think that the Democratic Senate would have passed a large number of repeals. But they only used the CRA three times. The limited action by Congress to use the CRA shows that simply getting rid of the filibuster will not have the dramatic impacts that advocates hope for and opponents fear. It is true that there are some aspects peculiar to the CRA that may explain why Democrats were reluctant to use it. The CRA contains a provision that prevents issuance of substantively similar regulations in the future, and some progressives have voiced the fear that this provision would prevent any regulation in the policy area covered by the regulation being overturned. Others, though, have convincingly argued that this is not the case.  Some progressives have also argued that using the CRA, which has until this year been used in a solely deregulatory manner, gives legitimacy and bipartisan support to a statute they would like to see repealed. However, this is an argument for not using the statute at all. Once it has been used by Democrats, the marginal impact of using it additional times is zero. So, the question remains: Why only three uses of this potentially powerful tool? At the end of the day, the most likely explanation is that even with the filibuster removed, legislating in the Senate is not easy. This is particularly true when the Senate is as closely divided as it is currently with 50 Republicans and 50 Democrats. Debate in the Senate is slower than in the House; the Senate has to spend time on confirmations (something not true for the House), and the majority has to hold on to every member in order to win a partisan vote. Democrats have been debating the removal of the filibuster for all legislation since they assumed control of the Senate in January. Progressives have argued that removing the filibuster would allow the passage of a raft of legislation implementing their priorities. Republicans have voiced fear about the same outcome. But the experience with the CRA highlights the possibility that both the hopes and fears associated with ending the filibuster may be overstated. The same factors that limited the passage of CRA resolutions will still be in play for normal legislation in a post-filibuster world. This means that the majority party (for now the Democrats) will still have to carefully prioritize legislative bills and confirmations and will still need to make sure they can get a majority of votes. Eliminating the filibuster will doubtlessly help the Democrats enact some of their priorities. But as the experience with the CRA shows, the policy impact of doing so is likely to fall far short of expectations on both sides of the aisle.\n~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  I think that the last sentence sums up the situation:  \". . . as the experience with the CRA shows, the policy impact of doing so [eliminating the filibuster] is likely to fall far short of expectations on both sides of the aisle\" and that is why I think it isn't going to happen."], [13657, "2021-06-26T02:08:23Z", [0.01], ""], [61598, "2021-06-25T20:50:59Z", [0.03], ""], [56, "2021-06-24T01:07:01Z", [0.0], "AKA, the votes aren't there.

Rep obstruction is in no way a surprise and confirms the premise that this is an existential issue for both sides (as it defines the power play for the mid terms and the next presidential election cycle). Is this instructive for this question and the filibuster?  Not entirely, but it shows flexibility and a baseline of voting intent / principle that opens the door [2]. The WSJ's position on this issue [3] shouldn't be a surprise to anyone given the built in protections against \"dark money\" political funding that Manchin appears to support (and has now signalled a willingness to entertain in his voting trend).  I would guess that a lot of WSJ readers will be terrified of suddenly loosing their pet representatives and senators (or have their \"puppet and master\" relationships revealed) if this were to go through. With Manchin's willingness to shift on the principle (and with the Dems meeting him and some of the more reasonable Rep positions regarding voter ID requirements) I assess the door to be open for some form of Filibuster scope adjustment, given that the \"talking filibuster\" and a change in cloture requirements still won't move the functional needle on the critical Voter Rights issue in the necessary timeframe (i.e. well before the 2022 election season). All States will need time to implement new requirements of this bill, Red States will want to kick off every kind of Court challenge available against (as they will scream and holler) \"Federal overreach\", money will need to be found to implement.  The Court challenge timings should be accounted for in working back from the mid terms to figure out when the Dems (the driving player here) need to have this bill in place to have the desired effect.  Not sure if this bill's progress will be able to reverse any damage Reps can do with their control of redistricting or whether changes can be reversed in time for mid terms, but worth factoring in also to work out what the time imperatives are. Actions speak louder (and more honestly) than words, so if you want to predict the future in politics don't listen to what they say, watch what they do (and how they vote). Dems and their existential need to get voting rights passed to have any chance in 2022 mid terms clearly gives them a significant degree of \"the will\" to act on this question.  Tempered and more strategic minds will be thinking about what a filibuster adjustment might open them up to if/when McConnell retakes the chair, but recent SC decisions on the Reps \"one big idea\" of Obamacare repeal  [4] seems to indicate that getting something into law gives it a degree of \"repeal proofing\" amongst even the heavily Conservative leaning SC (and, interestingly, Trumps more controversial appointees).  There may be other tricks Dems can put in to mitigate damage of changing the Filibuster to limit exposure with flipped control that I'm not aware of and that will settle the \"will\" of those arguing, sensibly, to think about the long term impact of changes to filibuster rules. Their current (fragile) control of Senate and House gives them theoretical \"capability\" to make the changes to the Filibuster that fall within scope. The question now is whether the timings (August recess, procedural time frames etc.) leave the \"opportunity\" within this questions period to get it done.  It's only June, and a lot can happen in six months when the leader of the house and senate are willing to get such things heard on the legislature's floor. Does anyone here have any insight into whether it would be more strategically sensible for Dems to get voting rights in closer to the 2022 mid terms, or if it is strategically foolish to do it this early? e.g. is it better or worse for the Dems to allow for time for the expected Court challenges from Red States to go all the way up to the SC?  Would Court challenges place a hold on the bill's enactment (in which case better to get it over with early to prevent slow walking into 2022 mid terms)?  Or would Court challenges not prevent the bill's impact being felt in 2022 mid terms (in which case it might be better for Dems to go slow now and land the bill as close to the 2022 mid terms as logistics allows)? Inherently I'm working on the former assumption at this moment, but a view from someone more in the know would be greatly appreciated!

On the other hand, reconciliation was never going to work for some of the civil liberties issues anyway and these seem to be the ones that are most likely to force the Dems hands on \"poking a hole\" (or two: Washington and Puerto Rico statehood?) in the filibuster to allow them through. I don't actually believe the Dems (the sensible ones anyway) honestly want to do away with the filibuster entirely given the open season it will give to Republicans when they inevitably rise again from the muck they are currently rolling around in.  They'll want to maintain some degree of blocking power themselves in the future (exactly as Manchin and Sinema are warning about), so they'll want to choose their moment and build their case for filibuster de-fanging on their biggest ticket issues (voting rights and legislative control) once they have built up a solid evidence bank of GOP obstructionism on some of the more \"sacrificial\" bills Schumer will be presenting in June. https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/schumer-sets-june-vote-elections-overhaul-bill-77968902 Worth watching therefore the playlist of bills Schumer brings and the order he brings them in.

Anything else sees him taking a stand on an issue that seems likely to place him firmly on the wrong side of history, and Manchin seems to enjoy fettling a legacy he wants to be proud of. https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/news/joe-manchin-deeply-disappointed-gop-003700504.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAInGpmjoJ14ZD291N7Njp25kysHYkjfRvF5Z7yoPJHtE4Q9IDUtumIapCtHzCbImXperoyCImS3mLjnt-CUJAyT24h9LOldviljE01vsxoT9z_fmdCD5O0JhsS9JvH4tMPVRHiJeU1quUEG4J8jUVx1Ww_DJ-XJXvcTPEbH00LDO\n[2]  https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/biden-prioritizes-us-voting-rights-law-as-restrictions-mount-joe-biden-tulsa-democrats-john-lewis-congress-b1857967.html"], [90167, "2021-06-01T23:33:22Z", [0.04], ""], [28899, "2021-06-01T06:42:47Z", [0.04], ""], [88614, "2021-05-31T15:34:37Z", [0.05], ""], [484, "2021-05-30T03:03:48Z", [0.15], "Down 5% for passage of time. 46 may charter a bipartisan Jan 6 panel and there are signs of some token infrastructure compromise.

With this fight starting in May 21 (leaving 7 months to resolve it one way or the other) I'm happy to adjust a little upwards for the time available. Still feels a little more likely at this stage that this may come to a head in early 2022 (or not at all), and there are significant road blocks and hurdles to cross to get to the stage where the filibuster gets it teeth filed a little (in a specific, limited and targeted way to mollify the Manchins & Sinemas in the Dem caucus), but by letting it run that long the Dems risk handing the Republicans a voter animating issue that could be used to improve their turnout in what will be described by them as \"a do or die\" mid terms. The sooner the Dems can get over the internal divisions (and quicker than the Republican's own travails), give Republicans some bounded space to come to the table and talk in good faith (before giving up and pushing ahead anyway with the high probability that McConnell will keep playing the only hand he knows) and then get this to a vote (with a means to ignore the other side's obstruction if they remain determinedly entrenched) the sooner they can get the kinks worked out, funds allocated & spent and the mid terms per-work tidied up in those states most heavily afflicted by State Republican voter suppression.  Without this in place the mid terms may flip control and effectively ring the funeral bell for any more legislative progress in Biden's first (and potentially last) presidential term. This in turn might well disenchant Dem voters in the next presidential elections and that plus sweeping voter suppression in Republican held state houses, could easily see a return to what America has just put behind it.  This timeline will undoubtedly be in the minds of Dems strategists and will also be in the minds of Dem obstructionists who will be wondering how their behaviour may be written into their legacy. Time is a key factor in this to work out when the filibuster (and its revision) might become the pivotal issue for Dems to resolve (and the time needed to do whatever comes after a filibuster amendment is in place).  2021 still seems to be on the cards but I'd defer to a procedural expert to get a more accurate assessment of exactly when the voting rights bill would nee to be in place to have any manifest restorative impact on the 2022 mid terms."], [88614, "2021-05-10T17:59:55Z", [0.08], ""], [31275, "2021-05-09T16:48:31Z", [0.04], ""], [88452, "2021-05-09T10:25:10Z", [0.26], ""], [2965, "2021-05-09T03:59:48Z", [0.75], ""], [19127, "2021-05-07T15:33:11Z", [0.14], ""], [38, "2021-05-05T20:04:39Z", [0.02], "https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-nightly/2021/05/03/the-filibuster-isnt-stopping-senate-dems-492702 \". . .  \u201ctask one\u201d is finding a path to get all 50 Democratic caucus members on board. \u201cTask two, go out and see if there\u2019s any path towards ending the filibuster over this.\u201d On issue after issue, the Senate is still stuck on task one.\n. . . \n\"There is a noticeable gap between the aspirations of filibuster critics and reality: If and when Schumer tries to quash decades of precedent governing the 60-vote threshold, he\u2019ll do it for high-profile legislation where he\u2019s confident he can win 50 votes (with Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 tie-breaking vote ready to go).

A lot of \"faith\" in forecasting on this question seems to be founded on the spinal integrity of a long in the tooth, realpolitik experienced and demonstrably canny politician and his stalwart adherence to his \"principles\" of bi-partisanship and Senate integrity (!!). I'm too much of a cynic in today's environment to believe that Washington actually works that way (or arguably ever did), and Manchin in particular has never shone through as someone who seems willing to sacrifice all (his seat, his standing and his legacy) on a point of deep seated moral conviction [1]. Whatever he might wish of comity and bi-partisanship in his chamber, the GOP are not his friend and if they think they can oust him for one of their own they will (and almost did in 2018).  Playing to their (increasingly insane) side in the hopes of \"mercy\" from the right wing propaganda machine seems an eminently na\u00efve and foolish stance to take. Whilst he holds power and podium over Senate bills right now he's also going to need friends and backing in the near future to hold off the mounting GOP challenges (and I'm sure he knows it). If he over plays his hand and pushes back too hard on things the President and his own side view as \"must haves\" (voting rights being a big one) he may suddenly find himself a very lonely player at a time and a political environment when \"picking a side\" has become a survival necessity. Sinema likewise. It seems equally (if not more) likely that Manchin in particular is holding this \"principled line\" in order to maximise the bargaining power and leverage he holds over his own party and the presidency with his uniquely powerful position in the razor's edge balanced senate at this moment. Getting this particular leopard to \"change his spots\" may simply be a matter of making him (and/or his state) a sufficiently interesting offer in behind the scenes negotiations. Its entirely possible I'm wrong and that, with his record of success in his state standing sufficiently separated and distinct from that of his own Party [2], he feels this is a hill worth fighting on (at least until after 2021). But with the long storied and \"baked in\" realpolitik behaviours of Washington denizens like Manchin, and with the power he currently holds to get real, practical and visible things his own state will love him for (far more than standing on some archaic procedural principle) I'm not convinced I'd want to bet too big on it. On the question of time: there are some big and highly impactful bills coming up in the next 3 - 6 months (even beyond Infra which looks highly likely to move through reconciliation) that will potentially set Dems up for better mid terms BUT may also become big, animating issues for the GOP voter base if allowed to fester into 2022 (when they can be turned into \"we need to block this or else!!\" voting incentives that have historically played well for the right). As such, whilst politics is politics, it seems as a strategic point that the Dems will want to bring these bills to a head in 2021 in time to buoy up their base and get these major bills locked in before they become talking points or are lost forever in the event of a bad mid terms.  As such, Manchin being allowed to kick these issues down the road into 2022 feels like a major gamble at best (with these issues being used by Dems to encourage their voters to the polling stations) or a major (and potentially terminal) strategic misplay at worst. Given this I can easily see a path to the issue of the filibuster coming to a head sooner rather than later.

But I'm keeping my eye on HR1/S1 and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement bill. Manchin has definitely signaled that he favors picking apart S1 and trying to encourage GOP to support one or two elements within it (e.g., early voting, the Native American Voting Rights Act, election security and/or transparency in campaign finance). But if (as I suspect) there are not 10 GOP Senators who can get on board any of those provisions, then I can envision Manchin making a \"heroic\" decision to add \"voting rights\" to the category of items that should not be subject to a filibuster. Even that decision, however, carries with it the risk that Republicans, if they gain a majority, could use the precedent to ram voter suppression laws thru in the name of combating \"voter fraud.\" Very tricky calculations that will depend in part on polling estimates (themselves not all that reliable) about the fate of the Dem majority in either/both chambers later this year.

More importantly, no Democrat wants to be the one who made McConnell smile. These appear to be the cold hard realities of a filibuster that is allowed to hold back the HR1 and HR4 bills and, as the Vox article points out, the traditional talking filibuster could easily be gamed by Republicans to keep the upcoming voting rights reforms firmly behind procedural bars.  What I don't know is if limitations placed upon the talking filibuster (e.g. only the senator raising the objection can hold the floor : no tag teams) would fall within bounds of this question.  I would think not given that such a change would affect HOW the filibuster could (and could not) be used but not by itself have an effect on WHEN it could be used (i.e. the  scope, as per the question's apparent bounds). Over the forecasted period (and potentially not all at once) I see the most likely changes here being a combination: a very narrow and targeted (but still relevant for this question) limitation placed on filibuster (probably specifically to constrain its use in voter reform legislation) to sooth the concerns of Democrat dissenters combined with a far more public and \"noisy\" requirement for talking filibusters and a permanent senator presence (turning filibuster blocking manoeuvres into a petty pageantry exercise for that will be designed to play out badly in the public eye). Whether it works or not is the remaining 33% of the question I'm leaving open, but at this stage it seems an inevitability that this question will come to a head imminently and with some significant public pressure and media interest in the results.

Not entirely sure what they hope to achieve with this or what the long term strategy is, but their decision to do this will likely act as a hardener of views regarding the realistic near term potential for bi-partisanship and a parallel warming to the idea of filibuster reform (if not outright abolition) from even the more conservative end of the Democratic caucus [2]. I found this article in the NY Intelligencer a very useful perspective on this question and the impact / approaches that Manchin and Sinema may require to get some of the more impactful (and time critical) legislation through [2].  It feels important to note that, for all the \"red democrat\" hard line statements being made by the Manchins and Sinemas of the Democratic caucus, the (adjusted) COVID relief bill seems very likely to pass with their votes [3] which shows a degree of flexibility in thinking and willingness to fall in line when the weight of public opinion (at both national and state levels) is behind it. With Republicans playing silly buggers and going all in at the flop, Manchin and Sinema may find it easier to countenance a filibuster adjustment using Republican intransigence as the justification for a \"change / softening of heart\". Its also worth remembering that, with a strategic eye on the long game, a de-fanging of the filibuster may be exactly what McConnel wants the Dems to do to give greater unilateral power to a slowly waning Republican majority if and when they come to power again (all eyes on 2022).

Not conclusive at this point, but with the imperative for \"big reforms\" heavily in play and with the filibuster being identified across all media spectrums as the most significant blocker to such policy moves it seems likely that the pressure is growing (and that manoeuvring is happening to build it further). Democrats have full control to decide what policy votes to bring to the senate and so to keep the fires lit underneath their opponents feet it seems very likely they'll keep bringing up votes that Republicans will reliably / have no choice but to vote \"no\" to en-masse (hesitate to say \"on principle\" given the lack of evidence such a thing exists within todays GOP). This \"two birds, one stone\" approach keeps the Republicans (very publicly) looking miserly, out of touch and flagrantly hypocritical (note the red state heavy map where the $15 wage hike will have the most positive impact on the most people [4]) whilst also helping build the case for the neutering of the filibuster a little further down the road.

Even with the most obvious and easily swallowed case being brought to bear (and a golden opportunity for GOP stalwarts to reject Trumpism and show the US voting block a reformed face) the majority Republican party could not muster whatever it needed to turn away from their current course and start to ween themselves off their newly found voter base (which many sage political strategists say would now be political suicide from a power & influence perspective [1 & 2]: so understandable if still hypocritical, morally egregious, myopically short term and potentially terminal in the long run). The message being sent here seems to be to expect more of the same from McConnell and his caucus.  Political gamesmanship, Washington focused power plays, pedantic manoeuvring and a rejection of bi-partisanship on principle (and despite anything that resembles principles for the post Trump GOP). The difference here is that Democrats now possess many of the levers to work around this to progress their agenda (but only guaranteed for the next two years) and one of the most notable is adjustments to (or abolition of) the filibuster.  The question of whether they will have the gumption to use them is interesting, but they are now facing the same animated voter push to act effectively as the Republicans are to blocking action.  It also seems likely they'll still be sore from the memories of attempted bi-partisanship and faithless GOP negotiations in the Obama years. As such, adjustments to the scope of the filibuster seem to be both a significant possibility within the next two years and even a functional necessity for certain agenda items [3 & 4], many of which will in turn boost Democrat chances in the 2022 election season (adding even greater necessity to the weakened filibuster in 2021): The \"For The People\" Act: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_the_People_Act\nJohn Lewis Voting Rights Act: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lewis_Voting_Rights_Act I note this questions carefully described boundaries: focusing on adjustments to the scope of the filibuster (and not just its abolition in totality).  Adjustments and amendments to the filibuster could be spun and bounded to become far more politically palatable to the more conservative / originalist Democrats (Manchin and Sinema keep getting name checked): a key hurdle to cross for this question to resolve in the positive. Doubtful we'll see much movement on this before Q3/4 2021 with other priorities taking front row and the need for Democrats to let the Republicans build the justification for filibuster adjustment (encouraging/forcing Manchin and Sinema's hands) through obstructionism and shenanigans over the next six months.  That said, the tempo & initiative for this seems to be entirely within the Democrats control, so whilst (at this moment) less than a 50% I don't think its anywhere near as unlikely as the crowd seem to believe. To gain an alternate perspective on political questions like this (dragonfly eye), I've used an old Security / Defence risk management mantra that has proved particularly useful for \"high impact / low (starting) credibility\" political events that \"feel\" inherently unprecedented / unexpected / unlikley in nature: \"A manmade / person driven event needs three things to be present to come to pass: 1.  The Will / Intent.\n2.  The Capability / Capacity / Leverage.\n3.  The Opportunity.\" The Dems appear (until 2022) to have both inherent \"Capability\" and open \"Opportunity\".  The only thing currently holding them back appears to be the \"Will\".  The question to ask for this question, therefore, seems to be \"what events,  behaviours, pressures & incentives will give them the will and determination to take the action?\".

Republicans will certainly filibuster because it impedes a state's ability to conduct its own elections however democrats have very strong feelings on the passage of this bill and Obama has said they should revoke the fillibuster to make it pass.

BUT (and its a BIG but): there's the obvious dark cloud of the 2022 mid terms on the horizon and the short two years between then and now to consider.  Mid terms are generally bad for incumbent parties and look to be doubly so in 2022 given the Republicans control of state houses, their power over redistricting ([1 and 2]) and the near certainty of gerrymandering wherever and however they can. With no obvious alternative way to make DC & Puerto Rico states (to swing the numbers in their favour) or pass the \"Government reform bill\" (a bill that would bring in anti-gerrymandering measures to spoke the GOPs statehood control advantage [3]) then adjusting the filibuster later in 2021 or at the start of 2022 (with COVID relief and vaccinations bearing a wave of good will to work off) may be the only way Dems can hold on beyond a short two years.  It appears redistricting kicks in early - mid 2021 (delays from COVID may push census data from March 2021 to July 2021 [4]) and must be complete before the filing deadlines in 2022 [5], so the perceived urgency for Dems to adjust filibuster rules in 2021 to get some form of \"Government Reform Bill\" in place seems even more relevant to this question [6]. Given the increasingly \"total war\" style behaviours in US politics over the last decade, and with little real sign of more civil governance and bi-partisan cooperation on the horizon, the Dems may feel there is no other way to keep control over Biden's term.  Given their (slim but absolute) control of the trifecta in these first two years, with the painful memories of Obamas second half still fresh in their minds and with the high likelihood of legal challenges being raised by Republicans to run out the clock on anything like this, a 2021 move to add further limits to the filibuster (possibly temporarily and only until the end of Biden's first term?) seems eminently possible and even strategically sensible. If the above posit is valid and accurate, it will depend on whether they can get their full caucus to sign up to it (Manchin and Sinema are apparently the ones to watch).  Currently no noise or indications from any of the more conservative Democrats, but then again given the touchy subject matter it doesn't seem likely we'll hear about it in public until its right on the Capitol's doorstep.

That is no longer true. The death of Ruth Bader Ginsberg means that updates to the Judiciary Act to increase the number of associate justices on the Supreme Court replaces the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act or rejoining the JCPOA as the most likely vote that results in a weaker filibuster.

Adam Jentleson, who was deputy chief of staff to former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and is the author of a forthcoming history of the Senate, \u201cKill Switch,\u201d said that even if conservative Democrats say they will block the party from removing the filibuster, they could well change their minds if circumstances suit them. \u201cCount me skeptical in general of even the most seemingly firm statements of opposition,\u201d he told Yahoo News. \u201cThings change.\u201d Jentleson said the debate on \u201cgoing nuclear,\u201d a term used for blowing up the filibuster, has evolved in recent months. \u201cWhat\u2019s becoming increasingly clear is that in the polarized country we have, going nuclear isn\u2019t necessary to pass far-left priorities; it\u2019s necessary to pass middle-of-the-road priorities and really for the Senate to function at all,\u201d Jentleson said. He concurred that the filibuster has been repeatedly used to block civil rights legislation from slavery through the Jim Crow era, casting Obama\u2019s decision to make the proposal while eulogizing a civil rights hero as significant. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason [the filibuster] has been birthed into existence and honed over the years when reactionary white conservatives have found themselves outnumbered and wanting to defy the march of progress and the will of the majority,\u201d Jentleson said. \u201cThe net effect today is still to empower a minority of reactionary white conservatives to impose their will on the rest of the country without having to secure a majority of the vote or win the battle of public opinion. And that\u2019s part of why it\u2019s so dangerous in a democracy because the agenda of our government doesn\u2019t reflect the will of a majority. It reflects the will of a minority that\u2019s dramatically out of step with the rest of the country, and that\u2019s not a healthy dynamic.\u201d\n~~~~~~ https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2020/08/24/democrats-might-regret-killing-the-filibuster/#slide-1 \"The nuclear option would change Congress for the worse . . .  There are reasons for objective observers to throw cold water on these hopes. While Democrats certainly have a path to a Senate majority, much will doubtless change between now and November. Even if the Democrats manage to win a Senate majority, it proably will not be large enough to overhaul the body\u2019s rules to the liking of the Left.  Nonetheless, pressure is building in Democratic circles to eliminate the filibuster once and for all. According to reporting in The Hill, Oregon senator Jeff Merkley, one of the chamber\u2019s most outspoken liberals, is circulating \u201cnuclear option\u201d proposals to end the already attenuated filibuster. Delaware senator Chris Coons, who frequently masquerades as a moderate, made clear his support for abolishing the procedure should it prove a barrier to a hypothetical Biden agenda. When Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, cautioned against filibuster reform, MSNBC host Rachel Maddow responded with a tweet reading, simply, \u201cLOLOLOL.\u201d This marks a shift from a year ago, when Senate Democrats were more divided on the question. At that point, Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, was pushing for eliminating the filibuster as part of her misbegotten presidential campaign. Under pressure, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, of New York, said in July that nothing was \u201coff the table\u201d when it came to the filibuster, and Dick Durbin, of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, made similar noises.  Yet at that point, numerous other Democrats seemed reluctant, including Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris, neither of whom could be described as a \u201cmoderate.\u201d Virginia\u2019s Tim Kaine, who like Coons has mastered the art of getting the D.C. press corps to call him a \u201cmoderate\u201d for little discernible reason, also expressed concern. Now the ranks of reluctant Democrats seem to be shrinking. Many of those mentioned above are changing their tune or avoiding the question, leaving a smaller cadre of liberal senators expressing skepticism about the nuclear option. Angus King, of Maine, an independent-in-name-only, has expressed discomfort with the move. Dianne Feinstein, of California, certainly no moderate, has also said that she believes the legislative filibuster serves the Senate well. Joe Manchin, of West Virginia, whose overwhelmingly conservative voters would no doubt object to greasing the skids for liberal legislation, says he opposes the nuclear option in no uncertain terms. According to a Politico profile from late last year, Arizona\u2019s Kyrsten Sinema likewise opposes the move. If these four continue to hold out, Democrats will need to do much better than expected in this fall\u2019s Senate races to have the numbers required to kill the filibuster once and for all.  Why the reluctance? . . .   Beyond this obvious turnabout-is-fair-play scenario, the nuclear option\u2019s other, longer-term political effects should give Democrats pause.  First, a major procedural change would create immense uncertainty for Democratic incumbents. In my conversations with current and former Senate GOP staffers, I find near unanimity in predicting one outcome: In the short term, the nuclear option would create chaos. The Senate would immediately come to look a lot more like the House, where the speaker rules with an iron fist. In a purely majoritarian Senate, the majority leader becomes the gatekeeper for lawmaking. Anything that reaches the floor of the Senate would presumably become law with relatively little deliberation, as the need to build consensus went out the window. At least in the short term, this would likely make lawmaking even more polarized than it already is.  To put this in concrete terms: Chuck Schumer, newly empowered, would have to navigate treacherous political waters with a deftness he has not, to date, shown. Likewise, individual senators would face countervailing political pressures, pressures that would pit their general-election prospects squarely against the priorities of the partisans in their primary electorates.  As the political scientist David Mayhew notes in his book Partisan Balance, the filibuster functions as a kind of \u201cintensity net\u201d that scuppers legislation that the majority may support mildly but that roughly a third of the chamber opposes fiercely. Senators can play both sides of this net. If a bill beloved by the base will certainly fail, they can vote for it without worrying about paying in the general election for its material consequences. Conversely, a bill doomed to failure can be an opportunity to burnish one\u2019s bipartisan credentials by crossing the aisle without the consequence of passing policy. Manchin is the master of this strategy, always there for a bipartisan vote when it no longer matters.  Senators would lose the ability to use the filibuster to take conspicuous albeit doomed stands on major issues. While the \u201ctalking filibuster\u201d has become a comparatively small part of the chamber\u2019s daily life, it is still on the books. Any senator can hold up the business of the world\u2019s greatest deliberative body so long as he or she can keep standing and talking without rest. A decade ago, Bernie Sanders raised his national profile considerably by speaking for nine hours against a bipartisan tax deal. Three years later, Rand Paul, of Kentucky, filibustered the nomination of John Brennan to be CIA director, to raise concern about America\u2019s drone program. (Paul\u2019s filibuster would be impossible today thanks to Reid\u2019s decision later that year to go nuclear on almost all nominations.) In 2016, Chris Murphy, of Connecticut, spent nearly 15 hours advocating a House gun-control bill. These efforts were doomed to fail from the start, but they dramatized the stakes of specific policies and, especially in Sanders\u2019s case, paid long-term political dividends.  In many respects, over the last two years the filibuster has protected Democrats from their worst political instincts. The Democratic majority in the House has gleefully passed extreme bills, most recently an overwhelming vote to grant statehood to the District of Columbia. D.C. statehood polls poorly nationwide and would be a poison pill for senators outside liberal coastal enclaves. Yet a Senate Democratic majority freshly sans filibuster would feel intense pressure to take up and pass just these sorts of bills. Radical pieces of legislation with little to no chance of passing today might, with just a few seats changing hands in the Senate, become close-run things.  Put differently: Self-styled moderates in both parties would lose the ability to cast \u201cfree\u201d votes, i.e., votes that help them appeal to swing voters in November by making them appear less partisan, even as those votes do not change the outcome of a particular bill. They would have to be willing either to murder the aspirations of their base voters or to risk being tarred as out of step with the broader electorate back home. In an era with increasingly fierce primaries and increasingly frequent wave elections, either option is politically risky.  Given such an uncertain environment, political mistakes would almost certainly be made \u2014 mistakes that in-cycle incumbent senators in the majority would pay for in the next election. Changes in behavior to correct for initial extremism, both among the rank-and-file and in leadership, would happen only over time, and likely only once voters had had an opportunity to punish incumbents at the ballot box. A hypothetical Republican minority would be able to watch and learn as the Democratic majority groped its way through the new political landscape. At the same time, the minority party would lose its primary consensus-forcing mechanism. Without the legislative filibuster, it would probably pursue two strategies: a full-force public-relations campaign against vulnerable majority-party senators facing reelection, and procedural guerrilla warfare in the chamber.  Politicians loathe going out on a limb politically, but in a filibuster-free Senate, majority-party senators would be forced to take public positions on House bills early to encourage moderation. Activist groups would, likewise, learn to exert continuous public pressure, no doubt abetted by social-media-savvy members of the House on the Democratic Party\u2019s left fringe. All of this would create heightened pressure on moderate Democrats, increasing the risk of making a costly political error.  Unable to bargain over the substance of legislation via the filibuster, minority-party senators would instead play for time behind the scenes as much as possible. The standing rules of the Senate allow individual senators, provided they have the support of party leadership, to prevent any motion from reaching the floor. These \u201csecret holds\u201d gum up the works of legislation and would become ubiquitous. Out in the open, senators would force cloture votes on actions large and small to waste weeks of floor time. Inane amendments designed to force conference committees on all House bills would sprout like mushrooms. Dilatory tactics would become standard operating procedure.  Procedural pushback would filter down to the committees as well. Today, some committees have quorum rules that require members of the minority to be present for the committee to conduct business. If the majority began to advance extreme legislation without bargaining, the minority party would no doubt weaponize these rules, refusing to show up as a means of shutting down committee work. The increased risk that any bill that reached the floor would pass would leave few choices. And should the committees elect to remove minority-party-representation requirements, effectively going nuclear on their quorum rules, they would be further removed from the legislating process. All of this would serve to damage whatever goodwill remained in the Senate. It would also place considerable strain on intraparty relations across the two chambers. The Senate majority leader would learn to pressure the speaker of the House, either to temper extreme House bills or to write legislation as an opening bid for bargaining. Conference committees would become the primary sites for legislating.  Still, a Majority Leader Schumer looking to protect his conference could easily find himself at loggerheads with a Speaker Pelosi attempting to fend off radical factions in her conference chamber. Is Chuck Schumer willing to declare the priorities of the Left dead on arrival? Is he prepared to watch senators defect and vote down these efforts on the floor? Last, but certainly not least, a hypothetical President Biden, a creature of the Senate, might find himself missing the filibuster after a strong GOP showing in the 2022 midterms. After Republicans took control of the upper chamber in 2014, Harry Reid used the legislative filibuster to shield President Obama from having to veto Republican priorities. Should Republicans retake both chambers two years into a Biden presidency, the incumbent would have few instruments available to avoid using his veto pen. No president running for reelection wants to choose between obstructionism, which mobilizes the other party\u2019s base, and accommodation, which saps energy from one\u2019s own. Under these conditions, the majority leader could extract brutal concessions on legislation in return for judicial confirmations \u2014 or vice versa. Those are precisely the sorts of concessions that could feed a primary challenge to Biden from the left. Biden\u2019s advanced age, ideological amorphousness, and limited retail skills on the trail would make him vulnerable to just such an endeavor. A weakened, fragmented Democratic Party might, in turn, hand over unified power to the GOP after 2024, with no legislative filibuster to stand in the way of a conservative agenda. That prospect is almost enough to make one hope that the Democrats choose the nuclear option after all. \n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  It is my belief that a healthy, functioning democracy requires 3 consents:  \n1)  the consent of the minority to majority rule\n2) the consent of the majority to minority dissent\n3)  the consent of all to the rule of law It seems to me that the filibuster is presently enabling the tyranny of the minority, however, without it, we would have the tyranny of the majority.  Neither is desirable nor healthy.  Given that the majority has more power, I think that the removal of the filibuster would be a recipe for extremist legislation that would be as quickly and easily undone after an election as DJT undid the EO's of the Obama administration, and this would lead to chaos and instability, as well as poorer government and public policy."], [87064, "2020-09-03T19:18:33Z", [0.0], ""], [38, "2020-09-03T18:34:41Z", [0.0], "https://www.businessinsider.com/senate-democrats-cautious-on-killing-the-filibuster-biden-agenda-2020-8\nAugust 7, 2020 \"In interviews outside the historic Senate chamber earlier this week, several Democrats said they would not vote to eliminate what Obama calls the \"Jim Crow relic\" requirement that a supermajority of 60 votes must coalesce behind a bill for it to pass the procedure-bound chamber. Others insisted they remain on the fence even while acknowledging the filibuster would make it harder if they win the majority in 2020 for Democrats to pass a long legislative wishlist on everything from climate change to gun control and health care \u2014 the kinds of issues that have long drawn fervent Republican opposition. \"No, I would not vote to eliminate the filibuster,\" Sen. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, said. \"That's not what the Senate is about.\" Killing the rule, Manchin added, would reduce the upper chamber to a \"glorified\" version of the majority-rules House of Representatives.  Sen. Dianne Feinstein also cannot be counted on by those wishing to get rid of the rule. The California Democrat who ranks as the fifth longest-serving senator in a chamber that prides itself on precedent told Insider the filibuster gives all of the country's voters an important say in whether any legislation is passed.  \"I think it's a part of Senate tradition, which creates a sobering effect on the body, which is healthy,\"  Feinstein said in an interview. The Senate filibuster is legendary for making it difficult to move legislation through a chamber where the difference between the majority and minority parties in recent years has been just a handful of seats. It's been the sticking point stalling many big legislative lifts too, like police reform and a border wall during the Trump era and Obama's losing efforts to enact laws capping greenhouse gas emissions and controlling guns. Still, some of the senators interviewed said they remain reluctant to take a position on eliminating the 60-vote threshold. A few cautioned though that they could change their minds if the GOP repeated the same playbook used during the Obama years to block another Democratic president's priorities. \"I suppose Republican intransigence could ultimately provoke me to that,\" said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, adding that it's premature to make a decision now. To change the rules, Senate Democrats would need a simple majority of 51 votes to end the filibuster. Assuming no Republican would back that move if they were in the minority come 2021, that means Democrats can't afford to lose that many of their own when pressing ahead on such a historic change. Democratic power brokers leaning toward repeal\nObama called on Democrats to eliminate the filibuster if they won the Senate and the White House last week while delivering the eulogy for civil rights icon John Lewis in Atlanta. The former president said that if politicians wanted to honor Lewis they'd work to pass bills to protect voting rights, make Election Day a national holiday, and guarantee every American has equal representation. \"And if all this takes eliminating the filibuster \u2014 another Jim Crow relic \u2014 in order to secure the God-given rights of every American, then that's what we should do,\" Obama said. Even before Obama's recent remarks, Democratic leadership had already floated the possibility of doing away with the rule. Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee and himself a former six-term senator from Delaware, told reporters in July that he was open to eliminating the filibuster if Republicans made it difficult for him to move his agenda. \"It's going to depend on how obstreperous they [Republicans] become,\" Biden, who previously supported the filibuster, said. \"But I think you're going to just have to take a look at it.\"  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who is positioned to take the helm of the chamber if Democrats reclaimed the majority, has also signaled that he could move to strike the filibuster. \"Nothing's off the table,\" the New York Democrat told reporters last month.  Schumer's office reiterated those comments when asked Tuesday about changing the Senate rules in 2021 if he's the new majority leader. But based on the number of reluctant Democrats Insider contacted this week, Schumer may not have enough votes to kill the filibuster within his own party. Ross Baker, a political science professor at Rutgers University, said some Democrats may be cautious about killing the filibuster for fear of Republicans using the same tactic whenever they next reclaim the majority. In 2013, then Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada eliminated the filibuster for most of Obama's presidential nominees after Republican opposition meant many key government positions went unfilled.  The unintended consequence was that his successor, Sen. Mitch McConnell, has used that leeway to quickly confirm President Donald Trump's appointees, while also reshaping the judiciary by confirming more than 200 conservative federal judges, a historic number that could have ramifications for decades.  McConnell also expanded Reid's move in 2017 to include the Supreme Court, paving the way for the lifetime appointments of both Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. Sen. Chris Coons, a moderate who now holds Biden's Senate seat from Delaware, said he favors negotiations with Republicans before the party leadership institutes a rule change that allows it to jam bills through the Senate. \"I have long spoken in defense of the filibuster,\" Coons said. \"What I've said was it \u2014 and this is very hypothetical \u2014  if Joe Biden is the president, if there is a Democratic majority, I won't stand by for four years, and allow every effort to make progress to be blocked.\"  \"That means,\" Coons added, \"if these hypotheticals come to pass, there will have to be some negotiations about how we work together to make progress.\" Several Democrats such as Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan said on Tuesday they were focused on winning the Senate in November and that they would \"wait and see\" on the filibuster question. Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine acknowledged the 60-vote requirement would make it harder for Democrats to pass their priorities. But Hillary Clinton's 2016 running mate also said changing the filibuster is not a priority among the Virginians he talks to. \"My constituents never ask me about the Senate rules; they just asked me about minimum wage, the Equality Act, and doing something to deal with background checks,\" Kaine said. \"So it's just not an issue... you should never change a rule just to change a rule.\" Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he favors reforming Senate procedure. But he wouldn't elaborate on how that happens. \"I don't think that it's consistent with the preservation of American democracy as it's used today,\" Murphy said. \"There are lots of different possibilities to reform the filibuster...I think we need to focus on the elections first and then see where we are.\" For the party's left wing, the prospect of winning control of both chambers of Congress and the White House means a legitimate shot at passage of some of the boldest ideas discussed during the Democratic primaries of 2020, where Biden emerged from a pack on more than a dozen contenders.  \"If Mitch McConnell is going to continue to block everything that a Democratic president tries to pass the way he did with Barack Obama,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat and former presidential candidate, said in an interview, \"then it will be time to get rid of the filibuster.\"  \n"], [484, "2020-09-03T17:14:58Z", [0.6], "(no change) Interesting idea from the AEI, a conservative think tank: https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/09/fix-filibuster/615961/"], [29980, "2020-09-02T20:49:43Z", [0.05], ""], [94587, "2020-09-02T01:39:11Z", [0.68], "Agreeing with @bowenmjr   I upped from 65%.

Since that time, five other substantive revisions have occurred in 1979, 1986, 2013 and 2017 respectively. This leaves us with an average of some kind of reform every nine years. As can been seen from a brief glance at the dates however, this doesn\u2019t present a full picture. The Senate tends to go through phases where it fits the majority party\u2019s interest to alter procedure for partisan reasons and when these periods occur the usually last about 4 years (1975-9, 2013-7) but can go as long as 7 (1979-1986). [1] By this logic, 2021 seems like it might be the time for the upper chamber to take a look at its rulebook again. On the one hand we have former President Barack Obama and hopeful Joe Biden calling for an end to filibuster as it becomes more likely that the latter will best Trump in the November election. [2] On the other one must confront the obstacle necessary to make such an ambition reality. There are a couple of different ways to change or even eliminate the filibuster rule. They all involve complex procedure but the long and the short of it for the current discussion is that all of them require at least 51 votes. There is no incentive on the part of political opponents to change the filibuster which means that if change is to happen, a filibuster-destroying majority is the only option. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell uses it as a very effective tool to score political victories.

The democrats winning the presidency and 'flipping' the senate (but not to a super-majority) is perhaps the most likely scenario given current election predictions - the status quo of R presidency and R senate majority is also possible. Other scenarios which make this essentially moot (e.g. Democrats winning one of the presidency or the senate majority) seem to draw ~~40% of the probability mass to me. 2) Conditional on filibuster-busting being relevant, the issue looks highly likely to come up, given high levels of polarisation, likelihood of 'party line' votes on issues, and typical desire of incoming administrations to enact their most important reforms at the start of their term. 3) I think there's some uncertainty of (conditional on 1&2) whether a filibuster-buster ends up being triggered. In favour is that this has happened in the 2 previous administrations when the 'ruling party' faces sustained opposition. The next administration seems more vulnerable to this given growing polarization (/'tit for tat') seems to favour scorched earth procedural warfare over high-handed appeals to the separation and balance of powers (both D and R in the next administration could appeal to R filibuster-busting and D obstructionism in the current one to justify them doing the same now it's 'their turn', which in any case tends to play well with their base).  A lot depends on how many moderates there are in the respective crops of D and R senators. There's a credible negotiated settlement where the senate majority accepts some filibusters from the minority, in return for the minority exercising restraint on when they use them (or just the implicit threat of a 'pocket nuclear option' in horse-trading). Enough bipartisan moderates (+ ?Biden himself) who would prefer not to further erode previously established procedure may allow such an uneasy truce (+/- some desire for mutual de-escalation).  It looks a very fragile one, though: 1) some issues may be that felt too vital for one side or the other to accept compromise 'on principle' - or, for the cynical, one side or the other see being hard-line wins them more with their base than it loses with moderates (cf. the democrats attempting to impeach despite the near certitude of an R senate voting to acquit an R president); 2) re-escalation looks very easy (e.g. Senate majority: \"We can get everything we want if we use a nuclear option here, why offer concessions to the minority given they're still obstructing us on X, Y and Z?\"/ Senate minority: \"If they're just going to bully us with a nuclear option to stop us ever filibustering anything, we might as well go down swinging rather than acquiescing in return for basically nothing\"). So starting at ~~60% for ending up with 1, then shaving off some more given 2&3|1 look likely but not certain.

The question is very craftily written.  \"...expand scope of matters...\"  not end the filibuster.  For example, the filibuster was recently ended on federal judges (2013) and then again for Supreme Court nominees (2017) . HOW?  since it requires 60 to get cloture on a change in Senate Rules? Process for limiting or eliminating the filibuster: According to the Supreme Court's ruling in United States v. Ballin (1892), Senate rules can be changed by a simple majority vote. Nevertheless, under current Senate rules, a rule change could itself be filibustered, requiring two-thirds of senators who are present and voting to end debate. (This differs from the usual requirement for three-fifths of sworn senators.)[1] Nuclear option\nMain article: Nuclear option Despite the two-thirds requirement described above being written into the Senate rules, any Senator may attempt to nullify a Senate rule, starting by making a point of order that the rule is unconstitutional or just that the meaning of the rule should not be followed. The presiding officer is generally expected to rule in favor of the rules of the Senate, but under rule XX, \"every appeal therefrom shall be decided at once, and without debate\" and therefore by a simple majority as there is no need for a vote on cloture. This happened in 2013, when Harry Reid of the Democratic Party raised a point of order that \"the vote on cloture under rule XXII for all nominations other than for the Supreme Court of the United States is by majority vote.\" The presiding officer overruled the point of order, and Reid appealed the ruling. Mitch McConnell of the Republican Party raised a parliamentary inquiry on how many votes were required to appeal the chair's ruling in that instance. The presiding officer replied, \"A majority of those Senators voting, a quorum being present, is required.\" Reid's appeal was sustained by a 52\u201348 vote, and the presiding officer then ruled that the Senate had established a precedent that cloture on nominations other than those for the Supreme Court requires only a simple majority.[1][82] On April 6, 2017, that precedent was further changed by McConnell and the Republican majority, in a 52\u201348 vote, to include Supreme Court nominations.[83][84]  If Democrates get a Senate majority, they can overrule the Senate Parlimentarian on the \"scope of the filibuster\" with a majority vote.   My forcast of 65% may be high, but I do see, based on  close Senate state polling, the Democrats taking the Senate.
