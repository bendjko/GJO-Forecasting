That would put total infections at 85% of the population, which one would expect to provide herd immunity. The average infection rate for the 50 states + DC has increased from 0.82 to 0.87 over just the past three days.  Is this due to the storm, virus mutations, or loosening of COVID restrictions?  I think it's more of the latter, but I really don't know.  Three states have Rt values > 1.00 (ND, SD & WY), and AK is at 0.99.  The infection rates are low, but the trend is not good.

Therefore, Rt measures tend to auto-correlated, starting much above 1.0, decreasing toward 1.0 at the daily case peak, then decreasing further from there. If the Rt measure uses any smoothing factors, it shouldn't increase without some change in the population.  However, as the cases get very low, the Rt will increase back toward 1.0. For example, if 100 people give the virus to 90 others, that's a 0.9 Rt. But, if there is only 1 case and that person give the virus to 2 people, that's an Rt of 2.0 (in very simplified terms). This fact provides an alternative way for a state to have an Rt slightly above 1.0 on March 31. That is, a state could be so successful over the next 8 weeks that a small outbreak could increase the value. The other way that it could happen is that a state's population could change its behavior in Mid-March, increasing the contacts between infected and susceptible hosts. This might include the return to large gatherings in the Spring.  While the general trend over the next two months should be downward (especially as more people become immune or spend more time outside), it seems like there are reasonable odds that the trend will flatten or reverse by the end of March (although at much lower daily case counts than November).

Looking at the error bands for the data on Rt.live, the answer could be anything between 0 and 49.  As we learned from previous questions, Rt can be quite volatile, at least as tracked by Rt.live.  I haven't been watching Rt on covidactnow, so if any of you have been following that data please comment. I also note that the two sources of Rt data differ greatly -- Rt for Vermont is 1.17 on Rt.live but only 1.02 on covidactnow.org.  For Hawaii the numbers are 1.14 and 0.89.  So Hawaii either has rapidly increasing new infections, or rapidly falling infections.  Take your pick.  This question uses the lower figures from covidactnow. I'll start with a forecast favoring the lower brackets.  So far the vaccine projections at https://covid19-projections.com/path-to-herd-immunity/ have held up.  If this continues the rate of new infections will be ~70% lower by March 31.  But fewer new infections does not mean lower Rt.  Rt reflects the rate of change of new infections, not the absolute level.  If new infections fall a lot but then bounce up in late March the average Rt should show an increase in the number of states with Rt > 0.99.
