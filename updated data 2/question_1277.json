The news offered a rare sign of comity at a time when Iran has been in an escalating cycle of confrontation with its Persian Gulf neighbors and with the United States, including the shooting down of drones, the seizure of tankers and, most recently, an attack on major oil installations in Saudi Arabia (Para. 1-2). The ship had not left Bandar Abbas, a port in southern Iran, as of midday, and it was not clear how quickly it would set sail. Erik Hanell, chief executive of the tanker\u2019s owner, the shipping company Stena Bulk, told SVT, a Swedish television station, that he hoped it would be a matter of hours (Para. 6). Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain said early on Monday that there was \u201ca very high degree of probability\u201d that Iran was responsible for the strikes in Saudi Arabia, and he did not rule out British participation in military retaliation. The topic is sure to be aired this week at the United Nations General Assembly\u2019s annual gathering of heads of government, which will be attended by Mr. Johnson, President Trump and President Hassan Rouhani of Iran, among many others (Para. 10).

Retrieved from\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/23/world/middleeast/iran-british-tanker-release.html **** A Year Later, Iran Finds Evaporating Sympathy at the U.N.    Sanger and Fassihi (2019) Sept. 23, stated that: When Iran\u2019s president and foreign minister arrived in New York a year ago for the opening of the United Nations General Assembly, they were riding high. At news conferences and in television appearances, they cast President Trump as an untrustworthy deal-breaker, and European leaders largely sided with the pair in a desperate effort to preserve the 2015 nuclear agreement after the United States renounced it.  \nThis year could not be more different. Suddenly, President Hassan Rouhani and his witty, often biting American-educated foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, are on the defensive. They are denying any Iranian involvement in the destruction of two major Saudi oil facilities, an assertion that even former Secretary of State John Kerry, who negotiated the nuclear accord four years ago and has become its biggest defender, finds far-fetched. Iran, he said, was behind the attack \u201cone way or the other\u201d (Para. 1-3). But \u201cIran has come to this year\u2019s U.N.G.A. with a real wake-up call that what they are able to get from Europeans is no more than some limited political cover for support of the nuclear deal,\u201d said Ellie Geranmayeh, the deputy head of Middle East and North Africa studies for the European Council on Foreign Relations (Para 7). Iranian officials, she said, have arrived in New York discovering that the Europeans cannot offer any substantive economic relief, and that even a French-led initiative to issue a credit line of $15 billion, essentially an advance payment on Iranian oil shipments, is likely to fail. Washington will most likely not issue waivers, and European banks are unwilling to join the effort if they believe they will be banned from clearing transactions in American dollars. Two weeks ago, it appeared that Iran might find a way out, taking Mr. Trump up on his offer of negotiations. But the attacks on Saudi Arabia, and the American accusations of Iranian involvement, have all but killed that possibility, American officials said (Para. 7-9). The hawkish Mr. Pompeo clearly senses that the attacks on the Saudi oil facilities, for which he blamed the Iranians before any forensic evidence had been gathered, have fundamentally changed the negotiating dynamics. He finally has the opportunity he has sought for 18 months: a chance to kill Europe\u2019s effort to neutralize sanctions (Para. 17). Mr. Pompeo doubled down on his critique on Sunday, saying the Iranians are \u201cbloodthirsty and looking for war,\u201d and suggesting that as the sanctions cut deeper, the Iranian people will demand changes in their government \u2014 though he stopped just short of demanding regime change. \u201cThey\u2019re operating today in five countries,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said of the Iranians on Sunday on CBS News\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s expensive. They\u2019ve already had to make difficult decisions about whether they\u2019re going to feed their people, provide medicine to their people, or they\u2019re going to launch missiles into Saudi Arabia\u201d (Para. 17-19).

The claims, made without supporting evidence, appeared to move the Saudis closer to directly blaming Iran, a chief ally of the Houthis, for the attacks on Saturday, which have heightened tensions between Iran and the United States, raising fears of a wider armed conflict (Para. 1-2). But no clear public message had yet emerged about the preferred Saudi response. Prominent supporters of the monarchy have portrayed the strikes as an assault on the world and its energy markets, not just Saudi Arabia, or have even talked of revenge (Para. 11). \u201cWhat is required is nothing more than the destruction of Iran\u2019s oil installations, and if there is a capacity, nuclear facilities and military bases as well,\u201d argued Turki al-Hamad, a prominent Saudi political analyst and novelist. But other social media accounts known for pro-government propaganda argued for patience, saying that wisdom favors choosing the right time and means to respond. Mohammed Alyahya, editor in chief of the English website of the Saudi-owned Al Arabiya news channel, emphasized that the rulers of the kingdom were deliberating carefully.

After receiving assurances from Tehran that the ship would not discharge its oil in Syria.  We will have to see what happens in the next few days referencing the current geopolitical events involving Iran and Saudi Arabia with the US involvement increasing tensions  the area. Houthi Drone Strikes Disrupt Almost Half Of Saudi Oil Exports\nNPR (2019) September 14, stated that: Yemen's Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for drone strikes on two Saudi Aramco oil facilities early Saturday, according to a statement by a Houthi spokesman. Reuters and The Wall Street Journal report that about half of the country's oil production has been disrupted, or 5 million barrels a day. Saudi Arabia produces approximately one-tenth of the world's crude oil, but for now, the impact on global oil prices is unknown, as markets are closed for the weekend (Para. 1-2).\nHouthi rebels, partnered with Iran, have clashed with a Saudi-led coalition since March 2015, after the rebels ousted Yemeni President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi in January of that year. The Houthi rebels now control large parts of northern Yemen and have launched similar strikes on oil facilities and airports in Saudi Arabia this year. A cease-fire between the Houthis and Saudi-backed government forces was agreed to in December, but has not held (Para. 10). \"Tehran is behind nearly 100 attacks on Saudi Arabia while Rouhani and Zarif pretend to engage in diplomacy. Amid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world's energy supply. There is no evidence the attacks came from Yemen\" (Para 14). Tehran's support for the Houthi rebels could escalate the confrontation between the U.S. and Iran over the 2015 nuclear deal, which Trump pulled out of in 2018. Immediately after the withdrawal, the U.S. put in place a campaign of \"maximum pressure,\" blocking most of Iran's crucial oil exports. NPR reported that the July seizure of an Iranian oil tanker by British authorities in Gibraltar sparked an international diplomatic crisis, as the U.S. pushed to keep the ship detained under suspicion that it was headed to supply Syria. The ship was eventually released (Para. 17). NPR Website. (2019).Houthi Drone Strikes Disrupt Almost Half Of Saudi Oil Exports. NPR. Middle East. September 14, 2019.

Drone strikes on crucial Saudi Arabian oil facilities have disrupted about half of the kingdom's oil capacity, or 5% of the daily global oil supply, CNN Business reported earlier Saturday. Yemen's Houthi rebels took responsibility for the attacks but they are often backed by Iran.\nBut preliminary indications are that the attacks did not originate from Yemen and likely originated from Iraq, according to a source with knowledge of the incident. The same official said the damage was caused by an armed drone attack.\nCNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen said there have been more than 200 drone and missile attacks launched by Houthi rebels from Yemen into Saudi Arabia, and none have been as effective as Saturday's attack, lending credence to the belief that the attack did not originate from Yemen (Para. 1-4).

Karimi and Gambrell (2019) Sep. 7, stated that: Also on Saturday, satellite images showed that a once-detained Iranian oil tanker pursued by the US appears to be off the coast of Syria, where Tehran reportedly promised the vessel would not go when authorities in Gibraltar agreed to release it several weeks ago (Para. 12). The tanker Adrian Darya-1, formerly known as the Grace-1, turned off its Automatic Identification System late Monday, leading to speculation it would be heading to Syria. Other Iranian oil tankers have similarly turned off their tracking beacons in the area, with analysts saying they believe crude oil ends up in Syria in support of embattled President Bashar Assad\u2019s government.\nImages obtained by The Associated Press early Saturday from Maxar Technologies appeared to show the vessel off Syria\u2019s coast, some 2 nautical miles (3.7 kilometers) off shore under intermittent cloud cover. Iranian and Syrian officials have not acknowledged the vessel\u2019s presence there. There was no immediate report in Iranian state media about the ship, though authorities earlier said the 2.1 million barrels of crude oil onboard had been sold to an unnamed buyer. The oil on board would be worth about $130 million on the global market, but it remains unclear who would buy the oil as they\u2019d face the threat of US sanctions. The new images matched a black-and-white image earlier tweeted by John Bolton, the US national security adviser. \u201cAnyone who said the Adrian Darya-1 wasn\u2019t headed to #Syria is in denial,\u201d Bolton tweeted. \u201cWe can talk, but #Iran\u2019s not getting any sanctions relief until it stops lying and spreading terror!\u201d US prosecutors in federal court allege the Adrian Darya\u2019s owner is Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard, which answers only to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. On Wednesday, the US imposed new sanctions on an oil shipping network it alleged had ties to the Guard and offered up to $15 million for anyone with information that disrupts its paramilitary operations. Brian Hook, the US special envoy for Iran, also has reportedly emailed or texted captains of Iranian oil tankers, trying to scare them into not delivering their cargo (Para. 12-20).

Given that the British seizure of Grace 1 preceded the Iranian seizure of the Stena Impero, I will take it that this was a retaliation and the latter will not be released without the former being released.
