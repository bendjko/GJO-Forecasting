It makes up about 25% of cases today: https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-covid-cases-10-percent-hypertransmissible-delta-variant-spreads-n1272895. It is stated in the question that the Delta Variant had a share of 2.7% in the US in the week ending May 22 2021. Since vaccination rates are slowing, let's assume for the sake of simplicity that that effect has already fully taken place in the population from late May to early July. We know infections spread roughly exponentially (admittedly this is a large assumption, but just for a simplistic model), so let's say that we can model the spread as c*r^t where r is some fixed rate, t is number of weeks since the week ending in May 22 2021, and c is some initial constant, namely 2.7%. In 5.5 weeks til the end of June we have 2.7*r^(5.5)=20 -> r ~ 1.44. If we just set this number of weeks at 5 or 6 we get r = 1.5 and 1.4 respectively. For r=1.4 we have 2.7*1.4^t > 67 so we need t > 9.5, for r=1.44 we have t > 8.8, and for r=1.5 we need 7.9. In the 6 weeks from May 22 to Jul 1, we need 2.7*r^6 ~ 25, and we can see r=1.44 works about the best. The accuracy of this fit means that this model selected cannot be immediately rejected from our current data points. All these choices lie within the second possibility. So the second option definitely seems like the most likely possibility with this in mind. It is possible that there is some noise with this estimate, admittedly. With this analysis in mind the last two possibilities seem far too unlikely, especially considering that America does not contain COVID particularly well as James noted, so I give these possibilities a 5% and a 1% probability respectively. It's already July 2 and the percentage is about 20% so the chance of the first choice is clearly 0%.
