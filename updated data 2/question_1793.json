There hasn't been a lot of polling, you can see all of it on Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Puerto_Rican_status_referendum), but the latest poll has this question at a statistical tie (https://radioisla.tv/jennifer-gonzalez-domina-la-contienda-a-la-comisaria-residente/) with a lot of voters undecided.  The biggest complication is that compared to previous statehood elections the anti-statehood party (the PDP) is not boycotting the referendum. Their boycotts are what led the margin to be so lopsided in favor of statehood in 2012 and 2017. Indeed, this time the referendum will be held the same day as local elections in Puerto Rico and with the question being a straight Yes/No as opposed to the 3 part questions on previous ballots there is no way for the anti-statehood block (which considers a myriad of options) to be divided. Additionally, while the PNP have a plurality of support the rest of the support is divided amongst the PDP and opposition parties a few of whom have different plans for statehood. Furthermore 6% of PNP voters think the question is pointless because it has not been congressionally approved and sentiment on the island is that this referendum is a political stunt for the PNP to drive its voters to the polls. Frankly, I don't think mainlanders understand politics in Puerto Rico at all as evidence by the crowd giving this a 95% chance of passing. Views in Puerto Rico actually appear quite jaded on the statehood question, there was even a dust-up amongst legislators of Puerto Rican descent and politicians on the island about the best way forward (https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/new-aoc-vel-zquez-bill-puerto-rico-s-status-sparks-n1238192). In my estimation what is driving people to be confident in this question is they see statehood as something Puerto Ricans want following the Hurricane, they think Puerto Ricans vote like democrats and hate Donald Trump, and they think Puerto Rico is desperate to shed their status (while the latter is true there is a lot of debate over how to do it and also this referendum many believe will not change their status).  TLDR: While the existing evidence (polling and sentiment following the hurricane) supports an affirmative outcome there remains a lot of uncertainty as this will be the first referendum in which the PDP is not boycotting and views of statehood on the island are complicated by perceptions that this being on the ballot is a political stunt. Additionally, polling shows a toss-up vote with a lot of undecided voters.
