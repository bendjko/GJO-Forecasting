Following my previous comments and along the lines of the discussion between @ForecastingNovice and @SE_Meyer, I had assumed that you would need a worsening economic environment to cause a very bad quarter of defaults, for a positive outcome to this question, as Aug20 to Dec20 had been relatively benign and this was a trailing rate. Now I am not so sure. \nThe links that @SE_Meyer provided, reminded me that the individual loan items are what is important. Given the majority of loans expire in the first half any year, in H1 21 there is a high chance that we get significant defaults from Entertainment or Leisure companies, who simply won't have the cashflow to repay notionals, and bankruptcy may actually be preferable to the pretend and extend scenario I had been pushing. \nIndeed, Fitch has 40% of leisure/entertainment, 18% of retail and 9% of the healthcare/pharmaceutical loan sectors defaulting this year (https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/fitch-us-leveraged-loan-default-insight-default-activity-slows-in-november-loans-of-concern-total-declines-20-11-2020). From what I can gather their analysts have been on the conservative side, but they still see 7-8% default rate in 2021. Fitch was still predicting 4.5% for 2020 in late December, and they may have a slightly difference universe to S&P, so even haircutting their number by 0.5% for conservatism and 0.7% for the spread between the two agencies, you would still get 5.8% for the year. If these defaults were due to loans maturing as opposed to breaching of covenants (less likely), it would put most of defaults into H1 21. In the absence of any more information, I will return my forecast to the initial level of 42% until the January numbers come out, where unless there are numbers of around 5-7bn of defaults I will then drop my forecast once again."], [95992, "2021-01-12T04:47:56Z", [0.03], "Massive fiscal stimulus plus the fact that this is a rolling 12M stat.
