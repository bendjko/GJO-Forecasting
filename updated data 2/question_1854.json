It may well be that Japarov, talking about parliamentary elections \"in autumn\" during his state visit to Kazakhstan recently, did mean nothing else than talking, making a wish, and expressing his personal preference, and thereby ignoring the current 2011 constitution, trying to undermine all the doubts, setting the agenda and begin to change the framing of the referendum in his own advantage. He may try to accustom his people to another insurgence this summer, this time toppling the current constitution and the parliament as the Kyrgyz people know it.\nhttps://emerging-europe.com/news/kyrgyzstans-problematic-new-constitution/"], [34959, "2021-03-08T04:44:43Z", [0.99, 0.0, 0.01, 0.0], ""], [691, "2021-03-07T15:51:14Z", [0.96, 0.0, 0.04, 0.0], ""], [88452, "2021-03-05T06:47:09Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "It seems plans for a second, \"full-fledged constitutional referendum\" with a final draft of a new constitution lag.
