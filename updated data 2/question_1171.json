Inside view: \n- From EWP: \"This small central African country has been in a protracted political crisis since President Pierre Nkurunziza engineered the extension of his term in office in 2015. Burundi\u2019s ranking of 16th for 2018\u201319 is its lowest in the past three years. As of 2017, V-Dem data reflect that the government of Burundi\u2019s respect for civil liberties no longer varies across different areas of the country, lowering its risk score from our prior assessment. Nevertheless, Burundi continues to exhibit many factors associated with a high risk of mass killing, including a lack of freedom of movement for men, an anocratic regime type, political killings, a history of mass killing, a recent coup attempt, and high infant mortality.\" [1]\n- the post-2015 violence and unrest seem to have calmed down [2]. However, this paywalled article seems to suggest it could get worse [3].\n- elections are upcoming next year [4]. It's unclear when exactly. The president has claimed he won't run again. [5]\n- media and NGOs have been banned recently apparently. [6] Overall judgment:\n- the situation doesn't look very promising. However, since the elections are \"only\" going to be held next year, I think there are few flash points where violence could erupt again and be sustained sufficiently long.\n- my informed gut judgment is 5%.
