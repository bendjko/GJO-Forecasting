The Governments of Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador have each signed on for $1 billion each in US government funding for infrastructure projects as part of Am\u00e9rica Crece.\n[...]\nOver thirty years after the end of the Cold War, the region once again finds itself in a macro-geopolitical conflict. Faced with increased investment by Chinese firms in the region, the Trump administration launched Am\u00e9rica Crece to advance the interests of US corporations.  \u201cThere is clearly a growing competition between the United States and China,\u201d Binette said. \u201cBut it is very problematic for countries to choose between the United States and China.\u201d Simply put, the United States sees China as a threat in Latin America.  In recent years, the United States has regularly warned business leaders in the region against doing business with China. In spite of this, China represents an ideal business partner for cash starved states in the region. Since 2010, companies associated with the Chinese government have averaged 10 billion dollars of annual investment in Latin America per year. These investments have gone to many sectors and industries, particularly infrastructure projects, mining and oil drilling, and other energy projects.  \u201cIt is all about the availability of capital, quick loans, a willingness to navigate Latin America\u2019s context of corruption and rule of law that would deter companies from Europe and the United States,\u201d Binette said. \u201cFor China, everything is part of the package. They offer the countries an attractive package. Governments can offer immediate results.\u201d \u201cThe United States cannot rival China,\u201d he said. The Chinese option has opened new options for investments, leading Latin American governments to distance themselves from Taiwan as part of the \u201cOne China\u201d policy, and grow closer to Beijing. In Central America, Costa Rica, Panam\u00e1, El Salvador and the Dominican Republic have ended diplomatic ties with Taiwan in return for development funds from China. Only Guatemala, Honduras, Belize, and Nicaragua continue to maintain diplomatic ties with Taiwan, which means that they mostly don\u2019t trade with China.\n[...]\nBoth parties in the US continue to see Chinese investments in the region as a threat. In September 2020, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee launched the America Labor, Economic competitiveness, Alliances, Democracy and Security (America LEADS) Act to counter Chinese influence. The LEADS Act is designed to invest in American competitiveness; support American alliances and partners; restore and advance a values-centered foreign policy; and ensure China pays a price for what senators argue are predatory actions.\nhttps://towardfreedom.org/story/america-crece-washingtons-new-investment-push-in-latin-america/ ___ \" It was an unusually noticeable 109th Taiwan National Day in India, with posters and flags hung outside the Chinese embassy by a ruling party member and Taiwan\u2019s president thanking \u201cdear friends in India\u201d for sending wishes for their annual celebration.\n[...]\nThe other countries to which she had expressed appreciation through her Twitter timeline were St Kitts and Nevis and Honduras.

Having tried to establish an outside view, I turned to a colleague who works in the international affairs community and who follows Asia, to find out more about that and get the Inside View.    Here is what he said: \"Taiwan didn\u2019t lose any partners in 2020 but I think lost two in the Pacific alone in 2019.  I\u2019d say the rate of loss is accelerating, as Beijing gets better at peeling away, and then keeping away, partners.  I can\u2019t speak to the Latin American partners.  Of the four Pacific partners, Palau and the Marshalls are probably secure because they\u2019re in free association with the U.S.  Tuvalu is probably okay.  Nauru is in my opinion the shakiest; they have zero natural resources, virtually no economy, and the island is barely livable, so they could be bought by Beijing probably without a ton of trouble.  But no one is likely to dump Taiwan in the next six weeks.\" The logic of my initial analysis was: if Taiwan typically loses recognition by one country per year, and they have not yet lost an ally in 2020, they are due to lose one, thus 90% probability of Yes.    However, the fine grained analysis of my colleague, coupled with the fact that the time horizon for the event to happen is now quite short (six weeks), I am revising my forecast to only 5% Yes.\n"], [90433, "2020-10-13T18:27:39Z", [0.05], ""], [95800, "2020-10-13T17:16:22Z", [0.07], ""], [84880, "2020-10-13T16:35:06Z", [0.01], ""], [88614, "2020-10-13T15:38:55Z", [0.01], ""], [95789, "2020-10-13T13:44:35Z", [0.04], "I affirm my forecast.

Besides, maybe a bit of supply chain disruption will make it sure that these pesky Americans or Europeans do not have enough vaccines to do vaccine diplomacy.
