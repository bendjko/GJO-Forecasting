The IMF has since released a January 2021 World Economic Outlook Update to account for policy support and vaccines to increase economic activity (IMF, 2021). Due to the support of the international community in combating COVID-19, economic relief and activity has increased and the market has adapted to redirect the course of economic growth over 2021. With the ability to obtain the COVID-19 vaccines becoming widely available soon, the impact to the economy has softened and thus allowed for a stronger recovery in the market (IMF, 2021). Policy implementations such as providing for households, providing resources for healthcare facilities, and economic policies to limit persistent damage have all aggressively combatted the damage of COVID-19 (IMF, 2021). The 15% No estimate in my assessment pertains to the impact of differing strains of the COVID-19 virus. While the vaccines have proved to be effective in most sectors, if a new strain of the virus is not combatted effectively by the virus, more research, containment strategies, and economic recovery programs could stall the hopeful outlook outlined in the January 2021 World Economic Outlook Update (IMF, 2021).

The presence of new variants of the COVID-19 virus poses a level of uncertainty for the world, but with the vaccination being distributed, the outlook is much better than in 2020. \"We are in a race between mutating virus, and vaccinations and a lot depends on the outcome of this race\", says Gopinath.    https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2021/01/28/tr012621-transcript-of-the-world-economic-outlook-update-press-briefing#:~:text=In%20our%20latest%20World%20Economic,to%204.2%20percent%20in%202022. https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2021/01/26/2021-world-economic-outlook-update"], [98868, "2021-03-07T21:27:26Z", [0.9], "America's labor market serves as a good litmus test for analyzing the global economy. Unemployment is particularly helpful in determining the outlook of global futures. The US labor market recovered faster than expected with a unemployment rate of 6.9% reported in OCT2020. However, the true state of employment will emerge once the heavy government aid subsides (Curr, 2020). The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) projected that all G-20 countries, other than China, would experience a recession in 2020 as a result of the pandemic. The global GDP will not return to pre-pandemic levels until Q3 2021. While the OECD projections differed from November 2019 to September 2020 given the sharp dip caused by the pandemic lockdowns, the rate of growth remain largely the same (World Economic Fund, n.d.). However, the global GDP is not expected to extend above pre-pandemic levels until 2022. The continuance of the pandemic and associated economic impacts have suppressed economic predictions going into 2021 (Ritcher, 2021). In June, 2020, the IMF  reported a 1.9 percent decrease in economic growth as compared to its April, 2020 predictions. For 2021, the IMF forecasted a 5.4 percent growth in GDP, which is 6.5 percent lower than the predictions made in January 2020 prior to the pandemic (IMF, 2020). In October, 2020, the IMF projected a 5.2 percent growth in world GDP for 2021.  A primary factor in analyzing the world's economic recovery timeline is linked to the roll out of the vaccine. In October, 2020, the timeline for roll out was debatable. Since then, vaccines are becoming available and economic uncertainty is becoming more clear. Also in October, 2020, US unemployment was 6.9 percent. By January, 2021, unemployment fell to 6.3 percent. As vaccines offer more opportunity for economies to open, then the labor market is likely to benefit thus increasing the potential for GDP growth. Overall, vaccine confidence and falling unemployment rates below that which was anticipated will increase the potential for a higher projection for GDP growth in 2021. However, the continuance of government aid and realization of long-term economic scars present the potential to temper positive projections.  Curr, H. (2020, November 16).

The recovery will vary across countries and regions, dependent on access to medical interventions, effective policy support, and infection spillovers from other countries. Despite the toll of the pandemic on the economy and people, economic activity is adapting. There are, however, risks to this outlook. If progress is slower-than-anticipated and there is a struggle to contain the virus and vaccinate people, this could weaken confidence and lead to withdrawn policy support. Growth is going to depend on vaccine rollout and the incidence of COVID-19 infections. Though, it is expected that therapies will gradually become more widely accessible during 2021-2022.

Keep in mind that the 10-year Treasury is The benchmark for a lot of things in the stock market and for mortgages. Things were so bad in the repo market that chairman Powell didn't even touch on it in his speech today. He is trying to reassure markets and doesn't want to draw attention to what a lot of people don't look at.

This means major financial institutions are expecting the 10 year treasury to crash very soon, and this is something that is a benchmark for most of the economy.

The Morgan Stanley report that we are now entering the self-sustaining phase of the V-shaped recovery initially projected in 2020. This assessment directly conflicts with the initial worries this past fall that the pandemic will have a bigger impact on private-sector risk appetite and, hence, global growth; however, experts say that consumers have driven the recovery. To continue progress in economic recovery, the reports state that 3 key factors will characterize the next stage: synchronized global growth, an emerging-market rebound, and the return of inflation. So I will be looking for these indicators in news/reporting to determine whether my confidence will increase or decrease in the coming weeks.  Goldman Sachs also increased its US economic growth forecast for 2021, as Democratic officials make it more likely to see a larger stimulus package adopted in the first quarter of 2021. Unemployment is also projected to decrease to 4.8% in 2021. Although the U.S. GDP growth is only one part of the overall global GDP, I think it's still an indicator. Overall, my confidence is still discouraged by the news on the virus front, namely the slow pace of vaccination rollouts and and the emergence of additional infectious virus strains, and the affect this will have on spending, restrictions, and economic recovery despite the stimulus.

Compared to September the news on vaccines is more positive, and mobility graphs (https://covid19.apple.com/mobility) have trended down, \"theoretically\" pushing more growth from 2020 into 2021. \nThe Oct 20 report growth estimate of 5.2% reflected \"a moderate downturn projected for 2020 and [was] consistent with expectations of persistent social distancing\" and a \"level of global GDP in 2021 [that] is expected to be a modest 0.6 percent above that of 2019. (https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2020/09/30/world-economic-outlook-october-2020 executive summary). \nSo while I don't see any reason for them to change their moderate downturn projection in 2021, their persistent social distancing expectation should lessen.  I am projecting the over, but with limited conviction (60%), especially as we have only had 4 years in the last forty with growth above 5.2% (www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDP_RPCH@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD)."], [89826, "2020-12-09T23:42:29Z", [0.99], ""], [96972, "2020-12-09T20:16:19Z", [0.65], "Yes.

Global growth averages at about %2.5 per year and there is likely to be a little over %4 contraction in GDP in 2020, making for an especially low base rate. That means world GDP is about %6.5 below trend, and it only needs to gain less than half of the distance back to the trend line in order to do better than the IMF forecast. Recovery in monthly data measuring economic activity is strong; such as PMI, other measures of manufacturing output and unemployment. The shock appears to not be very persistent. The vaccine news, which was not available as of October 2020, should also improve the situation. I think a lot of people are being misled about the current macroeconomic outlook by drawing inappropriate analogies to the Great Recession or the Great Depression, even though the data we have available is showing a much faster recovery. Despite this optimistic outlook, however, one must be mindful of tail risks in the forecast. Low growth years are by no means rare and the next year could turn out to be one due to bad luck.
