To hit 339,999 in the next 10 days, the average number cases/day would need to increase to 3818, or a rate of increase of approximately 5% each consecutive day.

Assuming a more natural and varied increase closer to Mar 26-Apr 3 as initial cases moved fairly rapidly from 1452 (about where they are now) over a 10-day period to 4324 but with a more natural curve accounting for spread, the total number of cases would be approximately 326,000.

Thus, the daily positivity rate fell to less than 0.9% in both pillars. Two conclusions make me shift my forecast more towards the crowd temporarily:\n1) I probably overestimated the need to further expand testing capacity, as current capacity utilization indicates that testing has never been stretched or fully used in the past 10 days or so. It is just speculation to contemplate about the rationale behind it (Are tests too costly? Do people have to have symptoms to be eligible for testing? Who pays for tests, and who decides on the admission to tests? Will the world be short of test kits soon, as densely populated nations (India, Pakistan, Brasil and others) absorb an ever growing share of testing material; is the NHS therefore setting aside test kits for the medium term/possible second wave?) 2) Positivity rate is volatile, but seems to decline overall.

As we'll see this is not completely accurate... https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/ The numbers for testing are harder to find and evaluate, since England + Wales is reported separately from Scotland and Northern Ireland/other territories.  https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public\nsee 'Time series' First of all, the \"Sit Rep\" Situation Report of the WHO will be published with data \" received by WHO from national authorities by 10:00 CEST\" on a regular basis which will be Sit Rep No. 162 published on 30 June 2020 10:00 CEST in our case . Since the UK report their figures on a daily basis at 5:00 pm GMT/UTC +1 (~ British Summer Time (BST) or 6:00 pm CEST), the data as of 30 June 2020 presumably will be included in this resolution, if WHO means \"10:00 pm CEST\". It has not been mentioned explicitly, so it's a little confusing to me, but I will watch that. Thus, the time span for cases under investigation will end on 30 June 2020 from my perspective. Then, the \"date of activity\" lags behind the \"date of report\" in the UK figures for one day, which should not matter under normal circumstances, as long as reports flow in consistently and continuously. In the UK testing methodology, it is distinguished between four different Pillars, \"Pillar 1\" to \"Pillar 4\",  \"Breakdown of testing by testing strategy \u2018pillars\u2019     Pillar 1: swab testing in Public Health England (PHE) labs and NHS hospitals for those with a clinical need, and health and care workers\n    Pillar 2: swab testing for the wider population, as set out in government guidance\n    Pillar 3: serology testing to show if people have antibodies from having had COVID-19\n    Pillar 4: serology and swab testing for national surveillance supported by PHE, ONS, Biobank, universities and other partners to learn more about the prevalence and spread of the virus and for other testing research purposes, for example on the accuracy and ease of use of home testing\" of which Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 seem to be the most fundamental and have the most capacity, and numbers of Pillar 3 & 4 do not flow in to the cumulative number of confirmed cases: \"Testing capacity as of 2 June  At 9am on 2 June (as reported on 3 June 2020), testing capacity was 220,213  Pillar 1       Pillar 2        Pillar 3      Pillar 4          Total\n 63,213       116,000       40,000      1,000            220,213       Lab capacity However, the total number of \"tested people\" (1,267,099) (corrected for double tested persons and in contrast to the cumulative number of tests (1,770,451)) is only available for pillar 1, which means a discount with a 39.7 per cent of excess testing per person. The Pillar 2 tests (116,000 capacity per day on 2 June 2020) have almost twice the capacity of Pillar 1 (63,213 per day), but have faded in to its full extent at a later stage of the national testing strategy at the end of April, e.g.: 23.04.2020 UK Pillar 1 (plus Pillar 2 for Wales)    20088\n23.04.2020 UK Pillar 2 (excluding Wales)     2985 26.04.2020 UK Pillar 1 (plus Pillar 2 for Wales  17939\n26.04.2020 UK Pillar 2 (excluding Wales)   11119 29.04.2020 UK Pillar 1 (plus Pillar 2 for Wales)     23648\n29.04.2020 UK Pillar 2 (excluding Wales)    28539 02.05.2020 UK Pillar 1 (plus Pillar 2 for Wales)   39095\n02.05.2020 UK Pillar 2 (excluding Wales)    64894 That is why Pillar 1 tests only account for 37% (1,770,451 tests out of 4,786,219) of all cumulative tests so far, but for about 67,1% (187,823 confirmed cases out of 279,856)  of all confirmed cases so far. Pillar 2 accounts for about 54% (2,582,681 out of 4,786,219 tests), but \"only\" 32,9% (92,033 out of 279,856) cases reported so far. Of course, Pillar 1-tests are more likely to confirm new cases, as they are taken from persons with health issues (or symptoms) and people on the front line. It is also likely that the testing strategy contains testing more and more asymptomatic persons in the wake of contact tracing (which contains a lot of negative persons) after Pillar 2 has increased to higher capacity, or this suggests that \"testing effectiveness\" is somehow less with Pillar 2-tests than with Pillar 1-tests. Having said this, one can assert that the number of daily Pillar 1 tests for UK as a whole (including Pillar 2 for Wales) has on average hovered around 27k and 35k (rough estimate) for most of the time since late April, while Pillar 2 tests have steadily increased (with a few outliers under 50k) to between 80k and 85k in late May, and with a short peak of 118,419 tests on 20 May 2020.

The number of confirmed new cases seems to correspond: 31.05.2020 UK Pillar 1 (plus Pillar 2 for Wales)     427 (1.34% positivity rate)\n31.05.2020 UK Pillar 2 (excluding Wales)     1509 (1.87% p.r.) 01.06.2020 UK Pillar 1 (plus Pillar 2 for Wales)     383 (1.39% p.r.)\n01.06.2020 UK Pillar 2 (excluding Wales)     1187 (1.62% p.r.) 02.06.2020 UK Pillar 1 (plus Pillar 2 for Wales)      528 (1.76% p.r.)\n02.06.2020 UK Pillar 2 (excluding Wales)     1085 (1.56% p.r.) 03.06.2020 UK Pillar 1 (plus Pillar 2 for Wales)      585 (1.53% p.r.)\n03.06.2020 UK Pillar 2 (excluding Wales)     1286 (1.36%) The positivity rate thus has remained more or less constant on a low level between 1.3% and 1.9% for the last four days on report (with a potential weekend effect not clear, but probably in Sundays' reports for Saturdays' activity). One will have to watch, whether there will show up an expected significant effect of the end of the lockdown on the positivity rate (maybe an increase to >2.5%) in the next few days.\nThe three most important determinants on the number of daily cases by far will be:\n- the extent to which the daily lab capacity (Pillar 1 & 2) will further increase\n- the extent to which the lab capacity will be utilized: as of 2 June 2020 (date of activity) the lab capacities for Pillar 1 tests have been used by only 60.3% (38,163 out of 63,213 possible tests) and for Pillar 2 tests by 81,7% (94,735 out of 116,000 possible tests)\n- whether or not the Pillars 3 & 4 will at some point in time before 30 June 2020 start to produce confirmed cases which will show up in UK's daily report. Short and simple simulation:\none-off increase of positivity rate to a constant 2% as of next day's figures\none-off increase of lab capacity (proportionate for Pillar 1 & 2) by 20% to constant 75,850 (Pillar 1) and 139,200 (Pillar2) per day as of next day's figures\none-off increase of capacity utilization by 20% for Pillar 1-tests to 72.4% and by 10% for Pillar 2-tests to 89.8% as of next day's figures; ceteris paribus\nThis would leave us with a number of 3,600 new confirmed cases per day, which seems to be reasonable to me as an average over the remaining 27 days left to report until 30 June 2020.\nThis would add 97,200 new cases to the 279,856 cases already known to result in 377,056 total cases as of 30 June 2020, which is of course a good thing (only undetected infections can carry the spread further...), and which would lie comfortably in the middle of the last but one basket.\nHowever small (or large) the adjustments in the simulation are, I must confess they are unfounded and nothing else but my best guess and some kind of a worst case scenario for the UK. From my gut instinct I suggest the Sit Rep 162 will report about 350k to 355k cases on 30 June 2020, which probably corrects for my errors in the oversimplified simulation from neglecting possible effects from double testing and from Pillars 3 & 4."], [691, "2020-06-04T14:01:48Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.96, 0.04, 0.0], ""], [81255, "2020-06-04T12:21:25Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.97, 0.03, 0.0], ""], [27661, "2020-06-04T12:11:42Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.97, 0.03, 0.0], ""], [19127, "2020-06-04T11:06:44Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.94, 0.04, 0.02], ""], [85601, "2020-06-04T09:08:28Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.95, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [86678, "2020-06-04T07:42:55Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.99, 0.01, 0.0], ""], [88970, "2020-06-04T07:04:44Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.8, 0.1], ""], [86796, "2020-06-04T05:12:44Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1034, "2020-06-04T04:18:07Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [87943, "2020-06-04T03:59:54Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [34114, "2020-06-03T23:22:57Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [57778, "2020-06-03T22:40:42Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.97, 0.03, 0.0], ""], [57778, "2020-06-03T22:37:35Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.99, 0.01, 0.0], ""], [86069, "2020-06-03T22:32:33Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.91, 0.09, 0.0], ""], [87310, "2020-06-03T21:48:01Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.82, 0.18, 0.0], ""], [86246, "2020-06-03T21:45:53Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [14107, "2020-06-03T21:00:33Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.95, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [88783, "2020-06-03T20:45:04Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.79, 0.2, 0.01], ""], [87175, "2020-06-03T20:38:28Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.55, 0.4, 0.05], ""], [88576, "2020-06-03T20:28:17Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.7, 0.29, 0.01], "https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/uk/"], [86910, "2020-06-03T20:27:30Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.9, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [20504, "2020-06-03T20:24:18Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.67, 0.33, 0.0], "+5% to 260-340, -5% to 340-420"], [1333, "2020-06-03T18:36:14Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.34, 0.65, 0.01], ""], [86554, "2020-06-03T17:27:01Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [79069, "2020-06-03T16:39:34Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], "Just about back on track, after pronounced drop in last few weeks\n315-340K"], [79069, "2020-06-03T16:25:51Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.95, 0.05, 0.0], "Just about back on track, after pronounced drop in last few weeks\n315-340K"], [86429, "2020-06-03T16:17:17Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.86, 0.14, 0.0], "seven day rolling average c2,000 now and declining even with further testing.

Given current trends, which are slightly negative, in new cases using a 14 day avg (currently -4% daily for the last two weeks) it is getting increasingly difficult to believe that total cases will exceed 340k by the end of June.

These is very little correlation between new tests and new cases in an environment where a large one-off increase in tests is performed (https://www.google.com/amp/s/fivethirtyeight.com/features/coronavirus-case-counts-are-meaningless/amp/). So far, high frequency indicators published in major news publications (restaurant reservations, flights, google/apple mobility) show a massive decline in activity that is curbing the spread. Although the UK gov is expected to release a reopening plan this week, it will likely be slow and will have to combat consumer reticence. The jury is still out on how states and countries with aggressive reopening plans are fairing. In terms of item 3, studies in Germany and New York found that COVID-19 was more widely spread than testing indicated, but still only 25-50% of what is need for herd immunity.  Based on the factors above, I think that the naive model might give a fair representation of what will happen with some buffer between the upper and lower bound of the question and the model output. I think risks are skewed to the upside given uncertainties around the re-opening plan in the UK and case surges due to reopening in other areas. Consumer behavior however could offset these risks.

If we look at the graph of confirmed cases at <https://www.ft.com/coronavirus-latest&gt;, there is a lot of dispersion for the rates of decrease of new infections after a peak is reached.  In China it halved in a handful of days, if you can believe their data.  But Australia, New Zealand, and Austria have also seen rapid falloff in new cases once the peak was reached.  Spain, Germany, Italy, and France have fallen more slowly. The UK hasn't yet seen much of a decrease in new cases, i.e., the curve has been pretty flat.

Germany has acted relatively quickly and effectively, and within four weeks daily cases have dropped to approx 30%. The UK has acted less quickly and successfully, and is unlikely to achieve better than halving numbers within 4wks from the peak, more in line with Italy or Spain. It is also troubled by a number of issues: a stressed NHS service, significant lack of PPE, and very low levels of testing.  While daily cases should then continue to decline, this will be partly offset by two things: an increase in testing, and a gradual relaxation of lockdown measures  (Gov. to review 2nd wk of May). Also a perception that we are over the worst could also lead to a slight complacency depending on age/circumstances. The Government will be balancing the easing of restrictions with a clear guide that numbers are substantially lower, but will definitely be under pressure to relax measures in some way before end of May.

It feels to me like there are a couple of big picture scenarios to consider. One, we have and keep this under control - effective social distancing and or contact tracing allows Government to essentially control the number of daily cases to keep the NHS from being overwhelmed. We then essentially have a choice about the trade off between the number of cases and the \"economic\" and other harm people are concerned about. We can either attempt to kill the virus as something spreading in the UK by keeping really strict measures in place - in that case, let's say we have 3k cases per day for the next 10 days, 2k cases per day for the following 10 and then sub 100 for the following 48 - that keeps us in the sub 180k bucket, but if it is even 3.5k for the next 10 days 2,750 for the following 15 and 200 for the remaining 43, that gets us above 180k. Let's say if we did choose to go down that route, we would have 75% chance of staying sub 180k and 25% chance of ending up in the 180-260k bucket. Then let's say we choose to focus more on opening things up. Let's say as above, cases gradually drop to 2k but then we allow them to stay there, that generally gets us in the 180 - 260k cases, but if misjudged a little and end up with 2.5k cases for the last 30 days on average, that gets us in the 260 - 340k bucket and even if we overrun quite a bit but still manage to get the lid back on if things go really wrong, we probably manage to keep within that bucket. However, if we \"lose control\" and get back on an exponential curve and get uncontrolled spreading, we could easily exceed the 420k cases (and that is probably more likely than the 340 - 420k cases range in that instance). So let's say if we go down that route, we are talking about a 40% chance of ending up in the 180 - 260k bucket (i.e. keeping it under control), 50% a slight misjudgement (260 - 340k) and 10% out of control (420k+). Between the try to crush it and try to have some controlled spread, I think we are probably 25/75. Putting those all together gives me 19% in sub 180k, 36% in 180-260k, 38% in 260-340k and 8% in 420k. Let's say there is also a 5% chance this is a false dawn and it is then going to be a real struggle, so we are 50/50 between 340 - 420k (i.e. things go up but we do get them back under control relatively quickly) and 420k plus (big struggle). HOWEVER, one thing I do not want to miss is that we could well start to see a real increase in testing as part of these containment measures.

Due to the low numbers of tests conducted (~10,000 per day, lab capacity for 100,000 per day) [1], the official numbers do not reflect the actual spread of the virus.  The case numbers could already have reached most of the brackets provided here [3]. Currently, only those with severe symptoms are tested. Those people with mild or no symptoms have not been tested and I guess they won't be tested after they have recovered*. Thus, the forecast is much more concerned with those that show severe conditions than with the actual number of people infected - as capacities (and regulations) do not allow for testing a high number of people with mild symptoms at the moment. The UK government wants to test 100,000 people per day at the beginning of May. They may relax the limitations on who gets tested as a consquence. By then, however, most of the people who did not suffer from severe conditions will have recovered obscuring the actual case numbers. Therefore, the following aspects seem particularly relevant for this forecast: - the reproduction number (Is it getting lower than 1? Or will there be ongoing supply of infected people?) [2]\n- recovery rates of infected people with mild or no symptoms (Will there be a smaller pool of people that could potentially be tested?)\n- testing capacity (will we see these 100,000 tests per day?)\n- the guidelines regulating the testing (are more people eligible to testing?)\n- UK government's policy on lockdown and other preventive measures [3] Looking at the numbers, I don't think we'll see a reduction of numbers below 2k per day on average before June (compare to Italy and Spain that still register approximately or more than 3k cases per day). There are ~10 weeks left.  * I may be blindsided by antibody tests here but I know too little about the requirements and capacities needed to perform them in large numbers and I assume they'll receive increased attention as soon as the reproduction number is low enough and priorities shift towards getting back to a more \"normal\" life.

The answer to this question directly correlates to the answer we will give here.  As of the 18/4/2020 Spain and Italy are reporting 190,000 and 172,000 cases respectively. My previous forecasts have been accurately based using these countries as base rates.  So will the UK be able to introduce mass testing to identify previously infected / now immune individuals in 73 days time? How would this be achieved, recorded and effected (logistics, infrastructure etc?). What benefit would there be (return to work, identify at risk, prevent second and third rise, herd immunity identification)? What would be the cost vs the benefit - ALARP (as low as reasonably possible).
