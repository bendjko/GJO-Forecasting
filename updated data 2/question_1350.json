However, I disagree a bit on the categories broadly, and I have a conceptual concern as well.  Broadly, I think the only candidates who may withdraw during this period are Juli\u00e1n Castro, Michael Bennet, Steve Bullock, John Delaney, Wayne Messam, Joe Sestak, Marianne Williamson, Beto O\u2019Rourke, and Tulsi Gabbard.  Given that the other candidates have qualified for the November 20th debate, there is no reason for them to call it quits (assuming no health issues). Debates are free press, free time to get ones name out, time to pander to the party, and, broadly, help yourself out going forward. I think it is highly likely Beto and Tulsi make the threshold and even if they don't I think they will stick around given how conceptually wide open the race is. In addition, it seems from this article [1] that these candidates have until November 13th to try to get enough support to make the cut-off. That means that failing to do so only gives Beto and Tulsi one week to quit.  My conceptual concern, is that conditional on one candidate retiring, I think the probability of other candidates retiring goes way up. Even if we expect 1 or 2 to retire each month on average, I would expect it to come in bunches, 3 one month, 0 the next. This is because a candidate retiring illustrates that donors are pulling back for fringe candidates or DNC is pressuring candidates to quit or whatever. These factors should affect all candidates, not just one.  So, I think the most likely scenario is no candidate quits during this period. If one quits, I think it is likely a few will. My one concern is that Castro seems to be playing a different game than the other candidates so I think it is also definitely possible he calls it quits and no one else does (hence one to two being greater than three to four). But, if one of the fringe candidates quits, I will shift most of my weight to three or four rather than to one or two.
