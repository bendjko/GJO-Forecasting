I leave room for an increase in rates (10%) because there is always uncertainty in any situation, particularly where economics is involved. We are never quite sure when military action against another country will be taken or when the next natural disaster will decimate a local economy, etc.  The factors that played into my forecast are as follows:\n1. Inflation in the US is and has been consistently low. However, inflation for the 12 month period ending in December 2019 left inflation at 2.3%, slightly over the Fed's goal of maintaining 2% inflation rate (a slight increase from the 2.1% rate seen prior to 2019). This factor played more heavily into my 10% forecast of the Fed raising rates.  2. China and the U.S. signed Phase I of a trade deal. This means that, to our knowledge, there will be no additional tariffs placed on goods in the future. Lately there has been a lot of talk in the media regarding recession fears, but a trade deal is a good signal to investors that the situation is improving.  3. The Fed has signaled in its last FOMC meeting in December 2019 that it does not expect the rate to change in 2020. More overt signaling like this played heavily into my 60% forecase of no rate change. The Fed is forecasting lower growth in 2020, however my perception is that economics are not quick to make radical changes when teh outcomes of their previous rate changes are not clear. With the Fed even hinting at adding negative interest rates to its toolbox, I think it highly unlikely that they will RAISE rates but wary of the consequences that negative interest rates bring.  4. Lastly, if the Fed is forecasting slower growth in 2020 for the US economy, it is possible that they could further lower rates if the economy spirals downward into a recession. This would increase lending and provide further boosts to the stock market to keep investors happy and spending. Inflation isn't at a high enough rate that it would cause worry amongst most economists (I don't think), so a temporary decrease may be the answer to lower growth.
