The Tibetan force deployments in the Ladakh theatre, in fact, began soon after the Chinese incursions in May this year.

One is generally thought to be a rising superpower (India) one is arguably there already (China) Not only are they strongly incentivized to avoid coming into open warfare, every other significant actor in world politics is incentivized to keep them from coming into open warfare as well. Likely there\u2019s a lot of behind the scenes diplomacy we are not seeing with the goal of preventing said war.\nPrevious border disputes between China and India have typically followed a pattern of clashes followed by de-escalation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Indian_border_dispute) Chinese official media have not made much of the incident. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_China%E2%80%93India_skirmishes). To me, this indicates that the Chinese government is not interested in pursuing further belligerence; if they were they would be rallying support from their people. There\u2019s always the possibility of change in policy due to opaque dynamics within the party, but I believe this to be unlikely. Xi Jinping seems secure in his power and will probably not be swayed by fire-eaters. Modi, likewise, enjoys strong approval ratings (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi#Personal_life_and_image) and does not seem like he is vulnerable to being pressured into highly aggressive action. His reputation as a nationalist and his previous aggressive action in Jammu and Kashmir give him a certain freedom of maneuver here. On the other hand: Although both sides have taken steps to reduce their troop presence in the reason, it looks like India is is committed to developing their infrastructure in the region (https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-53171124). This is unlikely to put China at ease. On the whole, I think we can probably expect tensions on the border to increase rather than decrease over the next decade.  It\u2019s possible that I have actually inverted the relationship between Modi\u2019s political base and his freedom of maneuver. It could be that having made his reputation as a hardliner, he feels compelled to live up to it and escalates the situation. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case but I\u2019m obviously an expert on Indian politics. \n"], [49838, "2020-07-31T02:38:05Z", [0.0], "The way this question is worded, it skirts right around the event that happened in mid June of this year, so, now, nearly no chance of this happening again."], [88209, "2020-07-31T02:09:13Z", [0.15], "Some more troop movements and not complete withdrawal raises possibility of a random confrontation"], [29646, "2020-07-31T01:39:36Z", [0.1], "As long as they\u2019re talking, less than likely.\nhttps://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-china-border-dispute-pangong-gogra-army-6531667/"], [90801, "2020-07-31T01:36:48Z", [0.5], "new troops are currently being deployed by both sides, where tensions appeared to ease they are instead ramping up"], [57628, "2020-07-31T01:18:51Z", [0.01], ""], [85986, "2020-07-31T00:42:01Z", [0.4], ""], [86554, "2020-07-31T00:26:48Z", [0.21], ""], [90912, "2020-07-30T16:16:52Z", [0.5], ""], [74903, "2020-07-30T14:32:10Z", [0.55], ""], [27661, "2020-07-30T09:55:48Z", [0.04], ""], [93068, "2020-07-30T08:34:04Z", [0.08], ""], [14107, "2020-07-29T19:42:31Z", [0.09], ""], [90801, "2020-07-29T19:37:39Z", [0.1], "recent conflicts appear to have abated vs increased"], [31275, "2020-07-29T15:52:59Z", [0.06], ""], [92665, "2020-07-29T12:35:40Z", [0.03], ""], [42097, "2020-07-29T09:44:36Z", [0.08], ""], [94638, "2020-07-28T21:36:34Z", [0.01], ""], [3429, "2020-07-28T20:38:00Z", [0.1], "maintaining current forecast"], [89064, "2020-07-28T18:31:33Z", [0.2], "Incremental update.

As stated in the analysis, the single biggest possible factor leading to conflict was the possibility of a local misunderstanding leading to an uncontrolled escalation in-situ. The disengagement of personnel in the area massively reduces that likelihood and allows room for diplomatic management. In the absence of any further flare-ups, I would expect this probability to steadily decrease over time.] [Update 24/06/20]\n[Probability reduced 45->43% in response to news that India/China have reached a provisional agreement on a staged disengagement (https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-china-border-disengagement-galwan-faceoff-6472274/). The risk of local-level miscalculation remains, but this early-stage agreement indicates a mutual willingness to de-escalate.] Note: Technically this question doesn\u2019t refer to the LAC specifically, so could apply to anywhere.\nUltimately this is a gut feeling estimate rather than a more quantifiable metric. Given that 15 June was the first fatal clash in 45 years there is no reliable statistical soure to base estimates on the number of annual clashes vs the number that escalate to fatalities. 15 June was the first fatal incident between India & China in 45 years. The most recent conflict precipitated by Chinese forces objecting to India road construction in Galwan River valley (undisputed Indian territory, but Chinese don\u2019t like the strategic implications). Fighting on 15/16 June resulted in 20 Indian dead and some Chinese casualties. China claims that \u201cIndian border troops have unilaterally and continuously built roads, bridges and other facilities at the LAC in the Galwan Valley\u201d. China have themselves been pitching tents in a disputed area of the Galwan Valley; this is reportedly part of a Chinese pattern, whereby they pitch tents, then move back after bilateral military-talks, but do not remove or destroy the tents. Positive modifiers (Strategic):\nChina is raising border issues due to internal problems within China and the international pressure being exerted on China over COVID-19.\nCurrent border tensions have been linked to India's decision to abrogate Article 370 and change the status of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019.\nPLA has brought in 6000 extra troops\nIn response to the first incident India has sent 12,000 additional workers to help complete development of infrastructure.\nChina captured 60 km2 of Indian-patrolled territory between May and June 2020. Will India try to regain this? Positive modifiers (Local):\nIndia has loosened its Rules of Engagement, sanctioning use of firearms in \u2018extraordinary\u2019 circumstances. The Indian Army have been given full freedom to deal with on-ground situation.\nIndia has something to prove, \u2018blood raised\u2019 on both sides. Any ground interactions between patrols could easily escalate to fatal clashes unintentionally. Negative modifiers (Strategic):\nChina has (largely) achieved its goal, pushing gaining 60 km2 of Indian territory. A period of consolidation to allow tensions to cool would be strategically sensible.\nNumerous Indian government officials said that border tensions will not impact trade between India and China despite some Indian campaigns about boycotting Chinese products. This appears part of a wider intent within the Indian government to prevent further strategic escalation. My estimate leans towards no for all of the reasons above, with the primary reasons being due to China having largely achieved their strategic goals, and India largely being unwilling to escalate to a true inter-state conflict. The residual risk therefore (whilst significant) is due to the potential for local escalation between patrols rather than larger scale strategies on either side.

Checking the twitter account of Shiv Aroor, he points out [1] that in July 1962 the Chinese troops left a post in the Galwan Valley, just three months before the 1962 war [2]. In short, the current de-escalation could be merely temporary too. However all this depends on the reasons behind the diplomatic agreement between China and India, which are not clear to me. According to the argumentation of Wang Jian, a Chinese political commentator  I follow on Youtube [3], there might be three reasons why China has decided to abandon the post in the Galwan valley: 1) A miscalculation of the Chinese intelligence and its analysts, who did not foresee the determination of India in that matter (apparently the visit of Modi to Ladakh did make an impression on China)\n2) Too many fronts open right now for the Chinese diplomacy: besides India, recently there has been a really weird nationalistic claim for Vladivostok in the Chinese internet [4] (this totally is a \"WFT, seriously?\" moment) , Xinjiang and of course Hong Kong.\n3) India threatening not to join RCEP [5] (important if we take into account the current state of the Chinese economy). So I guess that it boils down to how strong are these (and other) reasons as an incentive to avoid further confrontation, because obviously the Chinese did not began building tents in the Galwan valley for enjoying a summer picnic in the mountains. According to Maroof Raza, a retired Indian army officer, control of the Galwan Valley and the Depsang plains (also along the LAC) could allow the construction of a road that will shorten the route to the Shaksgam valley [6], where there are lots of glaciers.

However it is also likely that the Chinese notice the Indian army patrolling nearby and decided to attack, which knowing the Chinese psychology would not have been surprising either. Basically, the Indians obviously do not want the Chinese building a camp in disputed territory and the Chinese want to show the Indians that they are the top dog in Asia (obviously, this theory is popular in India). Assuming that the Chinese attacked, I wonder how the Indians plan to deal with the situation: obviously, a Chinese camp there would be probably followed by more constructions, then maybe try to change the course of the river and all these tactics. But the Chinese army is in theory better prepared. Yet, owing to the terrain, any advantage that the Chinese army may have will probably amount to nothing, which probably means that around there there's no better army. With these, I was originally thinking of a 35% probability of the clash going on. But now apparently the Chinese are leaving the little camp they built [1]. Apparently India has been doing something at the diplomatic level. Thus I will reduce it to a 10% probability.

Quote 'the border dispute flared into a war. China won conclusively'.\n- Method of attack is interesting (from same article): India protested. On June 6, Indian and Chinese military officers started talks to de-escalate the crisis. The Chinese agreed to vacate some positions. On the evening of June 15, an Indian Army patrol set out to verify whether the Chinese had withdrawn from positions on the Indian side of the Line of Actual Control. According to the Indian officials, the Chinese had not withdrawn as agreed, and several hundred Chinese soldiers ambushed the Indian patrol. The Chinese claim they were on their own side of the Line of Actual Control when the Indian soldiers crossed over and attacked them. While both Indian and Chinese soldiers carry weapons when they patrol the border, it has been a longstanding practice, in accordance with agreements signed by the two countries in 1996 and 2005, not to use firearms during patrol clashes. Brutal hand-to-hand fighting followed in which the Chinese killed at least 20 Indian soldiers , pushing some of the wounded over the steep cliffs overlooking the Galwan River. - Conclusion:\nAt present, I am thinking between now and 30 Sep, both sides will aggressively build infrastructure. India will be keen to expand territory which may increase likelihood of retaliation/ further confrontation as time goes on. Side note: I must admit that the inclusion of militia in the question does make it more probable for a response from India, however, I have concluded with the increased military numbers in the area who will be keen to control any non-governmental retaliation and with COVID-19 worries, it will be difficult for any militia to insert itself, despite their probable need for 'revenge'.

It seems highly unlikely that there will be deaths resulting from fists or blunt weapons, although the forecast needs to be adjusted for the unlikely scenario of a lucky strike to the head. The recent border disputes have started since XJP and Modi came to power (2013 for XJP, 2014 for Modi). Both are seen as nationalists and strongmen who want to build their internal base up while maintaining a strong exterior to the world. This mentality has fueled the disputes over the past 5 years, although stopping short of ordering troops to attack each other with non-blunt weapons to prevent a regional war. Border disputes started in 2013 when XJP took power and wanted to exert control over China's military through a show of force (https://www.theatlantic.com/china/archive/2013/05/are-china-and-india-about-to-fight-over-their-border/275518/). 2014, 2015, 2017 clashes seemed to be about small incursions from construction equipment into disputed territory and usually ahead of Indo-Sino summits. In 2020, China has ramped up its national security policies. All other nations except for US have not reacted strongly to the new nationalistic push by XJP.

China has more license to be aggressive due to the pandemic and military superiority and some in India/China will want retaliation.  Troops from both sides are building up on the 'line of actual control'. They will be briefed to only fire if fired upon.

Reasons why I give this a lower probability than the crowd is:\n1) China seems to have achieved their desired result (claim on Gaiwan/embarrass India), and would be happy to sit and watch\n2) India would be wary of escalating the situation (with domestic issues) and would be happy to claim stalemate The reason why I give this 35% is because of the heightened tensions and the domestic calls of revenge from India.
