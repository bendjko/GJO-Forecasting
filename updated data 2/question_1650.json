First let's begin by calculating a base rate. The US Cabinet has 15 executive level members, of those, 3 have been turned over this year, giving us a Year 3 base rate of 20 percent. I'm using Year 3 here as opposed to year 4 because it gives us our first non-zero probability. Total turnover across the four years is 10 out of 15 positions being turned over at least once which yields a rate of 66 percent. So we can say with a reasonable degree of certainty that the probability of Esper deparitng before August 5, 2020 is somewhere between 20 and 66 percent. This gives us a starting range. It is worth noting that more of the range (30) lies on the negative side versus the positive side (16), assuming our range is correct. (Figures calculate on basis of Brookings Institute analysis linked by Leonardthethird) [1] Now let's look at some specifics. of the 10 resignations from the Trump Cabinet, 8 have resigned under pressure or protest.  Let's say this raises the probability of a resignation since Espers is certainly under pressure and there are rumors per Politico [2] that a list of potential replacements is being drawn up. Let's say we give resignation the edge for the sake of argument at 55 percent. Let's also introduce the time element-before August 5. At time of writing that's two months away. Defense Secretaries in Trump's Cabinet (acting and permanet have served an average of 205 days (See Wikipedia page for US Secretary of Defense, the chart at the bottom)[3]. Esper is now over that threshold at 320 days). Keep in mind that his last and only permanent predecessor under Trump lasted 710 days. For my  purposes I'll assume Esper can last another two months, bringing us to a 49 percent probability - just on the edge of no. But what if Trump gets upset and decides a head must roll. Here we have to consider the various ways this might be accomplished Esper could resign under pressure, the most common outcome for Cabinet departure at 70%, he could be fired, or he could simply be frozen out of any meaningful power or role yet remain SecDef, a possibility put foward in the in the linked Politico article as Trump's preferred method for silencing internal critics. Let's say that this is the most likely scenario and push our forecast slightly more firmly in the no category at 44 percent. CNN reports that Esper has refused to testify about the military's role in the Floyd protests, perhaps a sign that he is closing ranks and trying to appease Trump.[4] Has he learned his lesson where Trump is concerned? Maybe. Will it be enough to save his job. It's certainly a good effort and shows he's trying to be an astute political operator. Not exactly the behavior of someone who is about to resign or maybe a last attempt to save face in front of the President. Hard to say. With that said I'm taking a final position at 39 percent.  Just at the top end of \"Probably Not\" according to Sherman Kent's probability scale.
