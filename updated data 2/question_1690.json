Today, FB closed at $245.42. There are 12 remaining trading days before August 5th. Given expected daily volatility of 1-2%, a base rate of 60% can be assumed, implying that FB is roughly equally likely to increase or decrease in value before the 5th of August. Our final prediction shouldn\u2019t stray too far from this value either, as markets are generally efficient, and I am by no means an expert in FB stock. There are a few important events to highlight that will strongly influence Facebook stock. On 7/29, after market close, FB will release earnings. EPS expectations are lower that any of the past four quarters, due to new headwinds facing adverting revenues. The company has been subject to an advertiser boycott due to the not policing the veracity of content on the platform more closely, and not removing hate speech. Earnings will likely have a large impact on whether or not the stock price is up or down on the time interval considered.  Currently, we are in the midst of earnings season. Twitter reports earnings on 7/23. Snap reports on 7/21. Apple and Amazon report on 7/30. These are all events that could affect the stock price of FB, positively or negative depending on if industry trends are elucidated.  Finally, the federal reserve will report Q2 GDP figures on 7/30. This is likely to have a large impact on all equities. The median forecast is currently -31% (according to marketwatch) compared to the same quarter last year. This will potentially depress stocks further as retail investors respond to this news. Assuming a binomial pricing model, and daily volatility of 1.5%, in 2510/4096 (61%) cases the price of FB stock is above 240.86 by 8/5. The 8/7 245 straddle is trading at $23.10, (this accounts for 14 trading days, not 12). A fine estimate is that the straddle at the current stock price for expiry on 8/5 would be trading at about $20. (In 50% of cases, the stock price would remain within $20 from the stock price).
