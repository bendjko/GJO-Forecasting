This is largely due to the fact that interest rates on the 10-yr reflect future expectations for inflation. If growth and inflation are expected to slow (a recession), then the 10-yr falls. Meanwhile, if the Fed is still hiking rates, the 2-yr rises and the curve inverts. Structural factors keeping inflation low have prevented this from occurring. now to the elephant in the room - coronavirus and it's impact on bond yields. When looking at the yield curve since January (https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=yieldYear&year=2020) yields have certainly plummeted, but the move seems to be mostly parallel with the 2-10 spread not changing much. Rabobank did a study in 2016 where they looked at different factors that affect the yield curve (https://services.rabobank.com/publicationservice/download/publication/token/A90yi2feIba60IkcVftD) - particularly the 2-10 spread. They looked at 4 variables (Fed Funds Rate, VIX, Non-farm Payrolls, and CPI) and found that changes in the Fed Funds rate affect the 2-yr more than the 10-yr (higher beta). They also found that inflation affects the 10-yr more than the 2-yr. Impact of NFP was small and the VIX put slightly more downward pressure on the 2 year than the 10 year. In the context of this forecast, this would suggest the following:\n1. IF the Fed cuts rates, the 2 year will fall more than the 10 year \n2. IF inflation (CPI) falls, the 10 year will decline more than the 2 year\n3. IF the VIX stays elevated the 2 year will fall more than the 10 year\n4. The 2 year is more sensitive to NFP than the 10 year My expectation is for the coronavirus to serve primarily as a demand shock in the US. While the supply-chain argument certainly resonates and could be inflationary (factories can't complete and ship goods so prices rise), the US economy is more service-based and demand for many of those services will be down if H-2-H interaction is considered risky. This lack of demand will push prices down and, along with lower energy prices, contribute to lower inflation. Job growth will also likely slow if cases continue to grow in the US. While higher job growth has not proven to raise inflation, I think declining job growth will push it down further. Going back to the Rabobank study, the biggest drivers of an inversion would be either the Fed not cutting, CPI falling, or a combination of the two. The market is already pricing in aggressive Fed action (https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html) and while inflation might not materially pick up, the energy component of CPI should rebound. Before 5/1, the situation will either dramatically improve or the Fed will act. After that, warmer weather should send coronavirus the same way as the seasonal flu (https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/02/12/805256402/can-coronavirus-be-crushed-by-warmer-weather) and the \"cautious reflation\" narrative resumes as the world realizes nothing is materially different but macro risks related to trade and policy still persist"], [75794, "2020-02-29T20:38:07Z", [0.4, 0.35, 0.1, 0.1, 0.05], ""], [78597, "2020-02-29T18:42:18Z", [0.15, 0.25, 0.35, 0.0, 0.25], ""], [11430, "2020-02-29T17:56:38Z", [0.15, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.7], ""], [38094, "2020-02-29T17:41:54Z", [0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0], "Hattip @noob22 for analysis, but I'll bias toward sooner rather than later.
