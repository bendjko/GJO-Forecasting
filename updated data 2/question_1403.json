Background: The two major political parties in Taiwan are the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Kuomintang (KMT).  A smaller party that fields a presidential candidate for the 2020 election is the People First Party (PFP). KMT is the political party that ruled China before the Communists won and took over China.  After retreated to Taiwan in 1949, KMT has ruled Taiwan for many years. In the old days, KMT declared the Taiwan is part of the Republic of China (ROC) and it is the legitimate ruler of China. It follows the slogan \u201cthere is only one China\u201d and someday China will unite under the banner of KMT.  Strangely enough, currently KMT is friendlier towards \u201cCommunist China\u201d (the People\u2019s Republic of China).     DPP was formed after the liberalization of politics in Taiwan in 1980\u2019s. While not advocating publicly for the independence of Taiwan, its policies are more independently minded and less friendly towards China.  The current Taiwan president is Tsai from DPP. She won in the last election (2016), defeating the KMT candidate by a large margin (56 versus 30) [1].  However, DPP encountered a huge setback in the 2018 local elections [2], mostly due to economic issues.  Its loss includes the election of Han Kuo-yu (KMT) as the mayor of Kaohsiung, a stronghold for DPP.  Han since has become the KMT presidential candidate for the 2020 election. 2020 election: Initially it appears that DPP would lose in the upcoming 2020 presidential election.  Early polls (up to about the end of April 2019) show Han leading Tsai by about 50 to 35 [3].  However, the poll numbers started to change in July 2019.  Over the months, Tsai\u2019s poll numbers gradually turned around to lead Han by 45 to 30 [3].   Indeed, the latest poll in November has Tsai leading by 55 to 25 [4]. The turning around for Tsai (DPP) coincides with the increasingly violent pro-democratic protests in Hong Kong.  The violent police crackdown and the rigid responses from the governments in Hong Kong and China expose the delusion of the \u201cone country, two system\u201d motto.  The events in Hong Kong reveal to the Taiwanese that living under the imposition of Taiwan being part of China and \u201cone country, two system\u201d motto could just mean living under the dictatorship of Communist China.  The fear of Communist China helps to elevate DPP\u2019s (and Tsai\u2019s) poll numbers.   Recent events also help the DPP.  The report of Chinese spy trying to infiltrate the Australian Parliament [5], and the arrest of 2 local company executives for spying for China [6] highlighted the attempt of China in influencing the politics in Taiwan.  The landslide victory by pro-democracy forces in the Hong Kong local election [7] highlights the hope for opposing totalitarianism.   \n\nChina is not going to change its totalitarian ways.  So my forecast is Tsai\u2019s poll numbers will continue to rise and she will win the election in January 2020.\n\n[1]  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Taiwan_presidential_election\n[2]  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Taiwanese_municipal_elections\n[3]  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2020_Taiwan_general_election\n[4]  https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3824398\n[5]  https://www.npr.org/2019/11/26/782867301/china-wanted-a-spy-in-australias-parliament-reports-say\n[6]  https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/25/world/asia/taiwan-china-spying-elections.html\n[7]  https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/24/asia/hong-kong-district-council-elections-intl/index.html\n"], [18679, "2019-11-28T15:21:34Z", [0.99, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2019-11-28T14:26:53Z", [0.94, 0.06, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [19801, "2019-11-28T05:46:23Z", [0.75, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0], "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2020_Taiwan_general_election Latest poll shows DPP ahead of KMT by 10%\nTaiwan President Tsai Ing-wen leads Han Kuo-yu by 29 percentage points: Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation\nhttps://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3824398"], [79851, "2019-11-28T02:57:41Z", [0.9, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2019-11-27T19:51:20Z", [0.85, 0.1, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [73436, "2019-11-27T18:14:28Z", [0.7, 0.2, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2019-11-27T17:20:38Z", [0.75, 0.2, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [79338, "2019-11-27T13:39:06Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [27661, "2019-11-27T12:13:15Z", [0.97, 0.03, 0.0, 0.0], "Reduced the probability for a win by Han after comparing the current opinion polls with those polls four years ago.

She won in a landslide in 2016 [1], garnering ~56% of the vote in a three-way race (the other candidates received 31% and 13%).  She is again in a three-way race [2] and recent polling (there are four polls from the past ten days that reflect this three-way race) has her winning, on average, ~42% of the vote. This is compared to an average of ~25% for Han Kuo-yu and ~8% for James Soong [3]. Also, news has literally just broke that a Chinese spy has defected to Australia and has released a trove of information on China's foreign influence operations - a key target of which has been Taiwan and its upcoming presidential election [4]. This is huge news (as such a defection seems to have never happened before) and it is sure to work in President Ing-wen's favor, as she is seen as more hawkish on China than her opponents. This will likely hurt Kuo-yu, who is second in the polls, since the defector seems to have indicated that China's influence operation has been working to advance his candidacy. And, of course, the ongoing Hong Kong protests probably also help President Ing-wen - but I assume that this is already reflected in the polling since the polling is recent.
