The ANC's share of votes in local elections has declined to about 54% since 2016 following these controversies as party supporters either opt out of voting or support opposition parties like the Economic Freedom Fighters; however, there has been no data to suggest that a significant percentage of ANC party supporters have switched their support to these opposition groups (https://worldin2019.economist.com/southafricaselection). Following President Zuma's removal from power, Cyril Ramaphosa has been working to restore the party and the office of the president by criticizing those who supported Zuma. Although Zuma is supported among poor and rural factions who may be resurgent during this election cycle, it is very likely that Ramaphosa will win in South Africa's next election because the majority of black voters will not desert the party associated with Nelson Mandela and the abolition of apartheid (https://www.cfr.org/blog/despite-challenges-south-africas-anc-likely-remain-power).

Most recent poll has the ANC at 61%. Taking into account all 2019 polls, weighted by sample size, we get 58.8%. These should take into account corruption and scandals, at least better than I could by myself.  2014 Feb/Mar polling by Ipsos predicted the end result fairly well. [3] If anything, polls seemed to have underestimated the end result. Given the strong base rate and no recent poll even close to below 50%, I estimate the probability at 3%. Currently, the end result seems very close to 60%, so probability mass seems roughly equal between the other two options. Base rate and most recent polling seem to be better predictors to me than previous polling or \"inside view\" arguments. Polls seemed to have underestimated.

[1] However, their support peaked in 2004 and has declined by about 4% each election.\nYear\tANC\n1994\t62.65\n1999\t66.35\n2004\t69.69\n2009\t65.9\n2014\t62.15 2) The polling data analysis done by @sreichau is spot on. I went back a little further in the polls which put my numbers at 8.55%,  69.80%, and  21.60% for the <50%, 50-60%, and >60% brackets, respectively. [2] 3) The DA party has gained about 4.5% of the vote in each election since 1999.

However, much like many other nations, SA has a big voter apathy problem and the number of registered voters didn't seem to change much since the last election, [4] meaning that support for the DA (or any other opposition party) would have to come from ANC defectors. This puts me squarely at 50/50 for the 50-60% and >60% brackets. Since 50/50 is the same probability of flipping a coin (and I would like to think that I can do better than that, maybe?), I'm starting with 0%, 63%, and 37%.
