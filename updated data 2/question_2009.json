The dispute comes down to the US objecting how Canada taxes harvests and seeing this as an unfair subsidy. Current tariff is around 9%.  An important thing to consider is the effect of lumber cost on house prices. High lumber prices currently add between 24k and 36k to the price of a new house (costing 408,8K in 2021) (2). eliminating the tariff would decrease new house prices by about 0,5% to 0,7% depending on the amount of wood used. Significant given the amount of money needed to buy a house but I'm wondering how much effect removing a 9% tariff will have on lumber prices increasing in the double of even triple digits. Bidens record on trade policy also isn't that different from Trump when it comes to protecting US jobs and industries. (3) On the other hand, it would be a vote pleaser for Biden and the pressure to do something about rising house prices is increasing (4).  I'm going with 65% on this one. Although the effect of a reduction in tariffs will be limited and it wont solve the underlying issue of Canadian subsidies, there is mounting pressure to do (or be seen doing) something about high house prices.
