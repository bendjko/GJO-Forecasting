It was a historic win, but in many ways it could be deemed a fluke and was not nearly demanding enough to suggest he is a sure thing this time around. Before him, Republicans had kept the seat since 1980, meaning the district is not blue. It has also swung red in every election since 2000, including both of Obama's terms, suggesting that it is not historically purple either. The Dems have an incumbent advantage here and a substantially larger war chest, but I hesitate to predict that means they've secured the win this early.
