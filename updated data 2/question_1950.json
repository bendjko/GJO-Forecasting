This seems to be the crucial point that prompted this question. The announcement by the CSA has confirmed CGTN broadcasting to be under the jurisdiction of France, under the Financial Times view, it should now be able to broadcast into Council of Europe territories.  On the other hand, the details of this question says the \"Financial Times has reported that CGTN approached French regulators in December 2020 about seeking a license to broadcast in France, which could return CGTN to the UK and elsewhere\". It's not clear whether \"license\" here is equated with confirming that CGTN falls under the jurisdiction of France and hence is able to broadcast in France. If it did mean the same thing, it would match the view in the FT article. If it doesn't, I don't know what else it can refer to.

For this, no need for a specific license, according to French law, as recalled by the CSA. It suffices to fulfill two technical conditions: to be broadcast on a French satellite and to transmit a signal from France. Editorial criteria are not taken into account. However, CGTN fulfills these two conditions. \u201cThe channel is broadcast by several Eutelsat satellites, and in particular through its pan-European satellite. And the signal is emitted from France, \u201dconfirms a spokesperson for the company.

It's hard to understand it through Google translate. Maybe there are some insights I've missed. Generally the message seems to be the CSA is supposed to decide based on technical criteria alone and isn't to judge the political/editorial content of the channel, and that it can only regulate the content after broadcasts. The Wikipedia article also gives me the same impression that the CSA only regulates after broadcasts. I'm not sure though. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conseil_sup%C3%A9rieur_de_l%27audiovisuel Might be kind of weird that I can't find anything new about CGTN on the CSA website. The first article says the issue will be discussed in a meeting on March 3rd, but I can't find references to CGTN on the (Google-translated) agenda: https://www.csa.fr/Informer/Ordres-du-jour-des-assemblees-plenieres/Les-ordres-du-jour-de-mars-2021 Maybe the issue is being described vaguely and without direct references. Protests from an NGO: https://www.fidh.org/en/region/asia/china/ngos-call-on-french-media-regulator-to-reject-the-broadcasting French/European governments seem to be less aggressive to China than Anglosphere governments are. For example, with the EU-China investment deal, 5G networks. France/Europe looks like to be balancing relationships with the Anglosphere and relationships with China so I won't go for a strong \"Yes\" or \"No\".

Brexit does not affect this.\nTherefore, CGTN could overcome the OFCOM rejection as being an arm of the Chinese Communist Party lacking editorial independence (that contravenes UK Law), but local operators would have to agree to carry the broadcaster.
