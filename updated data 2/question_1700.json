I found it should take 23 days from now (sep 3), so we should be below 2500 by sept 26.  To get a sense of sensitivity, I perturbed the daily percent decline up and down by 20%. This would turn my estimate into 19 (sep 22) and 29 days (oct 2) respectively. I'm maybe like 70% confident it will fall in this range (pulled that number out of thin air but it seems alright). Lastly, I'll shift my estimate later by a couple days (let's say 3) to account for the fact that it sounds like Texas governor is likely to loosen restrictions soon (according to quick google search).

However I think I have found the cause: it is the delay between testing and results. 2.a) There is a strong correlation between hospital beds at day N and the number of total weekly cases from day N-offset: Beds(day_n) = factor * (Total_cases(day_n - offset) - Total_cases(day_n - offset -7) ) 2.b) From the NY hospitalization data, offset = 9 worked really well if we wanted to obtain a stable factor. This factor stabilized at about 0.13-0.14 for Texas during mid-July. 2.c) But since them, this factor has been steadily going down, till 0.08 to 0.09 today. And this was totally destabilizing the probabilities. 2.d) However then I thought about the delay in test results, which indicate that the offset needs to be smaller. With offset = 6 or 7, we get again a factor = 0.10 to 0.11 that is stable in time (instead of steadily decreasing in time). 2.e) Redoing the calculation, now we will need the number of weekly cases on the 6 or 7 of September to be below (23-25) K per week. Right now is 34K per week, which requires a geometric decrease below 0.74 within one week. This could happen, but it is not particularly likely, as the geometric decrease factor seems to be hovering around 0.9. But it could happen. However it is more probably a signal to look for than a factor that should change current probabilities. 3) Finally, there could be a change of trend in cases, which will ruin the decrease in hospitalizations. Thus I have included some probability in the \"Not before 4 October\" bucket. 4) For cross-checking my own results (most probable dates): Below 3500 beds: 4 of September\nBelow 3000 beds: 10-12 of September\nBelow 2750 beds: 12-15 of September\nBelow 2500 beds: 15-19 of September If any of these milestones is crossed before the expected date, I should really panic and correct my current predictions.

Let me explain: 1) Bed occupancy evolution: in this case I model the following: Beds(today) = x Beds(today - 7 days) which follows a nice exponential decay pattern. Then I calculate x_mu and x_sigma (the median and the variance) during the last 7, 14 and 21 days, which gives me: x(last 7 days) = 0.837 +/- 0.015\nx(last 14 days) = 0.839 +/- 0.017\nx(last 21 days) = 0.854 +/- 0.029 which are basically compatible at the statistical level (maybe with the exception of the one for the last 21 days). I compare this with the type of exponential decay required for getting 2500 beds on 14 September and 4 October, respectively: x_14Sep = 0.789\nx_04Oct = 0.883 This gives me {0, 0, 1, 84, 15} for the buckets if I used the mean and variance of the last 3 weeks (which has the largest variance). If I use the other two values (previous 1 and 2 weeks), then the probabilities will peak close to 100% in the 14 September to 4 October bucket. 2) New weekly cases: previously, from the NYC hospitalization data [1], it was apparent that there is a strong correlation between total beds occupied and new weekly cases (with a certain offset), i.e. Bed_occupancy (today) = fac * (total_cases(today-offset)  - total_cases(today-offset-7)) where for TX, the factor fac has moved between 0.10 and 0.14 and the best offset seems to be 9. At the same time, the new weekly cases also follows a nice exponential behavior: (total_cases(today-offset)  - total_cases(today-offset-7)) = x_cas * (total_cases(today-offset-7)  - total_cases(today-offset-14)) with x_cas calculable as in the previous cases, giving the following means and variances: x_cas (last 7 days / w offset = 9) = 0.962 +/- 0.051\nx_cas (last 14 days / w offset = 9) = 0.955 +/- 0.054\nx_cas (last 21 days / w offset = 9) = 0.933 +/- 0.060 which is however incompatible with the hospitalization data, though the incompatibility is systematic (basically fac is decreasing with time). This anomalous behavior was noted by @Dillyweed in previous posts. With this, and fac = 0.09 and 0.10 respectively, the buckets are filled as {0,0,0,26,74} and {0,0,0,17,83}, indicating a much larger probability of the last bucket. I will simply average to {0,0,0,21,79} 3) Now the problem is how to combine 1+2. What I have done is give a weight of 0.75 to view 1, and 0.25 to view 2, resulting in my current prediction. That is, I have considered that the behavior of hospitalizations is more fundamental in the time frame of the question than the behavior of the pandemic in Texas. This choice is based on the experience of a previous question about the hospitalization in AZ, but it could be a bad choice. In fact it could be the weak link for my answer to this question: it might very well happen that the key point still is the reduction of the new cases, rather than bed policies.

I have this feeling that something is going on here that I don't understand. The drop has continued linearly for a month. Obviously it cannot continue for another month on this tragectory because that would leave us with negative patients in Texas hospitals. The most likely explanations I can think of are:  1) Texas has gotten a lot better at treating patients and hospital stays have gotten less frequent (as % of cases) and shorter. So my mental model (hospitalizations ~= A x last 10 days of cases) now has a significantly different value for \"A\" on the order of 0.5 instead of 1.0. \n     OR\n2) Texas is transferring less critical patients to SNFs so it isn't apples to apples compared to a few months ago. This would make sense because: \n    -- SNFs are desperate for patients, with capacity utilization at historic lows; \n    -- SNFs and hospitals have figured out how to safely treat COVID+ patients\n    -- Hospitals and the rest of the medical industry want those beds for more profitable patients like knees and hips\n    OR \n3) Systematic re-classification of patients in hospitals either to get better billing rates or for political gain. My guess is that all of those things (except maybe #3) are true to some extent. Still, I think dropping 50% in a month is near the high end of what's feasible. I think that (exponential) is the right way to look at it, not as a linear drop. If that happens again, then we are at just over 2.5k on Sept 20th.  Still, it's possible that it will continue linearly and, if so, then we would hit 2.5k around Sept 5. I just have trouble believing that's likely.

Thus the number of bed occupied in the future is: Beds(n_weeks) = 6632 x^{n_weeks} For being below 2500 by 14 September, we need x < 0.796, for 4 October x < 0.872. The decay since the peak has been in between 0.88-0.92, except for the last few days in which it has suddenly dropped to 0.82-0.84. So not sure which of the two buckets. 2) Bed occupancy as a function of new weekly cases: here the best predictor I could find both from NY and TX hospitalizations is that the total number of beds occupied correlates really well with the number of new weekly cases 9 days before. That is: Bed(today) = f * (TotalCases(today - 9 days ) - TotalCases(today- 16 days)) for TX, f has been relatively stable at 0.14 till a few days ago in which it has dropped to f = 0.12 (well, the problem with the sudden recent drop in occupancy). The number of weekly cases follows a relatively stable exponential fall lately: TotalCases(today) - TotalCases(today - 7) = y (TotalCases(today - 7) - TotalCases(today - 14)) with y somewhere around 0.9 on average. From this we can compute how quickly do we need the number of weekly cases to fall for both f = 0.12 and f = 0.14: 2.a) f=0.12, we need y < 0.726 for Sept 14 and y < 0.849 for Oct 4\n2.b) f=0.14, we need y < 0.689 for Sept 14 and y < 0.827 for Oct 4 Both 2.a) and 2b) make it almost impossible for this question to be solved before Sept 14, and relatively unlikely for Oct 4, as it requires a decline of the number of cases considerably faster than what we are seeing.

However, with the lag time needed to reduce case loads across the population and the difficult measures likely needed to achieve this it is at best early October before this is back under some degree of control. \n"], [92249, "2020-07-30T13:24:15Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.03, 0.42, 0.55], ""], [80764, "2020-07-30T10:23:11Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.14, 0.26, 0.6], "The formely incomplete data seems to be complete now, with a plateau 1000 below the one before.

Those who die are hospitalized for longer, but can be factored out as they are not the overwhelming majority of hospitalization outcomes. If we assume 21 days to resolution of the current cases (treat them as if they were all admitted today), that would lead to total discharge by 8/11/2020. That is not going to happen, as new cases are increasing rapidly, and there is suggestive evidence from some US cities that total cases are between 2 to 13 times the known cases (https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/health/coronavirus-infections-us.html). For that reason, I rule out cases being below 2,500 before August 3rd, with only a 2% chance of that outcome between 08/03/2020 and 08/23/2020, and a 5% for the period beyond that.

One thing I think I should look at is the number of current cases and how recent they are. Assumptions:\nWhen I say \"current\" I mean that they haven't recovered.\nI assume that if someone is hospitalized, they suffer from sever COVID19 symptoms.\nI assume that if someone dies in hospital from COVID-19 that lowers the count. Reading this webpage (https://www.houstonmethodist.org/blog/articles/2020/apr/recovering-from-coronavirus-what-to-expect-during-and-after-your-recovery/), I note this statement: Recovering from severe COVID-19 illness\nIt can take anywhere from several weeks to months to recover from severe COVID-19 illness, and you may be in the intensive care unit and possibly even on a ventilator. The current number of hospitalizations in Texas is: 10569 (as of 2020-07-20)\nThat's 3665 new cases since the 1st of July. Imperial College London projected health care needs assumes an average stay of eight days. This conflicts with my assumption of severe cases and taking between weeks and months, so I look to take a different approach for this forcast. There are currently 353000 confirmed cases in Texas and there is no statistic for recovered. But we can use the ratio for the US as a guide (3.9M confirmed, 1.13M recovered, estimated percentage of recovered is 28.97%) so we estimate that there are (1-0.2897)*353,000 = 250720 currently infected in Texas. and only 10569 hospitalized, one could say for every 23.72 people infected, 1 person is hospitalized. On 2020-06-16 there were 2518 Hospitalizations in Texas. At the same time, there were 93206 confirmed cases (same arithmetic as above I estimate there were (1-0.2897)*93206 current cases at that time) 66204.22 current cases at that time. Corresponding to  1 hospitalization for every 26.29 currently infected people. \nTaking the mean of these two I arrive at 25.005 current cases per 1 hospitalized person. So really I would expect there to be less than 2500 cases when there are less that (25.005*2500=) 62512.5 current cases in Texas. Which is 13% of what we estimate there to be current cases now. So what is the probability that the number of current cases will drop by 87% for those dates? Let's assume (best case scenario) that right now, there will be no increase in active cases.\nTexas population is 29 million people\nAustralia has a population of 25 million people. \nIt took Australia had a max number of current cases on April 3rd: 4935\n13% of that is 641.55, they didn't reach that until May 12th (They're seeing an increase again but Im using this as a guide for recovery)\nSo best case scenario it will be at least a month until we will see 2500 or less hospitalizations in Texas\nI would assign a 0% chance for this be the case throughout the month of August This is naive approach due to the way the virus actually spreads with larger numbers. But I use this for a guide and make estimations based on this. I plan to go further with this but I'd like to hear some other thoughts from you guys!

However, it may take another week or so before these trends really become pronounced enough to elevate this issue above the partisan rhetoric in order to make it to the general public. These values are my best estimate based on the data available at this moment, and they can be interpreted as a reflection in the sentiment that I personally feel that this issue will get much worse before it gets better due to many factors that have persisted for far too long in my home State of Texas, with lagging mask use being one of the primary reasons along with the failure of state leaders to set an appropriate tone as to the seriousness of this pandemic.  Both trends for COVID-19 related deaths and hospitalizations have trended upward since Memorial Day(prior to this they were flat), and as I believe monitoring how local healthcare systems are being impacted is a much more relevant indicator as to this viruses presence in our community - due to its ability to overwhelm those systems being of paramount concern as that is the primary threat it presents - it would then be reasonable to expect continued upward trends to create a much lower threshold at which we could adequately address and contain larger outbreaks so as to prevent \"super clusters\" of infected individuals from appearing in likely regions (e.g., Houston, San Antonio, Dallas).  It will be interesting to see if a surge similar to the one that occurred after Memorial Day/Mass protests (not sure how much protests may have impacted Texas) will happen due to the July 4th holiday; If the R0 factor is truly around 2.5 (as CDC best estimates), and if the most recent surge was due to the gatherings occurring after restrictions eased, then the surge that could theoretically happen in the next week or so could see COVID-19 related hospitalizations rise to the 15,000 to 17,000 range by the end of August. This scenario would more than likely prompt the Texas State Government to take drastic and swift action to prevent the local healthcare systems from being overwhelmed in both the short-term (being 3-months) and long-term (being 9-12-months) due to the strength this virus will most likely gain as winter months bring with them an increase in immunosuppressed populations as well, being Vitamin D levels have been demonstrated as being strongly correlated with worst outcome scenarios for COVID-19 patients in ICU's from other countries suffering from this pandemic (Alipio, 2020).

The other large hospitalization areas that recovered, New York and Illinois, returned to a similar level from a month out after another month from the peak. Texas is worse because of the velocity and the lower adherence to measures, but we know more so prevention and treatment are more effective.

The most important pattern is that the new weekly cases at day n-9 are a very good predictor of Covid-19 beds at day n, though the offset 9 is not necessarily exact. It could be 8 or 10 days, or something similar. In short: Cases (n-offset) - Cases(n-offset-7) = factor * Hospitalization (n) with offset around 9. For Texas this also seems to be true. During the growing phase, the 2500 hospitalizations mark happened on the 16 of June, which indicates that we should look at the increase in cases between 7 of June and 31 of May, a bit less than 11K cases. This suggest that covid-19 hospitalizations will go below the 2500 mark about 9 days after there are less than 11K cases in a week, though this last number might have to be larger is there is increased testing, maybe 14K cases. Yesterday the weekly new cases were about 68K and 79 days away 4 of October. If we want to have less than 14K cases 9 days before that deadline, we have to reduce the weekly number of cases by a factor of 0.85 per week to reach the mark. If we use the original 11K as a better mark, the weekly reduction has to be by a factor of 0.83. After the first peak, the weekly reduction of deaths (not cases) in the US was about 0.86-0.88 per week, with a daily variance of 0.06-0.08. If I use this as a proxy of future reduction of cases, we are about half a sigma away from having less than 11-14K cases. But this is assuming that the daily variance of the weekly decrease can be used as a variance of what will happen in the following 10 weeks. And this is not the case: the variance along a longer period of time is actually smaller. Besides, we do not know whether Texas would be able to reach that level of reduction: it might happen that they are able to reduce it at the rate of the European countries (0.65-0.80 reduction per week), or it might happen that they will barely able to reach a 0.9 weekly reduction. Not to mention that this is a period of 10 weeks: any social distancing measure (bar a full two months and a half lockdown) will quickly run into social distancing fatigue, which will imply the impossibility of reaching the required level to be below 2500 hospitalizations. This means that my forecast right now is optimistic. However in just a pair of weeks it will be possible to determine with a very high degree of confidence whether we should go to 100% in the \"Not before 4 October 2020\" bucket.

If the same logic can be applied to Sweden we see that between the peak to when the number of patients in ICU was down to 1/4 there were 68 days.[2] 68 days from 14 July is 19 September. \nThe pandemic seem to have had a more explosive development in New York than it has had in Texas. In New York there are 17 days from when you first hit 1/3 of the eventual peak to when you hit the peak[1], in Texas it was 24 days (assuming a peak was reached 14 July).

Polls show that Maga people are far less likely to wear masks and more likely to go to bars, barbers and eat inside a restaurant.  The number is still rising right now and will likely peak in the next two weeks.  This guess is most uncertain variable.   Governor Arnold has wisely imposed a statewide mandate and is threatening to shutdown the state if it is ignored.  So, this cuts toward a shorter time to peak.  So, today is July 15.   Sept 15 is almost exactly 60 days away and October 4, is about 80-81 days away.   So, the time to reach 2500, will take 45 to 60 days post-peak plus 15 days pre-peak.

By August 5, it is likely their numbers will still be on the rise or at an unsustainable plateau.

By August 5, their numbers could be topping 20-30,000 per day, making it harder to drop as quickly as NY. We could expect to see a drop by August 28, but by based on patterns with NY, it took 30 days to get back to their numbers from the shutdown date (around 5800).

In NYS, the first case was identified on 2/29/2020, and the peak of cases hit on 4/10/2020, roughly one month.  After that, new cases declined very very slowly (and are continuing to decrease very slowly through today, July 15).  The rate of positive cases is sort of a thermometer into looking at all other statistics - hospitalizations, deaths, and recoveries are all contingent and positively correlated with +cases.  While you can't always tell how many deaths or hospitalizations you will have, the slope of the +cases trajectory will be mimicked by other statistics.  So the patterns of +cases (initial rapid increase followed by a gentler declining slope) is imitated by other stats. Now in the areas where there were significant quarantines (Italy, Greece) or stay-put orders with teeth (ie, NYS - high fines for violations, etc.), the general heuristic is that it takes roughly 100ish days or so for any of the rates to get near or close to 0.  If you look at the peak of NYS, which was 4/10 --> 7/13 (the first day without any COVID-19 related deaths), that is about 94 days.  Hospitalizations usually lag about a week or two behind +cases and deaths. However, the great state of Texas is not quarantining nor are they imposing teeth on their stay-put orders (at least not what I have seen as of today 7/15/2020).  My strong feeling that the first time we will see a decrease will be in November 2020, although there is a small probability that we might see a decrease between 9/14 and 10/4 (7/15--> 10/4 is 79 days, just under the 100ish mark, but we don't have any confidence intervals for that - remember it's just a heuristic).

None of those are/will be true of Texas.  Instead, I'm looking at California and Illinois as comparisons. California is obviously a bad-case scenario - the outbreak never quite came under control statewide and is now worsening again. Illinois is my good-case scenario, with slightly less than half the population size of Texas and a hospitalization peak that's slightly less than half of where hospitalizations are in Texas right now. It's not an optimistic good-case scenario. It took about two months for Illinois hospitalizations to drop to 1/4 of the peak, and they barely made it there and are now showing signs of worsening again. On top of that, their lockdowns/compliance were likely better than Texas's will be, and I don't think Texas hospitalizations have actually peaked.  Looking at the broader view, so many states continue to struggle with backsliding regardless of how good their responses were, and public will for containment/mitigation measures seems to be slowly but steadily waning.

In fact, it is entirely possible that the number of cases and hospitalizations keeps rising over the coming weeks or months. My thinking aligns pretty well with the crowd. However, I do not think we're near the peak in Texas; it's positive rate is rising and the whole region is increasing in cases, deaths, and hospitalizations.

If I become nice and says that triggering lockdown will cause occupancy to go down by 100 people each days, it will take at least 79 days for the number to reach 2500. 15 July + 79 days = 28 September. However, I think 28 September is a wishful thinking. Even if G.A triggered lockdown, occupancy will not immediately go down. People who are sick before the lockdown will go to the hospital. At the very least, the occupancy will go up for the next two weeks after the second lockdown.  As a comparison, at the height of COVID 19 in UK, 60% of (normal) beds were vacant [1]. Now, in Texas, only 50% off bed are vacant. If It took UK 2 months to be able to reduce the level of threat to an acceptable level, I suspect it's going to be a longer duration for Texas.
