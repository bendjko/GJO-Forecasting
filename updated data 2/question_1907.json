Schoo-lecture on Monday evening, in which she expressed her displeasure the formation process stalling over right-wing unwillingness to work with left-wing parties. Without explicitly naming him, she criticized caretaker Prime Minister Mark Rutte and the VVD, NOS reports.\n. . . \nKaag also spoke about the cabinet formation process, which has been dragging on for nearly six months since the parliamentary election on March 17. Kaag said that it is \"difficult for her to comprehend\" why the formation attempt with left-wing parties GroenLinks and PvdA failed.  . . .  In the summer, the VVD and D66 as the largest two parties wrote an outline that was to form the basis of a coalition agreement, with the idea that other parties could join the coalition based on its content. PvdA and GroenLinks reacted positively to the content, but the VVD and CDA insisted that they don't want to govern with both left-wing parties. Even after GroenLinks and PvdA offered to join the negotiations as one bloc, instead of as two separate parties. According to Kaag, potential allies where therefore excluded on grounds other than content. \"The level of The Hague commotion in this formation is much too high. More time seems to be spent on what is written in the newspaper than the history we want to write ourselves. I don't feel comfortable with that,\" Kaag said. Former formation informateur Mariette Hamer made similar points when she presented the report on her failed attempt to find a majority coalition. Kaag said that it is now up to the six parties involved - VVD, D66, CDA, GroenLinks, PvdA, and ChristenUnie - to come up with a solution together. \"A good cabinet in the Dutch tradition is a cabinet that consists of conservative and progressive forces. So a balanced cabinet,\" she said. As the largest party, the VVD has \"the responsibility to regain substantive support and political confidence, especially from the left,\" she added. The new informateur, Johan Remkes, will start investigating the possibilities for a minority government later this week. Kaag said that her party is willing to talk, but only under clear conditions, including actually tackling the climate crisis. \"It is the precondition for everything else. You will understand that I cannot be a credible part of a cabinet that does not deploy a dramatic and ultimate acceleration of the Dutch climate policy.\" ~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  Thanks for this link goes to @fisherdbus @https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1333630.  \nI am having a hard time imagining a \"marriage\" of Rutte & Kaag after all the public dissing.

The 70-year-old former VVD home affairs minister took over from Labour politician Mari\u00ebtte Hamer this week as the talks moved into the cabinet formation stage. Remkes has given himself a month to try to forge a minority coalition . . .  he warned he would not stand for parties continuing to rule each other out as potential partners, after VVD and CDA rejected a five-way coalition with two left-wing parties while D66 refused to team up again with the ChristenUnie (CU). \u2018If they stick with that attitude I\u2019ll be done with it very quickly,\u2019 Remkes said on Wednesday after meeting the three core parties.  \"On Thursday he will sit down with the leaders of CU, Labour (PvdA) and GroenLinks, the other participants in Hamer\u2019s exploratory talks over the summer. \u2018It is up to the parties themselves to come out of this impasse,\u2019 he said. \u2018The mutual relationships need to grow.\u2019 He said the talks needed to focus on substance rather than political strategy, \u2018because there are urgent problems that are asking for a solution.\u2019 \"GroenLinks leader Jesse Klaver said his party would not get involved in behind-the-scenes discussions to support a minority cabinet. \n. . .\n[To summarize:]  \"VVD leader and caretaker prime minister Mark Rutte rejected a five-party coalition with PvdA and GroenLinks as \u2018unstable\u2019, . . . argued that only one of the parties was needed for a majority cabinet, but their leaders were only prepared to go into government as a duo. Rutte\u2019s preference for a cabinet with the CU was blocked by D66 leader Sigrid Kaag because of the two parties\u2019 fundamental difference on issues such as euthanasia and abortion rights. A cabinet of VVD, D66 and CDA would have 72 seats, four short of a majority, meaning either CU, GroenLinks, PvdA or the nationalist right-wing JA21 could supply the votes it needs to get its legislation through the Lower House.

The fact that the CDA will be in the next coalition already seems a foregone conclusion - the VVD and CDA have both been vocal in their determination to keep working together. But at least one more party is needed for a majority in parliament. \"The candidates for that party is ChristenUnie, and left-wing parties PvdA, and GroenLinks. The two left-wing parties are determined to only join a cabinet together, so that the left-wing plans don't disappear under those of right-wing duo VVD and CDA. \"And based on the plans that leaked from the draft coalition agreement, it seems that the VVD and D66 are also aiming for a coalition with the left-wing parties, despite VVD and CDA reluctance to work with both parties. Especially the plan to give people control over the end of their lives suggests this. The D66 has been championing a legislative proposal to allow euthanasia at the end of a complete life, while the ChristenUnie blocked that from happening in the current Rutte III coalition. The embryo law will also be a sticking point for the conservative Christian party. Kaag also recently reiterated that the D66 isn't enthusiastic about working with the ChristenUnie again.  \"Last week it was expected that informateur Hamer would recommend a potential coalition to start formation negotiations sometime this week. Now it seems that she's waiting on GroenLinks and PvdA member consultations happening on Saturday, regarding the parties' proposal to join the negotiations as a single bloc. The outcome of the PvdA consultation in particular will be exciting, as some members are still smarting from the major losses the PvdA suffered after the Rutte II VVD-PvdA coalition.\n~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  So, \n1) something has been happening!  \n2) but it has been a slower process than anticipated even as recently as last week\n3) The PvdA consultation which went on today may move things along, or not!

I was able to translate it 2 paragraphs at a time, no problem.\nhttps://eenvandaag.avrotros.nl/item/oud-kamervoorzitter-weisglas-wil-nieuwe-verkiezingen-als-formatie-niet-opschiet/ What I got out of the article (besides what you mentioned) is:\n-the writer called the current delay in government formation \"shocking\" and \"embarrassing\".  Where was he 4 yrs ago when it took Rutte until early November to form a new government?   \"Shocking\" doesn't seem to me to be an apt adjective because this is not unprecedented.  Rutte has to work with the cards that the electorate dealt him:  a very splintered election result, split between parties that do not want to work together.  It's not particularly \"embarrassing\", either, given that it took Merkel how many months to form her current coalition?  and Italy has had how many governments in the last 4 years?   -The writer is clamoring for a new election.   How well did that work in Israel?  How many times did they have new elections in Israel which produced such splintered results that they were unable to form a new government?  3?   Why would Rutte do this?   BESIDES, if new elections will be called, then this question will DEFINITELY resolve as \"not before 18 Sept 2021\". -One thing the writer mentioned that might make a difference/get things going & resolved sooner is if there is a new \"formateur\"/lead negotiator selected who is not from one of 2 largest parties.. . . someone other than Rutte (been there/done that, not liked), Kaag (not liked) or Hammer (not perceived as neutral, weak?). . . Is anyone asking for this besides him? So, the questions I have are:\n-is/are there some policy issue(s) that is/are pressing that the public/parliament want addressed?  Is this creating pressure on Rutte?\n-what is the mood of parliament?  Is it getting antsy? \n-where's public opinion on this?  is the public starting to agitate for a resolution to the situation?\n-is Von der Heiden just one of those people who needs to see his name in the headlines every so often?   I'm increasing my forecast for \"not before 18 Sept\" just in case his thinking prevails and rather than form a new government, the decision is made to call a new election.

(https://bit.ly/32oZd2m) Rutte off VVD, the party with the largest polling and Kaag, of the D66 who received the second biggest proportion of votes, seemed to be at odds as to which parties they would respectively accept as coalition parties. Hence, a few stumbling blocks to overcome at the start of the process of finding compromise and agreement on who would be in the coalition. As has been the case in the past, 'scouts' from VVD & D66 were appointed to work on the coalition. The scouts are also referred to as 'negotiators'. Now, nearly a month after the elections, the scouts have had to resign when press photographers exposed the scouts discussion notes which showed that Rutte was apparently trying to sideline a slightly controversial, in his view, opponent, Pieter Omtzigt (CDA). It appears that the only person aware of this was Rutte. This begs the question why Rutte apparently wanted to sideline Omtzigt? Could it be because Omtzigt was effectively the cause of the downfall of Rutte's last coalition  because of his investigation into the child welfare / tax office debacle? Very possibly, IMO. Nonetheless, this led to a vote in parliament on Rutte's suitability. A vote of no confidence would have seen Rutte powerless in the new coalition. As VVD do not have an heir apparent, they clearly had to vote against any vote.  A compromise 'vote of condemnation' was the result. Parliament and more importantly, the public regard for Rutte appears to be diminishing by the day. See https://bit.ly/2QgVbGD Thus, the scouts had to resign and a new scout has been appointed to see if a coalition can be created that would be accepted by all the potential parties thereto. As Rutte's influence and standing is now reduced, I suggest the creation of the coalition will take longer than originally anticipated. Some serious 'horse trading' is likely to take place over a longer period as possible coalition partners are sounded out and common ground found amongst the parties that initially rejected various potential partners.

I assess that these factors could largely negate the possibility of negotiations carrying on as long as they did in 2017. https://www.politico.eu/article/2021-elections-to-watch-europe/"], [8826, "2021-02-04T18:20:28Z", [0.9, 0.05, 0.05], ""], [94872, "2021-02-04T05:56:50Z", [0.8, 0.16, 0.04], ""], [914, "2021-02-04T03:46:06Z", [0.6, 0.3, 0.1], ""], [87744, "2021-02-03T07:48:46Z", [0.8, 0.2, 0.0], ""], [18679, "2021-02-03T03:05:57Z", [0.88, 0.1, 0.02], ""], [73970, "2021-02-02T17:31:13Z", [0.85, 0.0, 0.15], ""], [59836, "2021-02-02T16:29:18Z", [0.65, 0.3, 0.05], ""], [63472, "2021-02-02T04:56:49Z", [0.7, 0.2, 0.1], ""], [94872, "2021-02-02T04:41:28Z", [0.75, 0.2, 0.05], ""], [94872, "2021-02-02T04:40:26Z", [0.73, 0.22, 0.05], ""], [62808, "2021-02-01T23:21:14Z", [0.35, 0.65, 0.0], ""], [62808, "2021-02-01T23:20:20Z", [0.2, 0.7, 0.1], ""], [34959, "2021-02-01T01:52:44Z", [0.75, 0.22, 0.03], "Polling heavily in VVD's favor,  making it much easier for government formation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2021_Dutch_general_election"], [72708, "2021-02-01T01:01:30Z", [0.7, 0.28, 0.02], ""], [97747, "2021-01-31T23:09:49Z", [0.5, 0.35, 0.15], ""], [45650, "2021-01-31T14:54:56Z", [0.65, 0.35, 0.0], ""], [691, "2021-01-30T21:57:48Z", [0.68, 0.3, 0.02], ""], [1333, "2021-01-30T14:12:34Z", [0.65, 0.26, 0.09], ""], [1333, "2021-01-30T12:58:55Z", [0.65, 0.25, 0.1], ""], [94872, "2021-01-30T01:33:14Z", [0.73, 0.22, 0.05], ""], [22690, "2021-01-29T10:24:18Z", [0.84, 0.08, 0.08], "Based on the fact that the last government was actually popular before it resigned (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-netherlands-politics-idUSKBN29J1L0), that the 3 current main coalition parties and either CU or GL are polling enough to have a majority, and looking like you are playing politics while people are dying, and the economy is suffering, should increase the pressure to form a government quickly I am starting at 84%.

In polling this scandal has eroded support for the leading governing party VDD. The current coalition (VDD & PvdA, plus allies) only gets a projected 69 seats, 7 short of the the 76 needed to form a goverment. Council on Foreign Relations wrote the following:\n\"Dutch General Election, March 17. Dutch voters head to the polls next year to elect the 150 members of the Tweede Kamer, the lower and more powerful of the country\u2019s two legislative chambers. Prime Minister Mark Rutte and his People\u2019s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) have been in power for ten years and are expected to have another strong showing. The centrist VVD\u2019s coalition partners are currently predicted to lose a few seats. This center-right coalition took a record 208 days to put together in 2017 but lost its narrow majority in both houses in 2019. It will be up against the populist Freedom Party (PVV) and its leader Geert Wilders, who favors taking the Netherlands out of the European Union and closing all mosques. Rutte refused to partner with Wilders after the PVV won the second most seats in parliament in 2017. The recent collapse of another far-right party that did surprisingly well in 2019 midterm elections has solidified Wilders\u2019s claim to the populist right, and the PVV is expected to maintain its second-place status in the Tweede Kamer. Rutte, who could become Europe\u2019s longest-serving leader after Angela Merkel steps down, will likely face another tricky coalition-building process to keep the prime minister\u2019s job.\"\nhttps://www.cfr.org/blog/ten-elections-watch-2021 In the last 40 years, it has taken on average about 92 days to form a government with a 1 standard deviation of between 40 and 144 days. Since 2003, it has taken on average about 122 days to form a government with a 1 standard deviation of between 60 and 184 days. Depending on how polling proceeds it will likely take a little longer to form a government, given the scandal and current governing coalition lacking 76 projected seats. The current coalition of 5 parties will likely need another party or do what has been unthinkable a VDD-PVV led coalition, but likely only if this drags on like in 2002 when assination and rising right lead to a year of political chaos. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Dutch_general_election The pandemic and vaccination effort will likely have in impact that is yet to be determined.
