The resulting difference in money supply has since seen the riyal\u2019s value plummet to about 1,000 to the dollar in government areas, while the value in Houthi-controlled zones has held relatively stable at 600. Citizens and businesses in both government and rebel-controlled zones have been left out of pocket by the divergence, but especially those in the former, given rampant inflation there. As the riyal plummeted to new lows in recent weeks in government areas, the central bank there pledged to withdraw the series of banknotes that had accumulated in its territory after the Houthi ban in late 2019. The central bank in Aden was caught out because it had expected the new notes to eventually spread evenly through both zones, but the concentration of supply in the government zone stoked inflation there and spurred the exchange rate divergence.

There is good reason why Saudi Arabia was able to play such a major role in 9/11 and commit the alleged murder of Khashoggi and get away with it without repercussion from the United States. Middle East politics is very simple. The United States does whatever Saudi Arabia and Israel want.
