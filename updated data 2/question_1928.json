Pero, \u00bfSpaceX o Virgin Galactic lograran este cometido?. SpaceX en el ultimo tiempo a logrado grandes avances en la exploraci\u00f3n espacial privada. Entre los principales logros, fue la primera empresa privada en tener un cohete en la \u00f3rbita espacial y tambi\u00e9n fue la primera empresa privada en llevar astronautas a la ISS (Estaci\u00f3n Espacial Internacional) con el cohete Crew Dragon (noviembre 2020). Otro gran logro que ha cosechado su due\u00f1o, Elon Musk, es concretar un contrato millonario con la NASA y formar una alianza que hasta ahora no ha tenido problemas. Tambi\u00e9n con la alianza formada con la NASA, cumpli\u00f3 el deseo de esta de llevar de vuelta al espacio astronautas estadounidenses y no depender de cohetes rusos. Por otro lado, Virgin Galactic realizo un vuelo exitoso a la \u00f3rbita terrestre con su fundador, Richard Branson, el 11 de julio. Sin embargo, su gran lista de fracasos a puesto en duda la seguridad y confianza que transmiten a sus futuros usuarios. Adicionalmente, la incertidumbre de un posible fracaso en alg\u00fan vuelo de prueba para el vuelo comercial solo a provocado una continua ca\u00edda en las acciones de la empresa. Es por esto que pongo todas mis fichas en SpaceX, que ademas anuncio de manera oficial, a principio de a\u00f1o, que realizar\u00eda un viaje comercial en el ultimo trimestre de 2021 con la misi\u00f3n Inspiration4.

I'm impressed that the technology seems to already exist.  At this point, it really seems the major hurdle is obtaining government approval. From https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/26/space-tourism-how-spacex-virgin-galactic-blue-origin-axiom-compete.html - Virgin Galactic has already sold about tickets to about 600 passengers at a price between $200,000 and $250,000 each, although the company expects it could increase its prices substantially for the first commercial flights.  To date Virgin Galactic has flown five people to space on two test flights. All five are company employees, with four pilots controlling the spacecraft and chief astronaut trainer Beth Moses riding along as a test passenger on the second flight. - In the summer of 2020, SpaceX, with its Falcon 9 rocket and Crew Dragon capsule, entered the orbital tourism arena. This summer SpaceX launched and returned two NASA astronauts with its spacecraft for the first time ever, in a mission that was historic for both Musk\u2019s company and the U.S. space agency.   SpaceX had already signed two separate agreements with companies looking to fly private paying passengers to space. While NASA\u2019s astronauts spend months up at the ISS, the private missions will be only about 10 days at most. Initial research seems to indicate that Virgin Galactic is further along.  However, their space vehicle suffered some setbacks on a launch that was supposed to occur in early February.  Unity's first two spaceflights, in December 2018 and February 2019, took off from California's Mojave Air and Space Port, near the headquarters of Virgin Galactic's manufacturing subsidiary, The Spaceship Company. But the upcoming third flight will lift off from Spaceport America in New Mexico, Virgin Galactic's commercial hub. It will be the first crewed space mission ever to launch from the state.  Unity has already tried once to make spaceflight number three. But the space plane's rocket motor failed to fire properly during that first attempt, on Dec. 12, 2020, and pilots C.J. Sturckow and Dave Mackay brought Unity down for a premature but safe landing at Spaceport America. (SpaceShipTwo takes off beneath the wings of a carrier plane, then makes its own way to suborbital space after being dropped at an altitude of about 50,000 feet, or 15,000 meters.)  https://www.space.com/virgin-galactic-spaceshiptwo-unity-third-spaceflight-delay So my initial feeling is that SpaceX seems in the 8% likelihood, Virgin Galactic a bit higher, like maybe 27.  Since both cannot be higher than any of the others (conjunction fallacy), I'll put Yes, both at 5%.  Therefore, no takes the remaining percentage. Checking the \"wisdom of the crowd\" I'm really surprised to see that SpaceX is higher than what I suspected.  I'll read some of the comments and see if I can be convinced by the crowd.  I like the comments put forth by @MCJNDU and @ml2021, but I'm not willing to go as high as they are.  However, I will adjust my numbers accordingly to go with the crowd. - SpaceX seems in the 23% likelihood, Virgin Galactic 15%.  Since both cannot be higher than any of the others (conjunction fallacy), I'll put Yes, both at 10%.

In 2001, MirCorp, a Russian spaceflight company, ferried the first space tourist to the international space station abord a Soyuz spacecraft.  Russia has conducted manned launches onboard Soyuz rockets since 1968.  The delay between their first successful manned flight and first space tourist flight was regulatory in nature, not technological.  For SpaceX and Virgin Galactic, the opposite is true. The 2004 Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act effectively removed any legal impediments to space tourism through 2023, allowing the industry to go through a \u201clearning period\u201d before imposing legislation (https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46500).  Currently, U.S. companies need only receive FAA certification before beginning space tourism flights.  Once SpaceX and/or Virgin Galactic receive FAA certification, very little regulation stands between them and their first tourist flight. The best indication of whether either company will ferry tourists into space in 2021 is to see how their actual progress compares to their proposed timelines. In December 2018, after a successful test flight, Virgin Galactic announced an aggressive timeline for their first space-tourist flight.  Virgin\u2019s plan was to establish a launch facility in New Mexico by early 2019 and begin commercial flights by mid-2019.  Virgin Galactic aborted their first attempted launch from the NM facility in December 2020 after the aircraft\u2019s primary rocket failed to ignite.  The launch was rescheduled for 13 February 2021 but canceled three days prior due to \u201ctechnical issues\u201d discovered during pre-launch checks.  This puts Virgin about two years behind their initially proposed timeline.  Virgin still needs to complete two test flights before earning the required FAA certifications for commercial space flight.  At their current pace of one successful test flight every 26 months (December 2018 to present), Virgin Galactic will not complete required testing for FAA certification until 2023.  I assess Virgin Galactic\u2019s likelihood of success in 2021 at only 5%. SpaceX plans to ferry tourists on its Dragon spacecraft, which has already received FAA certification.  Despite some delays between tests, SpaceX consistently met its milestones leading up to its first ISS mission on 2 March 2019.  In a 1 February 2021 statement, SpaceX said their first all-civilian mission will take place \u201cno earlier than the fourth quarter [2021].\u201d  While SpaceX has proven its ability to meet its milestones, the caveat \u201cno earlier than\u201d does not express strong confidence SpaceX will complete a tourist flight before the end of 2021.  Of note, SpaceX has several launches already scheduled throughout 2021, but has not scheduled this mission with NASA, the European Space Agency, or Roscosmos (the Russian Corporation for Space Activities) https://www.space.com/32286-space-calendar.html.  This is likely a further indication that SpaceX is unsure of its ability to meet a 2021 deadline.  I assess SpaceX\u2019s likelihood of success in 2021 at 40%. Rather than sold for profit, seats aboard SpaceX\u2019s proposed first all-civilian flight will be awarded to St. Jude\u2019s Children\u2019s Research Hospital employees and donors.

Then again, they're aiming at the fourth quarter of this year AND it's Elon Musk saying it - nothing against the man, he's a hell of an entrepreneur and certainly a bulldog when it comes to those things he believes in, but he's also known to be fairly bullish on his timelines. I believe he believes it pays to light fires under folks' butts (and rockets! Ha!), so he tends to push aggressive timelines. Add to that the fact that COVID is still running around adding uncertainty to the playing field, and I think we have added downward pressure on their likelihood of launching in time.  As far as I can tell Virgin isn't even planning to put its civilian mission up this year. Seems like a pretty unlikely shot.
