In fact they seem to follow a nice sinusoidal curve. Removing the first 75 days I got a mean of 28 states and a variance of 9, from which I fill the buckets. However, without lockdown it seems really difficult to be below 10 states: probably the lower buckets can be safely removed, but I have temporarily left them. Besides, after Christmas and new year, I would expect an increase in the number of states with Rt > 1.00. This might indicate that I am being too optimistic.

Even if the pandemic is largely under control in the U.S. by January, I think the crowd is overestimating the probability of Rt being below 1 in most states. It doesn't take much for the Rt to be above 1, even when the transmission is largely under control! Also note that 11 January is soon after the holidays  \u2014 when we can probably expect a lot of maskless indoor gatherings.
