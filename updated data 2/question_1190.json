Analysis assumes fixed costs related to refining, transportation, sales, taxes, etc remain fixed.  I see 4 factors that could impact gasoline prices:\n- demand/refining costs\n- slowing global growth\n-hurricanes in the Gulf\n- geopolitical tensions in the Middle East I think markets are under-pricing geopolitical risks, hurricanes Cat 2 or stronger hit the gulf region on average every other year. A category 4 or higher storm occurs on average once every 15 years. This would likely shut down refineries and increase costs at the pump. On the downside, however so-called \u201cwinter blends\u201d for gasoline are cheaper since they are less refined. As a result, Refiner Resale prices fall in December by about $0.20 compared to August. Lastly, global growth is expected to slow which could create additional downside risks for oil and subsequent gas prices. In aggregate, I think these factors support the downside more than the upside.

Travel is also lower in the winter (though may spike for the holiday season) and environmental additives aren't required Before I get the chance to really dig in and do my own research, I'll start with the EIA's STEO forecast (https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=39112) the chart is a bit difficult to read, but it shows the Dec, 2019 price at ~$2.50. Based on Standard Errors, I calc'd the St Dev at about $0.25. That would suggest that 68% of results would be within $2.25 to $2.75. Half of that is within the $2.40-$2.65 ranges, but a symmetrical distribution would suggest there is more risk on the downside. That downside risk is further supported by the negative skew in recent (rolling 1-year) gasoline prices.

Range $50 to $90, the most likely one, outputs $2.40 to $2.90 per gallon.\nI focus on Brent price for the moment. Brent distribution at 30/12/19 seems to be 10% - 35% - 40% - 15% for ranges [<$50, $70, $90, >$90]\nThe US Energy Information Administration, in their Annual Energy Outlook 2019 [4] is projecting $75/b for 2019 and 2020.\nHowever, some geopolitics impacts should be considered:\n- End of Iranian oil waiver, as step in the US decision to terminate the nuclear agreement [5], with reaction from the EU [6]\nThe end of the waiver will worsen Iran's economic situation, already seriously damaged to the point of questioning the system [7]\n- Venezuela's production cuts are expected to increase shortly [8], but Russia and China will maintain support. China might be pushed by US trade agreements, but it seems it's not happening.\n- Short term increase in inventories in the US, suggesting that demand is weakining. Production in US hit a record-high in April [9]. This should be considered as short term, showing a trend but more uncertain as of 30/12/19.\n- Saudi Arabia is expected to increase production, from producers [10] and also US [11]. I assume it is in KSA interest to increase production, reduce price and make US oil less profitable.\n- Saudi Arabia's economy might be suffering, as per some indicators as Aramco bonds [12] or unemployment rates.\n- It is uncertain (to me) what US position would be, as high price would benefit US coporations but damage economy, still strong and early for 2020 presidentials.\n- Anecdotical interest on Anadarko, with huge shale assets in America's Permian Basin, by Occidental and Chevron [13]\n- Adding to this, chances of a recession in the US before 31/12/19 are low. All in all, many ups and downs in the mid term projections of the Brent price. I would go to an increase in the $70 - $90 range's probability by 15 points, from both >$90 and <$50. Also, reduce the weight of short term impacts, adding uncertainty heading to end of the year.

The secular change that occurred in the U.S. oil industry, namely, the shale revolution, is effectively acting as a cap on prices because producers are ready to ramp up if prices rise high enough. This effect is not fully represented in the data sample used above.  Seasonal patterns may likewise have an effect beyond the base rates (which are agnostic to what time of year it is). My prior is that there is less driving in the winter and that may push the price lower a bit. Testing the seasonal effect statistically will be the subject of future posts. Finally, I am apprehensive of falling for fundamental attribution bias but perhaps one ought to consider the fact that there is a president in the White House who seems particularly averse to high gas prices and may be willing to intervene, namely through the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which he has done before [2]. The upcoming election year in 2020 will provide a further incentive for him to do so.
