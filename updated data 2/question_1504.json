Happy to report that my spouse and I passed the 14-day self-quarantine period with no symptoms at all.  It is either that we did not get exposed or did not get infected.  Since we did not get tested for the virus, we don't know the answer.  But it does not really matter because the virus is circulating in Washington state for sure. I have a proposal though.  I am interested in doing a postmortem (pun not intended) on this forecast question.  Specifically I want to know how this small group of forecasters (that worked a lot on the question) performed versus the bigger crowd and why. For those interested, after the Brier scores come out, you can post the scores (yours, median, etc.) to this thread (access from the Closed tab) and write a brief paragraph or two on how/why you did right/wrong, maybe even should have done.   I think we can all learn something from this.n  Thanks.  It's been fun interacting with you all.  See you in other forecasts.

The policy discussion that has resulted in the latest prediction by @Anneinak is really interesting, and I want to go forward with it. Now, it is not clear how many strategies are there for dealing with this (@nigster, @Joseph-Noko), but I can see at least three: 1) Equipment: every one wears a mask, knows how to wear a mask and knows the basic rules of hygiene. This is what has happened in Taiwan and Hong Kong, with the plus for Taiwan that they were really really fast in closing all air traffic with China. This Taiwan model for some reason seems to be forgotten (media influence by China maybe?), but it's ideal, not painful and the economy keeps running. Maybe its success is due to the weather, or more likely by their previous experience with SARS. 2) Confinement: the simple and effective model championed by China. It works, it does not require an endless fight if done properly, but the economy takes a gigantic hit. In the case of China they will take two hits: the month plus of confinement with the subsequent lack of production of anything for exporting and the problem that is coming: with all the West soon in confinement too, what is the point of going back to the factories in Guandong? There are no orders. Now, besides the giant hit in the economy, this strategy needs to be followed to the very end and then it requires to close your borders. You need to be completely sure that the epidemic has been eradicated or you are back to square one, and you better do not go back there because not sure what is going to happen after the second hit. Problems: 2.a) Unless you seal your frontiers and find till the last case in your territory, it will not work in the long term. Then this might be a better strategy for a consumption-based economy like France or India, than for China: how are they going to keep doing business with Africa? 2.b) When and to whom do you open your frontiers? This creates a really interesting prisoner's dilemma scenario: if you are the Schengen area and have finally managed to control this, do you trust the data from China? If you are China, are you totally sure that these guys in Brussels that are not imposing really strict measures have the situation under control? 2.c) Only one undetected case is required to go back to square one. 3) Herd immunity: if you can't win them, join them! This is probably the definite strategy, in the sense that after a bad time (which might feel like an eternity) you are done! Two modalities: uncontrolled (Iran) and controlled (UK?, the Netherlands?) 3.a) the uncontrolled version ends up in a real carnage, but after that you sure get herd immunity and you can go back to your normal life after mourning the dead. 3.b) the controlled version, which is the famous plan proposed by the UK government, but which has big probabilities of not really being implemented because the public pressure against it will mount till incredible levels. This strategy requires an insane amount of coolness. The controlled version is to try to implement the most viable solution to the problem in an orderly fashion. We all know that some of us will die in this scenario, but somehow we keep totally calm and just proceed with it. One can try to prioritize that the children get infected and then pass it, so you remove one of the most effective vectors of the virus. Then you go with the teenagers, people in their twenties, etc. The result is theoretically a small number of deaths in comparison with the large number that you could have, but you can do it without blowing away your economy, particularly if you want to do business with every one. It also gives you a wonderful biological weapon against the countries that decided containment, as you just need to reintroduce your newly endemic virus into enemy territory. Maybe this could be the next move of Iran against Saudi Arabia.  But then what can I say, for my age group the prospect of a 5% probability of hospitalization, though merely 0.4% of death still do not look that great. I am not itching for being intubated, even if my chances of dying are minimal.

But I see one thing, that gives me hope (of course also hoping, that the reason isn\u00b4t just the lack of testing kits and also fearing bad briers on all the other questions related to corona, I\u00b4m in): daily growth rates are not increasing further in the regions I analysed (with my homecountry germany the only bigger exception in Europe (where this is currently growing fastest)). China, South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore have all been relatively stable for a while now. Growth in most countries in Europe isn\u00b4t as bad as it was in the last days. Although we have got 162 of about 200 countries in the world on the list now, it looks like even the numbers of the worst growing countries on worldometers could stop growing at 20%+ per day with growth even declining in many places. There are some worries, just looking at todays numbers: Malaysia, Pakistan, parts of South Amerika have huge growth rates today, and there as well as in Africa the medical situation might not be perfect.

We watch it until it undermines a corner of our house because it would be so much trouble to move.\nHow do we react when told we have an illness that is incurable?  We go to Mexico for a cure.\nHow do we react when a gigantic wildfire is headed our way?  We watch the flames & smoke from our homes.\nHow do we behave when someone ferociously attractive is in our arms?  We take risks.\nHow do we react when there's a pandemic and we're asked to social distance?  We think \"I'll be ok; everyone looks healthy\". I thought about decreasing social contact for about a week before I actually began to do it.  It's not just that we don't understand exponential growth, we don't respond well to threats and dangers.  We either don't recognize the danger (the wild bear), can't accept the truth (of death), procrastinate (about quitting smoking), are lazy (not wanting to expend the energy to move), are frozen in fear (as a wildfire approaches) or think that the laws of statistics and biology don't apply to us. We wait.  We wait until the very, very  last minute. Unfortunately, this almost always results in us being unable to maximally mitigate the impending disaster. Therefore, I expect that what we do will be far less effective than if it had been done earlier, and if the necessary infrastructure had been in place (like ventilation machines, N95 masks, etc) long ago.   Hence, my high forecast for 200k +. Others far, far better educated than I have done the math.

I think that the next question should be \"How many cases will be by April 2\" with the highest bucket at 1M+. My two models: A) Model 1: I average the number of expected new cases till the 20 of March for a doubling time of T0 = 5.5 and T0 = 4.7 days, which gives me N20. Then assume a log-normal distribution with 68% of probability between N20 / factor and factor * N20. This time I reduce the factor to 1.5 (instead of 2 as previously): 0, 0, 0, 10, 90 B) Model 2, I check the necessary doubling time for avoiding hitting 200K in the 6 days left of the question: T0 > 5 / Log[2, 119/75] ~ 7.5 days I compare it with the doubling time over the last few days: 3.8, 3.8, 4.2, 4.3, 4.6, 4.6, 4.6, 4.4, 4.3.

There's an \"exponential growth\" theory about. I'm coming at this from a different angle but the answer is the same. If you look at the chart on this website: https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6, you should see two spikes in the data. Today's leap may be thanks to exponential growth, or it could be an outlier thanks to the random distribution of chance making today a particularly bad day: for example, 5 people in 100 could be infected every day, but out of those 5 per day, maybe 2 are tested on day 1, 3 on day 2, 5 on day 3, and maybe on day 4, the 5 untested carriers plus the 5 infected on day 4, all get tested. Even when growth is flat, the number of new cases can follow a different growth function. Indeed, the number of atual infections can fall even as the number of tested new cases rises! So my question is, is today just a bad day or is today proof of the exponential growth theory?  So one of two things can happen, the rates of new cases follow this spike and maybe in 3 or 4 days we breach 200,000, or, the numbers fall again to an 8-9,000 day range. I personally expect the median for the next 7 or so days to be 8-9,000, but, it actually doesn't matter in a sense: because of this spike or new wave, to reach 200,000 by the 20th, we now only need a daily average of 9,000 new cases if the total number of cases for the 14th ends at 155,000. Worldometer has the number of new cases at 155,792 right now. If the number of cases today ends at 160,000, we just need 8000 new cases a day. The number of new cases yesterday was 7499. Another bad day and even if the rate falls, 200,000 will be an easier hurdle whatever the growth function.  I am not totally sold on the exponential growth theory, and I think, like the seasonal flu, the growth curve follows a logistic function. There's a fascinating article and it shows where you get with an exponential function and where you get with a logistic function. I did the sums for an exponential function as well starting from Jan looking forward and the numbers were obscene and way too aggressive. This article makes a better case: https://medium.com/swlh/novel-coronavirus-simple-analysis-and-predictions-6338e7870a43. And here's an earlier case for exponential growth: http://www.renewamerica.com/columns/cherry/200126.  As I said, at this point it doesn't matter if it's logistic or exponential because the spike in the last 24 hours, could either set a trend for a daily average or be an outlier, either way, the daily average needed to get to 200,000 has fallen to something within reach.

This means an average daily growth of ~ 14.2% (I get this by doing (2.54)^(1/7) - 1.) Let's model ROW growth each day t with a random variable G(t). In the end we are interested in whether G(14 March) x G(15 March) x ... x G(20 March) > 2.54. In order to use standard theorems I will turn the above into a sum by taking logs, so I will be interested in the variables ln(G(t)) instead, and want to know how likely it is that ln(G(14 March) + ln(G(15 March)) + ... + ln(G(20 March)) > ln(2.54) ~ 0.932. For simplicity I assume the G(t) are all independent and identically distributed, so I will drop the t. I think this is reasonable while the absolute number of cases is quite small in each ROW location.  The average and sample stddev of { ln(1.25), ln(1.28), ... , ln(1.21) } are ~0.197 and 0.0265 respectively, so our best estimates of average(ln(G)) is 0.197 and of stddev(ln(G)) is 0.0265. Hence the expected value of the sum of 7 copies of ln(G) (from 14 March through 20 March) is 7*0.197 ~ 1.379, and the stddev of that sum is sqrt(7)*0.0265 ~ 0.07.  Hence a growth of < 2.54x, meaning ln(G(14 March) + ln(G(15 March)) + ... + ln(G(20 March)) < 0.932, would be over 6 standard deviations below the expected value. Which seems extremely unlikely; less than 2% likely by Chebyshev [3]. De-extremizing to 95% to account for simplicity of this modeling.

Given the bottleneck in testing, or, in the case of countries such as the US, a seeming reluctance to test aggressively, the real figure is likely to be much, much higher.  In terms of the reporting, it becomes difficult to get a sense of where the math is headed.

It needs to reach 111.1k for us to reach top bucket. This means 3.07x growth. For context, here is ROW growth over the past few days (compared to the previous day): 06 Mar 11.2k (+25%)\n07 Mar 14.3k (+28%)\n08 Mar 17.6k (+23%)\n09 Mar 21.3k (+21%)\n10 Mar 25.3k (+19%)\n11 Mar 29.6k (+17%)\n12 Mar 36.2k (+22%) We have 8 days to go; what % does ROW need to grow per day to do 3.07x in 8 days? Well, 3.07^(1/8) ~ 1.15, so with 15% daily growth we will get there. We have been well above that for the past week; the geometric mean of the growths above is +22% daily. Moreover, if we take the average and standard deviation of { ln(1.25), ln(1.28), ln(1.23), ln(1.21), ln(1.19), ln(1.17), ln(1.22) } we get ~0.1985 and ~0.0285 respectively; and it turns out that even if we assume daily growth TWO standard deviations below the mean --- i.e. a growth of e^(0.1985 - 2*0.0285) --- it still comes out to 15.2% daily growth, which is enough to reach 200k, as discussed. What could drive deviation from the average scenario, which easily reaches 200k? Pushing the average down is the big lockdown in Italy (2nd largest number of cases). However, the lockdown happened on 9 Mar, so it will only (or mostly) slow down the appearance of cases that would be diagnosed after the question deadline. I read that the incubation period for the virus is ~2 weeks, so most everybody that will be diagnosed in the coming 8 days got the virus before the lockdown. Similarly for other countries that may do future lockdowns. Pushing the average up is the fact that less testing was probably done over the past week in ROW, than will be done in the coming week, as countries wake up to the threat. Using the weakest possible estimate (Chebyshev's inequality [1]), the odds we would see growth above (mean - 2*stddev) are 87.5%; adjusting for qualititative factors above it should be at least 90%. If instead we use a normal distribution to approximate the aggregate growth in the next 8 days (central limit theorem), the odds of reaching 200k are 98%.

Might as well do the calculations again with today's numbers. It seems China (or at least China's reported numbers) has contained the disease, so I focus on ROW throughout. There are 80.9k cases in China so ROW needs to get to 119.1k to reach top bucket. There are 32.8k cases in ROW now so ROW needs to 3.63x. The more qualitative factors are still: US just began testing more widely (so more reports), South Korea and Italy are in heavy lockdown (so less transmission). Looking at the reports from past several days, it does seem South Korea has largely stopped spread. Just a week ago the growth rate was >12% new cases daily, now it's below 2%. So let's take Korea's 7.5k out of the equation, now we have 25.3k \"doubling-liable\" ROW cases. This means they need to 4.41x for the top bucket to be realized. In contrast, Italy has been seeing ~20% new cases daily for the past ~10 days, and today's report was no different. So I don't take them out of the equation. According to the horrible map on the first page of [3], most cases are spread throughout Europe, plus Iran. I've not heard of any other country besides China + SK + Italy doing massive lockdowns so I doubt the spread will slow in any other countries. According to [4] the doubling time in ROW has been 4-5 days throughout March; but if I take out SK, who have seen a big slowdown, that means the doubling time ROW minus SK must be LESS than 5. So it looks as if we're right on the edge: we need 2.14 doublings (4.41 ~ 2^2.14) and the remaining 10 days are between 2 and 2.5 doublings. THat would suggest 50/50 between the top two buckets. However, another bottleneck is the tests themselves: cases can only be reported after the appropriate test comes back positive (I assume?), and I imagine e.g. Iran can't scale the testing quick enough for this question. I would wager the same of India --- their current reported cases, and especially the growth, seem ludicrously low. Finally, some country may start a heavy lockdown in the next few days. So I adjust from 50/50 to 60/40.

Doubling period of 3-4 days, >2 such periods to go. Seems a sure bet. Except, China seems to have contained it, and they have 81k of those 110k. (Or at least, they are reporting numbers that makes it seem that way, and that is what matters for this question.) This leaves the \"doubling-liable\" population at ~29k. Still, we have only 90.4k cases to go before 200k, and that is merely ~3.2x 29k. For contrast, 11 days is 2.75 doubling periods (if doubling time = 4 days), leading to a naive exponential estimate of 2^2.75 ~ 6.7. To phrase it differently, how long would the doubling period have to be, for us to not reach 200k? We're only allowed to grow 3.2x (a little less actually) and that translates to \"1.68 doublings\", i.e. 3.2 ~ 2^1.68. Since we have 11 days left that would require the doubling period to be 11/1.68 ~ 6.5 days (a little over actually). In contrast, estimates of the doubling time outside China are currently in the 4-5 range, have been \u22646 since Feb 20, and have been \u22646 on 88% of days this year [2]. From another angle, my understanding is testing just got unblocked in the US, so that will probably lead to an uptick in reports in the short run.

The epicenter is an acute care nursing home in a suburb of Seattle in the state of Washington.  About 3 to 7 residents died in that facility in a typical month.  But since 19 Feb, 26 residents died, 13 of which were tested positive for covid-19.  We don't know whether the other 13 deaths were related to the virus.  It is recognized that the virus existed in that facility probably several weeks before the first death.  The virus has spread outside the facility already.  Right now, there is little, or no, attempt to track the people exposed to the virus.  At this point, it might be impossible to track.  (The US is a very mobile society due to the extensive use of cars.  One example is the 12 miles between the nursing home and where I live is considered to be a very short distance.  I go to that suburb once or twice every week.)    Right now, there is no attempt for massive testing for the virus.  This explains why the fatality rate in the US is so high right now.  There is definite no plan for massive lock down of communities.  For one, it is probably too late as the virus has likely spread widely (due to mobility of the population).  For two, it is difficult to do in the US culture. To minimize exposing the population to the virus, many companies In this area have mandated employees working from home.  Universities are holding virtual classes.  But primary and secondary schools are still open.  Some cultural events and conferences are cancelled or postponed.  But so far, few sports events are cancelled and there are still plenty of spectators.  This is another oddity in the American culture - sports come first.   People are coping.  Restaurants and movie theaters are half empty.  Traffic is much less.   We are running out of hand sanitizers and toilet paper in stores.  Some people are staying home due to fear, but some people just carry on with their routines.    How is this going to end in the US?  Right now it is in the accelerating stage.  I don't see a lock down coming, unlike China, SK and Italy.  Even with a lock down, it is too late to contain the virus as it has spread already.  My hope is that the virus outbreak is seasonal, just like SARS and the common flu.  The other hope is that the fatality rate for covid-19 is much lower than the 3.4% reported so far - this number is driven mostly by reported cases from China which some people believe are way under reported.  If the under reporting is by a factor of ten, then the fatality rate will drop to the level of the common flu.

Well, this morning's freshly backed data: 25.5K cases outside China growing exponentially, 106K cases worldwide. We need 94K new cases to reach the 200K+ mark, and this requires: Log_2 (94K /  25.5K) ~ 1.9 doublings Having 12 days left, we need a doubling time above 6.4 days to avoid hitting the 200K March. Alternatively we can use the official 7 of March WHO data, in which case we will need a doubling time below 5.9 days to avoid hitting 200K, which is the same estimate as with yesterday's worldomoter data. This indicates that the official 8 of March WHO data will also converge to 6.4 days. In the last few days the doubling time has decelerated indeed, from 3 days one week ago to 4 days now. If the deceleration continues at this rate we will double again in 5 days and then in 6 days, reaching 200K by 19 of March. But I don't really know if this is going to stand up, it might be overly optimistic. Assuming that the average doubling time from here till March 20 is 5.5 days with a standard deviation of 1 day, this puts the 6.4 day mark at 1.1 sigma's away from becoming a reality.

But why should they test at all anymore, if it\u00b4s totally clear, that there are millions more infected but just not formally diagnosed? https://english.alarabiya.net/en/coronavirus/2020/03/07/Coronavirus-death-toll-in-Iran-rises-to-145-infections-now-5-823.html What do you think ? @Prognosticating-Beek @Dillyweed @ManuPV @dlaiocean @cmeinel  Gamechanger?"], [11200, "2020-03-07T11:34:03Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5], ""], [11200, "2020-03-07T11:31:28Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [85923, "2020-03-07T10:42:17Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.99, 0.01], ""], [45594, "2020-03-07T10:19:37Z", [0.2, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1], ""], [58072, "2020-03-07T09:31:53Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.7, 0.3], "Cases so far: 102,188 (https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) so we can rule out all but the highest two ranges now.

It is 18 days until March 20. Over the past 18 days we have had on average 1500 confirmed cases per day. 1.5k x 18 days = 27,000 cases.\nThere are a lot of factors to consider when making this prediction: The rate that countries test people - Its likely those with mild symptoms will not be tested in most countries, however South Korea is testing people free of charge which has seen a spike in `confirmed` cases in South Korea. If other nations adopt this method, expect confirmed cases to rise above the 1.5k per day average. Countries are honest about their confirmed cases - Iran has been accused of not reporting all cases. Its likely Iran will keep this up as they will not want to be exposed as liars, the Ayatollah will not look to weaken his position. Lebanon should see a rise in cases as they have had 2500 visitors from Iran over the past week. Iran has a proxy in Lebanon so they could stretch their influence to reduce the number of confirmed cases. Lets say that all these factors happen - Nations start to test more and countries are honest. lets say this results in 3 x the daily average for the next 18 days. 18 x 4.5k + 90k already confirmed. = 171k. We would have to see a rise from daily confirmed cases from 1.5k to 6.5k for the total number to exceed 200k.\nTo put this into perspective, China, the most populated country who did not see this coming, were unprepared and slow to act, has averaged 2 thousand cases per day (Though this has drastically slowed). There are a number of reasons why this is unlikely, borderline impossible.\n- Travel Restrictions are in place amongst the worst areas.\n- There are huge economic impacts and therefore the worlds governments will do all to stop the spread.\n- If we did see a outbreak of 5k daily cases, the world would lock down and all travel would be restricted.

I have adjusted upward, and anticipate the highest likelihood between 100,000-200,000 cases by March 20.\nTo explain as I did in my first forecast: I am using the Logistic Distribution function to model S-Curve (cumulative) cases. This is the system dynamic of disease propagation as explained by many including Dr. John Sterman of MIT (see Business Dynamics, and the original work in System Dynamics by MIT Prof. Jay Forrester). The function is fitted to a line using the GRG algorithm in Excel Solver. However, this method is not without difficulty as an optimum point is not provided by the Logistics Distribution function.

This phenomenon is global. However, due to the widespread advice to self isolate, and the often mild presenting symptoms which may be confused with other conditions, plus that when people are housebound, ill, self-isolating and following guidelines, as they will not be tested they won't be part of these totals, plus the present definition by the WHO of being proven instances of moderate to severe cases. In nations without free healthcare, these 'mild' presentations and the prohibited cost vs limited benefit of treatment in non-severe cases also means less reporting. China, a hugely populous country has already had its officially reported \"peak\" and that Present total is c.93,000 cases, while other regions with huge populations, high inequality, without free access to healthcare  (India, African, South America, Pakistan, South East Asia) will likely not add significant numbers to the above. I therefore would estimate that while the present growth rate will continue to gradually rise (current typical case diagnosis rise from last month, apart from the day china changed case metrics, has rarely strayed beyond 1%(+-0.5%)), this may increase slightly, but likely not enough to push it over 200k). I predict that the REPORTED new cases rate may rise to 1.75% (+/-0.5). Therefore giving my most likely prediction range as being between 115k- 135k total.  For it to exceed 200k it would need the daily reported case rise rate to be roughly 4.6%, which is not impossible, but highly unlikely given the reasons outlined above.

They were past the tipping point in the Wuhan area and needed to ensure that they didn't pass the tipping point elsewhere. What's the equivalent tipping point in the US? \nThere are roughly 70,000 ventilators (or about ~20 ventilators /100,000 population) in the US. (extrapolating from this Source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21149215). Perhaps half of these are NICU units and i assume those can't be used on adults. So for the purpose of this analysis we have ~10 ventilators per 100,000 population. Based on data from China, about 20% of cases require ICU and half of those require a ventilator. So we could have up to able 10x as many cases as ventilators before we start running out of ventilators and the death rate goes up sharply. So our tipping point would be when we hit about 100 cases / 100,000 population, or 0.1% of the population in a given area.  Example: in Washington (state) with 7.5M population the tipping point would be roughly 7.5k cases. My estimate is that we're at about 1,200 cases today in Washington.

Of new concern is the finding previously unknown clusters, even in the USA. Of note is this is a secondary infection not primary from travelers from China. That reinforces my thinking that many second and third world countries have wild clusters established and will begin to spread fast. They may not detect them in time to add to 20MAR WHO report.

It is 18 days until March 20. Over the past 18 days we have had on average 1500 confirmed cases per day. 1.5k x 18 days = 27,000 cases. \nThere are a lot of factors to consider when making this prediction: The rate that countries test people - Its likely those with mild symptoms will not be tested in most countries, however South Korea is testing people free of charge which has seen a spike in `confirmed` cases in South Korea. If other nations adopt this method, expect confirmed cases to rise above the 1.5k per day average.  Countries are honest about their confirmed cases - Iran has been accused of not reporting all cases. Its likely Iran will keep this up as they will not want to be exposed as liars, the Ayatollah will not look to weaken his position. Lebanon should see a rise in cases as they have had 2500 visitors from Iran over the past week. Iran has a proxy in Lebanon so they could stretch their influence to reduce the number of confirmed cases.  Lets say that all these factors happen - Nations start to test more and countries are honest. lets say this results in 3 x the daily average for the next 18 days. 18 x 4.5k + 90k already confirmed. = 171k.

There are a number of reasons why this is unlikely, borderline impossible. \n- Travel Restrictions are in place amongst the worst areas. \n- There are huge economic impacts and therefore the worlds governments will do all to stop the spread. \n- If we did see a outbreak of 5k daily cases, the world would lock down and all travel would be restricted.

I'm convinced true case numbers are already way higher than reported (see below). Anyway that's not the question, it's how many will be reported.  Here's why I think true case numbers are much higher than reported:  1) Iran: official tally is ~50 deaths which implies about 2.5k infections roughly 15-20 days ago. (2.5% death rate, average of 14 days to die from onset of serious symptoms + 5-10 days incubation period). With doubling period of 5 days that would imply that the first cases arrived in Iran in mid January. It also implies roughly 20k active cases today. That may sound nuts, but when you consider that 3 senior govt officials are sick that we know of, and one has died, that gives a sense of the magnitude. Also if you look at the dozens of cases that have spread to ~10 nearby countries, that's an indication of the magnitude in Iran as well. Will they ever be reported? probably some will and most will not. But they will cause the disease to spread and keep the numbers worldwide going up.  2) However ... unofficial reports (credible to me but ultimately uncertain) are that deaths in Iran are over 210 at this point, so you can multiply all that by about 4. 80k cases in Iran.  3) However ... Here's another, independent way of estimating those numbers: Bahrain has reported that ~2,300 people have returned to the country from Iran since Feb 1. (https://www.timesofisrael.com/bahrain-threatens-arrest-of-travelers-from-iran-untested-for-virus/) Of those 310  have been tested and 38 are confirmed. Let's assume that the 310 were in fact the most sick of the bunch and every positive case was detected in which case we get a rate of 38/2,300. That's 1.65% of all travelers from Iran confirmed. That's a minimum of course because only 310 cases were tested, but anyway.... There are 80M people in Iran. Let's limit it to just those who live in Tehran and Qom where most cases are reported. That's ~10 M people => Let's say our sample of people traveling to Bahrain is representative of infection rates in Iran, then 1.65% x 10M = 165k people infected in Iran. (Note that there is a lag because these people came over the last 30 days and probably represents a mix of a lower percentage early in the month and higher percentage later in the month. Plus a growth factor for an average of 15 days). Who knows, but still that's a reasonable minimum estimate. I'll call it 2-4x to account for these factors (i.e. 1 or 2 5-day doubling periods), so between 165-600k people infected today in Tehran and Qom by this method. Plus however many are in the remaining 70M population outside those areas.  4) Similar analysis in the US: We heard about 2 new cases about the same day they died. The numbers are a bit fuzzier, but Let's just start with the 2 deaths in Washington. Same math => ~75 infections 20 days ago => ~1,200 today again assuming a 5-day doubling period.

Of course the doubling time could be bigger or smaller once we try to guess the sampling fraction, which could be factor out with some Fermi estimate. If we assume that the fraction of undetected cases on 31st of January where tens time higher than now (e.g. in January we only detected 1/20 of the actual cases and now 1/2), we will still a doubling time of 4.7 days (compatible with R0 ~ 3.3 in that compilation of studies).

Lets step back from our models and speculations and do a consistency check. On 1 March, there are 87k infected cases worldwide (including China). There are 20 days before the closing of this question. China has been reporting 300-400 daily new cases for several days. If we assume that the daily cases do not change much, 20*400 gives 8k. The worldwide aggregate daily cases are still on track for doubling in 3 days. SK appears to be slowing down, but other countries can easily pick up the slack. Lets be conservative and assume the worldwide cases stay at 1000 per day for another 19 days. This gives 20k. So 85k+8k+20k = 113k.

Here are top the arguments I see for continued exponential growth through March 20: \n1) the population outside of China is 5-6x larger than inside China so this has lots of room to run\n2) * the rest of the world cannot provide a strong, unified containment measures like in China: virtual house arrest  and restrictions on travel of >50% of the population for over a month is just not feasible in much of the world\n3) * there is no longer a single containment focus, but multiple hotspots and untracked spread in the community Here are arguments I see for sharp slowing of growth before March 20: \n4) For whatever reasons (weather, genetic, cultural, etc) R0 proves to be much lower outside China\n5) * Despite lack of coordinated government action in some places, individuals will react in ways that reduce R0 such as staying home, avoiding public events, etc. All of the above are likely to be true to some extent. However I suspect one or two will dominate over this timeframe and my guess they are #2, #3 or #5, which I have starred above.  Making this more quantitative, the doubling period for total cases outside China has been:\nLast 2 weeks: ~4.3 days\nLast 4 weeks: ~4.8 days\nSince beginning: ~3.9 days\nRate required to hit 200k by March 20: ~5.0 days or lower So if the doubling period slows to >5 days then it we won't reach 200k by March 20. My guess is that's more likely than not based on the factors above especially #5, so I'm calling it 80/20 odds that we won't reach 200k. I'll continue to watch the doubling rate and if it stays below 4.5 for the next week then maybe adjust up.   Here's another way of slicing the data: Below I've categorized countries (or rather \"jurisdictions\" if you like since some of them aren't really countries) based on COVID-19 case growth and I draw these tentative conclusions: \n1) The places where COVID-19 has spread the most and the fastest are moderately cold at this time of year (Iran, northern Italy, S Korea, China, Japan and international conveyance (off Japan).\n2) The places where there have been repeated exposures and relatively large numbers of cases including confirmed local contagion but where it doesn't seem to have taken hold are generally warm: Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia (in summer now), Taiwan, UAE. Is that a pattern that has meaning? I have no idea. It could make sense given that SARS-CoV-1 had rapidly declining survival rates in droplets and on surfaces at higher temperatures, lower humidity and more sunlight.   So I think the evidence suggests we should expect slowing growth between now and March 20 with successful local containment in a few places plus new clusters popping up elsewhere, mostly in colder places.

In an article \"Estimating the Basic Reproductive Number (R0) for African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV) Transmission between Pig Herds in Uganda\" [1], the authors wrote down such an equation (referenced to a book \"Infectious Diseases of Humans\" which I did not read but you can read it in Google Books [2]). The equation is    R0 = 1 + (T / td)*loge2  where T is the infection period and td the doubling time.  Using the doubling time of ~3 days in the infected cases outside China, and an infection period of 12-14 days, R0 is 3.77 to 4.23.  (Note that I am treating the outside-China cases as a black box.  It is impossible to break the cases down to individual countries.  So one can think of the R0 estimated as an effective R0 for the world). The latest update from WHO (29 Feb) shows the daily cases are still on track to a doubling time of ~3 days.  The question is when will the exponential growth start to taper off.  (Humans have a tendency to assume the rapid changes going for a long time.  A good example is the economic growth in Japan in the 80's.  At the time, the US was talking about Japan taking over the world.  Well, its growth tapered off eventually.  Similar thinking happens for the growth in China several years ago). So when will the exponential growth of the infected cases taper off?  It happened for the Chinese cases.   @Greyowlsova you used a logistic growth model for the Chinese cases.  I envision two ways to do this.  One is essentially a curve fitting to existing data (fit the data to a logistic growth curve).  This is relatively easy to do AFTER the data start to taper off.  This methodology is also similar to the S-curve fitting and \"long-tail\" distribution for daily cases fitting used by several forecasters. The other way is to make an assumption (or educated guess) on the turning point of the curve.  Which one did you use?  If it is the latter, we can use the information to make an educated guess on the turning point of the future outside-China cases.

The problem is determining the doubling time: 2.a) For doubling times of 7, 5.5 and 4.5 days, we expect 33559, 61447 and 111611 new cases by 20th of March. 2.b) For doubling times of 6.4, 4.7 and 3.7 days, we expect 41501, 97239, 222350 new cases 2.c) Finally, for a doubling time of three days (the trend during the last few days), we expect 500K+ cases for the deadline This means that the uncertainties compound exponentially and it would be sensible to expect anything between 30K and 500K cases by that date. I will settle to 75K as the most probable figure. This time I will try a log-normal with 75K new cases as the mean and 68% of probability within 37.5K and 150K new cases. This fills the buckets as I had done.

We may never know real numbers for Iran - expect significant underestimation at least on par with China.

Hard to evaluate those, but most probably it will be low numbers as it is evident for countries like Belgium, Russia and India, which have not seen new infections for quite a while.

These international laboratories can support national labs to confirm the COVID-19 virus and troubleshoot their molecular assays.\n2) Strengthening national capacity for detection of the COVID-19 virus so that diagnostic testing can be performed rapidly without the need for overseas shipping. Existing global networks for detection of respiratory pathogens are being utilized including, notably, the National Influenza Centers that support the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System.\n3) Ensuring ongoing test availability. WHO has procured a commercial assay (manufactured under ISO:13485) with strong performance data and shipped to over 150 laboratories globally as an interim measure for Member States requesting support. The main goal is to strengthen global diagnostic capacity for detection of the COVID-19 virus. Support is now also provided to ensure the quality of testing through the implementation of an External Quality Assurance mechanism.\nPublic health efforts are targeted at both interrupting further transmission and monitoring the spread of COVID-19.

However I have doubts that governments will be able to detect and test that many people between now and then; and that they will be willing/able to publicize those results. (Note: to get 120k positive test results they probably will need to test something 500k people and I don't know if they are capable of it. So to get to 200k they will need to rely on clinical confirmation. I assume for my model that will start to happen just like it did in China, but it will be inconsistent and won't change the trend.)  A few factoids and observations for your consideration: \n1) The case in Davis CA implies: \n        a) that there are perhaps dozens of undetected cases in the US. Rationale: He's been on a vent for over a week, so that means that he was infected something like 25+ days ago, in the US. That means he (or she?) and who ever infected him have been in contact with a lot of other folks. \n        b) the CDC doesn't have their shit together given that it took 4 days to test what was obviously a strong candidate for COVID and another 4 days to get the results back despite the hospital raising a fuss the whole time. We'll never keep up with this thing at that rate.  2) On the topic of the US government response: \n        a) the government seems to have every intention of under-reacting and under-reporting relative to reality.  That's not a good sign for preventing further spread. (e.g. from today's CDC Situation Report \"Imported cases of COVID-19 in travelers have been detected in the U.S. Person-to-person spread of COVID-19 also has been seen among close contacts of returned travelers from Wuhan, but at this time, this virus is NOT currently spreading in the community in the United States.\" That is not true, although to be fair the numbers are still tiny so I'll call it half true.) \n        b) I personally know multiple people who have flow back to the US from China and Japan in February (up through last weekend) who have been subjected to zero screening before, during or after their flights. Here's a quote from the CDC website: \"U.S. citizens, residents, and their immediate family members who have been in Hubei province and other parts of mainland China are allowed to enter the United States, but they are subject to health monitoring and possible quarantine for up to 14 days.\" That is not true. NOTE: My point is not to bash the government response. It's a hard job and they are overwhelmed. My point is that ... well that it's a hard job and they are overwhelmed. I've never been in the \"the government can't do anything right\" camp. 3) The situation in Iran probably involves 10k+ cases at this point. When the head of coronavirus response team and the country's VP are both infected, that's a sign that things are going off the rails. And the mosques are still open.

From the model below, I show Ro to be ~1.1 to 1.2 where last week I thought it to be 1.7 roughly. However, now that is is wild in other countries who aren't prepared for the Draconian methods China executed. I expect the Ro to begin to rise again. There is a slim chance to think CoVid-19 will stay below 100k cases as I'm beginning to believe the virus is currently 'contained' in China. Also possible is if you believe other  countries will systemically under report for political ends. Iran clearly is not reporting real numbers at this time. Of new concern is South Korea, Iran and Italy, finding previously unknown clusters. Of note is this is a secondary infection not primary from travelers from China. That reinforces my thinking that many second and third world countries have wild clusters established and will begin to spread fast. They may not detect them in time to add to 20MAR WHO report. I recommend folks follow Dr Campbell on Youtube to get his input, as he has foreign health workers with first hand accounts in Iran emailing him. Those accounts reveal hundreds to thousands infected.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL7oGRKETZM The quarantine's goal is to drop the Ro number from ~2.3 down to less than 1 hopefully, but more likely 1.2 IMHO so we need to adapt that to our numbers.

More on that model here: https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2760912/reporting-epidemic-growth-reproduction-numbers-2019-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov In all, the infections are showing to grow steadily. If CoVid-19 establishes in South America we may get to 200k quickly, not so sure if it is just the Middle East. The model now shows we'll hit 100k, but it looks like more likely end at 120k by 20MAR.

On 25 Feb, the daily cases outside China are 75% of those in China.  Brazil just reported its first case today, and it is having its carnivals.  It is going to spread in South America where the health and political systems are not as advanced as developed countries.  And we have not heard from Africa yet, other than the case in Egypt.

Add the 17k CT scan cases yields 83k.   It is difficult to do an estimate for future cases outside China since it is just starting to ramp up.  If I use a flat level of 1000 cases per day and multiply it to 24 days left, it yields 24k.    Add this estimate for the above 83k yields 107k, just above 100k.

The instantaneous estimate is trending down, so there is a true trend. Containment is generally working in China, or China is lying its ass off. Clearly I am no longer going by TheLancet model of doubling every 6.4 days, as there is obvious signs of slowing at this time. The real numbers for WHO cases over the last 4 weeks are:\n79331 (SitRep Day 35),\n73332 (SitRep Day 29)\n43103 (SitRep 22),\n20630 (SitRep 15) This shows signs of slowing that the Chinese fight to drop Ro is working. From the model below, I show Ro to be ~1.1 to 1.2 where last week I thought it to be 1.7 roughly. If it is 1.1, that is near the critical 1.0 dieoff cliff. If the data is to be trusted then absolutely they are bringing this under control, even with the media sensationalism of the Iranian and Italian clusters. Perhaps it is just clustering in countries starting with \"i\". So no travel to the Ivory Coast. :0) There is now some chance to think CoVid-19 will stay below 100k cases as I'm beginning to believe the virus is currently 'contained' in China. Also possible is if you believe the most infected country, China, will systemically under report for political ends. Iran may not report real numbers in time. Of new concern is South Korea, Iran and Italy, finding previously unknown clusters. Of note is this is a secondary infection not primary from travelers from China.

Instead it's the logic of deciding whether to think in accelerating or decelerating terms. If we accept that the Chinese are getting their arms around this then something like one of the first would apply; outside of China it's clearly exponential: accelerating. The problem is that human brains don't deal well with exponential growth. It isn't intuitive to talk about hundreds of thousands or millions when current data is hundreds and thousands.  One aspect of this problem that I find particularly challenging is that there is an unknown gap between WHO-reported numbers and the underlying reality on the ground. This gap is potentially large and more likely to be a large under count than an over count. Arguments for errors that undercount: It's easy to miss, not test or not to report large numbers of cases; on the over-reporting side there are only false positives. Under reporting could easily be a factor of 2 to 10 in some places versus over-reporting which is presumably limited to something like 10%.  Here's one example: There are ~7 or so deaths confirmed in Iran but only ~43 confirmed cases with no known linkage back to China. 7 deaths / 2.5% death rate implies that there were something like 250-300 cases *14-21 days ago* (which is roughly how long it takes to kill you). It seems probable that there was an index case from China and a subsequent super-spreader event yet to be identified. The ~7 confirmed deaths represents a minimum accounting of all COVID deaths and could be higher. Since the doubling period outside China has been running at 5-7 days implies that a reasonably conservative estimate for the true number of cases in Iran is something like 1200-3000 today. I assume under-reporting in this case is due to some combination of a) limited lab testing capacity, b) low political appetite to announce numbers in the days leading up to a Presidential election; c) most cases are presumably still asymptomatic or showing just mild flu-like symptom and showing up at random hospitals so effectively undetectable; and d) there may be a tendency to not want to self-report cases until symptoms become severe which as we know takes like 1 week after onset of symptoms. Given the history in other places, there seems a reasonable likelihood that subsequent super-spreader events will happen (or have happened) when these people start getting admitted to hospitals.  There are other examples: is a similar discrepancy in the numbers for the Chinese prison system. Many countries have few or no reported cases (like Iran until last week) and those too suggest unreported cases: e.g. India, Congo, Pakistan. (Note that there are also countries like the US, England, Japan and Singapore with apparently much more successful attempts to stay on top of accurate reporting of the disease.)  So the challenge as it relates to this questions are \"Will there be catch-up reporting that is accepted by the WHO at some point before March 20? And if so by how much?\" Clearly the large majority of these cases will never be counted, but the question is how many will?  Like you and others my best solution is to just follow the data, which shows consistent growth outside of China with a doubling period every 5-7 days. That alone will get us over 100k by March 20 even with zero new cases out of China.

It should be noted that there is a lot of uncertainty at the moment, given that opposing forces are acting on the number of new confirmed cases. Daily confirmed cases are rapidly dropping off in China, but new clusters of cases are also rapidly appearing outside of China [3]. It is difficult to assess how these opposing trends counteract one another - hence, I have used a simple linear projection approach that assumes these two opposing trends will more-or-less cancel out. However, the bulk of uncertainty is on the upper tail end given that new outbreaks have the potential to cause an exponential growth in the confirmed case count.

I have looked into untangling the mess and want to share the findings with the community.  The findings have some bearing on this forecast (for me and maybe others). Confusing data:\nChina has changed their criteria on their counting the infected cases several times.   Before Feb 14, only the laboratory-confirmed (a more accurate methodology) cases were reported.  From 14 - 16 Feb, China added a category of confirmed cases (the so-called clinically-confirmed cases) for positive CT lung scans.  On 17 Feb, China started to add the combined (laboratory and clinically confirmed) cases and called them \u201cconfirmed cases\u201d.  WHO followed China\u2019s reporting, resulted in a jump of 15384 (mostly clinical cases) to a cumulative total of 71429 confirmed cases.  (It should be pointed out that CT scans do not provide an accurate indicator of the presence of Covid-19.  The reported number 71429 is likely to be an over-count, probably by a large margin).\n\nThis procedure was followed for 3 days until 20 Feb.  From 20-21 Feb, China decided to report only the lab-confirmed cases and included those in the cumulative count.  After two days, it changed again by adding clinically confirmed cases.  This time it is even worse because it does not report the number of clinical cases separately; they just appeared mysteriously in the cumulative total. The above findings are based on the WHO COVID-19 situation reports [1] which derived the Chinese cases based on official Chinses sources.   All these details are probably too much for the average readers.  The bottom line is, though, there is a 15000-17000 WHO-reported confirmed cases that are clinically confirmed cases.  The WHO 20 Feb reports states that \u201cSome previously reported clinically diagnosed cases are thus expected to be discarded over the coming days as laboratory testing is conducted and some are found to be COVID-19-negative. \u201c  Based on China\u2019s flip-flopping on this issue, it is not clear that this will happen. For the modeling, I decided to remove the clinically-confirmed cases from the data (to the extent that I can).  Then I add the 15000-17000 cases back to the modeled results.  This would probably an over-count as not all the 15000-17000 cases will be laboratory-confirmed cases.  Gleaning from the data that are available (14-16 Feb), the daily laboratory and clinically confirmed cases are about 50-50. Now the modeling:\nMy previous forecast [2] is an attempt to model the decreasing daily confirmed cases, using a Gaussian curve.  It assumes the same up and down slope.  Recent data (I am using only the laboratory-confirmed cases) indicate that the down slope of the curve might is slower than the up slope.  A function with a longer/fatter tail is needed.  I used a Beta distribution function to do that.  \nMy model suggests that the cumulative confirmed cases taper to 65000 in early March.  If I add the entire 15000-17000 laboratory cases to this total, it will yield 80000-82000.  This is below the 100000 threshold in one of the forecast baskets.  If I only added half of the 15000-17000, it will yield about 74000.  The result is based essentially on the China cases as they are overwhelming larger than the rest of the world right now.  We all understand that Covid-19 appears to be spreading worldwide.  But the infections have been relatively slow, unlikely the rapid ramp-up in China.  The dense population in China and the missteps of the Chinese government early on in the outbreak have probably contributed to the rapid rise.  With lessons learnt, I believe that the spreading will be much slow and the total cases will not be much larger than those in China for the duration of this forecast.

Again, given the scale of the outbreak, the data suggests that the NHC is not able to collect all of the case information and report accurately. As such, further adjustments seem likely.

This is the system dynamic of disease propagation as explained by many including Dr. John Sterman of MIT (see Business Dynamics, and the original work in System Dynamics by MIT Prof. Jay Forrester).

The real numbers for WHO cases over the last 3 weeks are:\n73332 (SitRep Day 29),\n43103 (SitRep 22),\n20630 (SitRep 15) This shows signs of slowing that the Chinese fight to drop Ro is working.  From the model below, I show Ro to be ~1.6 to 1.7\n So the only reason to think this will stay below 100k is if you firmly believe the virus is currently 'contained'. Or if you believe WHO will under report cases due to their strict methodology. Or if you believe the most infected country, China will systemically under report for political ends. Of new concern is Iran, which now shows two deaths from a previously unknown cluster. Of note is this is a secondary infection not primary from travelers from China. That reinforces my thinking that many second and third world countries have wild clusters established and will begin to spread fast. They may not detect them in time to add to 20MAR WHO report. The quarantine's goal is to drop the Ro number from ~2.5 down to less than 1 hopefully, but more likely 1.7 IMHO so we need to adapt that to our numbers. My assumptions are :\n1) too late for containment\n2) Wild clusters are undetected in other countries\n3) China will under report\n4) The reported cases will increase geometrically\n5) The new post quarantine Ro is still above 1.4 and below 2 So from my assumptions I have 1 that will lean my estimates higher, and 2 that should tamper my estimates down.

After the update for today, WHO will have the second number close to 71K as well \u2013 bureaucratic channels are always slower. The difference between numbers is that China now includes clinically diagnosed cases - lesions in both lungs by CT plus other symptoms \u2013 in their count while WHO at this point recognizes only laboratory confirmed cases - confirmed by DNA testing (e.g. PCR), but for the big picture reports clinically diagnosed cases as well.\nI should stress that BOTH sets of numbers are INCORRECT as they both differ from the real numbers of infections: laboratory confirmed cases do not include clinical cases that were not confirmed by PCR because of the lack of kits, samples, logistics, personnel\u2026 And clinically diagnosed cases may include cases NOT caused by COVID-19 - pneumonias with other etiology. And both numbers will not include mild cases when people did not get to the hospital and recovered at home or otherwise ignored, deliberately or not.\nSo BOTH reported numbers are just approximations: most probably, the higher number is closer to the truth. Now there are two trains of thought here on GJOP. I\u2019ll simplify both \u2013 please don\u2019t scold me for skipping nuances. \nThe minority one is that if you look at the trends of daily new infections, the outbreak is getting under control regardless of what sets of numbers you use. Using logistic models, the outbreak will be defeated relatively fast if the current preventive measures are sustained.\nThe prevalent opinion is that the REAL numbers are so underestimated that the official numbers, even the 2nd set, do not reflect the true numbers and COVID-19 is spreading fast, though in reference to official counts, its spread may be slowing somehow. And there are of course forecasters in between two views, incorporating some from the 1st, some from the 2nd.\nMedia supports mostly the 2nd view. Even CDC or WHO officials sound more like the 2nd view, warning about the dangers of COVID-19 and pandemics.\nMy opinion is that the officials have no choice, but to inflate the dangers: if not people get lax and all the preventive measures may fail and COVID-19 will spread further. And who is going to be blamed? Yup, them not sounding the alarm.\nMedia of course is prone to sell apocalypses (who would read them otherwise?!), citing rather experts who forecast doom than calm.\nThe deal breaker is the number of deaths. This number is the hardest to fudge. They started going down predictably after the new cases started going down with a certain lag.\nPlease bear in mind, at the end, GJOP will base their resolution on official WHO number, not on a model for REAL numbers even if the latter ones make more sense.\nMy opinion, just wanted to help make sense of all that.

I then \"back calculated\" the trend of total cases from the beginning to build my forecast curves.  Note that this is at best a 'kludge'.  I've not seen anyone change case definitions in the middle of an event and to do so raises questions about the underlying 'real' number of cases.

I will revise again as needed.  One point to mention is the reliability of 'clinical diagnoses'.  Assuming that the PCR diagnosis is the 'gold standard', it would be typical for a clinical diagnosis to exhibit sensitivity and specificity at much lower levels, eg. Sens = 75%, Spec = 75% to make things even.  Assuming that the prevalence (or prior) in this population is high (eg, 60%), then one can estimate the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of such a diagnosis.  This is equivalent to the probability that an individual clinically diagnosed with Covid-19 actually has the disease.  For the example I just did, the PPV is only about 80%.  Depending on the actual values of Sens, Spec, and Prev, the results can vary but this means that the actual count of clinical cases that turn out to be actual Covid-19 are potentially 20% lower than what is stated.  This of course assumes that we are getting the best, most current estimates and that there is no systematic bias in what is being reported.

And yesterday, we got another confirmation of that - number of deaths per day was less than previous day. Which was expected, deaths are lagging diagnosis of new cases. And they started going down right on time - average time between first symptoms and ARDS is 8 days and here the difference between the peak of new cases and deaths was very close - 7 days. Adding more deaths hid that. Furthermore, I think that the Chinese added huge numbers for political reasons - to assuage their own populace that the government does not hide the real numbers AND the moment for that was exactly when they (the government) got convinced the outbreak shows signs of containment.

As of the 11 Feb 2020 the WHO had 43,103 cases - so in 42 days these are the recorded cases. \nIt is widely considered that China is withholding data and potentially there are x10 more cases inside China which reported 42708 on the same date. So 99.08% of reported cases are inside China - meaning that there is no dramatic contagion outside of China.  Large parts of South East Asia and Africa are not reporting cases - meaning that the numbers are wrong.  This means we can discount the first two probability options above and whilst the numbers sit between 25,000-100,000 we know that the current numbers are low and reporting will catch up as we get better at global detection.  In terms of the adaptive system then, we are going to get better at detection and reports will grow over the next 36 days remaining. There will also be retrospective cases added. This pushes the WHO totals up meaning we should start from the assumption around 45,000 today and growing - and think about incubation periods.  We will get better at stopping the spread and dealing with contagion and public health cases - this pushes the rate of contagion down. So if we were to double the cases we would have 90k (applying the Copernicus principle). But this seems unlikely - because of the drop off rate. So it is very very likely to fall between 25,000 to 100,000.

First, a fundamental distinction to be made: A) How many actual cases there will be by 20th of March?\nB) How will there cases be (purportedly) underreported? Regarding A), this goes as in my previous posts: the question is how many doublings there will be. Then assuming the doublings are normally distributed, we will get a log-normal distribution. Using different estimates the results usually look something like: If 50K to 0.5M is the 2-sigma window (+lower cutoff of 60K) : 0, 0, 15, 22, 63\nIf 50K to 0.8M is the 2-sigma window (+lower cutoff of 60K) : 0, 0, 12, 26, 52 Estimations which can be improved by adapting the 2-sigma windows to the new situation. B) There is a problem with the data set coming from China. Today we have seen a dramatic change in the new cases. Reasons for this are: B.1) The new policy for counting cases in Hubei (CT-scan seems to be enough, owing to the lack of enough testing kits) (UPDATE: YES)\nB.2) The WHO observers have been in Hubei for a pair of days, which left the Hubei and central Beijing government with the option of being corrected by the WHO or correct themselves. (UPDATE: MAYBE, but unlike)\nB.3) The central Beijing government wants to use the Hubei government as a scapegoat. (UPDATE: YES)\nB.4) Maybe the Hubei government wants the central government to look bad. (UPDATE: NO)\nB.5) The aliens did it. (UPDATE: NO, probably) (UPDATE: Hubei government out, central government sent Ying Yong to clean the mess, whatever that means. New standards maybe necessary as probably there are not enough test kits and most pneumonias are likely to be caused by the new virus.) Yet actually there is no way to know what is actually happening, because things in China are not transparent. Till yesterday the narrative was: everything is under control (as you can see from the numbers), we will go back to work soon. This narrative has not necessarily changed. A brief chat with some of my more \"officialists\" friends indicates that they really still believe that things are under control outside Hubei. A brief chat with friends that are suspicious of the government usually ends with serious admonitions of \"please do not go back to China anytime soon\". Well, we do not know what is actually happening with the reporting, but till yesterday symmetric sigmoid curves, like the hyperbolic arctangent and the logistic curve, saturated at 50K cases, while non-symmetric sigmoid curves, like Gompertz, saturated at 75K. Today this saturation numbers are 75K and 150K, respectively. Both the arithmetic and geometric means are above 100K, which indicates a high chance that even official Chinese data will cross the 100K line. Besides, if no one has noticed, there is a doubling of non-Chinese cases every seven days or so. With five weeks till 20 of March, this will leave us with 16K extra cases. But probably it will be much less as measures to contain it are expected to happen. Yet their efficacy could be limited owing to the large number of countries affected. Let's say 5-10K, putting a lower punch line of 80-85K cases, too close to the boundary of the 100K bucket.

Before there was the suspicion of moderate levels of underreporting, but from now on this is going to increase. The reasons for that are very well explained in [2]. Which means we have two problems to solve: A) How many cases there will be by 20th of March?\nB) How will local officials underreport these cases? Regarding A), the current data seems to saturate at about 50K cases if we fit it to some S-shape curve. Yet this is a lower anchor only. The higher anchor depends on the number of doublings. With four doublings, which is perfectly possible, we will end up in 0.8M cases, in which case I would end up with a log-normal probability distribution that fills the buckets in approximately this way: 0, 0, 15, 34, 51 (after moving the excluded probabilities from the lower buckets to the higher ones). Other estimates could be from 50K to 0.5M, giving a geometric mean around 160K cases. If we assume this covers 98% of the probability space, we will end up with the following buckets:  0, 0, 19, 21, 60 (where the skewing towards the 0.2M+ bucket happens once we ignore the lower buckets). It is interesting that the second, more conservative estimate, gives a higher estimation for the last bucket. The reason is the lower variance, curiously. Regarding B), it all depends on which is going to be the line in the sand for each province. Now local authorities will have strong incentives to underreport their numbers while taking quarantine measures that are more stringent than other provinces' (sort of contradictory, but welcome to the \"superior-to-the-west\" Chinese political system). For a first estimate, I will think that on aggregate this reduces the probability of the last bucket by 2/3's (that is, we go from 51% to 17% for the last bucket). If we distribute the probability equally among the first two buckets that have not been excluded yet, we will get: 0, 0, 32, 51, 17  But do not forget a last factor, the expansion of the coronavirus outside China. Right now, for a quick estimate there seems to be a doubling of non-China cases every week or so, which leave us with six doublings or a factor of 64. This could translate into another 10-20K cases, maybe 30K, depending on the evolution, rising the lower anchor to 60-70K. This will reduce the probability of the first non-exluded bucket maybe by a six percent (difficult to estimate), which will  go to the next two bucket. Thus I will end up with: 0, 0, 27, 53, 20  which will be my temporary estimate for the time being [1] https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/962324\n[2] https://www.chinalawblog.com/2020/02/chinas-coronavirus-solution-more-government-control-trumps-more-medicine.html"], [57778, "2020-02-11T07:50:46Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.95, 0.04, 0.01], "https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30068-2/fulltext \"An important determinant of whether or not 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) will ultimately cause a global pandemic is its ability to become established upon its importation to a new country. Cases of 2019-nCoV infection have so far been reported in 24 countries, yet little human-to-human transmission outside of China has occurred.\nThe key quantity governing whether or not 2019-nCoV can establish and generate a sustained outbreak on arrival in a new country is the reproduction number, R, which represents the average number of individuals that each infector will transmit the virus to. If R is greater than 1, sustained transmission can occur; if R is less than 1, then chains of transmission will simply stutter out.\nIn the ongoing outbreak, assuming an R of 2\u00b72, as reported by Li and colleagues,1\nthen just over half of infections must be prevented to bring R below 1. This might be expected to be challenging if 2019-nCoV can be transmitted when infectors are not symptomatic.\nHowever, there is little evidence to suggest presymptomatic transmission of 2019-nCoV.2\nEven if 20% of infections are occurring because of presymptomatic infectors (a level roughly halfway between the respective values for severe acute respiratory syndrome and influenza viruses,3\nwhich is likely to be an overestimate), then 80% of infections would be due to symptomatic infectors. Because only slightly more than half of infections need to be prevented to bring R below 1, effective isolation of symptomatic hosts alone should be sufficient to prevent sustained outbreaks of 2019-nCoV outside China.\nOf course, detection and isolation of symptomatic hosts is not always carried out effectively, and detection is challenging when symptoms are mild. Therefore, efforts to counter presymptomatic transmission might sometimes be merited. However, when implementing such measures (eg, the UK's isolation of passengers returning from Hubei, infected or not), the substantial cost to individuals who might not be carrying the virus should be considered carefully. With fast isolation of symptomatic individuals alone, including self-isolation of those with mild symptoms, sustained outbreaks outside of China can be prevented.\""], [57778, "2020-02-11T07:33:33Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.9, 0.09, 0.01], "now, barring it taking off outside china, I predict it tops out at 65k in 14 days"], [13306, "2020-02-11T06:12:43Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.62, 0.3], ""], [84502, "2020-02-11T05:12:57Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.35, 0.5, 0.15], "The numbers don\u2019t seem to be accelerating as exponentially as they were, so down grading confidence for over 200,000."], [1528, "2020-02-11T04:29:24Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.4, 0.6], ""], [57778, "2020-02-11T01:36:23Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.77, 0.22, 0.01], "I predict 85k"], [81304, "2020-02-11T01:14:52Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.83, 0.17, 0.0], ""], [20504, "2020-02-11T00:54:17Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.8, 0.19, 0.01], "Though the rate of growth has slowed a bit since last week, today's situation report still shows ~3000 new cases down from a high of ~4000 last week, the growth rate is a bit stronger than I thought it would be.

The daily increase of infected cases peaked at 3924 on 5 Feb and has been decreasing since (3722, 3205, 3405 and 2672 for 6-9 Feb, respectively) [1].  If this trend holds up in the next couple of days, the outbreak is similar to the SARS outbreak - peaking is followed by a rapid decrease in the daily infected cases[2].  In my previous forecast, I used a piece-wise linear model (several linear trends each holds for 2 weeks) to predict the total infected cases by 20 March.  However, with a turning of the curve in sight only 8 days from the start of the exponential rise, it is clear that the previous model is way too pessimistic.  A much shorter time scale is needed. A new model is developed, taking into consideration of the turning of the curve.  I fitted a Gaussian shape curve to the daily infected cases using the available data.  Then I project the infected cases until it tapers off.  The cumulative curve is very similar in shape to that from the SARS data.   Based on the data (up to 9 Feb so far), the curve tapers off at 60,000 by 20 Feb.  This is much smaller (and sooner) than my previous forecast [3].

The number of current severe cases (patients in ICU) has continued its exponential path. However current confirmed cases have suddenly slowed or declined in Hubei and in all of the other chinese provinces combined (individual provinces generally have small enough numbers that it's tough to make sense of the data). Same for international. Here's are two modifications of my thinking since last time: \n1) The Chinese government has taken a new approach: they are no longer tolerating negative news coverage of the outbreak since around Feb 3-4. This coincides with the number of reported Chinese confirmed cases dropping. My guess is that they are no longer testing as many people and/or aren't reporting the results. Note that this is interesting in terms of the actual wording of the question. Will the WHO rely on estimates or only official Chinese data?) \n=> My conclusion is that we cannot say that the outbreak has suddenly been contained as some people seem to think. That may turn out to be true, but I don't think we can conclude it from the data. I think it is continuing to grow but at a slower pace. However, I do think that the change in Chinese policy makes a lower official WHO result much more likely and this is what's driving my change above.  2) the R0 of ~2.2 still seems pretty solid at least so far. However, case studies suggest that this value seems to be made up of a small number of super spreaders (like the dude on the boat) and a whole bunch of people who infect just 0-1 people. \n=> My conclusion is that this may be easier to contain if that's true. Government and social changes can and will reduce the number and severity of super spreader events. 3) For whatever reasons, this epidemic has not taken off yet outside of China or even outside of Hubei. Is this due to genetic issues? Logistics? Social issues? Government response? Luck?

Worse, there are reports of crematoriums running 24/7.  This would indicate a much higher death rate than reported. China has decreed to ban funerals and all bodies to be cremated by the nearest facility.  I've been trying to verify the high cremation loads by contacting journalists.\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/china-bans-funerals-for-coronavirus-victims-as-death-toll-rises-2020-2 Second,  For those who want up-to-date info but don't speak Chinese follow DW reporter https://twitter.com/williamyang120?lang=en   Note he just reported officially infections past 40k  about an hour ago. Third, this virus is in the Goldilocks zone for incubation time and viral load.  Meaning it spreads really well even though its not as contagious as measles.  Because the virus is encased in proteins, and covered with lipids and such, it can live on surfaces for weeks (up to 28 days in cold weather) and will propagate in the general population easily. I fully expect this to be a pandemic.  The Lancet reported the infected number is doubling every 6.4 days. There are about 6 groups of 6.4 days from now till 20MAR when this ends. By simple calculation, that puts us at 2,400,000 cases rounding for sig figs.\nSo clearly it can reach well above 200k. The question is if the authoritarian government can effectively slow it down.

So far the overall death toll is less than SARS, but it is much easier for coronavirus to be spread from person to person. Currently, China has the highest risk of this virus with majority of the infected population. Outside of China, the number of infected are 307 of confirmed cases. The spread of the coronavirus is not that rapid, with countries and airlines stopping travels to and from China. Most of the virus is contained in China, that is why I do not believe that the number of cases will not be more that 200,000. But, since it is easier to catch the virus and it takes two weeks to find out if someone is infected, this causes the virus to spread easily. There have been reported cases of a cruise ship in Japan that is currently quarantined and twenty Germans from Wuhan have just been flown back home. Since these cases are happening internationally, this foreshadows to possibly more people getting infected, but since there are more careful procedures, it can be contained.

The data have been updated everyday. In the last 7 days (since 26 January), infected cases has been rising almost a straight line. A linear regression of the 7-day data shows a slope of 1898 cases per day [2].  One of the worst scenarios is the number of cases keeps rising at this rapid rate until 20 March.  This would lead to a total of 104919 cases.  I consider this scenario unlikely (and scary) as the rapid rate keeps its pace for 8 weeks.  At the height of the SARS outbreak, the number of infected cases increased rapidly for 2 weeks before tapering off [3].  (Two caveats for this \"unlikely\" scenario.  First is that closer examination of the data indicates that the rate of increase is getting faster, e.g. 2099 in 31 January and 2579 in 1 February.  This means the linear slope used in this model could be an underestimate.  Second is that while 8 weeks are much longer than the SARS rapid inflection peak rate, we have no idea whether the peak rate for the Wuhan coronavirus cases is here already.) A more plausible scenario (model) is having this rapid rise for 3 weeks (till 16 February), then drops to 75% of this high rate and maintain this rate till 20 March (i.e. for 5 weeks).  This would yield 89259 cases.   An even more conservative model is to have the 75% peak rate maintained for 2 weeks (till 1 March).  Then reduce the rate to 50% of the peak rate and maintain it till 20 March.  This scenario essentially assumes we are able to control its spreading by this time.  This scenario produces 80243 cases. I am using the above 3 scenarios for the forecast.  Since the numbers of cases for the later two scenarios are close to the boundary between two of the baskets, they can easily be increased to land in the basket of 100,000 to 200,000.  My forecast are 30% for between 10,000 and 200,000, 70% between 25,000 and 100,000, and 0% for the other 3 baskets.

It can be assumed that if the average time from getting infected to showing symptoms is a week, then most of the increase in reported cases would be linked to people being infected before the Wuhan Shutdown.

Although the people in the affected area will (presumably) be avoiding crowded places it would seem (to me) unlikely that  people would be dressing up with full masks and goggles, washing hands frequently etc. when they mix with their families and close friends, who are symptom free. Given the gap between infection and symptoms appearing it can be assumed that there are between 20,000 and 50,000 people who have the virus but not the symptoms, these people will be passing on the virus, but hopefully to fewer people than they would have if the Shutdown had not been introduced. The next week will indicate if this is true or not. After the number of infected people reaches a certain level it exceeds the capacity of the health care system to isolate and treat the infected. I don't know what the capacity in Wuhan is or will be, but it can seen what happens to flu outbreaks. In 2009 a Flu virus spread to over 500,000 (lab confirmed cases with over 6,000 deaths. Following that outbreak I took part in a large scale research project on flu and flu like viruses, the research discovered that there was a huge range of effect, some people had no or almost no symptoms but had the virus while other people were very ill. So without taking random samples of people (as the research project did) it is impossible to establish how many people are infected or to isolate infected people.

Currently the number of cases is increasing very fast.

If the increase in diagnosed cases drops to 25% (which could be a reasonable guess) after 10 days the number of diagnosed people would increase 10 fold. So 3K becomes 30k by around 7th feb, 300k by 17th Feb.

Since 2004, only a small number of cases have occurred as a result of laboratory accidents or, possibly, through animal-to-human transmission (Guangdong, China).  \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/sars/index.html\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/28/coronavirus-vs-sars-health-experts-on-the-key-differences.html - Chinese health authorities confirmed that, as of today, the 2019 coronavirus outbreak had infected 4,515 people, with 106 reported deaths. (This means the virus has killed just over 2% of those who have been infected. \nOther assessments suggested fatality is 3-4%.\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/28/coronavirus-vs-sars-health-experts-on-the-key-differences.html.) - Most reports seem to agree it is still too early to tell how contagious and how lethal the 2019-nCov is. \n\n- Many don't trust the Chinese government transparency in sharing information on what is really going on (they did quickly make available the genome and other info related to the virus worldwide).  And others do not trust the Chinese gov's capacity to contain the virus from spreading.  - Markets plunged yesterday on fears of a pandemic and its effect on the world economy. \nBut markets are recovering today after the WHO said that it is optimistic the Chinese government will contain the virus.  At the same time, researchers at Hong Kong University contradicted the WHO, assessing that the 2019-nCov could reach 150,000 infections DAILY at its peak. They used an assessment of infections doubling every 6.2 days for the 2019-nCov. -There are reports the 2019-nCov genome shows that it may have originated around October 2019 but it's been officially detected since December 2019. Hundreds of thousands of people left the Wuhan area for the Chinese new year before the alarm was raised about the virus spreading. Reports on origins, transmission, origination have all changed in the last few days. So there are indicators that the virus might not be as lethal and that there may be a lot more people with the virus than reported (those reported are for people tested and confirmed) but that those cases may be milder and have not raised the alarm.    From what we've been told so far, there's reason to believe 2019-nCov may be more contagious but less lethal than SARS Cov. The age of social media spreads information and misinformation, panic and conspiracy theories exponentially faster than SARS in 2003.  But this might also help people avoid getting the virus.  Not betting on any catastrophic event right now but would rather trust the WHO on assessing the crisis as things develop.

The 1917 pandemic was fuelled in part by WWI. It also was most common among adults, in contrast to typical versions of the flu nowadays, where children and the elderly are most likely to die. Also, in 1917 there were no antibiotics to treat secondary infections. Today secondary infection mortality should be much less.  Also, today we know much more about how to control the spread of pandemics. The SARS pandemic killed only some 800 people and sickened 8,000.  GIven the tens of millions of refugees living in harsh conditions, if in this short time 2019-nCoV could take root in some them, for example the one million Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, we might top 200,000.  But this seems unlikely. Another factor that could reduce the likelihood of high numbers is reporting lag. Even if China were to have that many sickened, it is not in the interest of the government to report all cases. In addition, the ability to detect and document so many cases might be poor. COnsider also that so far, no children over age five have been diagnosed with 2019-nCoV. By comparison with the 1917 flu, a major factor appears to have been increased vulnerability of people who previously had suffered an infection by a certain other flu. So it could be the case that mostly adults are at high risk, and indeed only mostly adults living in or near Wuhan. In addition, cultural factors related to crowding and eating with chopsticks from shared dishes among family and friends could have heightened transmissibility. Currently the citizens of affected regions are now following recommended hygiene steps.
