Even if the current daily increase continues (~612/day over the last week) It could go up for 3 more days, then peak, and still not push the 14 day avg over 12k.

My husband was in & out of the ICU for about 8 weeks a couple of summers ago, and it was clear that the decisions regarding when to admit him, what unit to admit him to, when to transfer him out of the ICU onto the med-surg wing, and when to discharge him had as much to do with available staff, who was paying for his care, what equipment they had available where, and who the admitting physician was as his medical status & needs:  ie politics!

I think this may apply here to Omicron, where even though the cases are less severe relative to those who get Omicron, there are just so many people getting infected than ever before that there will be a relatively large amount of people getting severely sick or hospitalized during the wave of cases that seems to be peaking still. Further, it would make sense that the fallout of a rise in hospitalizations and deaths are lagged several days after the peak. I project the trend to reach near 12k around January 22 and like @Dillyweed has said, I don't see many reasons to significantly change the trend soon. I guess one caveat is that winter cases last year seemed to peak around early to mid January. On the other hand, it took nearly 4 months for  hospitalizations to return to baseline after the winter surge. This winter's surge, which is ongoing, started 2 months later than the anniversary of the first wave, so perhaps we won't see hospitalization in the US reaching baselines until March 2022 (I would say 50% chance).

It would have to stay that high for 2 weeks, however, which puts it at Jan 26th.

There are 7914 total hospitalized patients as of Jan 4, which is still 33% less than needed, and that total would be needed for 14 full days still. Since the consensus seems to be that hospitalizations lag cases by about a week, which I agree with, and the dashboard reports ~70k cases/day late last week, that should mean cases would need to be over 100k/day for 2 weeks to meet the criteria. This could change as it affects older populations more, but I believe those are also most likely to have boosters now, which could temper the surge (over 80% of the +50 age group is fully vaccinated, ~5% higher than the 18-50 group).

Hospitalizations lag cases by approx 7-10 days, so estimating the number hospitalized as a fraction of cases 7 days ago will underestimate hospitalizations as a fraction of cases. So 5009/51.5 = 97.3 is an underestimate of hospitalizations per 1 case/100k population. 12000 / 97.3 = 123 cases per 100k population; thus, if CA sees 123 cases per 100k population, a 14-day average of 12k hospitalizations is all but assured. Moreover, in addition to this being an underestimate based on assuming 7 days between cases and hospitalizations, it's also likely an underestimate because cases to date have been skewed towards younger segments of the population. Because US cases are currently 1.6x last year's peak but have not yet peaked, I don't see how CA can escape seeing more than 123 cases per 100k population = 1.1x last year's peak and hence a 14-day average of 12k hospitalizations. And I don't see how this won't happen before Feb 1, as cases are soaring and will likely reach a 7-day average of 123 per 100k population in about 1 week.

Assume hospitalizations lag cases by at least 7 days. Base on England's experience so far, it's likely that the 7-day average of cases/day will peak at more than double last winter's peak of ~109 per 100k population. So if the hospital census at 30/100k is 4137, and if cases do reach double last year's cases, then it would not be unreasonable to expect the peak number hospitalized to reach at least 4137 / 30 * 109 * 2 = 30k. Will cases rise so high? I don't know, but I don't see why CA should be so special as to escape at least very high cases. And I do think it will happen very soon, perhaps within a couple weeks. As hospitalizations generally lag case by 7-10 days, I think a peak in hospitalizations should be reached in late January, possibly early February. Last year, the 7-day average of hospitalizations peaked on Jan 14, and cases peaked January 9 (at the tail end of a data reporting issue, so the actual peak could have been a couple days earlier). I think it's reasonable to expect Omicron cases to peak by mid Jan at the latest and then hospitalizations to peak most likely in the 2nd half of January. There's a lot of uncertainty in my mind about how high hospitalizations will go, but somewhere in the range 12k-30k+ seems possible to me. Also, Ontario's hospitalizations just ticked up, too: https://covid19-sciencetable.ca/ontario-dashboard/#riskbyvaccinationstatus\nTheir apparent low value recently was probably a reporting issue from the holidays. I was wondering why they had seemed so low. I think Ontario's hospitalizations may reach a comparable hospitalization benchmark within 2-3 weeks.

Reinfection is associated with approximately a 50-60% reduction in hospitalisation risk compared with primary infections. However, assuming only 33% of true reinfections are identified as such, corrected estimates suggest lower reduction in Omicron hospitalisation compared with Delta (ranging from approximately 0-30% depending on the data subset), and a higher reduction in the risk of\nhospitalisation associated with reinfection (of approximately 55-70%).\"\nhttps://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/mrc-gida/2021-12-22-COVID19-Report-50.pdf The whole report is worth reading. The upshot: Omicron does appear to be linked to a lower risk of hospitalization than Delta: 15-20% reduced risk for any hospitalization, ~41% reduced risk for hospitalization lasting 1 day or more. Moreover, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection does offer substantial protection against hospitalization compared to people who have never been infected. Without any previous immunity, the severity of Omicron is estimated to be about 70-100% of that of Delta. And the situation with the vaccines is complicated. I think this study is quite relevant to the question because the English population is very similar to the US population. And whatever one thinks of this group's *projections*, about which opinions vary, this is fairly straightforward data analysis. Also, I think this study is more relevant than some other statistics being quoted recently, e.g., from South Africa, that don't take into account how much more rapidly Omicron spreading. South African data do show a large reduction in the risk of hospitalizaiton, but again, I think data from the UK and other Western countries with similar population age structures, health status, Covid exposure histories and vaccination status will shed more light on what to expect in the US. A claim is also being made from data in Scotland that Omicron is far milder, based on 14 hospitalizations; that number is simply too small to draw conclusions from. How do the results of this study translate into this question? The numbers are still small, and the data are still uncertain. But it suggests that there are only going to be ~41% fewer hospitalizations lasting 1+ day with Omicron than with Delta. Moreover, given that Omicron cases are rising so fast, these hospitalizations are going to be stacked more on top of each other than was seen with Delta. Also, some data coming out of France suggests that ICU stays may be about 1 week there with Omicron, shorter than with Delta. I suspect this question will really turn on how high cases are going to go in CA by the 3rd week of January. There's considerable uncertainty in my mind about that.\n@Anneinak"], [12694, "2021-12-22T18:32:34Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [99993, "2021-12-22T17:02:24Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [86607, "2021-12-22T15:47:16Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.9], "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-22/omicron-has-80-lower-risk-of-hospitalization-new-study-shows?srnd=premium"], [34959, "2021-12-22T15:44:51Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.75], ""], [101187, "2021-12-22T11:15:13Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [103429, "2021-12-22T04:47:16Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95], "Despite The WHO\u2019s December 17th Technical Brief on the Omicron variant, South Africa is still the strongest model of future outcomes.

Estimates tending to put hospitalization/case for omicron at least 70% relative to delta. Combined, we might expect hospitalization to be about 82% of the previous peak of 22k = 18k. Exacerbating this is the fact that it is winter in California but summer in S.A., and that California's population is older than S.A.. Mitigating it is the fact that California's vax rate is 2-3x as high, and that omicron hospital stays are discharged faster than in previous waves. I'm thinking that California's fully vaxxed + boosted rate of 42% is going to be pretty significant here given S.A. has almost no boosters yet. Fully boosted offers 80% protection against omicron infection (even more against hospitalizatoin), while prior infection or 2 dose vax is only 20%, so that's maybe an extra 60% of the 42% boosted Californians who will not get sick over the baseline (taking the conservative assumption that natural immunity is extremely high in South Africa due to prior waves of virus) = 25% reduction. This knocks 18k to 13.5k. I would imagine there are also a lot of people who are convalescent and have had a dose of vaccine, which also puts them at about 80% protection. Harder to model that, however it should also give California a huge leg up on South Africa. With the onset and peak of the wave happening quite quickly, the max daily cases is high but the total infected from start to finish could be less (area under the curve). Combined with relatively fast hospital discharge this means that total hospitalized in a given moment will be lower than previous waves, by how much I'm not sure. All this to say that the doomer takes circulating seem very exaggerated to me. I could see a world where seasonal winter effects mean California has an epic spike in cases that dwarfs South Africa's summertime omicron spike, leading to huge hospitalizations. But there is also a huge amount of vax+boosted and recovered+vaxxed immunity in California that doesn't exist in South Africa and accounting for that should give some peace of mind"], [38, "2021-12-21T01:59:07Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.8, 0.2], ""], [22689, "2021-12-21T00:49:52Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.9], ""], [96828, "2021-12-20T20:42:49Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.47, 0.53], "Slight step to just above a consensus aid and below my previous forecast.

So roughly 14% higher and 60% faster.\nThe main uncertainty for me is not whether it will happen (I think it will) but whether it will be a few days earlier or later than 31st Jan. If hospitalised cases involve lengthy stays and cases climb very quickly, then it looks like the last week of Jan will be met, but a slower rise and shorter stays should smooth the curve and delay the peak a week or so. \nIt now seems established that full vaccination plus a booster is the only way to maintain significant immunity against Omicron. California opened boosters to all residents in mid-November after prioritising the elderly for 2 months, but uptake has actually been better among younger age groups, and generally far lower than hoped and expected (something like 15-20%). So as a generalisation the more elderly with lower immunity are now more likely to need longer hospitalisation. \nComparing with Canada's current situation of escalating cases within the context of much higher vaccination levels (76.2% of total population full dosed, compared to 67.4% in California), and increasing booster uptake, the speed of hospitalisation in California could change very rapidly. Median age may be a few years younger in California (36.5 against 40.1 in Ontario for example), but the lower immunity is perhaps more critical.

If someone showed me the graphs of cases and hospitalizations for CA and told me it was for, say, some province in Canada, a completely new question, what would I think? I would think, Omicron is coming. The wave will be higher than last year's winter wave. It will likely peak around the third week in January nationally. It will peak in different places at different times, but Omicron is so contagious that it likely won't peak anywhere in \"Canada\" later than the first week of Feb or so. Aside from the question of when cases will peak, with exponential case growth, even if slowed a bit with some mitigations, cases will get really high in January. I can't imagine it going otherwise.

But I do expect CA's peak to be much higher than its Delta peak because 1) Omicron is more contagious, 2) it will be winter, and 3) the population has very little immunity. But looking at this more closely, I don't see how Omicron cases won't reach ~50 cases/100k population, which, if this were Delta, would correspond to ~12k hospitalizations.

Given all of the above information, it took 30 days to surpass the 12,000 mark last winter when measured from our initial reading of 3,932 on 11/16/20. We had 3,906 on 8/3/21 and 9/14/21 is 42 days away from that date. We will be close with hitting the 12,000 mark if the numbers fade a bit. I suspect it might take 37-40 days to hit it this time, which is barely squeaking into the 9/15 deadline. Not sure how we'd ever see the end of October without 12,000 unless people radically changed behavior.\n"], [98850, "2021-08-12T18:31:55Z", [0.94, 0.06, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "Comment deleted on Aug 12, 2021 06:32PM UTC"], [100273, "2021-08-12T15:48:50Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.6, 0.3, 0.0], "Swag."], [98345, "2021-08-12T15:33:04Z", [0.7, 0.2, 0.03, 0.03, 0.04], "Hedging my estimates slightly."], [98345, "2021-08-12T15:29:42Z", [0.7, 0.25, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0], "The last time we were at these numbers (late Nov 2020), it took about 2 weeks to go from 7k to >12k.

The most-recently reported 14-day hospitalization average is 5,171 (8/9/21). \nToo soon to say if new COVID cases in Calif. have definitively started dropping from recent 8/1/21 and 8/5/21 surges of 33,407 and 14,402 respectively, but the most recent reported new cases numbers were 9,925 (8/10) and 10,425 (8/8).

FWIW: Trying to sketch out one possible worse (vs. worst)-case shorter-term scenario: IF new cases remain steady going forward at around 10,000 per day for the next 30 days, but the reported average number of daily hospitalizations immediately increases a marked (arbitrary) 50% over (each of) the next 30 days, to an average of 305 new hospitalizations/day (recent avg. 203/day X 1.5), AND the current (8/11/21) number of hospitalized (7.007) does not change, we could reach a total of 12,000+ hospitalized patients in about 17 days (8/28/21) from today.
