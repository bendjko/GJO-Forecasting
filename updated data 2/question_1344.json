Either a vote or delay. Which is it?  Clinton\u2019s impeachment came after 14 hours of debate over two days; somewhat of a baseline. The Democrats are not interested in debate and will try to limit debate. The Republicans will try to stall the vote, but ultimately will be unable to block the vote. Thus, there will be another R vs D throwdown. Will the debate be more or less than 14 hours? I suppose because the Democrats set the rules, they will aim for limited debate.  The reason I am still at zero and not at the other end of the forecast continuum (i.e. >95%) is I believe there is the same amount of uncertainty on both sides of the coin. I have been at zero for some time, and see no compelling reason to switch - yet. It's still really a coin toss about timing. Censure is out at this point. You can be sure, that if I can forecast a vote in December, I will switch my forecast faster than greased lightning.

There is must-pass (and some want-to-pass) legislation that requires Senate approval and President's signature by year end.

Trump and Senate Republicans are saying publicly that they want impeachment passed ASAP. Cons: if there is agreement it would typically be at the 11th hour. there don't seem to be many signs I can see of the sides coming together on a plan.\n2) Agree/2020: D&R delay impeachment vote into 2020 in order to get other items done: 30%\n3) No agreement/2019: D&R deadlock and cannot agree on any of the above and D press ahead with passing articles without agreement on the other items: 35% Pros: That seems to be the train we're on. D Base is demanding it. Passing impeachment could reduce Trump's negotiating power. This could simply mean that the impeachment and shutdown talks aren't linked. Cons: Why would the Democrats not use this as a bargaining chip? \n4) No agreement/2020: D&R deadlock and D extend articles into 2020; 15%. Pros: this would appear to make sense if the Democrats believe that impeachment is a useful bargaining chip in the ongoing discussions on the other items. Cons: there is no real evidence to suggest that this option is in play.  At the top level I'm calling the odds of some kind of a agreement by the end of 2019 something like 50/50. However, these debates normally take up to the 11th (or 13th) hour which would not give enough time for passage of articles.  I don't have any solid intellectual basis for the odds above so I just spitballed it. Maybe a useful reference class would be past funding/shutdown votes.

Passing articles in December passes control of the process to the Senate. Are the Democratic House Members ready for this? I think it will be hard for them to let go. It is sticky for them. They will have to be sure that they have more to gain by passing articles than by not passing them. I don't see a strong signal on this point yet.  *The Democrats may calculate that passing articles in December will damage the President's case. However, he is calling their bluff by encouraging the House to pass articles quickly to that the Senate trial can get underway.  *Republicans are running ads in the districts of vulnerable House members. Passing articles won't stop this. *Democrats have to be absolutely sure that all Democratic House Members will fall in line and vote for articles of impeachment. This seems sure, but they have to check and double-check. It would be embarrassing and counterproductive to have a couple jump ship. They must also be considering whether they can get any Republicans to flip. One could think that either of these reasons would drive the Democrats to delay if they can get a stronger more compelling vote. I don't know if they can, but it is worth considering.  *The polls showing support for impeachment have hardly changed. The House public hearings haven't changed minds. I don't think more public meetings will change any minds. This supports voting on articles in December unless the House Democrats believe that they can get the attention of voters in January and persuade some.  *The next Democratic debate is scheduled or December 19. Which candidates will benefit the most from a December 19 or earlier impeachment versus January? Is this relevant? *There is a 7% probability that the Senate will remove President Trump from office (See Crowd Forecast from today @ https://www.gjopen.com/questions/1290-when-will-donald-trump-cease-to-be-president-of-the-united-states). This creates the circularity in the question of why now in December rather than January or later? Given the low probability of removal by the Senate, it seems more beneficial to the Democrats to draw out the process longer as this has the better opportunity to harm President Trump's chances or reelection.  I am probably heavily into Vizzini-style reasoning, so will stop here. Any slick pundit would forecast this question as close to 50% as possible, as this is the safest zone in prediction markets because you can always explain why you were a few % off if the outcome goes the other way.

Lunden Roberts, the 28-year-old mother, will have to reveal how much she earned in tips at Mpire\u2019s strip club in Washington, D.C., where she met Hunter, 49. \u201cI anticipate paternity as well as custody, support, and visitation being established at our next hearing,\u201d the judge announced. \u201cI will do what I believe is in the best interest of the child,\u201d he added. He is expected to decide the case at the hearing on Jan. 7. The baby\u2019s sex has not yet been revealed. Biden worked at Burisma from April 2014 to April 2019, and claimed to earn $50,000 a month. McSpadden requested information for the past five years. Hunter Biden is also involved in the controversial impeachment of President Donald Trump. He was appointed to Burisma\u2019s board of directors when his father served as vice president, with no experience or knowledge in the field of energy. Hunter Biden\u2019s business in Ukraine caused concern to George Kent, deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, who alerted President Obama\u2019s administration in 2015 about possible conflicts of interest, but he was ignored. Kent testified before Congress Oct. 15 about the activities of then-Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son, according to The Washington Post."], [1333, "2019-12-06T19:01:11Z", [0.97], ""], [75863, "2019-12-06T16:50:44Z", [0.7], ""], [1333, "2019-12-06T16:48:10Z", [0.98], "@cdob63 - Your Virginia prognostication was on.

PredictIt has been pretty much flat, trading in a range from around 35% to 48% since the beginning of September. 3.1M shared traded GJOpen started out lower in the beginning of October and has drifted upward, now running more-or-less in that same range. 173 forecasters, 551 total forecasts. Based on the much larger participation numbers and the fact that they seem to have eventually converged, I'll take PredictIt as the more accurate gauge of the consensus of forecasters: ~45% and holding steady since September. So my question is: Since early September a lot has changed and the odds remain hovering in the middle. That tells me that despite all the ups and downs of the daily news, forecasters are still, as a group, about where they were in September. That seems odd to me.  Clearly there will always be a bias traceable to people's underlying political beliefs. Given that the country is more-or-less evenly split, I'm going to guess that pushes the result towards the middle unless there is overwhelming evidence one way or the other. Within that middle range it will be driven by the daily news (i.e. noise) and by people thinking through rational theories.  What are the dominant theories? I think most arguments fall into one of these buckets:  1) YES: The train has left the station and isn't stoppable now. The Democratic base is so fired up / so convinced that this is their moral duty that Pelosi has to push through articles regardless of what the Senate will do. If they don't push back on Trump then voters will punish them in the fall.\n        For: Democrats have thus far kept on message, stayed focused on one issue and stayed on schedule. This is what the news media is saying and seems to be center of gravity opinion among the pundits on various sides of the political spectrum. History (e.g. Benghazi) shows that you can keep starting new investigations forever despite a lack of public support and maybe eventually the public will come around. \n        Against: Passing articles that are rejected by the Senate may leave the Democrats at the mercy of an uncontrollable president; better to keep investigating and keep him against the ropes.\n         Odds: 60% change that this turns out to be correct\n2) YES: Democrats feel that passing articles now (before 2020) will insulate them from accusations that they are passing articles in an election year which might boomerang on them in red and purple districts in November. \n         For: This is an argument being promoted mostly on the right (of course, because it isn't favorable for the left)\n         Against: perhaps true, but this isn't the primary driving factor in determining an outcome\n         Odds: 5%. I don't think this is driving the dialog\n3) NO: Giving away control of the news cycle is too valuable. They will keep investigating wherever the new facts lead them until Trump is out of office one way or another. In mid to late December they will discover \"new\" and \"shocking\" evidence that \"forces\" them to push the investigation into the new year. etc. etc.\n       For: If they pass impeachment and it loses in the Senate, it seems harder to get public support for future investigations. Controlling the news cycle through much of 2020 seems like a strong strategic position to be in coming up to an election.\n       Against: There isn't much hard evidence to support this theory as of now. The democrats could start investigations. \n       Odds: 30%\n4) NO: The fact that the Senate won't convict makes some democrats (especially in red to purple districts) in the house unwilling to vote to support impeachment so it might not pass. Pelosi cannot take the chance of having the vote fail in the house based on Democratic votes or even having a significant minority vote against it.\n        Pros and Cons: this is math and presumably other people have done that math and concluded that this isn't a major issue since it isn't discussed much. \n        Odds: 5%\n5) Are there others?  Thus far I have been most in camp #3. However, laying it out it does seem that #1 has the preponderance of the evidence. Am I falling prey to Plan Continuance Bias?

Next will be the final draft and then B(Judicial committee delivery) will happen. This can be done within <5 calendar days.  As for C (More hearings) are actually already going on, but sedate stuff. Experts are being called in to testify what is a high crime and misdemeanor, etc.  Trump himself has been invited to participate, but he is highly unlikely to show or send an attorney as his strategy here is to de-legitimize the process.\nThe gotcha I fear is if any key witnesses will volunteer to cross the line and come in to shed light in the dark corners.

It is clear to attentive legal minds, partisan or not, that DJT extorted Ukraine, abused his position, and obstructed justice. I suspect articles of impeachment have already been drafted. ie. Once the killer confesses and 17 witnesses testifies against him, any inquest panel will have already begun the paperwork.  This can happen within 3 days.  So that's 8 days plus any wildcard of C.  That gives us 4 days for a House vote. Doable, but edgy. On the note of censure, I entertained that for awhile. But the Dems know that DJT doesn't respect any form of accountability. I doubt DJT could spell censure. The House is playing for keeps, the Dems and half the GOP know DJT is unfit for office and should be removed. So Censure is <2% chance IMHO. The Dems have past the Rubicon and are going to impeach now that the smoke has cleared and it is obvious DJT is guilty.  @Anneinak @Emil You both have come up the scale to join me.

The report is to be prepared in consultation with the other two investigating committees: Foreign Affairs and Oversight. TO JUDICIARY COMMITTEE\nOnce complete, Representative Adam Schiff, the chair of the Intelligence Committee, is then meant to transmit the report, along with relevant evidentiary material and member views, to the Judiciary Committee and to release it publicly. Legislative sources had hoped the Intelligence Committee could complete its report and send it to the Judiciary Committee before the Nov. 28 U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, though it is unclear if they will succeed. MORE HEARINGS?\nThe House resolution has authorized the Judiciary Committee at this stage to conduct more proceedings if needed, including more hearings, that allow Trump and his counsel to participate. The ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, Doug Collins, can also subpoena witnesses, records and other material but only with the concurrence of the chairman, Democrat Jerrold Nadler. If the chairman and ranking member do not agree, the Republican can ask for a full committee vote. TO IMPEACH, OR NOT TO IMPEACH?\nThe Judiciary Committee has to decide if there is enough evidence to impeach.

It is unlikely the populace would stand for another round of divisive impeachment proceedings, as an ongoing matter, unless there is an extremely serious and obvious charge (such as direct evidence of taking bribes as was the case with Vice President Spiro Agnew in the early 1970s).\"  I would argue that this would create an even bigger problem for the Democrats in the second term than in the first.

TO JUDICIARY COMMITTEE\nOnce complete, Representative Adam Schiff, the chair of the Intelligence Committee, is then meant to transmit the report, along with relevant evidentiary material and member views, to the Judiciary Committee and to release it publicly. Legislative sources had hoped the Intelligence Committee could complete its report and send it to the Judiciary Committee before the Nov. 28 U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, though it is unclear if they will succeed.

The ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, Doug Collins, can also subpoena witnesses, records and other material but only with the concurrence of the chairman, Democrat Jerrold Nadler. If the chairman and ranking member do not agree, the Republican can ask for a full committee vote. TO IMPEACH, OR NOT TO IMPEACH?\nThe Judiciary Committee has to decide if there is enough evidence to impeach. If it concludes that impeachment is warranted, the panel would draft articles of impeachment against Trump for a full House vote. OVER TO THE SENATE\nIf the House votes to impeach, the process then moves to the Republican-controlled Senate. Its options are to vote to dismiss the charges against Trump or to hold a trial.

The thing that catches my attention is that the Democrats are being very disciplined in just sticking to the Ukraine call matter and resisting what must be very powerful pulls down various other lines of investigation. That approach does not fit well with my prior mental model of what's going on. I assume Pelosi has a good answer but they've done a good job of keeping it out of the headlines. From where I sit on the sidelines that looks like an odd strategy. Here are the most likely game plans that Pelosi might be following that could explain this narrow approach: \n1) Pelosi plans to pass impeachment quickly on this narrow issue and get a quick non-conviction in the Senate, then open a new investigation in the new year. This approach would infuriate the Republicans and please the Democratic base. Both of those are good things if you're Pelosi. However, it seems to me that it would be risky for independents unless the Democrats know of a really strong line of investigation (tax returns?) that isn't really on the popular radar at the moment; OR \n2) Plan to get through this round of interviews, see where the polls and facts are and then, depending on the mood of the county, either decide to push for an impeachment vote immediately; do another round of interviews and dig deeper and have an impeachment vote in the new year; or open up some new line of a broader investigation and push this out well into 2020. Both of these scenarios seem plausible to me. I think both scenarios have risks for the Democrats. Scenario 2 seems like the more likely to allow them to continue to control the news cycle and minimize risk. I think there's a 10% chance that option 1 is in play, 60% chance that option 2 is in play and 30% chance that some other option I'm not considering is going on behind the scenes.

It\u2019s easy to dislike Trump, I get it. And many New Yorkers do but...\n. I was also surprised by how many New Yorkers said so many positive things about him (more than I expected).\n. Equally, was surprised by how many Dem New Yorkers said in effect \u201cI don\u2019t like him but he is our president...\u201d\n. He gave a speech to Economic Forum at 6 & 53 (Hilton, where I was) which was well received by attendees. He was fairly eloquent and informed (if a little loose with truth of some facts :) )\n. Guess above points don\u2019t sell newspapers or fuel the partisan politics repeated back to us via media around world. I say all this and note consistency of his support. Most presidents experience swings of 40-60% re approval ratings. Trump\u2019s has never been high, but nor has it been low (again by comparison). understanding Pelosi and company are bright/understand how things work. By lowering bar of evidence to be considered, they have  lowered it for future Dems as well. I continue to believe in this timeline - although much negative info coming out - impeachment won\u2019t happen. Too much fun for Dems to draw it out and hope to inflict longer term damage closer to election cycle. Removes the spotlight from their candidates. For the record. I am not American. I was a Bernie man (why no consequences for Clinton stealing nomination from him?). If Bloomberg enters, he, Sanders, Klobuchar, or Buttigieg would be my preferred challengers.

However, allow me to briefly lay out an alternative hypothesis and I would love to hear your thoughts:  It seems very unlikely that the Senate will convict and Pelosi knows this. I'm not sure that passing articles of impeachment and then losing the Senate vote is good for Democrats because: \n     a) they then have to drop the matter and can't keep drip-drip-dripping it out there for the next year which is likely to lead to new perhaps unexpected revelations that are much more damaging to Trump; and\n     b) they risk appearing to swing voters and their base that they \"lost\" The democratic base is demanding action.  The current investigation is allowing the Democrats to control more of the new cycle than they have for the last several years, and it's keeping their most vocal and extreme members out of the spotlight and thereby limiting electoral damage in 2020. A reasonable strategic response by Pelosi to the above factors (or \"facts\" if one agrees with me on them as facts) would be to keep threatening to pass articles soon, but keep finding reasons to delay for another week or two and let the process keeping dripping and controlling news cycles. \"Q: When are we going? A: Real soon!\"  Democratic leaders' behavior appears to me to be consistent with either the hypothesis you lay out or mine above. They are responding to that pressure by making statements about timing that sound concrete but which are ultimately aspirational and don't commit them to do anything by a specific time.  If so, then I wouldn't hold my breath for articles by EOY.  What do you think?

The timeline has come into sharper focus . . .  Congressional investigators, led by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), APPEAR to have wrapped up the last of 15 private depositions of current and former Trump administration officials. . . . \n. . .  \u201cI THINK, without being hasty, again, but being expeditious and deliberative, that the House OUGHT TO SET for themselves a TARGET of having dealt with this in the Intelligence Committee and Foreign Affairs and Oversight and the Judiciary Committee and on the floor by Christmas,\u201d Rep. Denny Heck (D-Wash.), a member of the Intelligence Committee, told CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Situation Room\u201d on Thursday night. \u201cThat's a TOUGH schedule. But it's a doable schedule, given where we're at and all the work that's been done thus far,\u201d Heck said. There are OTHER SIGNS that Democrats are charging toward a December floor vote to make Trump just the third president in U.S. history to be impeached.\n. . . \nAfter watching their Mueller and Russia probes get bogged down in never-ending court battles, Democrats APPEAR to be moving on without testimony from those key witnesses rather than engage in another lengthy lawsuit against the administration. \u201cWe're not going to delay our work. That would merely allow these witnesses and the White House to succeed with their goal, which is to delay, deny, obstruct,\u201d Schiff recently said. IF Democrats can stick to their aggressive timetable, they COULD be on track to reach the end of their impeachment inquiry in the days right before Christmas. Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) and other Democrats insist that they\u2019ll take as long as the process requires, but MANY HOPE it can be wrapped up before the presidential campaign begins in earnest with the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3. To speed things along, Democrats have indicated their witness list for the public hearings will be limited. That means they will only bring in people who offered the most detailed or firsthand knowledge of events during earlier closed-door appearances. \u201cThe Majority does not intend to request public testimony from every witness who previously testified in depositions or interviews as part of the impeachment inquiry,\u201d Schiff wrote in a letter to Rep. Devin Nunes (Calif.), the top Republican on the Intelligence panel, offering the opportunity for the minority to request public witnesses. Democrats have veto power over any GOP requests. The public hearings will start with a bang on Wednesday . . . \n. . . \nThose three hearings will be followed by second week of public testimony before Congress adjourns for a weeklong break for the Thanksgiving holiday.  SOMETIME in early December, Schiff \u2014 along with the chairs of other two investigating committees \u2014 is EXPECTED to forward a report and recommendations for articles of impeachment to Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), who is in charge of the third phase of impeachment. The veteran lawmaker will be tasked with figuring out which articles get sent to the House floor for a vote. Nadler also COULD hold public hearings, where the president and his counsel could be present, though IT REMAINS UNCLEAR whether the Judiciary panel plans to take those steps. \u201cIT DEPENDS ON, does the president or minority want to call witnesses who haven't been fact witnesses, who haven't been testified already. I don't know that. \u2026 WE'LL HAVE TO SEE,\u201d Nadler said on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cAll in with Chris Hayes.\u201d From there, the 41-member Judiciary Committee would draft articles of impeachment \u2014 likely focusing on things like abuse of power and obstruction of justice \u2014 and vote to send them to the House floor. Only then would all House lawmakers be able to vote on impeachment, POTENTIALLY the week before Christmas. From there the impeachment process would move over to the Senate, which under current rules would be required to conduct a trial that could take weeks to complete. Both parties have a political incentive for an expeditious trial that could arrive as soon as January: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) wants to quickly acquit Trump so Republicans can shift to other priorities like confirming judges; Democrats don\u2019t want their 2020 presidential hopefuls, like Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), to get stuck in a lengthy, inside-the-Beltway impeachment trial. One possible complication to the emerging timeline is the fact that lawmakers also need to figure out how to avoid another government shutdown amid the partisan acrimony. Government funding expires on Nov. 21. But given the lack of progress on appropriations \u2014 despite a bipartisan budget deal struck in late July \u2014 congressional leaders are eyeing another stopgap measure to extend funding to sometime in December. That means the House COULD be faced with an impeachment vote just as the threat of another holiday-season shutdown looms.\"\n. . . \n~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:   I've put in CAPS all the qualifiers and conditional words.

Impeaching after June doesn't make sense - it opens one up to the charge, there's an election in 5 months, dear God, why can't you let the American people sort it out by then.  So - the window is now (Nov, till June).   If all the dems want to do is tie up the president - they keep the evidenciary hearings going forever, and just have a constant drip drip drip.   Call this path A.  On the other hand, if they want to impeach, they can attempt to compel discovery via court action, call this path B.  Or they can wave their hands alleging crimes, and try to use Obstruction as the central charge.  Path C.  Path A - drags out the inquiry into June and beyond. \nPath B  - likewise requires legal fights.  No way to do before Jan 1.  Path C, they could do anytime they chose. \nWord from the Hill, was that Pelosi et.al wanted a vote by Thansgiving.   Don't see any possibility of that.

So, if she wants option C, she can have it at any time.  But, as a political operation, she knows right now that there is ZERO chance of getting this through the senate.  So the only value is political / PR.  Now, she derives substantial political benefit to the left side of her base just by having an inquisition, er impeachment.  But to move beyond that, she needs hearings to try to sell the idea to the American public (1). Once the hearing moves to the Senate, she is no longer in control of the debate - the republicans are.    They control the timing, the airspace, the pacing, everything.   I think they need significant weeks of air time - minimum 2, to make the case to the public, before the republicans get their rebuttal. So, if the hearings conclude by Nov 14 , and the Judiciary committee drafts up articles of impeachment by Nov 21, and they have 2 weeks of hearings after the Tday break,  this puts a vote just in Mid December.  But this leaves no time for budget debates. So, if this were solely up to the House, I would give it 40-50% that Pelosi would push the impeachment through by 12/31.  Appropriations floor fights could take 0-4 weeks.  Which means 50% miss the 12/31 deadline.   So I'm going to cut the baby in half and go with 25%.  Thanks @annieinak for pushing me hard enough to make a prediction.

However, the question is when. And this is where I am not sure I agree with forecasts by @Prognosticating-Beek on the one hand (bullish) and @Anneinak (bearish) on the other. So I am moving from 25%. Mainly, there is very little clarity over the timeline.  Interviews by NYT and WP [2] report a number of Congressmen referring to an unofficial December goal for a vote. At the same time Pelosi and top officials on the Judiciary and Intelligence committees insist that there \"is no deadline\" and on the importance of finding out the truth, if you will, even if that takes longer.  Some including @Anneinak have made the argument that there are a limited number of sitting days in the House before end of the year. I don't think that is much of a constraint as most of the work will take place in the Intelligence (and partially Judiciary) committee and by the staffs of the Congressmen on that committee. It is easy to imagine that if the will is there, the work will be expedited. The House sitting days are only relevant for the final impeachment vote. But as long as the Judiciary committee can report Articles of Impeachment before the last possible sitting day, a vote can still pass in the full House before the end of the year. Some major factors:\n- will courts be involved to give the House ability to force government officials to testify? So far Pelosi et al have wanted to avoid this as it will take weeks and months.  \"Representative Adam B. Schiff, the House Intelligence Committee chairman who is leading the inquiry, said that Democrats would not wait to fight the Trump administration in court as it moves to block key witness testimony\" [3] - Will a testimony by John Bolton be seen as a sine qua non? Then the House will likely have to go to the courts to force a testimony (Bolton lawyer says he will not testify voluntarily [1]. Unless I am missing something (maybe I am), I see a Bolton testimony as necessitating court involvement. - I am still leaning toward 'no' because of the unexpected number of people who have come to testify and have something relevant to contribute to the fact-finding procedure. The more Democrats drudge up, the more it lengthens the proceedings, is the theory here. I am also leaning toward 'no' similarly because processes such as these take time (I have mentioned before the comparison class with Clinton's and Nixon's investigations). - Now that Republicans have power to invite testimonies, will they try to sabotage the process by unnecessarily dragging it out?

Barring any changes to the congressional calendar, there are only 41calendar days left to prepare and put an article of impeachment before the house in their last session of the year.\n\nHistory of previous inquiries\nClinton's impeachment inquiry took 72 calendar days, and Nixon's inquiry took 184 days (until he resigned). But, there is a difference between Trump's and Clinton's impeachment inquiry. Clinton's inquiry was preceded by the Starr-report (the result of an investigation that started four years prior). The Nixon inquiry was also preceded by a year-long investigation into the break-in in the DNC. At the moment, the impeachment inquiry into Trump seems more like a two in one (investigation and inquiry) into questions about abuse of power in foreign relations with Ukraine. Trump's inquiry started on September 24th. Investigators would at most have had 79 days, to pass the article before the end of the year. For a two in one inquiry, 79 days seems too short.\n\nThe scope of the inquiry\nIt is unclear (to me) how many grounds for impeachment will be brought together in the articles. How far will the commission go to prove obstruction? Will they aggregate findings from the Mueller report or from other investigations in order to substantiate the charges? Reading and agreeing can take a lot of time.\nHow many people will be heard? A number of people have been mentioned that could contribute to the proceedings but for whom it is unclear whether they are legally allowed to speak out (e.g. Bolton). Resolving this takes time.\nAs the whole world is watching this high stakes impeachment, there is great pressure to be precise and complete. Exhaustiveness takes time.\n\nTiming of the public hearings\nPublic hearings have been announced to start November 11th. As there have been accusations recently that the inquiry is nontransparent, I expect a series of public hearings (\"a circus\").  A lead time of about one month for all the public hearings seems short given the number and the stature of the people involved. After the public hearings, it will take some time to bring together all the information into the articles of impeachment.\n\nConclusion\nWith everything that remains to be done, the chance of the house passing an article of impeachment against Trump before the new year is already very small. I simply do not see a compelling reason (Am I overlooking something?) for a very speedy process to make sure a vote on the articles of impeachment takes place on December 12 (or before).  The need for quality of the inquiry pushes the vote further into the future. The desire of some within the democratic party to influence public opinion with the narrative of impeachment also lengthens the process. \nIn my opinion, there is no chance that the vote on the articles of impeachment takes place before the new year."], [32258, "2019-10-29T22:00:27Z", [0.08], ""], [40584, "2019-10-29T20:15:06Z", [0.01], "I lost track of this question for a while and have not updated my estimate in too long. Reducing my vote down to reflect the passage of time.  Here are some thoughts working backwards from the endgame: \n* If you're a Republican from a strongly red district and you vote to impeach/convict Trump (or even voice modest support for that idea) you are in serious trouble in your next primary. There are enough up for election in 2020 that I just can't envision this being a smart political move for most Senators. Even for those who may have serious concerns about Trump's impact on the party and/or county, their concern will be more focused on making sure that 1) they hold their own seats; and 2) Republicans hold the Senate.\n=> I can't envision a reasonable scenario in which conviction would garner a 2/3 majority in the Senate.  So, this question comes down to whether Democrats are willing to vote for impeachment in the house; and if so whether they do so by the end of 2019. Given that they can do the same math I'm doing above, virtually all Democrats (and perhaps a small handful of Republicans) might vote for articles of impeachment if ALL of the following were true: \n* 5% A majority of red-district Democrats felt that voting for impeachment would help more than it hurt their individual chances of re-election (or they felt so strongly about the issue personally that they would be willing to risk their political careers on a vote of conscious); \n* 20% Virtually all purple-district Democrats felt it would help them.\n* 30% The Democratic leadership supported the effort in the belief that it would help hold the house and perhaps win the Senate. I don't think they will come to this conclusion. \n* 10% all of the above will happen by the end of the year \n=> I'm going to round it up to 1% I think a smarter approach is: \nDemocrats: I don't think this is a winning issue for the Democrats but on the other hand their base is demanding action so the can't just give it lip service. They need to be seen to be doing something. So: formalize the impeachment process and drag it out for months, working towards the goal of having Trump lose the next general election rather than impeachment and also trying to damage his allies in their elections. Wait until after the 2020 election for impeachment in the hopes that either 1) Trump loses anyway so it's a moot point; or 2) Democrats strengthen their hand in the Senate and the calculation above changes (though not by much). Republicans: This is a winning issue and their base insists that they fight for every inch. So: continue to de-legitimize the impeach inquiry process. argue that the impeachment process is a distraction from more important issues facing the country and is not being handled fairly.

By 12/31/19 at 40%.  It is my belief that the demographic of GJO has a more diverse demographic and the Republicans forecasting just don't think its going to happen as they are told it is a witch hunt and have not read the transcripts, or the ambassador's notes which aren't just a smoking gun but a smoking arsenal.  So without the facts, the Republican forecasters here are under estimating how damaging this is for the trump administration.  While on PI, people are wagering real money and giving it long and hard thought about the odds.    Ironically, on the flipside, Moody's Analytics has a model as well as the 13 Keys to the Whitehouse model both predict Trump re-election and not by a small margin. However, Moody's model doesn't ingest any scandal component, and the 13 Keys model, can only have scandal affect 1/13th of the outcome at best. So both models have grave limitations in outlier cases such as this. I wonder how they would have forecasted Nixon after the scandal broke?

Limited number of legislative days for the House. This concerns me the most.  This decreases the chance an impeachment will happen by 12/31.\n2. Delaying for impeachment polls in Swing states to come up to speed with the message that high crimes have occurred.  Pelosi is very aware the public has to be behind any successful impeachment, and the public takes pride in preserving their ignorance of the current events in the world.  This decreases the chance an impeachment will happen by 12/31.\n3. Dems know the public doesn't want this to drag on, they need to act quick. They already have most of what they need and DJT has already effectively given a confession, a transcript, and clearly obstructed justice in a valid investigation.

Finally, some are (at least) suggesting that Democrats be thorough and consider drafting articles beyond the (Trump) Ukraine fiasco (https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-impeachment-needle-may-soon-move-11571352274).  For background, the Clinton impeachment took about 9 1/2 weeks weeks from commencement to impeachment vote in the House (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Bill_Clinton), Nixon's impeachment process was taking considerably longer but then he resigned .  (Small chance Trump could do the same.)  FWIW, (as noted below) the crowd at 'Predictit' currently assigns a significantly higher probability to essentially the same question: https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/4319/Will-Donald-Trump-be-impeached-by-year-end-2019"], [32258, "2019-10-20T20:30:46Z", [0.25], ""], [32258, "2019-10-20T20:26:51Z", [0.15], ""], [11430, "2019-10-20T19:46:07Z", [0.75], ""], [534, "2019-10-20T17:15:52Z", [0.85], "Pelosi has signaled she wants to do it before the end of this calendar year; probably before Thanksgiving."], [29896, "2019-10-20T17:07:14Z", [0.2], ""], [15196, "2019-10-20T15:40:12Z", [0.0], ""], [32258, "2019-10-19T22:55:06Z", [0.05], "Trump keeps giving more ammunition to impeach him on and despite news that Democrats want to focus only on the Ukraine scandals, which are thick and enough to impeach, more issues are thrust into our faces.

My guess (and \"guess\" is the operative term here, as I am getting very few helpful hints from folks I know on and around the Hill) is that such a motion won't be passed by the full House before at least April or May, and possibly never.

It keeps coming back. I definitely struggle with this question. Not much precedent to look at and it seems to be driven by a few strong players (namely Pelosi and Trump). It's hard to try to get a read into their behavior - Pelosi's willingness to go for impeachment and Trump's willingness to do potentially impeachable acts. I think at this point, it is very clear that if Pelosi decides to put up a vote, the House of Representatives would pass an article of impeachment. The key question is will more information about Trump's behavior come out in the short term that necessitates an impeachment vote or will Pelosi decide the time is right and call for a vote with what information the Democrats have.  I think for the both those questions, the answer is probably not prior to January 1, 2020. It is certainly possible more information comes out about Trump's dealings, but I don't think there can be much worse information out there that hasn't been found. I don't think it'll change the timeline that much - in fact if new information comes out it may force Pelosi to recalculate. Probably more importantly, Pelosi and the Democrats have been very cautious and, I would say, political through this process. They haven't rushed into impeachment and seem content to focus on collecting info and having internal conversations for now. They know the senate will almost certainly not convict, so the whole impeachment process seems to be more about optics than anything else, essentially setting the Democrats up so that whoever the select as the nominee is in the best position to beat Trump in the 2020 election. Passing impeachment articles is the big political step, and I'm sure they'll wait till it has maximum impact, which I don't think will be in the next two months.  In addition, there is simply the calendar. As @Anneinak points out, there are only 22 legislative days. Also, putting this news out during the holiday season may dampen it's affect.  For comparison I looked at markets which give this question about a 50/50 chance [1].  The crowd here right now is 65%. I'll up my prediction a bit towards those, but not by too much.
