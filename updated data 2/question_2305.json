Divide the recent value by last year's value: 111.74 / 105.54 = 1.059. Subtract 1: 1.059 - 1 = 0.059. Multiply by 100%: 0.059 * 100% = 5.9%. Feb 22 yoy inflation was 5.9%. To see what the month-on-month (\"mom\") inflation has been, compare the index value of one month to that of the month before.\nExample: Feb 22 index = 111.74, Jan 22 index = 110.70. Divide the recent value by last month's value: 111.74 / 110.70 = 1.009. Subtract 1: 1.009 - 1 = 0.009. Multiply by 100%: 0.009 * 100% = 0.9%. If mom inflation 0.9%, then we find the current month's index value by multiplying the previous month's index value by 1.009.\nExample: Jan 22 index = 110.70. Feb 22 mom inflation is 0.9%. Then Feb 22 index = 111.70 * 1.009 = 111.70. (It's actually 111.74; there's a small rounding error.) If mom inflation is 0.9% one month and 0.8% the next month, then the index gets multiplied by 1.009 * 1.008.\nExample: Feb 22 index value is 111.74. April 22 index value would be 111.74 * 1.009 * 1.008 = 113.65. If inflation were constant every month, then the yoy inflation would be the mom inflation multiplied together 12 times (i.e., to the power of 12).\nExample: If mom inflation were constant at 0.9%, then the index value would be multiplied by 1.009 each month. Then yoy inflation would be (1.009^12 - 1) * 100% = 11.4%. If inflation continued at 0.9% mom through April, the index value would be 1.009 (0.9% inflation for Feb-Mar) * 1.009 (0.9% inflation for Mar-Apr) * 111.74 (the Feb index value) = 113.76. Then yoy inflation for Apr 22 would be (113.76 / 107.14 (Apr 21 value) - 1) * 100% = 6.2%. With yoy inflation at 5.9% for Feb 22, it doesn't make a lot of sense to say we need to \"add\" 1.1% inflation to reach 7.0%. That 5.9% is relative to Feb 21, and our 7.0% in April will need to be relative to Apr 22. And inflation is multiplied, not added. Reaching 7.0% in April 22 is not equivalent to \"adding\" 0.55% inflation in March and April, except in the very loosest sense. To see 7% inflation for Apr 22, the index value would need to be 107.14 (April 21 value) * 1.07 (7% inflation) = 114.64. That would mean that we'd need to see (114.64 / 111.74 (Feb 22 index value) - 1) * 100% = 2.6% inflation from Feb 22 to Apr 22. That's a 2-month period. If inflation were constant throughout this period, we'd need to see the square root of 1.026 = 1.026^(1/2) = 1.013 => 1.3% mom inflation in March and April to reach 7.0% yoy inflation in April 22. To summarize:\n1. Yoy inflation is calculated by comparing this year's index value to last year's index value.\n2. Inflation rates are multiplied together, not added. Index values are multiplied by inflation rates to get new index values.\n3. Feb 22 mom inflation was 0.9%.\n4. To reach 7.0% yoy inflation in Apr 22, we'd need to see approx. 1.3% mom inflation in both March and April (or higher one month and lower the other month). Note that Feb 22 saw 0.9% mom inflation, with nearly all of Feb before the invasion of Ukraine and energy and food price spikes.

A household using 20,000 kilowatt hours (kWh) per year and agreeing a new annual contract in March had to pay a record 3,305 euros ($3,632), equivalent to 16.5 cents/kWh, price comparison portal Check24 said. That is 62% above the monthly price in December. \"Consumers have seen an unprecedented wave of gas price hikes this winter,\" said Steffen Suttner, Managing Director Energy at Check24, pointing to soaring wholesale prices. The Russia-Ukraine war could bring further increases due to uncertainty about the availability of gas, said Check24. Half of Germany's 41.5 million households use gas for heating. The European Gas Spot index at German trading hub THE is up 93% this month from the previous month. Electricity prices are also at record levels. A new 5,000 kWh annual supply contract costs an average of 2,098 euros, or 42 cents/kWh, 23% more than in December, Check24 said. For professional buyers, prices on the EEX bourse this month are 283 euros/MWh, 130% more than in February, which means households face more increases due to utilities' higher purchasing costs, Suttner said.\"\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/energy/german-gas-power-prices-households-new-highs-2022-03-16/ Energy costs in the HICP were up 28.8% yoy for Jan 22, and 32% for Feb 22.\nhttps://tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/inflation-cpi\nSo, given the numbers in the Reuters article above, it's quite possible that household energy costs could even be up by >30% mom for Mar 22."], [99943, "2022-03-17T21:33:11Z", [0.73], ""], [87827, "2022-03-17T21:11:07Z", [0.45], "Taking the outside view I'll roughly base it on since 2021M05 it's grown by 3.1% over 8 months, an average of 0.39% per month.

Goldman's older forecast was a peak of 7.7 in July for the Eurozone (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-10/goldman-sees-euro-area-economy-shrinking-inflation-close-to-8#:~:text=Goldman%20Sachs%20predicts%20euro%2Darea,to%20increase%202.2%25%20in%202023.) but they don't provide a timeline for it. I would expect faster growth in the next 2 months and slowing into the peak before turning back downward though, which would likely put us at 7.0% or higher. The US fed remains hawkish as well (https://www.thestreet.com/markets/stocks-slip-lower-as-markets-re-set-after-hawkish-fed-rate-hike).  The worry for most is the soaring cost of energy, especially the forecasted shortfalls in the oil market due to Russian sanctions mentioned in the BoE article, which will be most acute in the next couple months before OPEC or whoever decides to pump more oil, or new non-Russian sourcing can be found for countries enforcing US sanctions, or demand adjusts downward. There's also worries about large increases in other commodity prices as a result of the Russian invasion, and I don't forecast that resolving any time soon, so those fears will probably materialize.  The main against case here is simply the threshold. If it lands at 6.9%, a forecast for 7.0% is still 100% wrong. Linreg puts it at 7.0% exactly, but most forecasts are for a peak between April and July, and all else equal we expect growth to slow as we approach that peak, not continue linearly. Historically also, months with large jumps tend to be followed by lower or flat growth the next month, and we just had a month with a large jump (0.8%). We need to average 0.55% for the next 2 months to hit 7.0%, so a flatter month in March (if it happens) would make 7.0% much less likely.  Overall, expectations do seem to be for a >7.0% level in April, but the choice of threshold does mean that this will likely be a tight finish, and a close of just below 7.0% needs to be accounted for.

Later edit:\n\"In Euro Area, the inflation rate is calculated using the weighted average of the Harmonised Index of Consumer Price (HICP) aggregates. The main components of the HICP are: food, alcohol and tobacco (19 percent of the total weight), energy (11 percent), non-energy industrial goods (29 percent) and services (41 percent). The HICP aggregates are computed as the weighted average of each country\u2019s HICP components. The weight of a country is its share of household final monetary consumption expenditure in the total of the country\u2019s group. The local HICPs are supplied to the Eurostat by the National Statistical Institutes.\"\nhttps://tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/inflation-cpi With food prices going up globally, and food, energy and other commodity shocks from the Ukraine war, it does seem likely to me that 7.0% will be reached.
