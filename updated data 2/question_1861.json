It seems the Gilt rate creep in UK and bond creep elsewhere has not concerned the BoE. The unanimity of the MPC seems clear about the current course of action - https://bit.ly/3vGdYuS. As the next MPC is 6 May and IMHO there's little likelihood of change in between now and then, as the BoE appears to be hesitant to not move too early on the upside as that may choke off any signs of a recovery, I will retain my forecast. Maintaining the current rate and asset purchases does leave the BoE some room to manoeuvre should the need arise. The flip side, and what the MPC seems to be thinking is that there's likely to be a relatively strong rebound in spending resulting from the vaccination program, the governments support program and the announced schedule for the easing of the lock down / restrictions. There is increasing talk that 'pent up spending' in UK and USA will contribute significantly to this rebound. That may contribute to the BoE's 2% inflation target.

Per meeting, it looks like c, 19% of meetings ever have resulted in rate changes, c. 4% since 2010, but including asset purchases changes that is more like c. 14%. Likely to be 3 meetings between now and then so taking the \"all time\" numbers you would expect a c.46% chance of a monetary policy change, 12% since 2010 and 34% since the start of 2010 including asset purchase changes. Obviously that would cover both tightening and easing, so half those for an easing \"base rate\" (geddit). I would think you anticipate a skew towards easing, over tightening over coming months, but also  a skew towards inaction, so perhaps we say 20% chance of some easing of monetary policy on that basis. But the question then becomes what - I would think you are supposed to be debating 3 options - cutting rates to zero, expanding the Corp and Govt bond buying, or going negative. That could drop the probability of negative rates to c. a third the chance of some easing, for c. 10%.  Another way of looking at it might be that you need two easing decisions to get to negative rates. Given the inflation report is in May, we could look at what is the chance of a rate cut in the 2 meetings until then (upper bound using that 19% would get you to c. 34% changes, so call it 17% easing change) and then 10% of another easing decision getting you to only a 2% chance). Market pricing implies a relatively heavy expectation of an interest rate move if I am reading this right though (https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/stir/mpc-sonia-futures_quotes_globex.html)\nEffectively base rate is priced at 0.5bps post the May meeting. You could read that as market is pricing in a 95% chance of a cut to zero, or the market is pricing in a just under 48% chance of a cut to -10bps. Likely to be pricing in some risk of a cut to zero and some of a cut to negative, which would mean 48% is an absolute upper bound for the chance of a rate cut below 0%. If my  maths is right, if you assume a 50% chance of a cut to zero, you get a c. 23% chance of a cut to -10bps, whereas if you assume it is 75% you get a 10% chance. So lots of potential options:\n23% based on historical chances of a rate cut over all time (probably an overestimate given a cut to negative is a \"bigger deal\" and there are probably excuses to see how things go)\nc. 6% just based on decisions since 2010 (probably an underestimate given there has been more easing than tightening since 2010 and signals from the MPC seem more open to negative rates than at any previous time)\nc. 10% a likely decent point estimate given data on frequency of previous easing and some adjustment for the options in front of the MPC not including negative rates\n10 - 23% a decent estimate range from market pricing So, feel like I need to be above 10%, especially as there are probably longer tails on economic outcomes than we have seen previously and the noises. 20% seems too high given I do think the MPC will want to be cautious on going to negative rates and I think they have options to both try other things first and to be cautious as they wait to see the outcomes of Covid and the new Brexit deal.

To set the scene, this comment from Andrew Bailey, Governor, Bank of England, at the press conference after the last MPC meeting. (Pg 5 of https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/monetary-policy-report/2020/november/mpr-press-conference-transcript-november-2020.pdf) Andrew Bailey: \"No, of course, I'll take the negative rate question. I think Ben may want to come in on the risk points. On negative rates, we haven't said anything more today in this report because we've set out the work we're doing. You know, we're very clear on that. You know, we set out in the August Monetary Policy Report our evaluation, particularly of the experience of those other central banks that have used negative rates, and how we thought that could read across. From that we concluded that it was sensible to regard negative rates as a tool that is in the box, as it were, but as I've said quite a few times it would be a cardinal sin for us to say we've got a tool in the box which we actually knew we didn't know how to use or didn't actually know with confidence that it couldn't be used in terms of its effectiveness, and that's why we've set off the work on the operational issues around the use of negative rates. That work is ongoing, particularly with banks and other relevant financial institutions, because, just to give you the obvious example, it would be a real sin if we said, 'Yes, let's implement a negative rate,' and then found that there were many IT systems in the transmission mechanism where people said, 'Well, if you put a negative rate into that system it will just blow up in terms of calculations.' I mean, that would be more than unfortunate. So, we've got to do that work. That work is ongoing. I'm not going to put a timeline on it because as you can probably take from what I've said that, sort of, devil's in the detail with that stuff. Committee is not divided on the importance of doing that work, it's actually very unanimous on the importance of doing that work, and, so, that's what we're doing. So, there's nothing further to report on that.\" Clearly, the Bank is considering the possibility of negative rates but is / was reluctant in November simply because the full implications of that policy were not understood, albeit the experience of other central banks has been looked into. Since that meeting, Covid-19 new cases and deaths have increased and stricter lockdowns / restrictions have been imposed. This will affect the outcome of GDP growth over Q4 - Q1/Q2, unemployment and the potential for the banks target rate of inflation of 2% to be missed by quite a large margin. While the UK has started the process of vaccinating against Covid-19, i) herd immunity will not be reached in a matter of 3-4 months, ii) it is unlikely the country can vaccinate 40m people in 2-3 months to attempt to enhance the possibility of herd immunity, and iii) there is an element of the population that does not want the vaccine for various reasons.  As also referenced in the minutes linked above, there is still a fairily large 'headroom', which is self-imposed and which can be amended if needs be, for the bank to continue with QE / asset purchases. Another factor the Bank mentions is that their assumption is that there will be a trade agreement between UK and EU. As of today, that's looking 50:50. Nonetheless, the UK economy will obviously experience a period of adjustment after the country leaves the EU. Even if there is a trade agreement, the extent of the adjustment is mostly based in guess work as it's not been experienced before.
