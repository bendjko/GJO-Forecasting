However, election fraud has been a huge problem for Russian citizens. Leaders of the opposition party such as Alexey Navalny have been jailed or even exiled, and citizens who have supported opposition have been disenfranchised. Electronic voting and the severely limited ability to watch video streaming of polling stations by the CEC (Central Election Commission) have made it obvious that voting may be skewed. Most polls have reported United Russia to win around 300 seats, maintaining their majority. Despite this, the United Russia Party has seen its lowest popularity rating in 15 years - reported around and below 30% - suggesting the opposition will win seats in many of the single mandate districts where many United Russia candidates have done no campaigning at all. The amount of seats won by United Russia will likely depend on the severity of election fraud as well as voter turnout, which has also been low, reported at just around 31%. https://www.4freerussia.org/russian-state-duma-election-campaign-analysis-the-final-countdown/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=russian-state-duma-election-campaign-analysis-the-final-countdown&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=russian-state-duma-election-campaign-analysis-the-final-countdown\nhttps://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/russia-votes-state-duma-elections-2021/"], [102408, "2021-09-19T00:35:28Z", [0.02, 0.88, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [58508, "2021-09-18T23:16:24Z", [0.01, 0.34, 0.65, 0.0], ""], [84880, "2021-09-18T21:37:13Z", [0.0, 0.17, 0.83, 0.0], "Just a technicality at this point...

The optics of cancelling elections are poor (costs are high) whereas you are not concerned about the result anyway (returns are low). \n5) at the same time, polling shows Putin's popularity at an all-time low. All in all: chance of cancellation and fewer than 226 seats seem improbable because of the controlled nature of the elections. Looking at past elections, the result can go over 300 or under. Putin's popularity drop gives some indication that it might be under, but the effect of such matters on elections in Russia are to be debated. As a result under 300 would mean a significant drop off from its current level of 336, chances seem lower that that result will be allowed.
