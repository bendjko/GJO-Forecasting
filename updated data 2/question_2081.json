For (1) Timing of Travel Mix:  Business travel appears with a gradual build over the next 12-months.  Currently, only 40% of companies have resumed domestic travel with only another 24% expected to resume domestic travel over the next three months [https://www.gbta.org/Portals/0/21st_Poll_Results_07-19-21.pdf?ver=2021-07-16-152603-997]. Importantly, resuming domestic travel and volume of domestic travel are two separate concepts.   As a result, business related travel in September and October is likely to remain subdued simply because domestic travel from corporates remains constrained.  At the same time, it is likely to slowly increase as the US reaches herd immunity.  Based on simple forecasting, domestic business travel demand is low and slowly increasing. Leisure travel is the other important dynamic.  This is harder to capture with data (so far).  After the summer travel season with pent up vacation demand, will this continue at these levels in the fall?  I honestly do not know.  However, how would I plan a vacation during this period?  Utilize vacation days for long weekends so travel will be solid from Friday through Monday.  What about Tuesday through Thursday thought? For (2) The Race (mRNA Vaccination Rates vs. Covid-19 Variants):  In the near-term the delta variant appears to be impacting well-known vacation locations, such as Florida.  However, as students go back to school and offices expect employees to return, there is a likelihood of increased cases associated with the delta variant.   I would hope that increased cases would spur those who have chosen to not get vaccinated to get vaccinated.  In my opinion, this risk will be largest before October 1st. So below are the two questions that I think really matter for this question:\n(1) When will the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) next screen fewer than 1.3 million travelers per day for three consecutive days from Tuesday to Thursday?  \n(2) Will a new Covid-19 variant that is worse than Delta emerge and get around the vaccination?   I think both are a low probability; however, there is an elevated chance before 1 October 2021 due to the delta variant, low business travel, and a reduction in leisure travel mid-week.\n"], [101355, "2021-07-27T13:08:33Z", [0.7, 0.2, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [101187, "2021-07-27T07:28:38Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [94872, "2021-07-27T02:31:09Z", [0.02, 0.02, 0.03, 0.03, 0.9], ""], [691, "2021-07-26T19:17:29Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [86554, "2021-07-26T19:12:25Z", [0.0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.04, 0.9], ""], [29680, "2021-07-26T17:29:26Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [6425, "2021-07-26T17:16:30Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [83135, "2021-07-26T17:13:18Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.31, 0.69], ""], [101187, "2021-07-26T11:31:07Z", [0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.96], ""], [101187, "2021-07-26T09:15:33Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.8], ""], [92079, "2021-07-26T03:36:24Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [92079, "2021-07-26T03:34:27Z", [0.0, 0.3, 0.7, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [70711, "2021-07-26T03:10:07Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "Vaccination + 4th wave : herd immunity...\nLikelihood of a variant that is unchecked by vaccines is low probability..."], [22689, "2021-07-25T16:39:27Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [85601, "2021-07-25T13:31:56Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0, 0.99], "It would take a large covid wave before final vaccinations have occured for this to happen at this point.
