Additionally, the current pandemic adds additional barriers to organizing and conducting large military exercises, making them less likely overall.\nOn the other hand, rising US-Chinese tensions and rising provocativeness of US presence/actions in the SCS may prompt China to use more naval exercises to send strong signals and assert more control in the region.

I think in this case that while @Awisdomofwombats has once again succeeded in offering some outstanding points, it appears to me that he or she might be basing a substantial proportion of his/her forecast on a (perhaps?) misreading of the question, which at first appearance would require *both* Russia & PRC to conduct joint ops *together*, but in reality requires only one or the other!

Seems like we might be due. BUT! As @LCBC2020 points out, none of those exercises were conducted later than September or earlier than April, which makes the likelihood of a winter exercise (at least with China & Russia together) seemingly pretty unlikely.  BUT! As @Fueled_by_Gummybears points out, this question ain't just about CH-RUS exercises - it's about ANY joint exercise, and the whole \"we don't do joint exercises in winter\" thing doesn't extend well when it comes to moving outside of the specific CH-RUS diad.

Realist balance-of-power considerations versus institutional and regional relationship-building considerations provide different potential outcomes, all of which would require an in-depth understanding of Chinese and Russian decision-making. In addition to the linked exercises, Russia and China have collaborated in multilateral (not bilateral) land exercises as recently as September 2020 (1) and conducted naval drills alongside Iran in 2019(2).  \nFactors related to the 'why' behind participation in previous and potential future exercises are important; Russian and Chinese courtship of Iranian energy reserves and desires to independently appear as benevolent players amongst Eurasian states are potential explanations of their 'joint' participation in the previous exercises and may therefore not be useful indicators of why Russia and China might participate in bilateral exercises.  Conversely, this *broadens* the reasons why Russia and China might be tempted to participate in multilateral activities in areas of mutual benefit, though areas of mutual benefit that also facilitate naval exercises in particular limits the list a lot.  Arctic cooperation seems unlikely because of unease on both sides about monopoly, though @fueled_by_gummybears point on non-military exercises raises the overall chances of this event significantly.  This is because Russia-China non-military Arctic cooperation is subtle, relatively non-threatening, and \u201cthreads the needle\u201d on several concerns I raise below.\nSome factors that may make joint naval exercises less likely are related to Russia-China competition over energy (China as a consumer, Russia as producer), competition for primacy in the Arctic, Russian concerns over Chinese theft of technology (3), and especially over the dynamics of China as a rising great+ power and Russia as a struggling middle+ power. These may provide incentives on either side (especially the Russian) not to desire an exercise.  \nChina may see value in demonstrating closer cooperation with Russia, given hardening relationships with India and other regional powers.  From a realist perspective, Russia is incentivized to allow China to be counter-balanced by India and other local powers.  From an economic perspective, Russia may indeed be incentivized to cooperate with China to increase energy exports to China.  However, this is again mitigated by a Russia that is most likely concerned that China has many sources of energy and material from numerous middle eastern and African nations due to investment by general Chinese businesses, state-owned enterprises, and CCP-sponsored BRI initiatives.  In this situation, a savvy Russia might want China to be counterbalanced to create a longer-term balance against China that is of more value than a short-term increase in Russian exports.\nEither China or Russia may see an opportunity to demonstrate concordance against a new US administration, which could be perceived as threatening by the United States without much concomitant gain for either Russia or China.  Threatening the US through this kind of action potentially supports a new US administration in forming domestic and/or international consensus' against Russia and/or China. It would have to be accompanied by some pretty important gains for Russia and China in return.  I could see an energy deal reaching this bar for Russia, but I also see it being at odds with China\u2019s traditional strategy of appearing non-threatening. (4)  This entire line of thought is undermined because minor naval exercises, especially including non-military ones, are not all that big a deal. \nNeither Russia nor China have recently shown a desire to cooperate as peers with other great or near-great powers.. I find COVID-19 comments by @TheBlindMouse and @caj05 to be appealing, but I don't see Covid moving the chances by more than a few percentage points because if other factors in favor of this happening become convincing, I don't see Covid being the thing that overrides those factors.    \nOverall, there are solid reasons for both the Russian and Chinese sides to either participate or not participate in a naval exercise in the near term.  From my ignorant perspective, the mitigating forces in either direction aren\u2019t clear.

This year Russia, China, and a few other nations conducted a land exercise in Southern Russia (Kavkaz), so this may fulfill the foreign joint exercise objectives for both nations. This is not to say that Chinese and Russian joint exercises are limited to one per year, but with COVID still very active in Russia it is likely to diminish the likelihood of other exercises this year. Russia expended considerable resources preventing COVID outbreaks for the recent Kavkaz, which is not surprising since it is their a part of their annual capstone exercise series.

However, 2019 saw two China-Russia engage in two primarily maritime exercises with one occurring in April and a second in late December. This second exercise was conducted with Iran in the Gulf of Oman and Indian Ocean and may provide some signal that it could reoccur this year as well. However, there are reasons to think that Russia and China (and Iran) will utilize the following four months as part of an information-gathering phase regarding US intentions. The recent US DOD shakeup and tense Presidential election make the US an arguably less predictable international actor until the beginning of the new presidential term. Compounding the issue is the possibility that Iran may attempt to strike back at the US in retaliation for the strike on Soleimani, and neither Russia nor China would likely want to be seen as supportive.

However, naval exercises must, almost certainly, involve one of three Russian formations: the Far-East/Pacific fleet in Vladivostok, the baltic fleet in Kaliningrad, or the Black Sea fleet in Sevastopol (ruling out the Russian Mediterranean Fleet in Syria due to the on-going war and the Russian North Sea Fleet due to the lack of surface vessels and extreme weather conditions in Murmansk). Two of these formations are in ports that are only semi-tenable from Nov to 1 Mar (Kaliningrad and Vladivostok) and the third in Sevastapol would require a Chinese fleet to transit to the Black Sea or the Black Sea Fleet to leave the Black Sea. Both of these propositions are very unlikely due to the distances involved, the requirement for Turkish acquiescence, and on-going disputes in Ukraine. Over the last decade, all but one of the ten joint Chinese-Russian exercises have involved the Chinese North or East Sea Fleets and the Russian Pacific Fleet.
