From what I can determine (English and French) The \"Hirak\" (the movement in the streets) is not  behind any member of the political class. They are angry, want immediate radical change, which poses the risk of destabilizing the Algerian polity. There is some stuff on You Tube TV5 MONDE Info etc. Azzedine Mihoubi who has developed considerable street cred with the \"Hirak\" stands a good chance of being elected by those who do decide to vote. He was until 1 April 2019 the Culture Minister and was part of the current regime operated by Le Pouvoir, which caused me to associate him with the FLN.  In fact, digging deeper, in French media it appears he dissociated himself with the FLN regime in April. On 20 July he surfaced (4 months later) as the head of the emergent Rassemblement Democratique National (National Democratic Rally). Details see Wikipedia in French. Mihoubi as Culture Minister was part of the apparat operated by Le Pouvoir, He he has held key leadership positions at state run TV and Radio entities, and was the bomo at the National Library. He is a poet. Maybe seen by some as an Algerian-style Vaclev Havel... He did attend the ENA, Algeria's FLN dominated national administration school, modeled after the French ENA. My sense is that he will need to get more traction with \"Hirak\" factions, and consolidate and mediate this polymorphous movement and co-exist or cohabit with Le Pouvoir. And when you consider that any Le Pouvoir that can produce a secret service leader like General Mohamed Medine, also known as  \"Toufik\" (a Markus Wolf type- apparently retired in 2015) has the capability to have someone operating as \"marionettiste\" with Mihoubi as the front man.  Now who, if anyone, might that be? Mihoubi's personal social media presence, and his support networks on Facebook, Twitter and elsewhere are very strong and sophisticated. Might there some Bannon and Lewandowski wannabeskis lurking in the Maghreb.... R. Zaretsky writing in November Foreign Affairs, cognitive bias toward Hirak, sez Hirak will make the Dec 12 election a failure, but a victory for democracy.  Perhaps. But it could also lead to the Balkanization or Somaliaization of Algeria, with risk of shrinking the size of the largest nation on Africa continent. Certainly the Pouvoir does not want that, risk nor do Algeria allies Russia and China. Nor do defense and security establishments in France, where the martinet Macron is facing a Hirak a la Francaise...   As Emil has noted in his comment below (not citing a source his prediction), former FLN golden boy Tebboune seems to have fallen out with Le Pouvoir. That puts Mihoubi as a likely non FLN winner.  Another issue figuring into the mix is regional powers Turkey and Saudi, and Iran, with cash and commodities... who migh they fronting points for?"], [57797, "2019-12-10T21:36:11Z", [0.38, 0.62, 0.0], "Extremizing a tad, 2%, after recent discussions.

The first question seems a definite yes: The Conseil constitutionnel has affirmed that the conditions necessary for an election are in place, first of which was that there be sufficient candidates in place for an election, and General Ahmed Ga\u00efd Salah, the army chief, has declared that he will ensure that there will be an election. The establishment has geared itself up for an election in order to remove the uncertainty that exists at present. Act of God aside, there will be an election. \u201cWe remain convinced that it is necessary to elect a new president to fill the void in the executive branch, and especially to move forward on more important issues,\u201d said FLN Executive Abou El Fadel Baadji (https://www.theafricareport.com/19608/algeria-divided-over-presidential-elections/).  The second part of the question deserves some context: Abdallah Djaballah's opposition party, the Front de la justice et du d\u00e9veloppement, will be boycotting the election, citing the adulterated nature of the contest, which seems set to hand power to a member of the FLN or military-approved candidate and hoping to \u201creturn sovereignty to the people\u201d (https://www.theafricareport.com/18995/algeria-abdallah-djaballah-military-likely-to-postpone-elections/). They are joined in their boycott by the Forces de l\u2019Alternative d\u00e9mocratique.  Ironically, the ruling party, the Front de lib\u00e9ration nationale, whose secretary general, Mohamed Djema\u00ef, was imprisoned, will not field an official presidential candidate. However, it will support Abdelmadjid Tebboune, a former Prime Minister, who is a member of its Comit\u00e9 central (https://www.algerie1.com/actualite/le-parti-fln-soutiendrait-abdelmadjid-tebboune-selon-son-charge-de-communication). To quote its communications chief, Ali Ramdani, \"Si on devait choisir un candidat, il n' y a pas de doute que ce sera Abdelmadjid Tebboune\" (\"If we must choose a candidate, it is without doubt that it will be Abdelmadjid Tebboune\"). So, even though Tebboune is not an official candidate, this qualifies him as a \"member of the National Liberation Front (FLN) party\".  Aside from the aforementioned Tebboune, four other candidates will be running, according to the Autorit\u00e9 nationale ind\u00e9pendante des \u00e9lections (ANIE): Ali Benflis of the Avant-garde des libert\u00e9s, who has twice ran for president and served as a Prime Minister under the former President, Abdelaziz Bouteflika; Abdelkader Bengrina, a former Algerian tourism minister, of the Al Binaa party, a group of moderate Islamists; Azzedine Mihoubi, a former culture minister, running for the Rassemblement national d\u00e9mocratique (RND), which has governed as part of the ruling coalition; and Abdelaziz Bela\u00efd of the Front El Moustakbal, a small party close to the FLN.  The second part of this question, then, can be narrowed to, \"Will Tebboune or another candidate win this election?\". Tebboune and Benfils are widely viewed as the frontrunners, but I cannot find any polling evidence, in English or in French. Indeed, there is no polling to indicate how large the Hirak movement is, which opposes the elections and rejects all five candidates as being regime candidates.  One presumes that the Hirak (Anger) movement is sizable, part of a global protest movement against the \"establishment\", and that there will be fairly high voter apathy come December 12.  A second assumption is that Tebboune is the front runner: FLN supporters will be motivated to turn up and they will have the biggest slice of the voting public by virtue of history, profile, and networks and tacit support from the military, though I think the military would find Benfils acceptable if he negotiated a division of power with the military that protected their interests. The other candidates would not have the resources, networks and clout to win the election. Bengrina has attempted to channel the rage of Hirak by portraying himself as its \"representative\" (https://www.dzairdaily.com/bengrina-representant-hirak-algerie-elections/), but I doubt that flies. A parallel is the first post-Mugabe election in ZImbabwe, which Mugabe's party, ZANU, won, having deposed him after 37 years in power. I am skeptical that the army and institutions are open enough to allow a candidate not Tebboune or Benfils, to win, and in terms of interests, Tebboune is closer to \"le pouvoir\" (those in power) as the French say. Consequently, I tilt toward Tebboune.

I would guess that support for the non FLN candidates would be a little stronger but ultimately acknowledge there is little clarity.

The regime is better prepared for an election now and has been said to have received lots of candidates and plus protests, although persistent, are not as high so likelihood of delay appears low.  A candidate not from FLN has won an election before (although he was still pro status quo regime anyway) so this outcome is not too unlikely. However, with crackdowns on protests, boycotts of the election and some opposition parties saying they won't run means that this outcome has only a 15% in my opinion. "], [80196, "2019-10-21T14:55:22Z", [0.65, 0.07, 0.28], "Lets examine first the reasons that could result in the election not being held:\n- Increase of mass protests. The protestors have decreased since the Bouteflika resignation, however, they keep taking the streets every week, and they show themselves committed with a real change, and against the 12 December elections. So, i assign a 20% chance of the election being cancelled due to the protests. This would be higher if in the next weeks we see an increase of violence, but for the moment the protestors have been pacific.\n-Logistic problems. The last elections were scheduled in july, but they were cancelled because no candidate was presented (although it is said that the real reason was the lack of logistic capability to organise the election). This time, however, the army chief Gaid Salah has been very clear about his intention to hold the election, and the Algerian Press Service has announced 137 candidate petitions so i think there is no more than a 5% chance.\n-Elite breakdown. The political elite in Algeria is not completely united. Although Gaid Salah is the visible face, there is some factions that are not very happy to hold the election. However, they know now is not the best moment to start a conflict between themselves, so i think there is a 3% chance for the internal power struggle to happen. Now, if nothing of the above happens, then there is a pretty high chance of the election being held. Of course, in this case a sustancial part of the electorate would not vote. Despite the government announcing free and fair elections, the people of Algeria does not trust the status quo, and neither they want to vote as long as the old bouteflika elites are still in power. This means that a peaceful boycott is very likely. The people who want change will not vote, therefore only the people who support the current regime will vote, giving the FLN a good result. \nI give 65% to the FLN receiving the most votes (even with a very low participation), and 7% otherwise. That being said, i think the current political scenario is pretty complex, so further updates in the next weeks is very likely to happen.

This suggests that conditional on elections an FLN candidate is much more likely to win than not. I'll say 80/20 conditional on elections occurring.  Protests have been happening for over 30 weeks, but the articles suggest the number of protestors has declined from 100,000+ to 10,000+ since President Abdulaziz Bouteflika resigned. This suggests that the election may have diminished protests. However, the election has already been rescheduled once, which maybe should increase my base rate for election not occurring.
