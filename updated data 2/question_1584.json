The conventional wisdom is that a presidential hopeful chooses his running mate before the general election race begins. Then again, conventional wisdom would also limit one to picking a man as his vice president and that is clearly not the situation we are in now. Despite this being such an unusual point in election history, where a nominee for president has publicly committed himself to choose and a woman and probably an African American one to fill the VP spot, I think many of the standard political considerations still hold true. And those assumptions are what I am going to use to establish my base rates. Let\u2019s talk geography.This is how the 14 post WWII Vice Presidents break down. I\u2019m using regional designations from the US Census Bureau to standardize things. [1][2] 6 out of 14 - South (43%)\n6 out of 14 - Midwest (43%)\n1 of of 14 - Northeast (7%)\n1 of of 14 - West (7%) As we can see it is \u2018almost certain\u2019 on the Sherman Kent scale (88%) that the Vice President will either be from the Midwest or the South. This makes sense electorally speaking. Both regions are home to key states like Michigan, Ohio, Florida and Texas. If you want to win the White House you have to have a good showing here. But it doesn\u2019t take long to notice that black, southern women are disproportionately underweighted in my prediction. That\u2019s because location isn\u2019t the only thing that matters when picking a VP - experience is a huge factor. Look at this break down of second-in-commands by previous experience [3]: 1 out of 14 - Cabinet Secretary (7%)\n2 out of 14 - Only House of Representatives (14%)\n2 out of 14 - Ambassador (14%)\n2 out of 14 - Mayor (14%)\n3 out of 14 - Legal (21%)\n3 out of 14 - Governor (21%)\n7 out of 14 - Senate (50%) Clearly Senate experience is a huge factor - doubly important when compared to the next closest. Perhaps even more so because the other categories - except House only - are skewed by crosstabs. That\u2019s why Senators Klobuchar (Michigan) and Baldwin (Wisconsin) score so highly compared to the rest of the field. They have Senate experience and come from statistically important states.  By contrast those with only limited government experience like Abrams and Demmings fall well behind the rest of the pack. Governor Whitman comes from an important state but being a governor is much less favored in vetting combined with the fact that she was only recently elected. The same goes for Governor Grisham in New Mexico who has some House experience but currently serves as head of a state which ranks near bottom in electoral prestige. Worthy of mention too, are Democratic stars Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren who, although serving in the Senate, represent states on the margins of the vice presidential scrum. States which are also solidly blue, minimize the benefit (vote-winning at least) of choosing either as a running mate. This is just an initial forecast and there is plenty of news flying around that could change the picture completely day-to-day.

My personal choice would be Bass, but I could also see why Mr. Biden would want Susan Rice (four of their eight years under Obama were spent with each other).

The gist of these reports is that no one really know who it is going to be. It appears that a lot of narratives about the selection and reasoning for certain candidates being elevated have been coming from the VP selection committee and prominent Biden donors. However, there is very little talk coming from the candidate himself. That point is extra critical because as one article noted, Biden is likely to make this pick himself and not rely to much on committee opinion. Additionally, the candidate himself appears unsatisfied with the list since most people on it, with the exception of Susan Rice, do not have a long history working with him. So the bottom line is: uncertainty is king. No one (looking at you Harris) is above a 50% chance of getting the spot.  The other big takeaways, that really hurt Warren's chances, is that Biden is concerned with people who might come into the White House with their own agenda and that his circle's (read, not HIS) opinion is that the best candidate \"does no harm\" by being well-vetted and not mark a dramatic departure from Biden's campaign and platform. Warren would be something of a departure and she definitely has her own agenda. Also, I held Warren highly for so long because of rumors that Biden reached out to her about being Veep in 2016. However, I don't see any of that interest coming from him this time around. I might to choose to drop her lower as time goes on. The people whose stock rises the most from this are Karen Bass and Susan Rice. Rice because of her long relationship with Biden and Bass because she has a reputation for loyalty with strong progressive credentials. I don't really consider Bottoms or Demings viable so AW is mostly about Bass and Rice at this point. That is I suspect why I still have AW below the crowd.

The US has never had a female president or VP, and Democrats (and the country at large) are intent on changing that, and breaking the proverbial glass ceiling. At this point, the campaign and betting markets have explicitly ruled out the possibility of a male VP pick, for this reason, I have priced that probability at 0%.  Joe Biden is a particularly interesting party nominee. He is a centrist Democrat, career politician and comes from a working class background. He famously claims that he was the first senator he met. Biden is also older for a nominee at 78 years old. It is widely suspected he will be a one term president if he wins in November. This has important implications for his vice-presidential pick. If Joe Biden wins in November, which is likely (70%), his VP will be the favorite running as a near incumbent. In short, Joe Biden\u2019s campaign\u2019s team has been tasked with choosing the new leader of the Democratic Party.  Recent events have highlighted the injustices that Black Americans in the United States experience, and again elevated the discussion of race relations to the front of the national conscious. Spurred by incidents of police brutality, the past two months have again brought to light the disparity between the lives of white and black Americans. Police brutality against black Americans is nothing new. However, since the 2012 shooting of Trayvon Martin, the US as a whole has changed its opinions of the black lives matter movement. Americans of all races are significantly more likely to support recent protests than they were five years ago. Sporting organizations have changed course on their approach to protest by players before games. The country is more ready and willing to examine the ways in which black Americans are systemically oppressed. Because of this, I believe it would be politically deft of Joe Biden to chose a black women as his VP pick - and betting markets agree. Joe Biden needs to think of the implications of his pick. He is the favorite in the polls, and has polling leads in swing states. He needs a safe play: an uncontroversial pick. Donald Trump will continue to mismanage the Coronavirus epidemic, and the election is only four months away. Joe Biden\u2019s dominant strategy would be to make uncontroversial moves, and to chose an experienced politician, who the public is widely familiar with. These are three criteria on which I believe the campaign (which has likely already made their decision) should consider, is the VP pick: a suitable Democratic Party leader for 2024 (\u201cprediential\u201d), a politically expedient choice for the current times and safe. The front runner of betting markets is current Kamala Harris, a California senator. However, she has one weakness, which is that she was a prosecutor as the AG of California. She is undoubtably presidential and would be a safe pick for the VP role with Biden. She also has the greatest brand recognition as a former candidate for the nomination, but hails from California, the opposite of a swing state. Betting markets price her odds at 40%. I think this is bearish. There is nothing wrong with Kamala Harris. She was a near front runner for the election about 9 months ago, and performed particularly well in the debates. Had her campaign not but horrifically mismanaged their budget, she would\u2019ve been one of final holdouts. Nationally, she has good favorability ratings. She\u2019s a great speaker and debater, and would be strong against Mike Pence in the VP debate this fall. I think the next most likely choice is Susan Rice. I personally believe she would be the best choice for the democrats. She was Obama\u2019s ambassador to the UN and National Security Advisor. She has strengths in foreign policy, is ideologically a centrist and is undoubtably uncontroversial. However, the blame of the Benghazi attack in 2012 has been somewhat cast upon her, and she has never held elected office. There are more unknowns with Rice than with Harris, and she has less brand recognition. I think betting markets are correct that she has about a 28% chance of winning. Betting markets think Elizabeth Warren is another possible choice. I fundamentally disagree with this. I think Elizabeth Warren is an unlikely (though not impossible) choice. She is a Penn and Harvard professor turned MA senator. She\u2019s a brilliant orator and was nearly solely responsible for knocking Michael Bloomberg out of the Democratic race by eviscerating him in two debates. Like Harris, she would likely outperform Pence at the VP debate this fall. However, she is ideologically concerning as a Biden pick. A social democrat at heart, Warren has highly liberal aspirations that are not particularly popular nationally, but more importantly are polarizing - the opposite of what Biden\u2019s campaign needs. For what it\u2019s worth, she also has a minor racial controversy in her past. She also only endorsed Joe Biden after Bernie Sanders. Warren fans believe that she would be a unifying choice for the party. Donald Trump is the ultimate unifying force for Democrats- Biden has other areas he should focus on. I think she is outmatched on many important metrics by Harris and Rice, and despite being the most politically experienced, is an unlikely choice.  Keisha Lance Bottoms, the mayor of Atlanta is another name that has been mentioned in the past two months. She has never held national (or state level) office. Atlanta hasn\u2019t done a great job handling the coronavirus pandemic. I think this would be an unwise choice. She has been in the news a lot the past two months which is good for name recognition, as she has dealt with Atlanta protests and the coronavirus pandemic, with mixed results. However, this would be a surprising choice given how important the VP pick will be in 2024 as a Democratic Party leader. Stacy Abrams is another possible choice. She is a brilliant Yale Law choice who nearly won the Georgia governorship in 2018. She has never held national or state-leave office. She is a rising Democratic star, but choosing someone young and politically inexperienced to become the de-facto leader of the Democratic Party in 2024 seems unwise. I do not think she will be the VP choice as in recent weeks she\u2019s declined to say if she is still in the running for the role. I price her likelihood at 1%. Tammy Duckworth is another possible choice. She is a senator from Illinois. She is a veteran and a Purple Heart recipient. I think her recent bump in betting markets is due to being in a clash with Tucker Carlson two weeks ago.  She would potentially be good for appealing to veterans. I think the bettings markets view of 12% is bullish, and 9% or 75% of that value is more in line. I do not believe Gretchen Whitmer has a chance at being chosen as VP. The same goes for Klobutchar. Both are outmatched on too many metrics by the above candidates. PredictIt lists the current odds for the candidates as follows, which provides a good base rate.\nHarris 38%\nRice 27%\nDuckworth 12%\nWarren 8%\nDemings 9% I think that the markets are undervaluing Harris and Rice, which as mentioned I see as the only two sensible choices. I think Joe Biden, a career politician with a deeply experienced team will not chose Bottoms or Abrams, though I think Abrams is more likely. Using a simple model I wrote, I think the market has underweighted Harris and Rice\u2019s odds by about 25%, but has the relative likelihood correct.  Finally, sometimes crazy things happen in politics. In 2008, John McCain, the definition of a career politician, who was running against a young, inexperienced Democrat selected Sarah Palin. The move was shocking and resulted in his downfall. The memory of an inexperienced VP pick remains fresh in the minds of the political establishments."], [93518, "2020-07-20T03:36:35Z", [0.01, 0.1, 0.4, 0.0, 0.02, 0.01, 0.46, 0.0], "\"Another woman\" covers Rice, Demings, Bottoms, Abrams, Baldwin, Bass, Raimondo, and Grisham (plus any I'm forgetting)."], [86785, "2020-07-20T01:37:36Z", [0.02, 0.05, 0.32, 0.0, 0.11, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0], ""], [72292, "2020-07-20T01:02:22Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.32, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.68, 0.0], ""], [87440, "2020-07-20T00:13:05Z", [0.1, 0.1, 0.25, 0.04, 0.07, 0.02, 0.42, 0.0], ""], [94322, "2020-07-19T22:18:22Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [40848, "2020-07-19T20:13:35Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.48, 0.0, 0.03, 0.0, 0.39, 0.0], ""], [63963, "2020-07-19T16:56:56Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0], ""], [50981, "2020-07-19T15:02:10Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.6, 0.4], "I think he would like to pick Susan Rice.

Reasoning: TLDR changes in reporting on who is on the shorter list and response to the Floyd protests (https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2020/06/14/biden-running-mate-search-black-women-elizabeth-warren).  This forum has responded quite strongly to the Floyd protests. I now see the crowd forecast with Harris at 57%, Another Woman at 31% and Warren, Amy, and Whitmer dropped to zero. Comparing with Predicit (https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/5883/Who-will-win-the-2020-Democratic-vice-presidential-nomination) suggests that these dramatic shifts are an overreaction, and I think driven by the news cycle. I will comment on the \"overrated\" candidates in a second but for now, I am going to the \"underrated\" candidates: Klobuchar and Duckworth. While Amy has seen quite a fall, I don't think 0 is appropriate, she is still one of the few candidates who match Biden's fundamentals and even James Clayburn, Biden confidant, and congressional BC member, wouldn't rule her out (https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2020/06/14/biden-running-mate-search-black-women-elizabeth-warren). Duckworth also remains strong on the fundamentals. Still, I have to acknowledge that the changing conversation will likely change Bidens thinking: hence the dramatic fall. (Also cause I haven't updated in a while).  Warren is being criminally underrated. I have her in the same range as always because I still see no reason why her stock should fall. Particularly given her favorability amongst young African Americans compared to other candidates (https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/article243566952.html). \nNow to the overrated candidates. My theory in this question is that most news articles speculating who the VP is to be are often more about the reporter's opinion than the opinions of people advising Biden, let alone Biden himself. Often people in the extended circle of Biden donors gossip and formulate their own opinions (donors often play at being powerful and smart) which then get carried by the news. Except those opinions are themselves driven by how they see the campaign and the news cycle. To reiterate: they do not actually possess information about how Biden views the VP pick.  As a result, I think that Demmings and Bottoms are being very overrated right now. They have had an outsized presence in the media and that has led to speculation. But they are very far off the mark when it comes to the kind of candidate Biden wants: a national profile with DC experience. Hence why I have \"Another woman\" 15 points below the crowd.

While not every candidate has a confirmed interview (Harris and Warren notably don't), it means that 2nd tier candidates who do not have confirmed interviews, lose a lot of prospects. Notably, Whitmer said last week she has not had a formal VP interview yet and given that I only hear people outside the campaign talking about her I'm comfortable dropping her to 0. I'd do 0.5% if this program would let me. However, Duckworth, Hassan, and Demmings who both have interviews on the record see their stock increase.  3) Biden reiterated that he wants someone who is simpatico on policy but \"brings something different.\" This quote confirms the theory behind why he would want someone like Harris or Warren. Their stock sees a slight increase. 4) Prominent democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg leaked his presentation to the Biden campaign where he said the data support the notion that a Warren VP makes the most sense strategically (https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/500008-the-hills-campaign-report-buzz-builds-around-warren-for-vp?utm_source=thehill&utm_medium=widgets&utm_campaign=es_recommended_content).

Fun facts: Duckworth's entire political career she has been pushed along by Dick Durbin, the senior Senator from Illinois who recruited her for her first run at the congress. When that race didn't go well Obama got her a job in the VA until the next cycle in 2012. In 2016 her Senate race was one of the only ones to get the Biden-Obama endorsement and personal appearance. Part of all of this is that she has Obama's old senate seat.  In other words, Duckworth is one of the few candidates who has a history of being in the Obama-Biden orbit. She particularly contrasts with Klobuchar who does not have as much of personal history, at least not one that I have been able to find, as a moderate that more fits Joe Biden's politics. Illinois is also the mid-west but I don't think the Biden campaign cares about that logic. Given the ambiguity of who Biden has chemistry with, I think Duckworth is a strong 4th place.  My priors on Warren put her between 20-25 and on Harris put her between 40-55 so I'm comfortable dropping both of them. If Duckworth appears at an event with Biden, which many of the other candidates have, I will probably jump her to 6% to the expense of Amy and Another.

Of course, at this point, I would not expect him to have made up his mind but it suggests to me that the thought may be very possible and that meshes with reports of how his staff has responded to Stacy Abrams aggressively campaigning for the post.  The POLITICO piece does not really affect my forecast because it does not suggest anything about how Biden is thinking about the pick. Also, the headline is a little contrived.

Reasoning: Joe Biden's committee started meeting this month so the conversation has recently begun in earnest. Reporting from POLITICO (https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/10/kamala-harris-early-biden-vice-president-favorite-248615) gives the following data points: 1) Harris the \"frontrunner\" of most aides, donors, and surrogates according to donors with 24 people from this group. Additionally, James Clayburn is discussing Biden's pick in terms that appear to be advocating for Harris which really diminishes Abrams's chances since East-Coast and Southern surrogates are the people who need to be advocating for her if she is going to get chosen. Given precious knocks on Abrams, her lack of conformity with the profile of the nominee people are looking at, I am comfortable dropping her odds to 0%. Most interviews referred to how she looks \"on paper.\" This echoes my take on Harris, that she is the candidate that resembles what the campaign looks for however, chemistry with Biden is the obvious wild card. It's mostly just confirmation that Biden's team reads the data as I read it. It does not mean she is the \"obvious pick\" rather that purely looking at her profile and record she is the best pick.  2) Jill Biden is looking for ways to signal she is comfortable with Harris which is a shift after her dislike for Harris after the debate when Harris called out Biden's record on race. Jill's previous discomfort with Harris was a past knock against her. This also diminishes Amy's chances since Jill was reported to be peddling her briefly. 3) This isn't new data but is an adjustment on my priors: Harris and Beau Biden were friends. It indicates that Joe might be attached to her personally and signals they may have the running mate \"chemistry\" that Biden is looking for. 4) Warren is being seriously considered and there is a contingent of aides peddling her candidacy. She is being pitched as the \"governing\" pick. This echoes the previous reporting that simplified the decision amongst Biden's camp as a decision between uniting the party and a person of color.  5) No other candidates were mentioned. This \"lack of reporting\" diminishes the prospects most severely for candidates that do not have a relationship with Biden, since his opinion is one thing that is hard to discern and not revealed here. Whitmer, Abrams, and \"another woman\" take the biggest hit but the fact that Amy is not getting talked about is also bad news for her."], [20072, "2020-05-11T17:27:26Z", [0.07, 0.14, 0.12, 0.06, 0.08, 0.15, 0.37, 0.01], ""], [88186, "2020-05-11T15:06:08Z", [0.7, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.1], ""], [45594, "2020-05-11T13:10:51Z", [0.1, 0.1, 0.05, 0.2, 0.25, 0.05, 0.05, 0.2], ""], [88452, "2020-05-11T12:53:13Z", [0.03, 0.03, 0.12, 0.08, 0.06, 0.23, 0.1, 0.35], "Probably it is Bernie Sanders in a strategic move to ensure the Democratic voters' turnout among Bernie Sanders' supporters."], [86078, "2020-05-11T11:08:46Z", [0.09, 0.01, 0.3, 0.36, 0.09, 0.07, 0.08, 0.0], ""], [67232, "2020-05-11T06:58:14Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.25, 0.0], ""], [3599, "2020-05-11T05:30:40Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [3599, "2020-05-11T00:29:31Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.8, 0.1, 0.05, 0.0, 0.03, 0.02], ""], [57778, "2020-05-10T23:50:44Z", [0.07, 0.0, 0.22, 0.28, 0.18, 0.1, 0.14, 0.01], ""], [88420, "2020-05-10T23:36:54Z", [0.05, 0.15, 0.15, 0.2, 0.05, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1], "Biden doesn't like Warren, and he will be motivated to find someone who will consolidate and bolster his support, and he will choose someone he *likes*.

I am adjusting my priors here to move #5 to #2 in order of importance after reading some of Biden's remarks and understanding that he is unlikely to run for re-election. This change causes me to drop Stacy Abrams's chances and raise Klobuchar's as Klobuchar is without a doubt the most moderate and \"conventional\" VP pick and has the most Senate experience. Additionally, I think a focus on governing makes more outside candidates such as New Mexico's Governor, who a Biden confidant is allegedly pushing according to the article, and Duckworth more appealing. More reason to raise \"another woman.\" In other news Biden's wife doesn't like Harris and likes Klobuchar.

Many Biden allies and members of the Black Caucus are pushing for Stacy Abrams, Keisha Lance Bottoms, or Val Demmings. However, all these female African American lawmakers lack experience, name recognition, and national campaign experience which are all things that Kamala Harris has. Campaign experience was a big reason Barrak Obama chose Biden, and I suspect Biden will follow the same logic. Additionally, Kamal Harris has some lefty appeal, she did co-sponsor Medicare for all back in the day, even if some of her old stances as a prosecutor, like criminalizing Truancy, have made her enemies on the left. However I don't think Biden will weigh these as campaign flaws as he is more of an old fashioned politician who has worse stances on criminal justice. I think Kamal is a favorite, but not quite against the field because there is a lot of ambiguity and this will come down to Biden's preferences. Also, Kamal has come out strong in defense of Biden following Tara Reade. 2) Warren (20%) and Klobuchar (10%). Notable my top 3 picks all ran for president. Klobuchar is a strong 10% because she aligns with Biden ideologically and hailing from the midwest old fashioned campaigners would try to pick someone with a regional advantage. However, she isn't more than a 1/10 because the Biden camp seems to be mostly debating between a person of color or a progressive, there is less talk in trying to get a solid moderate midwesterner. Warren is in a camp of her own. She is the pick if the campaign really wants to energize the base and pick someone with credibility on bailouts and Coronavirus. Biden has historically thought about campaigning with her so he is definitely thinking about it now. However she is hurt by hailing from a state with a red governor, moving farther the left in the presidential, and she has avoided comment on Tara Reade. 3) Another woman (8%). This category should arguably have more weight because there are a lot of talented women in this group. The biggest being Cortez-Masto who by herself I would put at 5. But also  Keisha Lance Bottoms, Val Demmings, Tammy Baldwin, and Michelle Lujan Grisham. I should note that any woman who has not run for president I automatically give an under 10% chance. This forecast uses that factor very seriously.  4) Abrams (3%), Whitmer (3%), and Duckworth (5%). These are all strong candidates and they all do different things. Duckworth is moderate and just an all-around strong candidate. I weigh senators higher because they are experienced and are more likely to already have a report with Biden. Whitmer is midwestern and maybe a strong \"Coronavirus\" response candidate. Abrams is the favorite of a lot of Black Caucus members, but she is opposed by Lance Bottoms, one of Biden's strongest surrogates, and she is the least experienced of all options. 5) Someone else not a woman. This is exclusively under the probability that Biden's campaign gets derailed either from health-related reasons or an explosion of the Tara Reade scandal. In which case it is likely that his VP pick, who is likely to be a woman, would unite the party and pick a man as her running mate.

Assuming Joe Biden is the candidate (-95%) he has said that he would pick a woman. I am not 100% certain it will be a woman; if Biden doesn't like them personally or they have significant idealogical differences, he may find that there are no suitable female candidates. There has been 1 female VP candidate before, in 2008, worth bearing in mind.  I also think its worth bearing in mind I don't think he loses too much by going back on this, very few people will be aware of it and its not an attack line in states they need to win that I think has very much weight. VP candidates themselves don't have much evidence of having an impact, fwiw, so I doubt there is much of a story about him saying he will pick a woman then going back on what he said. I think its around 10-15% it isn't a woman, which would drop if Bernie were to become the candidate, rise if another person was to become the candidate. 2. Since 1988, only 1 time out of 16 has a Presidential candidate picked someone who ran in the primary against them as a VP candidate, in 2004. (John Edwards was his name, give him a google). This lowers the chances off the three who ran against him and are named here imo, for a bunch of reasons you don't want to select someone who has campaigned against you.  3. I do think Harris has a slightly better chance than Klobuchar or Warren, but I also think Abrams has an advantage given she didnt run against Biden, the same with some others named. I also just think it might be a woman not on the list, if you are popping off 6 names with no certainty then another name may well be just as likely.

I'm basing that on the fact that there are hundreds, if not over a thousand, female politicians who may meet the criteria for a VP. This is especially poignant when adds to the list prominent republican women, such as Jenean Hampton of Kentucky, who would represent a unity ticket with the explicit goal of beating the incumbent. If Hampton didn't have close ties to the Tea Party, I'd say either her or someone in a similar position were the most likely candidate. Of those who are commonly spoken about, I give Tammy Duckworth the highest odds at 20%. She would check a lot of boxes for a lot constituencies the Biden campaign likely wants to placate. She is from a Midwestern state with a Democratic governor who would appoint a democrat to her seat should she become the VP.  She's generally progressive but not to a point where she would become a political liability any more so than Joe Biden himself already is. Stacey Abrams comes in at 16% because she would similarly check a lot of boxes, particularly with the black voters who have propelled Biden to the nomination. The only reason her and Duckworth don't have equal odds is her general lack of experience in elected office. My guess is that the Biden campaign, regardless of who the pick, is assuming that the VP has higher probability of actually becoming president due to Biden's age when entering office. As a result, they are in all likelihood prioritizing government experience over many other factors. Which leads to Gretchen Whitmer at 15%. Whitmer would be a solid pick because of her executive experience however, the fact that she is white and that there was a large amount of dialogue about the primary eventually narrowing down to an effectively all white field works against her potential as a VP pick. On top of that, Michigan has faded from blue to purple over the last election cycles and with the difficult policy decisions related COVID-19 she will have to make, it's likely that Whitmer's favorability will begin to decline in the coming months. Next up we have Biden's former primary opponents. I find it unlikely he will pick a VP from the list of other presidential candidates during the 2020 cycle. Amy Klobochar has better odds than Harris or Warren because she at least did not openly attack Biden in ways that received lots of coverage. She was also not at any point a front runner in the campaign. On top of that, Warren and Harris would both highlight the inconsistent speech patterns of Biden and the last thing the Biden campaign wants is to make their candidate look weak.

In assigning the probability of each Candidate I will adopt a filter system of multiple layers with Candidates compared against each layer and removed if necessary. The layers are - I Age, II Politics, III Experience, IV Replaceable & Eligibility, V Do no Harm I Age - This layer relates to Criteria 2, which I will assume means the VP must be at least 10 years younger than Biden who is 77 years old. Of the 6 Candidates, only Elizabeth Warren fails to meet this Criteria at age 70 years old, Elizabeth Warren = 0% II Politics -This layer deals with Criteria 3, meaning that the VP must share his Political Ideology. Biden is a Moderate Democrat- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Democrats\nAside from Elizabeth Warren (Progressive), all the 5 Candidates appear to be of the same Political Ideology (more or less) as Biden. III Experience -This relates to a Candidate's length of Experience of Governing in National Office (e.g. US Congress, State Governor, Executive Branch etc) and addresses Criteria 4. In reviewing the most recent 16 Vice Presidential Nominations from 1976 - 2016 I found the length of Experience VP's had of Governing in National Office upon being nominated were -\n1 - 6 Years = 3/16 = 19% (Edwards 2004, Ferraro 1984, Palin 2008)\n7 - 12 Years = 5/16 = 31% (Kaine 2016, Lieberman 2000, Mondale 1976, Bush 1980, Quayle 1988)\nx>=13 Years = 8/16 = 50% (Pence 2016, Ryan 2012, Cheney 2000, Kemp 1996, Bentsen 1988, Biden 2008, Gore 1992, Dole 1976) This agrees with my research of the Vice Presidency in how it has grown in recent decades into a Governing Partnership with the President with a VP with lots of Experience in National Office highly desirable.\nGiven Stacey Abrams has no Experience in National Office, I believe she has no chance of being selected VP, Stacey Abrams = 0%.\u00a0All the previous 16 VP candidates had at least some National Office Experience with Sarah Palin the shortest at 1 year as Alaskan Governor. Using the code A = 19% = 1 - 6 Years, B = 31% = 7 - 12 Years, C = 50% = x>=13 Years, I will code the Candidates based on their Experience of National Office -\u00a0\n(13 Years) Klobuchar = C = 50% = 41%\n(3 Years) Harris = A = 19% = 16%\n(11 Years) Duckworth = B = 31% = 27%\n(1 Year) Whitmer = A = 19% = 16% I debated whether being a\u00a0State Attorney General like Kamala Harris is Governing Experience but I decided against it.\u00a0Of the 16 VP nominees, 2 have been a State Attorney General (Mondale / Lieberman) but both already had strong experience in the Senate (12 / 11 Years) upon being selected. IV Replaceable & Eligibility, Replaceable refers to if that Person is chosen as Vice President. How will the Vacancy they create be filled ?\nTo the best of my Research, neither Klobuchar, Harris, Duckworth or Whitmer present any significant challenges like Warren (Republican Governor fills her Senate Seat) if they create a Vacancy.\u00a0\nTo be eligible for the Vice Presidency, must be Natural Born US Citizen, Minimum 35 Years Old and Lived in the USA for the Last 14 Years. An issue for Duckworth (Like Ted Cruz in 2016) is she was born outside the USA (Thailand) with one of her parents an US Citizen. The Supreme Court has yet to rule if Natural Born means being born in the USA or not - https://www.politifact.com/article/2015/mar/26/ted-cruz-born-canada-eligible-run-president-update/ V Do No Harm - An consensus of VP's is they shouldn't be perceived to hurt a Presidential chances (For Example Palin 2008, Ferraro 1984, Eagleton 1972). \nHow Klobuchar, Harris, Duckworth and Whitmer can Harm Biden's Presidential Chances \n= Klobuchar - Has allegations of Staff Mistreatment.\n= Harris - During her Presidential Campaign she faced many criticisms of her previous prosecutions as San Francisco District Attorney & California Attorney General.\n= Duckworth - If we remember Trump with the Birther Conspiracy Theory for Obama, I can very easily see something even worse occurring given the uncertainty of Duckworth's eligibility for the Vice Presidency - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_citizenship_conspiracy_theories\n= Whitmer - Has very little experience in National Office, only became Governor of Michigan 1/1/2019. In reviewing the IV Replaceable & Eligibility and V Do No Harm, I believe it only affects the chances of Duckworth -Duckworth = 27% -> 14% (The risk of having a VP ruled ineligible by the Supreme Court is a huge given it fundamentally questions Biden's decision making and competence).\nKlobuchar = 41% -> 48%, Harris = 16% -> 19%, Duckworth = 27% -> 14%, Whitmer = 16% -> 19%. Allowing for For Another Woman = 10% (Consistent Media Reports say it is between Harris and Klobuchar)\nKlobuchar = 48% * 0.9 = 43%\nHarris = 19% * 0.9 = 17%\nDuckworth = 14% \u00a0* 0.9 =13%\nWhitmer = 19% * 0.9 = 17%\nStacey Abrams = 0%\nElizabeth Warren = 0%\nAnother Woman = 10%\nNot a Woman = 0% These percentages correspond to how I personally feel about each Candidate's chances.\u00a0"], [45594, "2020-04-10T09:34:29Z", [0.1, 0.1, 0.05, 0.2, 0.25, 0.05, 0.05, 0.2], ""], [81666, "2020-04-10T09:16:49Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.4, 0.4, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.0], "He indicate he would select a woman"], [87134, "2020-04-10T09:15:15Z", [0.1, 0.02, 0.4, 0.25, 0.1, 0.05, 0.05, 0.03], "First, politicians tend to keep their promises about 75% (https://www.vox.com/2015/11/27/9801800/politicians-keep-campaign-promises) of the time and that is across all the exigencies of their political life. Biden promised to select a woman. He has full control over this decision and it is hard to see events unfold that would render that a bad choice. So I think there is less than 5% chance he selects a man. Second, over the last 40 years, over 80% of VP picks of a major party are politicians with national standing (VP, Senator, cabinet member) and politicians are aware that having national experience is important to running (Obama once doubted whether Palin had enough time to become a national Candidate because it took him \"4 months\" to learn how to do it). This causes me to downgrade Stacey Abrams significantly. Third, there are two voting blocks I think Biden needs: 1) African Americans (which Kamala Harris would help); 2) Bernie voters (which Warren would help).

And of the 30% of the time the age difference is less than that, 90% of those scenarios the candidates were young (<56 years old). So I greatly discount Warren.

Biden promised to select a woman. He has full control over this decision and it is hard to see events unfold that would render that a bad choice. So I think there is less than 5% chance he selects a man. Second, over the last 40 years, over 80% of VP picks of a major party are politicians with national standing (VP, Senator, cabinet member) and politicians are aware that having national experience is important to running (Obama once doubted whether Palin had enough time to become a national Candidate because it took him \"4 months\" to learn how to do it).  This causes me to downgrade Stacey Abrams significantly. Third, there are two voting blocks I think Biden needs: 1) African Americans (which Kamala Harris would help); 2) Bernie voters (which Warren would help).

Biden owes his rapid change of fortune against Sanders to the black voters, as demonstrated by the endorsement of Clyburn and their overwhelming support in South Carolina.  I give 75% chance that the VP choice is an African-American woman. Warren, being white and on the left wing part of the Democratic party, has very low chance. Whitmer (Michigan) and Klobuchar (Minnesota) are both white and from the Midwest.  Choosing them will base on their ability to win the electoral votes in their state.  Minnesota has 10 votes and it is leaning Dem.  Michigan is a tossup and it has 16 votes.  On this account, Whitmer has better odds than Klobuchar.  However, Klobuchar has generated lots of exposure running for the presidential nomination.  I give them equal odds. Duckworth is Thai-American and a disabled veteran from Illinois.  Illinois is solidly Democratic.  She also has a low profile.  I think she is unlikely to be chosen. This leaves Harris and Abrams, both African Americans, and an yet unknown African American woman. Abrams has a lesser resume than Harris although she did very well in her running for the Georgia governor, losing by 50,000 votes. In her speech ending her campaign, she announced the creation of Fair Fight Action, a voting rights nonprofit organization that sued the Secretary of State and state election board in federal court for voter suppression. The lawsuit was still ongoing [1].  While she has the potential to deliver Georgia to the Dem, her ongoing lawsuit might be a distraction for the presidential campaign.   Harris ran for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.  She has an impressive resume, being the AG and Senator from California.  She is very articulate.  Her disadvantage is that California is solidly Dem.  However, I give Harris higher odds than Abrams. \n\n[1]  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stacey_Abrams#2018_gubernatorial_campaign"], [58668, "2020-04-06T02:52:55Z", [0.2, 0.1, 0.15, 0.1, 0.2, 0.0, 0.25, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2020-04-06T00:13:28Z", [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.35, 0.05, 0.05, 0.25, 0.0], ""], [79464, "2020-04-05T23:45:40Z", [0.17, 0.15, 0.12, 0.13, 0.16, 0.16, 0.11, 0.0], ""], [16109, "2020-04-05T23:45:39Z", [0.05, 0.0, 0.15, 0.1, 0.05, 0.15, 0.5, 0.0], ""], [7053, "2020-04-05T23:42:43Z", [0.3, 0.15, 0.2, 0.0, 0.05, 0.29, 0.0, 0.01], ""], [22745, "2020-04-05T23:25:24Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.4, 0.6, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [32258, "2020-04-05T23:12:42Z", [0.1, 0.0, 0.9, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "Clyburn's choice and other reasons; smart black woman, tough, good debater, Senate seat not up in 2020.

Kamala Harris broadens Biden's ticket demographically in terms of ethnicity and race.  She is a moderate but more liberal than Biden so potentially widens Biden's appeal to progressives. She also doesn't hurt the Democratic senate percentage, she is from CA where democratic governor Newsom will name her replacement. Doesn't hurt Biden's ticket. Amy Klobuchar is another great pick...a moderate, however I feel that she doubles down on Biden's midwest and working class appeal. She is a bit more progressive but doesn't significantly differ from Biden's ideology so doesn't offer much in widening Biden's ideologic appeal. She also lacks the ability to broaden Biden's appeal with minorities.   Elizabeth Warren is a progressive favorite however I feel that she would be a detractor to a Biden ticket and turn off many moderates so this would hurt the ticket. She may appeal to the party elite however this group is already a part of the Biden coalition. She is from MA where her replacement would be chosen in a special election in 2021 which might possibly result in losing a senate seat. She doesn't broaden Biden's appeal to minorities so I feel that she takes more away from the ticket than she brings to the ticket. Stacy Abrams....might broaden Biden's appeal ideologically and with minorities however she lacks experience in bigger government and I believe her outspokenness during the GA gubernatorial race was polarizing and exactly the divisive politics that is destroying this country. She has not been humble about her aspirations for VP or president which I also think will turn off people.  Of the unnamed individuals, I think Tammy Duckworth is another great pick. Broadens Biden coalition with minorities. She is a military veteran and amputee ( a bad ass helicopter pilot) which may appeal to a lot of republican leaning individuals. She is also on the Senate foreign affairs committee which can be as asset. Her replacement in congress would be via special election in 2021.  She was born in Thailand so there may be questions about qualification for president since she is foreign born."], [8826, "2020-04-05T18:18:43Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.0, 0.5, 0.05, 0.0, 0.3, 0.05], ""], [86985, "2020-04-05T18:01:59Z", [0.15, 0.05, 0.15, 0.15, 0.05, 0.0, 0.35, 0.1], ""], [172, "2020-04-05T17:26:08Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.35, 0.65, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [30976, "2020-04-05T17:22:28Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [11788, "2020-04-05T17:19:32Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.4, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [3110, "2020-04-05T17:13:43Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.6, 0.2, 0.16, 0.02, 0.02, 0.0], ""], [835, "2020-04-05T17:10:42Z", [0.05, 0.0, 0.77, 0.18, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [5974, "2020-04-05T17:09:02Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0], ""], [85882, "2020-04-05T16:50:07Z", [0.07, 0.06, 0.35, 0.1, 0.4, 0.02, 0.0, 0.0], "First metric I am using is baseline on Twitter followers, the VP needs to be a good well known name, and given Bidens age a viable presidential candidate, Warren fits the second part Harris the first.\nI can't see politically how it won't be a female vp Can anyone point me in right direction for any polling on this"], [86402, "2020-04-05T16:29:56Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0, 0.8, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [37548, "2020-04-05T16:00:31Z", [0.4, 0.1, 0.2, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05], ""], [86162, "2020-04-05T15:19:27Z", [0.25, 0.01, 0.33, 0.1, 0.05, 0.01, 0.15, 0.1], ""], [84099, "2020-04-05T13:03:36Z", [0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [75722, "2020-04-05T10:18:28Z", [0.15, 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [45594, "2020-04-05T08:22:19Z", [0.1, 0.1, 0.05, 0.2, 0.25, 0.05, 0.05, 0.2], ""], [79165, "2020-04-05T05:09:26Z", [0.14, 0.11, 0.26, 0.16, 0.02, 0.25, 0.06, 0.0], "Biden will take into account the democratic senate which is why I think Whitmer would be preferred to Klobuchar."], [85774, "2020-04-05T02:02:11Z", [0.01, 0.0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.0, 0.03, 0.5, 0.4], ""], [86358, "2020-04-04T20:40:38Z", [0.1, 0.02, 0.3, 0.2, 0.04, 0.13, 0.15, 0.06], ""], [11430, "2020-04-04T18:30:16Z", [0.1, 0.05, 0.15, 0.25, 0.0, 0.05, 0.25, 0.15], ""], [81518, "2020-04-04T16:15:57Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.3, 0.15, 0.1, 0.25, 0.08, 0.02], ""], [29896, "2020-04-04T15:34:12Z", [0.15, 0.08, 0.1, 0.36, 0.1, 0.2, 0.01, 0.0], ""], [691, "2020-04-04T15:14:24Z", [0.02, 0.21, 0.18, 0.32, 0.05, 0.2, 0.02, 0.0], "Having beaten out the Crazy Old Man, the Silly Old Man will be running against an Abominable Old Man and a religious fanatic.

Abrams is very good, but only slightly more qualified than, say, Mayor Pete or Governor Palin.   Not to put too fine a point on it, Biden doesn't need to do anything much to attract the black vote, but I sure hope he finds a Cabinet spot or something for Abrams if he wins. Duckworth is smart, articulate and funny, and gave up the chance for bone spurs during a combat operation.  However, she was born in Thailand, a citizen of the United States but subject to the same nonsense dumped on Obama, and anyway Biden does not need help to carry Illinois.  Jack the Ripper could carry Illinois.  Again, a really really good candidate in a couple of years. Harris has a lot of baggage.  She might help Biden carry California, but no current Democrat needs help to carry California.   Klobuchar is the strongest candidate, I think.  Picked up a lot of name recognition and a solid policy reputation in the primaries, and represents a more nearly normal state than Duckworth, Harris, or for that matter, Warren.   Warren could have been a contender, but skidded 'way too far left in pursuit of Bernie and went from a person with fairly solid leftish credentials to a higher-pitched version of the Distinguished Senator for Vermont.  Anyway, Massachusetts is regarded by most people west of the Hudson River as approximately equivalent to New York or California in its propensity to propound commie pinko policies.
