That assessment both correlates  with the weather window for offensive manoeuvres and provides some insight to how long intelligence agencies believe a siege would last.  Of course, this question isn't asking whether the Taliban will own Kabul by 1st Jan 2022, but on whether a man in a terrifying leadership position at this moment will still be in power by then.  Two very separate questions although clearly with a lot of interlocks. If Kabul is surrounded, and bearing in mind the gruesome history of Afghan presidents surrounded by the Taliban of old (1996) I'd suggest Ghani becomes far more likely to depart for a more friendly (and survivable) locale (which would seem to count as \"fleeing\" for this question's purposes).  This leaves a much closer window for occurrence (1 -2 months on the Taliban's current progress) and makes it much wider (2 - 3 months) for this question's forecast. Is there anything that appears likely to change the current pace of Taliban occupation?  Joe Biden's press statement today essentially telling the Afghan's to \"man up and use the tools we gave you\" doesn't suggest any real change of tack, and this bearing in mind he'll have access to far more sophisticated intelligence projections on the short and long term consequences of NOT acting.  NATO is incredibly unlikely to take any action without the US.  China seems content to open negotiations with the Taliban now in possible preparation for the inevitable end (as they see it).  Pakistan seem content to let the Taliban do all the work so far (and have clearly stated that Ghani's departure is a requirement for their sort of peace anyway[3]) and India do not seem interested in putting their hand into the hornet's nest at this time. With the current pace, with no obvious counter-Taliban intervention to slow it that seems likely at this moment and with Ghani's departure (via numerous possible doors) being a stated condition of any possible cessation of hostilities by the Taliban (who at this moment display largely uninterrupted progress towards their goals) the 30 day window for Kabul's isolation and 3 month projection for its fall seems feasible, credible and meaningful for this question's outcome. Moving back up to 85%.  Ghani is the national leader I feel most sorry for at this moment.

Such advice to one's own citizens can signal intelligence projections loudly and also indicate levels of confidence in certain outcomes (hence why some are declaring such travel guidance as an indicator of \"fair weather ally\" status [3]).

Fair to say that the sad and gruesome history of his predecessor will likely be present in Ghani's mind at this moment as well and may influence his judgement as things get (strategically and physically) closer to the capital's gates. EDIT:  also found this rather astounding statement from Ben Wallace, UK Defence Secretary, in mid July 21 [2] declaring a conditional willingness to work with a new Taliban led government.  Such a controversial statement would not be made unless this scenario had moved beyond \"possible\" to \"credible\" or, perhaps more likely, \"inevitable\" in the eyes of those who briefed the minister.  Such a statement to the UK's press would also not be made unless it was expected to be met with acceptance and (likely exhausted and fatalistic) agreement by those reading it. This may give an indication of the wider NATO / Western world mood to current events and perhaps an insight into the likelihood of some form of western intervention against the current course.

Fall of Lashkar Gah and/or Herat in the next 7 - 10 days now seems significantly more likely and are events which may well signal the real beginning of the end for the current administration. Key question: at what point does Ghani's position become untenable?  Is it purely when the Taliban are queuing up outside his office, or is it: -the loss of critical infrastructure?\n-the loss of critical logistics supply lines?\n-the loss of military & security force confidence and support?\n-the loss of international support?\n-an unhappy combination of some or all the above? What quantifies / qualifies as a \"critical loss\"?  What markers would we look for as forecasters to see these conditions being met? Trying to measure the impact of all these details is difficult (but that's part of the challenge), but loss of confidence and \"will to fight\" from within the Afghan Security Forces certainly seems to be a pretty conclusive one of this pack.  With the pace of DC take overs this weekend (and this before the US have entirely pulled out) we may need to account for a cascade failure of morale and fighting spirit within a significant portion of the security forces that may hasten a government minister departure and a transition to some form of interim government whilst the Taliban make their demands (and China underwrites the deals). Russia are likely taking a regional interest in this power play as well, although I would surmise that the Chinese are probably the preferred power broking partner for the Taliban at this moment (for fairly obvious reasons!). There is the open question of whether the US will reverse course and be pressured into delaying the withdrawal or returning, but with the military and political machinery in motion this would seem less likely at this moment (and not guaranteed to save Ghani's premiership even if it were to happen).  Given his willingness to commit to this course in his first year in office I don't see many signs Biden (or indeed the US in general) thinks Ghani's position is worth what it would cost them to save it. Whilst making these forecasts do take a moment to think of the man involved in this question and what he must feel like at this time.  I don't believe anyone here would want to swap seats.

China's increasingly reported engagement with the Taliban leadership is an interesting longer term indicator of where the worlds power brokers think the power is going to lay. China's reported and very public talks with the Taliban [1] are clearly self interested and highly pragmatic: a recognition that, irrespective of Ghani's survival in government, the Taliban aren't going anywhere and will remain the ruler of the rural areas where China's infrastructure projects are likely to run through. Whilst this may not be directly indicative for this question's posit, it's worth considering what the Taliban will be asking of the Chinese in return for unmolested passage and building of their silk road.  Power is the obvious answer: either power through arms and support or power through direct political influence and intervention.  In the face of this \"dragon influence\", and the US's reported (likely tepid but fatalistic) warmth towards China taking the reigns as a super power broker in the region, its hard to see who Ghani might call \"friend\" in this situation. Combine this with possibilities of assassination (either him or a close cabinet official that suitably scares him [2]) and there seem to be many vectors to Ghani's sudden and unannounced departure from his current position.  A lot of this will hang on the next few weeks and whether Lashkar Ghar (likely) and Kandahar (possible) will fall into Taliban control. I'd be cautious of putting too much stock in reported celebrations of the local populace in the face of Taliban defeats.  The average Afghan doesn't really care whos in charge so long as they can live, eat and not get shot.  Ending fighting seems to be the predominant interest for the majority, and if the Taliban take over I wouldn't expect to see any mobilisation of public support for Ghani in Taliban occupied zones. Change over of power has been such a frequent characteristic of life in that stunning but troubled land that it's almost common place for the average Afghan.

You then have the fact that the US is still providing air support (and looks likely to continue to do so), and that the Taliban's gains so far have been predominantly limited to the countryside. It also gets very cold in Kabul over winter, so if we presume that (a) the Taliban will likely need to take the capital in order for the government to fall and (b) it will be harder to take over winter, then the timeframe for action really is tight. None of these factors on their own make it impossible, but I think together they reduce the probability to around the 5% figure. You've then got the 'yes' factors - the speed of the Taliban's gains, the position of foreign powers (US seems very clear that it will not act beyond economic support and air strikes, Russia and China position is well documented over past week or so), the apparent problems within the Afghanistan National Army. If the deadline was 18 months later these factors may be strong enough to push me over 50%, but as things stand I think the timings are still too tight. All in all I'd say these factors push things up by about 20%. You've also got other routes to a yes beyond the Taliban taking Kabul - Ghani fleeing or ceasing to be president.

That said, news that foreign powers may already be courting Taliban leaders [1] indicates where major powers believe the wind is blowing, and the Taliban have today put Ashraf's departure as an explicit condition of any new negotiated governance [2]. They certainly appear to have the upper hand, and a Taliban move on Kabul seems less likely than simply starving the capital out and forcing a negotiated settlement. Biden's departure from Afghanistan seems very likely to have been decided in the face of objections from the Afghan premier, indicating that he may not have many friends in the places that have the means and interest in keeping him in the chair.  If major powers are all now courting both sides, Ashraf's position seems increasingly lonely and the results inevitable. Why should the Taliban wait before pressing their current advantage?  The longer they do the more capabilities can be brought in from the outside to interdict them, so the momentum of their take over seems likely to continue until it is forced into slowing down.   What would do that?  Clearly not the ANA or ANSF (although as they condense into a smaller ring their resistance seems likely to become marginally more effective, assuming they don't all down tools and disappear or switch sides).  The interest in outside help to prop up another Afghan government appears to have well and truly worn out (at least from the traditional western players): as the (adapted) saying goes: ISAF had the watches, Afghanistan had the time.  Sadly it seem her leaders squandered it, with these fairly inevitable results. There are also significant possibilities of an attempt on Ashraf's life (that would resolve this question, albeit in the grisliest of ways), and Afghanistan does have a history with this [3]. Lots of vectors to resolving (with time frame being the most pressing counter point) and few obvious mitigations to reduce likelihood (aside from the fact that it hasn't happened yet!). EDIT:  also worth remembering that Ashraf's rise to power itself took place under a fairly heavy cloud and a lot of power broking amongst uncomfortable allies [4].  Adds to the fragility of his position and the likely power broking going on with the Taliban by his competitors.
