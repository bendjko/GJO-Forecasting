Very likely Swalwell and possibly one more candidate will drop out (keeping an eye on Hickenlooper, although he has vowed to stay in the race; could be someone else or no one else). Looking this early in the past election seasons, typically candidates do not leave in droves at this stage. Looking at the month after the first debate there have been 0-2 drop outs in each presidential primary since 2004. Considering this, I raised the probability for 1-2 all the way to 83%.  I must admit, this strikes me as very high; however, every time I consider the alternatives - higher probabilities for 3-4 and 5+ candidates dropping out - I can't justify to myself that I should be raising those values more than I have. There being 1 drop out significantly improves the probability of 3-4 drop-outs - I'd say by a factor of 4x. While still unlikely, multiple longshot candidates might see this as an opportunity to leave gracefully (while not being the first to do so) especially with public/media perceptions of the fundraising numbers to be released this month.

John Hickenlooper\u2019s (D) campaign is facing major problems as many of his top staffers, including his campaign manager, communications director, digital director and finance director, have left or plan to leave in the near future, according to Politico.\n\nAdditionally, members of his senior staff have urged him to drop out of the presidential race as he fails to gain traction with primary voters and struggles with fundraising, including only $1 million raised in the second fundraising quarter, and to run for Senate against Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.). The fundraising total is not only miles behind other presidential candidates but also on par with or behind some Democratic Senate and House candidates. Hickenlooper publicly blamed his departed staffers in an interview for his fledgling campaign.\n\n\u201cWe thought it was time to make a change,\u201d he told MSNBC\u2019s Craig Melvin. \u201cYou know, these campaigns are long, hard campaigns and you don\u2019t always get it right with the first team.\u201d\n ~~~~~~ https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/03/us/politics/july-democratic-debate-participants.html \". . . A New York Times analysis of donor and polling data shows that as of Wednesday, seven candidates seeking the Democratic nomination are actively fighting for six slots in the coming debate, which again will be split over two nights, July 30 and 31.\n. . . \nSeven additional candidates, six of whom took part in last week\u2019s debates, have qualified only by one of two metrics \u2014 meeting the polling threshold \u2014 meaning they are on the bubble and the Democratic National Committee\u2019s tiebreakers will come into play. At the moment, former Representative John Delaney of Maryland, former Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado and Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio appear to have an advantage over the other four. Each of them has at some point earned 2 percent support in a qualifying poll, which raises their polling averages. (For the purposes of the tiebreaker, the D.N.C. will average each candidate\u2019s best three polls.) That leaves Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York and Representative Eric Swalwell of California in a virtual deadlock. Mr. Bullock is the only candidate in this group who did not debate last week. All four men appear to have the exact same polling average: 1 percent. The D.N.C. anticipated that this might happen, and officials said that in the event of a tie, they would rank the candidates based on \u201cthe total number of polls in which each candidate received 1 percent or more support.\u201d By our count, Mr. de Blasio has eight such polls, Mr. Bennet has six, Mr. Bullock has five and Mr. Swalwell has three. That\u2019s why the results of polls released in the next couple of weeks will be so important to those candidates. Each will be hoping to increase his polling average, add another 1 percent result to his tally, or both.\n. . . \nThe 14 candidates who have locked in a spot on the July debate stage by qualifying through both donors and polling, in alphabetical order, are: former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.; Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey; Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.; the former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro; Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii; Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York; Senator Kamala Harris of California; Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington; Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas; Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont; Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; the self-help author Marianne Williamson; and the former tech executive Andrew Yang. Who could get cut from the third debate? An even larger group of candidates is expected to be left off the stage for the third debate in September. The D.N.C. raised the qualification thresholds for it significantly. Candidates will need to have at least 130,000 donors and earn 2 percent support in at least four qualifying polls. And this time they will have to meet both standards to make the cut. Five of those seven \u2014 Mr. Biden, Mr. Buttigieg, Ms. Harris, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren \u2014 have routinely eclipsed 2 percent support in the polls and will presumably meet the polling requirement with ease. They are all but certain to earn a spot on the stage in September. A sixth, Mr. O\u2019Rourke, also has a track record of achieving 2 percent or higher in the polls, but a pair of post-debate surveys this week had him at 1 percent. Mr. Yang\u2019s campaign announced Monday that he had also exceeded 130,000 donors, making him the seventh candidate to do so. But Mr. Yang\u2019s support in the polls has wobbled between 0 and 2 percent, and it is not clear whether he will achieve 2 percent four times in a two-month window. The D.N.C. has said that only polls publicly released between June 28 and Aug. 28 can be used to help candidates qualify for the September debate. That means all the candidates have started counting again from zero. Candidates like Mr. Booker and Ms. Klobuchar often poll at 2 percent and above and may very well reach the polling threshold. But they could struggle to get to 130,000 unique donors. For just about everyone else, both the polling and donor thresholds present a significant challenge. Just this week, Politico reported that Mr. Hickenlooper had only 13,000 donors. So, it would not be at all surprising if the September debate ends up featuring 10 candidates or fewer. \u201cThe new 130,000-donor debate threshold is designed to cut candidates like me from the running,\u201d Mr. Castro wrote in an email to supporters days after the new debate qualification criteria were released. \u201cBut let me make one thing perfectly clear: I have never accepted defeat without a fight \u2014 and I have no intention of starting now.\u201d At the moment, former Representative John Delaney of Maryland, former Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado and Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio appear to have an advantage over the other four. Each of them has at some point earned 2 percent support in a qualifying poll, which raises their polling averages. (For the purposes of the tiebreaker, the D.N.C. will average each candidate\u2019s best three polls.) That leaves Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York and Representative Eric Swalwell of California in a virtual deadlock. Mr. Bullock is the only candidate in this group who did not debate last week. All four men appear to have the exact same polling average: 1 percent. The D.N.C. anticipated that this might happen, and officials said that in the event of a tie, they would rank the candidates based on \u201cthe total number of polls in which each candidate received 1 percent or more support.\u201d By our count, Mr. de Blasio has eight such polls, Mr. Bennet has six, Mr. Bullock has five and Mr. Swalwell has three. [What we learned from the first round of Democratic presidential debates.] That\u2019s why the results of polls released in the next couple of weeks will be so important to those candidates. Each will be hoping to increase his polling average, add another 1 percent result to his tally, or both. Three more candidates \u2014 Mayor Wayne Messam of Miramar, Fla.; Representative Seth Moulton of Massachusetts; and former Representative Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania \u2014 do not appear to have qualified for the debate via donors or polling. Though there is still time for that to change, those candidates will face an uphill battle for a spot on the stage, even if they manage to qualify.\n. . .

According the RealClearPolitics, half of the 20 candidates have average poll numbers less than 1% [1].  It is hard to believe that most of them believe that there is a chance to become the Presidential nominee.  Most of these candidates are in the race to raise their political profiles - for a cabinet job or future political activities.   With this as the motivation, one would think that it is too early to drop out after one debate.  However, in the 2016 Republican primaries,  1 out of 17 candidates dropped out after the first debate (in mid September,  much latter than the current first debate)  [2].  Scaling this to the current crop of 20 Democratic candidates yields 1.2 dropouts (essentially still 1 dropout).   To keep the campaign going, one needs funds.  Sixteen of the 20 candidates reported their haul in the first quarter of 2019.  Each of them have more than one million dollars [3].  The other 4 candidates have declared their candidacy too late for the March reporting cutoff.  It looks like that they have enough money to keep going after the first debate. Each candidate have about 10 minutes in the debate to make an impression, I would not be surprised that there is a breakout performance in the first debate for one or two of the low polling candidates.  But the others will linger in obscurity.  If I were one of them, I would not drop out right away, hoping for a second chance in the next debate (July 30-31).  I would expect lots of dropouts after this date. I am basing my forecast with the 2016 Republican primary results.

Fortunately, there is data available going back to 1980 [1] For candidate fields of 10 or more, the base rate is that 32% drop out before the Iowa caucuses (in February). If we assume that a drop out cannot happen before July (seems reasonable), then there are seven months from July of year X to Feb of year X+1 when a drop out can happen. If we then divide the 32% number equally across 7 months we get 4.5% of candidates who drop out per month. then out of the 20 Democratic candidates we\u2019d expect one to drop out in the next month.  How about the standard deviation? I calculated it at 11 percentage points. 1 SD away from the average is a percentage of 42% and 2 SD away is 53%. Divide both by 7 months as before and we get 6% and 7.5%, or 1 and 2 (1.5 before rounding) to drop out. Therefore, we\u2019d expect that in 95% of scenarios the number of candidates to drop out in the next month to be less than 2.  On the downside, 1 SD and 2 SDs equal 0.6 and 0.3 candidates to drop out.  Additionally, one has to account for the fact that the probability of dropping out rises as we get closer to Iowa. Therefore, my previous calculation, which assumes an equal probability of dropping out in July and in December for example, overestimates the probability of dropping out in the next month.  Qualitatively speaking I\u2019d not expect a candidate to drop out that soon. For candidates who are unlikely to win and therefore may drop out, the incentive for staying in the race for now is pretty much the same as the incentive for joining in the first place (i.e. raise your profile). It might have to take a really embarrassing performance in the first debate for a candidate to decide to drop out. Counterarguments: the base rate data uses a limited number of data points. The candidate field size of 20 is outstanding from the historical record. For future analysis: look more closely at the drop out rates in the 2016 GOP primary which saw 17 candidates and is the closest historical analog.
