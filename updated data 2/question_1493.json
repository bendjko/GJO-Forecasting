Domestically, the external shock from COVID-19 has sent the stock market into a bear market. The stock market has now stabilized from the severe drop, indicating that investment may steady out, but the stock market remains volatile. Unemployment remains high due to stay-at-home orders and a partial economic shutdown. Tables from Statista illustrate the resulting decreases in consumer income and spending. This trend is similar to decreased spending and income in China, although with more US citizens losing larger portions of income. As a result, a comparison can be made between China's first quarter GDP change and the GDP for the first quarter in the US, which will be released April 29. China marked a 6.8% contraction in GDP. Particularly when considering China's tendency to release rosier numbers than reality, this reversal of 6.1% growth in 2019 and 6.6% growth in 2018 leads to the conclusion that the US GDP will fall in the first and second quarters of 2020. US GDP growth over the last decade has ranged between 1.6 and 2.9%. In addition, China has seen less than 100 new cases per day for 30 days, whereas the US has not yet controlled the spread of coronavirus. This indicates that businesses will not fully reopen until the end of the second quarter, extending the decrease in consumer spending and income. Based on a case study comparison to China, the US will see negative real GDP growth in the first two quarters of 2020.   https://fortune.com/2020/04/16/china-q1-gdp-2020-coronavirus/\nhttps://www.statista.com/statistics/1107095/products-and-services-people-spend-less-on-due-to-the-covid-19-pandemic/\nhttps://www.statista.com/statistics/1108072/percentage-of-income-loss-due-to-the-covid-19-corona-pandemic/\nhttps://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/china/"], [61314, "2020-04-26T19:39:22Z", [1.0], "The NY Fed NowCast of 24 April has Q2 GDP at -7.79%.  \nThe Atlanta Fed NowCast of 24 April is -0.3%.\nThe St. Louis Fed NowCast of 24 April has Q1 GDP at -15.26%.\nThe Conference Board estimates of 09 April has Q2 GDP at -33.3%."], [86678, "2020-04-26T15:32:23Z", [0.99], ""], [87897, "2020-04-26T13:03:12Z", [1.0], ""], [76003, "2020-04-26T04:31:52Z", [1.0], ""], [41708, "2020-04-25T17:25:21Z", [0.99], ""], [10445, "2020-04-25T16:58:35Z", [1.0], ""], [87960, "2020-04-25T14:39:49Z", [0.7], ""], [87897, "2020-04-25T13:58:45Z", [1.0], ""], [80475, "2020-04-25T03:21:59Z", [1.0], "Er, I should probably move this up from my prior 20%, in the wake of COVID-19"], [87940, "2020-04-24T20:30:47Z", [1.0], "Covid 19"], [87938, "2020-04-24T19:32:21Z", [1.0], ""], [75863, "2020-04-24T19:21:17Z", [1.0], ""], [87923, "2020-04-24T18:44:43Z", [0.85], ""], [529, "2020-04-24T18:41:43Z", [1.0], "https://fortune.com/2020/03/20/recession-us-gdp-negative-growth-q2-predictions/ https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/20/goldman-sees-an-unprecedented-stop-of-economic-activity-with-2nd-quarter-gdp-contracting-by-24percent.html https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-gdp-pimco/us-gdp-will-contract-30-in-second-quarter-5-in-2020-pimco-idUSKCN21Q2VL\n"], [12622, "2020-04-24T17:19:50Z", [0.8], ""], [87932, "2020-04-24T16:36:43Z", [0.99], ""], [80634, "2020-04-24T14:24:06Z", [1.0], ""], [87897, "2020-04-24T14:21:19Z", [1.0], ""], [87924, "2020-04-24T13:56:02Z", [0.9], ""], [87897, "2020-04-23T21:52:54Z", [0.99], ""], [63842, "2020-04-23T18:44:54Z", [0.99], ""], [87303, "2020-04-23T18:35:19Z", [0.75], ""], [19127, "2020-04-23T16:47:10Z", [1.0], ""], [61314, "2020-04-23T15:40:15Z", [1.0], "4,427,000 new unemployment claims this week (and that is considered a good sign in some quarters since it's a decrease from the previous three weeks)."], [20558, "2020-04-23T11:17:31Z", [0.75], ""], [87878, "2020-04-23T11:04:28Z", [1.0], ""], [2965, "2020-04-23T07:31:21Z", [1.0], ""], [85069, "2020-04-23T07:28:19Z", [1.0], ""], [54962, "2020-04-23T07:13:47Z", [0.95], ""], [87869, "2020-04-23T03:20:19Z", [0.97], "Latest Philly Fed Coincident data for March shows 34 states showing contraction in economic activity vs. just 4 stable, and 12 expansions.

But want to be more analytical. US GDP is roughly $19.5 trillion. That's spending. Everyone's income is someone else's spending. In the Great Recession there was about a 3% drop initially in consumer spending and that was with a situation that was about 1/6 as bad as what we're seeing now. If, being lazy, I assume that business investment would drop similarly, then it's 3% across the board * 6.  So we can expect an 18% drop in spending over the year. That translates into roughly $3.5 trillion of lost spending (i.e. negative GDP growth). Now, government will try to fill that spending hole.  They just did a $2 trillion stimulus.  And those things have multipliers. $1 of stimulus can be $1.30 in spending for infrastructure or only $0.3 for things like corporate tax cuts.  In fact, this matters a lot because some kinds of stimulus COUNT as GDP (when government spends on a bridge) whereas other kinds do not count (e.g. a direct payment for unemployment). Government spend only counts directly if it is a \"spend\".  Now, I haven't researched the exact makeup of this recent stimulus but 1.2x is an ok rule of thumb: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304393210000553 So, stimulus is likely to \"act\" as if $2.4 trillion has been injected.  That leaves us short which means we'll see contraction. What's more, stimulus release is slow.  There are many news reports of the difficulty the US has had getting it out. And even if congress passes more stimulus, it takes time for these things to roll out and a timing mismatch will still result in a negative quarter. All that does though is confirm my initial 100% bias. Let me ask instead what would have to happen for there to not be negative growth:\na) In first quarter it would have to be that the growth we had in the 1st couple months offsets the loss we had in the last few weeks. Goldman Sachs predicts 0% growth first quarter. So let's say that's 50/50 for Q1.\nb) we're almost definitely seeing a drop in spend right now these first 2 weeks of April (6 million people going on unemployment per week) but imagine that everyone knows checks are coming and that some places re-open (e.g. NYC has now been so badly ravaged that like Italy or Spain, it might be able to start opening because there is immunity there). So then maybe we get growth in the second half of the quarter that offsets the first half?  Basically much of this depends on stimulus timing and the last 3 recessions stimulus has not been very well targeted because of politics. So let's say there is a 70% chance of Recession\nc) it's possible that by Q3 cities will be emerging, congress will do another stimulus (given political dynamics, stimulus is easier than in the past)... again, I think it depends on timing and targeting in stimulus... again, US tends to not target stimulus well. So let's say another 70%.\nd) I'm too far out for Q4 so let's just say there is a 50% chance of recession because there higher chance of recovery by then These quarters are not independent of one another but I don't know the math well enough to account for that. So I'll just say the odds of no recession is .5*.3*.3*.5 which is 2%."], [86658, "2020-04-10T22:53:26Z", [1.0], ""], [70711, "2020-04-10T18:54:36Z", [1.0], ""], [86796, "2020-04-10T18:28:54Z", [1.0], ""], [87150, "2020-04-10T18:02:08Z", [1.0], ""], [86261, "2020-04-10T09:37:53Z", [0.9], ""], [87099, "2020-04-09T23:23:18Z", [0.9], "I wanted to say 100% initially.

Domestically, the stock market entered into a bear market as a result of fear around COVID-19 in the US and whether the federal stimulus packages will be successful in mitigating its effects on US businesses. While the stock market has seen limited recovery, consumer confidence decreased to 89.1. In the midst of the 2009 recession, consumer confidence ranged in the 60s. Thus far, consumer personal spending has matched forecasts, however, spending on services offset decreases in spending on motor vehicles and parts as well as recreational goods and vehicles. Consumer spending culminates in 70% of the GDP, so this is an indicator for greater concern if it continues to drop. Today Trump signed Phase 3 of the relief bill after it passed through Congress. The stimulus and relief aid aims to counter the effects of limits on travel and 'nonessential' businesses across large sections of the country, which includes an unprecedented number of unemployment claims. Thus, GDP will likely drop in the first or second quarter as a result of drops in consumption despite stimulus attempts by increased government expenditures.   Internationally, it appears that China will rebound economically after the number of new coronavirus cases announced each day has dropped below 100. The worst case scenario continues to be that China's decreased production as a result of closed factories and cities compounded by high debt saturation could cause businesses or banks to fail. This could likely trigger losses in international markets, especially as consumer confidence decreases. Fortunately, it appears China's economy is undergoing normalization instead. In a best case scenario, China's production could recover or maintain at a level that minimizes impact on international markets. In addition, an international government effort could stimulate the economy sufficiently to limit decreases in GDP growth, but attempts at international action remain stilted. The international trend seen by the example China so far seems to indicate that the US GDP will likely see negative growth before a recovery.   https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/consumer-confidence\nhttps://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/personal-spending\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/panel-of-economic-commentators/2020/03/23/economic-recovery-from-covid-19-and-geopolitical-ramifications/#7bb24efc596e"], [61314, "2020-03-27T19:54:14Z", [1.0], "From U.S. News & World Report: \"The University of Michigan's popular consumer sentiment tracker dropped nearly 12% in March \u2013 its fourth-largest one-month decline in nearly 50 years, according to data published on Friday.

In the United States, the Bureau of Economic Analysis divides the GDP into 4 specific categories [2]: 1- Personal Consumption Expenditures (70%)\n2- Business Investment (18%)\n3- Government Spending (-5%)\n4- Net Exports of Goods and Services (17%) Due to the current shut-downs being undertaken by the retail, restaurant and travel industries, experts are predicting a 60%-70% drop in travel revenues, a 25% drop in restaurant spending, and a 60%-70% drop in hotel spend for the end of 1Q20 and most of 2Q20; additionally, loses in live entertainment revenues (theaters, sports, amusement parks, etc.) will result in an additional drop of 1.6% of personal consumer spending [3]. Referring back to reference [2], in 2019 the \"services\" sub-category of the \"personal consumption expenditures\" category accounted for appx $8.56B towards the 2019 GDP.  In fact, 4Q19 decreased in relation to the 3Q19 GDP due to downturns in current-dollar personal income, disposable income, and personal savings [4]. Further, analysts from Goldman Sachs estimate a 2Q20 GDP that shows a 24% decline from the 1Q20 GDP [5]. Further, other analysts anticipate that 2Q20 GDP will range between -8% to -15% [6]. This would be a shock to the economic system, as the last time the US encountered negative quarterly GDP growth was in 2009 [7]. Further exacerbating this problem are the non-essential movement shutdowns of multiple US cities including New York, San Fransisco and Seattle (amongst others) [8]. Regardless of city closures, multiple retailers have shut their doors to customers including Disney, Nike, Apple, and Starbucks (amongst others) [multiple sources]. Finally, due to the aforementioned closures, unemployment claims rose 33% in March [9] and forecasters anticipate that the unemployment report will range from 500,000 to 5 million claims in April, which are expected to be so bad that the White House has,  \"reportedly asked state officials to delay releasing precise counts\" and it is possible that the unemployment rate could spike to 10.6%[10]. Thus, I assess with a 100% probability that the US will experience at least 1 quarter negative real GDP growth due to the effects of COVID-19 responses at the city, state and federal levels, high unemployment, the closure of multiple retailers/entertainment companies, travel restrictions, and the lack of spending by US consumers.

Normally, a recession begins in one of two cases.  There is a fear of too much growth resulting in inflation, and the government slows the economy by means of reducing aggregate demand using increased interest rates, decreased the money supply, higher taxes or reduced government spending.  The greater the inflation risk, the greater the attempt to reduce inflation and the likelihood of a recession turns into a certainty.  Finally, the government tries to reverse the downturn by increasing aggregate demand by lowering interest rates, increasing the money supply, reducing taxes and/or increasing government spending.   The other cause is usually an external shock to the economy such as rising oil prices as in the late 60s, 70s and early 80s.  The increased costs to each firm in the economy created inflation, which Carter (at the very end of his term) and Reagan sought to defeat using the above-mentioned tools.  It was only after the collapse of oil price in 1983 that the economy recovered and the misery index (inflation plus unemployment) declined dramatically.  This is different.   Business are trying to prevent a greater pandemic catastrophe by shutting down, e.g., closing movie theaters, bars, restaurants, manufacturing, etc.   Therefore, all the attempts at creating economic growth by increasing demand will not work until the fear of the virus has disappeared -- or at least has been greatly reduced.  That is, businesses usually respond to increased demand for  goods and services by increasing output until all factors of production, i.e.., labor and capital, are in use.  Then, the economy is in equilibrium with full employment and low inflation -- as has been the case going back to sometime in 2010.  Right now, I think we are seeing something we have not seen since the pandemic of 1918.   That is, businesses and some factors of production, i.e., workers afraid of going to work, are withdrawing from the economy in the face of sufficient demand to keep them at full employment. I do not think we have seen this in over a century.  This reduces the output of goods and services, which is the definition of negative GDP growth.  Traditional government incentives to restore economic growth will not help as long as businesses and workers refuse to re-enter the economy.  The incentives to produce and to work in response to a full employment level of aggregate demand are already present.  The producers in the economy have simply said no and refused to produce out of fear of the coronavirus.  This has not happened in my lifetime, (absent a few strikes for higher wages.)

Two important trends to analyze are the reactions in the international market and in the domestic economy. Particular trends internationally are the effects from COVID-19 in China and the oil price war between Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. In a worst case scenario, China's decreased production as a result of closed factories and cities compounded by high debt saturation could cause businesses or banks to fail. This could likely trigger losses in international markets, especially as consumer confidence decreases. Current global consumer confidence in Asia-Pacific decreased by 1.0 and in Europe decreased by 2.0 points. A second key international trend is the oil pricing by countries in the Middle East and Russia, which could undercut US oil sources and increase volatility in the economy. However, in a best case scenario, China's production could recover or maintain at a level that minimizes impact on international markets. In addition, an international government effort could stimulate the economy sufficiently to limit decreases in GDP growth.  Domestically, the stock market entered into a bear market as a result of fear around COVID-19 in the US and whether the federal stimulus packages will be successful in mitigating its effects on US businesses. The current GDP growth is around 2.1, and dipped into the negatives just three times in the last decade, such as the Great Recession. Viewing this bear market as event-driven, a Goldman Sachs strategist has noted that most bear markets triggered by exogenous shocks resulted in 29% declines and recovered within 15 months. The current stock market has not yet seen this severe of a decline and it should be noted that the economy and the stock market do not necessarily mirror each other. US government officials are currently creating and releasing stimulus package proposals to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 on the economy; officials also state they expect a quick economic recovery. With this early effort and similar international level talks, I forecast that losses will be felt primarily by those sectors directly impacted by COVID-19 such as travel and tourism.  Therefore, my ultimate prediction is for limited GDP growth in the beginning of 2020 but a low chance of a negative quarter. This forecast will change pending updates on the spread of COVID-19, the financial security of Chinese markets, and whether confidence in the US stock market recovers.   https://finance.yahoo.com/news/may-feel-2008-over-again-040100877.html\nhttps://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/gdp-growth\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/goldman-sachs-analyzed-bear-markets-back-to-1835-and-heres-the-bad-news-and-the-good-about-the-current-slump-2020-03-11"], [84880, "2020-03-11T23:35:10Z", [0.26], ""], [767, "2020-03-11T23:08:18Z", [0.55], ""], [57778, "2020-03-11T23:03:34Z", [0.55], ""], [82333, "2020-03-11T19:11:12Z", [0.55], ""], [84880, "2020-03-11T18:38:17Z", [0.27], ""], [534, "2020-03-11T17:27:46Z", [0.68], ""], [81559, "2020-03-11T15:43:47Z", [0.95], ""], [54646, "2020-03-11T15:38:28Z", [0.25], "likely the second or third quarters will reflect the collapse of the global supply chains and reduced demand"], [57797, "2020-03-11T12:58:09Z", [0.48], ""], [29896, "2020-03-11T11:24:55Z", [0.45], ""], [61314, "2020-03-11T05:32:17Z", [0.5], "As I mentioned in earlier posts, I think \"debt\" could be the downfall here.

On the one hand, consumer spending \u2013 the workhorse of GDP \u2013 is doing pretty well.  The job situation is good, consumer sentiment is high, and retail sales were good in January.  Plus there have been some little-followed forward indicators of good times ahead.  For example, the Architectural Billing Index \u2013 which is allegedly a long-leading indicator of economic optimism -- was up at the end of the year, and small business optimism increased in January.  So there are definitely some strong indicators of a good year ahead for the economy. But industrial production slumped in January, and although we\u2019re more of a service economy now (and the ISM non-manufacturing index increased to 55.5% in January), industrial production still means something.  Plus, there were some surveys of CEOs and CFOs not long ago that were pretty pessimistic.  And economic-related transportation indicators \u2013 port activities, trucking, etc. \u2013 have been in the doldrums.   Also of note, our major trading partners are not doing so well.  China, obviously, has the Corona virus to contend with.  But Japan just reported out a Q4 QoQ 6.3% decrease, and Germany, France, and Italy have all been experiencing recent economic malaise.   But most troubling is the debt situation.  The Fed reported that total household debt increased by $193 billion (1.4%) to $14.15 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2019.  This is just one aspect of the increase in total global debt to over $250 trillion.  And right in the middle \u2013 between student and household debt on one side, and corporate and government debt on the other \u2013 is small business debt, the problems of which were documented here in December: https://medium.com/trading-politics/this-will-cause-the-next-financial-crisis-e102264fe511 With that sort of debt -- and equities markets that many people think are wildly overvalued -- my concern is that it will just take a small shock to start a domino effect of defaults and whatnot.  And the potential shocks are out there.  The Corona virus, obviously.  But also the fires in Australia, Brexit, Iran (which I don\u2019t think is done avenging Soleimani\u2019s death). So with all that in mind, I am raising my forecast to 28.  Although there have only been a handful of recessions since WWII, there have been three distinct quarters on negative real GDP growth in the past 10 years.

The Coronavirus is already having an impact on the global economy, it just remains to be seen where it ends.  Brexit seems relatively benign at this point, but there could be some relatively near-term unexpected negative consequences.  And I don't think we're quite done with the Iranians avenging Soleimani's death.  Just to name a few things. Then there's the Fed and the stock market. The Fed has signaled an intent to keep rates unchanged for a while.  But the market -- riding sky high -- is signaling it expects a rate cut.  If the Fed does, in fact, cut rates, it could signal that it thinks the economy is weakening.  If it doesn't cut rates, the market could take a bit hit (and cause ripples downstream). It's almost as if the bet isn't so much about the economy itself; rather, the bet is on whether some external event will knock it off kilter enough for one quarter.

I'm taking cafebedouin's 14% base rate, and adding a few points based on the NY Fed's December 2019 forecast that there's a 24% chance of a recession in the next 12 months. In terms of what I think, on the one hand, the components of GDP are looking good. GDP is made up of consumer spending, business investment, government spending, and net exports.  If you discount shocks, again, most of those look good.  Consumer spending, which is the 800 pound gorilla of GDP, is good with no end in sight (tight labor market, high consumer sentiment).  Government spending is going nowhere but up under this President.  And net exports are heading in the right direction, even though it's a small component.  Business investment is the only laggard.   On the other hand, there are some concerns. Last year the 2/10 yield curve inverted, which has historically been a long-lead indicator of a recession. I think there are a lot of cracks in the old economic models that are tied to that, but it happened nonetheless and can't be entirely discounted. If you look at the CME FedWatch Tool, by December 2020 over 50% of the bet is on lower interest rates, meaning there is the expectation of a weaker economy. More troublesome than both of those is the amount of debt.  In particular, there might be some problems with small business debt: https://medium.com/trading-politics/this-will-cause-the-next-financial-crisis-e102264fe511. If this article is accurate, this really bears some watching as it could bring the whole house of cards tumbling down. And then there's Trump.  There is a lot of chatter about how Trump and the compliant Fed won't let the economy suffer in an election year.  Well, Trump has seriously irked a few countries in the past three years -- China and Iran come immediately to mind -- that might have some other ideas.  This is one President a lot of the world would like to see go away, and perhaps a few of the bigger players might pull some of their own trade stunts to try undermining him.
