The vote is looking like it will be 51-49 in favor of Coney Barret\u2019s confirmation, with all 47 Dems opposing, joined by Republicans Murkowski and Collins. -- GOP DEFECTORS. There aren\u2019t any remaining Republicans likely to break rank and vote against Coney Barret\u2019s confirmation. Rand Paul is a yes (https://www.paul.senate.gov/news/dr-rand-paul-releases-statement-barrett-nomination) and other possible Republican renegades, like Mitt Romney, Cory Gardner, Lamar Alexander, and Chuck Grassley, have all spoken positively about Coney Barrett\u2019s qualifications. If any other GOP senators were planning to vote against, I think they would have opposed already on procedural grounds, like Murkowski and Collins have. Opposing on the nominee's merits seems unlikely, as nothing about Coney Barret\u2019s qualifications, character, or record seem likely to be off-putting for GOP senators, and it would take a serious issue to cause a GOP senator to defy their party so flagrantly at this late hour. Recall that Kavanaugh was approved with full GOP support and all GOP senators but one (Romney) supported Trump during his impeachment trial. -- COVID VOTE COMPLICATIONS. Covid could of course interfere with the vote. However, this still seems like a very unlikely path to a Pence tie-breaker because the cases and timeline would need to fall just so in order to achieve this result.  Here's some background: as of October 12th (https://www.npr.org/2020/04/15/833692377/how-the-coronavirus-has-affected-individual-members-of-congress), there are 5 senators who have tested or presumed to have tested positive (Johnson, Lee, Tillis, Cassidy, Paul). Of these, three (Lee, Cassidy, and Paul) have left quarantine and resumed in-person activities. The other two (Tillis and Johnson) have had mild cases that were diagnosed around October 3rd. Since mild cases typically resolve within 1-2 weeks, the currently quarantined senators seem likely to recover in time for the committee and floor votes. Three other Republican senators (Cruz, Lankford, and Sasse) also entered quarantine around October 2nd and all seem in good health - doesn't seem like an issue will arise there. My impression is that the Rose Garden ceremony was a superspreader event, but it happened far enough before the senate floor vote that the mild covid cases that resulted will resolve quickly enough to not pose an issue for Republicans by the end of October, when the floor vote is happening. Additionally, after 3 GOP senators tested positive, McConnell put the Senate in recess and I assume senators of both parties are now acting with increased precautions following the illnesses of their colleagues, so additional cases seem unlikely. Of course it\u2019s possible that, between now and the vote, exactly two additional Republican senators will contract covid, with no Dems falling ill, but it seems highly unlikely."], [48081, "2020-10-11T22:44:00Z", [0.04], "It is unlikely that another republican Senator will vote to oppose ACB.

But we have to consider that these events likely influence each other, e.g. one Senator voting no might inspire more defectors.  Even multiplied by a factor of 100, we're still only at a 4% chance of Mike Pence casting a tie-breaking vote.  This is even further complicated by the fact that at least two Republican Senators (Mike Lee, Tom Thillis) contracted COVID-19 within the last few days. It creates all sorts of scenarios in which some Senators can't vote, which muddles the math even more. If Lee and Thillis are unable to vote, we only need 1 defector. It's difficult to calculate the probability that Lee and Thillis will be unable to vote, so that's something I'll have to monitor in the coming days/weeks. https://projects.propublica.org/represent/members/R000615/votes-against-party/116\nhttps://projects.propublica.org/represent/members/M001153-lisa-murkowski/votes-against-party/116\nhttps://projects.propublica.org/represent/members/C001035-susan-collins/votes-against-party/116"], [96204, "2020-10-03T13:49:04Z", [0.7], ""], [92232, "2020-10-03T12:01:24Z", [0.07], ""], [92232, "2020-10-03T12:00:01Z", [0.4], ""], [93028, "2020-10-03T10:17:42Z", [0.02], "agreeing with with https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1150008"], [87427, "2020-10-03T10:16:42Z", [0.03], ""], [79464, "2020-10-03T08:53:23Z", [0.0], ""], [79464, "2020-10-03T08:53:14Z", [0.01], ""], [79464, "2020-10-03T08:53:03Z", [0.05], ""], [92863, "2020-10-03T08:20:57Z", [0.09], ""], [87744, "2020-10-03T08:02:00Z", [0.1], ""], [67232, "2020-10-03T07:00:56Z", [0.01], ""], [67232, "2020-10-03T07:00:09Z", [0.15], "Senator Tom Tillis has covid and possibly some comorbidities.
