Purchasing Power Parity: Using Purchasing Power Parity theory, specifically, comparing the price of a Big Mac in the UK versus one in the Eurozone, suggests a rate of about 1.24.   Relative Economic Strength: Quarter-on-quarter economic growth rates (data from the Office of National Statistics in the UK and Eurostat for the Eurozone), indicates that the average quarter-on-quarter growth of the last six quarters in the UK is 0.31% and for the Eurozone, is 0.417%. This is a soft case for Euro appreciation. The European Central Bank's interest rate is -0.50% and the Bank of England's bank rate is 0.75%.  The higher interest rate in the UK will attract those investors looking to earn the highest yield on investments, whereas the negative interest rate in the Eurozone will attract borrowers or carry-trade speculators. I believe that this tilts marginally in favour of the GBP in the long-run. Expectations: Expectations are largely framed by the biggest geopolitical event governing relations between the two, in decades: Brexit. My reading is that markets expect an extension on negotiations and a delay on Brexit, (pamphlets obtained by the BBC imply that the Tories are preparing for a delay on Brexit) and confirmation of this should give the Pound a boost. No Deal will hurt the Pound, at least in the short-term, and that short-term could be over by Nov 1.  Forecast: As I write, the GBP-Eur rate is 1.1499. My feeling is, there will be a delay on Brexit, but I am not sufficiently bullish on that to write-off the chances of a No Deal Brexit -Brexit with a deal suggests Parliament approving a deal the vast majority will not have read, a staggering dereliction of duty-. There is, of course, a marginal chance that the rate swims between 1.00 and 1.10 -for now, I am dismissing the possibility given that the last time the GBP-Eur last nearly hit 1.0 was in the wake of the 2008 crisis and the UK was in the throes of a deep recession-. I think even with a hard Brexit, the markets have baked much of that in so the downside risk is lower than if No Deal was completely unexpected. I think fair value for the GBP-Eur sits at 1.19-1.29 but the question is when does the GBP-Eur start to move within that range?"], [80066, "2019-10-15T13:34:27Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [80063, "2019-10-15T13:25:54Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [80051, "2019-10-15T10:55:45Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [80047, "2019-10-15T09:29:24Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], "Will give more time to settle brexit, same as before"], [80042, "2019-10-15T08:37:37Z", [0.4, 0.6, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [80037, "2019-10-15T07:59:12Z", [0.2, 0.8, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [80039, "2019-10-15T07:57:18Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [80031, "2019-10-15T07:16:09Z", [0.05, 0.25, 0.4, 0.25, 0.05], "Based on where it\u2019s sitting now"], [80029, "2019-10-15T07:00:54Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.7, 0.15, 0.05], "Whim"], [42004, "2019-10-15T06:59:33Z", [0.0, 0.4, 0.55, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [42004, "2019-10-15T06:59:14Z", [0.0, 0.4, 0.6, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [80009, "2019-10-15T04:51:57Z", [0.9, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [80010, "2019-10-15T04:48:35Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [79991, "2019-10-15T04:02:38Z", [0.15, 0.5, 0.25, 0.05, 0.05], ""], [79989, "2019-10-15T03:59:04Z", [0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [79987, "2019-10-15T03:50:58Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5], ""], [79979, "2019-10-15T03:36:44Z", [0.15, 0.85, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [79931, "2019-10-15T01:54:07Z", [0.02, 0.25, 0.51, 0.2, 0.02], "if brexit happened cleanly a sharp rise of the GBP, however i think it is not going to be so clean and different aspects could prevent a sharp rise, currenta 1 year avg 1.13 with 7% volatility"], [63835, "2019-10-14T23:50:40Z", [0.04, 0.45, 0.5, 0.01, 0.0], "closed at 1.14 today.\nwas 1.15 last week from 1.10 - speculation is the happy talk in the papers of a \"detailed and constructive discussion\" - whatever that means.\nCould GBP be strengthening merely on the belief of an orderly exit - whether WA or A50?"], [77954, "2019-10-14T23:30:08Z", [0.85, 0.1, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [172, "2019-10-14T19:59:08Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.95, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2019-10-14T18:44:30Z", [0.0, 0.3, 0.65, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [57797, "2019-10-14T16:58:41Z", [0.0, 0.03, 0.96, 0.01, 0.0], "Latest results from Random Walk model.

I update my forecast by applying a new method to account for this. The new model has 2 steps. 1) Project price on Oct 31 similarly to how other financial questions are modeled, using a Geometric Random Walk model [1]. This model uses historical frequencies in daily price changes from the last 10 years. In other words, it assumes the distribution of future scenarios will be based on the *long-run* historical volatility. Since we know that the long-run historical volatility is likely not representative of November 1, we need step 2: 2) Project the price on November 1. I multiply the projected distribution of prices on Oct 31 from step 1) by a random change. How large can this change be? Since we expect greater than usual volatility, I took the 10 most volatile days in in the historical data and built a distribution. The average percent change among these 10 days (absolute value) was actually not very large (3%). The model selects a certain daily change at random and applies it to the Oct 31 price. By repeating this process many times, I get a distribution of all possible futures. Result from step 1 for distribution of price on Oct 31: 0.2, 40.39, 58.06, 1.35, 0.0 Result after step 2 for distribution of price on Nov 1: 1.4, 41.57, 51.61, 5.4, 0.0 ~~~\nInside View\n~~~ This result is perhaps somewhat surprising given that one may expect Brexit to lead to a lot of volatility. But what the historical data shows us is that for the  pound-euro pair there is not much precedent that would justify high percentages in the 1st and 4th or 5th buckets. One reason why we may not expect these buckets to materialize is that the fortunes of the EU and the UK often move in tandem, meaning the currency pair does not see as much volatility as the GBP-USD for example. My assumption is that in this particular case as well, volatility related to Brexit will impact both the euro and the GBP, and subsequently mute impacts on the pound-euro pair. I am still keeping a slightly wider distribution than suggested by the model, since to some degree Brexit is an unprecedented event.

General consensus seems to be that the EU can weather a hard Brexit (96% likely according to betting markets) better than the UK. Brexit has already hit UK GDP, national income, and business investment. Meanwhile, I don't buy the argument that the EU will substantially lose by virtue of a smaller market for two reasons:\n1. Businesses, consumers, and even the government are already stockpiling goods from the bloc\n2. Supply/Demand dynamics say that (in the absence of another major trading partner) demand for EU products force UK consumers to bear the costs of tariffs and duties These factors make me increase my probability in the 1 -1.1 bin (thinking the Pound will fall to the lower part of the range), but reduce it in the <1 bin (I think these options are mostly OTM hedgers) and >1.2 bins.

Taking as baseline June 23 2016 (date of Brexit referendum) (1.30541 EUR/1GBP)  it took out all prior lows since 2011, and created a new low of 1.10651 on Oct 14 2016.\nIt then tested and penetrated that low, and established a new low of 1.07965 Aug 30, 2017.\nSince then it's established a rough +- 7% trading range from 1.10404 (Aug 27, 2018) to 1.17576 (May 6, 2019). Then it collapsed almost straight down - 5.6% to its present 1.11293 (and is slightly off a recent bottom). A strengthening would arise from stable government and higher central bank rates. Neither is present, and neither is likely through Nov 1 2019. \nIn fact no central bank - BOE, the Fed, ECB - seem ready to do anything other than to return to low rates and QE if needed. We've seen enough European negative yield bonds to see that is the ECB's go-to move to keep European commerce going. The other two can't be far behind in their thinking. Given likely trade disruptions post-Brexit alone, UK would advantaged by using a weaker currency so as to sell abroad (but will hurt when they have to import a total of USD $673 billion and pay in a week currency.

So it looks like a weaker currency for the pound on Nov 1 2019 - but how much weaker?

Outlook for GBP bearish from here as markets continue to price in some hope for a business-friendly resolution of the crisis. In actual fact there is now no mechanism in place to avoid a hard Brexit, which is bearish for Sterling with a downside in excess of 10% due to trade disorder, decreased competitiveness of UK goods in Europe and increased import costs for UK consumers. Also uncertainty around Scotland and NI subsequently opting to leave the UK in order to maintain access to European markets in the event of a disorderly Brexit is an ongoing long term tailwind for Sterling that\u2019s not fully priced in yet. This will price in fully once markets accept inevitability of a hard / no-deal Brexit. The reason why there is no mechanism to avoid hard Brexit is due to 100% certainty that the next PM, whoever it is, has already committed themselves to the path of a no-deal Brexit without the possibility of another outcome. The Brexit wing of the Tory party have effectively completed their take-over of the party with the clear intent to pursue Brexit at all costs. Markets have not yet adequately priced in the behavior change in the Tory party: specifically that traditional Tory behavior of pursuing market-friendly policies can no longer be relied on. Commitment to a non-customs union Brexit has become the superordinate goal of Tory leaders. This outcome can only be avoided if a general election takes place prior to October 2019. I view this probability is low due to Brexit group determination to cling to power until \u201cjob is done\u201d. A vote of no-confidence could trigger a collapse of the new government and trigger an election, this also seems unlikely (less than 5%). Moreover, this unlikely chain of events would not lead to a substantial improvement in Sterling inside the Horizon of my forecast beyond my base case, at best we might expect Sterling to trade where it is today due to ongoing uncertainty. My forecast reflects this. My mental model for forming this view is strongly influenced by the work of AJP Taylor, notably his book \u201chow wars begin\u201d. This is not a war, obviously; however the book demonstrates how political actors can set in motion chains of events that they themselves subsequently lose control of (in the book, essentially, all courses of action except war are closed off making it inevitable)."], [75714, "2019-07-11T14:53:24Z", [0.14, 0.36, 0.44, 0.04, 0.02], "The futures market's currently at ~1.106 (https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/fx/g10/euro-fx-british-pound.html), with movement of the July rate about 0.05 since April, so using that as standard deviation odds'd probably be around 2%, 43%, 52%, 3%, 0%.
