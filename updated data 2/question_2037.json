Winning 3/4 of the previous gold medals suggests a 75% win rate.  Likewise, the United States has won the last 2 world cups (and lost in the final 3 world cups ago).  Considering that these tournaments function similarly, this gives an estimated win rate of roughly 5/7 or 71% win rate at major tournaments.  This pushed me to increase my estimated win rate to 60%.  One reason I estimate lower than my base rate is that the women's team has had a longer layoff between major tournaments than normal, and their schedule has been less competitive than normal as of late.  Therefore, I think the team could be slightly rusty and susceptible to an upset.
