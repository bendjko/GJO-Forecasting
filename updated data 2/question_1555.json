Given I don\u2019t know much about the oil market I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll fare any better. However, let\u2019s start off by trying to put some crude base rates on what the price of WTI might do. As of close of business 27th March WTI Crude Oil was trading at $21.51 a barrel. There are roughly 1.5 months until the forecast date, which is approximately 31 trading days. Using data from FRED (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DCOILWTICO), we can calculate the historical 1.5 month realised volatility of WTI going back to 1986.  https://pasteboard.co/J1lkszJ.png The average is 14.1%, but as you can see from the graph in the link above it varies massively. There seems to be infrequent but massive spikes in the level of realised volatility. While the long run average 1.5-month volatility of WTI is 14.1%, over the past 12 months it\u2019s actually only been 12.3%! https://pasteboard.co/J1m2ERt.png I expected this to be much much higher, but volatility was actually quite low before the recent Russia/Saudi tiff. Over the past month (after it all kicked off) the 1.5-month realised volatility has unsurprisingly rocketed up to an average of 20.4%. So what should we use for our base rate over the next month-and-a-half? I\u2019m going to na\u00efvely take an average of the 3 averages and assume the volatility of WTI until the forecast date will be 15.6%. Note: This all assumes a normal/Gaussian distribution, which I am well aware, does not translate to the real world. I\u2019m merely using it as a rough guide. So based on the current price of $21.51, a volatility of 15.6% means there should be a 68% chance that oil will end up between $18.16 (21.51 * 0.844) and $24.86. There is a 27% chance the price will move between 1 and 2 standard deviations and end up between 14.80 (21.51 * 0.688) and 18.15 or 24.87 and 28.22 (21.51 * 1.312).  And a 5% chance it will end up outside of that. This does not align neatly with the options given in the question, but we can roughly put the %\u2019s in to get a base case of:\nLess than $25.00: 68% +13.5% + 2.5% = 84%\nBetween $25.00 and $35.00, inclusive: 13.5% (understating it a bit I know) Which leaves only 2.5% for the remaining options, which I\u2019ll allocate in a 3:2:1 format to get: More than $35.00 but less than $45.00: 1.25%\nBetween $45.00 and $55.00, inclusive: 0.8%\nMore than $55.00: 0.45% So know that we have a VERY na\u00efve outside view, let\u2019s look at the inside view. The Coronavirus means there is currently a vastly reduced demand for oil. There is also an increased supply due to Russia walking out on OPEC+ and the Saudi\u2019s pumping up their output in retaliation.  At the current price there\u2019s going be a lot of US shale producers that default. But are they going to do so in the next month and a half? Or stop pumping in that timeframe? I\u2019m not sure. Russia will suffer if oil stays at the current price - the ruble has already depreciated 22% this year vs. the dollar and obviously they will get less revenue from the oil they do sell. However, they claim that they can withstand oil prices of $25-30 a barrel for the next 6-10 years and have an oil break-even price of $42 a barrel vs. c.$80 a barrel for Saudi Arabia in terms of their fiscal budgets (https://www.ft.com/content/4009472c-620e-11ea-b3f3-fe4680ea68b5 - sorry, pay wall). So they seem likely to be in this for at least the medium-term. Saudi Arabia needs an oil price of $80/barrel to get to a balanced budget. But they are the ones who started flooding the market with an extra 2.5m barrels a day when Russia walked out on OPEC+ (https://www.ft.com/content/755663c0-62ad-11ea-a6cd-df28cc3c6a68\n). I find it difficult to see them relenting before May 13th, albeit I expect either Russia or Saudi will come back to the negotiating table in the medium-term. So given all this info, perhaps I should be adjusting my forecast to put EVEN more weight on the lower prices? Alas, I'm not going to do that. I feel my crude model probably understates the potential volatility of oil over the next while and I feel very uneasy assigning only 13.5% to the $25-35 range. So I've adjusted my final numbers to put more weight on that target price, and a bit more on the tail cases too."], [691, "2020-03-29T13:39:30Z", [0.36, 0.52, 0.12, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [57427, "2020-03-29T08:09:16Z", [0.65, 0.2, 0.15, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [40584, "2020-03-28T22:53:16Z", [0.48, 0.47, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [40584, "2020-03-28T22:53:01Z", [0.45, 0.5, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [79464, "2020-03-28T18:30:53Z", [0.47, 0.45, 0.08, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [45594, "2020-03-28T09:34:27Z", [0.6, 0.3, 0.05, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2020-03-28T08:00:06Z", [0.52, 0.46, 0.02, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [86748, "2020-03-28T01:09:39Z", [0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "Demand will continue to be a problem.

I largely agree. Two comments:  1) What are the strategic objectives of Saudi Arabia and Russia? I agree that the primary immediate driver is tit-for-tat strategy. However I think its a mistake to assume that is all. It appears that they are trying to send fear into the market and thereby destabilize competing investments such as US shale. Certainly they aren't doing anything that signals a desire to ease pain or fear for the rest of the market. If that's a goal, we should ask: \"how long would it take to put a serious and sustainable dent in US production?\"  If that's their goal then I would expect them to keep up wild gyrations and unpredictable and painful behavior for as long as it takes (6 months?) to drive lenders in the US to not view US shale oil as a good investment. Russia and SA both have a huge competitive advantage (among others) in that they don't need to keep bankers happy. \n2) Why are they doing this now? Maybe: now is a good time if you assume prices are going to be down for a while anyway, so you might as well get to the point of fear and capitulation for the marginal producers. I don't think they would have reacted this way in a booming, stable economy. \n3) what will economic growth be in 2020? I don't share your view that the course of the epidemic in Europe and the US will match the quick up and down of round 1 in China. The US is failing at containment and even in Italy the actions appear to fall short so far. More importantly these actions can't be maintained for more than a few months due to the cost. At some point China and other countries need to get back to business and when that happens I fear the virus will come back.

Why the Oil Price Crash of 2020 will be short January 2020 brought troubles to the oilfield, a coronavirus known as CoVid-19. Originating in China, it spread faster than flu, and more deadly. To combat it, Chinese authority imposed quarantines, and other social distancing measures. It worked, but the engines of industry ground down and the Chinese economy needed less and less oil. This led to a surplus of 2+ million barrels per day.  Fast forward to March, a worldwide pandemic is underway and economies are slowing down rapidly. IHS Markit believes CoVid-19 will cause 3.8 million barrels spare capacity to hit the markets.  OPEC + has suffered a possible fatal blow, Russia no longer wants to go along with cuts recommend by OPEC led by Saudi Arabia. So the Saudis have ramped up production to 12 million to flood the market and teach Russia a lesson about unity. That now puts 5.8 million surplus barrels into the worlds supply. That is why oil has fallen from $50s down to $27 before it stabilized at $33 at the time of this writing. In a nutshell, this is a show of spite in game theory.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spite_(game_theory)\nSaudi and Russia did not agree upon some master strategy to destroy American shale production to regain market share, cripple the global economy for world domination, or part of some scheme by the Illuminati to take control of the UN.  Rather it is just a punitive action against a reticent partner. It occurred after a failed negotiation that gives us a clue to the duration.  Saudi has cash reserves to go 3 years at $33/bbl and make their budget, Russia for even longer. Sure, one could argue they could drain their reserves to teach the other a lesson, but that is not rational behavior by heads of state. Russia just wanted a better deal, the Saudis wanted fairness. They will likely hammer out a palatable comprise within weeks. Rumors have it that negotiations are still happening.  On the other hand, China has shown signs that it\u2019s epidemic has burned out. We expected a normal epidemic curve of 2-3 months up, and 2-3 months down, but if we are to trust Chinese numbers, they suppressed the epidemic curve to just 3 months. There is now an immediate push to jump up the economy, within weeks or months they should be consuming more oil, hopefully taking 1-2 million barrels off the market. That is good news, and better, inevitable. Almost nothing can stop the post-epidemic recovery, for any country. I took a survey of oilfield executives and asked the simple question of \u201cHow many months will oil stay below $40/bbl?\u201d  Answers: 2,2,3,5,6,6,9,9,12   Mean: 6  StDev:3.4  68% range: 2.5 to 9.5 months. If a Saudi-Russian reduction agreement happens, oil should at least get to the mid 40s range. Then if China gets back on line, they should drive up oil ~$5/bbl more. It may be up to a year before we hit mid $50 oil, but upper $40s should happen within 3-6 months. @Emil @Anneinak @cdob63 @cmeinel @dlaiocean @Dillyweed @dsarin\n"], [86011, "2020-03-12T03:39:31Z", [0.06, 0.22, 0.38, 0.28, 0.06], ""], [1646, "2020-03-12T03:36:02Z", [0.01, 0.45, 0.45, 0.09, 0.0], ""], [38094, "2020-03-12T03:30:35Z", [0.15, 0.5, 0.35, 0.0, 0.0], "What will be the closing price per barrel for (WTI) crude oil on 13 May 2020, according to Bloomberg?\nMarch 11 late =$31.24 / bbl a drop of over $22 in 3 weeks.

On second thoughts, due to corona's impact on the worldeconomy the chances of very low prices might be a big higher than otherwise. If the current situation is similar to the situation in the beginning of 2016, then price will at some point go back to the 40-55 region, so most of the probability is focussed in that region, with some probility in the two adjecent domains.  This article is interesting to have a bit of a background:\nhttps://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/09/opec-russia-shale-oil-price-collapse/ Not sure how this information should influence my estimates however. It seems that the collaps of the US shale industry woul have a substantial impact on the system with a large increase in price per barrel. However, Trump would have incentives to prevent this collaps, even though its unclear if he would act on them. Such effects are less likely to be visible on a shorter timescale however (most likely not before may i'm guessing).

When Secretary Pompeo was in Eastern Europe earlier in the year and offered to sell them as much oil and gas at a market rate, this probably sparked Russian unease and drove the Russians to seek to push the US out of the fossil fuel energy production. 3) US oil producers have their entire 2020 production hedged out through the year end into the start of 2021. Therefore, any desire to put pressure on these producers by the Saudis and the Russians and OPEC+ means that they have to keep the price low or drive it lower throughout the year. Hence, my confidence in a very low oil forecast. This forecast is also very low because when markets collapse like this they can stay quite low for longer periods than most people expect and they tend to build a base before prices go up again. 4) There exists the outside possibility but worth noting because of its strategic importance that US oil producers are cooperating with the Russians and the Saudis based on their mutual desire to push oil prices so low that it upends the world movement to renewable energy and puts the electric car industry out of business. It could simply be their overarching objective through the year 2021 that they all will lower oil prices to the floor and keep their consumers using oil in all things and forget about carbon taxes, renewable energy, and non-internal combustion engine powered vehicles."], [60695, "2020-03-10T17:39:17Z", [0.0, 0.75, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [11430, "2020-03-10T17:10:43Z", [0.0, 0.65, 0.35, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2020-03-10T17:05:18Z", [0.0, 0.25, 0.45, 0.25, 0.05], ""]], "open_date": "2020-03-10T17:00:25Z", "close_date": "2020-05-13T06:59:25Z"}
