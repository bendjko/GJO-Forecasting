It really pains me to make this update because I can\u2019t imagine the fear and anger the people of Hong Kong must be experiencing right now.

On Thursday, the Electoral Affairs Commission (EAC), a puppet of the Communist Party announced that all candidates running for the Legislative Council would have to sign a declaration stating that they will \u2018uphold the Basic Law and pledge allegiance to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\u2019. A thinly veiled pledge of allegiance to the Chinese State which virtually bans anyone associated with the pro-democracy movement from standing in elections.

[1] The Party realized they were in danger of completely losing control of the primary stage and decided they would preempt any early celebrations by the pro-democracy movement.

[2] An editorial in the Hong Kong Free Press appeared to accept defeat in the election before a single vote had even been cast. \u2018[I]f we cannot immediately \u201cliberate\u201d the city, we can at least make the Chinese Communist Party pay the highest possible price for breaching an international treaty, breaking its promises and destroying Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy and freedoms,' Benedict Rogers, founder of Hong Kong Watch, wrote.

The pro-democracy movement is widely expected to win the September legislative election. I fully concur with this assessment. Local elections in November saw them gain a huge majority in district councils and there is no reason to suspect that the Security Law has done anything but bolster that support as the island city descends further in chaos. [1] The picture is far from that simple, though. The Communist Party has not and will not sit idly by why its authority is challenged. The passage of June\u2019s National Security Law gave a group of  party officials unilateral authority to do whatever they want in the name of protecting citizens. In practice, this will allow them to make laws in any area they see fit, including elections. [2] Realizing that their usual repression playbook has failed in Hong Kong, the party will probably not move to cancel the election outright, although one can never completely discount the possibility. [3] Rather, they will use the National Security Council to legislate in their favour and short-circuit the efforts of structurally weak legislature control by pro-democracy activists. After the election, we could see the NSC move to institute primary elections which would allow them control over the candidates up for election.The mainland government also controls the Chief Executive who will undoubtedly be working closely with security officials - reducing the significance, at least in the short-term, of a pro-Western coup. [4] This in my view is the most likely scenario: pro-democracy parties win but the Party stays in control - for now. Comments welcome. UPDATE: Just wanted to add a few more thoughts to this forecast. After re-reading, I think I gave the false impression that canceling the election or allowing the protestors to win were the only options. I think this was an unintentional oversight on my part and something I might have thought about but didn\u2019t develop that line of reasoning on paper. Of course there is a third option. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) could suppress pro-democracy candidates prior to the election, not even giving them a chance to appear on the ballot. This is in fact already happening. The Hong Kong Free Press reports that a group of young demonstrators calling themselves the \u2018local resistance camp\u2019 fear being barred from the September election. [5] The move comes just days after ex-Hong Kong lawmaker and key democratic primary organiser Au Nok-hin was pressured by Beijing into stepping down from his role in the pro-democracy movement. [6] So it is a tactic the CCP is using but I have to question how effective it will be by September 6. They are probably hoping that by cutting off the head of the snake, they can intimidate others or put enough in jail to crush any hope of a positive outcome. But when 2 million of your 7 million people take to the streets and 3 million to the polls, it is difficult to see how this will work without major manpower. [7] Just consider this map of 2019 local elections from the New York Times to see the scale of the problem officials face. [8] Certainly there is no question that the Party could brutally crush the ongoing dissent by military means but this would require a massive escalation, one Xi Jingping seems reluctant to make at this point. Troop movements in 2017, 2018 and 2019 have failed to produce such a result despite looming terror. [9] It could happen but history casts doubt on the possibility. Clearly police crackdowns have not been enough to disperse protests and should the military roll in, that creates a whole new set of problems. I don\u2019t think it is likely that the CCP would get away with simply faking the election results either. If they could have done that, they would have knocked all momentum out of the pro-democracy movement at the local elections in 2019 but they know they can\u2019t do that. The best they could muster came in 2016, when they invoked their powers under the transition agreement to re-interpret decisions by the Hong Kong High Court to ban pro-democracy advocates from participating in elections. [10] The judiciary in Hong Kong is fiercely independent and is the centre of the island\u2019s continued battle. [11] They would certainly have something to say about election meddling.
