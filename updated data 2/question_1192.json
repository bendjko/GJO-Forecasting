Voters may rebel against his Presidency at the ballot in favor of Le Pen who may tap the visceral emotions of voters more effectively. She has continued to push the narrative that Macron is out of touch with working peoples and fails to understand their plight which has resonated with many disillusioned voters. Despite only a narrow lead for National Rally today, they could outperform polling results similarly to Donald Trump in the US in 2016 as voters may be less likely to vocalize support for National Rally or have a last minute switch in hopes of altering the status quo. That being said, Macron's \"grand debate\" has improved his approval ratings with the French people, albeit gradually, and has shown an ability to change his viewpoints and listen. Also, he has the luxury of being the \"devil they know\" which could provide him with slightly more votes as the pro-European contingency is still robust and voter anxiety about National Rally is still a factor. https://www.politico.eu/2019-european-elections/france/\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-election-france/macrons-eu-election-flagbearer-targets-100-strong-alliance-with-kingmaker-role-idUSKCN1SI0BR\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/macron-wants-to-revive-europe-but-european-elections-could-kill-his-plans/2019/05/10/de3820bc-71b4-11e9-9eb4-0828f5389013_story.html"], [691, "2019-05-12T12:18:34Z", [0.36], ""], [6978, "2019-05-12T11:27:01Z", [0.33], ""], [26551, "2019-05-12T10:48:38Z", [0.46], "A few points: - Polls.

Chances that this mobilisation reaches the voters is still to be seen, the only reference as of today is Spain [5]. I was very skeptic about this pro-European reaction, and Spain is certainly no reflection of Europe, but I would be a small push to REM (not that all the pro-European vote will go to Macron, but even with a minimum proportion that would change the tie). - Punishment. Approval rates for Macron are still very low, at 30% average [6], even very recently after his response to the gilets jaunes protests [7] not showing any improvement, but actually split by social class [7]. \"A majority of the French now want the protests to stop, having initially sympathised with them.

In other voting systems e.g. First Past The Post, Single Transferable Vote, D'Hondt) supporters of small parties are likely to vote tactically if their preferred party is unlikely to win any seats. Looking at descriptions of what the parties stand for it appears to me that supports of the very small parties (that have not already made an alliance) are more likely to either vote for the party they prefer in the hope they get over the 5% threshold or switch to another small party. I would not expect many supporters of very small parties to switch to NR or NEM, as a vote to another small party is an effective protest.   The polls are very close between RN and REM. I can't see much evidence that the polls changed after the TV debates (maybe Le Pen moved RN up a little after the 24th Apr debate, but the remaining debates have the same people for RN and REM that took part in previous debates that did not move the polls). The range of support for both RN and REM has only moved between very small bands. The graphs show slight declines for both parties and if a trend was plotted one could predict that RN would be ahead of REM by about 15th May (but all trends depend on where you start from).

Turnout in elections in France has been on a long term decline, and the 2017 Parliamentary elections were the worst for turnout on record. Presidential elections get the highest turnout, at roughly 70ish%, but I am not expecting these elections to be massively popular in France, so only the most enthusiastic voter will come out. Many of these will have been involved in the yellow vest protests as that is potentially a big signal that they are interested in politics, or it could just be that French people tend to like rioting more than others. The base rate of who usually wins these elections isn't going to be terribly useful given that En March is a new party and NR is still a relatively new force in France, but I'm holding true in that we are in weird times and that EU elections don't get a high turnout in France. The polling does seem to be quite tight, but then as we know from the last few years there should always be healthy scepticism around polling, particularly in this instance as I am not familiar with how reliable the french polling companies are/how reliable it is in France. ( https://pollofpolls.eu/FR/63/ep2019-in-france ) My gut is that the weirdness of the current situation will mean that NR does win by a very small amount, but I will keep looking into the polling and adjust if people have seen something I haven't.
