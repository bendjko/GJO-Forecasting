That leaves Canadian mining company Crystallex International claim on Citgo assets as a major reason for Citgo to use bankruptcy protection.

Guaido et al recently hired a prominent debt lawyer to help restructure the country\u2019s more than $150 billion debt burden, suggesting it could take a tough approach to dealing with investors holding defaulted bonds. As per Reuters, the most immediate task for a potential restructuring is protecting Citgo. The $71M payment the opposition made on bonds backed was backed by shares in Citgo, but other creditors could still try to seize the company to collect on unpaid debt. https://www.wsj.com/articles/venezuelan-opposition-weighs-u-s-help-on-citgo-backed-bond-11556141102"], [767, "2019-06-03T23:05:19Z", [0.1], ""], [691, "2019-06-03T11:55:06Z", [0.1], ""], [172, "2019-06-02T12:18:04Z", [0.05], ""], [69257, "2019-06-01T12:58:12Z", [0.15], ""], [23006, "2019-06-01T00:56:10Z", [0.12], ""], [61938, "2019-05-29T18:36:26Z", [0.12], ""], [62808, "2019-05-28T22:33:15Z", [1.0], ""], [50491, "2019-05-28T20:58:49Z", [0.35], ""], [128, "2019-05-28T14:00:10Z", [0.1], ""], [427, "2019-05-28T00:56:59Z", [0.1], ""], [691, "2019-05-27T11:46:32Z", [0.1], ""], [172, "2019-05-26T16:43:36Z", [0.05], ""], [13377, "2019-05-26T08:39:56Z", [0.11], ""], [691, "2019-05-25T12:04:54Z", [0.11], ""], [1333, "2019-05-24T17:56:26Z", [0.12], ""], [74067, "2019-05-22T20:41:47Z", [0.35], ""], [61938, "2019-05-22T19:22:06Z", [0.12], ""], [159, "2019-05-21T14:50:12Z", [0.01], ""], [691, "2019-05-21T14:44:41Z", [0.12], ""], [73877, "2019-05-21T12:14:14Z", [0.13], ""], [37379, "2019-05-21T02:13:24Z", [0.1], ""], [69317, "2019-05-20T15:17:14Z", [0.75], ""], [128, "2019-05-20T15:07:07Z", [0.12], ""], [172, "2019-05-19T14:42:16Z", [0.05], ""], [69034, "2019-05-19T13:33:14Z", [0.5], ""], [73701, "2019-05-19T12:51:37Z", [1.0], ""], [70711, "2019-05-18T18:11:29Z", [0.7], ""], [70530, "2019-05-18T06:26:14Z", [0.65], ""], [62808, "2019-05-17T23:51:02Z", [1.0], ""], [691, "2019-05-17T20:08:19Z", [0.12], ""], [1333, "2019-05-17T19:03:48Z", [0.13], ""], [62808, "2019-05-15T21:53:09Z", [0.96], ""], [172, "2019-05-15T01:46:49Z", [0.05], ""], [73202, "2019-05-14T16:19:28Z", [0.0], ""], [68952, "2019-05-13T22:34:37Z", [0.45], ""], [62438, "2019-05-11T09:26:34Z", [0.13], ""], [12789, "2019-05-10T19:45:41Z", [0.4], "Good chance, but maybe a bit early in the year."], [172, "2019-05-09T00:42:13Z", [0.05], ""], [61938, "2019-05-08T20:03:36Z", [0.15], ""], [73008, "2019-05-07T11:56:07Z", [0.15], ""], [691, "2019-05-06T12:23:21Z", [0.12], ""], [60928, "2019-05-04T16:31:21Z", [0.25], ""], [1333, "2019-05-03T21:11:56Z", [0.14], ""], [691, "2019-05-03T19:31:53Z", [0.15], ""], [128, "2019-05-01T13:41:06Z", [0.14], ""], [21884, "2019-04-30T09:31:12Z", [0.1], ""], [172, "2019-04-30T00:57:13Z", [0.05], ""], [72713, "2019-04-29T13:27:54Z", [0.43], ""], [61877, "2019-04-29T12:34:29Z", [0.3], ""], [37379, "2019-04-28T09:18:53Z", [0.15], ""], [691, "2019-04-27T21:06:22Z", [0.14], ""], [13377, "2019-04-27T09:01:13Z", [0.14], ""], [593, "2019-04-27T08:22:36Z", [0.35], ""], [49359, "2019-04-26T22:10:58Z", [0.19], ""], [62808, "2019-04-26T20:45:40Z", [0.96], ""], [1333, "2019-04-25T14:43:05Z", [0.15], "Venezuelan crude oil production falls to lowest level since January 2003\nIn March 2019, Venezuela's crude oil production (excluding condensate) averaged 840,000 barrels per day (b/d), down from 1.1 million b/d in February, according to estimates in the U.S. Energy Information Administration's (EIA) April 2019 Short-Term Energy Outlook.

The subsidiary is severable from the group and able to stand on its own or subcontract certain functions previously provided by the parent. The parent's strategy with respect to the subsidiary is clear and, in particular, the parent has a compelling economic incentive to preserve the subsidiary's credit strength; and it is unlikely that the subsidiary will be drawn into bankruptcy proceedings at the group level that would lead to a default on the subsidiary's obligations. Additionally, CITGO holds itself out as a separate entity and maintains arm's-length relationships with its affiliates; it doesn't commingle its funds, other assets, and cash flows with those of any other entity; it maintains its own records, books of account, financial statements, and other corporate documents separate from those of any other company; and it pays its own liabilities out of its own funds and observes all corporate formalities. In situations where the group credit profile is in the 'CCC' category (as is the case with PDVSA), the issuer credit rating on an insulated subsidiary will be no lower than 'B-'.  Additionally, when the 2015 CITGO Holdings bond was issued, covenants were put in place which effectively limit the likelihood that CITGO will 1. be able to incur significant additional debt and 2. dividend the proceeds of any such incremental debt to PDVSA. Beyond this, there exist covenants that impact the ability of CITGO to raise additional debt at both the CITGO Petroleum and CITGO Holding levels. CITGO Petroleum covenants include - financial covenant of debt to capitalization of 60%, restricted payments test of debt to capitalization of 55% and minimum liquidity of $500 million and any restricted payments cannot exceed 100% of net income, and an additional pari passu debt limited to $1 billion in aggregate, as well as baskets for a project finance of $250 million inventory financing of $300 million. CITGO Holding covenants include - financial covenant of debt to capitalization of 75%, restricted payments test that CITGO Holding leverage must be less than 2x plus 18 months of debt service on all debt must be reserved, and that the additional CITGO Petroleum indebtedness listed above of up to $1 billion can only be more than $500 million if CITGO Holding's leverage is less than 1.5x. With regard to PDVSA collateralizing loans from Rosneft with its CITGO equity, PDVSA is domiciled in Venezuela but the CITGO entities are U.S. companies, subject to U.S. law. Rosneft, which is majority owned by Russia, is currently the subject of financial sanctions imposed by the U.S. in 2014 following Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea. Under U.S. law, these sanctions prevent Rosneft from gaining control of U.S. assets. CITGO represents the most significant offshore assets of PDVSA. Given that CITGO will likely not be included in the bankruptcy of PDVSA should it occur, it is more likely that PDSVA would seek a buyer for the company as a means to receive as much value as possible.
