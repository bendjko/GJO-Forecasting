The emergence of GCC-Israel relations in a changing Middle East - Brookings Institution\nhttps://www.brookings.edu/research/the-emergence-of-gcc-israel-relations-in-a-changing-middle-east/\nWed, 28 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT > In contrast, the UAE views Israel as a formidable regional power that shares these views and is willing to act forcibly to counter regional adversaries. A formal alliance with Israel, therefore, makes strategic sense. So, while the normalization agreements were billed by the Trump administration, which brokered them, as peace accords, they were clearly driven by coalition-building rather than peacebuilding. > Moreover, amid the threat posed by the spread of popular uprisings in the region, the Gulf states have become eager purchasers of sophisticated surveillance technology in order to more effectively police their populations.[13] For its part, Israel has been a willing purveyor of this technology with few reservations for possible human rights abuse.[14] This has given a corollary benefit to their relationship and offered new commercial pathways that have dovetailed with the UAE\u2019s own ambitions of becoming a regional technology and innovation hub. Moreover, since normalization, the sides have announced a number of areas of commercial cooperation, including plans for an oil pipeline running from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean.[15] But most significant of all, the Saudi-UAE axis views a closer relationship with Israel as an indirect means of preserving its partnership with Washington. This motivation is largely shared across the GCC because of the importance of the decades-old American-backed security architecture in the region. However, in recent years the Gulf states have had ample reason for concern about America\u2019s long-term commitment. In particular, lengthy and costly American wars have generated fatigue at home with continued military engagement in the Middle East. And while energy security was once the bonding agent of the U.S.-Gulf alliance, a resurgence in American energy production over the past decade has created the perception of it coming unglued. As a result of these and other factors, successive U.S. administrations have signaled a desire to modify, and perhaps reduce, America\u2019s posture and presence in the region\u2014a sentiment that may only deepen as a result of the economic costs of the COVID-19 pandemic.[16] For the Gulf states, however, which are highly anxious about the regional outlook, retaining America\u2019s commitment to their security is paramount.[17]  Moreover, Israel and the Gulf axis have found common cause in trying to steer America\u2019s Middle East policy in a mutually beneficial direction.[22] In particular, the two sides viewed the Obama administration\u2019s pursuit of a nuclear agreement with Iran, and subsequently an end to Iranian isolation, as troubling and dangerous. Finding ways to counter the Obama administration\u2019s agenda became an opportunity for the two sides to work together without U.S. involvement\u2014a significant step in the development of this relationship\u2014and the eventual basis for working with the incoming Trump administration in 2017.[23]  In fact, an early test to the resilience of these normalization agreements came in April and May 2021, when widespread Palestinian protests in Jerusalem during the holy month of Ramadan were violently dispersed by Israeli security forces, including harrowing raids on the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound\u2014one of Islam\u2019s most sacred sites\u2014during the holiest month of the year, in which Israeli forces launched stun grenades and tear gas into the mosque itself. The subsequent bombing of the Gaza Strip by Israel, in which dozens of children were killed, and communal violence between Jews and Arabs in Israeli cities added to the pressure. While the events were unlikely to lead to backtracking on a long-term strategic decision like normalization, they clearly made the normalizing states uncomfortable, produced a backlash from within their societies, and demonstrated that without an end to Palestinian subjugation such uprisings will reoccur and continue to test the Gulf-Israel relationship.[30] Ted Cruz blocks bill advancing Israel-Arab normalization in spat over language - The Times of Israel\nhttps://www.timesofisrael.com/ted-cruz-blocks-bill-advancing-israel-arab-normalization-in-spat-over-language/\nThu, 29 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT Creditors cancel $14 billion of Sudan\u2019s debt after reforms, Israel normalization - The Times of Israel\nhttps://www.timesofisrael.com/creditors-cancel-14-billion-of-sudans-debt-after-reforms-israel-normalization/\nSat, 17 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT Israeli cyber authority opposes police facial recognition cameras - Haaretz\nhttps://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-top-israeli-cyber-authority-opposes-police-plan-to-install-face-recognition-cameras-1.10073304\nTue, 03 Aug 2021 03:01:00 GMT Will Bennett allow US to roll back recognition of Israel's capital and redivide Jerusalem? - JNS.org\nhttps://www.jns.org/opinion/will-bennett-allow-us-to-rollback-recognition-of-israels-capital-and-redivide-jerusalem/\nThu, 15 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT Police want facial recognition systems installed across Israel - Haaretz\nhttps://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-despite-concerns-police-want-facial-recognition-systems-installed-across-isreal-1.9988314\nSat, 10 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT Facial recognition surveillance worldwide: Mexico steps forward, Israel and EU step back and the US to the side - Biometric Update\nhttps://www.biometricupdate.com/202108/facial-recognition-surveillance-worldwide-mexico-steps-forward-israel-and-eu-step-back-and-the-us-to-the-side\nFri, 06 Aug 2021 19:43:39 GMT"], [101364, "2021-08-07T15:36:47Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [94872, "2021-08-07T05:52:00Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [67403, "2021-08-05T10:57:28Z", [0.02, 0.02, 0.03, 0.03, 0.9], "a war with iran may change things "], [87897, "2021-08-04T23:27:23Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [31275, "2021-08-03T19:47:13Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [67403, "2021-08-03T09:57:39Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [95992, "2021-08-01T01:51:47Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [87897, "2021-07-31T22:43:42Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [89038, "2021-07-30T21:42:08Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [691, "2021-07-30T16:21:28Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [100273, "2021-07-29T22:14:32Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.8], ""], [62808, "2021-07-29T21:15:19Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [55987, "2021-07-29T15:10:58Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [1333, "2021-07-29T13:27:15Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [100653, "2021-07-26T09:09:14Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [102043, "2021-07-26T07:02:48Z", [0.98, 0.02, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "Comment deleted on Jul 26, 2021 07:03AM UTC"], [52131, "2021-07-23T14:40:49Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [80475, "2021-07-21T15:08:47Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "Unless there's some other provocation, this should end at \"6 or more\""], [93350, "2021-07-20T06:38:00Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "Israel is in the middle of a (albeit fragile) ceasefire with Hamas.
