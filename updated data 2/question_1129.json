Still, if we assume that Uber has driven \"millions of miles\"[3] to be between 2 and 10 with a skew toward the lower end and we add in numbers from other companies, we have a highly fragile fatality rate of 1 fatality per 20 million miles (this squares somewhat well with non-autonomous numbers; see below).\n- I estimate about 10m miles to be driven during the period in question (based on Waymo numbers, growth rates, and California numbers for Cruise).\n- Naive fatality estimate (non-autonomous): 10m miles / (1.25 fatalities / 10m miles) = 1.25 fatalities\n- FWIW, Tesla autopilot seems to be involved in about 8x fewer crashes per mile than regular cars. [4] Assuming that the L3 - L5 is comparable, this would push down the estimate significantly, and may partly explain the lower rate calculated above. On the other hand, estimates by @3V_Money seem to suggest that accident rates are higher actually.\n- Based on this, a median between 0.5 and 1.25 fatalities seems about right. I'd expect variance to be quite high, given the low numbers involved. Based on the Uber fallout one would expect the operations of any company involved in any accident to be heavily curtailed. Since Waymo and Cruise are the main companies involved, three or four accidents seem highly unlikely. One would also expect safety to improve all else equal. Based on this I plugged in some rough numbers that seem right.

This should ultimately be referencing specific levels of autonomy (L0-L5). For sake of answering I will assume this is referring to L3-L5 levels of autonomy (i.e. Waymo, Cruze, etc.). While there is limited information about the overall number of miles traveled by L3+ vehicles I'll default to self reported data from Waymo & Cruze (The primary two in operation through 2019). # of accident reports involving autonomous vehicles in California in 2018: 73\n# of Miles driven by Waymo + Cruise (By far the two leaders) in California in 2018: ~1.65 million miles\nResultant accident rate assuming all 73 accident reports occur while operating in an L3+ mode: ~4,400/100 million miles. I'm finding it difficult at the moment to find an accurate rate of accidents/100million miles in the US (generalized,  not just fatalities) to draw a general rate dichotomy as the pool to draw from fatality wise is so narrow (only one example), but the best I can find implies the number is around 600/100 million. This makes the rate of accidents for L3+ thus far > 7 times the national average. Assuming a linear correlation to % of accidents that should result in a fatality I end up with an assumed average of 8.7 per 100 million miles driven. (Could be a mistake here but this seems roughly accurate). Now assuming Waymo & Cruise exhibit linear growth in their total mileage accumulation throughout 2019 (dangerous assumption) I'll assume an average of ~ 35,000 autonomous miles per day driven, totaling around 13 million miles in 2019. \nScaled for comparison the average rate should be roughly 1.13 fatal accidents per 13 million miles driven. Now making a few more brash assumptions, lets assume a standard deviation from this value of a fairly wide 0.5 given the hopeful accuracy of assumptions.
