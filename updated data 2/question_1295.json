Apparently [1] (which is repeated in many other Chinese news) from yesterday it has been circulating some rumors that the first few Model 3 will be delivered as a Christmas present (which would indicate a delivery in the next few days). The rumors are derived from some Christmas image by Tesla. Yet this is contrasted with the official estimates of deliveries starting at the beginning of January. The original Chinese text in source [1] reads \"\u4ece\u56fe\u7247\u4e2d\u53ef\u4ee5\u731c\u6d4b\uff0c\u7279\u65af\u62c9\u4f3c\u4e4e\u628a\u56fd\u4ea7Model 3\u7684\u4ea4\u4ed8\u5f53\u6210\u5723\u8bde\u8282\u793c\u7269\u3002\u800c\u5728\u7279\u65af\u62c9\u5b98\u7f51\u4e0a\uff0c\u56fd\u4ea7\u7279\u65af\u62c9Model 3\u7684\u4ea4\u4ed8\u65e5\u671f\u6807\u6ce8\u4e3a\u201c2020\u5e74\u7b2c\u4e00\u5b63\u5ea6\u201d\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7279\u65af\u62c9\u5728\u6d77\u5916\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u4e0a\u7684\u914d\u56fe\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63a8\u6d4b\u8fd9\u6b3e\u8f66\u5f88\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u4e8e2020\u5e741\u6708\u521d\u4ea4\u4ed8\" which we can translate \"From the picture we guess that the nationally produced Model 3 will be delivered as a Christmas present. But in the official Tesla webpage, the nationally produced Model 3 it is expected to be delivered in the first quarter of 2020, which if combined with what it is said by foreign social media by Tesla (the image above), will let us get to the conclusion that maybe it will be delivered by the beginning of January\". So basically in the Chinese news they are averaging the 2020 Q1 official delivery expectation date with the idea of the first few deliveries as a Christmas gift.

More recent news talk either of deliveries expected to happen by the end of the standard year (\"\u56fd\u4ea7Model 3\u9884\u8ba1\u5e74\u4f4e\u5f00\u59cb\u4ea4\u4ed8\", i.e. \"the delivery of the locally produced model 3 is expected to begin by the end of the year\") [2] or before the Chinese new year. Besides we all have seen all these pictures of trucks going outside of Gigafactory 3 with model 3's. To make things more complicated: apparently, it I understood correctly, there has been some official ceremony by Tesla in Beijing for announcing that you can go to a few Tesla centers and try the locally produced Model 3 [3] (five shops in Beijing, a total of 17 shops nation-wide). Apparently it was announced too: \"don't panic, it will be on the streets by the end of the year\" (the \"don't panic\" is a creative translation by me) [4].  In short, it is imminent. But we have a problem whether the definition of imminent falls within the time frame of the question. There is merely a week for the end of 2019, which is sort of tight. The other symbolic date is Chinese new year (January 25th), which is however a problematic date for delivery owing to the 10-15 days of vacations around it and that many clients will not be in their standard residences but in their hometowns. Now, the first deliveries will be probably symbolic, which means that they need to decide on a date. Christmas eve or Chrismas day (today and tomorrow) are not necessarily likely to be chosen, as it does not emotionally resonate within China. End of the year or first day of the year could also be good choices. For Chinese new year, it should better happen at least one week before and there is no clear symbolic date then. Outside view 1: delivery will happen at a random day between today and January 21, which gives a 25% that it happens within the end of the question. Outside view 2: delivery will happen at a significant date, with the highest probabilities for 31st December / 1st January and lower probability for 25th December / 25th of January. I would say that 31st December seems the best choice from many points of views (besides 1st of January is a holiday), but there's no clear answer in sight. I could assign a 15% for December 25, 50% for December 31, giving a 65%. This gives me an averaged 40% probability, which I simply average again with my previous 80% estimation, to get a 60%. A bit too simple, but well.

According to [2], Gigafactory 3 can already produce 1000 vehicles per week. According to [3], trucks loaded with Model 3's have been spotted in their way to Tesla shops or maybe for delivery to customers (it shows some pics).
