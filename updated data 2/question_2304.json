(Probably only thing that could have been better would be Real and Villareal being switched) On the one side of the draw we have: Man City vs Atletico: Atleti can always be a bit of a wild card with Simone's physical style of play, but over 2 legs you would imagine the quality of Pep's City should win out pretty handedly going up against the winner of: Chelsea vs Real Madrid: This one is a bit of a toss up, Tuchel's Chelsea are a pragmatic and capable team (as can be seen by last year's championship) but not quite up the the standard of City, Bayern or Liverpool. Ancelotti's Real are still a very good team, but are going through a transition as their stars start to age. They aren't the galacticos 2.0 iteration of the team any more, but are still capable. I think City is pretty heavily favorite to come out of this side, with Real or Chelsea having a puncher chance. Because of this I expect a English team to come out of this side. On the other side of the bracket we have: Bayern vs Villareal: No offense to Emery's Villareal, but I think Bayern breezes through this tie. Maybe it is a bit tainted by my affinity for Bayern, but I don't see the 7th place team in La Liga even making it close if Nagelsmann has Bayern firing at even close to full cylinders. Taking on the winner of: Liverpool vs Benfica: Again, no offense meant to Verissimo's Benfica but I was very surprised they were able to beat Ajax. Klopp's Liverpool should certainly outclass them over 2 legs This side is much harder to decide who will ultimately come out on top. Bayern vs Liverpool will be a tie for the ages with both sides being very special sides. Between injuries between now and then, form on the day, and the tactical chess match between Klopp and Nagelsmann there is too much to call it anything else but a coin toss. From looking at the 2 sides of the bracket it looks almost certain England will come out City's side of the bracket, with the other side having a 50/50 chance (Liverpool or Bayern) with the one game final being a toss up between any of those 3 teams.
