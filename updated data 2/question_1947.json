The question starts with the premise that the responding company has said that it has \"canceled or suspended most or all trips to the following regions or countries,\" of which one option is \"all international travel.\"  Some responding companies had only cancelled \"most\" and not \"all\" trips.  So the question in context may be, for some, when will your policy against \"most\" international travel change -- not \"when will you resume any international travel whatsoever\"?  Of course, the language \"all\" international travel makes this question potentially confusing, since it might suggest, to some, that they need to resume \"all\" international travel to answer yes (though I am not saying this would be a majority interpretation).  And the multiple choice options are really designed to push respondents to say \"no\" unless they really have an actual, concrete plan.  There are three options for non-yes responses, including \"no definite plans,\" \"do not plan,\" and \"not sure.\"  As others have noted, the universe of respondents change as some companies exit the pool, having developed concrete plans in earlier months, leaving a smaller and qualitatively different pool of respondents. So where does that leave us?  In May, of the respondents who said they had suspended most or all international travel, 13% had a concrete plan to resume by mid-August.  I suspect concrete plans actually lag progress with vaccinations -- it is only after vaccinations are widespread among the company's personnel that might travel that a concrete plan will be made.  So I would expect a higher percentage in June than in May, from this largely US based group, and more in July once the three month window clearly extends beyond labor day.  The dwindling pool of companies answering this question does not necessarily mean one never reaches 20%; you could exceed 20% every time this poll is again given.  At some point, when the last holdout gives up, it will be 100% in that month.  The survey question we are interpreting is such a mess, and with the universe of survey respondents changing, I am of course not that confident in my prediction, which I have to admit, it based on a sense there will be a small surge, in one of the next three months, as opposed to the long period of the pandemic when there was a very broad shutdown in travel.\n"], [80790, "2021-06-05T16:25:04Z", [0.77], "Early May survey has rate at 13pc.

I think the most troubling aspect of the most recent release is the n of 314-486 for resumption of travel questions. This is a really small pool from the GBTA's 9k members or 16k people that this was sent to, and the member roster is only available to members of the org anyway so it\u2019s hard to say who's responding here. It seems like the biggest chunks of respondents are from the US and Europe going by the first chart, but that's still a very broad description that isn't super helpful. I know very little about who I'm trying to forecast for, other than that they're companies who did international travel who are mostly in Europe and the US. Most of my analysis is pretty high level and non-specific.  The percentage planning to resume in 1-3 months went from 7% to 8% to 10% in February/March/April of this year, so it\u2019s been increasing at a slow pace recently. If it goes up 2% each month it would peak at 18%. Another thing to consider is that in the March survey more than half of respondents with employees not in the office plan to have them return with 6 months (13% in 1-3 and 38% in 4-6), so a lot of COVID easing plans are scheduled for 4-6 months from March, or 1-3 months from June. They're completely different questions so the magnitudes will be different, but there's fair reason to think more respondents should have 1-3 month plans in the next few months before the question ends.  As for wider context, on one hand vaccines will ease travel, both making the traveler safer and the destination safer, but there's the question of variants as well, their influence on governments' travel guidance, their susceptibility to vaccines, and their level of spread. Most variants don't appear to spread much in the US, and vaccines protect against severe cases currently. More countries in the West have been getting their vaccine distributions more figured out in the past month or so after early logistical hiccups and blood clot worries and what not. The overall COVID climate in the West will probably continue slowly improving, with vaccines getting distributed but staying constrained by variant fears and differences across countries. The other consideration is companies developing plans (for 1-3 months) versus playing it by ear, which will probably be heavily dependent on government guidance. Governments in general tend to be conservative, so we're probably not going to have many countries saying that international travel is safe, and thus fewer companies making definite plans. There\u2019s also the uncertainty around where these respondents travel to, even if they\u2019re Western-based. According to Amex the most popular destinations for US companies are London, Toronto, Mexico City, Cancun, Shanghai, Paris, Tokyo, Sao Paolo, Montreal, and Amsterdam (https://www.amexglobalbusinesstravel.com/de/the-atlas/international-business-travel-stats-2014/ ). Of those destinations, London and kinda Amsterdam are the only ones currently doing well with vaccine rollouts, so recommendations against travel will likely remain in place for most relevant destinations for the next several months, so little reason to expect an acceleration in % with plans in response to travel guidance changes. Recent trends say gaining ~8 percentage points with a very wide confidence interval, and inside view info mostly around vaccine rollouts raises that maybe 30% to just over 10 percentage points (peaking at ~20%). SO could very easily go either way, will see how future polls look and how the global COVID situation evolves."], [100750, "2021-04-22T15:03:40Z", [0.25], "Companies will be more conservative than individuls in resuming International Travel"], [57249, "2021-04-22T13:28:10Z", [0.33], ""], [100731, "2021-04-22T13:19:33Z", [0.8], "20% isn't much"], [100724, "2021-04-22T11:21:46Z", [0.79], "Face to face meetings are still important for most sales related trips.
