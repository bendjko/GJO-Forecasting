This doesn't seem much, considering how many new titles are newly published each year. Large book fairs are still cancelled due to the pandemic, so the diversity of titles will be reduced, smaller publishers, newcomer authors and less well-established writers will struggle, and different time-consuming \"cultural/entertainment\" occupations such as streaming tv (Netflix, Disney+, movies,...) will dent into people's time devoted for reading. Libraries will increasingly digitize their offer and DRM, digital licenses and ebook lending or shopping are probably the future of book lending, even from the average readers' perspective. Flat fee access to a variety of titles through the likes of amazon kindle will increasingly put pressure on the print book market.\nMy conclusion is that, while people may spend one more year with above-average hours reading all sorts of creative works, it will hardly translate into more than, say, 725mn copies in printed books. The books you really want to own as a hardcopy are probably those which are either important for educational purpose and value, which you have to revisit frequently, those which - in time of crisis - offer some mental help or solace, and those books which offer an in-depth analysis of the respective crisis or, in turbulent times in general, offer some interesting perspective on or contribute to the large topic of a general debate.\nTitles will be preferably sold in hard copy about people who are either idolized (the Obamas' best sellers) or demonized (the Trump re-election campaign and presidency; trying to sell idolization books to Trump supporters is not promising, because they hardly read as much. I think Trump campaigners understood that this would be as successful as selling Trump T-bone steaks to vegetarians...), or working off the justice/law enforcement brutality problem and BLM topic in the public debate by opinion leaders. This has been done in 2020, and 2020 was a pretty exceptional year in this respect (scandals...) which filled a gap.\nI don't expect this to repeat in 2021 to the same extent. Many on the long list of publications will end up in the ebook market. /\"Supply\" of new titles will abate for the same reasons mentioned above. /Print books aren't cheap, and while economic stimulus money was an extra budget for many average readers that enabled them to afford extra print books more easily in 2020 and the first half of 2021, some of the payments will henceforth be bound to a forced return to the labor market (as enforced in some states already), so that a significant chunk of readers will either lack a budget to continue with their reading habits, or lack the time for actual reading. Purchase power doesn't seem to be an issue at the moment, but looking back at historic figures, it was the second and particularly the third year of the \"Great Recession\" 2009/2010 in which print book sales started their decline for real, probably also due to a more pronounced financial crisis on the individual level, and due to returning inflation in other goods of daily importance. /I also doubt the book market will expand beyond its most recent peak of 780mn copies in 2008 for all the reasons mentioned above (time and financial budget, topics of general interest, digital trends)"], [100859, "2021-05-12T23:45:11Z", [0.1], "The pandemic clearly affected book sales, and it should have a reduced effect this year, as vaccine rollout gradually returns normalcy to the U.S.  Book sales have shown natural growth hovering around 2% per year, which, combined with sales from early this year, might overcome 2020, but I have my doubts.

Further, NPD statistics seem to have been led by juvenile fiction, juvenile non-fiction, and adult non-fiction in real terms. However, the growth in adult categories of books was much smaller than juvenile categories in percentage terms. Extrapolating the overall intent of many book purchases seems to be to provide juveniles with something to occupy their time when no longer in school in person and to provide an outlet for adults to better themselves during the pandemic outside of work. If in-person work and school returns across the US in 2021 the overall sales of juvenile books and adult non-fiction will probably not be as robust as in 2020. This does not look likely broadly across the US until the fall. That means three quarters which will probably robust sales of print books at a minimum, which was also the case in 2020 as only three quarters saw strong print book sales in 2020. Therefore, book sales will probably continue to be strong, as was seen in the first quarter of 2021 (source 2).

While the strong sales number was worth a point, Q1 2021 was very similar to Q4 of 2020 from a lifestyle perspective. The problem is that any misstep in the numbers means we're off-track for this. If Q2 drops exactly to 182M books sold, before things completely started reopening, then that signals a lot of trouble for Q3 and Q4.

To me, the cookbooks are going to have been a one-time purchase for most people as they realize that they're not actually using them as often as they'd thought. Self-help might be a more sustainable category, but was probably also used to cope with the crisis and people are looking past this with the prevalence of vaccines. The issue with schooling from home is now its unpopularity. Parents have come to expect the daycare-like quality of the current school system and it would be disastrous if we did not open most school districts for in-person schooling come Fall 2021. Kids will be outdoors and among friends more often = less reading and book purchasing. I'm not sure if we will drop to 2019 levels of books again. We'll probably buoy above this by a bit because the first past of this year was similar to most of 2020. I'm just incredibly skeptical that any of those cited reasons are continuous and going to keep things at where they were last year.
