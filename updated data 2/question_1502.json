He was seeking the backing of lawmakers for a reform of the EU\u2019s bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).

You could say it all began on the 10th of April when he publicly accused opposition leaders Matteo Salvini and Giorgia Meloni of being liars. These accusations were met with responses comparing Conte's actions with that of a regime. However criticism of the Prime Minister is focused on a series of aspects, the most important being the economical policies adopted by the government to combat the effects of COVID-19. It has been approximately a month since most business in Italy had to close. The vast majority of these businesses were not prepared for this long of a closure and are now facing serious financial difficulties. Along with this unemployment rose to 11.6% in April from 9.8% at the end of 2019. Most of the economical tactics employed by Conte have been ineffective, they usually consisted of going on live TV and promising Italian citizens sums of money which never arrived. Conte also stated that Italy did not need to resort to the use of the European Stability Mechanism and then one week later an agreement was reached with the EU that allowed for the possibility of the ESM to be used. Now this was all done without taking into consideration what was thought of the ESM in Parliament, Conte was heavily criticized for not considering what opposition leaders had to say and above all what his own party had to say. Yes, Conte's very own political party was unsure of what to do regarding the ESM. Along with these mishaps are a serious of smaller actions which I won't describe.\nNow, given this context, I believe that if an election will be held it will be held on the grounds that Conte was unable to successfully protect the Italian economy. However, the coalition of left wing parties holds the majority and I see it unlikely that they will be willing to risk going to the polls. If the coalition is to break it will be precisely because of this economic tension within the government. It also has to be said that the leaders of the main EU countries see Conte's exit as Prime Minister as a threat. I believe that Italian citizens are just now starting to realize how inefficient the EU is and how one-sided it has become. This new vision, which will most likely be adopted by the next Prime Minister, threaten the stability of the EU as Italy is a large contributor of funds. Conte would be pressured by Macron and Merkel to stay because they fear that someone like Matteo Salvini would succeed him.

M5S has performed worse in the Regional elections than its polling numbers suggested it would and it is being reported that M5S is having trouble with keeping     its MPs in line. A fractured M5S in the next few months could lead to the government falling. The government has a majority of 30 so if 16 MPs switched  away from the government presumably it would fall. The government coalition contains several very small parties that by themselves could not trigger an election by withdrawing from the government so a GE could only be triggered by the PD or M5S calling one or breaking up. If a GE occurred tomorrow the M5S would lose many seats and the PD would probably lose seats, so if a change to the PM does occur its likely to be due to the coalition deciding to change PM or the M5S breaking up. If the coalition tries to change the PM its likely that the coalition would break up.
