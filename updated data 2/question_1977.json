The small spike of a couple of weeks ago appears to have not been as bad as initially projected as vaccination rates continue to increase.  The pleasant weather of the past couple of weeks for most of the county probably contributed to the decline as well.  As a lagging indicator, probably see a low death count from COVID next week.
