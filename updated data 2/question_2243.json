North Korea said it launched a Hwasong-17 missile, its longest-range developmental ICBM, last Thursday in its biggest weapons test in years. Its state media called the launch \u201ca historical event\u201d and released a stylized Hollywood-style video showing leader Kim Jong Un, in sunglasses and leather jacket, supervising the launch. But South Korea\u2019s Defense Ministry said Tuesday it has determined that what North Korea fired wasn\u2019t a Hwasong-17 but a Hwasong-15, another ICBM that it successfully tested in 2017. Both missiles are potentially capable of reaching the U.S. mainland. But analysts say the Hwasong-17 has a longer potential range and its huge size suggests that it\u2019s designed to carry multiple nuclear warheads to defeat missile defense systems. Believed to be about 25 meters (82 feet) long, the Hwasong-17 is, by some estimates, the world\u2019s biggest road-mobile ballistic missile system. The Defense Ministry said it told a parliamentary committee that details of Thursday\u2019s launch -- such as the missile\u2019s speed, combustion and stage separation -- were similar to those of the Hwasong-15, not the Hwasong-17. The ministry report to the committee also suggested that the North Korean video wasn\u2019t shot on the actual launch date, citing an analysis of Kim\u2019s shadow and weather conditions seen in the video.\"\nhttps://apnews.com/article/business-seoul-south-korea-north-korea-47a7e85c51102bc023db53c6c093186d \"[...] \nRange\n    8,500 \u2013 13,000 km \nStatus\n    Operational\nIn service\n    2017\"\nhttps://missilethreat.csis.org/missile/hwasong-15-kn-22/"], [691, "2022-03-29T17:07:44Z", [1.0], ""], [104018, "2022-03-27T19:38:36Z", [1.0], ""], [103878, "2022-03-27T14:29:46Z", [1.0], ""], [105528, "2022-03-27T13:51:23Z", [1.0], ""], [104101, "2022-03-27T10:14:40Z", [0.99], ""], [100805, "2022-03-27T06:59:55Z", [1.0], ""], [1646, "2022-03-27T00:56:06Z", [1.0], ""], [64041, "2022-03-26T11:26:26Z", [1.0], "Still waiting on CSIS to update their records and resolve the question.

There's going to be a very big celebration. And with such celebrations come displays of military might. \"The Politcal Bureau of the Party Central Committee... came to a conclusion that it must go over to practical actions to consolidate more reliably and more precisely our physical strength for defending the dignity of our state and its national rights and interests. The meeting reconfirmed the tasks of defence policy to strengthen and develop without delay more powerful physical means to definitely overpower the daily intensifying hostile moves of the United States. It instructed the field concerned... to rapidly examine the issue on resuming all actions which had been temporarily suspended. The decision adopted at the meeting is a timely and just measure to reliably guarantee the existence of our state and its sovereignty....\" \"our physical strength\": Nuclear weapons.\n\"more reliably\": Let's have fewer \"accidents,\" please.\n\"more precisely\": Let's continue miniaturizing warheads to fit in smaller nose cones, to allow optimizing nose cone design for better missile targeting.

I think it's pretty clear we can expect an ICBM to be tested in this big anniversary year. And when there is an accident, it's usually after a missile has left the ground. Later note: Day of the Sun = Kim Il Sung's birthday is April 15. Day of the Shining Star = Kim Jong Il's birthday is February 16. If I had to pick a month in which an ICBM would be tested, I'd pick April. I don't have a lot of confidence in that, but it does seem very likely to me that testing will resume this year in honor of the major birth anniversary and army foundation celebrations.
