While the use of waivers for medical-related reasons hasn't increased or decreased much, personal conviction waivers continue to significantly rise.\n~~~~~~\nCOMMENTS\n1)  Second-half of year statistics show a rate decline.\nCDC data shows that there is almost always a significant decrease in the rate of new cases after the beginning of summer; the graph of the number of cases  flattens.  During the most recent reporting week/period there was only 1 new case; the rest of the increase in the total number of cases was the result of adjustments to the number of cases reported in previous periods.  \n2)  We are nearing the end of the incubation period for anyone exposed at Disneyland and other entertainment venues in So Ca on 8/15, and passed it for people exposed in Las Vegas Aug 1-6.\n3)  75% of the cases this year have been in NY, and that outbreak has now been declared over.  Also, important steps have been taken to increase immunization rates in NY that should reduce the chances of another outbreak.\n4)  However, there's still many pockets of low immunization rates  (WI, CT, TX, border detention centers) where outbreaks involving significant numbers of cases could occur\n5)  But, there's been a lot of media attention and careful tracking of cases.  I've seen very detailed timelines for possible exposure after a person has been identified as having measles.  I've never seen such a thing before In sum:  the rate of new cases in recent months has decreased dramatically, so this year appears to be following the normal pattern.  The worst outbreak is over and significant steps have been taken to increase immunization rates and trace exposure(s).  So, I think that there won't be a hundreds and hundreds of new cases before the year ends. \n@Greyowlsova"], [19801, "2019-09-07T00:07:52Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.25, 0.7], "Measles Cases in 2019 From January 1 to August 29, 2019, 1,234** individual cases of measles have been confirmed in 31 states. \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbreaks.html The first bucket will be eliminated by next week."], [1333, "2019-09-06T19:11:06Z", [0.25, 0.5, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [172, "2019-09-05T22:07:41Z", [0.0, 0.75, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0], "Outbreak in NYC declared over.\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/09/03/new-york-city-declares-end-largest-measles-outbreak-nearly-years/"], [73217, "2019-09-05T20:39:24Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.4, 0.35, 0.15], "As of today the figure according to CDC is 1234 up to 29 Aug, which is 241 days of the year.

Simple math would suggest that if 1200 cases occurred in the first 8 months of the year we should expect about 600 more this year (assuming no seasonality). The start of the school year across the US could increase cases (https://academic.oup.com/aje/article-abstract/98/6/453/116877?redirectedFrom=fulltext).  The holiday travel season could also play a factor as more people congregate in airports for domestic and international travel. The counter-point to all of this is that a national focus and legislation (like in New York) will decrease the rate of outbreaks and new cases. Based on the fact that the first study cited is predicting 400 cases in Texas, simple math suggests 600 more this year, and the school year has just started across the country I am inclined to believe the 1600 - 1800 range.

In fact, exemptions have increased 28-fold, from 2300 in 2003 to 64,000 in\n2018 . . . \" \"Texas is the largest state by population that allows vaccine exemptions for religious or personal reasons,\" . . . The researchers used 2010 US Census data to create a model to simulate possible measles transmissions in the Texas population. The model incorporated 2018 vaccination rates for Texas schools and typical daily activities and interactions for 1000 simulations in each metropolitan area of the state. Each hypothetical scenario tracked infections over 9 months. They estimate that the median number of cases in Texas cities would likely range from 1 to 3 cases if 2018 vaccination rates are maintained during an outbreak, which is in line with case numbers seen in outbreaks that occurred between 2006 and 2017. However, the number of cases could climb above 400 in the Austin and Dallas-Fort Worth metro areas, according to the model's upper limit predictions. That number of cases would rival the largest outbreaks since US measles elimination in 2000. The combination of high population density and multiple undervaccinated schools would drive these outbreaks, the authors note. Specifically, 35 schools in Austin-Round Rock, 13 schools in Dallas-Fort Worth, and 15 schools in Tyler have vaccination rates below the estimated herd immunity lower threshold of 92%. When the researchers investigated the effects of even lower immunization rates than seen in 2018 \u2014 if existing trends were to continue in currently undervaccinated schools \u2014 they found exponentially greater outbreaks. For example, a 5% reduction in immunizations was correlated with a 40% to 4000% larger outbreak than would be seen with the 2018 vaccination rate, depending on the city.  The model estimates that 64% of those infected would be students whose parents had refused vaccination, whereas the other 36% cases would be \"bystanders,\" such as individuals too young or too ill to be vaccinated, those in whom the vaccine is contraindicated, and those in whom the vaccine had waned or was ineffective. The authors noted that even small networks could have big impacts, such as two schools in Tyler, Texas, whose vaccination rates are 70% and 85%. \"In the event of an outbreak in schools with undervaccinated populations, interventions targeted at these schools may be especially effective,\" Sinclair and colleagues write. \"Undervaccinated close-knit communities present an increased risk of outbreaks; mandating that schools with low vaccination rates plan for outbreak scenarios may help reduce outbreak sizes.\" With nonmedical vaccine exemptions available in 45 US states,. . . \n~~~~~~~\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-7380697/Measles-hits-Las-Vegas-infected-visitor-exposed-revelers-Luxor-Mandalay-Bay.html \"Measles hits Las Vegas: An infected visitor may have exposed revelers at the Luxor and Mandalay Bay, health officials warn.

In the first six months of 2019, reported measles cases are the highest they have been in any year since 2006, . . . There have been almost three times as many cases reported to date in 2019 as there were at this same time last year. This follows successive yearly increases since 2016, indicating a concerning and continuing upsurge in the overall measles burden worldwide.\n. . . However, cases have dramatically decreased in Madagascar in the past several months as a result of nationwide emergency measles vaccine campaigns, highlighting how effective vaccination is in ending outbreaks and protecting health.\n. . . \nThe largest outbreaks are in countries with low measles vaccination coverage, currently or in the past, which has left large numbers of people vulnerable to the disease. At the same time, protracted outbreaks are occurring even in countries with high national vaccination rates. This results from inequities in vaccine coverage, and gaps and disparities between communities, geographic areas, and among age-groups. When enough people who are not immune are exposed to measles, it can very quickly spread. The United States has reported its highest measles case count in 25 years. In the WHO European region, there have been close to 90,000 cases reported for the first six months of this year: this exceeds those recorded for the whole of 2018 (84 462) \u2013 already the highest in this current decade.\n. . . \n. . . High rates of vaccination coverage \u2013 95% nationally and within communities \u2013 are needed to ensure that measles is unable to spread. According to WHO and UNICEF coverage data released in July 2019, 86% children have received the first dose of measles vaccine and 69% the second. This means that around 20 million children in 2018 received no measles vaccine through their routine vaccination programmes. Furthermore, 23 countries have yet to introduce the second measles vaccine dose into their national schedule.\n. . . \nAccording to its latest travel recommendations, everyone 6 months and older should be protected against measles prior to travel to an area where measles is circulating. Anyone unsure of their vaccination status should consult with their healthcare provider. WHO recommends that travelers get vaccinated against measles at least 15 days prior to travel.\n. . . for the period of January 1 through July 31 2019, 182 countries reported 364,808 measles cases to WHO. For this same period last year, 129,239 measles cases were reported from 181 countries. For the current 2019 period, the WHO African Region has recorded a 900% (i.e. a 10-fold increase) increase, the European Region 120% (more than twofold increase), the Eastern Mediterranean Region 50% (1.5 fold increase), the Western Pacific Region 230% (a threefold increase); the South-East Asia Region and the Region of the Americas each saw a 15% decrease in reported cases. Measles transmission is typically seasonal, peaking in spring in temperate climates and after the rainy season in the tropics. . . \n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  It appears to me that a significant percent of the cases in the US have originated outside the country.  Since the rest of the world is experiencing such a surge in cases, I assume the US will also experience continuing new cases, and at a higher than normal rate. I expect more attention to the efficacy of vaccination and tightening requirements for vaccination prior to enrollment in school will dampen the increase in transmission enabled by schools re-starting.   Maybe I'm not looking i the right places, but I'm not seeing a surge in anti-vaxx campaigns.

We could end July with 50 or fewer cases. That suggests an average of 20 or fewer cases per month (average) from August to December (with a September low and numbers creeping back up in Oct-Dec).  That would put us at 1,245 or less in an ideal case.  There are a lot of variables to consider - healthcare professionals are raising the alarm (but they have been doing so for years), both govt and private orgs are stepping in for some cases (tightening rules that allow parents to skip vaccination for school or summer camp, for example), misinformation about vaccines is still being spread, and anti-vaxx parents are organizing to get around the rules, just to name a few. Ultimately the \"ideal\" situation is unlikely to reflect the real world as a single hot spot could send this estimate over 1250.  I've conservatively raised [0, 1,250] by 6% to 28% but will continue to monitor. My estimated range is comfortably below 1,500; raising the probability of (1,250, 1,500) by 15% to 60%. Reaching 1,500 would require some of the following events that we have not seen in recent years:\n- Unseasonally high late summer cases\n- An unusually high spike in November and December (leading into a second consecutive high year for measles)\n- Unusually high penetration into the unvaccinated population\n- Unusually high penetration into the vaccinated population (you can still get the measles if vaccinated, though very very unlikely and usually very mild) While one or two of those may occur, it is very unlikely that we will see +250 cases over the above estimate in the back half of the year.

I calculate seasonality using incidence data from [3] for Michigan and taking the second year in the first figure, which looks the most representative out of all of them. After extracting the data, this implies the following seasonal factors (the percentages are percent of the average January-June value). July\t99%\nAugust\t86%\nSeptember\t52%\nOctober\t39%\nNovember\t43%\nDecember\t47% Applying these percentages to the historical 2019 data, I estimate the following number of cases: July\t182\nAugust\t159\nSeptember\t95\nOctober\t71\nNovember\t79\nDecember\t87 The total for the year then is 1,771. However, it's worth noting that the estimated July value is higher than the actual June value, which is quite unusual in light of historical data. It's therefore quite possible that this model overestimates the number of cases. As an alternative case, I use the Google Search results for measles from [3] to estimate seasonal factors.

This does not account for seasonality, regional outbreaks, or regional efforts by health professionals and legislators to curb infection. Even in the best case, it is extremely unlikely that efforts to curb infection will be so successful that infections will remain under 1250.

Figure for the week to June 6 was 41. Extrapolating this value then the figure for June would be around 175. From this it looks like the rate of infection is decreasing substantially.\nLooking at more detail where the outbreaks are, the CDC indicate that ongoing outbreaks (defined as at least 3 people affected) are happening in New York State (2 places), California (3 places), Pennsylvania and Washington state.  \nLooking at figures for these states (from the CDC link to the state health authorities) it seems that the main outbreak in Washington is over, but in May six people were affected in a different part of Washington state which could signify a new outbreak starting.  How bad this will be will depend upon how well the outbreak can be contained and whether it hits a large community of unvaccinated people like the New York outbreaks did.\nI couldn't find much info for Penn state, but New York City's data shows that the rate of infection is tailing off (Jan 34, Feb 69, Mar 160, Apr 177, May 86).  New York has had a very aggressive containment policy including mandatory vaccination and this seems to be curtailing spread of the disease and will probably continue to do so, especially if people in neighbouring areas who are unvaccinated decide that the risk is high and they should get vaccinated.  \nThe outbreaks in California were much smaller (Jan 4, Feb 2, Mar 14, Apr 21, May 7) but still show the same type of distribution as the NYC and the overall figures, namely that the rate of infection increased significantly in March, increased yet further in April and then decreased noticeably in May. \nIt seems to me that there will most likely be fewer cases in June than in May, and this downward trend may well continue.  I heard that spring is the peak time for measles, at least in Europe, and think that it would be similar for the US but haven't fact checked this.  If this is the case, then we would expect the number of new cases to tail off significantly over the summer and into early autumn.  Having said that, there are usually more people travelling in the summer who could potentially catch measles abroad and bring it back to the US, and the CDC indicated that most of the outbreaks started with people bringing measles into the US from trips abroad.\nFrom the data on the 2014 outbreak in the US (thanks cafebedouin for providing the link to the weekly tables) it seems that the number of new cases tails off very rapidly once the infection is past its peak.\nAssuming that (i) there is no new large NYC style outbreak in an unvaccinated community, and (ii) measles is more prevalent in the spring, then I would expect the total number to be below 1500 by the end of the year.
