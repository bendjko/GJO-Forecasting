However, it was not appropriate for Facebook to impose an \u2018indefinite\u2019 suspension.\" So that all looks good for DJT to return, especially since it will be hard to argue (or at least hard to prove) the harm is as clear and present as, say, on Jan 6th. And if he were not still harping about the election, I think it's super high likelihood he's back on. So the question is going to be how hard they hold him to account for the fact that he isn't dropping the claims, and if they can spell out that logic in a rule that is generally applicable.

The Trump Organization held talks with Parler last year about potentially taking a stake in the company, according to people familiar with the matter. BuzzFeed was the first to report the talks.\nThe main reason that platforms such as Twitter & FB gave a wide berth to people like DJT is that they were good for business.\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/16/how-twitter-banned-trump/\nExcerpt from the above article - \nPublic figures were so important to Twitter that, like Facebook, the company long gave them a newsworthiness exemption. They were allowed to say things that would be considered to be policy violations if uttered by everyday users, on the grounds that what these people said was in the public interest. Twitter, and Dorsey in particular, long maintained that even the worst lies should be corrected with more speech rather than removing them. It was Twitter\u2019s responsibility to show \u201chow global leaders think and treat the people around them,\u201d he said. I just think a separate platform for conservatives could be perceived as a threat, which will force Zuckerberg to act and clarify his position rather that drag this indefinite ban for too long.\nFrom DJT`s perspective it makes good sense to try and get on a social media platform as soon as possible rather than waiting for a year, else his supporters may lose their momentum/interest"], [92079, "2021-05-16T02:08:40Z", [1.0], ""], [100273, "2021-05-16T00:46:27Z", [0.1], "Not if Biden is still President.

It also calls for them to apply this standard going forward if rules are broken in the same way.  So Facebook could make the ban permanent OR set a limit, then reimpose the limited penalty if the rule is broken again. They could also create a rule that states after X number of suspensions, the restriction is permanent.

If Facebook identifies that the user poses a serious risk of inciting imminent violence, discrimination or other lawless action at that time, another time-bound suspension should be imposed when such measures are necessary to protect public safety and proportionate to the risk.\" I suspect that Trump using the platform will no longer be deemed an imminent risk of increased violence and he'll be allowed back on.
