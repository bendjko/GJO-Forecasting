This article says that the feature should be launched in the US within a matter of weeks: https://electrek.co/2020/04/03/tesla-release-autopilot-intersection-navigation-weeks-us-months-worldwide/.  My initial reaction was that it would be difficult to launch the feature this year owing to regulatory requirements. However, I now believe that regulatory approval shouldn\u2019t be an issue insofar as the US is concerned. Tesla has released various autonomous features for its vehicles in the past and US regulatory approval doesn\u2019t appear to have been an issue. I found an article which says \u201c\u2026 as long as Tesla (or any automaker) plans to upgrade its FMVSS-compliant vehicles with software alone, or even hardware like processors that aren't regulated by FMVSS, that update wouldn't require any form of regulatory approval..\u201d (https://www.thedrive.com/tech/29338/what-are-the-regulatory-barriers-to-full-self-driving). Regulatory approval may be an issue in some parts of the world but the question doesn\u2019t require the feature to have been released in more than one location - the US will suffice.  I don\u2019t think Covid-19 will prevent Tesla from launching the feature this year. As indicated above, it seems as though most of the work has already been done. A lot of the work needing to be done is in relation to software which is relatively easy to do remotely. I can\u2019t rule out that, if the situation in the US gets really bad, it may cause a slight delay, hence why I think there is an outside chance that it will be launched between July and September.
