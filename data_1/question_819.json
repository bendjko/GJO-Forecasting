India will settle oil contracts with Iran in rupee using a bank in the Gulf nation post November 4 when the US sanctions would freeze all payment channels using international currency. Sources privy to the development told FC Iranian Bank Pasargad could become the channel for rupee/rial dealings in the oil trade between the two countries later this month when the real picture emerges about the scale of disruption in oil supplies from the Gulf country. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has given its nod to Pasargad to set up a branch in Mumbai. Indian oil companies would use this branch to deposit their payment for oil imported from Iran in rupee. Also, an earlier rupee payment window opened with UCO Bank or IDBI Bank may be utilised again for making payments for Iranian oil post sanctions.\n\u201cThe rupee/rial trade with Iran is again being looked seriously as the spectre of wider sanctions on the Gulf nation looms.

U.S. Special Representative for Syrian Engagement James Jeffrey recounted to reporters on Wednesday \"five examples of state-on-state violence\" over the past six weeks in Syria. These included recent tensions between the various armed forces present in the country . . . you don\u2019t normally see this kind of state-on-state potential for conflict,\" Jeffrey said.  \"And so I think everybody is concerned,\" he added. . . . \u2014the latest phase of the seven-year war has threatened to pit several of these participating nations directly against one another. At least three of the instances recounted by Jeffrey included the potential for direct U.S. military action.\n. . . \n Early last month, Russia warned that the Syrian armed forces would carry out operations within a patch of southern Syria called Al-Tanf, which is currently occupied by U.S. forces and a remnant of Pentagon support for insurgents.  . . .  In Syria's eastern Middle Euphrates River Valley, Iranian missile strikes targeted ISIS positions just three miles from U.S. soldiers and their local allies earlier this month. Iran's national security adviser warned two weeks ago that the attacks\u2014which officially came in response to a deadly, ISIS-claimed attack on a military parade at home\u2014was also a reply to warnings by his U.S. counterpart. Outside the roughly quarter of the country held by the Syrian Democratic Forces and the border region of Al-Tanf, the Syrian government has regained much of its territory in recent years. The final enclave of rebels and jihadis opposed to Assad's rule is the northwestern province of Idlib. As pro-Syrian government fighters amassed around the area, the U.S. threatened to intervene against an attack on Idlib and Russia sent warships to the Mediterranean Sea to stage war games, in what was widely seen as an effort to block potential Western military action. The U.S. has struck Syrian government targets on two prior occasions, both times in response to allegations that Assad had ordered chemical weapons attacks. In response to apparent reports that Syria would use banned toxic gas in Idlib, Jeffrey said Wednesday that the U.S. \"took a very, very strong position on the use of chemical weapons, which was almost a necessity for such an operation if they wanted to succeed, but we made it very clear that there would be very, very strong repercussions.\"\n"], [1333, "2018-10-18T20:48:16Z", [0.1], "Iran is routinely overflying the fleet with drones.

But again, any really lethal confrontation between national military forces is very unlikely as it is not in the best interest for either of the 2 countries. https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/23/world/middleeast/iran-us-conflict-explainer.html"], [82, "2018-10-05T17:25:41Z", [0.1], ""], [12453, "2018-10-05T11:54:41Z", [0.2], ""], [58317, "2018-10-04T21:26:19Z", [0.04], "Moving my probability from 6% to 4% because there is less time for anything to happen."], [61364, "2018-10-04T20:23:20Z", [0.05], ""], [47482, "2018-10-04T19:50:10Z", [0.1], "Affirming"], [36194, "2018-10-04T18:59:43Z", [0.05], ""], [368, "2018-10-04T16:28:46Z", [0.0], ""], [34725, "2018-10-04T08:30:30Z", [0.0], ""], [39814, "2018-10-04T07:08:08Z", [0.05], ""], [61360, "2018-10-04T06:45:54Z", [0.0], ""], [705, "2018-10-04T01:06:00Z", [0.04], ""], [368, "2018-10-03T18:25:15Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2018-10-03T12:22:43Z", [0.0], ""], [2965, "2018-10-03T00:44:55Z", [0.0], ""], [61341, "2018-10-02T20:19:35Z", [0.05], ""], [368, "2018-10-02T20:14:53Z", [0.0], ""], [1056, "2018-10-02T13:50:32Z", [0.0], ""], [58782, "2018-10-02T10:53:32Z", [0.1], ""], [34725, "2018-10-02T10:06:20Z", [0.0], ""], [60544, "2018-10-02T01:52:14Z", [0.05], "Iran will not likely initiate conflict with the United States because the United States and its allies possess a great deal of influence over it economically, in the sense that further sanctions could seriously interrupt Iran's development.

Here\u2019s why.\n\nThe Islamic State is on the brink of total military defeat . . . The Islamic State\u2019s caliphate has collapsed. They have almost no territory remaining except for a small piece of eastern Syria and the militants appear to have very little combat power left.\u00a0. . . . And the latest intelligence reports suggest the group has very little \u2015 if any \u2015 operational control over its affiliate groups in other countries in Africa and beyond. Yet top U.S. officials at the Pentagon and the White House are avoiding anything that sounds like a declaration of victory. Many experts believe that\u2019s because U.S. leaders want to maintain public support for other ground-level missions in the region that are harder to sell to the American people, politically. But so far, no one has stood at the Pentagon podium and directly said that balancing regional threats like Iran and \u201cShia influence\u201d is part of the current policy or strategy. \u201cNever give up a sales pitch that\u2019s working,\u201d said Barry Posen, director of the Security Studies Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. . . .  Officially, the only mission for U.S. troops on the ground in the region \u2015 including about 5,000 U.S. troops in Iraq and 2,200 in Syria \u2015 is to defeat and destroy ISIS. But recently the White House has begun to reveal a massive new mission on the horizon for U.S. troops in the Middle East: containing Iran. National security adviser John Bolton on Monday said countering Iran\u2019s influence in Syria and elsewhere is a major goal of the U.S. military mission in the Middle East. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to leave as long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders, and that includes Iranian proxies and militias,\u201d Bolton said, signaling a fundamental shift from the current counter-terrorism operations to a mission focused more on geopolitical maneuvering and proxy warfare. Bolton\u2019s comments echo sentiments that are widely shared among the think tank experts and hawkish defense officials in Washington who allude to the real purpose of U.S. forces as balancing against regional threats like Iran. \u201cI would prefer to keep U.S. troops there indefinitely, because they also serve a purpose in blocking Iran\u2019s freedom of movement and access to lines of communication that would connect western Iraq with Lebanon,\u201d said James Phillips, senior research fellow for Middle Eastern affairs at the Heritage Foundation. \u201cI think, particularly, it would be a mistake to abandon the small garrison at Al Tanf, at the Syrian-Iraqi border and near Jordan.\u201d The forward operating base at Al Tanf, manned by dozens of U.S. troops, but far from the concentration of ISIS, is one example of a larger strategic mission cloaked in the mantle of counter-ISIS operations. Al Tanf is located at the strategic border area between Iraq, Syria and Jordan. The Marine Corps recently conducted a \u201cshow of force\u201d mission near Al Tanf as a reaction to a potential Russian military operation in the region. For years, Syria has festered with rival militias and foreign fighters, including Iranian-backed militias and Russian military forces, both supporting Syria\u2019s embattled regime led by President Bashar Al Assad, as well as Kurdish forces and Turkish-backed groups vying for control over Syria\u2019s north.\n. . . \nDespite the recent comments from the White House about leaving troops in Syria to contain Iranian influence, the Pentagon has not yet articulated any military mission with that aim. \u201cRight now our troops inside Syria are there for one purpose, and that\u2019s under the U.N. authorization about defeating ISIS,\u201d Mattis said Monday. . . .   Mattis said the U.S. presence in Syria is based on United Nations-led peace talks for Syria rather than Iran\u2019s activities. \u201cIt\u2019s the Geneva process and the Geneva process has got to come to a conclusion if we are to see this end,\u201d Mattis said. Nevertheless, Mattis acknowledged concerns about Iran and its malevolent influence. Mattis has voiced concerned about Iran for years, dating back to his time as the commander of U.S. Central Command under former president Obama. \u201cAs part of this overarching problem, we have to address Iran,\u201d Mattis said. \u201cEverywhere you go in the Middle East where there\u2019s instability you will find Iran. So in terms of getting to the end state of the Geneva process, Iran, too, has a role to play, which is to stop fomenting trouble.\u201d The U.S. exercises influence in Syria from the Kurdish areas in the country\u2019s northeast. The U.S.-backed SDF controls much of that region, while Turkish-backed rebels control select portions of the north. And whatever dream that previously existed of an independent Kurdish state in northern Iraq has largely died. U.S. leaders have shown little willingness to offend their NATO ally Turkey in favor of such a move, as exemplified in the Manbij region stand-off. Keeping portions of northern Syria under Turkish control, though, would satisfy some of the United States\u2019 geopolitical ambitions: It weakens Assad and keeps Syria poor. \u201cThe anti-Iran, anti-Russia policy wonks want to deny reconstruction to Syria because they don\u2019t want to reward Russia and Iran by having an asset that\u2019s worth something,\u201d Landis said. \u201cThey would prefer Syria poor and broken down, rather than a Syria that can re-arm.\u201d\n. . . \nThe airstrike campaign against ISIS is tapering off. By July 2018, the latest data available, the Inherent Resolve mission has conducted a little more than 3,000 weapon releases for the year. That\u2019s compared to nearly 28,000 for the same time period through July 2017, roughly 17,000 through July 2016, and almost 14,000 through July 2015.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  What I gleaned from this article is that what our people at Al-Tanf are really there for is to contain/confront Iran.

Rumors were spread by Iranian government-backed media that Islamic State (IS) militants killed or wounded Coalition forces in the town of Hasaka. \u201cWe have no reports of any Coalition or US forces injured or killed in our region or area of responsibility,\u201d Army Colonel Sean Ryan, Spokesperson for Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR), the US-led coalition against IS, told Kurdistan 24. On Sunday, the semi-official Iranian government Fars News Agency quoted the pro-Hezbollah Al Manar News Network, suggesting that \u201ca number of US army soldiers were killed or wounded in an IS attack on their convoy in Hasaka city in Northeastern Syria.\u201d According to Nicholas A. Heras, a Middle East security analyst at the Washington-based Center for a New American Security, the Assad government and its allies have a great interest in undermining confidence in the Coalition forces in northern and eastern Syria. \u201cOne means to try to achieve this goal is to conduct information operations aimed against the Coalition, trying to create a narrative that Coalition forces are unpopular with the local population and constantly under attack in northern and eastern Syria,\u201d he told Kurdistan 24. Furthermore, Fars News also quoted the Russian government, suggesting US forces would withdraw from the al-Tanf base. The US and an Arab partner force maintain a position at al-Tanf, near Syria\u2019s border with Jordan and Iraq. That force sits astride the Baghdad-Damascus highway and blocks a major potential route for Iran\u2019s \u201cland bridge\u201d to the Mediterranean. The relatively small al-Tanf garrison has sporadically come under assault from shadowy, hostile forces. \u201cIranians, and the Russians these days are pushing a lot of rumors about US forces in al-Tanf; it\u2019s part of their plan,\u201d Mozahem al-Saloum, the former spokesperson of Maghawir al-Thawra (MaT), the group that controls al-Tanf, stated. \u201cThey want to find a way to push out US forces from Tanf. Their tactic is pushing a lot of rumors and propaganda,\u201d he added. In a statement on Monday, MaT clarified that the Russian-based Sputnik news and Iranian-backed Al-Mayadeen TV had spread reports about a false deal between Russia and the US government. However, MaT said there was a deal with the Al-Qarytayn tribes whose fighters areto leave the deconfliction zones with their families to regime-held areas. \u201cThe faction fighters have left Rubkan camp as have their families, and they are not currently affiliated with Coalition Forces,\u201d MaT concluded.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  It seems to me that the circumstances are such that it will happen--sooner or later."], [35683, "2018-09-18T19:46:48Z", [0.05], ""], [368, "2018-09-18T19:11:10Z", [0.0], ""], [61020, "2018-09-18T17:47:38Z", [1.0], ""], [691, "2018-09-18T12:53:17Z", [0.0], ""], [61016, "2018-09-18T10:29:35Z", [0.05], "No. US is confronted with the possibility of force on other countries for economic sanctions against trade with Iran."], [43003, "2018-09-18T05:37:08Z", [0.08], "US not bombing in Yemen, but still could strike in Syria and kill Quds or Basij there.

Last week senior figures in Australia\u2019s Turnbull Government told ABC they believed the U.S. was preparing to bomb Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, perhaps as early as next month. But Mattis on Friday called the report \u201cfiction at best.\u201d \u201cI have no idea where the Australian news people got that information. I am confident it is not something that\u2019s being considered right now,\u201d Mattis told a small group of reporters. Frankly more concerning to Mattis are the real reports of Iran-backed Houthi rebels attacking oil ships off the coast of Yemen. These attacks, which lead Saudi Arabia to halt oil shipments through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait (the narrows at the southern end of the Red Sea through which about 5 million barrels of oil pass every day) underscore the threat Tehran poses to global energy choke points at a time of growing tension between Iran and the United States, Keith Johnson reports for Foreign Policy. Meanwhile, Iran\u2019s currency has plunged to a record low as renewed U.S. sanctions, slated to go into effect Aug. 7, loom. ...On the administration\u2019s reported policy of regime change in Iran:\nNothing has changed for us. There\u2019s [no regime collapse or regime change policy] that\u2019s been instituted. https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/07/30/security-brief-no-trump-is-not-about-to-order-a-strike-on-iran-u-s-may-return-to-north-korea-to-look-for-more-war-remains-mattis-vs-the-first-amendment/ ...It comes amid intense sabre-rattling by US President Donald Trump and his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani. The ABC has been told Australian defence facilities would likely play a role in identifying targets in Iran, as would British intelligence agencies. But a senior security source emphasised there was a big difference between providing accurate intelligence and analysis on Iran's facilities and being part of a \"kinetic\" mission. \"Developing a picture is very different to actually participating in a strike,\" the source said.  \"Providing intelligence and understanding as to what is happening on the ground so that the Government and allied governments are fully informed to make decisions is different to active targeting.\" ...The top-secret Pine Gap joint defence facility in the Northern Territory is considered crucial among the so-called \"Five Eyes\" intelligence partners \u2014 the US, UK, Australia, Canada and New Zealand \u2014 for its role in directing American spy satellites. Analysts from the little-known spy agency Australian Geospatial-Intelligence Organisation would also be expected to play a part.  Canada would be unlikely to play a role in any military action in Iran, nor would the smallest Five Eyes security partner New Zealand, sources said ...Last month Iran's nuclear chief opened a new nuclear enrichment facility that he said would comply with the nuclear deal Tehran signed with world powers in 2015.  Any US-led strike on Iranian targets would be fraught for a region bristling with tensions. Israel would have reason to be anxious about retaliation, given Iran rejects Israel's right to exist. That said, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in April invoked the so-called \"Begin Doctrine\" that calls on the Jewish state to ensure nations hostile to Israel be prevented from developing a nuclear weapons capability. \"Israel will not allow regimes that seek our annihilation to acquire nuclear weapons,\" Mr Netanyahu said. http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-07-27/donald-trump-may-be-prepared-to-strike-iran-sources-say/10037728\nhttp://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-07-28/james-mattis-dismisses-reports-possible-strike-iran-as-fiction/10046824 ...Australian network ABC reported senior figures within the Australian government believe Trump is preparing a strike, and that it could even happen next month. \n They also claimed both British and Australian intelligence agencies are helping the U.S. with targeting.\nhttp://www.tehrantimes.com/news/425853/Australian-PM-No-reason-to-believe-U-S-will-bomb-Iran National security adviser John Bolton convened a meeting Thursday of Pentagon and other top officials as the Trump administration considers how to flesh out its strategy on Iran.  The meeting, which follows Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear accord and to reimpose tough economic sanctions on Tehran, comes as key elements of the administration\u2019s Iran policy have been unclear.  Among them: what the U.S. might offer in return for a new agreement with Tehran, and whether Washington is prepared to use military force along with economic pressure to roll back Iran\u2019s assertive posture in the Middle East. The discussions took place among members of the administration\u2019s Principals Committee, a cabinet-level panel on national-security issues that Mr. Bolton chairs. Its members include Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who attended the Thursday session. The White House didn\u2019t announce the meeting or detail any outcome, but administration officials said it was just the third time that Mr. Bolton has convened the group since assuming his post in April. ...One purpose of Mr. Bolton\u2019s meeting Thursday, officials said, was to discuss a \u201cholistic\u201d strategy to curb Iranian influence in the Middle East region instead of looking at each country on a case-by-case basis. It is unclear what military options might have been discussed. In the past, the Defense Department has worked on limited military options, such as stopping Iranian weapons and equipment from reaching the Houthis, who are battling the U.S.-backed government in Yemen. The Pentagon isn\u2019t eager to get into a war with Iran at a time when its strategy emphasizes building up capabilities to deter Russia and China, and the outcome of talks with North Korea is still uncertain. ...After Mr. Trump decided in May to leave the accord, Mr. Pompeo outlined 12 requirements for reaching a new agreement with Iran, including the end of Iran\u2019s support for militant groups in the region and the prohibition on uranium enrichment. To isolate Tehran economically and politically, the administration also threatened sanctions on nations that don\u2019t end imports of oil from Iran by Nov. 4. ...In a speech in Kansas City, Mo., to the Veterans of Foreign Wars on Tuesday, Mr. Trump said he was \u201cready to make a real deal\u201d with Iran. But some former officials believe the goal of others in the administration is to weaken and perhaps even destabilize the Iranian regime.  \u201cWhat we see from Trump himself is the notion that he can negotiate a bigger and better deal by using pressure to bring the Iranians back to the table with more American leverage,\u201d said Suzanne Maloney, a former State Department official who is at the Brookings Institution. \u201cThat view isn\u2019t shared by others in the administration like the national security adviser and secretary of state, who see sanctions as an end in itself.\u201d Mr. Bolton and Mr. Pompeo have insisted they aren\u2019t pursuing regime change.\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/after-trumps-threat-to-iran-white-house-convenes-a-policy-meeting-1532597520"], [19801, "2018-07-31T00:34:19Z", [0.0], "Despite exchanging bellicose threats with President Donald Trump, Iranian officials consider the possibility of a military confrontation with the United States \u201cvery low\u201d.

Iran / USA relationships he cuts unilateral and he is trying to subdue IRAN and the supporters of IRAN in the IRAN deal, that is the EU, Russia and China, too. The costs of a military war against IRAN is tremendously higher as a macroeconomic war, that he is convinced to win easily with minimum costs for USA and maximum penalty costs for all others. I think, he does not learn anymore anything and he does not accept any arguments against his convictions. He strictly followed his plans declared decades before now and he strictly follows all promises he made to his base during the election 2016. He wants to make many deals for benefits of USA, where all deal counterparts have to bear the burden of costs 100%. Any unilateral war of USA would create burden of costs for USA, only. Therefore the military war will not happen, instead he will intensify the unilateral macroeconomic world war created by him on behalf of USA. One reason for him is also the Iran deal. He assumed that he can with it also hit the Iran and their supporters of IRAN deal. USA wants peace from Iran for low costs with the constraint for Iran: No Atom weapons. Iran wants peace from USA with constraint of sovereignty ensured by USA and no threats by Israel by its Atom weapons. The costs of war with Iran for Israel and USA is too high only for prevention of armaments of Iran with Atom waepons. The political chaos of war time and after war time of Middle East is included in my costs argument. The actual rhetoric shouting on all sites is a peaceful sign for me. The Iran has tremendous economic difficulties for years and big parts of young people of Iran venerate the US culture and the USA. This is known to NSA, CIA and US Army. The Iran wants generally peace and not war. Iran has been victim of aggression by Irak, who haven gotten long time support by the \u201cWest\u201d. Some parts of Iran Establishments fighting during Irak / Iran war and they are hating the USA a lot. Very many US citizens have been killed by Iran people in the past decades said CIA officials. The public humiliation of USA by Iran in the past has created an extrem level of pain for US Administration. The relationship of IRAN and USA is burdened by emotions from this events. The actual US President style to act gives high probability of disruptive peaceful deals for low costs of all, if the counterparts accept his style to act. The Iranian officials needed support in empathy, how an extreme utilitarian US President thinks and acts, to achieve a new \u201cfair\u201d agreement with the USA."], [1034, "2018-07-22T16:07:32Z", [0.0], ""], [1333, "2018-07-22T15:33:54Z", [0.2], ""], [59141, "2018-07-22T13:48:40Z", [0.15], "There is always a possibility of a minor attack say at sea between US and Iran navial forces.

Assad gets what he wants - a pretty good chance of dying in bed of old age. Russia gets its bases in the eastern Mediterranean - which it wants primarily for prestige purposes anyway. Israel gets guaranteed security on its northern and northwestern border. The U.S. gets rid of an ongoing diplomatic headache. The ordinary citizens of Syria don't make out so well, since they're still stuck with Assad.

She says U.S. reports show that Assad's forces and militias have violated the cease-fire with airstrikes, rocket attacks and artillery. Nauert says the U.S. demands that Russia \"restrain\" Assad's forces from further action in the zone covered by the truce. She says Secretary of State\u00a0Mike Pompeo\u00a0relayed that message to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov by phone over the weekend. The U.S. says it expects \"all parties to respect the cease-fire.\" ___ 5:35 p.m. Turkey's top diplomat says a Syrian Kurdish militia will begin withdrawing from a strategic town in northern Syria on July 4. Speaking to private CNN Turk on Thursday, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu says the Kurdish People's Protection Units or YPG would leave Manbij as part of a recent Turkish-American deal. The United States has been backing and arming the militia to combat the Islamic State group in Syria. That support has caused a rift with its NATO ally Turkey, which considers the YPG a terror organization and an extension of a Kurdish insurgency within its own borders. The minister said the United States would take back arms it has provided to the group. According to a \"roadmap\" on Manbij, Cavusoglu said the U.S. will \"take weapons from the YPG and we will supervise and observe that.\" __ 1:40 p.m. Syrian state media say government forces have shelled rebel-held areas in the south, in new violence that further undermined an international \"de-escalation\" agreement backed by the United States. The intermittent shelling over the past week comes as the government has threatened to launch a new offensive on the area, which borders Jordan and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. The U.S., Russia and Jordan negotiated a de-escalation agreement in July. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported the shelling Thursday on areas north of the city of Daraa, saying more than 12,000 people have been displaced by the shelling since Tuesday. State media say the shelling targeted \"terrorists\" posts, destroying their weapons."], [39062, "2018-06-21T17:41:03Z", [0.0], ""], [59106, "2018-06-21T16:54:09Z", [0.2], ""], [40617, "2018-06-21T15:14:19Z", [0.01], ""], [43311, "2018-06-20T22:50:09Z", [1.0], "Interestig new facet.

There are heightened tensions in the Middle East, between Israel, Saudi Arabia and Iran. Additionally, Iran continues to provoke both Saudi Arabia from Yemen and Israel from Lebanon and Syria. Because of the religious and ideological nature of the current Iranian regime, spreading Shiia Islam is an imperative. \nAdditionally, Iran aspires to be the region's hegemon. \nIn order to accomplish these goals as well as to sustain itself against the perceived threats represented by Israel and Saudi Arabia in the region, it has sought nuclear weapons and foments terrorism.  Since the implementation of the JCPOA, as well as the crises created by the Islamic State in Iraq and the civil war in Syria, Iran has jumped at the window of opportunity, spreading its influence---powerfully into Iraq and Syria---throughout the Middle East. Now, why should it reverse course? It has determined to wage war against Israel and to gain regional dominance.  Tensions between the US, her allies in the Middle East, and Iran are heightened by US withdrawal from the JCPOA, the proxy war waged in Yemen and the proxy war being waged by Hizballah and other Shia militants.  If Iran and its allies perceive that the US is withdrawing, or is seriously contemplating withdrawal from the region, this mitigates the immediate risk of a lethal confrontation. If we withdraw from Syria and Iraq in substantial numbers any time very soon, we will lessen the likelihood of a lethal confrontation with Iran---immediately---but heighten its likelihood, and potential for lethality, in the long run.  Short term: within a two year time period. Long term: two years and onward. While a negotiated settlement of some sort regarding the political arrangement of the region's territories and governance is probably necessary, complete withdrawal of US troops is a terrible, terrible idea. The vacuum left behind will only result in a resurgence of ISIS and more sectarian violence. This will pose security problems for Europe as well as for the US and our Middle Eastern allies. \u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7 Now the US has an opportunity to in the Middle East.

Analysis by PMOI/MEK\nMay 20, 2018\u00a0- There are a variety of different analysis on why the Iranian regime\u2019s Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) has remained completely silent in the face of increasing [attacks] against its forces and interests in Syria. First of all, any recognition of Iranian bases being targeted in Syria, without the proper response in retaliation, would be considered as this entity\u2019s military weakness. The current circumstances do not provide Tehran the flexibility it needs. On the other hand, to this day the Iranian regime has yet to deny its positions being targeted in Syria. If Tehran denies accusations of launching rockets into the Golan Heights, it must provide explanations on a variety of reports raised about its bases being targeted in Syria. The Iranian regime acknowledging these accounts would be tantamount to having a large number of military bases across Syria, and this would go against Tehran\u2019s claims of having only advisors on Syrian soil supporting the Assad regime\u2019s army. In response to the attack on the T4 base in Syria, the Iranian regime merely said a number of its \u201cmilitary advisors\u201d were killed in the attack and had their bodies returned to Iran for burial. Another possibility mentioned in numerous Iranian regime\u2019s conservative media outlets is that the IRGC is preparing a \u201cproper response\u201d to these attacks, to be carried out \u201cat the right timing.\u201d All the while, with each passing day and no proper response further indicates the IRGC\u2019s complete inability to actually carry out such a retaliation. This further shows the severity of the crisis the Iranian regime is facing and how it has no response to a growing regional isolation. https://english.mojahedin.org/i/why-has-irans-irgc-remained-silent-after-recent-attacks https://twitter.com/HeshmatAlavi/status/997883879263531008?s=19 https://twitter.com/kylewhe19442697/status/997884956255940608?s=19 https://twitter.com/tparsijende/status/997957793176064002?s=19 You take out an enemies methods of retaliation and defense BEFORE the main attack......"], [1333, "2018-05-20T18:18:23Z", [0.14], ""], [54571, "2018-05-20T18:02:09Z", [0.05], ""], [58437, "2018-05-20T17:26:58Z", [0.1], ""], [368, "2018-05-20T17:07:12Z", [0.0], ""], [16109, "2018-05-20T16:06:17Z", [0.15], ""], [38, "2018-05-20T15:50:55Z", [0.91], "While I believe it's basically a sure-thing that this will happen, I also think that both sides will try to prevent it from being reported, so I've decided to moderate my forecast a  bit. 100>91."], [57904, "2018-05-20T15:14:13Z", [0.15], "No, would only be bad for both countries"], [5018, "2018-05-20T03:15:53Z", [0.25], ""], [32258, "2018-05-20T00:41:01Z", [0.12], ""], [43311, "2018-05-19T22:43:37Z", [1.0], "Nothing from usual sources yet..... might be shhhhhhhhh..\nhttps://twitter.com/HeshmatAlavi/status/997883879263531008?s=19  https://twitter.com/kylewhe19442697/status/997884956255940608?s=19"], [57867, "2018-05-19T21:22:05Z", [0.28], "Bolton ups the ante.  \"Madman\" diplomacy only works until that starts to look normal.

The Afghans are recruited largely from Hazara refugees inside Iran, and sometimes had combat experience before joining the Iranian armed services; their relation to the Iranian military is only vaguely acknowledged and sometimes denied, despite the troops being uniformed fighters led by IRGC officers, trained and equipped in Iran, with state funerals involving uniformed IRGC personnel.[46] Among the dead are 2,000+ Afghans[30] and at least 160 Pakistanis.[47][48] Officially, the Afghan auxiliaries are part of the independent Liwa Fatemiyoun group, though news media outside of Iran often simply refers to this organization as the \"Fatemiyoun Brigade\" or \"Fatemiyoun Division\" of the IRGC, while the Pakistanis are part of the \"Zaynabiyun Brigade\". The Gatestone Institute estimated that as of late 2016, Iran controlled over 70,000 troops deployed in Syria (15,000 soldiers of the Iranian military, 20,000 members of Liwa Fatemiyoun, 20,000 Iraqi Shia militiamen in ten different groups, 10,000 Lebanese Hezbollah fighters, and 5,000 to 7,000 Pakistani and Palestinian militiamen), while also paying monthly salaries to 250,000 \"militia and agents\" supporting the Assad government.[23] Iranian_involvement_in_the_Syrian_Civil_War I do not mention this as directly supporting the case that US caused these casualties. \nRather - that if Iran is so heavily embedded that they have received these kinds of casualties, then they have similar exposure any time militias are hit. https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Iranian-Revolutionary-Guard-fighters-refusing-to-fight-in-Syria-report-432035\n\"Tehran has every reason to downplay the degree of its involvement and losses there.\" \"\"The Iranians have increased the extent of their direct military involvement in the conflict mostly in order to make up for the heavy attrition among Syrian army units,\" said Hilal Khashan, a political science professor at the American University of Beirut.\" \"hat is not a new development for Iran: Guard commanders regularly visited frontline troops during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. It was a way to boost morale and show camaraderie with ordinary soldiers. \"At the time of the Iran-Iraq war it was the same: high- ranking officers from the Revolutionary Guards would go to the front lines and sometimes they would get killed,\" said Mohsen Sazegara, a founding member of the Revolutionary Guards who is now a US-based dissident.\" He said the Guards were increasingly using Iranian commanders for the Afghan Fatemiyoun Brigade. \nhttps://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Iranian-Revolutionary-Guard-fighters-refusing-to-fight-in-Syria-report-432035"], [46762, "2018-05-04T04:52:51Z", [1.0], "On reasonable inference:  Here is a paper by the Middle East institute.

This report https://edition.cnn.com/2017/06/07/politics/us-led-coalition-syria-strike-at-tanf/index.html\nSays that Iranian forces have fired upon US forces.  Mentioned for two reasons:   not as a statement of fatalities, but on an expression of demonstrating a willingness by the iranians that they are willing to attack americans. \nSecondly.  This base al-tanf is the British/US base where 9 missile strikes were launched. It also demonstrates that the US fired on Iranian organized militias.  Two artillery pieces, an anti-aircrft weapon, and a tank were destroyed or damaged.   \nThis was an Iranian organized militia.  Do you think they would give them artillery and tanks without having significant control?

One of the brigades involved in that attack was the Baqir Brigade, which also participated in Russian attack on US forces. \nThere are pictures with the Quds chief - Soleimani.  And they document that they have been transported to Iran.\nAdditionally, they have declared jihad against american forces, something commanded by an Iranian higher up. This article: https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2018/02/bahraini-militant-group-adopts-irgc-branding.php\nDemonstrates Iranian branding of resistance forces - and how the commander is *IRANIAN*; how the militia travelled to Iran to receive training, for financial and logistical support by the RGC.   As a Bahraini force it is not implicated in the conflict in syria as far as I know - but it demonstrates the cookie cutter response that Iran uses around the Middle east. Using Iranian leaders and cadres to build militias networks.  Transport them, feed them, train them.   Embed with them.  In my previous post, I said that US missile strikes that occured April 14-17 and subsequent; which were documented as causing significant casualties to Iranian controlled militias; as well as to a base built by Iran, staffed by Iran, commanded by Iran, and provided logistical support by Iran.    I reiterate the question.   When the US made strikes against dozens of bases; when they have targeted very expensive and difficult to obtain munitions that are usually under direct control of Iranian commanders; when they target bases staffed by; controlled by; and supplied by Iranians. The articles I have cited are immaculately researched and reasoned.   They document Iranian strategic goals and operational tactics.......... So.  If we hit bases across syria, and those bases are staffed and controlled by iranians, and we inflicted significant casualties on these bases (previously cited, more than 60 in one case, 48 in another); and other sources have indicated that 18 Iranians died from US strikes.

So my answer only takes into consideration attacks that are attributable to the US.  Its possible that the \"lethal confrontation\" referred to in the question could be accidental (in the sense that it was not part of a plan by the US or Iranian government to attack the other) or deliberate. An accidental incident seems the most likely. An accidental lethal incident has not happened so far in the life of this question and it will probable remain unlikely, presumably because both sides are trying to avoid getting in situations where an accident is likely. Given the passage of time of this question I would now rate such an incident arising as 40% and the chances of positive attribution  as 10% (so overall 4%). I think there is raised chance of a deliberate attack. While Trump has been consistent in his criticism of Iran his advisors have changed and its possible that Trump believes that his tough stance on North Korea has as good as solved the Korean nuclear issue, and might feel that being tough on Iran would solve the Iranian issue. I think this raises the chance than it might be thought that it would be in the US's interest to attack Iranian forces. Presumably Trump has some advisors who are pointing out that the Korean issue has not been solved, that Kim wanting talks might not be related to any military show of strength from the US, and that US military action against Iran would more likely convince Iran that Kim has strengthened his position by building nuclear weapons (and Qaddafi's mistake was to abandon his nuclear plan).  I would rate the chance of a deliberate attack at about 10%.     So a 4% chance of an attributable accident + a 10% chance of a deliberate attack.

Truman, seven surface combatants and two submarines departed stateside for the region on April 11. They were scheduled to join a guided-missile cruiser, three guided-missile destroyers and a nuclear-powered attack submarine already in the Mediterranean to form a 15-ship-strong naval task force.\nIn addition, the USS Essex expeditionary strike group was slated to deploy to the area. Along with its escorts, the Essex would embark a squadron of Lockheed F-35B Lightning IIs, representing the long-awaited operational debut of the Joint Strike Fighter.\nWhile it may be the largest U.S. naval deployment to the region since the start of the Iraq war, much of the sea power involved in that conflict deployed to the Persian Gulf. Even in the 1991 Gulf War, which involved a larger force, the carriers operated from the Gulf and the Red Sea. In actuality, the largest American naval deployment to the Mediterranean occurred 36 years ago during a war that didn\u2019t directly involve the United States.\nOn June 6, 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon in response to an increasing number of provocations by the Palestinians. In some of the fiercest fighting of the modern era, the Israelis made quick of its adversaries, one of which was the military of Syria under the rule of Hafez Al Assad, father of current Syrian leader Bashar Al Assad. By June 14, Israel was laying siege to Beirut.\nAs Tel Aviv continued to place maximum pressure on the Lebanese capital, concerns arose in Washington and around the world of the possibility of the eruption of a larger regional war, mainly one drawing a deeper Syrian involvement. In response, the Reagan administration bolstered its presence in the region.\nThe nuclear-powered Nimitz-class supercarrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower and her battle group, which was on-station in the Mediterranean when the war began, in early June had been joined by USS John F. Kennedy, which had entered the Mediterranean via the Suez Canal from the Indian Ocean. On June 24, Eisenhower assisted in the evacuation of American citizens in Lebanon caught up in the conflict.\nThe next day, two more carrier battle groups, centered on USS Forrestal and USS Independence joined Kennedy and Eisenhower from the United States. The result was a 50-ship task force, with four carriers and their air wings at the core, along with a plethora of other surface combatants. This powerful juggernaut was to conduct a NATO exercise codenamed \u201cDaily Double,\u201d but were also ordered to prepare for additional evacuations and, possibly, rescue attempts of other Americans still in Lebanon.\nThough the siege of Beirut would last until August, the situation had stabilized to Washington\u2019s satisfaction within several days. Exercise Daily Double concluded, and Forrestal and Independence relieved Kennedy and Eisenhower of duty, sending the latter two home.\nThis \u201cdream team\u201d lasted for only days, but it represented one of the greatest assemblies of air and naval power in the post-Vietnam War era. It was certainly the most powerful concentration of carrier-based air power ever in the Mediterranean. By comparison, two carrier battle groups were deployed to the Mediterranean for the Iraq invasion in 2003.\nBy 1982, the carrier and its embarked air wing had improved by leaps and bounds from just a decade earlier. Apart from Forrestal, which still carried the McDonnell Douglas F-4S Phantom II, all three carriers were equipped with the Grumman F-14A Tomcat as its primary fleet-defense fighter.\nBy then in its second decade of service, the Tomcat had already proven to be one of the world\u2019s deadliest dogfighters. Armed with one of the most powerful radars of its time and the long-range AIM-54 Phoenix missile, alongside shorter-range missiles and a gun, the Tomcat would prove time and again in the Middle East it was one of the region\u2019s \u201ctop guns.\u201d Just a year prior, two F-14s had downed two Libyan fighters over the Gulf of Sidra, an area not too far from the shores of Lebanon. At top \u2014 USS Independence off Lebanon in 1982. Above \u2014 U.S. Navy warplanes over Lebanon in 1982. U.S. Navy photos\nThough the air wing of the early \u201880s lacked the more sophisticated precision-strike capabilities of today, they did not lack in range or bomb-toting capability. The primary attack platform of the day was the Grumman A-6E Intruder, which had been recently upgraded with the Target Recognition Attack Multi-Sensor system, which afforded it all-weather, day-and-night attack capability.\nThe Intruder had a combat radius of nearly 1,000 nautical miles and could carry up to 18,000 pounds of guided and unguided ordnance. By comparison, the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet can carry 17,750 pounds of ordnance, it has a combat radius of just 390 nautical miles. The early-\u201880s air wing also had a light attack option in the Ling-Temco-Vought A-7E Corsair II, which could carry unguided and limited amounts of guided munitions. It would be gradually replaced by the new McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet during the decade, but while lacking the sophistication of the newer platform, the Corsair still had superior range, to say nothing of the Intruder. This lack of range in both the legacy Hornet and the newer Super Hornet has been cited by analysts as problematic for the contemporary carrier air wing as it faces increasingly more capable great-power opposition in the militaries of countries such as China and Russia. The \u201cbig three\u201d of the \u201880s air wing were supported by the E-2C Hawkeye Airborne Early Warning plane, the EA-6B Prowler for electronic warfare, the S-3A Viking for anti-submarine warfare and the SH-3H Sea King helicopter for ASW and search-and-rescue.\nTactics, however, had yet to catch up with technology. Well into the 1980s, the U.S. Navy still employed approaches to strike warfare rooted in those used in Vietnam. Some lessons are learned only during a shooting war. The debacle the following year over Lebanon in which two Navy A-6Es were lost, one pilot killed, and another captured during an attack on Syrian targets precipitated improvements in tactics and training.\nThese lessons were incorporated into a new training syllabus at Strike Warfare Center, located at Naval Air Station Fallon, Nevada, where air wings train extensively to prepare for deployments.\nThe deployment of four carrier battle groups to the region was strategically significant in 1982, as the Middle East had yet to become the focal point of U.S. foreign policy and military activity it is today. As tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union ratcheted up one last time during the Cold War, America\u2019s focus was on defeating the Warsaw Pact in Central Europe and deterring the Soviets in the Pacific. Simultaneously, change was in the winds.\nRegional conflicts, such as the Yom Kippur War of 1973, showed the United States and the USSR could come to blows in regions other than Europe or Northeast Asia. Furthermore, conflicts in key regions of the world, such as the Middle East, could still have global implications, for example, by threatening the world\u2019s oil supply. Even today, the Syrian Civil War has created a refugee crisis that Europe has experienced great difficulty addressing. Exercise Daily Double reflected this new reality. The maneuvers were part of a larger Reagan administration strategy to convince NATO of the importance of the Persian Gulf region to the defense of Europe against Moscow. Finally, the Mediterranean, in many ways the cradle of Western civilization, has experienced armed conflict on a near-daily basis for centuries. From the 1970s to the end of the Cold War, the United States slowly but surely placed greater emphasis on preparing for these smaller, yet globally consequential conflicts that are far more likely to occur than any full-blown confrontation between the great powers. As a result, the United States began preparing to fight adversaries other than the Soviet Union, preparations that paid off in subsequent clashes with Libya, Iran, Iraq, Serbia, Afghanistan and, now, Syria. As the United States mulls the possibility of greater intervention in a Syrian war directly involving the great power of Russia, the regional power of Iran, and an endless list of other state and non-state actors, a scenario is developing where it will have to figure out a means of waging war against all types of adversaries at once. It may be the Middle East, not Europe or the Asia-Pacific, where America and its allies will be faced with its most complex military challenge."], [368, "2018-05-01T17:17:40Z", [0.0], ""], [25705, "2018-05-01T15:51:24Z", [0.0], "@Anneinak As you know, Russians killed by Americans in Syria (cited by Pompeo) did not belong to the Russian \"national military forces\".

Further, Russia, Iran, and Turkey committed to implementing a ceasefire in Syria in the near future. If both of these statements hold true, prospects of military clash between the US and Iran regarding Syria would be diminished, while opportunities to collaborate on rebuilding Syria would appear. Additionally, the question specifies that the fatality must be a member of national military forces for either side, rendering the probability low. However, lethal confrontation within this time period is still very much possible. The two countries have a history of conflict, strong ideological differences, and deeply-rooted suspicions of one-another, which strain diplomatic relations. The Trump administration remains dissatisfied with the handling of Iran's nuclear program and missile testing. These sentiments are certainly exacerbated by the recent naming of John Bolton, who is known to have a particularly hawkish attitude towards Iran, as the new US national security advisor.

Although it is very clear that Iran and the US have a very turbulent relationship that is the result of large historical differences and current matters, both sides have demonstrated that they are willing to rely on negotiation to resolve issues and promote common interests. The long standing issue that has divided both countries is Iran's nuclear program, which has resulted in sweeping sanctions placed on Iran from both the US and the EU. The sanctions have had a devastating effect on the economy. Inflation reached double digit numbers, food prices increased dramatically, and there is a growing divide between rich and poor. The government has struggled under sanctions, especially with the oil embargo, and was willing to reach out to the US for talks in 2013. The long negotiations that followed led to the Iran Deal, which is still in effect today. Although the Trump administration has referred to the Iran Deal, as the \"worst deal ever,\" he has received pressure from European allies to keep the the deal alive as their is no viable alternative. Despite Trump's seemingly decisive rhetoric, has offered sanctions relief and Congress is moving to address some of his concerns about the deal. However, with John Bolton becoming Trump's national security advisor and Mike Pompeo becoming head of the State Department, the Iran Deal is in limbo. Both are fierce critics of the deal, with Bolton arguing for air strikes against Iranian nuclear infrastructure. So far, however, there has not been a major shift in official tone and should it lead to airstrikes, it is likely that the US will consult European allies. If the Iran Deal manages to break, the administration is more likely to resort to more sanctions, which has previously shown to work against the regime.  http://www.newsweek.com/us-iran-relations-regime-change-revolution-wars-middle-east-768384\nhttp://www.iar-gwu.org/node/428\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/a9111e0c-f6cc-11e7-88f7-5465a6ce1a00\nhttps://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2018/04/02/trumps-new-national-security-team-likely-spells-disaster-for-the-iran-nuclear-deal/\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-to-extend-sanctions-relief-to-iran-keeping-nuclear-deal-in-placefor-now-1515736522\n"], [53063, "2018-04-03T00:30:36Z", [0.08], "If the Iranians go after the Kurds in Syria or Iraq, it's possible we will end up killing one or more Iranian armed forces member or that they will kill one or more of ours.

I suspect that any deal found would be enough to at least postpone any action beyond this year. Brian Hook, the USA State Department official responsible for the talks, appears optimistic (https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/03/21/us/politics/21reuters-iran-usa-nuclear.html). Overall I put the chance of USA exiting the deal at 25%. Iran exiting seems unlikely. From their perspective very little has changed and they appear to be trying to show confidence in the deal: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-pompeo-iran/iran-plays-down-potential-impact-of-pompeo-appointment-on-nuclear-deal-idUSKCN1GQ1P3 Overall, I estimate a 30% chance of the deal breaking down. If the deal breaks down, then there is the chance of military action. The most likely scenario however, at least initially, appears to be the reinstation of the Obama-era sanctions. This seems to be the scenario the USA establishment is preparing for and presumably there would be resistance within the military complex to interventation. I would put the chance of military conflict in the 7.5 months between mid-May and end of year (assuming the agreement breaks down) at only 15%.\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/josh-rogin/wp/2018/03/20/what-happens-the-day-after-trump-pulls-out-of-the-iran-deal/?utm_term=.9d5eb866269d\nhttps://foreignpolicy.com/2017/08/31/what-would-u-s-withdrawal-from-the-iran-nuclear-deal-look-like/\nhttps://fivethirtyeight.com/features/four-ways-trump-could-dump-the-iran-nuclear-agreement/"], [32078, "2018-03-31T17:43:39Z", [0.15], ""], [57399, "2018-03-31T17:19:36Z", [0.03], ""], [57390, "2018-03-31T17:09:56Z", [0.05], ""], [55331, "2018-03-31T16:10:44Z", [0.03], ""], [593, "2018-03-31T14:06:23Z", [0.05], ""], [57368, "2018-03-31T05:50:49Z", [0.1], "That depends on Jon Bolton and if Trump listens to him.

Would a lethal confrontation be a one-on-one military engagement directly between Iran and U.S.A, or can a lethal confrontation also entail proxy warfare? This is important to distinguish because if we are to operate under the assumption that proxy conflicts can be considered a lethal confrontation, then this has already happened. For instance, while U.S troops have killed pro-Assad Russian mercenaries, a U.S and Israel coalition also targeted Hezbollah forces in Syria after Israel captured an Iranian drone. However, taking it a step further, one can also make the case that Iran was indirectly targeted in this situation as well due to Hezbollah receiving training, weapons, and financial support from Iran (in other words, it was a U.S led coalition versus and Iranian one). \n          Despite a real possibility of a lethal confrontation occurring, I think there is only a 30% chance that it will happen due to each country being very wary of their situations in Syria. Moreover, I would put the percentage of a direct conflict any higher due to Russia's role in Syria. Russia at the moment has arguably played much more of an active role than Iran. Therefore, naturally that chances of a U.S lethal confrontation will be higher with whoever is heading the opposition.\nhttps://www.vox.com/world/2018/2/13/17008446/us-troops-syria-russia-mercenaries-killed\n"], [57092, "2018-03-27T16:13:47Z", [0.15], "Trump and administration more focused on North Korea..

I analyse the four factors that must be present for preventative war to occur. This is because:\n1. Any perceived rises in Iran's capabilities are not believed to be inexorable as there is every possibility that Iran's nuclear programme can shift from weapons-driven to energy-driven as the Uranium enrichment process requires the same technology. Therefore the effect of this factor would make preventative war less likely. 2. The power transition that would occur if Iran became nuclear capable would be significant as they would then have a small scale form of nuclear deterrence against the USA. The effects of this factor would then make a preventative war more likely. 3. The adversary of the US (Iran) is indeed implacably hostile towards the US. This is due to the anti-western/ anti-imperialist nature of the Iranian regime born from US interference in Iranian politics prior to the 1979 Revolution. Further, Iran's top rival in the middle-east (Israel) is the US's strongest ally in the region. 4. Does the adversary engages in highly provocative actions? While relations remain tense, provocative actions are roughly equal between the dyad as the Trump administration asserts that Iran is one of their highest security concerns. Small standoffs continue in the Strait of Hormuz and Iran even shot some CIA drones down over Iranian airspace in 2011/12. There is very minute evidence of provocative actions between the rival states so this factor should not increase the likelihood of a preventative war from the USA.

Yes, ISIS was on the way to defeat as a conventional fighting force\u2013but the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad, backed by Russia and Iran, controlled more than half of the country.

What began as a civil uprising seven year ago now looks more like an international conflict where patron states are replacing their proxies. Since Feb. 3, the aircraft of four different countries have been downed over Syria. A Russian jet was hit by Syrian opposition fighters. Turkey says Kurdish fighters shot down one of its helicopters. An Israeli F-16 was downed by the Syrian regime after the jet carried out raids in Syria. And Israel says it shot down an Iranian drone entering Israeli space from Syria. On top of this, U.S. forces clashed with Russian mercenary forces who had attacked Kurdish forces backed by the U.S (para. 1-3). Collard, R. (2018).

I assume that basic risk management would lead both sides to be cautious of unsettling the other, especially while the hard-won deal is still unsettled and our relationship is so new.  If our economic ties to Iran were as strong and settled as they are with other Gulf states (e.g. Saudi Arabia), we would not need to be as cautious about offending one another.  But we would also be unlikely to enter into direct confrontation.  Both Iran and Saudi Arabia have a troubling history of funding terrorists, but Saudi Arabia at least has security and economic agreements with the US that make it unlikely to act directly against us.  Iran,  like many states, would prefer to rely on its own military deterrence power, but is tempted by the riches of global economic participation and foreign investment.   Iran needs to have more economic reliance on the US and other foreign investors to further reduce the risk of direct confrontation.

Mr. Tillerson on Wednesday said the U.S. will reinvigorate diplomatic efforts and maintain U.S. troops in Syria for the foreseeable future as part of a new focus on countering Iran, as well as pursuing overall political stability in the country. The Trump administration wants to be engaged in Syria as the threat from Iran rises and Islamic State recedes, he said (para. 1-3).\nHis speech was followed by a question-and-answer session moderated by former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who is a Stanford professor. Mr. Tillerson arrived in California one day after a meeting in Vancouver, British Columbia, with senior officials from 20 countries to discuss strengthening the implementation of sanctions against North Korea (para. 7). In all, Mr. Tillerson outlined \u201cfive key end states\u201d that the Trump administration is seeking in Syria: preventing new threats from Islamic State and al Qaeda; supporting a U.N.-led process to transition away from the leadership of Mr. Assad; reducing Iran\u2019s influence in Syria; creating conditions so that Syrian refugees can safely and voluntarily return to their country; and ensuring that Syria is free of weapons of mass destruction (para 12). The U.S. will pursue \u201cstabilization initiatives in liberated areas,\u201d such as clearing unexploded land mines planted by Islamic State and helping reopen hospitals and schools, Mr. Tillerson said. However, he said the U.S. won\u2019t aid reconstruction in territory controlled by Mr. Assad\u2019s regime. \u201cThe United States, the EU and regional partners will not provide international reconstruction assistance to any area under control of the Assad regime,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said. \u201cWe ask all stakeholders in Syria\u2019s future to do the same.\u201d That stance is likely to put the U.S. at odds with Russia, a key supporter of Mr. Assad\u2019s (para. 12-15).

It is fairly easy to see a scenario where US troops attack an area in any of those places, intending to kill IS fighters, and accidentally hits an Iranian advisor, or vice versa. Additionally, since the navies of both countries patrol the waters around the Strait of Hormuz, and have recorded dozens of close call naval incidents in the past couple of years, sometimes resulting in warning shots being fired, I think it's unlikely, but not extremely unlikely that a deadly kinetic action could occur there. Another factor I'm monitoring is lack of popularity of the regimes in both countries, with popularity having a roughly negative correlation with a regime's desire to start a war and start a \"rally around the flag\" effect.

He also has a penchant for surprise departures from previous standard US foreign policies and has spoken out against Iran and the Iran nuclear deal.

In the intervening time, I can't find reference to any lethal confrontations between US and Iranian military forces.   There have been plenty of direct confrontations though.  None have ended up with a fatality. So, the question is will 2018 produce the first lethal confrontation in almost 40 years. How would it happen if it was to happen?  First, our forces would have to be in close enough proximity to physically hurt each other.  The US does have a lot of bases encircling Iran.  Here's a link to a map showing US military bases/presence near Iran:  http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/interactive/2012/04/2012417131242767298.html Most of those bases have been there a long time though and have yet to produce a fatal confrontation.   Yes, tensions are high.  But, tensions have been higher before (think Hostage Crisis and two shooting wars - Kuwait and Iraq - in neighboring countries) and still no lethal confrontations.  So what could ignite a lethal confrontation?  The Eurasia group recently published a paper (https://www.eurasiagroup.net/issues/top-risks-2018)  that provides some relevant information.  They call out one specific instance that applies to this question... It's in Syria.   Both countries have forces on the ground (not just proxy fighters but enlisted military) in that country.  However, they appear to be fighting in different theaters of operation.  I'm not sure that either side would deliberately target the other sides forces in Syria.  Again, both sides have had boots on the ground for some time without lethal results.  Is that careful planning or just luck?  Could a stray bullet, mistaken targeting of missile or air strike kill someone?  Sure. But, I think the forces need to be closer to each other and/or fighting over the exact same territory/objective to increase the probability of that happening.   If a lethal confrontation occurs, I believe it's most likely to happen where the US and Iran have tangled before.   That's in the Strait of Hormuz.   The US is committed to keeping these sea lanes open.  And, the Iranian navy operates in that area also.  An area ripe for an accident. Why an accident?  It seems there have been reported confrontations between both navies virtually every year since the Iranian Revolution.  The Iranian Navy even captured 10 US servicemen in 2016.   Yet, never a fatality.   Seems they're very good at shooting at each and missing...on purpose.   Someday, one of those shots will go awry and actually hit a person.   What could change over the year?  Several things could increase tensions in the area.  President Trump could unilaterally scrap the Iran Nuclear deal.  Iran could send in military \"advisors\" to the Yemeni Houthi rebels.  Saudi Arabian Crown Prince could ignite a conflict with Iran that drags the US, as his ally, into shooting range.   Could these scenarios decrease the distance between militaries?  More units closer to each other would increase the probabilities for me.  There is one other scenario that I'm thinking through.  The US has identified Iran as a State Sponsor of Terrorism.  If there was a terrorist attack that was unequivocally attributed to Iran - or Iranian influence - the US may launch a cruise missile strike/drone strike on those terrorists/terrorist locations.  Iranian military may be embedded with those terrorists and could die in that possible retaliation.  I don't think it would stop President Trump from ordering retaliation even if the base/location was in Iran proper.  All this being said, I think the probability of any of these scenarios is low.   The US and Iran have been enemies a long time without killing each other.   They'll continue to antagonize each other but barring accident, I don't see a purposeful lethal confrontation coming."], [47331, "2018-01-07T19:04:14Z", [0.04], ""], [47325, "2018-01-07T19:03:57Z", [0.0], ""], [47312, "2018-01-07T19:03:46Z", [0.03], ""], [47315, "2018-01-07T19:03:45Z", [0.0], ""], [47306, "2018-01-07T19:02:51Z", [0.02], ""], [47320, "2018-01-07T19:02:11Z", [0.0], ""], [47018, "2018-01-07T19:00:52Z", [0.17], ""], [47309, "2018-01-07T19:00:45Z", [0.05], ""], [47277, "2018-01-07T18:58:08Z", [0.65], "Sabre rattling may very well result in a very limited confrontation on the Strait of Hormuz.

More critical could get the situation in the Persian Gulf where tensions could rise in 2018 after the situation in Iraq/Syria is settled to some degree. Thus, encounters are not unlikely even though none of the parties have an interest in letting it become lethal.  The central question for me then is: What could lead either of the parties to risk such a confrontation?\nUnfortunately my knowledge about Iran is somewhat limited. Clearly, there is the conflict between Saudis and Iranians mainly based on the shia/sunni divide as well as geopolitics (control, influence, economic interests). However, neither of them can be interested in an open military confrontation at the moment. The consequences for the whole region would be severe. Furthermore it would contradict longterm US interests.  Still, US politics and interests after the Obama administration are not as predictable as they have been. External conflicts with other states have increased since Trump took office - at least rhetorically. There is the Iran nuclear deal that might get under scrutiny in the next months if the US imposes new sanctions on Iran. Moreover, there is the conflict in Yemen that has so far risen from one escalation level to another and might severe tensions. Additionally, there is the the Arab divide. Last but not least, internal matters could put further pressure on Trump, especially concerning the midterm elections in 2018 and the presidential elections in 2020. An external confrontation could help him to get the support he needs by the American people.
