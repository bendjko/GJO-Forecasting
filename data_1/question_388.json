If the ruling is challenged, a majority would be required to overturn it. If the ruling is upheld, it becomes a precedent. This would end what had effectively become a 60-vote requirement for confirmation of an executive or judicial nominee, or the passage of legislation.\" Good summary and link here: https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/478098. Could get more interesting than I anticipated just one short day ago. Back to a Big E 88(%). From 538 post in comment I linked above: \"But the Gorsuch confirmation could still all fall apart. Since Vice President Mike Pence can cast a tie-breaking vote, Republicans need at least 50 of their 52 members to support changing the rules for Supreme Court nominees.

However, the Senate is in recess from the 10th-21st leaving only a little over two weeks to get Gorsuch confirmed. If GOP fails next week, changing the rules will be the first priority, and could be done before April 10th, followed by a simple majority vote after the recess.

I found this in wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filibuster_in_the_United_States_Senate \"In many cases, an objection to a request for unanimous consent will compel a vote. While forcing a single vote may not be an effective delaying tool, the cumulative effect of several votes, which take at least 15 minutes apiece, can be substantial. In addition to objecting to routine requests, senators can force votes through motions to adjourn and through quorum calls. Quorum calls are meant to establish the presence or absence of a constitutional quorum, but senators routinely use them to waste time while waiting for the next speaker to come to the floor or for leaders to negotiate off the floor. In those cases, a senator asks for unanimous consent to dispense with the quorum call. If another senator objects, the clerk must continue to call the roll of senators, just as they would with a vote. If a call shows no quorum, the minority can force another vote by moving to request or compel the attendance of absent senators. Finally, senators can force votes by moving to adjourn, or by raising specious points of order and appealing the ruling of the chair. \"The most effective methods of delay are those that force the majority to invoke cloture multiple times on the same measure. The most common example is to filibuster the motion to proceed to a bill, then filibuster the bill itself. This forces the majority to go through the entire cloture process twice in a row. If, as is common, the majority seeks to pass a substitute amendment to the bill, a further cloture procedure is needed for the amendment. My conclusion is that so long as Democrats vote as a united block, they've got the upper-hand. Since it is widely assumed that Gorsuch will eventually win approval and there's really no hurry right now, what incentive is there for McConnell to go nuclear and change the rules?  Wouldn't it be far wiser and better  for him to work on flipping 8 Democrats?  There will be plenty of opportunities to make deals with individual Democrats as legislation comes to the floor in coming weeks and months;  I can see a Democrat agreeing to vote for cloture/Gorsuch in exchange for something in the tax bill, for example.

Second, the Republicans are united in their support for Gorsuch, and some Democrats (Manchin (WV), Heitcamp (ND), King (ME)) have said they would not be against an up or down vote.

Looking back at the information I have previously posted about how decisions can be delayed (and I think the Democrats will want to do that in this case because  Republicans delayed the hearing of Garland for months)  I read: Withholding consent is a sure way for Democrats to slow or stop Mr. Trump. Want to force committees to adjourn? Refuse consent when the leader wants to waive the rule that prevents committees from meeting beyond the first two hours of a Senate day. Want to delay votes for 30 hours? Refuse consent. If Democrats make sure to always have a senator available to dissent and Republicans don\u2019t retaliate by adjusting chamber rules, such tactics can potentially secure concessions. \"A single objection forces the majority leader to seek cloture \u2014 a cumbersome, multiday process culminating in a vote to cut off debate with the support of 60 senators. With a Republican bench of 52 senators, eight Democrats would have to cross the aisle to achieve cloture. Even then, unless all senators agree to waive their rights to more debate, 30 hours of post-cloture debate ensues. Senators can also threaten to filibuster amendments and other motions. So long as 41 Democrats stick together, they can force Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, to slog through cloture repeatedly on just a single bill. And every time Democrats force Republicans to find 60 votes, they make it harder for Republicans to advance other parts of their plan.

He refused to answer. I asked him if he agreed with conservative lawyers who say the president has abused executive power. He refused to answer. I asked him whether he thought the president\u2019s comments on voter fraud would undermine our democracy. He refused to answer. I asked him about landmark cases like Citizens United and Bush v. Gore. He refused to answer. Since he claims to be an originalist, I asked him about his view of what the framers intended with the Emoluments Clause in our Constitution. \"He refused to answer any of these questions. He told me he couldn\u2019t give me his view of any case, past or present, or any constitutional principle, because it might bias him. This blanket excuse frustrates any examination of what kind of judge the nominee will be. As the conservative icon Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote, \u201cProof that a justice\u2019s mind at the time he joined the court was a complete tabula rasa in the area of constitutional adjudication would be evidence of lack of qualification, not lack of bias.\u201d \"Without any hints about his philosophy or examples of how he might have ruled on landmark cases, the only way that Judge Gorsuch was able to demonstrate his independence as a jurist was by asserting it himself. He could give no evidence of it in his record, and therefore I could have no assurance of it in the future. \"As I sat with Judge Gorsuch, a disconcerting feeling came over me that I had been through this before \u2014 and I soon realized I had, with Judge John G. Roberts Jr. He was similarly charming, polished and erudite. Like Neil Gorsuch, he played the part of a model jurist. And just like Neil Gorsuch, he asserted his independence, claiming to be a judge who simply called \u201cballs and strikes,\u201d unbiased by both ideology and politics. \"When Judge Roberts became Justice Roberts, we learned that we had been duped by an activist judge. The Roberts court systematically and almost immediately shifted to the right, violating longstanding precedent with its rulings in Citizens United and in Shelby v. Holder, which gutted the Voting Rights Act. Before Justice Scalia died, the court was on the precipice of violating precedent again with Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, which would have eviscerated unions. In each instance, there was an attempt to tilt the scales of justice in favor of big business or right-leaning interests. Rather than calling balls and strikes, Chief Justice Roberts was a 10th player, shifting the power structure toward the privileged and away from the average American. \"The overarching lesson of Chief Justice Roberts can be summed up in a familiar phrase: Fool me once, shame on them; fool me twice, shame on me. \"Judge Gorsuch\u2019s behind-closed-doors admission that he felt \u201cdisheartened\u201d by President Trump\u2019s attacks on judges could well be akin to Judge Roberts\u2019s \u201cballs and strikes.\u201d Judge Gorsuch told it to me in private; when Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and I asked him to say it in public, he refused. Clearly he wanted this to be seen as a marker of his independence, because his handlers immediately told us, \u201cYou can tell this to the press.\u201d A truly independent judge would have the fortitude to condemn the president\u2019s remarks, not just express disapproval, and to do it publicly. The White House\u2019s assertion that Judge Gorsuch\u2019s private remarks were not aimed at Mr. Trump only raises concerns about his independence. \"My fellow senators should know that Judge Gorsuch was eerily similar to Judge Roberts.

The majority leader routinely seeks unanimous consent on procedural matters, meaning that one senator can temporarily block the majority. . . . withholding consent is a sure way for Democrats to slow or stop Mr. Trump. Want to force committees to adjourn? Refuse consent when the leader wants to waive the rule that prevents committees from meeting beyond the first two hours of a Senate day. Want to delay votes for 30 hours? Refuse consent. If Democrats make sure to always have a senator available to dissent and Republicans don\u2019t retaliate by adjusting chamber rules, such tactics can potentially secure concessions. \"A single objection forces the majority leader to seek cloture \u2014 a cumbersome, multiday process culminating in a vote to cut off debate with the support of 60 senators. With a Republican bench of 52 senators, eight Democrats would have to cross the aisle to achieve cloture. Even then, unless all senators agree to waive their rights to more debate, 30 hours of post-cloture debate ensues. Senators can also threaten to filibuster amendments and other motions. So long as 41 Democrats stick together, they can force Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, to slog through cloture repeatedly on just a single bill. And every time Democrats force Republicans to find 60 votes, they make it harder for Republicans to advance other parts of their plan. \"Democrats have an even more powerful arrow in their parliamentary quiver. Most times, senators can offer unrelated amendments to bills under debate, affording Democrats the chance to create discord among Republicans and between Republican senators and the White House. Debating a bill to deregulate Wall Street? Offer an amendment to reject the president\u2019s order banning refugees and immigrants from entering the country. A bill to loosen limits on offshore oil drilling? Propose an amendment to prevent the president from lifting sanctions on Russia. \"Senator McConnell can block votes on such amendments only if he also curtails Republican amendments. So Democrats are likely to secure votes on at least some of their proposals that might force Republicans to take sides. \"Exploiting these Senate rules empowers Democrats to change the subject, signal resistance to their party base and perhaps change voters\u2019 minds. Whether or not their tactics ultimately prevent proposals from going forward, Democrats force Republicans to own Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda by casting controversial votes \u2014 a move that could come back to haunt Republicans in the next election. \"Such tools are of more limited value when it comes to blocking confirmation of presidential appointees. Having banned the filibuster of most judicial and executive branch nominees in 2013, Democrats can slow down nominations, but can\u2019t derail them without Republican defections. Nonetheless, delay eats up floor time and shines a spotlight on nominees Democrats oppose. \"Senators can still filibuster confirmation votes for Supreme Court nominees, a tactic Democrats are debating now that Mr. Trump has nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch to fill Antonin Scalia\u2019s seat. Some Democrats seem inclined to allow a vote since the confirmation would simply replace one conservative justice with another. Filibustering also increases the risk that Republicans will do away with Supreme Court filibusters altogether, which they could do with a simple majority vote. \"Democrats are no strangers to exploiting Senate rules, having used such tactics occasionally during the George W. Bush years. Republicans, however, fully weaponized Senate rules by routinely deploying them against President Obama and the Democrats. Americans would know that there was a great debate going on, Senator McConnell reasoned, only if Republicans refused to sign on to Democratic proposals. \"These tactics could backfire and provoke Republicans to ban filibusters [aka \"the nuclear option\"]. But senators\u2019 power \u2014 majority and minority alike \u2014 flows from the chamber\u2019s lax rules. There is no guarantee that a majority would vote to curtail filibusters. The Senate\u2019s 60-vote rule also allows Republicans to blame Democrats for blocking more controversial parts of the Trump agenda. \"Still, Democrats should take the lesson of the Republicans\u2019 years in the minority to heart. Majorities are more often blamed for inaction than minorities are held accountable for blocking them. If Democrats adopt the Republican playbook, Senate rules will largely work in their favor.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  Had this SCOTUS vacancy occurred in the last month prior to the election, or since, I personally would not support delaying tactics by Democrats.  But the vacancy occurred early in the last year of the Obama presidency, so I am of the opinion that Merrick Garland's nomination should have been voted on.  Given this, I think it is entirely appropriate for Democrats to not roll over on this nomination.  Gorsuch should be given \"extreme vetting\". With Trump's threat of \"see you in court\" in response to the 9th Circuit Appeals Court's decision to uphold the stay of his Executive Order on immigration, pressure may mount by Republican Senators to fill the vacancy ASAP, as it is assumed that with the current court the decision might be 4-4 which would allow the Appeals Court's decision to stand.   OTOH Senate Democrats may conclude for that reason that it is best to keep the seat vacant as long as possible, and put even more effort into delaying tactics.

However, I drop a few points because congress has a lot to deal with right now between healthcare reform, rewriting the tax code, and dealing with immigration proposals. With so much else taking up valuable congressional time its possible that supreme court nominee hearings are delayed or at least more spaced out than normal. Here's the data I used for this.

This suggests a raw (100/166=) 61% probability that this question will be resolved as \"Yes\". There are some refinements that makes sense to me: 7 of these nominees declined the position, however I believe (>99%) that Pres. Trump will not nominate anyone who would plausibly deny the seat, so I'll exclude these. Also, we know that the Senate and the President are of the same party, which was only true for 107 of these nominations, so I'll throw out the rest.

It seems the real question is: \"Will the Democrats be able to successfully be able to block Trump's SCOTUS nominees?\"  Since Ronald Reagan, 3 out of 15 nominees (20%) have been successfully blocked. Another 5 of 15 nominees (33.3%) were confirmed, but took more than 80 days to do so. That's a full 53.3% of past nominees that would be at significant risk of missing the time line (I'm assuming that if a nominees is rejected, there won't be enough time to nominate another one -- an assumption that I'm willing to stick with).  I still believe that Trump will nominate someone in the first week or two of February, as he prevoiusly claimed. From there, he would have 75-90 days to be confirmed before April 30th. Since the average is 67-71 days (depending on how you want to measure), it would indicate that a nominee would be confirmed by April 30th. BUT, I believe that this will likely be a polarizing SCOTUS pick (because of the Republican tactics with Merrick Garland) and that the Democrats will likely use similar tactic to delay, stall, or hobble the confirmation process.
