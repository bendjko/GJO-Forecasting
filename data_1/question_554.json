Dhingra's ten point win in the primary, and the national news shining poorly on republicans.\n(2) The fact that the seat was republican (tight races) for ten years.  In looking at Andy Hill's voting record he looked pretty moderate, sponsoring legislation so non-documented WA children could attend WA univerisites with in-state tuition & also voting in favor of significant gas taxes.  From what I can tell via J. Englund's platform, she may lean more Republican than A. Hill. These data sets combined make me fairly confident M.

This results in the following basic demographic table. Demographic: Population (Turnout) [%D] Non-Hispanic White: 104,203 (45.8%)  [39%]\nHispanic:                        12,930 (27.0%) [63%]\nAsian:                             17,449 (26.9%) [52%]\nBlack:                               1,660 (40.6%) [87%]\nSome Other Race:       10,238 (34.9%) [61%] Running the simulation results in a near ensured victory for Dhingra, and in many cases by a pretty sizable margin.
