The correct answer for this question is probably \"no\", but I'm leaning toward \"yes\" because of the company's announcement on January 4 that it is exploring a bankruptcy filing and because of the large numbers involved (an additional $15 billion according to Citigroup; PG&E's shareholder equity is only $19.4 billion according to YCharts https://ycharts.com/companies/PCG/shareholders_equity).  The NYT article bolsters this scenario.  PG&E said its liability insurance for the year that began Aug. 1 amounted to $1.4 billion.
