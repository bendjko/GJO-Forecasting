The relations between Germany and Turkey saw some improvements over the past months, which is indirectly evidenced by the fact that in the beginning of October Turkey allowed a delegation of German MPs to visit Incirlik military base, where Bundeswehr soldiers are serving. This decision was a result of lengthy negotiations between the German and the Turkish authorities, after which the official Berlin basically distanced itself from Bundestag resolution on \"Armenian genocide\", which angered Turkey, and in response the republic softened its position on the visit of a group of German parliamentarians to Incirlik. However, this period of mutual understanding between the two countries did not last for long. In late October Turkish authorities did not allow MPs from the 'Left' party to visit Incirlik military base, since this party is considered to be pro-Kurdish. This decision wasn't unreasonable, since many supporters of the 'Left' party clearly sympathize with left Marxist ideology of the PKK (para. 1-2). Sattarov, O. (2016).

The Commission has encouraged Turkey's efforts to complete the delivery of all the outstanding benchmarks on the Visa Liberalisation Roadmap as soon as possible. The Commission and Turkey have continued an engaged dialogue to find solutions, including the legislative and procedural changes needed on all the outstanding benchmarks.\n(End of Source) Of course, there is the sense that the EU does not want to allow Visa-free travel regardless of the benchmarks. I'd venture to say that not all EU members feel this way, but it seems reasonable some would.

COMMENT: Turkey is NOT responsible for either \"terrorist attacks\" in Nice nor, does it \"appear\"  the case in Munich  event this evening. http://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-crime-munich-idUSKCN1021YZ Terrorists are, however, responsible for Paris & Brussels & Nice events. ISIS claimed responsibility for Paris, Brussels & Nice. Munich is OPEN issue at this point. Authorities are still working on the issue this evening. NB: The TOTALITY of these events, however, simply add to, an already signicantly more crititical  \"ingrained negative European terrorism\" PSYCHOLOGY that, here in Europe has taken a \"FIRM HOLD\". Have mentioned this issue on OTHER related Q, which are indeed critical to resolution Qs. NB: the recent signicant surge in France of Marie Le Pen. These events merely play into the political hands of the Austrian Right Wing, German AfD or, Le Pen in France. Frankly, increasingly, the combined terrorist strategy to strike open public forums, which are in fact nearly indefensible, is having a very clear impact on political inclinations. NB: the emotional BREXIT campaign!  Is it any wonder DT in the U.S. plays to FEAR ? Emotion should not be under-estimated. In any event, common discussion here in EU ( Switzterland, as well) is: WHERE NOT to go on vacation. It has an impact on those where NOT to go to economies.  Much to the contrary, what has become increasingly clear is, RADICALIZED ideologies have taken a much more pro-active approach in an attempt to impact EU industries such as Tourism & the like this summer, successfully - at least as far as Turkey & Paris. Forget about Brussels.  And, the approach to \"mass murder\"  has taken advantage of innocent people enjoying either lives at theater in Paris, or traveling to the airport in Brussels or, now simply going to the shopping center in Munich. There is an clear ASYMMETRIC relationship btw all of theses events that impact upon one single Q. Are Europeans today prepared to lift visa requirements for Turkish citizens under the present geopolitical situation.  Post the events in Turkey this past week, Nice two weeks ago &, the multiple shootings in Munich this evening ( w/ as yet no confirmation of responsibility for attacks) it should come as no surprise that politicians, when given the opportunity to vote on lifting VISA requirements regime for Turkish citizens,  will clearly vote NOT to grant Turkey visa free passage UNLESS Turkey is willing capable of complying with the minimum objectives set out by the EU. A requirement, that post the failed Military Coup in Turkey, Erdogan will surely not comply with.   HOW the EU solves the Turkish immigration deal, will surely ratchet up the political disequilibrium that presently exists post BREXIT. Also, CRITICAL, is the Trojan horse deal Merkel forced through w/ Erdogan over the now \"stranded refugees/displaced individuals\" in Greece/Turkey. How this plays out w/in the next six months &, the impact upon EU immigration will create further disequilibrium.  http://en.trend.az/world/turkey/2561165.html \"...The European Parliament is expected to vote against granting a visa-free regime to Turkey in September due to the reaction of the country\u2019s authorities to the military coup attempt, a source in the European Parliament told RIA Novosti July 22...\""], [368, "2016-07-22T19:14:55Z", [0.0], ""], [27612, "2016-07-22T16:53:06Z", [0.0], ""], [11868, "2016-07-22T14:40:45Z", [0.0], ""], [19924, "2016-07-22T13:50:55Z", [0.05], ""], [27677, "2016-07-22T12:40:53Z", [0.05], ""], [3363, "2016-07-22T12:39:18Z", [0.02], ""], [27671, "2016-07-22T11:50:15Z", [0.0], ""], [27665, "2016-07-22T10:21:53Z", [0.0], ""], [83, "2016-07-22T00:27:53Z", [0.0], "EU waiting out Turkey's response to the coup.\nhttp://www.wsj.com/articles/sen-kaine-seen-as-clintons-vp-pick-1469144626"], [27585, "2016-07-21T21:23:40Z", [0.01], ""], [532, "2016-07-21T20:01:46Z", [0.0], ""], [38, "2016-07-21T18:09:12Z", [0.0], ""], [27098, "2016-07-21T17:41:42Z", [0.0], ""], [83, "2016-07-21T16:42:43Z", [0.0], "Need to see positive news before increasing forecast."], [368, "2016-07-21T16:35:03Z", [0.0], ""], [3895, "2016-07-21T15:31:50Z", [0.03], "can't say this is looking terribly likely now..."], [27613, "2016-07-21T15:11:48Z", [0.0], ""], [27552, "2016-07-21T14:55:21Z", [0.0], ""], [27601, "2016-07-21T07:53:26Z", [0.0], ""], [12943, "2016-07-21T07:38:46Z", [0.0], ""], [26241, "2016-07-21T07:01:50Z", [0.0], "after the declaration of the state of emergency in Turkey working on and solving  the five remaining topics on the agreed catalogue for lifting the visa requirements will not be high on the political agenda."], [27599, "2016-07-21T06:43:36Z", [0.02], ""], [27599, "2016-07-21T06:38:32Z", [0.05], ""], [13465, "2016-07-21T05:32:44Z", [0.0], ""], [14432, "2016-07-21T04:51:05Z", [0.0], ""], [26991, "2016-07-21T00:46:36Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2016-07-20T21:50:48Z", [0.0], ""], [13364, "2016-07-20T21:25:59Z", [0.0], ""], [15548, "2016-07-20T18:02:01Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-07-20T16:22:54Z", [0.01], ""], [10898, "2016-07-20T09:30:39Z", [0.0], ""], [5386, "2016-07-20T06:30:19Z", [0.0], ""], [176, "2016-07-20T04:25:36Z", [0.0], ""], [27128, "2016-07-19T21:10:34Z", [0.0], ""], [27004, "2016-07-19T20:23:56Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2016-07-19T19:46:31Z", [0.0], ""], [23409, "2016-07-19T19:45:25Z", [0.03], ""], [27461, "2016-07-19T19:21:14Z", [0.0], "The two sides are steadily drifting apart.
