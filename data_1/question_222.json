The United States has accused Russia of violating the deal multiple times, including by deploying a nuclear-tipped cruise missile.\nThe NDAA would address Russia\u2019s violations of the INF Treaty by authorizing $58 million to respond to the violations, including with research and development of a U.S. ground-launched cruise missile system.\nBut the ban on funding to extend New START was taken out.\nA separate provision that was also in the House-passed bill was retained. That provision would require the president to give Congress a plan to address any potential failure of Russia to comply with the treaty by the 2018 deadline, including a look at potential sanctions, diplomacy or redeployment of U.S. nuclear forces beyond New START levels.\nThe NDAA conference report said that negotiators remain \u201cfrustrated\u201d with Russia\u2019s violations of the INF Treaty.\n\u201cAs the expiration date of the New START Treaty approaches,\u201d the report said, \u201cthe conferees urge the president and the members of the National Security Council to carefully consider whether extending the treaty, if Russia is still in violation of the INF Treaty, is in the national interest of the United States.\u201d Affirming forecast.\n\n "], [14166, "2017-11-12T12:03:41Z", [0.01], ""], [1034, "2017-11-12T05:02:59Z", [0.0], ""], [35398, "2017-11-12T01:58:44Z", [0.0], ""], [191, "2017-11-11T23:09:07Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-11-11T19:51:34Z", [0.0], ""], [20156, "2017-11-11T15:13:11Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-11-10T18:09:35Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-11-10T16:36:08Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-11-10T02:15:01Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-11-09T17:39:34Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-11-08T20:30:43Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-11-07T19:32:46Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-11-06T19:30:39Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-11-05T22:58:35Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-11-05T05:56:28Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-11-04T06:09:15Z", [0.0], ""], [12302, "2017-11-04T00:31:29Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-11-03T17:51:52Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-11-03T15:22:29Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-11-03T05:43:13Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-11-02T17:57:55Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-11-02T17:46:47Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-11-02T05:06:46Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-11-01T22:14:46Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-11-01T18:35:59Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-11-01T05:35:28Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-10-31T22:33:04Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-10-31T19:03:33Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-10-31T06:14:46Z", [0.0], ""], [6303, "2017-10-31T03:59:28Z", [0.0], "Based on general news and GJP consensus."], [368, "2017-10-30T22:23:20Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-10-30T04:42:46Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-10-29T17:53:49Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-10-29T12:53:34Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-10-29T05:56:49Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-10-29T02:11:01Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-10-28T05:06:00Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-10-27T20:39:35Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-10-27T19:51:39Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-10-27T14:52:44Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-10-26T20:13:16Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-10-26T18:28:41Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-10-26T06:14:26Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-10-25T23:58:25Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-10-25T17:44:01Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-10-25T15:07:54Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-10-24T20:25:23Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-10-24T19:33:45Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-10-24T01:12:28Z", [0.0], ""], [6303, "2017-10-23T04:06:07Z", [0.0], "Based on general news and GJP consensus."], [1034, "2017-10-22T23:21:35Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-10-22T18:42:04Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-10-21T21:49:55Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-10-21T20:17:49Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-10-21T19:16:10Z", [0.0], ""], [28414, "2017-10-21T16:36:08Z", [0.0], ""], [28414, "2017-10-21T16:24:50Z", [0.1], ""], [28414, "2017-10-21T15:33:42Z", [0.17], "Snap..."], [368, "2017-10-20T23:23:56Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-10-20T19:29:05Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-10-20T05:29:09Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-10-19T22:36:08Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-10-19T13:17:13Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-10-18T21:08:15Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-10-18T19:10:35Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-10-17T20:14:57Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-10-16T21:39:27Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-10-16T12:46:00Z", [0.0], ""], [6303, "2017-10-16T03:40:07Z", [0.0], "Based on general news and GJP consensus."], [691, "2017-10-15T23:29:06Z", [0.0], ""], [755, "2017-10-15T21:51:07Z", [0.01], "Comments: In compliance (maybe). \nThe Independent Barents Observer, October 4, 'Russia is close to fulfill New START Treaty - Since July, Russia\u2019s strategic nuclear force is reduced by 204 warheads.

Forget the S-500, the S-400 SAM system already poses a significant challenge to contemporary fourth-generation fighters. The Iskander ballistic missile could hit European capitals from the Russian enclave in Kaliningrad. The Kaliber cruise missile is a combat-tested as Tomahawk-equivalent, and comes in a deadly anti-ship variant which the Russian Navy has installed on small corvette-sized ships, giving them heavier armament than anything on the U.S. Navy\u2019s frigate-sized Littoral Combat Ships. And of course, Russia\u2019s nuclear ballistic missile arsenal remains the underlying concern in any clash with Moscow, regardless of its conventional forces.\" \"Meanwhile, investments in numerous next-generation weapons program suggest that Moscow is interested more in developing new technologies for tomorrow rather than today\u2014without committing to full-scale production to replace its huge arsenal of Cold War-era tanks and jets. This might explain why there are apparently more than a half-dozen fighter jets currently either in development or in limited scale production, and three or four new families of APCs slated for deployment, albeit sharing the same turret in common. The Russian defense establishment apparently prefers to diversify its options rather than concentrate on maximizing short-term production.\nThose technologies may eventually come to fruition at some point in the next decade, if and when Moscow has more disposable money and industrial capacity, and feels an urgent need to ramp up production. In response, those new systems may merit some modest adjusting of goal posts for the next generation of Western military technology. But one hundred tanks with unmanned turrets and twelve stealth fighters will not alter the military balance any time soon, and observers shouldn\u2019t let state-sponsored hype achieves its purpose by causing them to overestimate Russia\u2019s conventional military capabilities.\" Affirming forecast."], [1034, "2017-09-10T04:03:10Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-09-10T03:59:17Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-09-09T20:23:38Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-09-09T00:02:09Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-09-08T18:37:47Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-09-08T11:29:03Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-09-07T23:41:43Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-09-07T18:22:55Z", [0.0], ""], [31238, "2017-09-07T18:06:45Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-09-07T05:44:15Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-09-06T20:40:35Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-09-06T17:59:49Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-09-06T06:32:59Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-09-05T18:10:35Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-09-05T12:21:23Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-09-05T06:13:39Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-09-04T21:35:12Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-09-04T12:08:59Z", [0.0], ""], [6303, "2017-09-04T05:17:40Z", [0.0], "Based on general news and GJP consensus."], [368, "2017-09-03T19:29:44Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-09-03T17:13:01Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-09-03T06:52:21Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-09-03T01:40:30Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-09-02T13:48:26Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-09-02T07:15:10Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-09-01T19:56:30Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-09-01T13:51:14Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-09-01T05:19:35Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-08-31T23:11:17Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-08-31T16:31:34Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-08-31T10:15:19Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-08-30T19:13:16Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-08-30T17:30:07Z", [0.0], ""], [32122, "2017-08-30T13:42:21Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-08-30T05:53:17Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-08-29T19:59:02Z", [0.0], ""], [1333, "2017-08-29T17:39:46Z", [0.01], ""], [1993, "2017-08-29T06:52:47Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-08-28T16:32:13Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-08-28T16:14:48Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-08-28T05:08:26Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-08-27T20:39:22Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-08-27T12:16:41Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-08-26T20:30:12Z", [0.0], ""], [755, "2017-08-26T20:19:41Z", [0.01], "Comments: On ground and in air, tactical moves to attain strategic objectives.

I have a bone to pick with it, however.  I strongly object to the use of the term CA/IO, not that it is wholly unwarranted.  The United States has not just hamstrung itself, it has castrated itself with the creation and expansion of covert action restrictions.  These restrictions exist in no other country in the world, including among the FVEY partners.  Those in and out of government who hate CIA more than they love America have gleefully subjected the USIC to 'rules of engagement' and ill-defined 'American values' limitations on the offensive use of Information Operations on our enemies (except where lethal or propaganda CA authorities exist).  Adm. Rogers testified to this recently, when he said even Cyber Command was not postured to conduct CNA.  We are talking strategic not tactical, and degrading not collecting, enemy capability by using IO to project a message and attack foreign govt and military networks.  The Soviet Union was dissolved but the Cold War never ended.  Putin was the head of FSB before he was President, and 2PLA was busy assaulting our govt, mil and commercial infrastructure while we fixated on CT and climate change.\nDan's bio, Cipher Brief: https://www.thecipherbrief.com/expert/Dan-Harris Comments: RU is using CA/IO [as a force multiplier] and, gosh darn, it's paid HUGE dividends.

Rajaratnam School of International Studies. But while the Kremlin is prioritizing the development of new nuclear weapons as competition in the conventional arms race speeds up, Moscow is also pursuing its own military innovations albeit on a smaller scale.\n\u201cRussian responses to counter these initiatives consist of two major elements: The first one is \u2018countering the Third Offset Strategy with the First Offset Strategy\u2019, which means prioritising the development of a wide array of both strategic and tactical nuclear weapons systems,\u201d wrote Michael Raska, a professor at IDSS, and Vasily Kashin, a senior research fellow in the Institute of Far Eastern Studies in the Russian Academy of Sciences. \u201cFor Russia, maintaining a sophisticated arsenal of nuclear weapons can effectively offset conventional military innovations of the U.S., NATO, and China. The second element of the response strategy is more ambitious, and carries greater technological risks. Russia began to counter many U.S. technological initiatives via similar indigenous programs, although more narrowly focused and smaller in scale.\u201d Washington Times (opinion), May 10, 'The proliferating ballistic missile threat - Challenges from rogue regimes require rapid upgrades to the U.S. defensive shield': http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/may/10/missile-threats-abound-from-rogue-states/\nClips from Times article: \n\"Today\u2019s reality is sobering. A global power exchange of ICBMs is unacceptable, albeit remote. But a post Sept. 11 world makes the threat from ICBM attack more likely from rogue or failed nations and terror-sponsored entities than superpowers. The tactics and strategies of the past, mutual nuclear posturing, de-escalation and negotiation, play a lesser role while the successful ability to intercept and defeat a single or small ICBM attack is paramount.\nThe key United States missile defense relies on a few dozen ground-based interceptors in California and Alaska. The capabilities of these systems have grown over the last two decades, but system performance and aging technology require that constant evolution continue. Moreover, recent events in North Korea and Iran demand that attention be paid to the very real and present dangers posed by these nations, their cooperation, and the groups they associate with.\nAny national security strategist will opine that risk assessment is a product of threat assessment and vulnerability to that threat, and that threat is a function of capability and intent. It is not difficult to see that North Korea and Iran pose very dangerous threats, and that our current missile defense capability must continue to keep pace to mitigate the risk posed by these countries and possibly others.\"  Affirming forecast."], [1034, "2017-05-14T06:00:48Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-05-13T19:36:25Z", [0.0], ""], [14777, "2017-05-13T17:02:23Z", [0.04], ""], [35401, "2017-05-13T13:36:34Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-05-13T12:51:05Z", [0.01], ""], [1034, "2017-05-13T07:01:10Z", [0.0], ""], [35504, "2017-05-12T21:02:17Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-05-12T18:22:48Z", [0.0], ""], [1708, "2017-05-12T15:03:42Z", [0.05], ""], [1034, "2017-05-12T06:35:52Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-05-11T18:03:41Z", [0.0], ""], [30389, "2017-05-11T16:34:37Z", [0.05], ""], [16652, "2017-05-11T11:07:15Z", [0.01], ""], [1034, "2017-05-11T05:43:02Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-05-10T18:47:39Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-05-10T14:22:35Z", [0.01], ""], [16652, "2017-05-10T11:43:19Z", [0.01], ""], [1034, "2017-05-10T04:36:21Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-05-09T18:22:28Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-05-09T16:34:52Z", [0.01], ""], [601, "2017-05-09T14:54:37Z", [0.03], ""], [16652, "2017-05-09T07:54:37Z", [0.05], "Comment deleted on May 10, 2017 11:43AM UTC"], [1034, "2017-05-09T05:48:21Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-05-08T11:43:49Z", [0.01], ""], [1034, "2017-05-08T06:13:17Z", [0.0], ""], [34962, "2017-05-08T05:58:47Z", [0.03], ""], [368, "2017-05-07T19:30:09Z", [0.0], ""], [755, "2017-05-07T19:29:22Z", [0.02], "Affirming forecast."], [691, "2017-05-07T12:48:52Z", [0.01], ""], [1034, "2017-05-07T08:57:52Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-05-06T21:09:26Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-05-06T13:07:47Z", [0.01], ""], [1034, "2017-05-06T10:12:48Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-05-05T18:58:53Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-05-05T18:54:05Z", [0.01], ""], [691, "2017-05-04T22:22:34Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2017-05-04T13:50:53Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-05-03T23:13:09Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-05-03T19:57:09Z", [0.01], ""], [1034, "2017-05-03T06:43:13Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-05-02T20:22:59Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2017-05-02T19:07:51Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-05-02T05:58:59Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-05-01T17:24:41Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-05-01T05:41:12Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-04-30T14:10:35Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-04-30T12:43:36Z", [0.01], ""], [1034, "2017-04-30T06:40:02Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-04-29T19:19:07Z", [0.0], ""], [755, "2017-04-29T18:22:13Z", [0.02], "Washington Examiner, April 29, 'Russia weighs heavily in America's nuclear plans': http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/russia-weighs-heavily-in-americas-nuclear-plans/article/2621340 Proceedings (USNI), February 2017, 'Escalate to De-escalate': https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2017-02/escalate-de-escalate Comments: Russian Trump Card (so, sorry for this obvious play).

The fuze does this since it does not have fixed height-of-burst parameters \u2013 and instead adapts upon re-entry to almost ensure its greatest lethal payload is focused on the target below.\nInstead of needing three standard submarine-based missiles, then, destruction of a priority target would only take a single missile, writes Kristensen.\" \"The U.S. superiority is not necessarily good news for nuclear strategic stability, Kristensen writes. Russia is already in the process of testing a nuclear-powered underwater unmanned vehicle to threaten U.S. ports and coastal areas.

Trump also talked about his own popularity, the sources said.\nThe White House declined to comment. It referred Reuters to the official White House account issued after the Jan. 28 call, which did not mention the discussion about New START.\nIt has not been previously reported that Trump had conveyed his doubt about New START to Putin in the hour-long call.\nNew START gives both countries until February 2018 to reduce their deployed strategic nuclear warheads to no more than 1,550, the lowest level in decades. It also limits deployed land- and submarine-based missiles and nuclear-capable bombers.\nDuring a debate in the 2016 presidential election, Trump said Russia had \"outsmarted\" the United States with the treaty, which he called \"START-Up.\" He asserted incorrectly then that it had allowed Russia to continue to produce nuclear warheads while the United States could not.\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson said he supported the treaty during his Senate confirmation hearings.\nDuring the hearings Tillerson said it was important for the United States to \"stay engaged with Russia, hold them accountable to commitments made under the New START and also ensure our accountability as well\"(para. 1-9).

You must always remember this.\u201d There were three ways in which to respond. The first would be to believe that Putin would not allow the spring to snap back for fear of U.S. counteraction. Over the last two years, we have seen that Russia has taken the measure of U.S. deterrent and compellence capabilities, through constant probing and testing, and is assessing what it believes America\u2019s true red lines are\u2014not what is announced from the podiums of the White House and Foggy Bottom\u2014and sees no reason to completely forestall the springback. The second is to assess that the response of the Russian springback would be weak and ineffectual. It may be very true that the long-term trajectory of Russian power is negative and that the arc of history will bend in a way to consign the current Kremlin regime to the ashbin. But National Intelligence Council predictions about likely Russian futures in the 2030s is not a basis for conducting policy in 2016 on the basis of current, real, actual Russian capabilities today\u2014which, as operations in Syria and Ukraine and the reputed cyber intrusions have demonstrated\u2014are real.\"  The Daily Beast, October 6, 'Russia\u2019s Nuclear Surge: Putin Adding Nukes While Obama Cuts - Should we be worried that Moscow deployed 429 more warheads than Washington?

I'm still in the process of learning more about the subject area, but I've made enough progress that I'd like to update my forecast on this question.  I still think that the most likely impetus for the deterioration of US/Russian relations will be the Russian hacking of US electoral infrastructure. It's in the media, and it will need to be \"resolved\" in the media somehow. So: sticking with estimates that I provided on another GJ question:  25% - Russia fires some important people as a scapegoat for the DNC hacks, removing the need for the US to sanction the nation. (Or some other kind of diplomatic action-as-an-apology.) \n75% - the US sanctions Russia, demanding a Russian response  The update to my forecast comes from the fact that I more fully understand the various points of contact in the US/Russian relationship, and the fact that there are a large number of options that the Russians can use to signal it's ability to oppose US interests in the case that it decides to more aggressively oppose US interests.  Most importantly, I am considering the quote by \"Shestakov\" on the aforementioned class discussion forum: \"escalation is perceived proportional to the threat to the future of the country.\" Proportionality is a cornerstone of nuclear policy that touches all other types of policy, and control over internet communications does not seem like an existential threat to Russia or Russian interests. The US's position on cyber issues is being driven by it's interest in maintaining sovereignty over it's self-determination via the electoral process, which is not quite an existential threat, but it is close. Given the different levels of likely resolve, I am using the following probabilities as potential responses to US sanctions on Russia: ->  40% - Russia does it's diplomatic apology and relations turn back to 'normal' (waiting until after sanctions have been levied, allowing Putin to demonstrate internally that Putin will defend his friends.) \n-> 15% - Russian allies publicly move to Russian-hosted internet infrastructure. This will be difficult because it involves the creation of or increased support for Russian internet architecture, which is a difficult bit of internal politics and logistics to manage. However, it is more tit-for-tat-ish, considering the impetus of the deteriorating relationship. \n-> 35% - Russia increases territorial aggression and/or existing Russian allies make non-cyber moves away from the US and/or it's allies. This could be more likely depending on the type of sanctions the US imposes. \n-> 10% - Russia distances itself from the new START treaty That gives a 7.5% overall probability of Russian distancing itself from the START treaty. I'll round up to 8% just so that I can get slightly higher than the current consensus, for the sake of getting a little bit of numerical credit for my analysis.

For the former I lean toward something different even if it is hard to anticipate the immediate proximate causes; for the latter I seriously doubt there will be changes (but I've been mostly wrong about DT's campaign and a DT presidency would especially complicate what the policy wonks would recommend/expect). Until I revisit more seriously the issues I stand by my initial posts (this is the INF version): http://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/259258 Second is how one chooses to forecast with an eye toward the accuracy (or Brier if that is more one's thing) score. I can tell you have a very successful approach toward the second question. Then there is the \"guess the base rate\" approach or \"fifty-fifty\" as well as what others have shared. For these two questions I want to be higher than the consensus (still some question about what it actually is) for the INF and lower on New START (since the latter is so low anyway there isn't much wiggle room).

Extension - what is the root cause of all wars? Furthermore - what decides power of nations and blocs and nations and such? One answer - money.  What am I trying to say? Well, that Russia's economic might has declined substantially since 1990 is a fact proven beyond measure. While Glasnost and Perestroika were supposed to make Russia competitive in the global landscape once more, and economically strengthen the nation, it hasn't really happened. The major contributors today to the Russian economy are natural mines & minerals, and defence. What was it back in the time of Cold War? Same + much more within the USSR block. So what did opening up the economy really achieve? Much less than Gorbachev had hoped for. Now, the commodity downturn is further adding to the woes. So, basically the money is not flowing freely. What to do then? Can't flex the financial clout, so the way ahead looks bleak. Hence the show of strength, of military might, and more. Once Russia was the king of many, now it is the king of none, and definitely not even the #2 economy! Not even top 5 btw! So, can these murmurs increase? Yes, definitely. Will they? Low probability because the problems associated with getting back into the nuclearlization race are too high, but the economics for Russia not improving is not helping. The longer the situation sustains, the worse it will get. Oh btw, Russia already has too many trade sanctions on it from US and EU both - so not that it incrementally misses out on much by putting pressure back on nuclearlization! Maybe bullying can win it some victories again! Let me start with a low but meaningful probability of 20%. Sorry to be sounding like the doomsayer, but I genuinely think there is an issue here.
