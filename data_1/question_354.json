Health committee meetings going through 4 Oct [1], with possibly more to be scheduled. I think it's now pretty clear ( >95% chance) that this bill will not receive Royal Assent before November, and, very likely (>80% chance) that it doesn't happen before Christmas break either. The Senate is supposed to have its own committee hearings (probably in the committee of Social Affairs, Science and Technology), so if those are anything like these, expect big delays --- especially if they have amendments, which then get sent back to the House, etc. My postmortem: I started forecasting on this question back in early Dec 2016. I was never above 15%  at any point, and I definitely went below 10% back in Apr 2017. In the end the strongest signals for this question were simply the base rate for bill times to pass (easily found from the Canadian govt websites), adjusted for the complexity and impact / controversy for this particular bill, and of course the 3-month legislative summer break. I read a lot of other people's forecasts, and almost everyone who was too high seemed to have a good reason for why the bill will EVENTUALLY pass (which it probably will), while ignoring the deadline.

Once the committee is done its investigations, there is the report stage and third reading of the bill before they send it to the senate for Royal Assent before it can become law (repeating the same process as the house).  There is minimal chance of all of this happening over the course of 13 days (between Sept 18 and Oct 1), when the public is already concerned about them rushing the bill, and the Liberals having nothing to gain and everything to lose from pushing the process too fast. Besides, they're way ahead of their self-imposed July 1, 2018 deadline. Overall, 2% likelihood. 1. https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2017/05/28/canadians-worried-ottawa-rushing-into-pot-legalization-poll.html\n2. http://www.ourcommons.ca/Committees/en/HESA/StudyActivity?studyActivityId=9603581"], [14847, "2017-07-02T23:20:01Z", [0.17], ""], [368, "2017-07-02T22:46:03Z", [0.0], ""], [31317, "2017-07-02T21:04:10Z", [0.02], ""], [36281, "2017-07-02T20:01:56Z", [0.7], ""], [31238, "2017-07-02T18:20:40Z", [0.0], ""], [1092, "2017-07-02T17:57:20Z", [0.85], ""], [31679, "2017-07-02T14:01:59Z", [0.01], "Swayed by Pietrokc's analysis and information here: https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/526151"], [1034, "2017-07-02T07:46:33Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-07-01T18:25:23Z", [0.0], ""], [25646, "2017-07-01T16:55:54Z", [0.45], ""], [12828, "2017-07-01T14:54:43Z", [0.01], ""], [10898, "2017-07-01T14:47:48Z", [0.01], ""], [691, "2017-07-01T13:10:08Z", [0.01], ""], [36263, "2017-07-01T11:15:56Z", [0.85], ""], [20156, "2017-07-01T09:59:04Z", [0.35], ""], [1034, "2017-07-01T05:53:36Z", [0.0], ""], [14296, "2017-07-01T02:17:00Z", [0.1], ""], [368, "2017-07-01T00:25:11Z", [0.0], ""], [36255, "2017-06-30T16:18:05Z", [0.02], ""], [691, "2017-06-30T12:11:39Z", [0.01], ""], [1034, "2017-06-30T06:39:48Z", [0.0], ""], [9755, "2017-06-30T01:04:32Z", [0.05], ""], [36239, "2017-06-29T22:04:39Z", [0.6], ""], [368, "2017-06-29T17:35:57Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-06-29T17:11:39Z", [0.01], ""], [1034, "2017-06-29T06:47:28Z", [0.0], ""], [14253, "2017-06-29T05:38:15Z", [0.0], ""], [21046, "2017-06-29T03:15:34Z", [0.0], ""], [36217, "2017-06-29T02:49:22Z", [0.3], ""], [368, "2017-06-29T00:00:23Z", [0.0], ""], [36212, "2017-06-28T19:34:24Z", [0.03], ""], [36211, "2017-06-28T18:41:05Z", [0.01], ""], [36138, "2017-06-28T15:04:11Z", [0.0], ""], [35618, "2017-06-28T06:22:00Z", [0.0], "too much to do with too little time"], [1034, "2017-06-28T05:25:19Z", [0.0], ""], [61, "2017-06-28T04:25:36Z", [0.0], ""], [30364, "2017-06-28T02:11:49Z", [0.0], ""], [25695, "2017-06-27T20:35:12Z", [0.01], ""], [25656, "2017-06-27T19:47:39Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2017-06-27T19:30:04Z", [0.0], ""], [13377, "2017-06-27T18:30:28Z", [0.0], ""], [529, "2017-06-27T15:44:23Z", [0.05], "As noted, with summer legislative recess plus other factors, remaining time appears inadequate for bill passage by 10/1/17. http://host.madison.com/business/investment/markets-and-stocks/uh-oh-canada-s-recreational-marijuana-bill-could-be-in/article_4fab242e-0f09-59b2-b8d6-53e37254202c.html"], [34879, "2017-06-27T10:53:14Z", [0.05], ""], [1034, "2017-06-27T06:00:20Z", [0.0], ""], [36149, "2017-06-26T23:38:53Z", [0.05], ""], [36149, "2017-06-26T23:38:21Z", [0.25], ""], [3363, "2017-06-26T18:24:01Z", [0.15], ""], [368, "2017-06-26T17:53:55Z", [0.0], ""], [23879, "2017-06-26T17:20:30Z", [0.0], "The Standing Committee on Health, where bill C-45 currently sits, has called for public input on it, with deadline 18 August 2017 [1].

Additionally, one should consider the following:\n* Usually laws that implement a huge policy shift take longer time - for a variety of reasons: being careful with them, doing research, consulting experts. My feeling is that the Trudeau administrations is trying to handle the topic with care (they had the Task Force discussing it carefully), trying to built as much consent among citizens as possible and trying to avoid technical failures. There is no need to rush since they are in time... They surely do not want to have the implementation of the law too close to the next parliamentary elections in October 2019. But there is still plenty of time.\n* The law will soon reach the Committee stage of legislative process. There, the legislators could have hearings of experts in order to underline their opinion and in order to have some favourable media coverage. That usually takes time. And there is the Summer break... (It could be that scheduling hearings is an oppositions right - I am not sure about it; if so, it is likely that opposition will use hearings to increase their media coverage.)\n* The law, once it will have had its third reading, will go to the Senate. It seems not unlikely that Senate will have amendments... If so, it will be send back to the House of Commons.\n* Important for any 'outside view': As far as I can see, it has not been discussed in the forecaster community, so far, that the law has to be signed by the Head of State, Governor General (on behalf of the Queen) to get enacted. How long does this usually take after the bill passed parliament? However, it could be a good approach to mail someone who is familiar with parliamentary politics in Canada... will think about it! What I find a bit strange is that it is very hard to find good news articles on the whole legislative process of the marijuana legislation and that there is hardly any information about the time horizon the Government has in mind.

With just 3 weeks to go, it seems all but impossible for C-45 to reach the Senate before HoC recess starts. Reading the debates [3,4], there are at least 4 major points of contention around the bill, namely (i) the minimum legal age; (ii) whether to let people grow it at home; (iii) how to determine and punish DUIs (this is C-46); and (iv) how to fund enforcement of the new law. On the basis of this, I cannot imagine the health committee, which meets just twice a week, can report back in less than 2 weeks.

Decades ago, Canada signed three international treaties, still in force,  in which we agreed to ban marijuana. . . . \nTo do things by the book, Canadian diplomats have to tell the United Nations that we\u2019re withdrawing from the treaties, and for pot to be legal on July 1 of next year, that has to happen by July 1 of this year. If we miss the deadline, Canada can\u2019t legalize marijuana before January of 2019 at the earliest. But with 51 days to go before the deadline, it\u2019s still not clear what the Liberals\u2019 plans are. That became clear in the House of Commons on Wednesday [May 10th], when federal NDP justice critic Alistair MacGregor asked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau what the government was going to do about the looming deadline. Trudeau avoided answering, responding with some generic comments about legalization. \u201cWe do have until July 1, but I think that if the government is serious about moving ahead with legalization, withdrawing from these treaties would certainly give everyone some peace of mind that they\u2019re serious about it,\u201d MacGregor said on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s either that, or we\u2019re going to be in violation of them. I\u2019m not sure which way the government wants to go, and I would just like to have a firm answer as to what their plan is.\u201d\nMacGregor repeated his question in the Commons on Thursday afternoon; Liberal MP Matt DeCourcey would say only that the government was \u201cexamining our options.\u201d \"The federal government has no good alternative to withdrawing from (or \u2018denouncing\u2019) the three treaties. Here are the other possible strategies: 1) Ignoring the issue and legalizing pot anyway puts Canada, historically a strong supporter of the UN and other international organizations, in the position of violating international law. 2) Asking for an exception for marijuana specifically, but not the other drugs mentioned in the treaties would seem to make the most sense, but dozens of other countries, each with their own issues, would have to agree to let Canada do this. 3)  Amending the Constitution. A loophole in the treaties says that a country\u2019s constitution takes precedence. So if we were willing to enshrine a right to recreational pot in the Constitution, right up there with freedom of speech, we could move past the treaty issue. As appealing as this might sound in some circles, it would unleash dozens of other issues, each with its own constituency. (Although, in fairness, we should add that Bolivia put a right to chew coca leaves in its constitution to use this loophole.)\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  The bill (C-45) has been introduced and had a first reading in the House, but that is the easiest & quickest of about 7 steps it must go through.

A new bill is first proposed in the House of Commons;  a \u2018First Reading\u2019 is almost always without debate. The Second Reading  includes a review of the philosophy behind the bill and an overall review of the actual wording used in the bill to express that philosophy. There is public debate at this stage among the members of the House. After edits, the bill is sent to a Committee of the House for a much more granular examination of the bill, its intents, the precise wording, and the impact it may have on other existing statutes. The Committee can seek the advice of the public and of outside experts, and can make proposed amendments to the bill. This can be a lengthy process.\n\nThen the bill goes back to the House for Third Reading, debate and amendments before a final vote is called on the final wording. That\u2019s halfway through the process. The bill then has to follow the same process in the Senate. The Senate as a house of sober second thought is supposed to look at the proposed legislation from a less partisan viewpoint. Assuming the bill makes it all the way through that, it is then submitted to the Governor-General for royal assent and to convert that bill into a law.\n\nIt is a lengthy process, and will be especially complicated for as sensitive an issue as marijuana. This timeline has an additional complication, which is the the thorny issue of the Single Convention, a treaty signed by Canada and 180-some other countries governing international marijuana laws. The government has not given any indication how it intends to escape that treaty. . . . expect a multi-year experience as the bill winds its way through readings, committees, and the Senate\n "], [368, "2017-04-20T21:49:52Z", [0.0], ""], [31756, "2017-04-20T20:44:31Z", [0.44], ""], [32122, "2017-04-20T19:26:13Z", [1.0], ""], [691, "2017-04-20T17:05:53Z", [0.64], ""], [4634, "2017-04-20T05:20:16Z", [0.35], ""], [368, "2017-04-19T19:06:00Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-04-19T17:58:37Z", [0.64], ""], [22833, "2017-04-18T20:41:22Z", [0.9], ""], [12268, "2017-04-18T20:20:11Z", [0.25], "Moving forecast up because the interpretation seems to be: will this legislation get royal assent by Oct 10, 2017.

However, it seems more that they will take the time up front with the provinces in the course of debating the bill as opposed to passing something first and then leaving regulation to the provinces to work it out after passage which will take time. If this bill were an urgent priority, it could pass in the very short time that it would take given Parliament's long summer recess. But I don't think it is.

One constraint is that Canada is a signatory to the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs.  This more-or-less forbids cannabis legalization, although work-arounds might include legalism, creative reinterpretation, or even casual noncompliance. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Convention_on_Narcotic_Drugs\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20071107151130/http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaty_adherence.html In addition to the famous experiments in The Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, and four-to-eight states in the US (depending on which date you begin counting from), Uruguay also legalized marijuana a couple of years ago. However, the 800-pound-gorilla in the center of the room is the US President-Elect, Donald J Trump.  The United States has always been the global leader in the drug war fighting it ferociously inside and outside its borders.  In the past, it has not hesitated, for example, to poison crops outside its national boundaries, e.g., in Columbia and Bolivia. Donald Trump is, famously, completely abstemious (a teetotaler) from all substances in his personal life.  He is also amazingly violent against all countries that are not Russia.  He has reportedly exchanged friendly words with The Philippines' President Duterte, who has instituted extrajudicial killing of drug users while admitting to personally murdering drug users.  http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/03/world/asia/philippines-rodrigo-duterte-donald-trump.html\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2016/12/03/politics/trump-duterte-phone-call/index.html President-Elect Trump is also a longstanding TRADE PROTECTIONIST, arguably his most consistent policy position. The United States is Canada's largest trading partner by a factor of 8. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_Canada If Canada legalized marijuana, it would endanger untold billions of dollars in cross-border trade will creating a huge opportunity for illegal smuggling.  Considering Trump's comments regarding Mexico--\"they bring drugs\"--that President Trump would not hesitate to revive the Drug War seems like a safe bet (especially if he is in need of a popular issue to distract from what may be a scandal prone administration.) Finally, President Trump has proposed staffed his incoming administration with ardent drug warriors, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions (\"good people don't smoke pot\") and General Kelly.  His campaigns have relied on the financial largesse of Sheldon Adelson, one of the 10 wealthiest men in America who has single-handedly defeated marijuana propositions in the past (medical marijuana in Florida 2014) and who is married to a drug rehabilitation activist.   While Trump also has legalization friendly voices in his ear (Rep. Rohrabacher and Peter Thiel) none of them are as wealthy or powerful as Sheldon Adelson.

I put having a referendum at 90%, very likely but not a sure thing. If he has to deal with multiple unforeseen crises, he may decide not to waster effort on a promise he doesn't have to keep. Decriminalisation is also unlikely but some are arguing that this would be a sensible stepping stone to take before full legalisation. So I put that at 20%. And if it is a referendum for legalisation then I'm guessing there is a 80% chance.  Multiplying them together I get 57.6.   I should mention that this is my first forecast since reading Tetlock's book. I'm surprised at how low the number is, but the process has made me realised how many ways this could fail.

Like @JFG, I believe the outcome of this question will very much hinge on timing. Here is what we actually know: (i) Trudeau campaigned on legalization;\n(ii) on 20 Apr 2016, at a UN assembly, Canadian health minister Jane Philpott \"indicated\" that marijuana-related legislation would be introduced in Spring 2017, possibly legalization (note that if you read her actual words [3, p. 3] rather than the breathless coverage, you see that she didn't actually promise anything);\n(iii) Canadian parliament has a summer break from 24 Jun 2017 to 17 Sep 2017 [4], during which they presumably do not debate or vote on legislation;\n(iv) In fact, Canadian parliament meets for three sessions a year, \" from January to Easter, from Easter to June, and from September to December\" [5]. Hence, legislation introduced in Spring is introduced in the Easter-June session, which in 2017 will be 1 May 2017 to 23 Jun 2017 [4];\n(v) when Parliament reconvenes on 18 September 2017, they have exactly two weeks before the question's 1 Oct 2017 deadline. Canadian Parliament has a website [6] detailing various aspects of the legislative process -- bill introduction, arguments, royal assent, etc. As far as I can tell from my extensive but admittedly non-exhaustive browse of it, the only bills that make it through Parliament in less than 3 months are either budgets, or very minor / specialized issues. The vast majority of bills seem to take over 6 months to pass, and more than half seem to take over a year. Given the scope of legalizing marijuana --- from health issues to ironing out differences between provinces to international treaties on drug law --- I see little chance that such a bill would pass quickly. The popular support for legalizing marijuana is large but not overwhelming; I'd bet many senators and representatives are able to make electoral gains by opposing it. One other issue is whether marijuana legislation would even be introduced in Spring. It is well-known that when people estimate how long complex tasks will take, they are often wrong by as much as a factor of 2. When I started thinking about this question, and before finding out about the three sessions of Parliament, I thought it very likely that introduction would be delayed. However the government commissioned a task force to study public health impact of marijuana, and they seem to have completed their work on time [7], suggesting government does have a solid plan to introduce a bill in Spring. Finally, if I try to imagine a way for a marijuana bill to pass freakishly quickly, I come up with a scenario where Trudeau's party has a substantial majority in both Houses, eliminating the need for lengthy negotiations and amendments. (Even so, would it not look bad to the public if such an impactful law were rushed?) But while Trudeau does have a comfortable majority in the Commons, he doesn't control the Senate [8,9]. In summary, I expect a marijuana bill to be introduced in the Commons, but I don't expect it to move to the Senate before the summer break. And I certainly don't expect it to clear the Senate in two weeks. To get a probability, I picked 12 bills at random, calculated the average and s.d. of the time it took them to pass, and plugged that into a normal distribution. Got 7.8%, let's call it 10% to account for general uncertainty since these events are fairly far in the future.

Bill is printed. Second Reading:  in the same House of Parliament. Members debate and vote on the principle of the bill. The House may decide to refer the bill to a legislative, standing or a special committee, or to Committee of the Whole. Consideration in Committee: Consideration by the appropriate parliamentary committee (clause-by-clause study of the bill). Committee can summon witnesses and experts to provide it with information and help in improving the bill. Report Stage: Committee reports the bill to the House clearly indicating any amendments proposed. House considers amendments and votes for or against them. Third Reading: Debate and vote on bill as amended. Once bill has been read 3 times in the House, it is sent to the Senate for its consideration. Royal Assent\nBill is presented to the Governor General for assent.\nThe Governor General may assent to Bill in the Queen's name, withhold assent or reserve assent.\nWhen Bill is given Royal Assent it becomes law.

It was introduced on Feb 1, 2005, passed by the house of commons on June 28, then by the senate on July 19 receiving royal assent the next day. So a total of 4 and a half months. Where the comparison is  \"inaccurate\" is that in 2005 the liberals had a minority government, which could have slowed the process down, and in 2015 the senate composition is a little murky.  So a quick look at the current senate composition reveals more conservatives than liberals (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_current_Senators_of_Canada#Standings). On the other hand, if look closely we see a bunch of \"unaffiliated\" senators. Looking at who appointed the senators as a proxy for affiliation, we see that 49 of 99 current senators were appointed by liberal prime ministers (P.E. Trudeau, Chretien, Martin, J. Trudeau) and the rest appointed by harper. There are 6 other pending appointments by JT that would tip the balance (provided the senators vote as expected.) On the whole the question relies on the following factors: 1) The government proposes the bill as promised (85%). \n2) It survives the house of commons readings (99%, Liberal majority)\n3) It survives the senate (?? - 70% -- I assume they wouldn't present the bill if its' gonna get defeated, also see the count above)\n4) It gets royal assent (99% though I haven't read up on the GG's feelings on this, or precedent for saying no)\n5) This all happens in time (conditioning on all the above things, with a 4.5 month timeline, the thing would have to proposed by mid may, but a shorter timeline is likely possible --80%) Putting all the numerology together, it's remarkably close to 50/50, though there is so much uncertainty here that I could easily be happy with 70/30 in either direction.
