The tax law has morphed into a tax loophole used by many wealthy investors.  President Trump spoke often about closing tax loopholes during his campaign.  Congress never ran for president and its members like having wealthy donors.  Rocking the boat of the wealthy to help President Trump would be a poor decision by Congress.  In my opinion, this tax loophole will stay open for a long time.    https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/basics/investment-products/municipal-bonds\n http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-municipal-bonds-20161118-story.html\nhttp://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/nn/articles/Municipal-Bonds-When-Tax-Free-Isn-t-So-Free\n "], [34589, "2017-06-11T21:56:01Z", [0.0], ""], [34353, "2017-06-11T21:16:42Z", [0.0], ""], [2965, "2017-06-11T15:18:21Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-06-11T03:53:48Z", [0.0], ""], [34353, "2017-06-10T16:54:19Z", [0.0], ""], [35987, "2017-06-10T13:19:28Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-06-10T12:51:48Z", [0.0], ""], [30364, "2017-06-10T12:41:16Z", [0.01], ""], [691, "2017-06-09T20:31:55Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-06-09T19:54:56Z", [0.0], ""], [34353, "2017-06-09T18:47:12Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-06-08T18:44:24Z", [0.0], ""], [34353, "2017-06-08T11:53:54Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-06-08T11:29:59Z", [0.0], ""], [35962, "2017-06-08T09:58:36Z", [0.0], "First, the time to 8/1/17 is much too compressed for so difficult a policy initiative; Second, the vested interest in muni bond interest exemption is comprehensive, entrenched, and easily converted to political activism - the difficulty of actually achieving this policy increases significantly with the prospect that it will seriously be attempted."], [368, "2017-06-07T19:25:56Z", [0.0], ""], [2965, "2017-06-07T16:27:23Z", [0.0], ""], [34353, "2017-06-07T11:57:49Z", [0.0], ""], [20053, "2017-06-06T18:56:25Z", [0.0], ""], [31238, "2017-06-06T18:53:36Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-06-06T18:19:35Z", [0.0], ""], [2965, "2017-06-06T14:26:32Z", [0.01], ""], [691, "2017-06-06T12:23:03Z", [0.0], ""], [34353, "2017-06-06T11:54:57Z", [0.0], ""], [32723, "2017-06-06T10:24:14Z", [0.78], "Sofern sich keiner quer stellt wird es wohl durchgeboxt "], [26356, "2017-06-06T09:31:58Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-06-05T17:24:28Z", [0.0], ""], [2965, "2017-06-05T15:44:39Z", [0.0], ""], [34353, "2017-06-05T12:25:34Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-06-04T20:05:43Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-06-04T18:02:28Z", [0.0], ""], [35879, "2017-06-04T16:16:57Z", [0.0], ""], [34353, "2017-06-04T15:55:19Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-06-03T18:10:25Z", [0.0], ""], [34353, "2017-06-03T16:22:08Z", [0.0], ""], [2965, "2017-06-03T14:42:14Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-06-02T19:42:39Z", [0.0], ""], [35901, "2017-06-02T18:36:18Z", [0.15], ""], [30364, "2017-06-02T12:15:46Z", [0.02], ""], [34353, "2017-06-02T11:05:12Z", [0.0], ""], [2965, "2017-06-01T22:27:24Z", [0.0], "gridlock"], [35879, "2017-06-01T17:47:56Z", [0.0], "This exemption is incredibly popular with the elite, and is what makes fixed income in a taxable account feasible.
