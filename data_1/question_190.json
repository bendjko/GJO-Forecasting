Looking at part of the EWP definitions, I\u2019d like to offer an opinion about two points related to this phrase: \u201ctargeted as part of a specific group, over a period of one year or less\u201d 1. I now believe (but wouldn\u2019t be surprised if EWP made a clarification that contradicted this) that the period related to any specific question starts when the question is introduced and runs through the end of CY 2016. (I believe the other ideas that it either looks back in a running period of a year or is the whole calendar year are wrong.) 2. There are at least two interpretations of which group(s) are targeted. A narrow interpretation is that whatever government (\u201cin\u201d tribe) forces there are target only a specific subset of the population. Then there is a broader interpretation that any significant deaths that are not combat related or otherwise proscribed would count (in the sense that those targeted are \u201coutsiders\u201d in some sense).
