And now the hemorrhaging is threatening the nation\u2019s chances of overcoming its long economic collapse. Desperate oil workers and criminals are also stripping the oil company of vital equipment, vehicles, pumps and copper wiring, carrying off whatever they can to make money. The double drain \u2014 of people and hardware \u2014 is further crippling a company that has been teetering for years yet remains the country\u2019s most important source of income.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  Maduro has survived with the support of cronies and the military, but to me, that workers are beginning to dismantle PDVSA facilities says that it has  become apparent to everyone that the country is in a death spiral.  Who has the most to lose by this?  Maduro's inner circle and the military.  So, I expect there to be an inside coup soon--before PDVSA and the country is beyond salvaging.

Venezuela\u2019s far-left president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, on Sunday won re-election to a six-year term in a race that was called illegitimate by the opposition and foreign governments. Mr. Maduro\u2019s win paves the way for the imposition of stricter international sanctions, including potential new U.S. measures targeting the country\u2019s already-hindered oil industry. \u201cThe specter of U.S. oil sanctions on the embattled Latin American producer now looms large as Washington strives to tighten the financial noose,\u201d according to Stephen Brennock, analyst at brokerage PVM Oil Associates Ltd (Para. 1-4).

The leaders who sided with her in that challenging endeavor today are either imprisoned or have gone into exile, while she has been officially prohibited from leaving the country and banned from political participation for a year, not to mention being the frequent target of ridicule by the government.\n. . . \nSo, with four men deciding to register to face off against Maduro at the polls in an electoral process considered to be fraudulent by the vast majority of the opposition and a good portion of the international community, Machado stepped up her national tour because, she said, \u201cthe day of the definitive breakdown of the dictatorship is close.\u201d She said she has rushed to visit 14 of Venezuela\u2019s 23 federal states over the past three months and she has participated in about 100 activities so far this year to reiterate that the \u201conly option\u201d is to \u201ckick out\u201d the Bolivarian Revolution \u2013 which seized power in 1999 \u2013 \u201cby force.\u201d Machado hastens to note, however, that she is not talking about any kind of armed struggle but rather the joining of \u201ccitizen forces against the regime\u201d that will unite with the \u201cinstitutional strength\u201d of the opposition-controlled Parliament, which supports putting Maduro on trial for corruption. In addition, she notes that the call for Maduro\u2019s resignation is backed by dozens of governments around the world who reject the May 20 vote, but there is one other group that the movement needs to bring on board: the Venezuelan armed forces. \u201cWe\u2019re already in anarchy,\u201d she said. In Monagas this past week, the Vente Venezuela leader managed to bring her message to hundreds of people, urging them to abstain from casting ballots in the upcoming election, saying that the way to get out of the current crisis is via the ballot box but Maduro must be removed from the presidency.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  Perhaps naively, I didn't think that there was anyone in Venezuela who was daring to speak out against Maduro.

The opposition, however, has been very disorganized due to ideological and political differences and have failed to create a united front against Maduro.

Maduro enjoys a high level of control over the government and a growing interdependence with the military.

The elections were previously going to be held in Dec 2018 so that suggests an inauguration no earlier than Jan 2019. But now that the election date has been changed twice --- to Apr 2018, then May 2018 --- I can't find a clear statement anywhere on whether the inauguration date changes. Still, since it is Maduro himself who is changing the election dates, it seems unlikely he'd change the inauguration date to SOONER. If he wins it makes no difference, and if he loses he's worse off. Browsing the news, it seems Maduro is very secure in his current post. The only challenges seem to be from other candidates in the upcoming election. Plus the price of oil has risen dramatically in the last year. So I can't see him being forced out of office in the next 2.5 months.

This move shuts out the opposition and adds fuel to the fire of protestors against Maduro. Venezuela's neighbors are adding to the tension.

Maduro's departure may also come from a move by his own party to show Chavistas some response/ change giving the continually deteriorating economic and social conditions.  https://www.economist.com/news/americas/21736192-asian-giant-taking-advantage-other-powers-lack-interest-region-china-moves https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-01-30/venezuelan-pirates-rule-the-most-lawless-market-on-earth https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/How-Far-Can-Venezuelas-Oil-Production-Fall.html\n"], [51207, "2018-02-05T13:43:04Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [46132, "2018-02-05T05:55:00Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [50056, "2018-02-05T04:07:29Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.9], "While coup attempts overall have significantly decreased worldwide since the end of the Cold War, there is some research that suggests that attempts have been more successful overall when they do happen. In Venezuela, the last successful coup attempt was in 1954. There were two unsuccessful attempts by Chavez, and another unsuccessful coup against Chavez. The decreased frequency of coup attempts overall, even coupled with the more successful rate of coups, provide a base rate by which we can judge the likelihood of a coup happening. In the case of Venezuela, there is a combination of economic instability, food insecurity, political chaos, and breakdown of the rule of law. There is also total lack of faith in the democratic process and active suppression of opposition by the government. While the situation is growing desperate in Venezuela, no coup attempt will be successful in removing Maduro from power unless the military can be recruited, and so far I don't see any evidence that this has happened. Things can change quickly, and Maduro appears to be badly mishandling the crisis. I believe Maduro will be overthrown, but without clear evidence that the military is supporting overthrow, and without a powerful outside actor such as the US taking an interest in the proceedings, I do not think the overthrow will happen in the next several months and it could take years."], [23006, "2018-02-05T02:17:14Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.65], ""], [368, "2018-02-04T23:56:58Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [1034, "2018-02-04T21:45:41Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [51109, "2018-02-04T20:42:34Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.1, 0.89], ""], [51067, "2018-02-04T16:44:21Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [50559, "2018-02-04T16:21:16Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.8], "Coming to this question late in the process limits my choices, I suppose, but it doesn't change them.

Crude production fell 11% in December from the month before, according to government figures released Thursday. Over all of 2017, output was down 29%, among the steepest national declines in recent history, driven by mismanagement and under investment at the state oil company, say industry observers and oilmen. The drop is deeper than that experienced by Iraq after the 2003 war there\u2014when the amount of crude pumped fell 23%\u2014or by Russia during the collapse of the Soviet Union, according to data from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (para. 1-3). Venezuela\u2019s large output drop means the country has been the only major oil producer to not benefit from rising crude prices. The value of the Venezuelan oil export basket rose 25% last year on the back of stronger global demand and shrinking inventories (para.17). But this windfall was wiped out by lower output and the rising cost of oil products imported by PdVSA to aid its operations (para. 17-18). Venezuela\u2019s decline is already benefiting its OPEC peers who have been able to raise their own output without breaking the cartel\u2019s production cut agreement. OPEC\u2019s overall production edged higher by 42,000 barrels a day in December from the previous month (para. 23).

I found this article relevant: http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-41094889. How is it working with Parliament?  Against, it seems.  The assembly has now been granted more power than parliament.  The assembly was not voted into being by the people, but the parliament membership is due to voters.  Anti-Maduro people are being dragged into the net of \"treason\", as opposed to one labelled \"trustworthy reason\". Maduro is being described as a dictator-in-the-making.  Often, it takes a coup to overthrow a dictator.  Coups are normally planned in secret.  Therefore, scouring international reporting resources is less likely to produce evidence of timing or method. While Maduro's corruptions are to blame for many problems, such as shortages of vital medicines, petrol, and food. it takes either money and secrecy or extreme emotion to overthrow a leader.  The Venezuelan government has just about made it impossible to peaceful removal of Maduro, basically leaving only nasty upheaval as a means. Desperate people can flash into a conflagration of hatred, violence, and more, in an instant.  Without sources in the poorest parts of the country, I can't predict a timing of a coup.  By \"poorest\", I mean the sectors of society lacking critical infrastructure: patients without medical care, regardless of income; citizens without tools for sanitation such as toilet paper; people living in state housing which is not being maintained; let alone a lack of income. Unemployed people have time on their hands.  The population has a plethora of this resource.  The unemployed can foment hate, they can organize riots, revolutions, and coups.  They just can't fund the latter. Functionally, for a coup to succeed, there are two major phases:\n1. Planning and execution\n2. Funding the new order.  In a cash-strapped economy, the funding often comes from outsiders, or rich insiders.  https://nypost.com/2017/01/10/how-venezuelas-corrupt-socialists-are-looting-the-country-to-death: the funds which quietly were syphoned out of the country may return in 2018.  Does anyone have additional insight into sources of funding which could be used for a revolution or coup?  Political analysts are looking for supporters of the Venezulan Fifth Column.  I found several minor mentions of this, but no major analysis.  Here is a longer article: http://www.wsbtv.com/news/the-latest-venezuela-rejects-trump-talk-of-military-option/589544836. Maduro's term ends on 2019.  Venezuela's citizenry might chose to wait for elections.  On the other hand, with the Constituent Assembly's strength growing like a cancer, the citizens might believe that their choices would not be honored.  I do predict major unrest as the end of Maduro's term approaches."], [45594, "2018-01-06T08:49:32Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.8], ""], [1034, "2018-01-06T06:09:17Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [45153, "2018-01-06T02:07:08Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [15529, "2018-01-06T00:14:22Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.15, 0.85], ""], [46797, "2018-01-06T00:04:02Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.05, 0.9], ""], [46565, "2018-01-05T23:48:03Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.2, 0.6], ""], [46766, "2018-01-05T23:36:53Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.15, 0.8], ""], [368, "2018-01-05T22:37:40Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [368, "2018-01-05T22:24:03Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [368, "2018-01-05T22:06:09Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [46171, "2018-01-05T18:29:33Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [41379, "2018-01-05T17:41:29Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.15, 0.25, 0.6], "As long as the US is embroiled in all things Trump Maduro will not face as much pressure to step down as he might."], [46388, "2018-01-05T17:37:43Z", [0.1, 0.15, 0.15, 0.0, 0.6], ""], [46471, "2018-01-05T16:56:43Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.1, 0.8], ""], [46356, "2018-01-05T16:49:58Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.15, 0.8], ""], [691, "2018-01-05T16:24:13Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [46592, "2018-01-05T12:53:37Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [1034, "2018-01-05T11:47:50Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [46557, "2018-01-05T09:30:59Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.94], ""], [46116, "2018-01-05T03:57:15Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.04, 0.07, 0.89], ""], [46416, "2018-01-05T03:45:41Z", [0.3, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.1], ""], [46467, "2018-01-05T01:10:18Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.3, 0.3, 0.4], ""], [368, "2018-01-05T00:03:34Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [23006, "2018-01-04T23:33:25Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.25, 0.55], ""], [23006, "2018-01-04T23:32:56Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.4, 0.55], ""], [23006, "2018-01-04T23:32:29Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.2, 0.75], ""], [46025, "2018-01-04T21:51:56Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.6, 0.4], "The Venezuelan Economy is collapsing, which will play into the hands of his fall.

Based on these base rates I have proceeded to calculate the probability of Maduro ceasing to be president two distinct futures.

Less likely to initiate country-wide protests to depose Maduro before the polls - +2% to post-1July bracket.\n2.\tChavismo \u2013 Maduro\u2019s populist movement \u2013 still holds sway and popularity amongst the poorer classes of Venezuelans and has the backing of security organizations - +3% to post-1July bracket.\n3.\tI assume if there were a PDSVA bond default from the ripple effects it would take time for pressure to build on Maduro\u2019s government that would force him to step down from presidency.

The woes of the group, whose full name is Petroleos de Venezuela S.A., look set to worsen because of US sanctions imposed last month restricting its access to credit. Oil production keeps declining and much of what is exported goes to repay billions of dollars in loans. That puts the government of President Nicolas Maduro in a very tight spot. It relies on PDVSA's export income for 96 percent of foreign earnings, and to pay for many social programs. Reduced oil revenues means\u2019 \"there is a real chance of default,\" said Tamas Varga, an analyst at London-based PVM Oil Associates (para 1-6). The break-even market price for Venezuelan oil \"is well over $125 per barrel,\" Williams said (para 23). That poses a challenge, given global oil prices slumped dramatically three years ago and never recovered. They are now half of what they were in mid-2014. According to PDVSA's latest annual report, the average 2016 price of a barrel of Venezuelan crude was $35.15. The oil company earned $48 billion last year from 2.27 million barrels a day (mbpd) produced -- sharply down from $72 billion in 2015, when it pumped 2.65 mbpd (para. 23-26). Agence France Presse.

For now, the country will shrug off the setbacks, but in the longer run they augur potentially the messiest debt restructuring in history. The Trump administration last week prohibited US institutions from involvement in any new debt or shares issued by the Venezuelan government or its state-controlled oil company, PDVSA. Dividend payments by PDVSA\u2019s US oil refinery arm Citgo were also blocked. The broad aim is a financial embargo of the Latin American country to prevent it from raising more money in the US. \u201cThe message is that the US doesn\u2019t want its financial system enabling the Venezuelan government in any way,\u201d says Charles Blitzer, of Blitzer Consulting, who is a former International Monetary Fund official. Meanwhile, Venezuela suffered a loss in the US courts, where a judge said Canadian miner Crystallex could seize Venezuelan money held in an account at Bank of New York Mellon to cover a $1.4bn judgment awarded by a World Bank tribunal. Adding to the headwinds, a big US clearing house said this week it would stop settling some Venezuelan bonds, and Cantor Fitzgerald has stopped trading them altogether, according to investors.

Maduro launched the warning in a speech to his top military leadership, including General Vladimir Padrino, his defense minister, and General Remigio Ceballos, commander of operational strategy, two days before the drills begin Saturday. \"We must be clear, especially for the youth in the military, that we must close ranks within the homeland -- that this is no time for any fissures and that those with doubts should leave the armed forces immediately,\" Maduro said (para. 1-3). Maduro urged the military to \"be prepared to fight fiercely... in the face of an eventual\" US invasion (para 8). Maduro told the military leaders that in the face of possible future added US sanctions on Venezuela, \"I decided to do some re-casting... we have to prepare ourselves\" (para 13). He pointed out that Del Pino, who has been at the helm of PDVSA since 2014, was the architect of agreements between OPEC and non-OPEC countries to boost flagging crude prices. As for Martinez, who took over the oil ministry in January, Maduro said he would work to increase Chinese, Russian, Indian and Malaysian investments in PDVSA's various projects. \"We are in a moment of flexibility to face the economic war,\" said Maduro (para 13-16).

After years of mismanagement, the country appears closer and closer to running out of money. Adding to investors\u2019 concern is the increasingly anti-democratic turn of President Nicolas Maduro, whose move to rewrite the constitution and strip power from congress has been met with U.S. sanctions. Still, for all the turmoil, Venezuela has a track record of paying its debts, and investors who\u2019ve held on through the worst of times have been rewarded with some of the world\u2019s best bond returns. 1. What are investors\u2019 main concerns? First, the economics look bad. Foreign reserves have dwindled to a 15-year low of about $10 billion, a grim figure considering Venezuela and the state oil company known as PDVSA are due to pay about $13 billion in debt before the end of 2018. Combine that with oil prices at half of what they were just three years ago, slumping crude output in a country that gets 95 percent of its export revenue from that one resource, triple-digit inflation and a rapidly shrinking economy, and it\u2019s a tough road ahead. Second, the level of political turmoil is unprecedented, with deadly street protests against Maduro\u2019s government raging on a near daily basis, open calls for the military to stage a coup and shortages of food and medicines as the government prioritizes debt payments over imports of basic goods. 2. How creditworthy is the country? Venezuela isn\u2019t current with most of its key economic statistics, so the most basic data an investor would use to gauge the country\u2019s creditworthiness aren\u2019t available. One key number is the current account balance, a broad measure of trade that looks at money moving in and out of the country, including bond interest payments. Normally, a government would borrow money to plug any gap, but steep borrowing costs preclude such a tactic for Venezuela. Estimates of the size of the country\u2019s current account deficit vary depending on which economist you ask and assumptions about how much the country has slashed imports to keep paying its debts. Still, we can be pretty sure that the situation is unsustainable. 3. When will the money run out? To make ends meet, the government is blowing through central bank reserves. That hoard now consists of just $1 billion in cash, with much of the balance made up of gold bars, according to investment bank Torino Capital. Venezuela can buy itself some time by continuing to take advance payments for its oil from China and Russia -- as long as they\u2019re willing to pay them. And it can keep reducing imports. However, the economy depends on foreign manufacturers for everything from antibiotics to baby formula, and shortages have already become severe, so the humanitarian costs are significant (para. 1-4).

The new \u201cconstituent assembly,\u201d put together to rewrite the constitution, is seen by most as an attempt to erode the nation\u2019s democracy and consolidate power in the hands of the president (para. 1-2) \nBut even if Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro manages to maintain power and push through a new constitution that defangs any restraints on his grip, he won\u2019t be able to outrun the spiraling economic crisis. Perhaps the most visible economic issue is the debt payments that fall due this year. Venezuela has $5 billion in debt maturing before the year is out \u2013 both in sovereign bonds and in debt payments by state-owned oil company PDVSA (para. 4). \nThat is an alarming figure given that the government has an estimated $3 billion in cash reserves, according to S&P Global Ratings, a paltry sum that means a default in the next few months is more likely than not. Venezuela has to pay $725 million in debt payments this month, although the problem gets really serious in October and November, when a combined $3.6 billion in debt must be paid to bondholders. The value of PDVSA\u2019s bonds has plunged in recent weeks (para. 4-6). The probability of default within 12 months, based on the value of credit-default swaps on Venezuelan debt, has an implied rate of 70 percent, according to the WSJ (para. 9). Cunningham, N. (2017).

This suggests that the senior officers and officials are starting to plan for taking their money and running, because they do not expect the regime to last much longer. \nThe most likely scenarios are either officers just loose control of the troops or that junior officers launch a coup.

Former Foreign Minister Delcy Rodriguez's nomination as leader was unanimously approved by the assembly's 545 delegates in Friday's session, which was held despite strong criticism from Washington and Venezuela's opposition, which fear the body will be a tool for imposing dictatorship. Supporters say it will pacify a country rocked by violent protests. The assembly was scheduled to meet again Saturday, and Rodriguez said it would be taking action against the socialist government's opponents. \"Don't think we're going to wait weeks, months or years,\" she said on Friday. \"Tomorrow we start to act. The violent fascists, those who wage economic war on the people, those who wage psychological war, justice is coming for you.\" The installation of the constitutional assembly is virtually certain to intensify a political crisis that has brought four months of protests that left at least 120 people dead and hundreds jailed. Maduro vows the assembly will strip opposition lawmakers of their constitutional immunity from prosecution, while members of congress say they will only be removed by force. But the opposition is struggling to regain its footing in the face of the government's strong-armed tactics and the re-emergence of old, internal divisions. Several opposition activists have been jailed in recent days, others are rumored to be seeking exile and one leader has broken ranks from the opposition alliance to say his party will field candidates in regional elections despite widespread mistrust in Venezuela's electoral system (para. 1-6).

The brimming oil inventories that have pressured prices for three years had started to decline in recent weeks as U.S. demand rose and OPEC production was reduced. But some analysts say this decline in stockpiles could reverse later in the year as U.S. crude production continues to grow. A poll of 15 investment banks, surveyed by The Wall Street Journal at the end of July, predicted that Brent crude, the international benchmark, will average $53 a barrel this year, down $2 from the June survey. The banks expect West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. oil gauge, to average $51 a barrel this year, down a dollar from the previous survey. Banks in the survey have also downgraded their expectations for next year, predicting Brent crude will average $55 a barrel, down $2 from the June poll. The banks expect WTI to average $53 a barrel in 2018, also down $2 (para 1-4). However, stock levels around the world continue to be above historical averages, as the world struggles to drain the crude glut that has pressured prices since 2014. That\u2019s in part due to the increasing flow of oil from U.S. fields (para 11). U.S. oil production last week rose by 20,000 barrels a day, the EIA data showed. Meanwhile, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which last year clinched a deal to limit its output, has seen some of its members produce above the agreed-upon levels as they make up for budget shortfalls (para. 11-12).

Both had already been under house arrest when the officers dragged them away, reportedly to the Ramo Verdea military prison. During their house arrest, they\u2019d been broadcasting messages using Periscope, a live-streaming service that has become extraordinarily popular in Venezuela, encouraging their supporters to oppose President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. \nPerhaps ironically, hours before his arrest Ledezma had lambasted the opposition coalition, MUD, for its many failures in the lead-up to Sunday\u2019s vote. But he also said that MUD had to execute on promises it had made during a symbolic protest election held two weeks ago to create a separate government and boycott regular elections (para. 1-5).

It had taken control of the National Assembly after years of having been outflanked by Venezuela\u2019s left. It was planning new laws, the release of its political prisoners and overhauls intended to pull Venezuela out of a deep economic crisis. Its eye was on the presidency in 2018. But with one contentious vote on Sunday, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro effectively liquidated any political challenge that the opposition might present for him for years to come. Around midnight, officials certified the creation of a new political body, known as the constituent assembly, with the power to rewrite the Constitution to favor Mr. Maduro and empowered in the meantime to dismiss any branch of government viewed as disloyal. It was a dramatic crash for the country\u2019s opposition in its long quest to regain control of Venezuela after a tide of popular discontent brought Hugo Ch\u00e1vez to the presidency in 1999. Not since the politicians joined the military to back a failed coup in 2002 \u2014 which spurred Mr. Ch\u00e1vez to purge his opponents \u2014 have members of Venezuela\u2019s opposition been laid so low. \u201cThey played all their cards, and they played them effectively,\u201d said Christopher Sabatini, a foreign policy expert at the Columbia University School of International and Public Affairs, citing the opposition\u2019s attempts to parry Mr. Maduro this year. \u201cBut now all of their channels for representation and means for mediation have essentially evaporated.\u201d Mr. Maduro\u2019s decision to sweep aside his rivals leaves them at a difficult crossroads, analysts said.

Why? Its members are addicted to oil. Eight months after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries announced a plan for its 14 members and 10 allied countries to withhold almost 2% of the world\u2019s oil every day to boost prices, seven of the 11 OPEC members that pledged to cut appear to be producing more oil than promised. Crude prices have actually fallen, by 7.6% to $52.52 a barrel, since the beginning of the year\u2014half what the cartel called a fair price just three years ago and a level that some say is here for the long term. Previously, low production costs meant OPEC members profited even when oil prices fell. These days, members have ramped up government spending to keep populations happy and cover military expenses, and don\u2019t have a cushion to let oil revenues slip. Their strained budgets can be covered only through increasingly high prices per barrel, and if prices are low they need to produce more (para 1-5). The output has stolen market share from the cartel\u2019s members and pushed prices lower. OPEC\u2019s share of the global oil market has shrunk to 40% today from 55% in the early 1970s, when its embargo on sales to the West quadrupled oil prices in six months (para 13). The dynamic working against OPEC is that, collectively, its members need the highest oil prices of any industry player\u2014more than companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp. , Royal Dutch Shell PLC and most U.S. shale producers, according to Goldman Sachs . For decades, OPEC was the low-cost producer of oil. During the boom years of 2011 through 2014, OPEC members, which largely fund national spending with oil revenue, could balance their budgets with oil prices $10 to $40 a barrel less than most oil companies needed to fund their spending and pay dividends. Today, OPEC needs $10 to $20 a barrel more than Big Oil and U.S. exploration and production outfits, the investment bank said in a report to clients (para. 13- 15).

Nearly all candidates were politicians close to Mr. Maduro, presumably assuring that the outcome would leave his leftist movement with complete control of the country once the assembly takes charge. \u201cI said rain, thunder or lightning, the 30th of July was going to come,\u201d the president said in a shaky video made from his vehicle after he cast his ballot. He remained sanguine throughout the day, saying the vote would soon bring peace to a country where more than 110 people have died in unrest during protests this year against his rule. But the powers of the new assembly members will be so vast that they could possibly remove Mr. Maduro from office, some analysts noted, ending a presidency that has been deeply unpopular, even among many leftists (para. 1-5). At least 10 people were killed in clashes between the police and protesters, the government said, including two boys, ages 13 and 17, who were shot in the western state of T\u00e1chira. A police officer was shot in front of a school in T\u00e1chira, and a 43-year-old man was killed in the central city of Barquisimeto in Lara State when a bullet pierced his head, according to the state prosecutor\u2019s office (para. 13). The focus of many voters in Caracas seemed to be on food, not politics. Venezuela remains in an economic tailspin, causing severe shortages of food and medicine (para 22) \u201cWhen the opposition got the National Assembly, they said there would be food, and now it\u2019s even worse,\u201d said Juan Carlos Hern\u00e1ndez, 43, a government employee who said he supported Mr. Maduro. \u201cThe first thing I\u2019m asking of the constitutional assembly is that they start putting out food,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause if they don\u2019t, the people are going to get angry\u201d (para. 22-24).

President Nicolas Maduro has scheduled a vote that would allow him to replace the current legislative body, the National Assembly, with an entirely new institution known as the Constituent Assembly. Maduro's opponents control the National Assembly, holding 112 of the body's 167 seats, and have been battling with him for political power since they won a majority of seats in December 2015. Before the winners of those elections took office, Maduro stacked the country's Supreme Court with loyalists to prevent his own impeachment (para 1-3). Experts say the vote's outcome will be a foregone conclusion: Maduro will be able to consolidate political power (para.5). The opposition hasn't submitted any candidates for the vote because it doesn't recognize the legitimacy of the election. Maduro foes aren't going to the polls and instead have scheduled a large protest in the capital, Caracas, for Sunday. \nUltimately, Sunday's vote and the creation of Maduro's Constituent Assembly would give the President immense political power to revise the Venezuelan Constitution. \nMaduro says the vote will help bring peace to a polarized Venezuela, with all branches of the government falling under the political movement founded by Maduro's late mentor and predecessor, Hugo Chavez. \nCritics in Venezuela and abroad argue a Maduro mandate would erode any last signs of democracy in the country (para. 5-9).

Analysts refer to a breaking point.\nIt is clear to everyone that Venezuela is in crisis, but there's no easy way out. Divisions in Venezuela run deep.\nThe opposition has been vocal since Hugo Ch\u00e1vez came to power 18 years ago, but problems have become more acute under President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, a leader who does not have the following that his predecessor did, and under whose watch the economy has been pushed to the brink (para. 1-3). Re-energizing 'Chavismo'? The government now wants to create a constituent assembly. Essentially its purpose will be to rewrite the country's constitution (para 6).\nIt is a move that the government says will enable the country to be at peace. But the opposition says it is anti-democratic and feels it is just a way for President Maduro to consolidate his power. \"A constituent assembly is something that could be positive,\" says Professor Miguel Tinker Salas of Pomona College, California.\nHe argues that if it can take steps to address violence and reform the economy that is heavily dependent on oil, something positive could come out of this. \"But in this context, I just don't see how that might happen.\"\nProfessor Julia Buxton, a Venezuela expert, says there are two ways of interpreting the government's plans: as a way to re-energise \"Chavismo\", the socialist ideology of former President Ch\u00e1vez or as a way to build parallel institutions to the ones already in place and that are controlled by the opposition (para. 6-9). Opposition disarray\nThe opposition says the country's democratic institutions are being challenged (para 12). In the past few months, it has created a strategy to try and disrupt President Maduro's leadership, to try and force the government to change. But despite general strikes, the protests and the recent unofficial referendum, which rejected the constituent assembly, the government remains in power.\nOne of the problems the opposition faces is that it is not one unified party (para. 12-15). Sanctions threat Under US President Barack Obama, targeted sanctions on individuals were introduced (para 21).\nDonald Trump's administration has said it will consider further sanctions. But anything broader than targeted sanctions would be a serious blow for the country's crisis-stricken economy. Oil revenues account for 95% of Venezuela's foreign earnings.\nVenezuela may have the largest oil reserves in the world but they are heavy crude reserves and the country needs light crude from the US to be able to process it.\n\"Close off several hundred thousand barrels of oil a day, which is what the US is buying, and you are actually hurting the Venezuelan people, you're not hurting Maduro,\" says Prof Salas.\nIt could also have other unintended consequences, says Prof Buxton (para 21-25). 'Too toxic' Despite the threats of sanctions and the warnings from international leaders, the government is confident that the vote will go ahead (para 27).\nThe opposition is doing all it can to make sure it will not.\n\"At this moment, it's really too toxic to really talk about the details of how to engineer some type of orderly transition,\" says Michael McCarthy, a research fellow for the Centre for Latin American and Latino Studies at the American University in Washington DC (para 27-29).

Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note that Venezuela, which has the largest oil reserves in the world, could become the first sovereign oil producer to \"fully fail\" as a state if President Nicolas Maduro moves forward with the vote to form a new legislative body named the National Constituent Assembly (ANC). The ANC would supersede other legislative bodies \u2014 including the opposition-led National Assembly \u2014 and would be able to rewrite the country's constitution, cementing Maduro's power.

An astonishing 93% of them say they cannot afford the food they need, and three-quarters have lost weight in the past year. The regime that caused this preventable tragedy professes great love for the poor. Yet its officials have embezzled billions, making Venezuela the most corrupt country in Latin America, as well as the most ineptly governed. It is a textbook example of why democracy matters: people with bad governments should be able to throw the bums out. That is perhaps why President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro is so eager to smother what little is left of democracy in Venezuela. On July 30th, barring a last-minute change of mind, Mr Maduro will hold a rigged election to rubber-stamp the creation of a hand-picked constituent assembly whose aim is to perpetuate his unpopular state-socialist regime (see article). It will complete the destruction of the powers of parliament, now controlled by the opposition, and wreck the integrity of a presidential election due next year, which, if it were free and fair, Mr Maduro would surely lose. Opponents say the assembly will install Cuban-style communism. At the very least, its creation will provoke more violence in a country where the streets are already choked with tear gas and littered with buckshot from police shotguns. In almost four months of protests, more than 100 people have died; hundreds more have been locked up for political reasons. All this infuriates Venezuelans. It should alarm the outside world, too. The clueless caudillo of Caracas \nBy the end of this year Venezuela\u2019s economic collapse since 2012 will be the steepest in modern Latin American history. Income per person is now back where it was in the 1950s. The main cause of this calamity is ideological. Following the lead of his late mentor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, Mr Maduro spends public money lavishly, especially on his supporters. Weak oil prices and inept management mean he cannot pay his bills. So he prints money and blames speculators for the resulting inflation, which is expected to exceed 1,000% this year. The black-market price for US dollars is now about 900 times the official rate. Price controls and the expropriation of private firms have led to shortages of food and medicine. With hospitals bare of supplies, the maternal mortality rate jumped by 66% last year. Officials flagrantly profiteer from their access to hard currency and basic goods. Venezuela has become a favored route for drug-trafficking and is awash with arms. Some left-wingers, such as Britain\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn, imagine that Venezuela\u2019s \u201cBolivarian revolution\u201d is a promising experiment in social justice.

Last year, the U.S. became the world's top net exporter of fuel, an outgrowth of booming domestic production since the shale oil revolution started in 2010. That's a fundamental shift from the traditional U.S. role in global markets as a top importer and consumer. Net exports are on track to hit another record in 2017, making foreign fuel markets increasingly important for the future growth prospects and profit margins of U.S. refiners. Shale oil producers have provided refiners with abundant and cheap domestic crude supplies, giving them the raw material they need to produce internationally competitive fuel. The nation set a record in 2016 by sending a net 2.5 million barrels per day (bpd) of petroleum products to foreign markets. That compares to net fuel imports of 2.3 million just a decade ago, according to U.S. government data (para 1-5). Latin American Buyers U.S. refined products are filling shortages in countries such as Mexico and Venezuela, where refineries have been running below capacity. U.S. exports have also made inroads into Brazil's market by undercutting the price of locally produced fuel (para. 16). In recession-scarred Venezuela, the country's largest refining complex has lowered operating rates this month to less than half of its 955,000-barrel-per-day capacity, a level that has required state-run oil company PDVSA to import more fuel to meet domestic demand (para. 19). Between them, Mexico and Venezuela have recently said they want to buy extra volumes of almost 19 million barrels in the second half of the year - mostly from the United States - an amount suggesting that U.S. exports will grow again this year over last year's record levels (para. 19-20).

But Angola and Saudi Arabia production was notably higher, as was production in Iraq and Iran. (See table for numbers.)

DeFotis (2017) June 30, states that: Venezuela is nearly broke but still has a great deal of gold, which accounts for three quarters of its foreign reserves of just more than $10 billion. A guest on Bloomberg Radio Friday morning suggested that Venezuela could be selling gold to pay for chemicals to dilute its domestic \"heavy\" oil for fuel. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs Asset Management reportedly sold Venezuela bonds with a face value of at least $300 million to a small group of hedge funds in recent days, according to an anonymous source quoted by MarketWatch, which notes that the Goldman bond purchase in May drew harsh criticism from Venezuelan opposition leaders and others who think investors should not finance the authoritarian regime of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Food and necessities have been in short supply for an extended period, and anti-government protests have left more than 50 people dead this year. In his missive today, Venezuela critic Russ Dallen, a publisher, lawyer and Venezuela bond investor through Caracas Capital, offers some background on the political stagnation under Maduro. In short, the escalating violence and civil strife in the country means an impending \"inflection point,\" Dallen says: \" ...the Maduro regime has been unable to raise significant foreign capital \u2013 aside from the loan from Rosneft (ROSN.Russia) against 49.9% of Petroleos de Venezuela's U.S. refining operation Citgo (a story which we first help break on December 21) and the \u201cmorally repugnant\u201d cash injection from Goldman Sachs last month. The Maduro regime\u2019s refusal to co-exist and/or negotiate with an Opposition-dominated legislature (a task of functioning democracies all over the world) has led Maduro to unleash his own weapon of mass destruction \u2013 the hydrogen bomb of calling a National Constituent Assembly (ANC) ... \nThe government is using this wafer-thin veneer of constitutional legality for two reasons ... One is to bring along the military rank-and-file. While the upper echelons of the military are \u201call in\u201d as they are making money with various schemes ... The second reason for the legal lipservice is an attempt to give legal surety to potential investors (namely Russia, China & others interested in investing in oil, gold and mineral mining ventures) that were put off by the lack of National Assembly approval or a legally solid workaround. ... the Supreme Court takes over the right to approve any new oil, gold or mineral investments since the National Assembly is in \u201ccontempt.\u201d But Russia and other investors felt that ground was too shaky to invest billions of dollars, hence the regime\u2019s National Constituent Assembly is designed to replace the obstinate National Assembly and pave that legal path for investment more solidly ...\" \nOne more sign that Venezuela's cash situation is in peril: In mid-June, Canadian miner Gold Reserve (GDRZF) said it received a $40 million installment from Venezuela as part of a $1 billion settlement to be paid over the next two years. The settlement resolves the Venezuelan government's expropriation of a Gold Reserve copper-and-gold project with the possibility of a new mining joint venture. In 1992, Gold Reserves acquired the Brisas gold and copper mining project in southeastern Venezuela, believed to be one of the largest undeveloped such deposits in the world. Gold Reserves invested US$300 million in Brisas through April 2008, when the Venezuelan government under then-President Hugo Chavez revoked its project authorization. The International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) awarded Gold Reserve damages and interest. Much more detail on the case is on the Gold Reserve website (para. 1-6). DeFotis, D.

Its tragic and volatile mix of a failing, oil-dependent economy, political gridlock and simmering unrest is well known at this point. \nBut things are building to a head, partly due to the relentless logic of the bond market and partly due to the more proprietary logic of U.S. foreign policy. \nVenezuelan bonds, which haven't looked rock-solid for a few years, crashed this week as embattled President Nicola Maduro renewed calls to rewrite the country's constitution, which would effectively disenfranchise the millions of Venezuelans who oppose him and entrench his regime.

Corporate hopes were raised by a deal between members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other non-OPEC producers to cut production, which lifted oil prices above $58 a barrel in January, after they had slid to as low as $27 in 2016. But Brent crude prices have since slipped back below $50 and banks have lowered price forecasts, amid surging output from the United States and other nations not bound by the global oil pact. Investors are again focusing on the ability of top oil firms such as Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Total (TOTF.PA) to live within their means and eke out profits when oil has failed to recover, as hoped, to $60. The majors, often dubbed Big Oil, have already been through tough spending cuts since a collapse in crude prices since mid-2014 from above $100. They have shed thousands of jobs, scrapped projects, sold assets and squeezed service costs (para. 1-5). Bousso, R. (2017). After false dawn, Big Oil to double down on cost cuts. Reuters.

Speaking at a briefing at the Capitol, Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., said Venezuela President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has consolidated power, corrupted the courts and removed checks on his executive authority while silencing political opposition. He has \u201ccondemned his own people to poverty, starvation and immense suffering,\u201d while amassing wealth and power, Menendez said. \u201cHis actions are straight out of the play books of Hugo Chavez, Fidel Castro and other brutal dictators,\u201d the senator said the briefing held by the Congressional Hispanic Leadership Institute, a non-partisan group with connections to the Republican-dominated Congressional Hispanic Conference. Many of the members of Congress who are focusing attention on the situation in Venezuela are of Cuban descent. Many are from Florida, where the largest Venezuelan population can be found, followed by Texas and New York. But making the comparisons can be somewhat dicey in a Congress that is split over relations with Cuba and the push to end the more than 50-year-old embargo of U.S trade with Cuba. Sen.

Avenues and thoroughfares across eastern Caracas were shut down after hastily issued calls by student groups, while a public-transportation strike kept buses from, rolling on the south side for a third day. Morning commuters walked to work in many areas, fording piles of trash and debris, or ducking under ropes and wires used to cordon off streets. The abrupt traffic paralysis came in the face of an assembly Maduro has set for July 30 that would begin reconceiving the crisis-torn nation\u2019s charter, an initiative critic say is meant to give him authoritarian power. A coalition of opposition parties have organized more than 100 days of demonstrations that have claimed scores of lives and left hundreds more injured.

His decision caused uproar. Anti-government activists, who had already been on the streets for a month protesting about the erosion of democracy and the dire state of the economy, stepped up their campaign and have been demonstrating ever since. More than 90 people have died in the violence and thousands have been injured and arrested. On July 16, some 7.2m Venezuelans rejected the assembly in an opposition-organised referendum. The attorney-general and a handful of other establishment figures have tried to dissuade Mr Maduro from pressing ahead (para. 1-3). What is a \u2018constituent assembly\u2019? In its narrowest sense, it is a body of people tasked with either writing or modifying a constitution. Perhaps the most famous example is the group of men who drew up the US constitution in 1787. Usually, once such an assembly has finished its job, it is dissolved. That is what happened in post-partition India, for example, and in Italy after the second world war (para. 5). Who can vote on July 30 and who are the candidates? Everyone on Venezuela\u2019s electoral register \u2014 about 20m people \u2014 can cast a ballot. Voters will elect 364 members to the assembly in a municipal vote. Each of the country\u2019s 335 municipalities will get one representative with the exception of the 23 state capitals, which get two each, and Caracas, which will have seven (para. 11). The opposition and analysts say the municipal vote is skewed in the government\u2019s favour because it gives sparsely-populated rural municipalities, where Mr Maduro has most support, the same weight as urban municipalities where the opposition is stronger. In addition to these 364 representatives, 181 candidates will be elected by different sectors of society, bringing the total to 545. Students, for example, will choose 24 members via sectoral elections in which only students can take part. Workers get 79, pensioners 28, indigenous people eight, and so on. Business people get five. Again, the opposition says this system is arbitrary and will favour the government (para 11-13). Long, G. (2017). What would a new constitution mean for Venezuela? The Financial Times. World.

Brent crude futures were at $49.10 per barrel at 0454 GMT, up 18 cents, or 0.4 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $46.70 per barrel, up 16 cents, or 0.3 percent. Both benchmarks extended gains from strong performances last week. Analysts said the rising prices were a result of strong demand as well as signs that a relentless climb in U.S. oil production was slowing. \"The slowing pace of increases combined with massive drawdowns last week on both official crude inventory numbers from the U.S. probably explains the positive sentiment in general at the moment,\" said Jeffrey Halley of futures brokerage OANDA in Singapore (para. 1-6).

After months of street rallies that have led to nearly 100 deaths, the Democratic Unity coalition brought millions onto the streets on Sunday for an informal referendum intended to de-legitimize a leader they call a dictator. Now, opposition leaders are promising \"Zero Hour\" in Venezuela to demand a general election and stop the leftist Maduro's plan to create a controversial new legislative super-body called a Constituent Assembly in a July 30 vote. Opposition tactics could include lengthy road blockades and sit-ins, a national strike, or possibly even a march on the Miraflores presidential palace, similar to events before a short-lived coup against Maduro's successor Hugo Chavez in 2002. \"Today, Venezuela stood up with dignity to say freedom does not go backwards, democracy is not negotiated,\" Julio Borges, who leads the opposition-controlled legislature, said shortly after midnight when the referendum results were announced (para. 1-5).

The symbolic poll, which will also ask voters if they want early elections, is intended to further dent Maduro's legitimacy amid a crippling economic crisis and three months of anti-government protests that have led to nearly 100 deaths.

But the vote does not appear to augur a short-term change of government or a solution to the country's political stalemate. Maduro, 54, says Sunday's plebiscite is illegal and meaningless. Instead, the leftist leader is campaigning for an official July 30 vote for the new assembly, which will be able to rewrite the constitution and dissolve state institutions. \"(Even with) rain, thunder or lightning, Sunday's poll will go ahead!\" said opposition leader Henrique Capriles in a Friday evening broadcast. \"We Venezuelans are going out to vote for the future, the fatherland and the freedom of Venezuela.\" Voters will be asked three questions: if they reject the constitutional assembly, if they want the armed forces to defend the existing constitution and if they want elections before Maduro's term in office ends in 2018 (para. 1-7).

S&P reduced the nation\u2019s long-term foreign and local currency ratings to CCC-, or three notches below investment grade, from CCC on Tuesday. The New York-based company kept its negative outlook for Venezuela, signaling room for further downgrades. Fitch Ratings and Moody\u2019s Investors Service also rank the country at speculative levels. \"Recent developments have raised the risk of default, including through a debt exchange that we would view as a distressed exchange, within the next six months, absent unanticipated significant improvement in Venezuela\u2019s economic and political conditions,\" S&P analysts led by Manuel Orozco wrote in a statement on Tuesday.

The world\u2019s largest drillers failed to take advantage of high prices during the boom years before 2014 to repay debt, according to the report published on Tuesday. Instead they embarked on costly investments in new projects and dividends, leaving them unprepared for the painful downturn that ensued. Now, a weak recovery in oil prices is making it harder to reduce the debt accumulated in recent years. Exxon last year lost the platinum credit rating it held since the Great Depression, and all of its largest rivals, including Total SA, BP Plc, and Royal Dutch Shell Plc also faced similar reductions. Further downgrades could become more likely later this year or in 2018 if oil prices remain below $50 a barrel, the report said (para. 1-3). Get-Out-of-Jail \"The modest improvement in oil prices this year reflects the support from the OPEC and Russian agreement to constrain production,\" Simon Redmond, director of corporate ratings for commodities at S&P, wrote in the report. \"But it hardly offers a get-out-of-jail-free card for ratings\" (para. 6). S&P warned Exxon seven weeks ago that the explorer\u2019s balance sheet was under strain, degrading the oil producer\u2019s outlook to negative. The rating company said it worried Exxon may \u201cprioritize capital spending, acquisitions or shareholder returns over debt reduction.\u201d Total, Exxon, and Chevron face the greatest danger of a ratings cut, given their elevated debt loads and lackluster efforts to curtail investments and dividend payouts. An exception to the trend is Shell, the only company among the five to receive a positive outlook from S&P. Shell outperformed its peers last year, putting it in a better position than its rivals to cut costs as prices remain low. An agreement by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut production is proving unable so far to significantly raise prices and diminish a global supply glut. Oil companies may choose to prioritize debt reduction by selling off assets and winding down long-term investments, Harvey said. Alternatively, they could seek more acquisitions to lock in profitability at lower prices, such as BP investing in fields in continental Africa (para. 6-9). Tognini, G. (2017).

The state company already offered Russian oil major Rosneft (ROSN.MM) a stake in a joint venture in an extra-heavy crude project in the Orinoco Belt, sources told Reuters in March. The sources, who asked to remain anonymous because they are not authorized to speak about the negotiations, said PDVSA was still negotiating with ONGC and no deal was certain. Under Venezuela's hydrocarbon law, the state must maintain more than 50 percent of all oil ventures, hence PDVSA can only offer up to 9 percent to the Indian firm (para. 1-8). Verma, N. & Ulmer, A.

No salary increase can stop the economic catastrophe that the country is going through: a rate of inflation that exceeds 700 percent due to a huge fiscal deficit financed with freshly printed money; scarcity of food and medicines due both to a lack of foreign currency to import and a destroyed productive sector after decades of brutal regulation; and an external debt that would require over five years of exports to be paid in its totality, which is bringing the country to brink of default (para. 1-2). Therefore, there are two possible scenarios that could unfold: The first is that Maduro goes on with his plan to rewrite and introduce a new constitution, ignoring the will of the vast majority of Venezuelans. In this scenario, he would manage to survive this crisis and stay in power for the foreseeable future as a ruthless dictator with a new constitution that fits this purpose (para. 6). Venezuela\u2019s economic standing would only get worse in this situation. While the government keeps waiting for some miraculous sharp increase in the price of oil, it will keep finding ways to finance its survival (and to line the pockets of government officials). This means it would keep emptying its foreign reserves and mortgaging the state\u2019s domestic and foreign assets in exchange for more financing, here and there, until no longer possible. The government's absurd socialist policies will keep foreign investment away, thus further hindering the recoveries of the private sector and the oil industry. But under this scenario, something has to give: With fewer and fewer sources of income, the government will eventually have no other choice but to default on its sovereign foreign debt, raising the humanitarian crisis to a whole new level. The second scenario, the one the vast majority of Venezuelans would like to see play out, involves the restoration of democracy and an eventual transition of power to a democratically elected government. Under this scenario, the economic situation won\u2019t be solved immediately, but Venezuelans will see a light at the end of the tunnel (para. 6-9). Bahar, D.

The latest arm-twisting by the government promises to heat up a more than three-month-old confrontation between the Maduro regime and thousands in the opposition, and which has already claimed 90 lives. Maduro\u2019s ballot-box demands came just a day after government forces allowed pro-regime thugs to storm into the National Assembly, the last bastion for the anti-Maduro opposition, and beat up opposition lawmakers. In his attempt to remain in office, Maduro is looking to his base of state employees, and lower income Venezuelans, for support. But he\u2019s not asking, he\u2019s telling. \u201cIf there are 15,000 workers, all 15,000 workers must vote without any excuses,\u201d Reuters reported him saying in Bolivar on Thursday. The state workforce, which makes up about 10 percent of Venezuela\u2019s population, has been coerced by the government before. In 2016, Maduro ordered a purge of employees at five key government ministries who signed a petition backing a referendum to recall the President from office.

Crude ended the quarter 9% lower, and sank as much as 21.9% in June from highs in February. A loss of 20% or more typically signals the start of a bear market. It is a sharp shift from the first months of 2017, when investors had been divided over whether members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would stick to pledges to cut output, but generally believed those cuts would help ease the global supply glut and lift prices. For a time, it seemed almost nothing could shake oil investors out of their malaise. Prices fell even after OPEC announced it would extend its cuts into next year and the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that U.S. stockpiles fell nearly every week during the quarter. At the same time, U.S. output has risen more quickly than many predicted: The EIA is now forecasting that it will average a record of 10 million barrels a day next year. Output from Libya and Nigeria, OPEC members exempt from the production-cut agreements, has ramped up as well (para. 1-6). Saudi Arabia, OPEC\u2019s de facto leader, has a lot riding on higher oil prices. The country is targeting oil prices of $60 a barrel to smooth the way for the initial public offering of Saudi Aramco, its national oil company. That is one reason some investors still hope that OPEC will make deeper cuts (para. 13). Citigroup is among the firms that believe the market is actually getting tighter, but the firm\u2019s analysts say for now, negative sentiment could be hard to shake. Citi analysts say the chances that Brent crude futures will climb to $60 by the end of the year are less than 50%, down from their previous estimate of a 65% chance. Brent settled at $47.92 Friday. \u201cThe fund community has been burned so badly as to reduce the likelihood of them jumping back in no matter what the fundamentals,\u201d the analysts wrote in a June 26 research note.

On her last trip, they made a good haul, securing seven tons of flour, sugar and cooking oil from the former British colony in exchange for fresh shrimp from home. But on the way back their rickety 46-foot boat capsized, leaving Ms. Revilla and her companions clinging to the wreckage for nearly two days before she and two others ran out of strength and drowned, according to survivors. Her stepfather says her 3-year-old daughter, Isabel, keeps asking, \u201cWhere is my mama?\u201d As Venezuela\u2019s economy crumbles, an increasingly desperate people are doing all they can to get food and medicine. Here that can involve great peril. Venezuelans make trips as long as 10 hours to hawk shellfish, plastic chairs, house doors, ceramic pots and even exotic animals like iguanas and brightly feathered macaws. They are exchanged for basic goods\u2014rice, detergent, diapers\u2014that Caracas is increasingly unable to provide. \u201cIt\u2019s thanks to Trinidad that we have any food here,\u201d said 49-year-old Angela Caballero, a resident of this town on a peninsula that extends toward the island. \u201cIf that didn\u2019t come, we\u2019d be dead.\u201d A decade ago, Venezuela\u2019s late strongman, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, promoted bartering to boost food production and create \u201ca socialist market, a market of equals.\u201d But today, many of his compatriots in far-flung towns like Irapa have a different take on that direct approach to the marketplace. \u201cThis is savage capitalism,\u201d town councilman Guillermo Mendoza said. \u201cThe role of the government in this is to just keep quiet.\u201d Venezuelan and Trinidadian officials didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment on the cross-border barter trade. Such evidence of economic desperation is an embarrassment for Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s heir, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who denies the country is in a crisis. Trinidad, meanwhile, recently signed a deal with its larger neighbor to develop a major offshore gas field. Venezuelan fishermen have been making weekly trips to Trinidad since food scarcities intensified two years ago, said Eutaquio Fern\u00e1ndez, captain of that ill-fated boat. As the cash-strapped government slashes imports, Irapa residents say food rations meant to last a week reach them barely once every two months.

A country that was once one of Latin America\u2019s wealthiest is seeing its democratic institutions collapse, leading to levels of disease, hunger and dysfunction more often seen in war-torn nations than oil-rich ones. Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s successor, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, has called for a National Constitutional Assembly to be elected on July 30 to draft a new constitution, in which ill-defined communal councils will take the place of Venezuela\u2019s traditional governing institutions, such as state governments and the opposition-dominated Congress. The new assembly appears to be rigged to heavily represent groups that back the government. The Maduro government says that the new assembly will find a peaceful way forward for a country enduring an economic depression and standing on the brink of civil conflict. The government says it is building on the legacy of Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, a military man who vowed to fight corruption, dismantle the venal old political establishment and be a voice for millions of poor Venezuelans. But the opposition, which is boycotting the assembly vote, calls it a naked attempt to end democracy and turn the country into a Cuba-style communist autocracy. The government\u2019s own attorney general calls the vote illegal. The 545-member assembly, a modern-day soviet, would hold unlimited power while it writes a new governing charter, which could take years. Meantime, the assembly is widely expected to scrap next year\u2019s presidential elections. \u201cThis is the last battle for democracy in Venezuela,\u201d says David Smilde, a Venezuela expert at Tulane University. For the U.S., the prospect of a new Cuba sitting atop trillions of dollars of oil reserves is profoundly unpleasant. For the past decade, Venezuela has aligned itself with Russia, China, Iran and Syria. Whether it thrives or implodes, Mr. Maduro\u2019s petrostate could cause far greater headaches to the U.S. and Latin America than isolated Cuba. An implosion could mean bigger shipments of cocaine to Central America and the U.S., as well as a massive increase in the current flow of tens of thousands of refugees already fleeing the country for the U.S., Colombia, Brazil and elsewhere. And a consolidation of power could let Mr. Maduro deepen his partnership with U.S. adversaries. The Trump administration has criticized Mr. Maduro\u2019s plans to change the constitution, urging \u201crespect for democratic norms and processes.\u201d The U.S. has called for Venezuela to free political prisoners, respect the opposition-controlled congress and \u201chold free and democratic elections.\u201d Mr. Maduro\u2019s move has aggravated Venezuela\u2019s political crisis. The opposition, sensing a do-or-die moment, plans to ramp up daily street protests.

The aircraft fired 15 shots at the Interior Ministry, where scores of people were at a social event, and dropped four grenades on the court, where judges were meeting, officials said. However, there were no reports of injuries. \"Sooner rather than later, we are going to capture the helicopter and those behind this armed terrorist attack against the institutions of the country,\" Maduro said. \"They could have caused dozens of deaths,\" he said. The 54-year-old socialist leader has faced three months of protests from opposition leaders who decry him as a dictator who has wrecked a once-prosperous economy. There has been growing dissent too from within government and the security forces. At least 75 people have died, and hundreds more been injured and arrested, in the anti-government unrest since April. Demonstrators are demanding general elections, measures to alleviate a brutal economic crisis, freedom for hundreds of jailed opposition activists, and independence for the opposition-controlled National Assembly legislature. Maduro says they are seeking a coup against him with the encouragement of a U.S. government eager to gain control of Venezuela's oil reserves, the largest in the world.

But those are the home improvement plans of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who is moving forward with a provocative attempt to rewrite Venezuela\u2019s constitution despite the country\u2019s descent into political and economic catastrophe. The government has set July 30 as the date when voters will elect delegates for a constitutional assembly that will have the power to remake Venezuela\u2019s laws. Maduro insists the goal is to \u201crestore peace\u201d to the country, but the effect so far has been quite the opposite, taking a fraught situation and giving it a fuse. Maduro\u2019s opponents see his rewrite bid as a naked power grab, and they want nothing to do with it. The Democratic Unity Roundtable (MUD), Venezuela\u2019s big-tent opposition movement, says it will boycott the assembly. This past week its supporters tried to march again to the headquarters of Venezuela\u2019s election authorities, carrying signs that read \u201cThe Constitutional Assembly is a Fraud.\u201d\nBut their abstention risks giving Maduro a free hand to make sweeping legal and political changes beneath a scrim of democratic legitimacy. If the end result is an extension of Maduro\u2019s rule, analysts say, the assembly could take the country into full-blown dictatorial rule. Maduro appears to be thinking of a deadline of his own \u2014 next year\u2019s presidential election. With the economy collapsing and his approval ratings hovering around 20 percent, he has few prospects for staying in power. But changing Venezuela\u2019s constitution to postpone or cancel the election is one of them.

At its annual general assembly in Mexico this week, the OAS failed to reach consensus on a resolution about Venezuela, where 75 people have died in three months of protests. Demonstrators are demanding general elections to end 18 years of socialist rule in the once-wealthy OPEC nation, racked by rising poverty and a deepening economic and political crisis. Countries in the region have lambasted Maduro over Venezuela's situation, but they have no evident means of forcing a political transition to happen. Despite low approval ratings and the increasingly dire humanitarian situation, Maduro faces few short-term threats to his hold on power. The next presidential election is not scheduled until late next year, and military officers have until now ignored opposition calls that they urge Maduro to resign (para 1-8).\nRam\u00edrez, S.

Argentina is pre-occupied with its economic reform project; Brazil with the political instability generated by its massive corruption probe; Colombia with its peace process; Chile with imminent presidential elections; and so forth. Occasionally, though, there are moments of attempted multilateral diplomacy \u2013 such as last week\u2019s meeting of the OAS. Sadly, the session fell short of its original billing: to provide a regional response to Venezuela\u2019s escalating social, economic and political crises. A resolution condemning President Nicolas Maduro\u2019s increasing authoritarianism failed to win the 23 votes needed after most of the left-wing bloc of ALBA nations, which includes Nicaragua and Bolivia, voted against the motion, and a group of eight mostly Caribbean countries abstained. The frustration among the 20 countries that did vote for the motion \u2013 including the US, Brazil and Mexico \u2013 was palpable. \u201cWhile we are unable to agree here, in the streets of Caracas \u2026violence is continuing,\u201d rued Luis Videgaray the Mexican foreign minister. Venezuela is, indeed, a moral stain on the region. But that does not mean the OAS session was entirely in vain. The country\u2019s problems were aired publicly. The aggressive insults of Venezuela foreign minister Delcy Rodr\u00edguez confirmed the regime\u2019s recalcitrance. The objections of the abstainers (many of which enjoyed Venezuelan oil largesse in the past) were largely on procedural grounds, and they avoided going on the record either to support Maduro or to assert the principle of non-intervention. That proved wise, as the next day Venezuela presented 10 proposals on other countries\u2019 human rights records \u2013 an obvious contradiction of Caracas\u2019s own position about not prying into other countries\u2019 affairs. The last time the OAS met to discuss Venezuela, in March, a similar resolution failed. The Maduro government crowed over that \u201ctriumph\u201d too. But two days later, when the Venezuelan Supreme Court tried to take over the opposition-controlled National Assembly in a thinly-disguised coup, the international reaction was swift and furious. The government soon reversed course. July 30 is the next crunch date in the Venezuelan calendar. That is when the government will supposedly begin to re-write the constitution, and so entrench power further. Such digging in, though, is not the solution to the country\u2019s governability crisis, as the government seems to imagine. The domestic opposition is still mobilized, after over 70 days of protests. Chavismo is fracturing, as more senior officials dissent. The OAS is in permanent session over Venezuela. The US is considering further sanctions against targeted officials. And the international community is better primed to respond to Venezuela\u2019s deepening dictatorship than it was three months ago.

The solution, Guanipa tells them, is to vote against the ruling Socialist Party \u2014 which controls 20 of Venezuela's 23 states \u2014 and to elect opposition candidates like himself. It's unclear whether voters will get that chance.\nIn this oil-rich country, the socialist government used to be an electoral powerhouse; back in the 2000s, when Venezuela was flush with petrodollars, the late socialist leader Hugo Chavez and his political allies won nearly every popular vote. But Venezuela is now mired in a deep economic crisis, and that has led to a steep drop in support for President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who seems to have soured on testing the will of the people. The elections had been scheduled for last December, but have been indefinitely postponed. Critics claim the Maduro government made this decision after polls predicted that ruling party candidates would lose nearly every state. Last year, the Maduro government canceled a recall referendum that could have removed the president from power, and it has suspended voting for everything from city councils and labor unions to student governments at public universities.\nIt wasn't always like this \u2014 under Chavez, Venezuela called elections all the time with the socialists nearly always coming out on top. When Chavez died in 2013, Maduro won a snap election to replace him. \"[The Socialist Party] loved having elections when they used to win them,\" says Phil Gunson, a Venezuela analyst for the International Crisis Group. \"They used to boast all the time: 'We've had 18 elections and 17 of them we've won.

Financial disaster and default appear likely within two quarters, while support for Maduro's new constitution is meeting opposition from traditional allies. An increasingly large coalition of protesters occupy the streets despite a climbing death toll, further eroding support from Maduro's allies. These factors make it likely that Maduro will be deposed by either a coup (see Egypt) or popular opposition (see Ukraine) within the next six to eight months. Maduro seems intent on remaining in power no matter the cost to his country and people, meaning that he must be forcibly deposed or made to flee if he believes a collapse or coup to be imminent. To facilitate either case, Maduro must lose support from key allies in power--namely the military. Military chief and Defense Minister Vladimir Lopez was given vast powers over the nations economy, defense, and infrastructure last year (1). For now, he is the linchpin of Maduro's support, but would likely facilitate a coup if Maduro fails to save the economy or deal with political pressure (an Egypt 2014 or Thailand 2014 scenario). I believe deposition by popular opposition is possible (a Tunisia or Ukraine scenario) but slightly less likely. Given the current economic situation in Venezuela, a full default would likely spell doom for Maduro's remaining legitimacy. In @chwang 's superb financial analysis, the Goldman lifeline will not be enough to stave off collapse. Even counting on Russian and potentially Chinese assistance (I'm alluding to a recent shipment of vehicles from Chinese defense manufacturer Norinco), the Maduro regime has not been able stop the hemorrhaging economy. A collapse would be catastrophic for Maduro, and would likely lead to a defection of key allies and his deposition.  I again repeat @chwang 's analysis that collapse will likely happen within two quarters, placing the timeline before 2018--possibly sooner as Maduro (or key supporters) would be the first to see the final writing on the wall. However, the political situation may hasten Maduro's departure. Maduro is basing a significant portion of his remaining political capital on rewriting the constitution instituted by Chavez. This is his last political lifeline to power, and its failure would probably result in government stagnation and the eventual deposition of Maduro. Along with heavy opposition external to the government, traditional allies are balking at this move on the grounds that it departs from Chavez's legacy, seriously undermining Maduro's legitimacy (2). I believe that a failure to rewrite the constitution will occur within the next 3 months.  Increasing pressure from the streets also needs to be factored in, as protests show no sign of abating. The middle class and other traditional sources of chavista support appear to be joining protests, and the politically important Catholic Church has abandoned Maduro (3).  In only 6 months of 2017, the human cost has also risen to 150% of 2014 casualties, and a recent letter from Maduro to the Pope only highlights the terrible optics of the regime's murder of children (4). This begs the question of how long allies will continue to support Maduro as the death toll rises and they consider the consequences of turning on the regime too late (a Ukraine situation).  Indeed, reports highlighted by @sevedb indicate that sections of the military are expressing dissent and are being arrested by security forces. Together, these political pressures will serve to isolate Maduro and likely lead to his ouster. The synergy of an impending financial collapse, internal opposition to a new constitution, defection of traditional supporters, and increased pressure from protesters indicate that the regime is at a breaking point. The Venezuelan crisis appears set for a crescendo this summer and Maduro is increasingly isolated. I therefore believe it most likely that he will be ousted before October 1, 2017, though it is possible that he makes it into early 2018.

I have a link below to an interesting analysis of when this happens but the overriding point is that as long as low level soldiers are willing to keep killing civilians, even large numbers of civilians. the government is not going to fall. The government's finances today feel similar (at my cursory reading) to those of Zimbabwe or Syria where most things have broken down but the security services are still being paid, at least high level members are. The second link (in Spanish, sorry about that) describes how more than 100 members of the military have been detained so I think the government is weaker than it seems.

As of Feb 2017, the World Bank estimated that Venezuela's debt:GDP ratio exceeded 20% and required at least $25-35 billion in foreign financing. Crushing obligations have forced Maduro's government to resort to deep discounting of bonds to Goldman Sachs & Nomura Bank (0.31x), selling of potentially unauthorized bonds (via Haitong Securities USA), illegal withholding of foreign airline revenue, artificial price controls, currency manipulation, and >700% hyperinflation/annually. What this translates to is a sharp increase in the percent of poor/extremely poor Venezuelans over the past 5 years (from ~35% to >75%), severe food shortages even among government employees, constant protests, military abandonment of posts, rampant crime, and civil breakdown. At this rate, I estimate that Venezuela will need to raise $6-8 billion from external sources each quarter to keep functioning. But potential sources are dwindling. After the recent Goldman purchase, many countries, banks, and investors condemned them morally. This will provide a chilling effect on other entities considering investing in high-risk sovereign bonds. With the continued collapse in oil prices for the foreseeable future, the prospect of Maduro raising this amount of capital is highly doubtful.

And in Latin American history, Colombia, Venezuela's neighbor, suffered a decade of civil war and unrest during the 1950's known as \"La Violenc\u00eda,\" spawning the various guerrilla movements (FARC, ELN, etc.). In other words, violence, especially political violence, has a long history of lasting for long periods. So I'd be surprised if this resolved itself quickly in the next few months.

The face amount bought represents more than 90 percent of the $3 billion issue\nVenezuela's economy has been in precipitous decline since Mr. Maduro succeeded Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in 2013.
