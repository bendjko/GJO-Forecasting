As it turns out, under the Iran nuclear deal or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), there are now limitations on what the IAEA is allowed to report. According to Amano, due to new U.N. Security Council and IAEA resolutions, the agency will only monitor and verify Iran\u2019s compliance with its JCPOA commitments and will no longer provide broad reporting on its nuclear program. A December 15, 2015, IAEA Board of Governors resolution directed the organization to cease reporting on Iran\u2019s compliance with its Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty obligations and past Security Council resolutions because the Board of Governors is no longer seized of this matter (para 1).

The Strait of Hormuz is a maritime channel that joins the Persian Gulf to the Sea of Oman. Iran is located on the north shores of the Strait, and Oman on its south shores. Straits can separate two adjacent landmasses, as the Strait of Dover, which separate France. In that case, the separation is political rather than geographical. Straits can connect adjacent landmasses as well. Although the Strait of Hormuz separates Iran and Oman, it is at the same time a channel connecting them to each other. Tis has had a major impact on their relationship.\nSo far, the Strait of Hormuz and its various, important aspects have been the subject of many books and papers. Ali Asghar Kazemi considers the legal regime of the Strait of Hormuz in his book entitled, The Legal Aspects of Iran\u2019s Sovereignty in the Persian Gulf the book entitled, the Persian Gulf and the Strategic Role of the Strait of Hormuz written by M. R. Hafeznia, discusses the natural, political, strategic and geopolitical aspects of the Strait of Hormuz. Homayoun Elahi allocates a chapter of his book, the Persian Gulf and its Problems, to the geographical and legal particularities of the Straits. The book entitled the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean in International Politics, written by Abbas Amiri, contains chapters on the policies of major and regional powers towards the Persian Gulf and the importance of the oil in the region for the world economy (Amiri, 1975). Ruhollah Ramazani, too, in his book, the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz, discusses the role of the Strait in the world economy, the policies of the United States and Russia towards the Persian Gulf and the Strait\u2019s crises (1979) (\u00b6 1-2).

Add it to the long list of other threatening post-deal developments, including the intensification of Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program, the continuation of its efforts to illicitly procure nuclear materials, and the expansion of its aggressive and destabilizing activities across the Middle East.

I expect the recent intensified pace of escalated cards being played, or threatened to be played, in anticipation of the fall of Mosul and the internal political-economic arrangement within Iraq (not least of all future access the oil reserves nearby Mosul and Kirkuk), to continue. Thus, whether Iran will be called upon to demonstrate their willingness to play this card (on an initial small, demonstratory scale) will be contingent upon the actual direction of the resolution of the Iraqi issues. At the moment, the Iraqi government appears to be committed in a direction that would (from how little I really know) seem to be satisfactory to Iran, so my initial forecast will be low. I would not expect Iran to obtain its objectives uncontested however, so my estimate is not too low. I would suspect that Iran will, if necessary, indeed play this card fully if they determine it to be necessary, with or without a preliminary demonstration. A creative aside: Ever since Politico published that story about a retired U.S. general suggesting that Obama may be \"pushing\" the Mosul offensive, and found other \"senior military officials\" to put an actual October start date on the offensive, they and others are promoting the notion of the re-taking of Mosul as being a possible \"October Surprise\" type of event. I think such an analogy is a bit of a stretch because, in my opinion, the vast majority of Americans (90%?) have no idea where Mosul is, what it's relevance is to anything in their lives is, and honestly, couldn't care one way or the other. Not sufficient in itself to \"defeat ISIS,\" the media, no matter how hard they tried, couldn't push that lead balloon anywhere near to where it would make one iota of difference in the election.
