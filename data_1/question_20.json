An average of polls taken after the first-round election strongly suggests a Macri victory. See http://buenosairesherald.com/article/202952/polls-put-macri-ahead\n\"Polls put Macri ahead\nNine out of 10 surveys point to a Let\u2019s Change victory\nEight days out from the presidential runoff, an aggregate of polls suggests that Let\u2019s Change presidential candidate Mauricio Macri will be able to convert his strong second-place finish into a victory against rival Daniel Scioli of the Victory Front (FpV) in the November 22 runoff. Scioli edged Macri in the general elections last month by about three percentage points but polls on taken since the election consistently placed the Let\u2019s Change candidate with a lead of between two and 11 points. La Borra, a blog run by political scientists who aggregates polls, has placed the average margin held by Macri over Scioli to be around six percentage points. The average is drawn from 10 polls, all of which were carried out after the October 25 general election. Nine out of those 10 indicated that Macri is in pole position to replace President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner at the Pink House.\" On the other hand, there is still a lot of uncertainty in the polling: See the same article: http://buenosairesherald.com/article/202952/polls-put-macri-ahead\n\"Ahead of the general elections, the vast majority of publicly-available surveys suggested that Scioli was on the cusp of the 10-point margin required to win the presidency outright. Those predictions proved to be totally off base. The only pollster to have come close to the final was result was the consultancy Elypsis, which correctly predicted a runoff. Elypsis published results only days after the election which gave Macri a 10-point lead over Scioli. One of the reasons given by analysts is that the surveys were unable to account for the increased turnout between the primaries and the runoff. The runoff will also pose new kinds of problems for the pollsters as the more than five million voters who voted for defeated presidential candidates have the option of casting a blank vote \u2014 determining how exactly voters realign their support in the unique circumstances of a runoff will add a layer of complexity.\" And see: http://en.mercopress.com/2015/11/14/argentine-analyst-says-8-decide-their-vote-on-election-day\n\"\u201cI believe there is a majority of Massa voters who will support Macri. But one thing are the Massa votes in Cordoba and another those in La Matanza, a Buenos Aires province district, who really believe Scioli is the only one capable or reining the province, and not some other hopeful\u201d. Likewise Giacobbe said it was in \u201cScioli's interest that less voters turn out on 22 November when the runoff, while for Macri the opposite is best, the more voters the better so he can overtake the small difference he experienced in October\u201d. But above all \u201cwe must remember that 70% of voters act on a rather reasonable logic, while for 30% it's like choosing between Frankenstein and the wolf man, since they do not like or feel comfortable with any of the two candidates\u201d. Giacobbe also recalled that despite what opinion polls might be indicating, experience shows that in runoffs the difference is normally just a few percentage points, no matter the candidates,\" Other sources: http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/11/14/uk-argentina-election-idUKKCN0T310L20151114\n\"The poll, conducted by Management & Fit and published in newspaper Clarin, gave Macri about an 8 percentage point advantage over ruling party candidate Daniel Scioli, the governor of Buenos Aires province, who has been endorsed by Fernandez. In the survey Macri got a voter intention rating of 52 percent versus 43.7 percent for Scioli, factoring in each candidate's projected share of undecided voters. The poll of 2,400 voters taken last week had a margin of error of plus of minus 3 percent.

Main factor Scoli does not need many more votes, and Kirchner's support and ability to make deals should make the difference. Analysis of the Argentine political parties:\n The Peronist Movement has two wings: the Pro Kirchner wing (Scioli) and the Anti Kirchner wing (Massa). Both wings fundamentally agree on the basic Peronist concepts: support of the working class and the poor.  Together they gained 60% of the primary vote.  In a second round vote these are the most likely candidates to win. The Cambios Alliance (Macri): Pro business candidate supports free markets and US tendencies.  Gained 30% of primary vote, but has very little upside. Scioli seems like the only candidate that can win outright in the first round of voting in October. That is a positive. Kirchner supports Scioli, although he is not seen as at loyalist.  By selecting Carlos Zannini, close confidant of Kirchner, as his VP candidate, he may have both the pro and some anti Kerchner vote in a second round.  Scioli reportedly has opportunity to cut deals for the few remaining votes to win in the first round. Other outcomes: mostly based on an alliance between Cambios and United for a New Alternative (UNA , Massa).  Assuming it is unlikely that Cambios can win on it's own, the Anti-Kirchner  (Massa) wing should have the most influence.  Combined this combination drew almost 51% in the primary vote.  Macri couldhe presidency as a figurehead, as Cambios will not have the votes in Parliament to exercise much power.  More likely Massa would be able to supply more Parliamentary support, if this were to be a coalition.\n"], [191, "2015-09-14T19:57:08Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.15, 0.85], ""], [90, "2015-09-14T18:46:24Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.45, 0.55], "For now."], [710, "2015-09-14T13:18:38Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.9], ""], [563, "2015-09-14T00:54:39Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.15, 0.75], "Who wants austerity."], [563, "2015-09-14T00:53:26Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.15, 0.75], "Who wants austerity.
