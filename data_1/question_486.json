Also, vehicles and weapons belonging to the militants were destroyed.\" Comments: See above. Are we going back to this tired standard of measure again? Yep, me thinks we are.\nBody Count: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_count\nVietnam War\nSince the goal of the United States in the Vietnam War was not to conquer North Vietnam but rather to ensure the survival of the South Vietnamese government, measuring progress was difficult. All the contested territory was theoretically \"held\" already. Instead, the US Army used body counts to show that the US was winning the war. The Army's theory was that eventually, the Vietcong and North Vietnamese Army would lose after the attrition warfare.\nAccording to historian Christian Appy, \"search and destroy was the principal tactic; and the enemy body count was the primary measure of progress\" in General Westmoreland\u2019s war of attrition. Search and destroy was coined as a phrase in 1965 to describe missions aimed at flushing the Viet Cong out of hiding, while the body count was the measuring stick for the success of any operation. Competitions were held between units for the highest number of Vietnamese killed in action, or KIAs. Army and marine officers knew that promotions were largely based on confirmed kills. The pressure to produce confirmed kills resulted in massive fraud. One study revealed that 61 % of American commanders considered that body counts were grossly exaggerated.\nIn 1946, Ho Chi Minh said, in reference to the French, \"You can kill ten of our men for every one we kill of yours. But even at those odds, you will lose and we will win.\" Some analysis of war casualties indicated that the US and its allies inflicted roughly a three-to-two ratio of communist combat deaths against allied deaths. Eventually, the US signed the Paris Peace Accords and pulled out.\"\nThe Vietnamese government reported 849,018 NVA/NLF combatants died during the war, while 58,220 Americans and about 313,000 South Vietnamese combatants died in the conflict. The official US Department of Defense figure was 950,765 communist forces killed in Vietnam from 1965 to 1974. Defense Department officials believed that these body count figures need to be deflated by 30 percent.\" Comments: Highly adaptable enemy.\nWatertown Daily Times, March 31, 'Resurgent Taliban gets hands on high-tech gear, putting U.S. in bind': http://www.watertowndailytimes.com/national/resurgent-taliban-gets-hands-on-high-tech-gear-putting-us-in-bind-20180331\nClips from Watertown article:\n\"As some of this equipment falls into Taliban hands, the militants are joining a larger trend, said David W.

But over the last year, the night-vision devices have frequently turned up in the country\u2019s north and east, according to two U.S. military officials, signaling a widespread distribution into other groups of Taliban fighters.\nThose officials said the Taliban were using both tightly controlled U.S.-made devices and gear that is widely available for purchase. In some cases, U.S. officials said, the equipment was left on the battlefield by American or Afghan troops, including those who were killed in action. In others, Afghan soldiers are believed to have sold the devices to the extremists.\nThat was disputed by Gen. Dawlat Waziri, who until recently served as spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of Defense.

In his view, the U.S. military has been assigned a \"mission impossible\" in Afghanistan.\nThe weak central government in Kabul and the resilient Taliban insurgency are not the U.S. military's only problems there. It also faces what Gen. Joseph Votel, the top U.S. general overseeing the war, calls interference by Russia. He told a congressional panel last month that Moscow is seeking to undermine U.S. and NATO influence in Afghanistan by exaggerating the presence of Islamic State fighters there and portraying this as a U.S. failure.\" \"Dan Coats, the director of U.S. national intelligence, offered a less optimistic forecast when he testified to the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday.\n\"We assess the overall security picture will ... modestly deteriorate in the coming year and Kabul will continue to bear the brunt of the Taliban-led insurgency,\" Coats said. Afghan forces, while \"unsteady,\" probably will maintain control of most major population centers in 2018, he added.\nTestifying at the same hearing, Army Lt. Gen. Robert Ashley, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, offered a mixed outlook. He forecast that Afghan forces this year will continue to develop offensive combat power. But he also predicted the Taliban will \"threaten Afghan stability, undermine public confidence by conducting intermittent high-profile attacks in urban areas,\" increase its influence in rural areas and threaten district centers.\" @lsgold7 , @AB747\nFrom PBS News Hour.

This IS is composed of illegal Pakistani groups,\u201d Taqat told VOA. \u201cThey [IS] are the Haqqanis, members of Lashka-e-Taiba, Sepah-e-Sahaba, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, Jaish-e-Moahmmad, Harakat-ul-Islam and etc. And now Pakistan\u2019s Inter-Services Intelligence [ISI] gave them a new name.\u201d BBC, January 13, 'Why Pakistan won't share intelligence with the US': http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-42664019\nClips from BBC article:\n\"But a conflict of interest between the two countries emerged after the 11 September 2001 attack on the US. The Americans set up a physical presence in Afghanistan and began to use Pakistan as its supply route as well as a source of ground intelligence.\nThe apparent arrangement was one in which the US would use technology - such as communication intercepts and drones - for intelligence gathering, and Pakistan would provide human intelligence.\nThe value of the relationship lay in the fact that Islamist militants, who were the US' chief adversary, were concentrated in the border region of north-west Pakistan and could only be defeated with Pakistan's help.\nThe problem in the relationship was that during the 1980s, Pakistan had learned to use these groups to wipe out Indian influence from Afghanistan. As such, it could not afford to lose that leverage.\nSo while Pakistan publicly announced that it was siding with the US-led coalition in Afghanistan, in reality it created conditions for those groups to infiltrate Pakistani territory and carve out sanctuaries in its Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata), along the border with Afghanistan.\nAs such, while Pakistanis did provide information to help the US take out or capture several al-Qaeda leaders in its tribal region, no major Taliban or Haqqani network leaders - whom Pakistan was using as its proxies in Afghanistan - were ever given away.\" \"But while all the elements Pakistan considers \"noxious\" to its interests have been pushed over the border into Afghanistan, the \"friendly\" elements remain unharmed, and sightings of important Taliban commanders are not infrequent in main Pakistani cities such as Quetta, Peshawar, Karachi and even the capital Islamabad.\" Comments: Perception, per @AB747 comments in earlier posts.

Although the Venezuelan government has not released key economic data since January 2016, the International Monetary Fund forecasts that the economy will contract by 6 percent next year, after suffering a 12 percent decline in 2017. This has been coupled with a sharp decline in food imports and the steady erosion of the country\u2019s currency; in just the past year, Venezuela\u2019s bolivar has weakened nearly 98 percent against the U.S. dollar. Not surprisingly, this has triggered a wave of woes including rising violent crime rates, a spike in malnutrition and the spread of preventable diseases such as tuberculosis. President Nicolas Maduro shows no sign that he\u2019s willing to reach an accommodation with his political opponents, so an already fraught situation might soon turn into a full-blown political and humanitarian crisis\u2014potentially involving mass protests and a more violent government crackdown\u2014on a scale that the U.S. has not had to deal with in the Wetsern Hemisphere for at least the past two decades.\"\nComments: See my comments on opium trafficking. \"A few other states with outsize importance that are at risk of rapid deterioration include the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, Pakistan, Egypt and Lebanon.\nWhen states collapse, they often create shock waves beyond their borders\u2014such as the dramatic spike in human displacement, which as of last June was at 66 million people worldwide and rising. When the final estimates are tallied, 2017 will mark the single greatest year for human displacement since World War II. These stunning refugee flows reflect the intense degree of instability in the world today, but they also drive more of it\u2014posing a serious challenge to the political stability of countries from Europe to Southeast Asia.\nMeanwhile, the simultaneous collapse of various countries\u2019 health care systems is heightening the potential for the spread of infectious diseases, such as Ebola, the Zika virus and the Plague, which have demonstrated an uncanny ability to transit borders rapidly and with little warning. During the recent West African Ebola epidemic, for example, the first cases of the virus were recorded in Guinea in late 2013, and in less than 21 months had affected nearly 30,000 people across six countries.\nIt\u2019s clearly impossible to forecast precisely when or where a tipping point will be reached in a refugee crisis or a disease outbreak, but as we enter the new year, international relief agencies are already stretched to the breaking point, and many first asylum countries (particularly Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey) have little remaining capacity to accept additional refugees. So, policymakers would be wise to start thinking in earnest now about how the U.S. government is positioned to respond to the sudden emergence in the coming year of a new refugee crisis or global pandemic.\nComments: Mass migration and infectious diseases. Rising probability that bad actors will attempt to use that combination as an attack mechanism. A third, less visible threat is the risk of an incidental clash involving U.S. forces and the potential for it to escalate unintentionally into a broader crisis. As the Trump administration has increased the scope and pace of U.S. military operations globally, it has also placed U.S. troops within increasingly close proximity to potentially hostile forces. In Syria, U.S. forces accompanying Syrian Democratic Forces\u2014mostly Kurdish groups opposed to the Syrian regime\u2014 have been routinely operating within only a few miles of Assad regime, Russian and Iranian units. And in the skies above, this threat was recently highlighted when two U.S. Air Force attack aircraft flying east of the Euphrates River narrowly avoided a collision with an oncoming Russian aircraft that was only 300 feet away.\nIn Iraq, meanwhile, U.S. advisers are routinely operating within a few miles of Iranian elements (including Iranian-backed Shia militia), and in some cases are virtually co-located with them. And as the U.S. Navy has routinized its freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea, it\u2019s regularly operating within a short distance of Chinese military forces\u2014much to Beijing\u2019s intense chagrin.\nWhile there are sound military reasons for these deployments and processes in place in both the Middle East and the South China Sea to avoid accidental contact, the presence of U.S. and hostile forces operating in such close quarters clearly heightens the risk of an accident\u2014recall the Hainan Island incident, which involved a midair collision between a U.S. P-3 and Chinese fighter jet in 2001, and which triggered an intense, 11-day diplomatic stalemate that threatened to derail U.S.-China relations. Even when nobody desires a conflict, such incidents are difficult to prevent and control.\" Posted on the IC forum a couple of days ago:\nSenior Intelligence Analyst - active clearance not required\nemail resume to Maya@theintellcomm.com and upload it at www.intelljobs.com\nWe are looking for a Senior Intelligence Analyst to work in a highly autonomous yet collaborative environment with a world-class team.

This support is critical to long-term stability and cannot be imposed from the top down, but must be earned by deeds that are basically democratic in nature.\n\u2022 Security is essential for political stability; but without political progress, security will not endure. For the United States, carrying out an effective political strategy with skilled civilian advisory assistance, as well as wise, effective military advice, can be critical.\n\u2022 Protection of the population (as stressed in the current U.S. armed forces counterinsurgency manual) and winning its support is necessary for success. Although only indigenous governments can ultimately win this kind of struggle, well-informed and wise U.S. support and advice can be essential.\n\u2022 Success in providing effective help for host-government counterinsurgency is proportional to the amount of mental effort devoted by us to understanding the nature of the country, the aspirations of its people and the insurgent enemy.\n\u2022 A completely integrated U.S. civilian-military advisory effort is ideal. However, in the current and probable future circumstances of less massive U.S. interventions, our counterinsurgency support needs to be a collegial venture marked by close interagency cooperation with a combined political, military and development focus. There also needs to be an effective organizational focus on the host government side.\n\u2022 The CORDS effort succeeded to the extent it did not because of its size (which at times was an encumbrance) but because of its most dedicated and knowledgeable participants. Skilled individuals count much more than numbers.\n\u2022 To be effective, counterinsurgency has to be built by the host government and citizens from the community level up, while simultaneously strongly supported from the top down. This often runs up against overcentralized authority and control.\n\u2022 Attitudes of respect for the civilian population and a genuine devotion to their well-being on the part of indigenous government military and civilian officials at all levels are extremely important. The United States needs to play a strong role in insisting on this approach as part of our assistance.\n\u2022 Most U.S civilian and military advisers involved in counterinsurgency and stability assistance, to be fully effective in the host country, need specialized training, language capability and longer than conventional periods of assignment. Our support is not likely to be successful unless we have some advisers out in the field, despite the security risks involved.\nFinally, intertwined as it is with political progress in enlisting the willing support of the population, counterinsurgency is a long-term process requiring dedication, patience and persistence. After all, we are talking about changing people\u2019s minds.\" American Foreign Service Association official site: http://www.afsa.org/ Affirming forecast."], [29591, "2017-11-12T22:08:55Z", [0.0], "Lowering forecast: NATO are increasing the number of troops for TAA missions:\n\u201cNATO allies and their partner forces have agreed to increase the size of the Resolute Support mission in Afghanistan from 13,000 to 16,000 troops, NATO Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg said.\u201d \n(https://www.defense.gov/News/Article/Article/1369867/nato-officials-discuss-afghan-plus-up-russian-threats/) \nArmy General John Nicholson, Resolute Support mission commander, \u201cTicked off the areas of success, including Helmand Province, where Afghans working with the Marines of Task Force Southwest expanded the secure areas around Lashkar Gah and retook the Nawa district.\u201d\nIn the east, the 205th corps was able to expand the security environment around Tarin Kot.

According to U.N. figures published in July, there was a 43 percent increase in the number of civilian casualties caused by U.S. and Afghan airstrikes in the first half of the year.\" The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, September 30, 'Caught in the crossfire - Civilians are bearing the brunt of conflict in Afghanistan', https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2017-09-30/caught-in-the-crossfire\nClips from TBIJ article:\n\"By the start of 2017 the Taliban was pushing hard to take Sangin city\u2019s district centre, a fortified compound which housed the local security and administrative officials, just a few miles from Hamid Gul\u2019s family home. The compound was the only thing stopping the Taliban from claiming the whole district as their own. The US, which had lost at least 70 of its own troops keeping Sangin out of insurgent hands over the years, scrambled to respond with scores of airstrikes.\nHamid was convinced that his family were still safer behind Taliban lines than in Laskhar Gah, one of the Taliban\u2019s prime targets. But on the morning of February 10 2017, he got an unexpected phone call from a neighbour in Sangin: the family\u2019s house had been flattened.\nIn that one night Hamid Gul lost his 50 year-old mother, Bibi Bakhtawara, six brothers and a sister. All seven children were under 16 years of age. Bibi Rahmania, his niece, also died. She was just two years old.   \nHamid was not the only person given devastating news on that day. On the same night, a few hours later, a second civilian house, just a few miles away from his own, was also hit. The following night a third one was struck.\nTo this day, there is no consensus about what happened to those three houses and why. What is clear, however, is that by the end of those three days in early February five women and 19 children were dead, among a full toll of 26 civilians, a Bureau investigation has established. \nThree local officials interviewed by Bureau reporters on the ground claimed US airstrikes had destroyed the houses and killed their inhabitants. The United Nations (UN) said the same, in its biannual accounting of Afghan civilians killed in the war, released in July 2017, adding that there appeared to have been no fighting in the area at the time, meaning the attacks may have been pre-planned.\nA spokesperson for Resolute Support, the US-led Nato mission in Afghanistan, told the Bureau that after four investigations the organisation could not confirm or deny responsibility for killing the civilians, though he pushed back strongly against the UN\u2019s claims that there was no fighting in the villages at the time. Resolute Support has officially concluded the case as \u201cdisputed\u201d, one of four categories for recording allegations of civilian casualties. It was used in this case because Resolute Support cannot decide if insurgents or the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) were responsible for the casualties, the spokesperson told the Bureau.\nThe fact that no-one has taken responsibility for the deaths of 24 women and children offers an insight into the lack of accountability of America\u2019s longest-running conflict, which it now fights largely from the air under opaque rules of engagement against 20-odd armed groups.\" Affirming forecast."], [368, "2017-09-30T20:34:01Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-09-30T07:22:54Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-09-29T21:35:13Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2017-09-29T18:04:38Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-09-28T20:48:03Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2017-09-28T19:34:27Z", [0.0], ""], [13377, "2017-09-27T22:01:23Z", [0.05], ""], [368, "2017-09-27T21:05:08Z", [0.0], ""], [23234, "2017-09-27T17:03:52Z", [0.01], ""], [30594, "2017-09-27T14:45:39Z", [0.02], ""], [2965, "2017-09-27T13:37:49Z", [0.0], "@Widwood2000  but cf.\nhttps://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/2017/09/27/isis-taliban-claim-attack-on-kabul-airport-hours-after-mattis-makes-surprise-visit/\nhttp://www.armytimes.com/flashpoints/2017/09/06/explosion-at-bagram-airfield-injures-multiple-personnel/ and\nhttps://www.afghanistan-analysts.org/the-new-kabul-green-belt-security-plan-more-security-for-whom/"], [1034, "2017-09-27T04:33:46Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-09-26T21:11:54Z", [0.01], ""], [4273, "2017-09-26T19:02:47Z", [0.05], ""], [368, "2017-09-26T18:02:00Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-09-25T18:38:34Z", [0.01], ""], [23234, "2017-09-25T18:30:58Z", [0.03], ""], [368, "2017-09-25T17:17:20Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-09-25T01:21:22Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2017-09-24T19:10:03Z", [0.0], ""], [10745, "2017-09-24T17:46:37Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-09-24T15:54:46Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-09-23T20:37:07Z", [0.0], ""], [40217, "2017-09-23T18:27:42Z", [0.3], ""], [691, "2017-09-23T13:29:59Z", [0.01], ""], [1034, "2017-09-23T05:40:51Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-09-22T21:01:22Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2017-09-22T20:19:42Z", [0.0], ""], [83, "2017-09-22T17:28:05Z", [0.0], ""], [40094, "2017-09-22T16:29:06Z", [0.0], ""], [40124, "2017-09-22T16:19:11Z", [0.15], ""], [691, "2017-09-22T02:02:18Z", [0.01], ""], [39740, "2017-09-21T21:04:24Z", [0.0], ""], [39835, "2017-09-21T19:51:31Z", [0.0], ""], [39724, "2017-09-21T19:09:16Z", [0.0], ""], [39847, "2017-09-21T18:55:51Z", [1.0], "They try everything"], [39586, "2017-09-21T18:39:40Z", [0.0], ""], [39859, "2017-09-21T18:32:36Z", [0.75], ""], [39792, "2017-09-21T18:28:10Z", [0.09], ""], [39620, "2017-09-21T18:26:29Z", [0.1], ""], [368, "2017-09-21T18:19:56Z", [0.0], ""], [39749, "2017-09-21T18:07:07Z", [0.0], ""], [39715, "2017-09-21T18:04:56Z", [0.0], ""], [39562, "2017-09-21T17:54:49Z", [0.35], ""], [39201, "2017-09-21T17:50:15Z", [0.5], ""], [31450, "2017-09-21T14:21:05Z", [0.0], "Dropping the last few points as the battle for Lashkar Gah seems to be in a stalemate and the marines stationed there aren't going to lose."], [691, "2017-09-20T20:04:02Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2017-09-20T19:52:04Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-09-20T05:10:42Z", [0.0], ""], [755, "2017-09-20T03:06:47Z", [0.02], "Comments: Posted today.

Trofimov (2017) Aug 3, states that: As President Donald Trump\u2019s administration weighs, how to handle Afghanistan\u2019s chronic war, looming large is the question of what is the right lesson of the 2011 U.S. withdrawal from another conflict: Iraq. Was it a strategic failure\u2014or a step that, over the long term and at significant cost, forced the Iraqis to assume responsibility for their own war? And if so, can this experience be replicated in Afghanistan? In 2014, as Islamic State surged to the doorstep of Baghdad and the Iraqi army collapsed, it seemed to many that the American pullout was a catastrophic mistake that enabled international terrorism (para 1-3). Then, quarreling Iraqi political factions came together. The Kurdish regional government in the north ushered in unprecedented security cooperation with Baghdad and the rebuilt Iraqi army. Defeating Islamic State became an Iraqi rather than an American war (para. 7). \u201cThe American withdrawal put Iraqis in front of their own challenges and they realized that they have to resolve these problems on their own,\u201d said Iraqi lawmaker Dhiaa al-Assadi. Mr. Assadi heads a parliamentary bloc of supporters of Moqtada al-Sadr, a populist Shiite cleric whose militias used to fight U.S. troops before 2011 (para.7-8). The answer is, most likely, no. America\u2019s Afghan war, now 16 years long, is different from the Iraqi conflict in many crucial respects. And that is not just because Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, unlike Iraq\u2019s leader six years ago, wants an American military presence to continue for as long as possible (para. 11). While the Iraqi insurgency raged within the country\u2019s Sunni minority, Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban are drawn mostly from the country\u2019s dominant ethnic group, the Pashtuns. And the Taliban keep advancing despite the presence of nearly 9,000 U.S. troops. While U.S. casualties in Afghanistan are relatively rare nowadays, they still occur: On Wednesday, the Pentagon said two U.S. troops died in Kandahar. Unlike oil-rich Iraq, Afghanistan can\u2019t pay for its own military and requires several billion dollars in Western assistance every year. Add to this a political class that is even more corrupt and riven by infighting than the Iraqis in 2014, and it becomes clear that removing the American backstop would likely precipitate a rapid and inevitable collapse of the Afghan state, former and current Western officials say (para. 1-14).

With the Taliban\u2019s annual offensive in full swing, after the opium harvest and the fasting for the holy month of Ramadan, Afghan forces have been engaged with the Taliban in 21 of the country\u2019s 34 provinces, according to the country\u2019s minister of defense, Gen. Tariq Shah Bahrami. The frequency of attacks across several provinces in recent days and the casualty rate among the security forces, particularly the police and government militiamen, have raised alarms. The uptick in violence comes as the Trump administration is considering sending a few thousand more troops, adding to the force of about 8,700 Americans already in the country to bolster the Afghan security forces. In the meantime, the United States military has intensified airstrikes in support of the Afghan forces. In the first six months of 2017, American aircraft released more than 1,600 weapons, according to the United States Central Command, nearly 20 percent more than the number for all of 2016. In Helmand Province alone last week, American forces carried out an average of 10 strikes a day. The fall of both districts to the Taliban on Sunday happened after days of constant combat, with the militants mounting sustained efforts to seize territory, officials said. Kohistan District, in northern Faryab Province, was first to fall, just after midnight on Saturday, after more than a week of fighting. The Taliban overran the district center and the government buildings, said Abdul Karim Yourish, a spokesman for the Faryab police.

Nawa, which is adjacent to the provincial capital of Lashkar Gah, was under Taliban control for nine months before Afghan forces could muster the strength to mount an operation and retake it. The Afghan military, backed by forces from NATO\u2019s Resolute Support mission, launched the operation to seize Nawa on July 15. The spokesman for the governor of Helmand said that the operation was launched from three directions, TOLONews reported. Afghan officials have estimated that at least 38 Taliban fighters were killed during the assault and supporting coalition airstrikes. Yesterday, the Taliban released a statement that noted fighting in Nawa, and claimed to have killed 12 Afghan security personnel, including a local police commander \u2013 but made no mention of loss of control in Nawa. Nawa was overrun by the Taliban in early Oct. 2016, after a suicide bomber detonated an explosive-laden armored vehicle inside the district headquarters and an assault team team took control of the government buildings. One day after it fell to the Taliban, Resolute Support wrongly claimed that the Taliban assault was \u201crepelled\u201d and Nawa was \u201cunder government control.\u201d While Nawa is now under government control, given recent history and the security situation in Helmand, it is likely to become a contested district in short order. Over the past year, the district has been contested at best, as it has exchanged hands four times. Nawa previously fell to the Taliban in early Aug. 2016, but Afghan forces reentered the district center several weeks later. Helmand province has become a stronghold for the Taliban since US forces began withdrawing from the province in 2013. The Taliban now controls six of the province\u2019s 14 districts (Baghran, Dishu, Khanashin, Now Zad, Musa Qala, and Sangin) and contests another six, including the provincial capital (Lashkar Gah, Nahr-i-Sarraj, Kajaki, Nad Ali, Marjah, and Garmsir), according to data compiled by FDD\u2019s Long War Journal. The status of Washir district is uncertain as news reports from the district are scarce. Nearly all of Helmand has been controlled or influenced/contested for well over a year. Al Qaeda has taken advantage of the security situation in Helmand and is known to operate in southern Helmand. Fighters from al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent are reported to have trained at camps located in Helmand\u2019s Dishu and Khanashin districts as recently as 2014. The town of Baramacha in Dishu is a known hub of jihadist activity. The camps are believed to be operational to this day. [See FDD\u2019s Long War Journal report, Al Qaeda operates in southern Helmand province.] The situation in Helmand is so bleak that the Taliban has effectively surrounded the provincial capital of Lashkar Gah, and have launched several forays into the city. The Taliban have also unleashed major attacks in the district. In Oct. 2016, the Taliban ambushed a large convoy of Afghan troops after they negotiated their safe passage from their base on the outskirts of Lashkar Gah. More than 200 Afghan troops were killed, wounded, captured, or surrendered. One month ago, a Taliban suicide bomber killed at least 29 people and wounded scores more after detonating a car bomb outside of the Kabul Bank branch inside the city.\nhttp://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2017/07/afghan-forces-liberate-district-in-central-helmand.php"], [1333, "2017-07-18T19:00:13Z", [0.0], "Marines that were there in 2011 have been sent back to seize control of Helmand."], [368, "2017-07-18T17:01:46Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-07-18T16:10:01Z", [0.02], ""], [4634, "2017-07-18T12:36:45Z", [0.12], ""], [1034, "2017-07-18T05:46:27Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-07-17T19:37:48Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-07-17T19:29:57Z", [0.02], ""], [1034, "2017-07-17T07:08:37Z", [0.0], "Govt forces reclaim Helmand\u2019s Nawa after operation Stanikzai (2017) July 16, states that: KABUL (Pajhwok): Security forces successfully recaptured Nawa district of southern Helmand province on Saturday besides inflicting heavy casualties on rebels, a statement from the Government Media and Information Center (GMIC) said.

Since November 2014, when Abu Bakr al Baghdadi first announced the establishment of \u201cprovinces\u201d around the globe, the Islamic State\u2019s membership grew outside of Iraq and Syria. This further complicates any effort to estimate its overall size. Some of these \u201cprovinces\u201d were nothing more than small terror networks, while others evolved into capable insurgency organizations in their own right. The Libyan branch of the caliphate temporarily controlled the city of Sirte. Although the jihadists were ejected from their Mediterranean abode by the end of 2016, they still have some forces inside the country. Similarly, Wilayah Khorasan (or Khorasan province), which represents the \u201ccaliphate\u201d in Afghanistan and Pakistan, seized upwards of ten districts in Afghanistan as of early 2016, but has since lost ground. More recently, jihadists in the Philippines seized much of Marawi, hoisting the Islamic State\u2019s black banner over the city. Wilayah Sinai controls at least some turf, and is able launch spectacular attacks on security forces. It was responsible for downing a Russian airliner in October 2015. Other \u201cprovinces\u201d exist in East Africa, West Africa, Yemen and elsewhere.\nIn May, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) reported that the so-called caliphate \u201cis seeking to foster interconnectedness among its global branches and networks, align their efforts to ISIS\u2019s strategy, and withstand counter-ISIS efforts.\u201d Gen. John Nicholson, the commander of U.S. Forces-Afghanistan, has said that Wilayah Khorasan went through an \u201capplication process\u201d and the Islamic State mothership provided it with \u201cadvice,\u201d \u201cpublicity,\u201d and \u201csome financial support.\u201d Although it is impossible to judge the extent of the Islamic State\u2019s cohesion, as much of the data is not available, there is at least some connectivity between the group\u2019s leadership and its \u201cprovinces\u201d elsewhere. This is best seen on the media side, as the organization is particularly adept at disseminating messages from around the globe in multiple languages, despite some recent hiccups in this regard.\nWhile their fortunes may rise or fall at any given time, this global network of Islamic State \u201cprovinces\u201d will remain a formidable problem for the foreseeable future. Not only are they capable of killing large numbers of people in the countries they operate in, this structure also makes tracking international terrorist travel more difficult. For instance, counterterrorism officials have tied plots in Europe to operatives in Libya. This indicates that some of the Islamic State\u2019s \u201cexternal plotters,\u201d who are responsible for targeting the West, are not stationed in Iraq and Syria. The U.S.-led air campaign has disrupted the Islamic State\u2019s \u201cexternal operations\u201d capacity by killing a number of jihadists in this wing of the organization.

It is a strategy designed to split the country along ethnic and regional lines. In effect, in turning their insurgencies efforts in other regions, the Taliban intends to divide the state apparatus in forcing the Afghan Government to make decisions on the allocations of security resources. The Afghan military is stretched thin, as it is the reason the US is sending in more troops, and the command and control structure of the country security forces has to make decisions on how to better allocate resources to counter a growing number of threats. This imperative is, as the Taliban hope, going to put pressure on the cohesion of the Afghan Government as certain regions are deemed more vital than other. Naturally, the Afghan officials, especially military leaders, from regions that are going to be neglected will cause problems in a country that notoriously has a patched up western engineered national cohesion.  This need to make strategic choice will therefore benefit the Taliban in several ways. First and self-evident, as the state directs security resources, the Taliban will maneuver.

I assume it means that the Taliban takes control of the inner city for at least a day. I think that the likelihood for the Taliban to permanently hold the city is low, but the possibility for the Taliban to - at least temporarily (e.g. for a day) - capture the inner city is above 0% (see Kunduz 09/2015; Taliban managed to seize and hold the city for two weeks; 500 Taliban against 7,000 Afghan troops). *Thoughts*:\nThe area around Lashkar Gah is heavily contested. According to a Taliban report, the area around Lashkar Gah is largely under their control (could be propaganda but other sources point in the same direction): http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2017/03/afghan-taliban-lists-percent-of-country-under-the-control-of-mujahideen.php Apparently, the local government is continuing to lose ground and Western troops would not be deployed if the situation would be under control (although, I find it hard to locate figures regarding amount of attacks, amount of troops involved in fighting i.e. large scale fighting?, casualties on all sides, etc that would point in one direction). Two informative articles: http://www.bbc.com/news/39586937\nhttps://jamestown.org/program/talibans-spring-offensive-afghanistan-faces-crucial-year/ Google Trends tells me that \"Lashkar Gah\" news coverage is stable (http://google.com/trends). Unfortunately, nothing to deduct if an attack/offensive is imminent. Taliban offensive for 2017 started April 28th. The Taliban strategy combines (i) efforts to overrun the countryside with (ii) a relentless terrorism campaign in the cities. \n\"As its spring offensive evolves, the Taliban is likely to attempt to capture and retain a major population center, likely a provincial capital. Lashkar Gah, the capital of southern Helmand Province, or Kunduz, in the country's north, appear to be prime targets for a Taliban takeover. Key to achieving such a goal would be the acquisition of new weapons, such as an advanced anti-aircraft system, but there are no indications so far that any of its old or new backers are ready to commit such major resources to the group.\" *Initial estimate*:\nAbout 40,000 to 45,000 militants are active across Afghanistan (https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/02/world/asia/afghanistan-security-terrorism-taliban.html?_r=0). Given that the Lashkar Gah area is a Taliban stronghold, I bluntly say that 30,000 militants are in the region. I put Afghan troops at 26,000 in the area (183,000 total Afghan troops divided by 7 corps) + 300 US troops, whereas I assume that 30% of Afghan troops will not fight when the heat is on.  This gives me a ratio of \"militants : Afghan troops\" of 1.6. If my reasoning is correct, the ratio would give the militants (currently) an edge and makes an attack more likely.  Nevertheless - to my knowledge -no large scale fighting has taken place in 2016/YTD'17, which would be required to take the inner city of Lashkar Gah.

I try my best without going too much in an 'inside view' getting lost\u2026\nI say sorry for such a long comment... A) Motivation of Taliban: has two aspects: 'preference' and 'salience' Preference: What is the battle factor of Lashkar Gah for the Taliban?\n- Pro:\n\u25cb Lashkar Gah is the center of Helmand and would be keystone to the retake of the region.\n\u25cb See below the battle factor for the US which contains most likely several valid points for the Taliban, respectively.\n\u25cb --> Yes, there is some preference in the Taliban for this city to be retaken. But is it a salient objective?\n- Con:\n\u25cb I have a colleague who extensively dealt with Islamic terrorist organizations, particularly Al Qaida and ISIS: one must understand that Al Qaida and ISIS separated over a strategic conflict: is it better to keep calm and wait until the US leaves in order to rebuilt a local power base if they are gone (Al Qaida), or should the organization actively try to get them out of the territory and then should try to build up a state with imperial like expansion (ISIS). - Clearly, the latter would let us expect that Lashkar Gah will be a target. We should not forget that ISIS' strategy of taking over cities made their warfare more symmetric than fighting from the underground. And that strategy failed - at least in Mosul and Iraq. The first would lead us to expect that territory gains are not the first objective. Taliban belong to the Al Qaida strand of Islamic terrorism or militia. Taliban might be reasonable to have a strategy of terrorism and of degrading the Afghan political system. \nThis is a very crucial point for the forecast: Will the Taliban really put everything into the retake of Lashkar Gah? (cf. this article on the situation: https://www.timesca.com/index.php/news/26-opinion-head/18059-the-taliban-s-spring-offensive-afghanistan-faces-a-crucial-year) My impression is that this is at least debateable. If their motivation is not strong, a Mosul-like (re-)take of the city is not so likely. It could well be that the motivation of Taliban to (re-)take the city depends on the committment of its defense to fight fiercly\u2026 this would make US and NATO troops a crucial point. B) Capability - has two components: Taliban and the defense: NATO, US, Afghan forces B.1) Starting with Taliban How far away are the Taliban right now from Lashgar Gar?\n- Clearly, they control the territory east, north and south of Lasgahr Gar (see map here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban#Resurgence) What is the pace with which the Taliban gain territory?\n- They seem to gain territory in the summer season when it is possible to fight. 2016 seemed to be a 'good' year for them with a lot of territory gains in only some months (http://features.foreignpolicy.com/first-helmand-then-afghanistan/; http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/operation-medusa-gains-lost-1.4105506 ; https://www.timesca.com/index.php/news/26-opinion-head/18059-the-taliban-s-spring-offensive-afghanistan-faces-a-crucial-year ).\n- According to several articles Helmand is more or less controlled by the Taliban which took them one to one and a half year. But it is problematic to extrapolate from that on a possible retake of Lashgar Gar\u2026 since the game seems to get a little different now\u2026 see below! Is there a probability distribution for the time of the possible retake?\n- Winter is not \"fighting season\" due to the weather conditions (https://www.rferl.org/a/afghanistan-dozens-taliban-militants-killed/28364708.html; https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/05/18/nato-afghanistan-marine-gen-joseph-dunford-says-alliance-should-move-quickly-deploy-forces/101820070/) - although I have seen on the climate diagrams available that the average temp in winter is quite high\u2026 The point probably is that Taliban fighters live in the mountains and cannot easily be deployed\u2026 (???) Is there some evidence that Taliban could at least in principle gain huge momentum? Put differently: what is a good reference group for the Taliban success?\n- Base-Rate-approach: To cases with the largest possible territory gains of terrorist networks and militia like organizations in recent history belong ISIS, Boko Haram, the Taliban, and the retaking efforts of the international coalitions in Iraq.\n\u25cb ISIS and Mosul/Iraq as a success: June 2014 till the end of 2014: expansion of ISIS over Mosul into Syria and to the borders of Turkey; Iraqi army imploded. \n\u25cb ISIS was very successful in Raqqa, Falluja (took only two months) etc. - but they had a very considerable moment of surprise that hit an ill prepared defense.\n\u25cb Boko Haram expanded tremendously in 2014; I do not know how comparable the situation is to the one in Afghanistan today. \n\u00a7 However, Boko Haram had not to face US and NATO trained military; state failure was more severe than in Iraq, and probably, too, had some moment of surprise on its side. \n\u25cb International alliance and Mosul: Is going to be a success, but not within the time horizon debated, here.\n\u25cb International allicance and Raqqa: is not over, at all.\n\u25cb Taliban and Kunduz, 2015, summer to September (short period of retake (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kunduz)\n\u00a7 However, there is the argument that ethnic homogeneity in Lashkar Gah adds to the defense power, there, in contrast to Kunduz (http://features.foreignpolicy.com/first-helmand-then-afghanistan/). So this speaks against Taliban momentum, there. \n\u00a7 On the other hand: Lashkar Gar is mostly populated by Pashtuns: Taliban are Pashtuns, as well; that could make it more likely to gain momentum.\n\u25cb other Taliban: ???\n\u25cb A statistical more powerful case selection / data set would comprise takes/retakes or the attempt to do so in several other occasions in recent history: there could be plenty of cases taken from civil wars, such as taking place in South Sudan right now; or one could have a look on the warlords' warfare in recent history, e.g. Somalia. WE NOT TO THINK ABOUT THIS\u2026 COULD IMPROVE THE FORECAST, HERE!\n\u25cb My educated guess is that the odds for (re-)taking cities of that kind (200000 inh.) is much lower than 50 percent since we would see much more war if it would not. World history led to the evolution of effective defense mechanisms for cities and high costs for invaders - otherwise stable agglomerations of people would not have survived. I know, there are some special 'scope conditions' at work here, so I will take them into account further on. Which resources can be deployed by the Taliban to take Lashkar Gah?\n- Taliban seemingly get weapons from Russia (allegedly to fight ISIS in Afghanistan, but weapons were found in Helmand around Lashkar Gah) (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2017/04/24/russia-is-sending-weapons-to-taliban-top-u-s-general-confirms/?utm_term=.c98ab7c5f061; http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/feb/9/john-nicholson-russian-involvement-afghanistan-bec/)\n- Taliban has external support from Pakistan and a safe haven there.\n- The more ISIS is breaking down, the more resources the Taliban (who belong to the al-Qaida network) have for their fight against US, NATO and Afghan Gov.\n- There seem to be 60000 fighters, and they got more and more despite a hugh death toll; so they are a self-regenerating Hydra (http://www.voanews.com/a/despite-massive-taliban-death-toll-no-drop-in-insurgency/1866009.html) B.2) Let me turn to NATO, US, Afghan forces What is the battle factor of Lashkar Gah and the prevention of a possible Taliban territory gain?\n- First, the city is the keystone of the Helmand region. It is symbolically very important, in terms of power, administration, and the media coverage which is likely to be generated if the city will be retaken. \n- Second, it is a city with 200000 inhabitants, much more 'worth' than the small towns in Helmand: economically, culturally, with regard to 'human capital' etc.. Too, the city is kind of at a crossroads in the country: consequently it seems to have infrastructural - or: strategic - importance. (I have read comments that Lashkar Gah is of limited strategic importance\u2026)\n- Third, the West seems to have invested in Lashkar Gah: credibility and path dependence (sunk costs) is adding much to the battle factor; see @shsmith330 comment: http://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/504712. Besides this, the main objective to stabilize Afghanistan in order to prevent preperations of terrorist attacks on US territory is in danger if there is kind of a 'dam break' here.\n- Fourth, and consequently, the retake by Talibans has some potential to be a signal. And it would be a clearly wrong signal for the West when it had so much trouble with  ISIS in Iraq and Syria and when Boko Harem in Central Africa is likely to cause humanitarian catastrophe. Losing Lahskar Gah to the Taliban is a signal for the Islamistic paramilitary movements around the world that they could possibly have a comeback. And it is a signal that the US may give up all its strategic gains after the 2001 intervention.\n- Fifth, the behavior of the US Admin underlines the 'theoretic' battle factor of the first four points: Trump has clearly bound his credibility on its ability to fight such ISIS- and Taliban-like movements. The US has already send troops to Lahskar Gah in order to signal it is willing contribute to effective defense. See the comment by @acohen: http://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/505588 and by @SneakyPete531: http://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/504737.\n\nWhich resources can be deployed to prevent Lashkar Gah being taken from the Taliban?\n- Could an implosion like in Iraq happen to the Afghan troops in Lashgar Gar?\n\u00a7 pro\n\u25a1 Afghan troops are probably infiltrated by Taliban, and they might have a bad moral\u2026 (http://features.foreignpolicy.com/first-helmand-then-afghanistan/)\n\u25a1 Iraqi army has a much, much greater tradition and much, much more fighting experience than the Afghan military. So the Afghan army seems to more prone to implosion.\n\u00a7 con\n\u00a7 The most considerable reasoning against that is US and NATO involvement\u2026 (see below)\n\u00a7 Supposedly, Lashgar Gar population is pro Afghan Government, not against: as was the Mosul population (http://features.foreignpolicy.com/first-helmand-then-afghanistan/) with the Sunnis (vs. the Shiites)\n- Apart from that, which troops are available in Afghanistan, in general?\n\u25cb NATO, 12000 troops\n     \u00a7 US, 8400 troops\n\t\u25a1 50 percent training of Afghan forces (ANDS)\n\t\u25a1 50 percent counterterrorism (incl. Special Forces)\n\u25cb Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDS), 195000 troops, financed by the West, trained by NATO and US\n\t\u00a7 there is some indication that ANDS is corrupt, infiltrated, has bad morale - at least in the rural areas (http://features.foreignpolicy.com/first-helmand-then-afghanistan/); may be the more professional 'human military capital' is at work in the defense of cities (but, on the other hand, it seemed not to be the case in Iraq and Mosul)\n\t- What might be deployed to Afghanistan?\n\t\t\u25cb from the US\n\t\t\t\u00a7 Gen. Nicholson calls for 3000 to 5000 troops, plus some hundred Special Forces (https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/08/us/politics/donald-trump-afghanistan-troops-taliban-stalemate.html?mwrsm=Email), otherwise: there would be stalemate\n\t\t\t\u00a7 obviously the US administration is seriously thinking about deploying more troops (https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-05-17/trump-has-to-decide-50-000-troops-to-afghanistan) \u2026 no decision has been made, yet!\n\t\t\u25cb from other NATO members\n\t\t\t\u00a7 US tries to lobby other NATO members to send more troops (https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/05/18/nato-afghanistan-marine-gen-joseph-dunford-says-alliance-should-move-quickly-deploy-forces/101820070/) \u2026 no decision has been made, yet!\n\t\t\u25cb functions of possibly deployed units\n\t\t\t\u00a7 training of Afghan units to fight cohesively\n\t\t\t\u00a7 commanding and advising the units deeper in the command chain\n\t\t\t\u00a7 special forces might support fighting tactically\n\t\t\t\u00a7 seems reasonable that this would work (http://features.foreignpolicy.com/first-helmand-then-afghanistan/; https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/29/world/asia/marines-return-to-helmand-province-for-a-job-they-thought-was-done.html?_r=1) \nAll in all: \n- The Taliban are close to Lashgar Gar, they probably have a serious interest in retaking the city although its salience is more limited than ISIS had in taking Mosul.\n- The Taliban have troops, they have weapons, there is summer season, so the danger of a retake is given from the Taliban side. \n- Afghans and the NATO countries, above all the US, are very likely have a huge interest (preference and salience) in preventing a retake of Lashgar Gar in Afghanistan. \n- So it is all nailed down to the question whether the NATO-US-Afghan-complex will have enough troops and will get them into effective operations against Taliban. This could possible signal the Taliban not to go in an all-in strategy like ISIS did in Mosul. Without more troops, I would say the Taliban chances are 1:3 against a successful retake - given that they really want a retake! Given the signals from the Trump administration, they will at least send more troops from US and NATO countries. If they will do so, the likelihood for a retake shrinks dramatically. (More troops itself are a strong signal which could lead to fewer efforts of Taliban to retake the city --- due to deterrence\u2026) I would say it is 1:5 or 1:6 against, may be even less. I start with 1:5 against the retake, 'pricing in' that there are more troops to be deployed: 16 percent. If not, I will adjust my forecast.  If there is indication that the Taliban do not have a strong motivation to retake the city, I think the odds have to be adjusted downwards. After September, October fighting season is over\u2026 so Taliban's chances to retake the city can be hyperbolically discounted after September. Before September a more linear discounting seems adequate\u2026 But, beware of unknown unknown\u2026 and of all the facts and calculus I missed in my perspective.
