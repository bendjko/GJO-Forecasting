Based on Russian ballistic missile submarines, the Sinpo-class carry North Korea to the next level of submarine warfare. The challenge posed by SSBNs is their disruption of an adversary's confidence in detecting and destroying nuclear weapons before they can be used. While the U.S. tracks North Korean submarines, sometimes, as in 2010 when a North Korean submarine sank a South Korean corvette, they slip through the net. The Sinpo appears likely to provide a nuclear ballistic missile capability (SSBN) within 3 to 4 years, but it may be sooner.\nOne final problem? Based on North Korea's recent and rapid improvements in its land-based ballistic missiles, the U.S. cannot take anything for granted. As we saw last week, North Korean ballistic missiles can likely already strike the outskirts of Chicago.\nUltimately, this is just another wake-up call. The threat posed by North Korea is immense and it is growing. In turn, the Trump administration must prepare to strike North Korean ballistic missile development and combat forces.

They're only willing to meet to possibly talk about a peace treaty to formally end the Korean War, but not over the nukes,\" she said.\nImportantly, Terry says the generals in US President Donald Trump's cabinet, National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster and Defense Secretary James Mattis, understand that the military option is not doable.\nShe painted this picture: \"There's over 10,000 artillery pieces, within 60 seconds of Seoul. We have 20 million people living in Seoul. We have 20,000 American expats. We have some 20,500 American soldiers living in Seoul, and they understand (that a military option is not feasible), never mind that North Korea is already a nuclear power.\"\nNegotiations will be difficult too as the North Koreans want a formal peace treaty with the US to finally end the Korean War.\nTerry says that's not possible, either.\n\"...it's impossible to get to a peace treaty option because what the North Koreans really want by formally concluding a peace treaty is really to be able to get ...

The US can block North Korea\u2019s access to cyber-space, and make it clear that the US is behind the attacks. North Korea is fairly advanced in cyber space, and often uses the cyber realm to promote its interests. North Korea is suspected to have been behind numerous high profile attacks, including the Sony hack in 2014 and a recent string of attacks on banks. These attacks serve a range of purposes for the regime, including retaliation against those who have offended North Korea and to steal money. Much of the money from these bank hacks is suspected to have been funneled to the nuclear weapons program.\nNorth Korea has grown increasingly sophisticated and bold in its attacks; however, the kingdom\u2019s cyber-capabilities still lag badly behind the US\u2019. North Korea, for example, lost all access to the internet in the wake of the Sony hack as a result of a cyber-attack. There have been no unrefuted claims regarding who was behind the attack. It may have been the US government or hacker groups. Either way, the success the attackers had underscores the weaknesses in North Korea\u2019s cyber-defenses. By contrast, the US is among the most capable actors.\nThis proposal does carry dangers. Cyber-attacks raise the risk North Korea might escalate its offensive behaviors, and that China may become angered, particularly if the attack inadvertently spills into Chinese systems. These issues can be addressed. North Korea may not be prepared to worsen the situation. In fact, there is speculation North Korea \u201cfreed\u201d Mr. Warmbier in hopes of opening a dialogue. The US must reassure allies it will stand behind them if North Korea escalates, and the US must be prepared to do so as failing to act will further strengthen North Korea. In regards to China, the US should discuss the goals of its operation with China and do as much as it can to ensure North Korea is the only entity meaningfully impacted.\nThere is an additional risk. States have avoided claiming they have used cyber-space to punish another nation. Thus, by acting openly, the US runs the risk of setting a new norm of behavior that would allow other states to use cyber-space for similar reasons. This concern might be a bit overblown. This is a rare circumstance and is in regards to the world\u2019s most infamous actor. Further, the US use of Stuxnet is well known and did not usher in a new age of cyber-warfare. Another targeted use in an extreme circumstance is unlikely to lead to a different outcome.\nThe US could even use cyber-attacks on North Korea to help foster discussion regarding agreements on norms of behavior. Such an outcome would be greatly beneficial. To achieve this, the US must be very clear that it is using cyber-space in this specific case because: 1) a US citizen was murdered by a foreign regime through cruel and inhumane treatment, thus making the release of remaining US citizens highly pressing; 2) the development of ICBM represents a threat to the security of the US and its allies; 3) there are no other tools available to respond; and 4) the US wishes to avoid escalation in the physical realm, and 5) the US does not want to harm North Korea\u2019s citizens. (Cyber-attacks should try to shut down offensive abilities and the connection to the outside world without affecting civil functions.) The US can stress that it is due to these factors that cyber-space is the correct venue for action, and that a broader use of cyber-attacks in other situations would not be acceptable.\nThe US must stress also that it has two main, narrow intents. First, the US must use these actions in cyber-space as a deterrent. The US can harm North Korea economically by damaging North Korea\u2019s ability to launch cyber-attacks on foreign targets. Second, the US should make clear it will only end the attacks once North Korea releases the three remaining US citizens it is holding and returns to fruitful negotiations regarding the nuclear program.\nThere is an additional possible benefit should the use of cyber-tactics lead to the release of US citizens held prisoner and the resumption of negotiations. It will show that offensive actions in cyber-space can lead nations to change policies. It will, of course, only show this works in a limited arena. It is not possible for the US, Russia, China, Israel, or other major cyber-powers to change each other\u2019s policies solely though cyber-actions. A successful outcome in regards to North Korea will instead show powerful nations that there is another way to achieve policy goals outside of sanctions and bloodshed. This is still a problematic outcome, of course, but far superior to the loss of life.\nThere is an additional danger posed by using offensive cyber-weapons against North Korea. North Korea will be able to learn from the code used against it and advance their own capabilities. It appears, for example, that Iran advanced its offensive capabilities after it uncovered Stuxnet. The benefits in this case outweigh the risks, however. Further, once it is known what vulnerabilities the US used to launch its attacks, nations and private entities can create defenses against similar attacks.\" Comments: Getting potential hostages out now.....\nReuters, August 31, 'As U.S. ban on travel to North Korea kicks in, tourists say their farewells': https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missiles-travel-idUSKCN1BB0UH  The Telegraph (UK), August 31, 'Hungry North Korean soldiers 'ordered to steal corn because war is imminent'': http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/08/31/hungry-north-korean-soldiers-ordered-steal-corn-ready-war-kim/ CBS News, August 30, 'Analysis: Pyongyang's view of the North Korea-U.S. crisis': https://www.cbsnews.com/news/analysis-pyongyangs-view-of-the-north-korea-u-s-crisis/\nClip from CBS article:\n\"There are as yet no signs that the population is being mobilized for a military crisis.

Kim Jong-un Weighs Around 300 Pounds\nNumerous media outlets have reported Kim Jong-un\u2019s weight is at nearly 300 pounds. The IBTimes noted that the North Korean leader has gained a \u201ctremendous\u201d amount of weight recently, going from 198 pounds in 2012 to 286 pounds in 2016.\nAccording to The Sun, Kim Jong-un is so big that North Korean officials made a state request to Chinese officials for them to stop calling him \u201cfat.\u201d The comes after reports that some Chinese officials call him \u201cKim Fatty III\u201d in the media and during conversations.\nThe \u201cglorious leader\u201d is said to have a diet that consists of various foods, but his favorites are Swiss cheese and red wine. The Sun also reported that Kim Jong-un has been diagnosed with gout, which comes after his father, Kim Jong-il\u2019s death via heart attack was linked to a high blood pressure and diabetes. 2. Reports Say He Is \u2018So Fat He Has Fractured His Ankles\u2019\nKim Jung-un suffered from health concerns in late 2014 after he was absent from the public for almost a month, missing a number of important events he typically attends.\nThose issues weren\u2019t addressed until July 2016, when North Korean officials spoke out in a rare display of vocalness to set the record straight on Kim Jong-un\u2019s rumored health.\nAuthorities said that he was absent after suffering from an \u201cuncomfortable physical condition,\u201d which is said to be the result of ankle injuries from touring military bases and factories.\nThe officials said that Kim Jong-un has suffered a number of ankle sprains that were then worsened by walking more, leading to fractures. The leader was forced to undergo a number of medical procedures to repair the ankle injuries, and he re-emerged with a noticeable limp and, on some occasions, wielding a cane. 3. Kim Jong-un Stands Around 5-foot-7\nAt 5-foot-2, the height of Kim Jong-un\u2019s father, Kim Jong-il, had often been spoken about. His shorter-than-average height appeared to be such a problem that the former leader wore \u201cheightening shoes\u201d that were captured in photographs. The shoes made him appear that he was actually around 5-foot-6.\nKim Jong-un is taller than his father, standing around 5-foot-7, report say. 4. The Leader Reportedly Struggles to Sleep at Night\nIn addition to disclosing his ankle injuries and weight issues, intelligence officials from South Korea also spoke out about how he struggles to sleep. The intelligence agency said that Kim Jong-un has difficulty getting a full-night\u2019s rest because of fears over his personal safety, \u201cpossibly fearing reprisals for several top-level purges,\u201d The Guardian reported.\nWith the lifestyle he lives, officials warn that he\u2019s also a likely candidate for several diseases.\n\u201cHe keeps a close tab on any potential threats to his power, including the military, and he is obsessed with ensuring his personal safety,\u201d Lee Cheol-woo, a member of South Korea\u2019s ruling party, said to journalists. \u201cBecause of his habitual binge eating and drinking, he is likely to develop adult (lifestyle) diseases.\u201d 5. Kim Jong-Un Is a Reported Cigarette Smoker\nLike his father used to be, Kim Jong-un is reportedly a big smoker.\nA June 2016 article by The Daily Mirror stated that Kim Jong-un spends millions of dollars on tobacco for himself and his advisers. That shouldn\u2019t be incredibly surprising, knowing that North Korea has one of the highest levels of adult male smokers in the entire world (about half of all adult males smoke some form of tobacco).\nKim Jong-un isn\u2019t shy about his smoking, either. He\u2019s been photographed on numerous occasions smoking, including a visit to a children\u2019s camp in Pyongyang.\nOther times he\u2019s been pictured smoking include standing next to a rocket test. His father reportedly gave up smoking cigarettes after orders from a doctor, doing so over 10 years before his death.\nThere were reports that Kim Jong-un had quit smoking after the country launched an anti-smoking campaign, but he\u2019s since been seen with a cigarette in hand on a few occasions.\nComments: Add to all this, I also suspect he's a druggie and sex addict.

Why were the theories so wrong?': http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/08/26/north-korea-nuclear-tests-shock-experts-215533\nClips from Politico article:\n\"A more complete explanation would account for why North Korea was able to weather harsh international pressure from the United States and its partners, while other similarly threatened countries were not. Here, theories that focus on North Korea\u2019s economic orientation and its ability to maintain the support of key allies do a better job.\nAs a hypernationalist regime with a state-managed, closed economy, North Korea had relatively little to lose from international pressure. As an influential 2007 study argued, these types of regimes face low costs from sanctions\u2014since they aren\u2019t economically integrated to begin with\u2014and in fact they may relish a nuclear weapons program as a tool for bolstering nationalist myths. North Korea was particularly immune to unilateral sanctions levied by the United States, as it had virtually no political or economic ties to Washington even before it began pursuing nuclear weapons.\" Comments: Going thermonuclear; makes sense.

Some advanced designs use fast neutrons produced by this second stage to ignite a third fast fission or fusion stage. The fission bomb and fusion fuel are placed near each other in a special radiation-reflecting container called a radiation case that is designed to contain x-rays for as long as possible. The result is greatly increased explosive power when compared to single-stage fission weapons. The device is colloquially referred to as a hydrogen bomb or, an H-bomb, because it employs the fusion of isotopes of hydrogen.\nSource: Wikipedia Affirming forecast (he's got time)."], [21800, "2017-08-26T14:07:32Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.98], ""], [691, "2017-08-26T11:19:53Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [691, "2017-08-25T19:44:13Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [38521, "2017-08-25T17:21:27Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [368, "2017-08-25T16:52:43Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [1034, "2017-08-25T05:17:28Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [38421, "2017-08-25T03:42:50Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [9755, "2017-08-25T02:46:58Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [13959, "2017-08-24T19:14:53Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [368, "2017-08-24T19:05:16Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [13959, "2017-08-24T18:42:52Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [30364, "2017-08-24T13:12:36Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [691, "2017-08-24T11:27:25Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [1034, "2017-08-24T05:49:17Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "North Korea Threatens \u2018Absolute Force\u2019 as U.S., South Hold Military Drills Cheng (2017) Aug 22, states that: North Korea threatened to turn the U.S. into \u201chuge heaps of ashes\u201d and warned that military exercises involving American and South Korean forces this week had worsened the standoff, which could only be resolved by \u201cabsolute force.\u201d In a strongly worded commentary issued through its state media on Tuesday, Pyongyang attacked President Donald Trump, branding his approach to the crisis on the Korean Peninsula \u201cunimaginably reckless.\u201d The remarks came a day after the U.S. and South Korean militaries began annual drills, which the allies say are aimed at defending South Korea in the event of conflict but which Pyongyang says are rehearsals for an invasion.

China or its ally Pakistan likely provided the warhead design, or the warhead itself, to North Korea. Rick Fisher, a Senior Fellow at the International Assessment and Strategy Center said, \u201cIndian sources credit China as the source of the new [Pakistani] ABABEEL warhead multiple reentry vehicle technology and it is indeed plausible Pakistan passed such Chinese-origin technology to North Korea.\u201d According to Fisher, China may also have provided the warhead technology directly to North Korea. He said, \u201cas the Hwasong program started during the rule of Kim Jong Il, it is also possible that Chinese technology was originally given to North Korea which fashioned the new warhead that was tested by Pakistan on ABABEEL.\u201d\nChina also contributed the TEL truck used to transport the missile. TEL stands for transporter-erector-launcher, 6 of which were likely exported by China to North Korea. China and North Korea claimed the truck\u2019s use in North Korea is for timber transport, and therefore not subject to U.N. sanctions on exporting military equipment to North Korea. But experts are skeptical, and cite the truck as key evidence to justify a greater U.S., Japanese and South Korean military buildup, including tactical nuclear weapons useful for destroying North Korean tunnels, in the region. The trucks were first spotted in North Korea in 2011. In 2013, U.N. experts said the truck design exactly matched a Chinese version sold by state-owned China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC), which makes the Shenzhou rocket and missiles. This year North Korea has used another Chinese truck model, made by Sinotruk, to tow a submarine launched intercontinental missile (SLBM).\nThe proximity of the Hwasong-14 launch to Chinese territory is yet another indicator of Chinese involvement. The launch site\u2019s proximity to China would ease the transport of equipment, as well as involvement or monitoring by Chinese officials and engineers. Michael Listner, a space policy expert at Space Law & Policy Solutions said, \u201cthe missile was launched near China\u2019s border and the calculations for the ballistic reentry could have been obtained with help from the PLA.\u201d\nPeter O\u2019Brien, a space and missile consultant, said that \u201cthe real reason to loft [the missile on a high trajectory] - besides trying [to] establish you can use that tactic (so you could use a long-range weapon against a neighbor - the ROK, for example) is to fully test a reentry vehicle (can it take the loads from re-entry?).\u201d Comments: Get some!

As Fanell says, \u201cMake no mistake: The target list for North Korea has been continuously updated during the past 50 years.\u201d\nWe may think Kim Jong Un should be worried by the presence of three carrier strike groups near his shores, but he may not be all that concerned. \u201cLots of firepower can deter only if the intended target feels genuinely threatened by it,\u201d June Teufel Dreyer, a University of Miami political science professor and a leading Asia watcher, told me. \u201cThe U.S. has backed off enough times in the past that Kim probably doesn\u2019t believe that we will use the firepower on him.\u201d\nAnd as Arthur Waldron of the University of Pennsylvania has said many times, Washington has continually taught autocrats to disregard its warnings.\nShould Kim think Trump is bluffing with the Carl Vinson, the Ronald Reagan, and the Nimitz and he proceeds with his launches and detonations, the American president will find himself in an uncomfortable position. As Dreyer points out, \u201cBringing in three carrier groups and not using them sends a bad signal.\u201d\nKim may feel the three strike groups are irrelevant because he can, if the U.S. hits his nuke and missile sites, order the destruction of Seoul, a good part of the rest of South Korea, and Japan in retaliation. As Secretary of Defense James Mattis said a week ago at a Pentagon press briefing, \u201cIf this goes to a military solution, it\u2019s going to be tragic on an unbelievable scale.\u201d\nYet a tragedy of that scale is possible. As retired Adm. Samuel Locklear, once head of U.S. Pacific Command, said in New York last week, \u201cJust because it\u2019s tragic doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t do it.\u201d\nAnd the probability of America using force may just have gone up. South Korean President Moon Jae-in, elected on May 9, made statements during the campaign that sounded inconsistent with the U.S.-South Korea mutual defense treaty. Should Moon carry through on his threats and move his country closer to China and North Korea, Trump could conceivably decide that the lives of South Koreans are not his primary concern. In these circumstances, an attack on the North\u2019s facilities becomes conceivable.\nTrump has often talked about America disarming Kim on its own should China not help, and there now looks to be a deadline for getting the job done. Acting Assistant Secretary of State Susan Thornton told reporters in Beijing on Friday that North Korea is a \u201ctime-limited problem set.\u201d\nIn common English, that means Trump wants a resolution \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d\nSo what is the timeframe the president has in mind?

He also represented China in the six party talks in 2004 and 2005, which resulted in a joint statement that contained guidance for denuclearisation on the peninsula.\nYang says the only difference between the Chinese and US approach to North Korea is the approach to the military option.\nThe Chinese side will not consider military options whereas the US has said \"all options are on the table\".\nBut Yang says a breakthrough occurred after the summit between Trump and Xi in Mar-a-Lago.\n\"So after the summit there were two phone calls and the two presidents finally got common ground,\" he said.\n\"You have heard new voices, new tones, by both sides. Both China and the US are now seeking a peaceful solution.\n\"That is the new element in US policy toward North Korea. Just two days ago even President Trump in person used the word of peace on the peninsular and that is the first time in my more than 20 years appearances on the peninsular affairs.\"\nYang said China's idea for resolving the problem is dual-track negotiations with dual suspensions. This means the US and South Korea suspending joint military exercises and North Korea suspending all nuclear and missile testing.\n\"In practice those suspensions are easy \u2013 it is just a decision,\" he said.\n\"But unfortunately we haven't got any positive responses from both sides although it is not difficult to act.\"\nYang says that if the US and South Korea dropped the military drills it would reduce the strategic suspicions of the North Koreans who could then suspend nuclear and missile testing.\n\"That's the first baby step toward the reduction of strategic suspicions.\n\"Then based on the improved environment and increased confidence we should return to the table to negotiate and bargain all items one-by-one.\"\nYang says China has resisted economic sanctions against North Korea because of possibility of spill-over effects.\n\"We need to be cautious about the spill over,\" he said.\n\"In fact, I always make a joke we cannot learn from the US by shooting one trouble by making more troubles like Libya or Iraq.\n\"We cannot solve a complex nuclear issue only with economic sanctions. Limited sanctions can spill over into human problems and they don't solve the nuclear issue they just put more troubles on the table.\"\nYang says that if here is a successful resolution to the North Korean problem then Xi and Trump can share the praise.\nHe says when Xi met Trump in Mar-a-Lago, Xi \"introduced some history knowledge\" to Trump and the result was a peaceful solution was agreed.\n\"I think the two presidents got a very great consensus about a peaceful solution to this complex issue,\" he said.\" The Independent (UK), May 25, 'The China-Russia summit will focus on North Korea \u2013 but it's really about Western influence in the region - Recent US rhetoric has given Beijing heightened concerns that Washington might now be thinking, much more seriously, about a pre-emptive strike on Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear capabilities': http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/russia-china-north-korea-g7-nato-summits-world-bank-us-influence-a7754876.html\nClips from Independent article:\n\"The rise in US rhetoric is one reason why Wang Li asserted last month that \u201cChina\u2019s priority now is to flash the red light and apply the break to both [the US and North Korean] trains\u201d to avoid a collision. Both Beijing and Moscow are concerned that the tensions on the peninsular could spiral out of control and have supported a UN Security Council initiative that would build on the UN vote last year to tighten some sanctions in response to Pyongyang\u2019s fifth nuclear test.\nThe UN measure favoured by Beijing and Moscow would require the US and South Korea halt military drills and deployment of the controversial Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile system (THAAD) in South Korea. China vehemently opposes THAAD, which it fears could be used for US espionage on its activities, as much as for targeting North Korean missiles.\nRussia shares this concern and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Gennady Gatilov said in April that THAAD is a \u201cdestabilising factor\u201d asserting that it is \u201cin line with the vicious logic of creating a global missile shield\u201d. He also warned that it undermines \u201cthe existing military balance in the region\u201d.\nThe UN initiative favoured by Moscow and Beijing would also put further pressure on North Korea to stop its missile and nuclear testing. It is feared that Pyongyang may be preparing for a new nuclear test, and the regime last month celebrated the 105th anniversary of the birth of its founder with a huge military parade which unveiled what appear to be new inter-continental ballistic missiles.\" Comments: SUSPENSION of annual US/ROK Foal Eagle for same with DPRK nuke/missile development. Good steps to deescalate in the near term without giving up too much [USA] advantage, in my view (would also be good PR with new ROK president). THAAD withdrawal could be thrown in as a further incentive (especially for the PRC). DRAWDOWN of +28k US troops in ROK could be considered, depending on progress.  \nPeace treaty?

The missile would have flown a distant of some 45oo kilometers if launched on a maximum trajectory. It appears to have not only demonstrated an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) that might enable them to reliably strike the US base at Guam, but more importantly, may represent a substantial advance to developing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). Given speculation over the past months about the possibility of military action by the Trump administration to prevent Pyongyang from acquiring such a weapons, the possible testing of ICBM subsystems in this low-key manner may be a North Korean hedge against the possibility of such action.\nWe are still awaiting more details on this test, and if the North Koreans follow their usual practice we can expect photographs soon. But unless Pyongyang is hiding something completely new, there\u2019s only one real candidate for this missile. During last month\u2019s parade, one genuinely new missile was revealed \u2013 one that looks very much like a small, two-stage version of their three-stage KN-08 ICBM prototype, on displayed on a mobile launcher previously used for the \u201cMusudan\u201d intermediate-range ballistic missile.

McNamara spoke about intuition in a 2003 documentary about his role in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. McNamara revealed crucial new details about the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev had smuggled nuclear missiles into Cuba, threatening 90 million Americans. President John F. Kennedy\u2019s first reaction was that he must destroy them with a massive air strike. This would have courted war with the USSR.\nSeeking the widest possible range of advice, Kennedy asked Llewellyn \"Tommy\" Thompson, former US ambassador to the Soviet Union, to supplement his foreign policy team during the crisis. Thompson had come to know Khrushchev well and had stayed at his house in Moscow.\n\"Mr. President, you\u2019re wrong,\" McNamara recalls Thompson saying of the air strike plans. \"I think Khrushchev\u2019s gotten himself in one hell of a fix.\" The former ambassador knew that Khrushchev could be impulsive and later regretful. He imagined a terrified Khrushchev, in awe of the events he had set in motion. Thompson suggested that Kennedy help the Soviet leader find his way out of the crisis. Kennedy decided on a naval blockade rather than an air strike, and Khrushchev backed down.\nThe lesson McNamara drew? Empathize with your enemy, and intuit how the world looks to them. \"We must try to put ourselves in their skin, and look at ourselves through their eyes,\" he said.\"\nHistory tells us that to influence Kim, we must empathize (note: not sympathize) with him.

(In contrast, the U.S. used 503,000 tons of bombs during the entire Pacific Theater of World War Two, according to a 2009 study by the Asia-Pacific Journal.) In a 1984 interview, Air Force Gen. Curtis LeMay, head of the Strategic Air Command during the Korean War, claimed U.S. bombs \"killed off 20 percent of the population\" and \"targeted everything that moved in North Korea.\" These acts, largely ignored by the U.S.' collective memory, have deeply contributed to Pyongyang's contempt for the U.S. and especially its ongoing military presence on the Korean Peninsula.\n\"Most Americans are completely unaware that we destroyed more cities in the North then we did in Japan or Germany during World War II... Every North Korean knows about this, it's drilled into their minds. We never hear about it,\" historian and author Bruce Cumings told Newsweek by email Monday. \nCumings outlined his controversial revision of the U.S.' account of the conflict in 1980's award-winning book \"The Origins of the Korean War,\" which was followed in 1991 by a second volume that also received an international literary prize. He charges the U.S. with the indiscriminate carpet bombing of North Korean cities, which led to significant civilian deaths throughout Washington's effort to cleanse the Korean Peninsula from communist forces sponsored by Cold War foes, the Soviet Union and China. These underreported atrocities, the extent of which have been debated among experts, were formative to North Korean society, in which nearly every aspect of life is influenced by government ideology to some degree, and glossed over in most U.S. history books.\n\"Americans generally, and that includes most of our leaders, don't understand or know much about the Korean War, whereas the North Koreans are laser-focused on everything that's happened since the U.S. occupied South Korea in 1945,\" Cumings told Newsweek. \"That sets up a very dangerous situation, where the two countries are like ships passing in the night, not understanding the other side, and therefore not really knowing the enemy and what they are after.\" Business Insider, May 3, 'Korea expert: There's only one logical conclusion for Trump's 'tough talk' on North Korea': http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-kim-jong-un-north-korea-plan-2017-5?r=UK&IR=T\nClips from BI article:\n\"Raymond, who has kept lifelong connections to the peninsula, offered up a suggestion from his great uncle, a Korean War veteran who was born and raised in the peninsula.\n\"What you need to do ultimately to solve the Korean Peninsula problem in the DPRK is you need to say to the DPRK's leadership: 'All of you guys can have a big sum of money, whatever that is.

Unlike in 1950, when Soviet, Chinese and North Korean planners had a realistic prospect of conquering South Korea in a war, an attack today has only a small chance of victory within a narrow time window. In 1950, DPRK forces enjoyed large initial advantages in numbers, troop quality, and all classes of equipment including tanks and aircraft. Today all of those initial advantages except artillery and numbers are on our side, and even the numbers are more balanced. DPRK planners recognize their inferiority in technology and, after ROK mobilization, even in numbers. They understand that ROK/US forces will have air superiority initially, and (unless China intervenes) air supremacy within days. They therefore plan to win by striking quickly, by surprise, while ROK forces are still mobilizing, US reinforcements are not yet in theatre, and while our airpower is largely committed to overcoming the DPRK integrated air defense system and targeting WMD storage sites, launchers, and command, control, and communications (C3) networks.\nRecognizing that ROK forces will be on some degree of heightened readiness during a crisis, the regime will use its formidable intelligence and special operations capability to obscure preparations for an attack and slow ROK responses. Its own past history of symbolic attacks, placing its forces on alert, and angry promises to destroy its enemies will actually work in its favor in this case: ROK/US intelligence agencies will expect some kind of posturing from the North and may therefore misidentify attack preparations as lesser actions. DPRK agents will also count on the psychological reluctance of the South Korean population and government to believe that war is imminent. They will actively seek to influence the ROK democratic decision-making process to get inside our decision cycle. In particular, ROK mobilization will require a political decision and every hour of delay imposed through threats, deception, information and cyber attacks, or direct action will have consequences. In the end, even if ROK/US commanders do recognize the signs of an attack before it begins, it will still take time to react. In that time, DPRK commanders hope to win.\nThere will be no need for detailed orders. Just as ROK forces know and rehearse their war plan, DPRK forces are largely in place, in numbers sufficient to achieve some local breakthroughs on the major routes towards Seoul\u2014their first operational objective. North Korea will hope to begin mobilization before South Korea does, and thereby turn their currently modest advantage in numbers into a temporarily significant one. DPRK forces will rely, Soviet-style, on the use of overwhelming artillery and rocket fires to break through ROK prepared positions along the DMZ, while using deep fires to attack C3 nodes, routes forward, and mobilization centers. Strikes against targets in Seoul and the surrounding urban areas will have the additional useful effect of causing fear and choking routes with a panicked populace.\nOn the subject of routes it is worth considering the limited space for mechanized maneuver in central Korea: The eastern half of the peninsula is largely mountainous with roads running along valley floors. The grain of the country will tend to push DPRK forces southwest (towards Seoul). The western half of the peninsula around Seoul and the Han River system is slightly flatter, but at least south of the DMZ the land is now so built up that once major routes come under fire it will be slow going for both sides. It\u2019s not good country for heavy forces, and until recently both sides planned to use mostly lighter infantry to fight on the line. Recent announced changes to ROK force structure see a much greater emphasis on heavy forces\u2014perhaps to get more combat power out of a smaller overall force\u2014but the terrain suggests that such forces will likely be difficult to maneuver. Furthermore, DPRK tactics emphasize the use of infiltration to achieve local penetrations and attack deeper, tactical targets. Their line formations include elite sub-elements specially trained for these tasks, and the terrain\u2014whether urban or forested mountain\u2014is ideal for it. Road-bound heavy forces will be especially susceptible to such tactics.\nThe final element in the DPRK plan is an extensive deep battle across the entire South Korean depth using some one hundred thousand special operations forces (SOF). An interesting feature of this war is that since both sides look and speak more or less alike, covert insertion and operation is easier for each side\u2014but especially so for North Korean agents who may move freely within South Korea\u2019s open society.\nSome DPRK SOF will have been pre-positioned. More will be inserted by sea, air, and ground infiltration shortly before the main attack, exploiting\u2014little-green-men-style\u2014any public uncertainty or national command paralysis for temporary deniability. One of the main tasks for DPRK SOF in this preliminary phase will be to support the deception plan by encouraging and magnifying whatever confusion and chaos may accompany a crisis, and especially to foster political uncertainty and indecision in the critical hours before the main attack. Deniable attacks against political leadership, false-flag provocations, staged anti-war protests, terrorist attacks aimed at causing panic, and limited attacks against key C3 nodes will begin in this stage. This phase could last for days or even weeks, but hours are more likely.\nOnce DPRK main forces attack across the DMZ, the remaining DPRK SOF will surge south by sea and air towards targets in Seoul and in depth. Many will be destroyed en route by defending ROK forces, and more will be defeated at their objectives, but DPRK planners hope to overwhelm ROK defenses by sheer numbers of SOF and inflict temporary but serious damage while they still have operational surprise. SOF targets in this phase will be national C3 nodes, including political leadership, mobilization centres, airfields, ports and naval bases, and choke points on major routes. As with artillery strikes, fighting by SOF on objectives in Seoul will be aimed at heightening panic and demoralizing political leadership, and will be exploited by DPRK information warfare agencies to give the impression that the front has already reached the ROK capital.\nWith luck, DPRK planners hope to have main forces entering Seoul within the first week, from which position they can either transition to defense and negotiate from strength or, if conditions permit, push on to decisively defeat ROK forces.\nBut this plan is very optimistic. ROK planners understand it well and are prepared to counter it. Forces defending along the DMZ are in strong, prepared positions supported by obstacles. ROK C3 is hardened and redundant. Rear-area security forces are substantial and their plans are kept current and rehearsed. Even given some disruption by DPRK SOF, mobilization is expected to generate millions of men within days.\" UPI, January 10, 'Kim Jong Un public appearances down in 2016': http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2017/01/10/Kim-Jong-Un-public-appearances-down-in-2016/1941484064957/\nClips from UPI article:\n\"In its annual report on the North Korean leader's public appearances, South Korea's unification ministry revealed Kim engaged in a total of 132 public activities, with most of the activities involving the military or North Korea's industrial sector, News 1 reported Tuesday.\nAccording to the data, about 37 percent of Kim's field guidance were connected to the state-planned economy.

But my educated guess\u2014informed by decades listening to a myriad of clients, including political leaders, gang leaders and organized crime figures\u2014is that Kim was prevented from becoming a complete individual by being born into such a powerful, all-consuming family structure.  And those whose lives are commandeered by the legacies of others and who, therefore, lose the opportunity to express their real emotions and core interests, do have some things in common.\nThey are, first of all, filled with desperation and rage and may project it onto others, in irrational ways. The anger of a child, adolescent, teenager and young adult, whose real persona is \u201cexecuted,\u201d in favor of creating a clone of his dictator father, may know no bounds. \nThat person, in adulthood, may execute thousands of others, as Kim has reportedly done, rather than reflect upon and truly register his own psychological annihilation. And that person\u2019s rage could even become manifest as an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction, coupled with raw hostility toward other nations.\nIt may seem astounding to think that one human being, suffocated psychologically, could threaten the entire world with his internal fury bent 180 degrees and then released from the cauldron of his psyche, but that is Hitler\u2019s story, too.  \nIs Kim Jong Un all bluster? Is the North Korean quest for nuclear arms and the means to deliver them to North America just a ploy to gain more leverage in foreign affairs? \nI wouldn\u2019t bet on that.

While North Korea is expected to carry out another provocative nuclear test on Saturday \u2014 the 105th anniversary of the birth of the regime's founder, Kim Il Sung \u2014 threats and provocations from the Kim regime have become common. But the cooperation seen lately between the world's two greatest powers to contain Kim Jong Un's nuclear ambitions is new. \"Currently, with the cooperation of 'somebody,' the US is planning to collapse our system, the action that is such a naive and foolish delusion,\" a North Korean think tank said, according to NK News. That reference to \"somebody\" appears to be a swipe at China, which recently rejected coal shipments from the Hermit Kingdom, thereby hamstringing the North Korean economy. Additionally, Air China announced on Friday it would suspend its only direct flights to North Korea, according to the South China Morning Post. While China has signed on to every UN resolution against North Korea since 2006, it remains North Korea's biggest economic and political backer. But since US President Donald Trump met with Chinese President Xi Jinping last week and threatened trade retaliation against China should it fail to cooperate on denuclearizing North Korea, the Chinese have signaled a new willingness to act. Trump said at a press conference on Wednesday that he told his Chinese counterpart: \"The way you're gonna make a good trade deal is to help us with North Korea.

This is accomplished by utilizing air assets (manned aircraft, drones, blimps, aerostats) to persistently loiter and record video of a 36 square mile area with enough detail to track individual pedestrians, vehicles or other objects of interest as long as the air asset remains circling above. Automatic object-tracking software called Persistics from the Lawrence Livermore labs allows users to auto-track every moving object within the field of regard (36 sq miles) and generate geolocation chronographs of each individual vehicle and pedestrian's movements, making them searchable via geolocation query.\nAs ARGUS floats overhead for months at a time, it dragnet tracks every moving person and vehicle and chronographs their movements, allowing forensic investigators to rewind the footage and watch the activities of anyone they select within the footage.\nARGUS is only one form of Wide Area Persistent Surveillance. Other WAPS systems are already being used for domestic law enforcement across the USA including Persistent Surveillance in Dayton, Ohio, Vigilant Stare as well as Pixia\u2019s Hiper Stare. While the government has not admitted to deploying ARGUS over the USA, it has shown video in which ARGUS was used within the United States. A variety of privacy advocacy groups including the ACLU and Teame Zazzu have worked to bring the domestic deployments of ARGUS and other WAPS systems into the public debate.\nTraffic cameras, which were meant to help enforce traffic laws at intersections, have also sparked some controversy, due to their use by law enforcement agencies for purposes unrelated to traffic violations. These cameras also work as transit choke-points that allow individuals inside the vehicle to be positively identified and license plate data to be collected and time stamped for cross reference with airborne Wide Area Persistent Surveillance Systems used by police.\nThe mission of the Autonomous Real-time Ground Ubiquitous Surveillance - Imaging System (ARGUS-IS) program is to provide users a flexible and responsive capability to find, track and monitor events and activities of interest on a continuous basis in areas of interest.The overall objective is to increase situational awareness and understanding enabling an ability to find and fix critical events in a large area in enough time to influence events. ARGUS - IS provides military users an \"eyes-on\" persistent wide area surveillance capability to support tactical users in a dynamic battlespace or urban environment.\nA demonstration of the system was made available to the PBS NOVA program and used in a story on UAVs. Gorgon Stare: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorgon_Stare\nGorgon Stare is a video capture technology developed by the United States military. It is a spherical array of nine cameras attached to an aerial drone. The US Air Force calls it \"wide-area surveillance sensor system\".\nThe system is capable of capturing motion imagery of an entire city, which can then be analyzed by people or an artificial intelligence, such as the Mind's Eye project being developed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. This motion imagery is not considered video as it is collected at fewer frames per second than the standard definition of video; TV-like quality of video is 24\u201360 FPS. Gorgon Stare needs to utilize a system of tagging and metadata to be fully effective. The Air Force planned to deliver one system in 2011, another in 2012, and a third in 2014, though they would not enter service until accepted by the commander in the theatre of operations. Gorgon Stare was under development for more than two years and is designed to download 65 different images to a variety of military users for analysis; this is what is referred to as \u201cwide-area persistent surveillance.\u201d\nDuring the Global War on Terror, using unmanned aerial vehicles for persistent surveillance dramatically changed the way the U.S. military pursued fleeting targets. However, their sensors provided very narrow fields of view, referred to by warfighters as looking at the battlefield through a \"soda straw,\" allowing insurgents to disappear from view and not giving information on what was happening in surrounding areas. So in 2009, the U.S. Air Force began development of a wide-area surveillance system to enable the MQ-9 Reaper long-endurance UAV to survey an entire small city from 25,000 ft (7,600 m). Requiring fewer systems to recon a large area frees up more available assets to be able to perform other missions and enables operations to be more limited where a light \"footprint\" is desired.\"\nSource: Wikipedia"], [368, "2017-04-15T21:14:51Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [755, "2017-04-15T17:42:47Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], "Express (UK), April 15, 'SPOTTED: Putin 'moves military forces' to North Korean border as world prepares for WAR - VIDEO has been released allegedly showing a mass military mobilisation in Vladivostok, Russia, just eight miles from the border with North Korea, as the world edges towards war': http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/792225/Russia-Putin-North-Korea-nuclear-Trump\nClip from Express article:\n\"According to the reports, a military convoy of eight surface-to-air missiles, part of Russian Air Defence, were on the move. \nThe S400 anti-aircraft missiles were moved to Vladivostok, where Vladimir Putin already has a major navy base.\" ABC News, April 15, 'A look at the missiles North Korea displayed at parade': http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/missiles-north-korea-displayed-parade-46814519\nClips from ABC article:\n\"INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC MISSILES\nNorth Korea has a history of marking significant dates with shows of military capability, and it was its ICBMs that were most notable on the 105th birth anniversary of Kim Il Sung.\nSeveral KN-08 missiles were rolled out on trucks at the parade. Military analysts say the missiles could one day be capable of hitting targets as far away as the continental United States, although the North has yet to flight test them.\nNorth Korean soldiers also paraded large rockets covered by canisters that were rolled out in two different types of transporter erector launcher trucks, or TELs. An official from South Korea's Defense Ministry couldn't immediately confirm whether any of the rockets represented a new type of ICBM.\nKim Dong-yub, a military official-turned-analyst at Seoul's Institute for Far Eastern Studies, said the canisters and trucks suggest that the North is developing technology to \"cold launch\" ICBMs, ejecting them from the canisters before they ignite. This would allow North Korea to prevent its limited number of ICBM-capable TELs from being damaged during launch and also make the missiles harder to detect after they're fired, he said. \"SOLID-FUEL ROCKETS The parade also featured North Korea's new solid-fuel missiles, which can be fired from land or under the sea. These missiles concern South Korea because they're harder to detect before launch than liquid-fuel missiles, which need to be filled with fuel before launch and also require fuel trucks and other vehicles that could be spotted by satellites.\nSoldiers carried out on trucks North Korea's \"Pukguksong\" missile, which can be fired from a submarine. In a test launch in August last year, the missile flew 500 kilometers (310 miles) after being launched from a submarine and crashed into waters near Japan, prompting Kim Jong Un to declare that North Korea had gained \"perfect nuclear-attack capability.\"\nThe parade also featured the \"Pukguksong-2,\" a land-based variant of the submarine-launched missile. It's called the KN-15 by outside analysts.\nIn a February test launch, the missile flew 500 kilometers (310 miles) before dropping into international waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan. North Korean then fired the missile at a lofted angle for testing purposes. Some analysts say that if the missile were fired at a normal angle, its maximum range could be up to 3,000 kilometers (1,870 miles).\" CNN, April 14, 'Air China suspends flights to Pyongyang': http://money.cnn.com/2017/04/14/news/north-korea-air-china-pyongyang/ Inquirer News, April 14, 'Japan readying for North Korea emergency': http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/889181/japan-readying-for-north-korea-emergency The Guardian (UK), April 12, 'Japanese warships to join US fleet near North Korea as tensions rise': https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/12/japanese-warships-join-us-fleet-north-korea Comments: Pence to be in ROK Sunday, 1st stop in 10-day tour.

Weimorts, Jr. of the Air Force Research Laboratory. At the time of development, it was touted as the most powerful non-nuclear weapon ever designed. The bomb was designed to be delivered by a C-130 Hercules, primarily the MC-130E Combat Talon I or MC-130H Combat Talon II variants.\nFormer US military official Marc Garlasco, who served in the George W. Bush administration, reported that the US never dropped the MOAB in Iraq due to collateral damage concerns.\nThe MOAB has been used once in combat, which was on the 13 April 2017 airstrike against ISIS forces in Afghanistan.\nIn 2007, Russian officials stated about testing of a thermobaric weapon nicknamed the \"Father of All Bombs\"; the weapon is claimed to be four times as powerful as the MOAB. But its existence and specifications are widely disputed.\" Thermobaric weapon\nA thermobaric weapon is a type of explosive that utilizes oxygen from the surrounding air to generate an intense, high-temperature explosion, and in practice the blast wave typically produced by such a weapon is of a significantly longer duration than that produced by a conventional condensed explosive. The fuel-air bomb is one of the most well-known types of thermobaric weapons.\nMost conventional explosives consist of a fuel-oxidizer premix (gunpowder, for example, contains 25% fuel and 75% oxidizer), whereas thermobaric weapons are almost 100% fuel, so thermobaric weapons are significantly more energetic than conventional condensed explosives of equal weight. Their reliance on atmospheric oxygen makes them unsuitable for use underwater, at high altitude, and in adverse weather. They are however, considerably more destructive when used against field fortifications such as foxholes, tunnels, bunkers, and caves\u2014partly due to the sustained blast wave, and partly by consuming the available oxygen inside. Thermobaric weapons have the longest sustained blast wave and most destructive force of any known non-nuclear explosive.\"\nSource: Wikipedia Comments: Good for: 1) caves and reinforced structures like bunkers 2) troop/armor/artillery concentrations  Related:\nGlobal Firepower: North Korea Military Strength\nhttp://www.globalfirepower.com/country-military-strength-detail.asp?country_id=north-korea  \n"], [691, "2017-04-15T01:45:48Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [14777, "2017-04-14T19:52:49Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.05, 0.9], ""], [14830, "2017-04-14T18:18:10Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.05, 0.9], ""], [368, "2017-04-14T17:41:34Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [34449, "2017-04-14T16:42:59Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [34449, "2017-04-14T16:37:17Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [1993, "2017-04-14T06:03:14Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [1993, "2017-04-14T06:03:06Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [1034, "2017-04-14T06:01:19Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [368, "2017-04-14T03:42:09Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [34931, "2017-04-13T14:17:52Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], "Only an accident of poor diplomacy, itchy trigger fingers, or a 'calculated' nK provocation going wrong could trigger this activity.

The missile flew about 60 km (40 miles) from its launch site at Sinpo, a port city on the North's east coast, the South Korea's Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement. Sinpo is home to a North Korean submarine base. The launch comes just a day before the start of a summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping, where talks about adding pressure on the North to drop its arms development will take center stage. \"The launch took place possibly in consideration of the U.S. -China summit, while at the same time it was to check its missile capability,\" a South Korean official told Reuters about the military's initial assessment of the launch. The missile was fired at a high angle and reached an altitude of 189 km (117 miles), the official added. Any launch of objects using ballistic missile technology is a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions. The North has defied the ban, saying it infringes its sovereign rights to self-defense and the pursuit of space exploration (para. 1-6). Park, J. & Kim, J. (2017).

Trump told Reuters in an interview on Thursday that China could solve the national security challenge posed by North Korea \"very easily if they want to\", turning up pressure on Beijing to exert more influence to rein in Pyongyang's increasingly bellicose actions. China has made clear that it opposes North Korea's nuclear and missile programs and has repeatedly called for denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and a return to negotiations between Pyongyang and world powers.\nIt has also insisted it is dedicated to enforcing U.N. sanctions against North Korea. \"We have said many times already that the crux of the North Korean nuclear issue is the problem between the United States and North Korea,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a daily news briefing, responding to Trump's remarks. \"We hope the relevant parties can shoulder their responsibilities, play the role the should, and together with China play a constructive role for peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and for its denuclearization,\" he added. The official Xinhua news agency said China's influence on North Korea had been exaggerated.\n\"The Trump White House needs to make the first move and talk to Pyongyang. The United States stands to lose nothing for trying this,\" it said in an English-language commentary. China announced on Saturday last week it was banning imports of coal from North Korea, after it tested an intermediate-range ballistic missile. North Korean state media issued a rare reproach of China on Thursday saying its main diplomatic backer was \"dancing to the tune\" of the United States for halting its coal imports because of its nuclear and missile programs (para. 1-10).

The KoreanInstitute for National Unification, a state-backed think tank, has tallied up dozens of reported cases of suspected retaliation.\nChina hasn\u2019t confirmed any reprisals but has at times belied a link between its actions and South Korea\u2019s planned deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or Thaad. The two nations\u2019 foreign ministers traded barbs over Thaad this past weekend at a security conference in Munich.\nMeanwhile, China\u2019s official Xinhua news agency, in an English-language commentary, warned the South Korean conglomerate Lotte Group on Sunday that it was \u201cplaying with fire\u201d over its plan to allow Seoul to deploy Thaad on its land.\nThe dispute adds a new wrinkle to Northeast Asia\u2019s complex network of alliances and antipathies as Pyongyang moves closer to its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile that can reach the continental U.S. Last week, it launched another missile test that experts say advanced that goal. The killing last week of North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un\u2019s half brother in a Malaysian airport added to Mr. Kim\u2019s reputation for ruthlessness and unpredictability, sparking new fears in South Korea. Officials in Seoul hold Mr. Kim responsible.\nSeoul recently launched a task force to hear complaints from South Korean businesses operating in China and discuss possible countermeasures to Beijing\u2019s alleged retaliation over Thaad. Some lawmakers have called for a formal complaint at the World Trade Organization.\n\u201cWe will keep raising the issue with the China side resolutely and continuously, while judging facts objectively and responding reasonably,\u201d said Korean Vice Trade Minister Woo Tae-hee recently.\nHow a new South Korean government will respond to China is unclear. Pyongyang\u2019s latest test sparked U.S. and South Korean calls to speed up Thaad deployment, which was embraced by impeached South Korean President Park Geun-hye. The new U.S. defense secretary this month affirmed those plans, as has the acting South Korean president (para. 1-8). Cheng, J. & Jun, K.

From this link (1), discussion of possible mechanisms of change.   The ideal removal/departure would be with support from China but this unlikely, so barring assassination, Kim Jong-un likely to remain in place beyond October 1, 2017. CLIP\n\"Although regime change can be triggered by a variety of factors, it typically comes about in one of three ways. The first is a largely \u201cbottom-up\u201d process, in which popular disaffection and unrest gather momentum and eventually lead to the forced overthrow or voluntary demise of the regime. The second is, in contrast, a \u201ctop-down\u201d process whereby the leadership is assassinated, removed in a coup, departs willingly or dies without an accepted succession arrangement in place, leading to the wholesale removal of the larger political regime. The third pathway is through external pressure, which can take various forms, including the use of military force. Although these three pathways to regime change are conceptually distinct, they can also occur in an interacting and mutually reinforcing fashion.

North Korean succession is hierarchical, but it depends on: (1) acceptance and support by the military; (2) elimination of opposition; (3) charisma and respect of the leader (4) support of the elites. \nAs to acceptance and support of the military, the nuclear program seems to be consistent with the military ambitions. North Korean engineers and population seem to be educated and ingenious enough to carry the program on.\nAs to elimination of opposition, there are no signs that the Supreme Leader is having trouble with it.\nAs to his charisma and respect, Kim-Jon un does NOT have a son. His father has reportedly died of high blood pressure and diabetes. He maintains a very unhealthy lifestyle. An unnamed official responsible for providing supplies for his health has defected with his family in late September. His health might be undermining his personal power. His mental health might be making his actions towards his physical health even more endangering.\nHis wife Ri Sol-Ju has disappeared for 7 months. Speculations are that she might have given birth, have been killed or be recuperating from some illness. Unless he has a son, he has nothing to look forward to except perpetuating his own personal power. BUT, his supporters might become nervous with the perspective of this illness.\nAs to support of the elites, sanctions imposed to North Korea have been difficult to implement. Coal - North Korea major export product - prices have risen and boosted its economic cushion making it even more difficult for the sanctions to make an impact.\nB. The international community has so far approached North Korea policies with sanctions. Sanctions have limited effect. Even if they had full effect, their inconvenience might drive an unstable leader with nothing to lose to simply launch a nuclear attack. This would defeat the purpose of the sanctions.\nThere are other countries that take advantage of the situation in North Korea. Park Geun-hye - South Korean president - has proposed extend its mandate term to better deal with sensitive situations, such as the relationship with North Korea.\nChina is the primary trade partner of North Korea and it views it as a buffer against the Democratic South in its northeastern border. HOWEVER, the nuclear tests have strained this relationship  prompting China to support UN Security Council Resolution 1718. \"Bonnie Glaser of the Center for Strategic and International Studies says the Chinese government has tried to persuade North Korean leaders to revoke the clause that would force Beijing to come to Pyongyang\u2019s defense. Beijing has also said if conflict is initiated by Pyongyang it would not abide by its treaty obligation\" http://www.cfr.org/china/china-north-korea-relationship/p11097. \nInternational contact has not been completely cut off. Leaders have continuously kept contact, even if deemed symbolic (i.e. the Film Festival in Pyongyang)\nC. Whoever wins the US election will have to deal with China and North Korea, maybe as a bundle. Being lenient with an ever-growing nuclear power is bad strategy. But options are scarce and violent.
