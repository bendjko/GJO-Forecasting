In the past 24 hours, Syrian government troops have made major gains to the north of the city. Some reports state that Syrian army units have penetrated, and are holding parts of the city centre. There are also reports suggesting that government troops wish to take the city completely by the end of Ramadan in order to maximise the propaganda value of their victory. Certainly, continuing air strikes and heavy shelling suggest that a significant offensive is under way.  Whether Aleppo will actually fall in the next 24-48 hours (before 1 July) is unclear, however. The rebels' declining military position in northern Syria is such that to lose Aleppo would seriously undermine them, which may make the defence of the city more determined. On the other hand, the rebels probably have more to gain by cutting their losses and pulling out in order to reinforce Idlib, and the more easily-defensible positions in the mountains to the west.  It seems likely that Aleppo will fall soon, and there is good reason to think that Syrian government forces are now in a strong position to push for a quick resolution; however, given the rate of progress so far, it is far from certain that it will fall before 1 July. Worth revisiting and revising this prediction in line with events.

The source nonetheless provides strong evidence of  the **long standing hypothesis ** ( NB/ below) that Aleppo will not be retaken by Syrian government forces b/f 1/7/16. The earlier forecasts have been reconfirmed. With Russians now alleging Turkish support of ISIS, the Iranians now have a free playing field to follow their long term interest in Syria. Pretty ugly scenario for most of the innocent souls being displaced at the present time.  http://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2016/06/11/469909/Russia-Turkey-Syria-Aleppo-Daesh-Maria-Zakharova \"...Russia says Turkey\u2019s military advisers are commanding Daesh terrorists operating around Syria\u2019s northwestern city of Aleppo, which has been the scene of fierce fighting over the past few weeks.\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters on Friday that up to 2,000 militants are taking part in the Aleppo battle based on mass media reports. \u201cJournalists say Turkey\u2019s military advisers are commanding them,\u201d she said...\" /////\nPrevious Rationale\nDated: 24/4/16 Simply coming back w/ my justification : \nAm going down 5% to a 3% probability, well below the GJ average of 15%. A. Hypothesis: Aleppo has & will continue to be a long drawn out process.  Two key points \"retake\"... & the... GJ \"1/7/16\" deadline date ...for resolution of this Q INCREASINGLY tip the weighting scale towards another reduction as \"retaking\" ( with all its definitional issues) a city the size of Aleppo ( presently, no reliable population estimates for Syria's most populous city but, some sources put it still over 1mn people) over the remaining sixty eight days (68), remains a v low probability event. Conclusion:  In the fog of war, source reliability is always an issue. Each side pitching their own agenda. What has become increasingly clear however, is: Assad wants to retake Aleppo & Putin is taking advantage, again, of Coalition acquiescence to secure further political leverage w/ Assad. The circumstantial evidence supporting this includes; a) the so called cease fire & peace talks in Geneva have brought little to no relief; much to the contrary it has given time to allow; b) Assad, in spite of what is left of Syria's economic capacity &, to significantly gear up towards a major effort to \"retake\" Aleppo; c) that Putin, in spite of his official pullout announcement, is still very much \"in the game\" of geopolitical advantage taking by assisting Syrian and rebel backed forces with both heavy military hardware &, air support &, d) al-Nursa according to US Army Col. Steve Warren ( NB below) noted at a recent briefing the US was concerned about the build up of power around Aleppo and, did say \"...it is primarily al-Nursa who HOLDS Aleppo and, al-Nursa is not a party to the cessation of hostilities.http://www.defense.gov/News/News-Transcripts/Transcript-View/Article/739157/department-of-defense-press-briefing-by-col-warren-via-teleconference-from-bagh.  At least two important consequences flow from this combined series of events. First, there is a v high probability, without Coalition direct political intervention at the peace table in Geneva or, on the ground that, Assad w/ Russian support over the next period of time will continue their effort \"hollow out\" the city of Aleppo in the face of the tragic, painful & bloody humanitarian crisis it entails. Second, present US policy of \"supporting talks towards cessation of hostilities\" clearly has a higher probability ( 65%) to give way to continued fierce on the ground to battles in and around Aleppo. As the Geneva talks find no substantive solution, this lack of action, will be translated into further innocent bystander collateral damage & further mayhem of innocent Syrians on the ground as this battle heats up into the next phase. Should, however, the US & Russians, unexpectedly, w/in the next few weeks agree to a \"monitoring systems\" ( 35% chance given present US Administration efforts) this may slow the assault on Aleppo process down somewhat. Note attached NYT point. That said, NB rationale why within the frame of this GJ Q, there is nonetheless a low probability Allepo will be \"retaken\" before resolution date because it will entail an undoubtedly bloody urban warfare from an already stretched Syrian fighting force. Significant advances must be made w/in the time frame of this Q from house to house inside Aleppo. It represents the most difficult phase due to the implications of urban warfare. http://en.abna24.com/service/middle-east-west-asia/archive/2016/04/18/748118/story.html Here is why. B. Rationale for why Aleppo MAY be retaken w/in timeframe of GJP Q: 1. Although officially declaring withdrawal from Syria recently, Russian presence in the Country is clearly on sight w/ support of heavy artillery movements ( helicopters, aircraft, & troops) near Aleppo.https://www.yahoo.com/news/russia-moves-artillery-syria-near-aleppo-stoking-concern-132241690.html; NB: 21/4/16: according to Colonel Steve Warren Operation Inherent Resolve \"...we have seen regime forces, w/ Russian support begin to mass & concentrate combat power\" in Aleppo.http://www.payvand.com/news/16/apr/1100.html\nThe Isreal Arutz Sheva confirm Syrian lead launches/strikes on rebel held neighborhoods of Aleppo. http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/211307 2. 22/4/16: The US cites both concern over the moves http://aa.com.tr/en/world/us-concerned-by-russia-moving-forces-north-of-aleppo/559296\nyet appears to be v careful to avoid direct engagement w/ the Russians.

Additional confirmation of above referenced build up; \nhttp://www.middleeasteye.net/news/russia-building-artillery-around-syrias-aleppo-us-officials-1649771330 C. Rationale for why w/in time frame of GJ Q Aleppo will NOT be retaken: 1. Reiterate \"time of the essence\"issue on this Q w/ resolution date 1/7/16 ...being sixty eight (68) days away. A very short time for such a major offensive to be successful. \"Retaking\" ( w/ all its definitional implications) Aleppo, will require an extremely efficient organized coalition effort for the next two months. The Syrian army according to the following report is exhausted and, in need of support.http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/04/iran-syria-palmyra-nusrah-islamic-state.html# ! It is unclear w/ such an over worked Syrian force, along w/ various questionable Syrian Militia support, whether there will be sufficient & significant manpower in such a short period of time to achieve this objective. Certainly outside powers such as the US have been unwilling to commit ground forces. The Russians have \"officially\"(?) pulled out but, appear willing and able to exert influence over Assad ( NB new cease fire proposal below). \n2. From where do the forces come to retake a city of this size? The US has no real ground force activity. The Syria forces already have their hands full w/ ISIS pushback ( where they have recaptured ten villages south of Aleppo).http://aranews.net/2016/04/isis-captures-ten-villages-syrian-army-forces-southern-aleppo/\n3. 10'000 Al-Nursa militants surround Aleppo, plan to blockage the city https://www.rt.com/news/339244-syria-aleppo-blocked-militaints/ 4. 12/4/16 Al Nursa & FSA militants fought back pro-government force offensive in Al-Eis, a village outside Aleppo. \nhttp://www.globalresearch.ca/moderate-fsa-and-al-qaeda-militants-repel-syria-saa-offensive-in-aleppo-province/5520007\n5. Balanced against this, from a top down NON Mosul & Aleppo perspective, Retired General Ray Odiero put this into perspective, on 13/4/16 wherein he claims around 50'000 troops will be necessary to defeat the ISIS. \nhttp://foreignpolicy.com/2016/04/13/odierno-50000-troops-needed-to-defeat-the-islamic-state/\n6. 19/4/16: Putin & Obama confirm a willingness to strengthen a Syrian cease fire. \nhttp://www.japantoday.com/smartphone/view/world/putin-obama-confirm-willingness-to-strengthen-syria-ceasefire - this point is critical on the issue of potentially limiting Assad from his recent overt/aggressive ventures efforts on \"retaking\" Aleppo for the time being to more clandestine/covert operations which simply slow the process down during such a \"potential cease fire\" arrangement."], [23006, "2016-06-12T00:17:46Z", [0.02], ""], [6303, "2016-06-12T00:15:09Z", [0.01], "According to the general news and GJP consensus, and only 2 weeks to go."], [19368, "2016-06-11T18:19:56Z", [0.04], ""], [368, "2016-06-11T18:04:51Z", [0.0], ""], [15548, "2016-06-11T16:09:55Z", [0.04], ""], [1639, "2016-06-11T14:11:47Z", [0.02], "Regaining control of the city outright would be a major win for the Assad government. It remains relatively secure in the capital Damascus, while the city of Homs -- along with Aleppo one of the cradles of the original 2011 uprising -- was regained from rebel forces in May 2014. Should they be able to take Aleppo, the city of Deraa remains the only truly significant population center in relatively moderate rebel hands. As always in Syria, however, the reality may be rather more messy. Some experts doubt that Assad's government has sufficient forces -- even with Iranian-backed support that includes Hezbollah fighters and Afghan mercenaries -- to take or, more importantly, hold down the city and still have the energy to fight in the rest of the country.\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/us-syria-aleppo-commentary-idUSKCN0XW25N\nAccording to Jane's Information Group, a possible offensive on Homs by both al-Nusra Front and IS working independently might force the government to move critical forces away from Aleppo to defend key supply routes. After additional opposition gains during the 2015 Jisr al-Shughur offensive, Jane's said it was no longer possible for the SAA to properly reinforce Aleppo, leaving their forces vulnerable to any opposition or IS offensive on the city. If opposition forces decided to capitalize on their gains and launch an assault towards Latakia, the prospect of soldiers deserting was raised because if they were not redeployed back to defend it, they could defend their own homes against any potential rebel advance.

Here's the most comprehensible thing I can find on the overall situation: http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-aleppo-idUSKCN0YI12E The upshot of the whole thing: \"Aleppo's northern countryside is the theater of several separate battles between multiple warring sides in the five-year-old conflict, which has drawn in regional and world powers that back different groups. Rebels supplied through Turkey have been fighting Islamic State and separately battling Kurdish forces in other areas. \" Clear as mud, with the whole thing appearing to be a kind of free-for-all.\n\n But there's this, too: http://syriadirect.org/news/new-north-aleppo-route-ends-fuel-crisis-bypasses-azaz-rebels/ Assuming this is true, and I do, it looks like ISIS and the Kurds are cooperating in keeping refined fuel flowing to other rebel militias farther south in the area of Idlib. This makes sense, because there's an economic reason to keep this trade going, no matter what the actual political/religious orientation of the various players, or how they might face off or align in the future. And rebel militias in Idlib are actually fighting the regime. The rebels enclaves in Azaz and Marea do not abut regime-held territory. Here's a map: http://syria.liveuamap.com/ So all of this put together, combined with the regime offensive in the south a couple of weeks ago, makes it seem to me that we're seeing the last gasp (perhaps a protracted last gasp) of the Sunni Arab rebel militias that existed from the beginning of the war. Pretty soon, we'll only have ISIS, the Kurds, and the regime. And right now, those three sides are divvying up whatever they can grab in anticipation of a reckoning some time in the next year or so.

I still don't think the regime will capture the city in the time frame given, but one interesting question is, assuming the regime takes control of the rebel-held areas of Aleppo, what about the Kurdish enclave in the northern part of the city? It's the red area of the map in this article: http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-36169006 Every map I've seen of Aleppo shows an area of Kurdish control, but I never thought anything about it until just now. Even if the regime were to take control of the city by July 1 (which I doubt it can), I don't think the regime would try to take on the Kurds immediately afterward. So even the elimination of rebel-held territory would mean that there was an area of Aleppo that the regime did not control. I think it's entirely possible that Assad and the Kurds might negotiate the handover of the Aleppo enclave for a concession elsewhere. The Kurds have been cooperating with the regime, including during the operation to cut off Aleppo in February, so a Kurdish-Assad deal for control of the city is not unthinkable. But in my opinion the presence of the Kurdish enclave in the city makes a \"Yes\" resolution of this question unlikely even if the regime retakes rest of the city by July 1, which as I say, I doubt they can do anyway.

There's some sort of principle in physics that says that just by watching something, you change what occurs; \"News Distortion\", in my mind, is sort of the forecasting parallel. For example, on this question, once this question was launched I started paying particular attention whenever Aleppo appeared in the news.  It seems to me that Aleppo is in the news a lot lately.  Is that because I'm paying more careful attention?  Or is there really more going on in its vicinity?  Is my perception that there's increased activity DISTORTED by my increased attention??? Then there's questions like the Colombian government-FARC peace agreement, where there's not been much news in recent days.  When there's no news I tend to think \"no news = no progress\".  In this instance, the lack of news has distorted my perception in a negative way about what is occurring.   But that's not necessarily so, is it.  Maybe the lack of news is precisely because they ARE making progress, because they are closing in on a deal and are at a very fragile point in the negotiations, so have agreed to keep a news blackout.   Another example of what I call \"News Distortion\" is the way that the media can be sort of an echo chamber.  A car bomb explodes in Falluja, killing x people, and it is everywhere in the news, reported on from every angle, possibly with differing numbers of victims.  I find it really challenging to sort out the echoes and the updated reports from the original report.   Back to this question:  I am having a hard time discerning if we're really seeing the beginning of a Syrian government offensive against Aleppo, or if its just a mild escalation in hostilities, or even just what I call \"News Distortion\" because I'm paying more attention and the media's got echo turned up full volume.    That said, I've been reading for a while that it appears that the ceasefire is breaking down, so maybe I should increase my forecast.  I don't know if this is a harbinger of a big offensive to come, or not, so I'm thinking that my forecast increase shouldn't be extreme, especially since this question has a relatively near-term end date and requires not just the launching of an offensive, but the RETAKING of Aleppo.  I sure wish I had bought one of those crystal balls when they were on sale at Walmart!   Dang!  Since I didn't, I'll go with the crowd's forecast. . . .

Conclusion:   In the fog of war, source reliability is always an issue. Each side pitching their own agenda. What has become increasingly clear however, is: Assad wants to retake Aleppo & Putin is taking advantage, again, of Coalition acquiescence to secure further political leverage w/ Assad. The circumstantial evidence supporting this includes;  a) the so called cease fire & peace talks in Geneva have brought little to no relief; much to the contrary it has given time to allow; b) Assad, in spite of what is left of Syria's economic capacity &, to significantly gear up towards a major effort to \"retake\" Aleppo;  c) that Putin, in spite of his official pullout announcement, is still very much \"in the game\" of geopolitical advantage taking by assisting Syrian and rebel backed forces  with both heavy military hardware &, air support &, d) al-Nursa according to US Army Col. Steve Warren ( NB below) noted at a recent briefing the US was concerned about the build up of power around Aleppo and, did say \"...it is primarily al-Nursa who HOLDS Aleppo and, al-Nursa is not a party to the cessation of hostilities.http://www.defense.gov/News/News-Transcripts/Transcript-View/Article/739157/department-of-defense-press-briefing-by-col-warren-via-teleconference-from-bagh.   At least two important consequences flow from this combined series of events. First, there is a v high probability, without Coalition direct political intervention at the peace table in Geneva or, on the ground that,  Assad w/ Russian support over the next period of time will continue their effort \"hollow out\" the city of Aleppo in the face of the tragic, painful & bloody humanitarian crisis it entails. Second, present US policy of \"supporting talks towards cessation of hostilities\" clearly has a higher probability ( 65%) to  give way to continued fierce  on the ground to battles in and around Aleppo. As the Geneva talks find no substantive solution, this lack of action, will be translated into further innocent bystander collateral damage & further mayhem of innocent Syrians on the ground as this battle heats up into the next phase. Should, however, the US & Russians, unexpectedly,  w/in the next few weeks agree to a \"monitoring systems\" ( 35% chance given present US Administration efforts) this may slow the assault on Aleppo process down somewhat.

Russian Government ( see below) is now back into the effort w/ air support. Conclusion: Balancing the above referenced  blitz of war oriented public disclosures from sources pushing their particular vested interest, leaves me still cautious on raising my v low forecast. Why? Mosul, Iraq comes to mind. There, at the start of the campaign outsiders were subjected to a similar blitz of reports the effort to retake Mosul had begun only to find a month or two later, it will be a long haul. In Aleppo, Syrian forces look more organized than the Iraqis in Mosul. The jury is still out in both locations. The difference here being We have a deadline date approaching to a complex and varied set of geopolitical interests. Under these circumstances, I'm choosing to move slowly considering these various problems. It is still v unclear to me  whether Aleppo can be retaken w/in the deadline date of this GJ Q. Here is why: Facts:  There are 90 days left to 1/7/16 GJ deadline on Syrian forces \"retaking\" Aleppo.  Thus, definitional issues on retaking come to mind when time -is of the essence - as it as in this case. \nArgument: \nWhat is clear on the one hand,  are facts/reliable reports on the ground, making clear a concerted effort by the Nursa Front ( Syria's equivalent of al-Qarda) to push back Syrian forces in Aleppo's southern region.http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/nusra-aleppo-ceasefire-1772863533http://aranews.net/2016/04/syrian-islamist-rebels-capture-two-key-towns-south-aleppo/ will remain in force.

Continued violations of an ongoing \u2018cessation of hostilities\u2019 by both pro-regime and opposition factions have fueled the largest outbreak of violence in northern Syria since the agreement went into effect on February 27, threatening to drive a wider breakdown of the tenuous ceasefire. Additional violence can also be expected in northern Aleppo Province over the coming weeks as Turkey and the U.S. vie over the course and composition of coalition-led efforts to sever the ground lines of communication between Ar-Raqqa City and the Syrian-Turkish Border. Turkey has worked to empower opposition groups in Aleppo Province in order to foil the territorial gains made by the Syrian Kurdish YPG, which the U.S. relies upon in the counter-ISIS fight. The regime and its allies also retain positions at the Kuweires Airbase from which to contest ISIS-held portions of Aleppo Province. This local competition for control over Aleppo Province \u2013 and the larger geopolitical struggle between the U.S., Russia, Iran, and Turkey that it reflects \u2013 will reach a critical boiling point in the coming months. 1. Hostilities Resume in Southern Aleppo Province: Syrian Al-Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra and a coalition of other opposition groups \u2013 including several U.S.-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA)-affiliated factions \u2013 seized the strategic town of Al-Eis in southern Aleppo Province on April 1 following clashes that involved at least three SVBIED detonations. The Syrian Arab Army released a statement condemning the offensive as a major violation of the \u2018cessation of hostilities\u2019 and vowing to recapture the town, while opposition groups presented the attack as a justified counterattack in response to persistent ceasefire violations by pro-regime forces throughout the country. Pro-regime forces have mobilized for a counteroffensive amidst reports that Russia resumed its air campaign in Aleppo Province. Iran also announced the deployment of \u2018advisors\u2019 from its conventional armed forces in a significant inflection of its own intervention in Syria. The mounting military escalation in southern Aleppo Province heightened further on April 5 after prominent Salafi-Jihadist group Ahrar al-Sham downed a regime warplane over Al-Eis. The incident comes amidst persistent rumors that Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and other foreign actors may intend to provide the opposition with a small number of man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS) as a counter the air campaign being conducted by Russia in Syria. 2. Kurds and Opposition Skirmish in Aleppo City: The Syrian Democratic Forces \u2013 a coalition composed of the Syrian Kurdish YPG and allied opposition factions \u2013 clashed with Syrian Al-Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra and other opposition groups in the Sheikh Maqsoud District of Aleppo City on April 5. Activist groups accused the Syrian Democratic Forces of cooperating with the regime in order to sever the key Castello Highway that supplies opposition-held Aleppo City. Long-standing tensions with the Syrian Kurds have flared into open violence in the past few months after the Syrian Democratic Forces assisted the regime in severing the primary ground line of communication between Aleppo City and Turkey in February 2016. 3. Turkish-Backed Opposition Advances on Syrian-Turkish Border: The Hawar Kilis Operations Room \u2013 a coalition of opposition groups backed by the U.S. and Turkey \u2013 seized the ISIS-held town of Al-Rai in northern Aleppo Province on April 7. Al-Rai serves as a key route for illegal cross-border smuggling of foreign fighters and supplies to ISIS in Syria. The advance comes as part of an ongoing offensive along the Syrian \u2013 Turkish Border that seized at least sixteen villages from ISIS since March 31. Turkey has intensified its provision of weapons, cross-border artillery fire, and other forms of support to opposition forces in northern Aleppo Province in recent months in a likely attempt to preclude further gains in the border region by the Syrian Kurdish YPG. 4. The U.S. and Turkey Spar Over Counter-ISIS Operations: The Syrian Democratic Forces \u2013 a coalition composed of the Syrian Kurdish YPG and allied opposition factions \u2013 announced preparations for an upcoming military operation to seize the ISIS-held city of Manbij in eastern Aleppo Province. Manbij is a major hub for foreign fighters and supplies transiting the Syrian-Turkish Border, thus representing a key objective for the U.S.-led coalition in its efforts to isolate Ar-Raqqa City. The operation nonetheless faces significant hurdles. Local Arab and Turkmen tribes have reportedly resisted overtures to participate in the operation due to the alleged mistreatment of civilians in regions previously-cleared by the Syrian Kurdish YPG. Meanwhile, Turkish President Recep Erdogan reportedly linked his support for the operation to demands for participating Sunni Arab factions to disavow their ties with the Syrian Democratic Forces as well as calls for the U.S. to provide additional air support to Turkish-backed opposition groups in northern Aleppo Province. The U.S. and Turkey held a technical meeting on April 4 in order to discuss the operation but the issue remains contentious given the links between the Syrian Kurdish YPG and the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), a designated terrorist group currently waging an active insurgency in southern Turkey."], [20031, "2016-04-08T01:20:12Z", [0.36], "Increasing from 24 to 36.\nRussian media is reporting that Jaysh al-Islam is using chemical weapons against civilians in Aleppo, and that there have been numerous ceasefire violations in Aleppo.

I think there is a 27% chance of this happening, because: The Syrian Army has the backing of Hezbollah, Iraqi Shiite militias, and the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which give needed manpower to a military quite depleted after almost five years of civil war. The number of fighters contributed by these groups is quite small, but demonstrates the willingness of foreign powers to support the Assad regime. If more success by the Syrian government seems likely, they may be willing to give greater assistance to Assad. However, that assistance is a small contributing factor to retaking Aleppo. +2% Russian military intervention is the linchpin for the Syrian Army's success so far in advancing on Aleppo. That support is not disappearing, despite media reports: http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/03/30/putins-attack-helicopters-and-mercenaries-are-winning-the-war-for-assad/ +15% The US and NATO allies do not plan to change their course of action in Syria. This makes the likelihood of moderate rebel groups receiving enough support to reverse their recent misfortune extremely unlikely. +5% Kurdish fighters are neutral to the Assad regime and have the support of the US because they are the most effective fighters against ISIS/Daesh. Given the likelihood they will secure routes north of Aleppo and cut off supplies to moderate rebels in the city, chances of continued assistance through these routes to rebels is slim. Because the Kurds are backed by the US, they are relatively free from Turkish ire, their main opponents in the region after ISIS/Daesh. With continued Kurdish success almost guaranteed and their neutral alignment with the regime, the position of rebels in Aleppo only grows more precarious. +5% However, sieges tend to be long, and the siege of Aleppo has not even truly begun yet. The regime has not yet encircled the city or cut off all supply lines to it. Given the length of most sieges is much longer than 3 months, it is strongly unlikely Syrian government forces will retake Aleppo before July 1, 2016. Also, recent ceasefire success suggests the Syrian Army will use a halt in violence around Aleppo to strengthen its position elsewhere. Because the ceasefire frees up the regime to commit troops to other fronts, the Syrian Army has an interest in prolonging the ceasefire until the advantages of attacking Aleppo outweigh the disadvantages. Because of the dwindling chance of resupplying Aleppo, a ceasefire also turns the battle into a war of attrition that the rebels will lose eventually. Finally, Assad rejects opposition demands, decreasing the likelihood of rebels disarming peacefully before July 1: http://www.cbsnews.com/news/syria-bashar-assad-rejects-transitional-body-opposition-geneva-peace-talks/ Without a full siege underway and a low chance of a diplomatic resolution to end the fighting completely, the chance of Syrian government forces to retake the city of Aleppo is unlikely: 27% ***** UPDATE: Upped to 35% due to news: http://www.syriadeeply.org/articles/2016/04/10312/syria-deeply-executive-summary-april-11/"], [23385, "2016-04-02T06:54:48Z", [0.08], ""], [755, "2016-04-02T05:34:35Z", [0.55], "Affirming forecast for the passage of time."], [23380, "2016-04-02T00:12:18Z", [0.0], ""], [19930, "2016-04-01T21:09:12Z", [0.04], ""], [368, "2016-04-01T20:42:39Z", [0.0], ""], [23374, "2016-04-01T20:40:24Z", [0.35], ""], [8605, "2016-04-01T18:55:52Z", [0.9], "IS has lost momentum when Turkey are under pressure from the rest of THE  WORLD!!!

It also depends on which IS fighters are involved, it could be that in Mosul most \"IS\" fighters are really ex-Baathists who will not want to leave Iraq to support IS in Syria. \nThe Syrian gov (and Russians) seems to have switched to fighting IS.

With IS having lost 22% of their territory in the Caliphate, it now is concentrated in eastern Syria and western Iraq.   This however does not imply a absence from other strategic areas it holds.  Since IS is stepped in it's religious doctrine of prophesies of the 'end days' in the region of the Middle East, it holds an imperative (religiously) to maintain control and expansion in this part of the world.   Must like the Crusades and the Ottoman's, it is sincerely committed to the extermination and eradication of religious traditions other than its own.   However one can postulate that as degree of territorial control by IS in Syria/Iraq, we can expect increased spectacular acts of terror (that it envisions against the counter-terror forces in its military campaigns in Syria/Iraq.  Consequently, counter-terror activity in the West should increase its deterrent and proactive activity in anticipation of what is to come.   While the most recent campaigns of political violence in Dec, Jan, & February (2015-2016) might appear as disparate, the IS continues to emphasize in its recruitment and training programs (including the lone wolf activity in western countries as well as eastern states who oppose its advance, ie., South East Asia [Indonesia, Philippines, etc.]) that its focus should continue at the transnational (or international level) while simultaneously holding the current territories.   Without territory to create a state (Caliphate), the IS project will be viewed by its actors as a failed project, thereby increasing the potential for exponential factionalism and spurning of more radicalized actors with greater determination to reach its objectives.

That said, the gap left by the price of oil today relative to their ongoing budget requirements leaves Russia still close to dire economic straights.

Assad may be in a strong position now, but we must keep his current force strength in perspective- his army is battered and weakened after 5 years of civil war, and even with Russian, Iranian and Hezbollah backup, the costs the rebels in Aleppo could impose on Assad's forces could easily make the battle prohibitive for Assad.

First, there's the matter of whether the ceasefire will be extended, and how many times. I think it's possible that in two weeks, it will be extended for another two weeks, then two after that, etc. I think the regime would be willing to go for this, for reasons I explain below. One problem the regime has in undertaking continuing operations in Aleppo is the vulnerability of the \"dog leg\" road linking the bulk of regime-held territory with Aleppo. This road has been cut twice in the past six months (although it was reopened by the regime), and ISIS holds the high ground overlooking the town of Khanaser, which is one of the few towns on the route. This vulnerability makes continued offensive action in Aleppo itself more difficult. In the most recent offensive to cut off Aleppo, some regime forces appear to have struck from Kurdish-held territory, but a direct land link between regime areas and Kurdish areas is even more tenuous than the dog leg road through the eastern steppe/desert. So another major effort in Aleppo may not be practical. I think over the next few months what the regime will focus on one of two things: shrinking al-Nusra's territory in Idlib province, or moving against ISIS to expand the area to secure its existing route to Aleppo.  Al-Nusra is fair game even under the ceasefire, and the next logical step after the relief of Idlib city is a push on to Aleppo to open a direct route from Latakia to Aleppo and effectively unite all regime-held territory into a solid bloc in the west. ISIS is also fair game, but driving ISIS troops from the hills around Khanaser will probably be as costly as an offensive in Idlib, and less strategically valuable overall. So my guess is that an offensive to open the route to Idlib is more likely than another major effort in Aleppo. So for the moment, the regime has an interest in the extension of the ceasefire because it offers an opportunity to shift resources to attacks on al-Nusra and ISIS, both of whom can be attacked without violating the ceasefire. If the regime does undertake the type of operation I'm guessing it will, and succeeds in relieving Idlib city and defeating al-Nusra, the regime will almost certainly wind up in control of Aleppo.
