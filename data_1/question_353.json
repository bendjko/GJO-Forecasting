I recall having read enthusiastic press from SK on BKM before his retirement; there is not much now.  A few points against his presidential bid\n1. Ban was initially courted by President Park and the pro-Park faction of the party but Ban is clever enough to distance himself from her after the scandal.\n2. However, Ban faces several ethical and political issues as a presidential candidate, especially under the current political uncertainty surrounding Park\u2019s impeachment and divisive party politics.\n3. Ban is already alleged to have received $230,000 from a businessman that bribed late President Roh. Ban\u2019s brother and nephew have also been accused of bribery. Ban denies all the allegations.\n4.  Being a lifetime bureaucrat, Ban has no political base in Korea. Instead, he has a history of avoiding tricky situations and political rivalry.  UN RESOLUTION:\nThere is an ethical issue surrounding his candidacy as an immediately retired UNSG. Article 4(b) of the UN General Assembly Resolution 11(1) on Terms of the Appointment of the Secretary-General in 1946 states that \u201c[b]ecause a secretary-general is a [confidant] of many governments, it is desirable that no Member should offer him, at any rate immediately on retirement, any governmental position in which his confidential information might be a source of embarrassment to other Members, and on his part a secretary-general should refrain from accepting any such position.\u201d For this reason, Kurt Waldheim and Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar (two previous SGs) waited four to five years after their retirements from UNSG to run for the Austrian and Peruvian presidencies, respectively.\n________________________\nCOMMENTS:  I knew that Ban Ki-moon had a lackluster term at the UN; in fact, Ban\u2019s retirement met with his own staff\u2019s censure and no tears were shed, according to the UN staff unions. To many, his legacy will be as the worst UNSG, who was more interested in being a president than being a charismatic and visible UNSG.\nThe UN Resolution (above) is only a recommendation and therefore not legally binding. The timing though may create a bit of a problem, if not a legal one.\nThe question here however, is if he announces his candidacy, not if he will be the next president.

Korean press is all but sure Ban will run; not sure if because that's how press works everywhere (sells more papers), or because they have cultural context that I lack. One story reported that Ban had \"all but declared his run\" simply by saying he would give Korea \"his all\" when he returned. Where I come from that's far from announcing a presidential run, but I'm not from SK. One thing I found telling, but American press gave short shrift to, is the fact that Ban was accompanied by famous development economist Jeffrey Sachs in a recent press conference at Ban's residence [1], who declared he would \"advise Ban, especially in regards to Korea's ailing economy\". Unfortunately this signal is muddled by the reporting. Some stories claims Sachs said he would \"support Ban in his presidential run\" (strong signal), others claim only that Sachs said \"he'd help Ban in any way he can\" IN RESPONSE to a question of whether he would help Ban in the future (weak signal). I thought I could find his exact words if I dug into the original Korean articles but I could not. Anyway, of all the political jobs Ban could hold (and I think he clearly wants one), not many have economic \"advisors\". Of the SK ministries I could see that being a thing for Strategy & Finance; Trade, Industry & Energy; and Employment & Labor. I can't see Ban holding the latter two (Ban is not a technical person), but Strategy & Finance is also by law the Prime Minister (which is picked by the President). However I don't think that, during a presidential campaign in SK, candidates announce who their PM will be. (E.g. Google turns up no news in 2012 containing \"Park Geun-hye\" and \"Chung Hong-won\" (her first PM).)  If they don't, it would seem pointless for Ban to advertise the support of Sachs unless he really was thinking of running for prez. Moreover, looking over the list of SK prime ministers [2] it looks like a given president goes through many prime ministers, so prez/PM are much less tightly coupled than prez/VP in other countries -- another indication that PMs are not a factor during campaign. On the other hand, Sachs is a close personal friend of Ban's, has served as his special advisor at the UN for years, and also lives in NYC, so going to that press conference might be a low-effort thing for him and consequently not such a strong signal. But I can't find e.g. any news of Kofi Annan holding any press conferences accompanied by any economists in 2006, his last year as sec-gen. (Before Annan was Boutros-Ghali from Egypt, who arguably could not run due to Mubarak. Before that, internet news is scarce.) In any case, here's my Bayesian update. My previous P[Ban runs] was 0.25. Let's say P[Ban wants to run] (note that it's a different probability) is 0.5. I have also the following guesses: P[Ban shows off Sachs | Ban wants to run] -- between 0.85 and 0.95\nP[Ban shows off Sachs | Ban does not want to run] -- between 0.1 and 0.3 Hence P[Ban wants to run | Ban shows off Sachs]\n= P[Ban shows off Sachs | Ban wants to run] * P[Ban wants to run] / P[Ban shows off Sachs]\n= 0.9*0.5/(0.5*0.9 + 0.5*0.2) ~ 0.82. However wanting to run is different than running. There may be obstacles. However the conservative party in SK recently fell apart and I have heard absolutely no names for a conservative leader thrown around, except Ban's. So let's say P[Ban runs | Ban wants to run] is high, 0.9. That would make P[Ban runs] ~ 0.74.

I read all the articles and read between all the lines. The consensus is quite high (65% as a write), and one of my flaws is too much eagerness to beat the consensus, so I kind of wanted to put this at 75% or 80%. But the base rates do not hold this up, and I found myself having to come in substantially below consensus. Anyway, on to the forecast. Info below is extracted from Wikipedia [1,2,3,4,5,6] and I won't cite at every turn. REASONS BAN WOULD RUN\n* Running for president in SK has a much lower entry barrier than in the US. Every election has at least half a dozen candidates, and recently as many as 10. Every time, all but 2 or 3 get under 0.5% of the vote, so I'm not really sure why they're running, but there you go.\n* Ban's entire life has been in politics, including high levels of SK politics (Minister of Foreign Affairs) and the highest levels of international politics.\n* When asked if he would run, he has not denied it.\n* He is polling very well at the moment, and in 2012 opinion polling correctly predicted the winner 11 months before the election [1]. REASONS BAN WOULD NOT RUN\n* He is old; ten years older than the average age of the last 6 presidents upon inauguration. (The president preceding those was not chosen by direct election so I exclude him from analysis.) Ban is approximately as old as the very oldest SK president ever inaugurated, and a lot older than all the others.\n* He has already had an extremely distinguished career. Doesn't have much left to prove.\n* The date of the election is quoted as Dec 2017, but in fact it is quite possible it will happen as early as August. The rule is, if the Constitutional Court upholds the impeachment of Park, which they have less than 6 months to decide on, the election must take place 60 days later [7]. The public is very against Park, so we (and Ban) must assume a fair/good chance of August elections. This tightens the timeframe, and yet Ban has not announced his run.\n* There are many other ways for him to influence SK politics if that is what he wants to do. BASE RATES\n* Ban's only experience in SK politics is as Minister of Foreign Affairs, and precisely ZERO previous Ministers of Foreign Affairs have ever run for president [9]. This base rate includes a minister who was president of the 56th UN General Assembly and prime minister of SK, and another who was also Minister of Unification in addition to Foreign Affairs.\n* Of the 8 secretary-generals the UN has had, only 2 have run for the highest elected office of their home countries. But one of those was Egyptian, and arguably nobody could run in Egypt under Mubarak. So let's call this base rate 2/7 = 29%. GUESSES\nPeople keep talking about the Saenuri party cleaning house, earning back public trust, etc, but the rule in SK is for parties to be constantly dissolving, merging, and changing names. It's an easy way to wash out sins. I think there's a better than even chance that Saenuri will dissolve, and most of its members will form a new conservative party, taking care to exclude people too close to Park. My guess is that Ban would join this new party. I don't think he will run as independent; independents simply do not win in SK. In fact they get <1% of the vote. The only seeming exception, Lee Hoi-chang in 2007, was actually a long-time member of the major conservative party --- then called Grand National Party, later renamed Saenuri --- and was their presidential candidate in 2002 and 1997. FORECAST\nAveraging the two base rates we get 15%. Add on 10% for not denying he will run, and general uncertainty because a fair amount of time is left. So 25%.

OTOH, the collapse of the pro-US Saenuri Party, may motivate Ban to run to prevent a leftward shift in SK strategic alignment. Seems that Park can hold out long enough to allow Ban to run, if he chooses to.  Presidential elections are due on Dec. 20, 2017.   Earlier elections may be held if Park  is removed, or resigns, before the end of her term. If Park is removed from the Presidency by impeachment or resignation, new elections must be held within 60 days.  Currently a senate vote to start impeachment is scheduled for Friday Dec. 10th.  A 2/3 majority is required.  Park will reportedly resort to the Courts in the event an impeachment is started, delaying the impeachment for several months. Park's Saenuri (conservative, pro-US, pro-security) Party lost its majority (-35 seats to 122) in the 2016 Parliamentary elections.  Recent events will make the 2017 Presidential election a severe challenge for the Party.  The New  Politics Alliance for Democracy (liberal, somewhat anti- US, willing to compromise with NK) Party lost 4 seats to 127 in the 2016 Parliamentary elections, while new People's Party (Centrist) gained 38 seats, and Independents gained 8 seats to 11.  Ban Ki-Moon is committed to he Sec Gen position until Jan. 1st, and reports are that he will return to SKorea by the middle of January 2017.  Given Park's ability to delay the new elections, Ban may have enough time to run if he chooses.  Ban is currently listed by Wikipedia as an \"Independent\", and as the Saenuri Party disintigrates, would need to decide on a party, or possibly create an new conservative party (from the 2016 Parliamentary results it appears the defectors are moving mostly to the Centrist People's Party).  A second concern will be the UN Secretary General requirement listed below: (b) Because a Secretary-General is a confident of many governments, it is desirable\nthat no Member should offer him, at any rate immediately on retirement, any governmental\nposition in which his confidential information might be a source of embarrassment to other\nMembers, and on his part a Secretary-General should refrain from accepting any such position. Kurt Waldheim was the only other UN Secretary General to run for President, although with a 5 year delay.  Ban may point out that he is not \"accepting\" an \"offered\" position (as non is on offer), but is competing for a position after an election process.  That might make some sense; however, the restriction on taking a position while in possession of \"confidential information\" related to other UN members , will be more difficult to minimize."], [691, "2016-12-07T21:37:46Z", [0.7], ""], [31228, "2016-12-07T16:40:55Z", [0.85], ""], [30652, "2016-12-07T16:30:04Z", [0.55], ""], [31223, "2016-12-07T13:23:01Z", [0.55], ""], [31209, "2016-12-07T12:00:32Z", [0.5], ""], [31219, "2016-12-07T11:52:29Z", [0.33], ""], [31213, "2016-12-07T09:39:09Z", [0.45], "No real view on this one, but it just seems unlikely career-wise."], [31212, "2016-12-07T09:35:07Z", [0.02], ""], [31214, "2016-12-07T09:26:35Z", [0.35], ""], [31211, "2016-12-07T09:26:13Z", [0.72], ""], [31210, "2016-12-07T07:59:32Z", [0.5], ""], [31203, "2016-12-07T03:49:13Z", [0.32], ""], [31201, "2016-12-07T03:29:51Z", [0.33], "It doesn't make sense as a career transition."], [31200, "2016-12-07T02:55:39Z", [0.75], "Fairly certain it will happen."], [31199, "2016-12-07T01:40:37Z", [0.5], "No real view on this so 50/50"], [31196, "2016-12-07T00:14:47Z", [0.35], ""], [31181, "2016-12-07T00:09:26Z", [0.45], ""], [31191, "2016-12-06T23:56:09Z", [0.4], ""], [31192, "2016-12-06T23:45:48Z", [0.5], ""], [31193, "2016-12-06T23:45:00Z", [0.65], ""], [691, "2016-12-06T23:41:23Z", [0.72], ""], [31187, "2016-12-06T23:31:09Z", [0.01], ""], [31188, "2016-12-06T23:27:34Z", [0.68], ""], [31180, "2016-12-06T23:24:57Z", [0.9], "He needs a new job, things are looking rocky for the current prez"], [31185, "2016-12-06T23:21:02Z", [0.08], ""], [31184, "2016-12-06T23:20:28Z", [0.15], ""], [31179, "2016-12-06T23:14:47Z", [0.2], ""], [30391, "2016-12-06T16:21:10Z", [0.85], ""], [28731, "2016-12-06T13:56:55Z", [0.23], ""], [31157, "2016-12-06T13:28:28Z", [0.35], "I don't really have credible views on S Korean politics, other than knowing that the incumbent is in a tenuous position. it seems plausible but less than 50%."], [28424, "2016-12-06T12:33:57Z", [0.85], ""], [28414, "2016-12-06T10:27:45Z", [0.91], ""], [31154, "2016-12-06T10:06:18Z", [0.45], "It's unpredictable.
