BABA  needs a 0.96% daily return while Tencent either declines or stays flat for this to be achieved. Daily volatility for both companies is between 1-2% per day and the annual volatility for Alibaba exceeds that of Tencent by 7%. Finally alibaba and tencent are somewhat correlated in terms of market performance however Alibaba is more correlated to overall market performance. That said, further supporting my contention is my belief that Q4 will be a strong quarter for consumption and general market growth. Alibaba will, even if temporarily, exceed Tencents market cap before June 2017. "], [20343, "2016-11-27T19:21:08Z", [0.5], "Let's start by knowing what's the current status: On Nov. 25th 2016,Alibaba and Tencent's market capitalization is respectively $229.77 Billion and 240 Billion (converted from HK dollar to USD at 0.3 exchange rate). As it stands today there is about 11 billion dollar difference that Alibaba needs to gain if no major downward chanbe happens to Tencent's valuation. So the question could be rewritten in to two separated questions: \n1) Will at any time during 2017, Alibaba gain more than 11Billion in market capitalization? \n2) Will at any time during 2017 Tencent market capitalization go down at least by 1 Billion  (I'm assuming 1billion change is min required change in market capitalization that impacts the current difference significantly)? Ok, lets' answer each question separately, then we will bring the two answers together and make a final call. To answer each question, we need the sorta peel the onion layer by layer. Let's start with Alibaba: Whether Alibaba gains 11B in market cap, is dependent on whether Alibaba has any growth catalysts in its pipeline in 2017. What could be the growth catalyst that is worth 11B? The company has to grow its market value by 5% in one year. The only way to do that in the short term is eaither through acquisition or strong execution of current investment plans that shows the stock market that the projected growth rate is even higher than what they priced in the market value. For the later option to be true, Alibaba needs to show stronger than expected growth in its 3 self-declared focus areas: penetration in rural area, expansion in online grocery, expansion in South East Asia. None of these 3 areas are short term endevears that could be fruitful in one year. Also considering the push by Amazon in the same market, Alibaba is facing competition which makes its job a lot more difficult. Reading from the company timeline, they have made investments in service centers and acquisitions in the the online grocery market that supports their growth but I'I not 100% convinced that these will become in fruitarion in 2017. Most likely the main driver would be the acquisition route. Can Alibaba do a major acquisition to drive 11B in market cap? They certainly have the cash and balance sheet to afford an acquisition. Will they? Need to evaluate this further. For now I will give 50% chance that Alibaba can get there because there is no strong evidence against or for the argument. In the course of next couple of weeks I will revisit this probability as more evidences become apparent. Now let's shift the attention to Tencent. Will their market cap fluctuate downward at least by 1Billion in 2017? First and foremost their recent acquisition of messaging app WeChat has sdicersified their revenue sources from games and social media subscription to an ad platform. WeChat keeps adding users and that means higher revenues and higher market\nCap. In the short term the revenue will come from advertising and there is no reason yet to believe that the revenue will stop coming. So my current judgment is that Tencent valuation will go up if anything and not down. At the end of this analysis, there is no catalyst to believe Alibaba wi grow faster or Tencent's growth is hindered. So the only way the valuation could change is due to Market fluctuations and that probability is really not predictable. I will conclude there is no reason rather than normal fluctuations for Alibaba to take over Tencent until further information becomes apparent. Hence 50% equal weighted answer at this point.
