Roberts, Alito, and Gorsuch appear firmly against the ruling. Sotomayor, Kagan, and Breyer seem to support the plaintiffs. I imagine Thomas and Ginsburg will vote on opposite sides, leaving Kennedy as the swing vote. Which issue Kennedy focuses on will affect the final decision.

However, if he weighs on the second issue, that corporations can be sued just like individuals in the US for crimes conducted in foreign territory (e.g. independent military contractors committing crimes in war zones), he may swing yes.

Therefore when making my prediction I merely considered whether or not this case met the standard set forth in the statue that dictates if a party has standing. \nThat standard is as follows;\n\"Suits can be brought against corporations for involvement in human rights violations abroad, so long as the corporation had sufficient contacts with the U.S., acted together with a government entity or official and had sufficient control over the violations\".\nFirst it's known the bank has enough contact with the USA to meet that component of the requirement . Secondly we know it worked with the Palestinian Authority as well as the  Israeli government,therefore it worked with a government entity meeting  the second component of the standard. And in considering the third component it would be logical to assume that the banks board of directors could surmise the purpose of the monies that it funneled to and from known terrorists.However the banks knowledge that it was a conduit for terrorist activities, isn't indicative that it had any control over the terrorist acts/human rigths violations.
