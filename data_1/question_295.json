I thought that there was a decent chance Superforecasting would be on it because all month Amazon has shown it in the top 10 business books.  It is not.   I think that the reason Amazon has had it in the top 10, and NYT doesn't is because the Amazon category is more specific and narrow.    There's still a chance it could show up on the list for December, which is likely to be posted 1/2/17, but I am battening the hatches and yelling,  \"Dive! Dive!\"  in part because this question says, \"between\", meaning that the December monthly business best seller list is unlikely to be posted in time to count. Had forecasters been given more training and  had thus clearly & accurately forecast the outcome of the US presidential election, I think the book would have become a best seller because so few polling/political analyst organizations got the election forecast correctly.   Had GJO forecasting pages been designed to require forecasters to post 2 forecasts, simultaneously--one based on hope ( what one wants to see happen), and one based on expectations (what one thinks is going to happen)--forecasters might have been able to tease apart their biases from their judgment and post more accurate election forecasts.    One of the display options on the GJO website for questions gives the crowd forecast such prominence that I think forecasters become unconsciously influenced by it, knowing that the research claims that the crowd is wise.  And because leaderboards are based on accuracy scores--how much more extreme one's forecast is than the crowd's--a game of leap-frog towards the poles can develop.  Both of these things lead to the creation of an ever-louder echo chamber. It's a great pity that in setting up the website as it has,  GJO is reaping in terms of accuracy, influence, and book sales, as well as forecaster morale, what it has sown."], [691, "2016-12-02T13:22:12Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-12-01T12:21:47Z", [0.0], ""], [30930, "2016-12-01T03:32:06Z", [0.55], ""], [1262, "2016-11-30T18:07:18Z", [0.05], "decreasing slightly.

I think a story about Brexit, Turkey, and Hungary would be quite an interesting PR, since the market also wants to see us fail. Or to bring stories about Zika, the French invasion that didn't happen, or whatever stories the journalists need.

It's quite clear that most former GJP forecasters will not buy the paperback version, and therefore these windfall profits will not matter, anymore. Mr Tetlock did a great job in going to the tec world, like the Long Now Foundation, Econtalk, or Freakonomics radio to bring early adopter audiences to us. Now comes the hard work: The Rest of us.

Patti Smith has a niche audience. \"Superforecasting\" depends a lot on online sales, so Amazon's ranking is important. I'm not seeing any reason for sales to surge before the end of the year. There may be some purchases for assigned reading in university courses; if people buy through university book stores, I don't think it will count. In any case, most of that should be past by now.

Here's what I've learned: \n-not every book bought counts. NYT counts only some sellers' sales. Grocery stores probably don't count, but independent booksellers' sales get extra weight. Airport sales may not count. \n-a sales peak during one week is all that's needed because the counts are weekly. Every week is a new race. \n-if the book physically ships out of the book seller\u2019s warehouse weeks before the pub date, it goes from \u201cpre-order\u201d status to \u201csold\u201d \u2014 and thus, it does not get counted in launch week \n-bulk orders are weighted differently. If this book is used as a textbook, not every sale will count \n-500-1,000 sales are needed to hit Amazon's list, and the NYT list is assumed to require 10x that: 5-9k \n-there's seasonal variations, so the bar raises & lowers.
