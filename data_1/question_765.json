And/or, how difficult?\n* How often does the UNSC meet? How are meetings scheduled?\n    - And what does it take to call an emergency meeting? I assume current issues (based on info found, below) isn't likely to mean an emergency meeting.\n* Are upcoming UNSC agenda published anywhere?\n* What events led to this Q being asked in HFC?\n* Who might be perusing a resolution wrt Somalia? ------ From the S.C. Resolutions page linked in the question: * Resolutions primarily look like meeting minutes, mostly recognizing different aspects (+, -, or neutral) of hot topics.\n* Short term trend: Two recent resolutions (Nov 7 & 14), concerning Somalia. By itself, would seem highly likely to have more.\n* Important: From the 7th, mostly about piracy near Somalia. So keeping an eye out for news on piracy in the region. No call for followup on any specific dates, except \u201cwithin 9 months,\u201d \u201cwithin 11 months.\u201d\n* ANOTHER Q: Is Somalian piracy seasonal? If so, does it usually get worse in Nov., such that we may expect more activity from the UNSC, to address it? It's an equatorial country, though.\n* From the 14th, mostly about Somalian government and sovereignty: Al-Shabaab, ISIS; corrruption in government/talk of targeted sanctions on corrupt actors, and/or bans on certain materiel. \u201cSomalia and Eritrea Monitoring Group\u201d mandate extends to December 15. ------ [Provisional Programme of Work of the SC - Dec 2017](https://www.un.org/en/sc/inc/pages/pdf/pow/powmonthly.pdf) Found this.
