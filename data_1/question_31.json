This *could* be supportive to crude through year end, as the decision would likely cause the dollar to be under serious pressure. If the fed hikes, I have no idea where the bottom is in oil--it could conceivably be MUCH lower, considering OPEC, and weakening global industrial growth (demand). I'm increasing the chance of <34 ONLY slightly (by 5%), as I believe the fed will begin posturing for \"no hike\" in an attempt to stem declining economic trends, particularly in commodities, oil, and high yield credit.

Futures for Jan. delivery are just above 41, so it feels like market participants are not predicting further falls... but as we know the market's often wrong so I'm not placing a lot of weight on this data point. There are a couple of factors at work pushing the standard deviation derived probability estimate down. First, US oil rigs continue to drop slowly and production remains either static or decreasing. I have assumed this is the primarily supply of WTI crude and would indicate a static or increasing WTI spot price. Second, US refineries are coming off of seasonal maintenance at the end of November through mid December. Crude stockpiles appear to be beginning to fall (http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/11/06/us-usa-refining-kemp-idUSKCN0SU39420151106#ZCzCZ0cyHT6T5zql.97) as refineries return to average levels of production, which would increase demand for crude to turn it into refined products (gasoline, propane, etc.). Third, I'm making a broad judgement that OPEC is not able to increase production beyond the level of the additional refinery draw on existing supply of WTI crude (c. 500,000 - 900,000 bpd). There is a correlation between OPEC production and global oil prices and WTI prices due to arbitrage. The OPEC meeting in December bears watching carefully but my feeling is that impact on WTI crude SPOT prices will be minimal (but have a much larger impact on futures)."], [1575, "2015-12-01T05:18:47Z", [0.89, 0.01, 0.1], ""], [1575, "2015-12-01T05:17:29Z", [0.51, 0.4, 0.09], ""], [12225, "2015-12-01T05:10:44Z", [0.2, 0.75, 0.05], ""], [12224, "2015-12-01T05:01:17Z", [0.77, 0.12, 0.11], ""], [12218, "2015-12-01T04:00:32Z", [0.9, 0.0, 0.1], "The lowest price to date is 39.27, the OPEC decision at the end of the week may cause the price to decline further.

If the trend that started since my last prediction holds, then it'll go below $34 by the end of December. I added a little more nuance to my method, which is based upon historical trends. I've done linear projections to 31/12/2015 using a number of different time frames (since '86, '05, '10, Q1 '15, Q2 '15, Q3 '15). I've also assigned weights to the different time frames, with a bias around 1/10/2015. Hence the probabilities are based upon the weighted average of the predictions (e.g. if the sum of the timeframe weights predicting below $34  is 5, and the total sum of timeframe weights is 20, then I would put 25% for <$34).

Off the coast of Texas, a line of roughly 40 tankers has formed, waiting to unload their crude or, in some cases, for a willing buyer to come along. Similar scenes are playing out off the coasts of Singapore and China and in the Persian Gulf. There is little sign that the logjam will ease, as the price of oil continued its yearlong plunge this week, declining by nearly $10 a barrel. The renewed collapse in crude prices is helping to again drive down gasoline prices for American drivers, to a national average of $2.19 a gallon for regular gasoline on Friday, according to the AAA motor club. That is 9 cents below the price a month ago and 73 cents below the price a year ago. The slide in oil companies\u2019 fortunes has been significant because of expanded production in Russia, Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf states, as well as a slowdown in demand growth in China and the expectation by commodity traders that the Iran nuclear deal will introduce large quantities of oil to the glutted market. The surge in production has led to a global stockpile of three billion barrels of crude, roughly the equivalent of a month of world oil production. The global market has not been this saturated since 2009, when demand for fuel plummeted. \u201cThis massive cushion,\u201d the International Energy Agency, based in Paris, noted in a report on Friday, has produced \u201can unprecedented buffer against geopolitical shocks or unexpected supply disruptions.\u201d The report helped to decrease the price of West Texas Intermediate, an American benchmark in oil pricing, by more than a dollar at one point on Friday. It almost reached $40 a barrel, its lowest level since last summer and before that in 2009. Oil prices were above $100 a barrel as recently as the summer of 2014. The glut has left the tanks in Cushing, Okla., and other domestic supply depots brimming. The Energy Department noted that American crude inventories had grown last week to 487 million barrels and were nearly a third higher than a year ago. It was the seventh weekly increase in a row. Despite the glut, tankers full of African and Middle Eastern oil are still making their way to the Gulf of Mexico, in part because markets in Asia are also oversupplied. But energy experts say that despite the huge stockpiles, the oil market could easily be shaken by a crisis in the Middle East, like a major terrorist attack in Saudi Arabia or a collapse in Iraq, and prices could soar again. \u201cThe market is myopic,\u201d said Steven Wood, a managing director at Moody\u2019s Corporate Finance Group. \u201cThere is no spare capacity in the world. The market isn\u2019t pricing in any risk, geopolitical risk, for oil.\u201d Still, Moody\u2019s projects that oil prices will rise slowly, to an average for West Texas Intermediate crude of $48 a barrel in 2016 and $55 in 2017. The global Brent benchmark, now just under $44 a barrel, will rise to $53 in 2016 and to $60 in 2017, Moody\u2019s projects. Behind the low price projections is a sluggish world economy, experts say. The I.E.A. report on Friday suggested that world demand growth for oil would slow in 2016 to 1.2 million barrels a day after reaching a five-year high of 1.8 million barrels a day in 2015. Low commodity prices and tight financing have forced oil companies in the United States to decommission more than half of their rigs, leading to tens of thousands of layoffs in oil states like Texas, North Dakota and Oklahoma. To keep their leases, and unwilling to pay while drilling rigs already under contract stand idle, many operators are drilling wells without completing them \u2014 meaning that as soon as prices begin to revive, they can quickly complete the wells and begin production, thus forcing prices down again. Behind the low price projections is a sluggish world economy, experts say.

That they can maneuver the legal title of the inventory to an entity that reports separately while retaining control of the inventory is a great example.

The following item is found in the link provided by @ed3 ( https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/34432 ): \"Cushing, OK stock was -0.79-M bbl to 53.33-M bbk. Utilization rate +1.2% to 87.6%.\"\n1) Unless I am missing something, the implication of this statement (Cushing stocks going down yet capacity utilization going up) is that either: a) storage capacity was reduced (which I doubt) or b) some other grades of oil (and other factors*) share or effect the Cushing storage facilities along with WTI, and the stocks or share of those non-WTI factors increased at Cushing at a rate faster than the stocks of WTI at Cushing decreased. 2) A scan of news articles suggests this 87.6% utilization is near the record rate of 91% set in 2011. Despite the market action last week, which to my (admittedly non-specialist) mind bears the indications of a manipulation, the Cushing capacity utilization crunch has not gone away. In addition, despite the hype that low prices are driving out WTI producers and closing wells, \"WTI Crude Oil production [nevertheless] rose 3.15% to 4.88-M BPD\" last week. Assuming storage capacity utilization increases at the rate it did last week, Cushing will be full in ten weeks, nine of which are in the window of this Question (reporting lags a week). Since Cushing has never before been in a situation where its capacity has been tested, it is an open question as to what the real, actual, true physical storage capacity is, as such actual capacities are typically found to be +/- of the estimated capacity. *Background info on Cushing stocks versus storage capacity utilization\nhttp://www.oilandgas360.com/cushing-inventory-still-has-room-for-now/\nhttp://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=20472\nhttp://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=20212\nhttp://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/03/18/fears-grow-that-oils-about-to-hit-the-tank-tops/ [Edit (5-Nov): I disavow this analysis, given that it seems the original \"utilization\" stat referred to is refinery utilization, and not storage utilization.

For 2015, this has been well above $40/barrel, hence a forecast of 80% for >$40/barrel. However, the exception in the past 5 years is the last year when oil prices fell off a cliff. My understanding of the driving factors is that there is both a glut in the supply (Frackers, Saudi Arabia doing it's best to take on Russia and Frackers) and a demand shortfall (China and emerging markets in general). Looking at the 4th quarter of 2015, on the demand side, the emerging market situation seems stable but US demand is forecast to drop slightly on the previous year. I think any big shocks down will be on the supply side. Iranian oil sanctions are being lifted, and that oil should be entering the market around the end of the year (I think it unlikely to be within the 4th quarter though). The markets should have priced that in, but there has been disagreement on the impacts. Hence, I have weighed the remaining 20% probability budget mostly (15%) towards a slight reduction($34/barrel < price < $40/barrel), with a small chance (5%) of a dramatic decrease.

Ethanol now more expensive than gasoline. Hard to tease out the true demand for pure gasoline. I would appreciate it if anyone can confirm/disconfirm my assumption as to gasoline futures being based on \"finished\" gasoline (including government mandated ethanol blend). Otherwise, gasoline inventories are reported as \"normal\" for this time of year. Any ideas for key indicators of gasoline demand? House leader pledges vote on lifting export ban by end of month.
