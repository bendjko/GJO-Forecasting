While this is an important part of the process of forming a party, Good Judgment has not seen evidence to suggest they have registered. A recently released message by the FARC indicated in mid-September the paperwork for formal registration was still being worked on and while most coverage points to registration happening in the near future, none of them confirm registration.

The senate voted 52-2 on Wednesday in favour of the law that provides for the \"political reintegration\" of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). The group's inclusion as a legal political party was a key point of the peace agreement signed in November between President Juan Manuel Santos and the FARC.

The rebels, about 300 or so former FARC fighters who rejected a peace accord with the government late last year, want to take over coca cultivation and cocaine trafficking that was abandoned when the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) agreed to lay down their weapons (para. 1-4). While as many as 7,000 fighters agreed to the pact and have turned in most of their weapons to the United Nations, the dissidents refused. They have formed a new criminal gang and now engage in the same lucrative drug trafficking that the FARC had pursued for years, the military has said (para. 6). The FARC's leadership expelled them. Opposition politicians, including former President Alvaro Uribe, are angry the peace accord allows former FARC fighters to avoid prison time and participate in national politics. Many Colombians say the government has not done enough to prevent other criminal groups and FARC dissidents from filling the void and taking over the drug business (para. 6-7). Murphy, H. (2017).

What is necessary to register?\n* The disarmament: veto player is the Colombian Gov AND the United Nations: they have to monitor the disarmament (see: http://thebogotapost.com/2017/03/31/jean-arnault-peace-implementation-needs-to-be-accelerated/). Important person: Jean Arnault, head of the UN mission in Colombia. FARC officially ceased to be an armed group at 27 June 2017; this was mostly verified by the UN and the Gov of Colombia (http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-40417207; https://amerika21.de/2017/06/179127/farc-kolumbien-entwaffnung). However, the full process is intended to be finished by August 2017, and must be certified by the UN mission (http://www.eltiempo.com/politica/partidos-politicos/partido-politico-de-las-farc-103928).\n* They have to form themselves as a political party: something they scheduled for August (http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/05/colombia-law-farc-rebels-role-politics-170511064745893.html; http://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1453048/colombia-law-rebels-role-politics).\n* AFTER that meeting they have to register officially, i.e. the national Electoral Committee has to certify it as a political party (Consejo Nacional Electoral)(http://www.eltiempo.com/politica/partidos-politicos/partido-politico-de-las-farc-103928).  How long will it take for the FARC's political party - given that it will be founded in August - to be officially registered?\n* Unknown!\n* But it has to be before 11 December 2017 if they want to take part in the Congressional elections in 2018. And it is very likely that this will take place since - otherwise - it would blast the core of the peace deal. Given that, it seems reasonable to conclude the following:\n* It is rather likely they will register before the end of the year, to be precise: before 11 Dec 2017.\n* It seems equally likely that they will do so before the end of September and after September to the end of 2017. (There is some speculation if the Gov could tactically delay the registration process since it seems not very popular that the FARC becomes a political party among the voters of the Gov and president: so they may try to lead to the impression that they scrutinized them fairly well; besides this: as long as they wait the FARC's party cannot get access to public funding\u2026 - but it might be possible to develop arguments in favor of a quite fast ratification process by the Gov, e.g. to avoid the impression that FARC had to suffer too much thereby raising their chances at the 2018 elections\u2026) What do other forecasters think?"], [1034, "2017-07-02T07:54:46Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], "Goodbye, Weapons!\u2019 FARC Disarmament in Colombia Signals New Era Casey and Daniels (2017) June 27, states that: MESETAS, Colombia \u2014 As United Nations inspectors slammed shut a shipping container filled with rifles, fighters from Colombia\u2019s largest rebel group cheered on Tuesday morning when their leader declared that they had laid down their arms after 52 years of guerrilla war. It may yet be some time before every weapon the rebels fired in Colombia is accounted for. But the ceremony signaled to the country that the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known by its Spanish initials as the FARC, would no longer threaten Colombians as it had for generations. \u201cGoodbye, weapons! Goodbye, war!\u201d Rodrigo Londo\u00f1o, the FARC leader known as Timochenko, shouted to the fighters. The rebels have abandoned their battle camps for demobilization camps like the one in a lush stretch of countryside near Mesetas \u2014 temporary settlements of tents and drywall buildings where the rebels have been slowly handing over their weapons, 7,132 at last count. Some rifles will remain at the camps for security purposes until Aug. 1, the United Nations inspectors said, and rebel weapons caches were still being examined. But for the most part, the inspectors said, the disarmament is essentially complete.  The weapons have been packed for shipment out of the country, to be melted down and used to build monuments. Rank-and-file rebels will soon be free to trade their fatigues for civilian clothes and begin new lives. And the FARC is laying plans to become a political party, much like the parties that emerged from guerrilla groups in post-conflict El Salvador and Guatemala. The Colombian government must now tackle a host of challenges under the complicated peace agreement with the FARC, which took years to negotiate. Special tribunals are to be established to settle war-crimes cases, and farmers are to be given incentives to stop growing coca leaf. (The rebels largely controlled the cocaine trade in Colombia.) \u201cThe goal of ending the war has essentially been met,\u201d said Cynthia J. Arnson, the director of the Latin America program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. \u201cIt\u2019s implementing the 300-plus-page document, with 100 different programs and strategies, that\u2019s going to be difficult.\u201d Colombia\u2019s president, Juan Manuel Santos, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year for the peace accords with the FARC, but the deal remains highly controversial in Colombia. Voters rejected the accords by a narrow margin in a referendum last year, with many Colombians arguing that the fighters, who were promised amnesty, had gotten off too easily. After the referendum, Mr. Santos got the Colombian Congress to approve a revised deal with FARC without submitting it to another referendum. But with his term scheduled to end next year, he has been under constant attack from conservatives, including critics who say that the FARC will not reveal all the weapons and cash it has hidden in the jungle, something analysts say is possible. The ceremony on Tuesday offered Mr. Santos a chance to remind his country that peace with the FARC had been awaited by generations of Colombians (para. 1-11). He repeated a mantra heard widely in the camp \u2014 that far from surrendering, the rebels were transforming themselves for a new, democratic fight (para. 26). \u201cWe are not demobilizing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are laying down our weapons to become an open and legal political movement\u201d (para. 26-27).

As a member of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), he had spent his entire adulthood engaged in armed conflict against the Colombian state. Following the 2016 peace agreement between the FARC and the government of Juan Manuel Santos, Ort\u00edz, like thousands of other rank-and-file FARC guerrillas, was to disarm and reintegrate into civil society under the terms of the deal (para. 1). With the FARC due to enter electoral politics later this year, the killings have evoked memories of past atrocities. Following the 1984 peace agreement, a new left-wing political party, the Patriotic Union (UP), was formed by the FARC, the Communist Party and other sectors on the Colombian left. It wasn\u2019t long before the UP\u2019s modest electoral advances elicited a brutal response from its enemies (para. 8). In what is often described in Colombia as a \u2018political genocide\u2019, thousands of UP members, including two presidential candidates, were murdered by right-wing paramilitaries and state security forces in the late 1980s and 1990s. This repression convinced the FARC of the unviability of electoral politics as a means of achieving change and contributed majorly to a sharp escalation in conflict during subsequent years. Terms of the 2016 agreement relating to political participation are designed to prevent any similar re-occurrence afflicting new political actors in Colombia. In contrast to the 1980s, there is broader support for the peace process across the political spectrum, including \u2013 critically \u2013 within a military which was central to instigating the violence of previous decades. However, with the agreement implicit that the state is responsible for post-conflict security, the government must implement mechanisms to ensure the safety of demobilized FARC members once they reintegrate into civil society. The Santos administration, meanwhile, denies the FARC is being targeted, with government officials blaming the murders of political activists on criminal gangs. This situates such killings outside the realm of political, or conflict, violence. Vice-President Oscar Naranjo said that the government \u2018will not permit that these acts return as a constant feature. We are fully committed to establishing the individuals responsible\u2019 (para. 8-11). Mac-William, N. (2017). FARC Still Under Attack Despite Colombia Peace Accords. CaribFlame.

The half-century war killed at least 220,000 people, uprooted more than 6 million, and left some 8 million registered victims. The U.S. invested about $10 billion in strengthening Colombia to fight the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC-EP) and suppress drug trafficking, and actively supported the peace process.\nUnder the deal between the Colombian government and the FARC, almost 10,000 guerrillas will demobilize, transition to civilian life, and be allowed to enter electoral politics. Preventing a resurgence of violence will require reintegrating them into society, compensating victims and returning their lands, and shrinking the socio-economic disparities and political exclusion at the root of the conflict. The government also continues to pursue peace talks with a smaller insurgency, the National Liberation Army (ELN), and faces groups of demobilized paramilitary fighters reorganizing into criminal gangs (para. 1-2).

Conflict between FARC and the Colombian government lasted for more than 50 years, making it the world\u2019s longest-running.  Although a peace deal was voted down in a referendum last year, a modified version passed congress.  Under the terms of the peace agreement, most FARC fighters would receive amnesty while the organization becomes a legitimate political party. However, FARC only met its deadline for handing in the first 60% by Friday, 3 days later than planned.  The group hopes to make the final deadline on schedule, but logistical difficulties in transporting the weapons persist.  If FARC is unable to deliver the weapons on time, it could threaten to destabilize the fragile peace process (para. 1-3). Feldman, J. (2017). FARC rebels to complete disarmament in Colombia.

Otis (2017) Jun 20, states that: There are no guns in sight at a rebel camp in Guaviare, a state in south-central Colombia. Instead, some 500 former members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, wear civilian clothes and pass the time playing soccer and volleyball, while they wait to be reintegrated into society. Several women among them\u2014who while fighting were forced to use birth control and have abortions\u2014\u00adare pregnant or nursing newborns. Another first: The ex-\u00adguerrillas are having to think about how they\u2019ll earn a living now that they\u2019ve laid down their weapons. Raul Andr\u00e9s Ballesteros, 33, who dropped out of junior high to join the FARC, says he plans to study technology and become a systems engineer. Faisuri Mendoza, 29, a 10-year veteran and a member of the Cubeo Indian tribe, dreams of becoming an anthropologist. When Colombia\u2019s government signed a peace treaty with the FARC last fall, it meant more than an end to a 52-year conflict that left an estimated 220,000 people dead and forced more than 5 million civilians from their homes. It also meant 7,000 guerrillas would have a chance to disarm and enter the \u00adworkforce. Whether Ballesteros, Mendoza, and the rest of their comrades find their bearings will go a long way toward determining the fate of Colombia\u2019s peace process. Recruited as teenagers, many of the rebels are illiterate peasants who possess few skills beyond firing Kalashnikovs and patching up the wounded. Should they fail in their efforts to go back to school, find work, and organize a FARC-led political party\u2014goals the Colombian government has pledged to support\u2014they could once again return to the bush. Since the peace treaty was signed in September, more than 300 FARC guerrillas have broken ranks to form a dissident rebel group that\u2019s attacking army troops and shaking down business owners. The dismantling of the FARC\u2019s war machine began in January, when its fighters moved to about two dozen camps on government-leased land, where they\u2019re gradually disarming under the supervision of United Nations monitors. Once that process finishes later this summer, rebels who have cleared police background checks will be free to start their new lives (para. 1-4). Otis, J. (2017).

As of now, the FARC has turned in 30% of its arms, and has extended its deadline for the next 30% until June 20. Complete disarmament is a prerequisite for establishing a political party. A recent arrest of a rebel in violation of the peace agreement is also creating obstacles between the FARC and the government. (http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-40197026) The FARC may be inclined to delay further if it perceives it has leverage over the government. (http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-40155871) Assuming the FARC can meet the June 20 deadine without another extension, the next deadline for it is the March 2018 Congressional elections (FARC stated it will not participate in the Presidential election as a political party - https://colombiareports.com/farc-says-wont-take-part-colombias-2018-presidential-elections/). While seats in the Congress are being reserved (https://colombiareports.com/colombia-peace-talks-in-depth/) and current political parties in Congress cannot run for them, the FARC will likely still want to get its candidates' names out there. Additionally, the peace process is not exactly popular among Colombians, and will likely be a main issue in 2018 (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/democracy-post/wp/2017/05/18/colombias-rebels-are-losing-patience-with-peace/). Thus, it would benefit the FARC to get established sooner rather than later to counter the anti-FARC narrative. Finally, the FARC has asked the Finance Ministry for $1.2M for funding its political party as soon as disarmament is completed (https://colombiareports.com/colombia-provide-initial-funding-farcs-political-party/). This would seem to indicate that the FARC would transition sooner than later. However, the final deadline for complete disarmament is September 1 and the FARC has indicated it will need another 2 months from the end of May (http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Colombias-FARC-Celebrates-Last-Anniversary-with-Arms-Warns-Disarmament-Will-Take-2-More-Months-20170528-0014.html).  For this reason, I'm hedging towards after October 1. Historically, it took the FARC 7 months to establish a political party in the 1980s with the Uni\u00f3n Patri\u00f3tica under the bilateral ceasefire (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriotic_Union_(Colombia) ), at which time the FARC had significantly more popularity among Colombians. With the initial steps taken to establish a party in December 2016, and a requirement to turn in all arms by September 1, I think it will be challenging for the FARC to establish a party before September 30."]], "open_date": "2017-06-13T17:00:24Z", "close_date": "2017-10-09T17:00:33Z"}
