In other words, removing serious criminals is faster than removing just any old illegal immigrant.

None of the explanations for the decline make logical sense to me, so that's all there is to go on. The real number will definitely be 500,000 or under, but the question is whether Trump's rates of ICE removals will look like Obama's first 6 years in office, when there were well above 250,000, or if they will be more like his last 2 years, which were just under 250,000. The answer depends on what factors caused a lower rate of ICE removals in 2015 and 2016. According to ICE, the lower rates were due to Obama's policy of prioritizing removal of criminal aliens (the idea is that when you focus your resources on finding, arresting, and prosecuting the criminals, you have fewer resources left over for removing the non-criminals). \nhttps://www.ice.gov/removal-statistics/2016 The problem with this explanation, however is that Trump has reversed Obama's prioritization policies, and yet ICE removals have not increased. I'm sure the reversal has had some effect, but there must be something else going on to explain the low numbers.\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2017/04/28/politics/trump-deportations-slow/ One possible factor is that rates of immigration to the US continue to decline. It's hard to measure this, but border apprehensions are the best proxy. One problem with this explanation is that there's a huge court backlog of around 500,000 cases. Even if fewer people are arrested, there should be plenty for ICE to deport as the DOJ works through its backlog and orders more people to be removed. What gives?\nhttp://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2017/05/border-apprehensions-down-again-april The backlog has also been proposed--ironically--as an explanation for why removals haven't increased under Trump. Even though ICE is arresting more people, it takes a long time for their cases to be heard and for illegals to be sentenced to removal. The average wait time for a hearing is 670 days. \nhttp://trac.syr.edu/phptools/immigration/court_backlog/ One problem with this explanation is that ICE removals under Obama were often quite high, even though the court backlog continued to increase year after year during his administration. Now this makes no sense at all. I've read in many places that the court backlog is a key limitation in the Trump administration's efforts to remove more people. Why, then, was Obama able to remove nearly 400,000 people per year during his first term in office? \nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-judges-idUSKBN16A2NI Were there more immigration judges serving back then? I doubt it. In July 2016, there were only 273 judges serving. That doesn't tell us how many served when ICE removals were at their peek, though.\nhttps://www.humanrightsfirst.org/sites/default/files/HRF-Backgrounder-Immigration-Courts.pdf Sessions just hired 50 more judges, who will start working sometime this year.

On the contrary, three months is only the beginning of a presidency so it seems to me that there could be some increases in efficiency with time. However, if removals for the very start of the 2017 FY were at 2016 average levels for the Obama admin, then dipped as we've seen, then returned to the 2016 Obama levels, they would still fall far short of 250K (as did the Obama admin in 2016).

I'll just post my response below instead of rewording it for a stand alone post. \n___ Thanks for following up. I've been a bit less thorough on a few questions lately so any impetus to check assumptions is appreciated.  I had actually seen your comment above already and was one of the three people to have given it an upvote. I found the information compelling but had misremembered how the Obama administration's categorizing of ICE deportation statistics had been altered. It seems the change reinforces your prediction of not surpassing 250,000 deportations this fiscal year.  First, here is an excerpt from a July, 2016, report by the Center for Immigration Studies: http://cis.org/Immigration-Enforcement-Deportations-Decline-2016\n\"Most Deportations are Border Cases The great majority of deportations (72%) completed by ICE are border crossers who were initially arrested by the Border Patrol or port of entry officers and turned over to ICE for deportation. Most of the rest are aliens who were arrested in the interior, with only a handful of cases (less than 1%) initiated by other agencies. In previous administrations, border crossers did not make up a large share of deportations credited to ICE. The inclusion of hundreds of thousands of border cases in ICE deportation totals became the basis for deceptive Obama administration claims of \u201crecord deportations\u201d beginning in 2012, when in fact, deportations resulting from interior enforcement were dropping sharply. Exposure of this statistical manipulation by the Center led then-incoming DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson to acknowledge that Obama administration deportation statistics are not comparable with those of previous administrations.2\"\n__________________ So, it seems that a big portion of the numbers from the Obama administration were from people who were caught at the border and returned in a matter of days. If this is true then it would matter how many people are attempting to cross the border illegally and being caught.  According to fairly recent reports this number continues to drop precipitously: http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/may/9/illegal-immigration-southwest-border-down-70-pct/ By Stephen Dinan and Andrea Noble - The Washington Times - Tuesday, May 9, 2017 Illegal immigration across the southwestern border is down a stunning 76 percent since President Trump was elected, with the flow of children and families dropping even faster as analysts say the administration\u2019s commitment to enforcing the law has changed the reality along the border. Overall apprehensions by the Border Patrol dropped to just 11,129 in April, according to numbers released Tuesday, marking the lowest monthly total for any month in decades. The number of unaccompanied illegal immigrant children nabbed at the border dropped below 1,000 \u2014 a level not seen since before the surge that bedeviled President Obama during most of his second term... Border apprehensions are considered a rough yardstick for the overall flow of illegal immigration, so a drop in arrests is believed to reflect an overall drop in the flow of people. At its peak early in the last decade, the Tucson sector, which is just one of nine regions along the border, regularly recorded more than 70,000 apprehensions in a single month. Last month, Tucson reported fewer than 1,500 arrests. Activity has shifted to the Rio Grande Valley sector in Texas, with nearly 4,000 apprehensions in April. Still, that\u2019s a fraction of the 22,000 apprehensions recorded in October and fewer still than the nearly 40,000 arrests at the peak of the Central American surge in 2014.\"\n__________ Given the significant drop in people being captured at the border the easiest means of getting the numbers up will not be available to the Trump administration. Even if interior enforcement is increased significantly, it is very unlikely to make up the difference given that border crossers accounted for over 70% of deportations according to the CIS report linked to and quoted above.  Finally, given that the previous administration manipulated statistics to significantly inflate them versus previous reporting methods, I now think it unlikely that the current administration will be able to do anything to over report deportations by ICE in a consequential manner. Therefore, I am dramatically changing my prediction.

ICE has about 8K agents working domestics investigations per FY16 PresBud (http://immigrationforum.org/blog/the-presidents-fy-2016-budget-department-homeland-security/). As such, to reach the 500K removal number, each agent would need to successfully remove 1 migrant every 4 days between now and the end of the FY. BUT... ...Arrests this year don't matter regarding the number of removals.  Immigration courts are jammed up with a backlog of over 520K cases pending (https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/01/us/deluged-immigration-courts-where-cases-stall-for-years-begin-to-buckle.html?_r=0). So ICE can arrest as many people as they like, but the deciding factor on removals is predominantly the courts. From this article: \"The courts will be a major obstacle for President-elect Donald J. Trump and his plans to deport as many as three million immigrants he says have criminal records. Many of those deportations \u2014 at least hundreds of thousands \u2014 would have to be approved by immigration judges.\" And: \"In the past two years, the administration won increases for the courts from Congress, and the number of immigration judges rose by 65 to about 300 today. But the hiring of judges is glacially slow. With each judge completing an average of 750 cases a year, the courts would need at least 520 judges to eliminate the backlog within one year, according to an analysis by Human Rights First, a watchdog group in New York.\" The immigration courts are so slammed due to delays in filling vacant positions. And politics is a major consideration. From the NYT article:  \"Mr. Sessions could cancel the appointments of roughly 75 new judges selected by Attorney General Loretta Lynch to choose judges to his liking. But it might be a year or longer before they took the bench. And Mr. Sessions would not have authority to summarily reduce the backlogs, lawyers said.\" So the takeaway? To break 500K is nearly impossible, let alone getting over 1M+. This really comes down to the small portion of border arrests/removals ICE performs coupled with the average throughput of the immigration courts. And that 750 cases per day per judge, of which there are 300, comes out to 225K decisions, not all of which result in removals. Examining the trends of the immigration courts and the percentage of decisions resulting in removal will provide better clarity of this. The trend is leaning towards less than 250K.

Assuming ICE has removed approximately 115K people to date (my estimate based on interpretation of data), to get over 500K, ICE would have to remove over 2,500 people/day. To get over 1 million would require over 5,900 people/day, and to get over 2M would require ICE to remove 12,556 people/day. ICE is a fairly small agency, and to expect it to remove over 1M, let alone 2M, people is beyond the abilities of the agency, let alone DHS as a whole. Also, don't forget that removals require ICE to process the migrants through legal processes, and while these can be expedited for a number of cases, there are a number that cannot be simply pushed through. And if ICE decided to start arresting over 12K people a day, it seems likely that the number of legal challenges, not to mention lawsuits by watchdog orgs and NGOs, would slow down the deportation machine, perhaps below current levels. Revising my numbers based on further research. There are no indications that ICE is capable of approaching anywhere near 2,500K people/day, so we're really talking about an over-under on 250K for FY17. And current data and trends favor the under.  Finally, an important note buried in the methodology of ICE's 2016 report (https://www.ice.gov/removal-statistics/2016), is that there is a \"lag\" between numbers on Oct 1 2017 and the final numbers reported out. Since this question ends on 30 Sep, you should factor in a little cushion to account for this \"lag\".
