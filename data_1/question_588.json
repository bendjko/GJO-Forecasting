Of the 314 alerts published under the URL at the end of the question above, 17 (5.5%) contained the word \u201cfamine\u201d and referred to one or more countries. Two of them referred to Nigeria and three to South Sudan. This suggests a very low base rate. However, it seems that alerts referring to famine have become more frequent in the past two years. 50% (9, including the two not directly relevant to the question) of the alerts containing the word \u201cfamine\u201d were published since October 2015. Three of them referred to Nigeria or South Sudan. \nThe above suggests that the short-term base rate was approximately 12% per months that FEWS issues a famine-related warning mentioning Nigeria or South Sudan. This seems like a reasonable base rate estimate for the remaining time. According to their medium term estimates (http://www.fews.net/west-africa/nigeria and http://www.fews.net/east-africa/south-sudan), FEWS does not expect famine to occur in either country until January 2018. However, it is possible that this question is resolved \u201cyes\u201d even if IPC Phase 5 (famine) is actually reached. FEWS alerts more often than not use the word \u201cfamine\u201d in contexts in which such a situation has not yet occurred. 11 of the 19 alerts that mentioned \u201cfamine\u201d in the past 12 years refer to \u201cpre-famine conditions\u201d, the \u201crisk\u201d or \u201cpossibility\u201d of or \u201cthe need to prevent\u201d famine.  The way the question is formulated, such an alert for South Sudan and/or Nigeria would qualify as a \u201cyes\u201d outcome. Despite the improved food security situation, according to the FEWS assessment some remote regions in Nigeria remain at risk of famine. In both countries access to food/humanitarian assistance could be limited by intensification of conflicts (http://www.fews.net/global/alert/june-2017) potentially unaccounted for by the FEWS medium term outlook. This could lead to an alert relevant to this question without an IPC Phase 5 being present.

A substantial proportion of the population in the northeast continues to face Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or Emergency (IPC Phase 4) acute food insecurity, with an increased risk of high levels of acute malnutrition and excess mortality. Less accessible areas remain at risk of Famine (IPC Phase 5).\nAs of September 27th, 4,114 cases of cholera have been reported in Borno State, with 56 deaths and a Case Fatality Rate of 1.4 percent. High concentrations of the outbreak have been reported in the Muna corridor of Jere LGA (1,991 cases), Dikwa LGA (687 cases), and Monguno LGA (1,396 cases), while cases in Maiduguri metropolitan area and Mafa stand at 34 and 6, respectively.

Similarly, the favorable main season harvest which is underway in localized areas has led to increased availability and a decline in staple food prices, improving food access for poor households. Most poor households in these areas are engaged in normal income earning opportunities and are facing Minimal (IPC Phase 1) acute food insecurity.\nHeavy rainfall events and above-average cumulative precipitation in much of Nigeria and the neighboring countries of Niger and Cameroon led to flooding in at least 22 states in Nigeria, including significant impacts in Benue, Kogi, Niger, Ebonyi, and Delta States. In Benue and Kogi States, flooding led to the displacement of over 250,000 people who are currently living in camps. Similarly, some houses have been destroyed and cropped fields damaged. The government and humanitarian partners are currently providing food and non-food support, including access to water for the displaced persons.\nThe preliminary results of a joint WFP/FEWS NET market survey showed that market functioning in conflict-affected areas of Borno, Yobe, and Adamawa States are gradually improving.

To respond, and under the guise of the New Way of Working, UNDP leads on early recovery. We are providing direct support to the most exposed and vulnerable through improved service delivery and strengthening of livelihoods \u2013 including through training of farmers and unconditional cash grants to over 80.000 of the most vulnerable conflict-affected people - and are also helping to reestablish effective community policing. \u2022 In Somalia, UNDP is supporting the implementation of the National Development Plan, which has resilience-building, community recovery, and restoration of state credibility at its core. Our work is anchored in the New Way of Working, and focuses on the root causes of the crisis. \u2022 In South Sudan, some 6 million people are affected by widespread food insecurity and malnutrition, a dire situation that is compounded by insecurity and conflict. UNDP response has focused on building local-level resilience and enabling conditions for peace, security and stability. To this end, we work with UNICEF, FAO and WFP, under the New Way of Working, to restore basic services and sustainable livelihoods and promote access to justice, peacebuilding, and reconciliation. We also work closely with UNMISS support the national dialogue secretariat and establishment of Joint Integrated Police force. \u2022 In Yemen, UNDP is helping to improve the lives of millions \u2013 including women, young people and internally displaced persons \u2013 through access to essential services, rehabilitating infrastructure and implementing emergency employment programs. UNDP Yemen currently implements a portfolio of about $370m, most of which is IDA funding from the World Bank under the New Way of Working framework. In other crisis contexts: We continue to support the Central African Republic in rule of law, reconciliation, restoration of State authority, livelihoods, and durable solutions for returning displaced and refugee populations. UNDP also serves as Management Agent for the Central Africa Humanitarian Fund, to ensure continuity of humanitarian support. In crisis-affected countries across the Arab States region, UNDP complements the work of humanitarian partners to strengthen resilience \u2013 from emergency employment and livelihoods support, to social service and infrastructure rehabilitation, to building social cohesion at local levels. These will be vital foundations to sustain peace in the region, and are central to the $4.6bn Regional Refugee and Resilience Response Plan for the Syria crisis, which UNDP co-leads with UNHCR. Allow me to highlight some of this work at country-level: \u00b7     In Syria, UNDP complements life-saving humanitarian and protection efforts with measures to strengthen resilience of vulnerable and crisis-affected populations. To this end, we are supporting the rehabilitation of basic services for all Syrians, electric networks and early recovery projects, including the removal of a combined 1 million tons of debris and solid waste. Over the first half of this year alone, over 7,000 people with disabilities received livelihoods support. \u00b7     In Jordan, UNDP has been supporting the Government develop its response plan and strengthen donor coordination and aid effectiveness. We have also helped strengthen infrastructure and basic services, benefitting 2.7 million people to date \u2013 for refugees and host communities alike. \u00b7     In Lebanon, resilience-building is the focus of our efforts, specifically to strengthen livelihoods and social stability. Since 2014, approximately 1,000,000 Lebanese and 500,000 Syrian refugees have benefited from implementation of 473 projects in 180 municipalities. \u2022 In Iraq, UNDP is pioneering a new approach to stabilization focusing on speed, functionality and scale. Through our Funding Facility for Stabilization, we work in 28 cities newly liberated from ISIL control and reaching over two million Iraqis returning home. Over 1,100 projects are currently underway, including 400 in Mosul. More than 95% of all stabilization projects are delivered through the local private sector, employing local labor, so enabling faster return of IDPs home. \u2022 In Libya, UNDP leads the Stabilization Facility, which works to improve health, education, and other services for millions \u2013 for example, by rehabilitating and equipping hospitals, medical centers, and schools. In addition, since 2015, UNDP has been supporting national efforts to prevent violent extremism in six countries: Jordan, Egypt, Morocco, Somalia, Sudan, and Tunisia. This work covers a range of priority areas, including support to national capacity and coordination, training and engagement with religious leaders, job creation with focus on youth, research and outreach, and engaging correctional facilities.  A good example is the film Iman, produced by UNDP Sudan, which depicts real-life stories of young people drawn to violent extremism. It is being widely screened to raise awareness of how extremism occurs and the damage it causes. Conclusion In becoming UNDP Administrator, I was conscious of UNDP\u2019s proud history, the evolution and different stages of its existence, and its place at the center of the UN development system, and the global development landscape at large. And I was \u2013 and am even more so now \u2013 very much aware of the importance and trust that our programme countries place in us, and in our ability to provide them with high-quality and professional support, across the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs. Throughout the years I have also had the opportunity to work with so many UNDP colleagues, in the field and at headquarters. And since I came into this position, I have learned to appreciate even more the commitment of our staff, and their dedication to fulfilling our mandates, often under very challenging circumstances. I have also gained an understanding of UNDP\u2019s critical role as a partner in the UN development system, to bring the system together around development solutions. At the same time I am very well aware of how the parameters and expectations for UNDP, and the UN development system as a whole, are changing. The global development context is becoming increasingly complex. Our partners require ever more sophisticated and integrated support. The funding environment is evolving. And our business model is showing signs of stress. There is no room to sit back or for complacency. The pressure to evolve has been there for years, but the opportunity to do so has never been greater than now. Our new Strategic Plan provides a platform to pursue exactly that. I am excited to work with this Board to ensure the Plan provides the foundation on which UNDP can evolve and adapt, so we remain a development partner of choice in our common efforts to translate the 2030 Agenda into a reality for all\".
