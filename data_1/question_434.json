To examine the history of the Libor for the US dollar, we will look at data from the FRED since January 1986. For the Libor to be between 1% and 1.25% it has to grow at least 2% and less than 27% in about two months.\n%\u2206 Pricet =(\u3016Price\u3017_\u2588(t@  )- \u3016Price\u3017_(t-60))/\u3016Price\u3017_(t-60)  x 100%. \nThere are some gaps in the data and from the last two months we obviously do not know what the growth is 60 days later. Of all the 7575 possible 60-day intervals, 2670, or 35,2%, showed an increase in the Libor of more than 2%. However, if one zooms in to more recent times, this percentage increases to 98.4% (See the upwards sloping line in figure 2). We also have to take into account the possibility of the Libor increasing with more than 27%, since it will end up in the interval from 1.25 to 1.5%. The base rate of such an increase, calculated using the data since 1986, is 4.9%. Yet, similar to the 2% increase, the base rate is 35.7% looking at the data from last year. Therefore, if we take last year\u2019s base rate our default position would be: Probability of Libor in interval 0.75-1% is 1.6%, Probability of Libor in interval 1-1.25% is 62.7% and probability of Libor in interval 1.25-1.5% is 35.7%.\nAs one compares figure 2 and 3, the resemblance between the two figures is striking. When the banks expect the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to raise the federal funds rate, as in December last year, the Libor starts increasing before the raise and keeps increasing to about one tenth of a percent point higher than the upper limit of the Federal funds rate. This implies that the Libor mirrors to a large extent the (upper rate of the) federal funds rate. Since the FOMC decided to raise the limit to 1% about one week ago, it is very likely that the Libor will increase to more than 1%. With this information, it is possible to eradicate the 1.6% probability of the Libor not reaching the 1% before the 31st of May. Furthermore, the Libor is also unlikely to reach the 1.25%, since it is rare that the Libor increases to a rate that  is 0.25% higher than the upper limit of the Federal Funds rate. Chances that the FOMC will raise the limit again, in their meeting at the start of May, are slim, since they usually do not raise the rate twice in a row.\nA second indicator for a growth in the Libor is the increase in US 10-year Treasury bond yields. Those have been in decline for a long time and finally seem to be on the way back. The growth of the yields can be explained by the economic situation. Employment is rising and unemployment is arguably falling below is natural level and the inflation is also back on track. The increased yields on US bonds cause an increase in the demand for US dollars. This then results in an increase in the Libor for the US dollar. \nIn conclusion, the Libor is expected to pass the 1% rate, yet unlikely to pass the 1.25%. Because of the expected growth of the Libor to above the upper limit of the federal funds rate, the chances of the Libor being below 1% are zero. I raise the base rate for the Libor to be between 1 and 1.25% to 75%, since it is unlikely that the Libor will increase to more than 1.25% in comparison to the federal funds rate limit of 1%. The chances of the Libor being between 1.25 and 1.5% will then be 25%, since I deem it very unlikely that the Libor will end higher than 1.5%.\n"], [19801, "2017-03-21T04:30:24Z", [0.0, 0.33, 0.67, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [32122, "2017-03-20T21:00:35Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.85, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [34453, "2017-03-20T20:28:33Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.9], ""], [32122, "2017-03-20T18:22:07Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.7, 0.3, 0.0], ""], [32122, "2017-03-20T18:14:59Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.3, 0.7, 0.0], ""], [32872, "2017-03-20T18:08:00Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.9, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [27367, "2017-03-20T13:56:06Z", [0.05, 0.25, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1], ""], [27367, "2017-03-20T13:55:02Z", [0.05, 0.1, 0.4, 0.3, 0.15], ""], [691, "2017-03-20T12:14:35Z", [0.0, 0.51, 0.49, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [19801, "2017-03-20T10:29:22Z", [0.0, 0.25, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [15196, "2017-03-20T05:43:12Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.9, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [34044, "2017-03-20T03:46:16Z", [0.05, 0.15, 0.35, 0.25, 0.2], "A trade war could create a shock offshore USD funding"], [33518, "2017-03-19T23:15:11Z", [0.01, 0.07, 0.9, 0.01, 0.01], ""], [6552, "2017-03-19T22:02:37Z", [0.2, 0.3, 0.3, 0.1, 0.1], ""], [4066, "2017-03-19T21:52:00Z", [0.0, 0.25, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [2200, "2017-03-19T20:11:25Z", [0.0, 0.25, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [10692, "2017-03-19T18:40:05Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0], ""], [1092, "2017-03-19T17:57:20Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.9, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [36, "2017-03-19T14:16:02Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [23409, "2017-03-19T13:47:20Z", [0.0, 0.4, 0.6, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [30517, "2017-03-19T13:06:52Z", [0.0, 0.6, 0.4, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [30517, "2017-03-19T13:06:09Z", [0.0, 0.45, 0.55, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [11885, "2017-03-18T21:31:51Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2017-03-18T15:16:26Z", [0.0, 0.65, 0.35, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [28414, "2017-03-18T10:33:10Z", [0.0, 0.33, 0.67, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [33797, "2017-03-18T05:14:55Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [21884, "2017-03-18T04:47:41Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [33862, "2017-03-18T03:54:45Z", [0.01, 0.35, 0.5, 0.13, 0.01], "Next FOMC meetings are 2/3 May and 13/14 June.
