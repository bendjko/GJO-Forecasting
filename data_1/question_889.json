Gone from his head were the marketers, reporters, coaches, publicists and fans who had labeled him America\u2019s next Olympic star. Gone, too, were the expectations for him to win a medal as the best American figure skater of his generation. A dreadful 17th-place finish in the short program had taken care of that (para. 1-3).
