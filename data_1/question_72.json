The other big component everyone is watching is the removal of thousands of centrifuges, which are used to enrich uranium, and that seems to be speeding right along. One reason the centrifuges seem to be coming out faster than expected is that the Iranians were evidently not very cautious when it came to removing about 10,000 older, inactive centrifuges, known as IR-1s.  Fitzpatrick says Iran may have considered them all but unusable after sitting idle so long, so they just pulled them out relatively quickly. They have been taking more time with some of the other models, but Vaez says the remaining 1,000 active IR-1s should be removed by the end of next week. Some more advanced models must also be dealt with.\n. . . \n\"Iranian negotiators originally predicted that completing its nuclear commitments it would only take two to three weeks, which was never seen as realistic in the West.

One of which is that I find myself just \"not getting\" concepts that other people find so easily grasped. The relation of the IAEA board vote on the PMD to the JCPOA is one such concept. I am just not getting this connection as easily as others seem to. Am I incorrect in thinking that the JCPOA is an independent agreement? The PMD report is a line-item in the JCPOA, something to be accomplished. Is there language somewhere that holds the outcome of the PMD report/vote as having determinative influence on the JCPOA? If not, why are people making such a big deal over it? I'm just not getting it. While I can't help but agree with Mr. Hibbs (the author of the above cited article) as to any of his recommendations that fall within the bounds of those \"as is the case for any other state subject to [IAEA] safeguards,\" I must disagree as to any recommendation which suggests any action beyond this. One concept I think I do get, and in fact think I am fairly clear upon, is that of \"good faith.\" To seek to use the IAEA PMD report/board vote as a mechanism to add new requirements to the JCPOA through the back door, so to speak, is not a good faith action. \"Iran attaches huge importance to closing the books on the allegations in its drive to lift all punitive measures against it and wipe the slate clean over its nuclear program.\"\nWhy? It is not, to my understanding, relevant to the JCPOA.

In a note regarding the analyses by @cmeinel and @morrell, I looked into the Arak reactor ( https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/36149 ), and I came to the conclusion, upon scanning portions of the document, that redesign of the Arak reactor was not required to achieve Implementation. The above Jerusalem Post article implies that this is not the case; viz., that the \"signing off\" on the Arak redesign is indeed required. And, in addition, that one signature remains outstanding; although no indication is given as to who that would-be signatory is. Since this is a definite conflict, I went back and reviewed the Agreement as to Arak. The JP article is correct, and I missed this requirement. As I understand it now, an international partnership is to be formed that will \"certify the final design.\" As to Implementation Day, Iran must \"conclude an official document that would define the responsibilities\" of those international partners in the process of certification of the final redesign. So it's not the redesign that is required, but a document defining responsibilities as to redesign certification. [I could, but will not, plead that my error arose from the fact that the Agreement contains a typographical error -- a reference to paragraph 3 when they meant 8. I simply missed it.] This is an example of what I meant when I said earlier that beyond the efforts of Iran, the goodwill of the IAEA and other parties will be critical as to Iran achieving Implementation. Who knows why the signatory has not yet signed the document, but without that signature, no Implementation Day. And, just for completeness, Iran is also required to \"make available for export\" their \"excess\" supply of heavy water.
