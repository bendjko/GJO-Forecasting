(This option may not be accounted for depending on criteria for what constitutes an extension.)\n4) Hybrid approach, which is my preference and a likely outcome. May Deal is not considered or fails to pass. An emergency EU summit in which a new extension date, with different or no caveats for UK qualifying for extension is proposed, approved by EU, and this date is presented to Parliament which agrees AND ALSO agrees internally as to a plan forward that bypasses the May deal. This may require revocation to avoid unintended hard Brexit aka crash out, but with an internal agreement that Article 50 be invoked again after one or more of the following: \n1) EU election is held and UK contingent is seated.\n3) New UK snap election after 14 April.\n2) New referendum. \n( Mathematically, there is a fair way to do this by splitting the question AND asking a separate, new multiple choice question for type of Brexit v remain.

If the MPs approve May's deal, the EU will then extend the Brexit deadline further to the 22nd of May, thus giving the UK time to pass the required domestic legislation. The EU Parliament must also ratify the deal, but that\u2019s expected to be mostly a formality. Because May was forced to ask for a delay in the deadline, there is a good chance that Brexit will be even further delayed.  The delay creates a precedent, which is the reason why I give it an optimistic 35% likelihood. In this case of events, the Prime Minister comes up with a new plan in 3 weeks' time to move past the political paralysis which is already causing exasperation among other European leaders. However, the Parliament rejected May's plan by 230 votes in January and by 150 votes the second time, which is a massive margin to make up. It is still looking very likely that the Parliament will defeat the proposal once again. I believe it is 15% more likely that the UK will leave without a deal on the 12th of April because an extension beyond this date is only possible if the UK agrees to hold European elections on the 23th of May. While the delay might seem like it impeded the immanence of a no-deal Brexit, I believe that in reality it made it even more likely \u2014 given the very slight prospect of a sustainable Brexit deal passing and the fact that May has said the UK will not take part in the vote. The Prime Minister is left with less and less space to breathe. Lastly, I believe there is a thin chance of 15% that the article is revoked, primarily because the Prime Minister \u2014 who does have the power to potentially cancel it \u2014 has confirmed her strong opposition. Still the chance in my forecast is justified by the petition to cancel Brexit which has reached 4 million signatures. However, the chance is slim considering House of Commons leader Andrea Leadsom dismissed the petition as not being on the same scale as the pro-Brexit vote in the 2016 referendum: 'Should it reach 17.4 million respondents then I am sure there will be a very clear case for taking action,' she told MPs.

He states that a short extension is possible and also feasible to agree on. As stated in previous forecasts, this seems to be more favourable to the EU than a long extension. He also stresses that, despite a Brexit \u201cfatigue\u201d, the EU should be welcoming any effort to avoid a hard-Brexit even if chances are low. The reason why the likelihoods remain unchanged lies in the stated requirements for this extension: no renegotiations about the current withdrawal agreement. However, as stated before, if minor changes would lead to a soft-Brexit then the EU will accept renegotiations in my humble opinion.  It is worth to mention that May\u2019s government asked for a short extension of Article 50 rather than a long one as assumed in the previous forecast. This assumption is based on John Bercow\u2019s block of a third vote if the deal isn\u2019t changed sufficiently. It seems, that May and her government plan to circumvent this block by the Speaker. Furthermore, it shows that they plan to finally gain a majority for their deal in the British Parliament within the extension period rather than risking a hard-Brexit.  This dilemma, the need to change the agreement while the EU isn\u2019t willing to renegotiate, poses an uncertainty regarding future developments.

The only way that the UK could now leave the EU on 29th would be via a crash out \"no deal\", which MPs will be allow. A50 could be revoked to avoid a crash out and revoking would happening if the European Council refuses an extension. \nHowever the UK has asked for a \"short extension\" until 30th June and Tusk has said he would recommend a \"short extension\" if the UK parliament voted for the WA (Withdrawal Agreement that May has already agreed with the EU). it might only be until 22nd May rather than the 30th June (i.e before the EU elections, rather than May's date of before the new EU parliament sits)\nWhat Tusk did not say today was, what would happen if the UK parliament did not vote for the WA before 29th March. The reason for not saying now is probably that Mrs May has only asked for a \"short extension\" and the only reason was wanting it that she gave in her letter to Tusk, was to have another to get her WA passed by parliament. \nIt is almost certain that if the UK parliament does not vote for the WA before the 29th March (and unless Mrs May can convince the Speaker that the WA is in some significant way different to the WA that parliament voted down last week, he will not allow Mrs May to even put it to parliament) Mrs May would need to do what she had previously said she was going to do, and sentdTusk another request to extend A50 for a period long enough to change the WA, and explain her plan for getting the WA changed (by a change of PM, a general election or referendum for example). Tusk did not say that he had ruled this option out.\nIn my opinion putting pressure on MP to vote for May's WA in order to get an A50 extension will have little effect because may Conservative and DUP MPs say they would be happy to crash out of the EU, so they (say) that crashing out on 29th Match is better than May's WA.

Both of these possible outcomes should be seriously taken into account, as Theresa May is facing major problems in making the Parliament accept the draft deal with the EU - rejected few days ago, https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47547887 - , and her journeys to find new deal could be not enough. \nOn the other side, if the UK will find a last minute plan to proceed with the Brexit, the EU states claimed to be willing to extend the deadline (https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/mar/20/brexit-latest-news-letter-article-50-extension-pmqs-theresa-may-bends-to-pressure-from-tory-brexiters-and-rules-out-asking-for-long-article-extension-politics-live). Basically, the final outcome will depend on the next 9 days' May's ability to find a Brexit plan sustainable for the Parliament.

John Bercow declared that he won\u2019t allow a third vote on May\u2019s deal if no major changes happened pursuant to a convention about parliamentary proceeding rules from 1604. His decision makes it less likely that May will go for a third vote in the next weeks according to Laura Knuessberg, BBC\u2019s political editor. As a result, so Knuessberg, the British government won\u2019t ask for a short-time extension in order to gain time for a soft-Brexit transition period (under the circumstance that the Parliament voted in favour for it, which seems unlikely anyway). It is worth to mention that these parliamentary proceeding rules could be changed or circumvented in some way. Despite that, it seems that the most reasonable request would be to ask for a longer extension period in order to gain more MPs for a new deal which is also acceptable for the EU. A process which definitely requires more time than 10 days.  The EU itself reaffirmed its stance that a delay will only be accepted if there is a feasible plan for a soft-Brexit without fundamental re-negotiations. However, statements like these could be of tactical nature to improve the EU\u2019s position in possible upcoming negotiations. In my opinion, the EU and its member states are likely to accept renegotiations if fundamental EU laws are adhered to and if this new deal would lead to a soft-Brexit in the end.  Nonetheless, I adjust the likelihood from 9% to 20% in favour for a hard-Brexit due to these new developments. As stated before (in UPDATE 15.03.19): a longer extension period (the most reasonable request by May\u2019s government) would result in the participation of the UK in EU elections which isn\u2019t in favour of the EU and its member states, thus, increasing the likelihood that the EU/one of its members will decline/vote against it.

But the European Union has repeatedly stated that the agreement will not be renegotiated. So we arrive at a \"constitutional chaos\" according to the Telegraph and The Guardian, which reinforces the uncertainty in the event.\n- Meeting at the European Summit on the 21st and 22nd of March where Theresa May will very probably ask for an extension of the deadline. However, the EU has warned that any extension must be duly justified and accepted unanimously by the 27. According to AFP, for France, an extension of the negotiations is \"neither obvious nor automatic\". Europeans want a \"credible initiative\" to avoid a divorce without agreement. Nathalie Loiseau, French Minister for European Affairs, said that \"if no decision is made, the date of March 29 will fall, and it will be a non-agreement\". Alternative to a vote bypassing Bercow and therefore Brexit March 29 with an agreement (May announced to redo the agreement in Parliament by March 20):\n-According to Nikki Da Costa, a former legal adviser to the Prime Minister, Theresa May could use a \"motion\" to prove that there is a majority in the House of Commons for another meaningful vote despite Bercow's statements.\n-The possibility of allowing MPs to decide whether or not to ignore the 400-year-old convention invoked by John Bercow, and whether they vote in that direction to submit the withdrawal agreement a third time next week. So there is a lot of uncertainties about this unprecedented event, and we can not say for sure what will happen in the next few days.

We should also note the possibility of Theresa May's unpredictable turn-around, which will unexpectedly result in a re-vote and thus validate the revised Brexit agreement by the Parliament, thus carrying out Brexit on March 29 without extension (20%).\nWhatever happens, the decision can be taken up to an hour before the official date of Brexit, which reinforces its uncertain character."], [1333, "2019-03-19T18:03:25Z", [0.0, 0.55, 0.45], ""], [411, "2019-03-19T17:34:21Z", [0.0, 0.95, 0.05], ""], [22833, "2019-03-19T17:05:51Z", [0.0, 0.6, 0.4], ""], [22833, "2019-03-19T17:04:57Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [67986, "2019-03-19T12:12:12Z", [0.0, 0.87, 0.13], ""], [34376, "2019-03-19T10:44:03Z", [0.01, 0.98, 0.01], ""], [691, "2019-03-19T10:37:00Z", [0.0, 0.69, 0.31], ""], [67430, "2019-03-19T09:29:34Z", [0.02, 0.8, 0.18], "UPDATE 19/03 Given the latest events, with the rejection of the new agreement reached by May and Juncker and  the Speaker arguing that there couldn't just be a rerun of the vote on 12 March, it seems unavoidable that Brexit will be postponed.

(There is no way that EU will deny this extension request lest it would be blamed for the chaos with a quick no-deal Brexit).  What is going to happen after 29 March?  While it is not part of this challenge question, but it is most interesting. We can get insights of what is going to happen by examining the various parliamentary votes.  The May Brexit deal was defeated twice in the UK Parliament by large margins (432 versus 202 for the original deal, and 391 versus 242 for the modified deal).  These votes mean that May's Brexit deal does not have majority support in the Parliament.  It does not mean that Brexit does not have support. The vote on no-deal Brexit is most revealing.  No-deal Brexit was rejected by only 4 votes (312 versus 308) with 30 MPs not voted.  It could have past easily.  Although this particular vote does not have much legal standing, it reveals clearly that the pro-Brexit sentiment in the parliament is much stronger than what was shown in the May Brexit deal votes.  I am surprised that there are 308 MPs willing to go for Brexit with no deal. The path to Brexit for these 308 is narrow.  A long extension could possibly lead to a second referendum which could result in a soft Brexit or no Brexit at all.  EU has already said a short extension is not useful unless UK can agree to a deal.  It looks like the modified May Brexit deal is \"hardest\" Brexit deal that UK can get.  So the hard Brexiteers (the 308 that voted for no-deal Brexit, and possibly more in the 30 that did not vote)  have to make a choice soon: a not-so-desirable Brexit or no Brexit.  Since they are willing to risk a no-deal Brexit, it is likely that they will vote for May's deal between now and 29 March.  If that is the case, then Brexit will happen after the short extension.  This would save UK (and the world) from further drama and economic risks. Comments?

(The minor changes regarding option 1 and 3 are explained in the last paragraph). The uncertainty regarding this forecast is based on the future decision of the European Council, respectively the stances of the remaining EU member states, if the EU should accept or decline the extension request. The final decision to remain with the initially set likelihood for the second option is rooted in the comparison of arguments for and against an extension of Brexit out of a European perspective:  AGAINST: \na) EU states are unwilling to agree on an extension which results in negotiations of a completely new deal\nb) Disbelief in British government managing to pass a withdrawal agreement which makes an extension useless for the EU \nc) A long extension period would mean that the UK would have to participate in the EU election in May. Fear of \u2018revenge votes\u2019 from British citizens limits willingness to grant an extension  FOR: \na) Despite the official statement that the EU doesn\u2019t intent to re-negotiate the last deal it could still be possible that EU officials agree on a new deal with minor changes if this one is likely to pass the British Parliament. The recent decisions in the UK might send a signal to the EU that there is a realistic chance for a soft-Brexit \nb) Short time extension would allow a smoother transition with more laws implemented by UK/EU to mitigate social/political/economic risks \nc) A longer extension period would enable major political changes such as withdrawal from Brexit or a general election within UK. \nThe result of this comparison is that the EU should be definitely in favour for a short-term extension as the efforts/costs to do so are fairly limited while the possible outcomes would mitigate social/political/economic damages to the EU. A long-term extension is less likely due to its implications on EU\u2019s election in May. The rest chance for a denied extension is mainly based on the possibility of a non-ambiguous decision within the EU Council which derives from a current atmosphere of mistrust. It is possible that some actors might use their voting power to deliberately cause a hard-Brexit. Nonetheless, the decision regarding the Brexit have been coherent in the last two years.  The change of likelihood regarding the first and last option is based on the short time period left up to the 29th of March. It is more likely that a hard-Brexit occurs rather than a withdrawal of the Brexit for three reasons: \n1)\tIt seems unrealistic that May would dare to revoke the Article 50 in the case of a lost voting on her third attempt to pass a deal. She would likely lose the trust and support of MPs in this scenario which limits her capabilities to pursue to revoke Article 50. Aditionally, she is personally against it\n2) The remain faction isn't able to gather enough MPs to force a withdrawal (see last forecast) \n3)\tThe hard-Brexit is still the legally binding result in the case of a failed attempt to pass May\u2019s deal or a failed extension despite the decision of the British Parliament at the 13th of March (see last forecast) Source: \n- Vox 2019: The UK Parliament has voted to delay Brexit"], [63692, "2019-03-15T18:41:55Z", [0.1, 0.7, 0.2], ""], [1333, "2019-03-15T18:14:16Z", [0.1, 0.55, 0.35], ""], [1333, "2019-03-15T18:06:12Z", [0.1, 0.45, 0.45], ""], [63804, "2019-03-15T16:40:45Z", [0.01, 0.75, 0.24], ""], [20156, "2019-03-15T13:53:03Z", [0.1, 0.9, 0.0], ""], [67609, "2019-03-15T12:56:03Z", [0.03, 0.85, 0.12], ""], [67317, "2019-03-15T12:55:21Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2019-03-15T11:45:07Z", [0.0, 0.56, 0.44], "A short extension doesn't give the UK's PM enough time to develop hap or acquire gorm--let alone line up votes--while a long extension introduces many new uncertainties and imponderables.

This gives twofold opportunity for the politicians in power to promote the opinion of revoking Article 50, which would mean stopping Brexit in full. According to the European Court of Justice the decision to revoke Article 50  must be \u201cunequivocal and unconditional\u201d, contrary to its imposition. It seems to me that the chances to be revoked before 30th March, although possible, are relatively low. First, because it is 15th March already and in the Parliament talks about extension of the transition has already started following uncertain trade deal between UK and EU. The decision to revoke Article 50 needs to be unambiguious, which is not possible in the unearthed political situation in the UK, therefore in my view, I see a very high possibility and likelihood of prolonging the process of leaving for the UK due to the unsettled trade deal and the rest of business relations between the UK and EU. While I cannot claim certainty over what will occur in the future two weeks, it seems very unlikely for the last answer- neither a decisions to revoke, nor an extension, because this would leave the UK in a regulatory misbehavior in relation to the EU and it will further weaken its political power. In conclusion, timing is the most important part of the question. UK can unilaterally revoke article 50 before 29th March 2019 when its withdrawal agreement will enter into force. But the UK can also revoke it after that date only if the European Council agrees to extend the transition period of Article 50 beyond 29th March 2019. Having said that, according to news from 14th March 2019, European Council is quite content with the deal drafted, which the UK rejects, and the former is ready for Britain to leave the EU, but it is about the UK maybe being unable as of not ready to leave in two weeks. Moreover, the European elections are coming in May 2019, so if Theresa May and the British Parliament manage to make a diplomatic move towards the EU Council for an extension, this extension would be for no more than a month and a half, as the EU Council would prevent the UK having any power in the elections and drawing more comfortable deal. A decision of revoking would however give an upper hand for the UK to prepare in better terms - meaning if they manage to create a more beneficial gathering of diplomatic ties in the EU following the elections and since no other country has so far left EU or revoked Article 50, this leaves a creativity vacuum for the UK to normatively exploit."], [33307, "2019-03-14T22:25:47Z", [0.05, 0.9, 0.05], ""], [57797, "2019-03-14T21:54:39Z", [0.04, 0.94, 0.02], ""], [578, "2019-03-14T21:09:17Z", [0.0, 0.95, 0.05], ""], [35217, "2019-03-14T20:54:22Z", [0.02, 0.82, 0.16], "The Commons has found something the majority supports, seeking an extension.

Received from https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47564793 Theresa May will make a third attempt to get her EU withdrawal deal through Parliament in the next week. She told MPs that if her deal fails again to get their backing, a lengthy delay to Brexit may be needed. The prime minister's warning comes ahead of a Commons vote later on whether to ask the EU for permission to delay Brexit beyond 29 March. MPs voted on Wednesday evening to reject a no-deal Brexit under any circumstances. No date has yet been set for the third so-called \"meaningful vote\". But BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said that even if the UK is given until the end of June to pass the legislation required to leave the EU, the government will try to do that earlier, if Mrs May's deal is passed next week. Alternatively, there could be a much longer delay, requiring the UK to take part in elections for the European Parliament in May, the prime minister has said, in the event her deal is not approved. The updated motion, to reject a no-deal Brexit under any circumstances, was passed by 321 to 278, a majority of 43. However, Wednesday's no-deal vote is not binding - under current law the UK could still leave without a deal on 29 March, unless an extension is agreed with the EU.\nSpeaking after the result of the vote was read out, Mrs May said: \"The options before us are the same as they always have been. \"The legal default in EU and UK law is that the UK will leave without a deal unless something else is agreed. The onus is now on every one of us in this House to find out what that is.\" Financial Times Website. (2019). Brexit vote: MPs knock back chance to take control of process \u2014 live.

The government has until then to win over the DUP and their Eurosceptic Tory allies, and probably some Labour MPs. It is a tough ask. Although the margin of defeat narrowed at the second vote, it remained one of the biggest government defeats in history. And this time there is unlikely to be any new information from the EU to help sell the deal. Bookies don't like the deal's chances - at least not at the moment. These odds are taken from Paddy Power, and suggest that MPs will vote it down again. A lengthy extension to Article 50 would come next. But moves are afoot. The DUP said earlier it was talking to Downing St in the hopes of finding common ground, while Eurosceptics are discussing various legal points in a bid to change their own minds. Brexit likely to be delayed Brexit is now very likely to be delayed, writes the FT's Seb Payne. MPs have just voted in favour of pushing back exit day until 30 June 2019 - if there is a withdrawal deal. This is the government\u2019s \u201cshort technical extension\u201d to ensure the UK can make a smooth withdrawal from the EU. But there is also the possibility that the prime minister may end up seeking a much longer extension if she fails to pass her deal. The question now is whether all of the EU27 nations will agree to an extension. The mood in Brussels is that the EU will grant a short extension if it is necessary for Mrs May is put her deal into law. But if the UK decides it wants to request a longer extension, it will likely come with conditions \u2013 such as participating European Parliament elections. This is what Donald Tusk, president of the European Council has said, and Mrs May has warned. Of course, the March 29 departure date remains in British law. The UK could still spill out of the bloc if nothing else passes the Commons before then. But assuming the prime minister fails to get her deal through next week or the week after, MPs are much more likely to opt for delay (long or short) than a crash exit. That was made clear in the votes yesterday and today.

Theresa May and the majority of the Conservative Party still support the Brexit despite disagreements if it should be a soft or hard one. The Labour Party is unlikely to support a remain policy either. Its political leader, Jeremy Corbyn, declared that his target is to trigger new general elections. He will only support the remain camp under the circumstance of failing to trigger new elections. It is worth to note, that Corbyn prefers the UK to leave the EU due to his own political goals of nationalizing parts of the British economy. The group of MPs who are in favour of remaining in the EU aren\u2019t likely to gather enough support to stop the Brexit within the remaining time.  It will be extended by the UK and the European Council -  \nSo far, an extension seems to be the most likely outcome at the 14th of March, because all key political actors would benefit from it. Theresa May would be able to re-negotiate with the European Union to achieve concessions regarding issues which steered controversy within her party and coalition in order to pass a withdrawal agreement (e.g.: through a new solution to replace the backstop clause, hence, regaining popularity within the DUP). Nonetheless, there is still a possibility that Conservative MPs will vote against May\u2019s agreements as happened at the 15th of January and 12th of March, as well as, that Labour MPs will vote against an extension as happened at the 30th of January. The European Union might agree to changes if a new deal is likely to pass the British Parliament as several EU and government officials from different EU-countries stated their preference for a soft-Brexit rooted in concerns regarding the likely economic slump in case of a hard-Brexit. As Labour doesn\u2019t support May\u2019s former deal or a hard-Brexit, they are likely to vote in favour for an extension as this would enable Labour to shift decision-making on Brexit from the government to the parliament or to take over the government due to new general elections.  Neither of the above will occur and the UK will leave \u2013 \nThe British Parliament voted against a \u201cno-deal-Brexit\u201d scenario, thus, decreasing the likelihood of such an outcome. Nonetheless, there is still a chance that such a scenario could occur. As Theresa May stated, this result isn\u2019t legally binding. As long as the Parliament doesn\u2019t vote in favour for a particular agreement with the EU, or if the British Parliament and/or the European Union decline an extension, a no-deal-Brexit still remains the default protocol. Supporters of a \u201cno-deal-Brexit\u201d would vote against an extension in order to force the UK into this scenario, but recent votes demonstrated that the hard-Brexit faction is shrinking indeed.  To summarize the findings above: extending the notification of Article 50 beyond the 29th of March would please most MPs and represent the least decisive decision to go for as it doesn't determine if the UK will leave the EU with a hard-Brexit or won't leave at all.

This seems near impossible.\nExtension of A50 seems most likely. Opposition to Theresa May's deal has been softening, hers is the only Brexit deal on the table, and some MPs who originally voted against her deal are now scrambling as options are limited in the shrinking amount of time and MPs are shifting to support the PM. This is best seen in how  hard Brexiters have begun conceding or seemingly supporting different aspects of the deal. Most notable is the apparent commitment of MPs to the backstop which would maintain Ireland's open border (a political loophole for previous members of May's opposition to shift their stance). Why is this important? If Theresa May gets more support then the prospect of a hard Brexit is less likely.  The Guardian states that \"even if May were to get her deal through in mid-March, she would still need to delay Brexit beyond 29 March in order to pass the necessary legislation.\" This means that Brexit would need to be extended.\nTheresa May does still face an enormous opposition however, and the possibility of the UK leaving the EU before March 30 would most likely be due to a \"no deal\" Brexit.

Taking into account, how committed Theresa May and her government is to Brexit, the possibility for the government to revoke Article 50 seems to be very low. Hence, it would be more likely that such a move would happen only if the government has changed or a second EU referendum is held. 30% - Neither of the above will occur, and the UK will leave the EU\nIn mid-March, three important votes are expected - vote on deal, vote on no deal and vote on Article 50 extension. Considering the resistance in the government (Theresa May won a no-confidence vote in January by only 25 votes) It is considered very unlikely that the government would support and pass the current Brexit deal on March 12. The more likely option is the second vote on no deal. However, knowing the consequences which come with the no-deal options (severe effects on trade and transport, no transition period), it is considered unlikely that MPs would vote for this option. Despite that, regarding a number of votes that the UK will have in March, I am not fully rejecting this option.  70% - It will be extended by the UK and the European Council\nI consider this option to be very likely. First, as I explained my arguments above, support for the Theresa May deal is seen as very unlikely. As well as an option of no-deal because of severe consequences that would follow. It is very likely that the UK choose to ask for an extension of the Brexit that would lead to a second referendum or another no-confidence deal and new elections. Even though EU leaders do not agree on how long the deadline could be extended, a short-term extension (3 months) is very likely to be supported by all 27 EU member states.

Moreover, She has stayed adamant throughout the Brexit process, making it highly unlikely that she would change her mind now. The only way I could see the UK revoking Article 50 before March 29th would be if Theresa May was ousted as Prime Minister. However, she was just barely able to survive a vote on January 19th. Finally if another vote of no confidence is called and succeeds, then there would too little time to form another another and to shuffle around the leadership and March 29th would probably come up before the new government is settled. Therefore, under this scenario I predict the European Council would respectfully extend the deadline to give the new UK government time to decide what to do about Brexit. Thereby I predict that there is a 0% chance of Article 50 being revoked.  I predict a high likelihood that the deadline will be extended based on the unlikely scenario explained above plus the fact that leaving with no deal is beneficial to no one and hurts everyone. Theresa May and the European Council are essentially playing a high stakes came of chicken and seeing who will flinch first. The difference being is that Theresa May does not have the ability to flinch due to her inability to get Parliament to sign the deal. Therefore, the decision of when and how the UK leaves the EU is mostly up to the European Council. The European Council is mostly made up of rational European leaders who would understand how much the UK leaving without a deal would effect them. Therefore, I find it highly likely that as the deadline approaches they'd become more and more willing to extend the deadline.  That said, it is possible that the EU in this instance has grown a spine and hotter heads in the Council might prevail. Therefore, I'd give the UK a 15% chance of leaving with no deal. Whereas I give the UK only 10% chance to leave with a deal.  This is because the deal has already been rejected by Parliament. Moreover, within May's own party I do not seen the far right brexiteers voting yes, because for them leaving with no deal is better than leaving with the current \"soft\" deal. Therefore, May must obtain votes from the Labour Party, who are opposed to leaving in the first place. However, it remains possible that as the deadline comes closer and closer and there is no resolution that members of the Labour party, upon realizing that Brexit is inevitable, will pick the lesser of two evils and vote for the deal.

First, neither the the conservatives nor Labour support revoking attempts (https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/comment/brexit-tories-labout-eu-uk-single-market-customs-union-jeremy-corbyn-theresa-may-a8386526.html). This holds true even after Corbyn and thus Labour\u2019s latest repositioning in favor of a second referendum (https://www.politico.eu/article/jeremy-corbyn-brexit-labour-backs-second-brexit-vote-to-stop-theresa-may-deal/). The dominance of Brexit supporters, both radical and moderate in the conservative party will prevent any withdrawal attempts on the part of the Conservatives. The same applies to May\u2019s conservative government. Her Brexit course and categorical denial to revoke the Brexit so far, as well as the fact that her political survival depends on the further implementation of the Brexit speaks for itself. Even if Labour could assert itself with its idea of a second referendum, polls haven\u2019t changed since Brexit (https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45098550). Even if a majority would vote in favor of remaining in the EU, the win would be most likely narrow and the referendum\u2019s legitimacy would be highly contested. Thus, the obstacles to Britain's remaining in the European Union are so high that this scenario can be ruled out. This week (CW 9), the events have overturned. May had to give up her resistance to the postponement of the exit date, which she had so far categorically ruled out. Due to pressure from more pro-EU members of her party and government, as well as the fact that there is only little time left (https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47352446), May presented a three steps plan: On the 12th of march the parliament will be asked to vote on her modified Brexit deal with the EU, in case of a rejection, the parliamentarians will vote on an exit without deal on the following day. If they oppose that idea, too, the parliament will get the chance to vote on an extension of the negotiations (https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/26/mps-offered-vote-on-no-deal-brexit-and-possible-delay). However, this did not increase the likelihood of the extension to realize - a 30% likelihood is assumed at the forecast at hand.The likelihood have been moderate since some time now with a huge majority in the British parliament, rejecting the idea of a chaotic Brexit (https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/20/mps-to-ambush-may-with-amendments-to-stop-no-deal-brexit) and positive signals from Brussels and its member states (https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/16/germany-and-france-signal-willingness-to-delay-brexit), as well as the tight time plane. However, as described in Answer 3, May\u2019s three step plan drastically increased the possibility of a majority in the parliament in favor of a modified deal.  Imposant for this alternative is that it actually consists out of two: the UK will leave the EU with May\u2019s modified deal or without a deal at all. With May\u2019s announcement of her three steps plan today, the likelihood of the latter reduced drastically, while the other options, a postponed exit, as well as the British parliament accepting May\u2019s modified deal, got more likely to realize. The forecast at hand estimates that there is only a 10% likelihood left, that the UK leaves the EU without deal. The Britisch parliament accepting the deal however, got paradoxically more likely today - the paper at hand estimates now a likelihood of 60% - when May announced the option of an extension of the negotiations. Until now, the Brexit advocates within the conservatives had called for an \"opening\" of the withdrawal agreement negotiated with Brussels to include changes to the backstop solution for Northern Ireland. Their leader Rees-Mogg said in several interviews on Wednesday that he could also be satisfied with an additional protocol (\u201eAppendix\") (https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/tory-brexiteers-soften-their-position-dlwcztcqp).The change of course reflects the growing concern of the Brexit advocates that a renewed rejection of the deal could lead to a postponement of the withdrawal date. With a view to the exit-critical majority in the lower house of parliament, they fear that the parliament could vote in favour of a \"softer\" Brexit or even a second referendum in the extension phase. This first step towards May, also reflects the volatileness of British positions towards the Brexit. With May changing her mind on the extension, the hardliners towards and opening and Labour towards a second referendum, a moving on the British side can get observed. The rising willingness to compromise is most likely to increase further over the next weeks due to approaching exit date. Even though the EU has been very firm on their stances so far, so far they only have excluded an re-opening of the agreement. Thus, finding a compromise, e.g. in the Appendix could be an option, in particular because the EU cannot be interested in a chaotic Brexit either. --> 10%+60%=70%\n"], [67420, "2019-02-27T22:28:04Z", [0.0, 0.3, 0.7], "Comment deleted on Mar 04, 2019 10:09PM UTC"], [1629, "2019-02-27T19:22:06Z", [0.0, 0.8, 0.2], ""], [67423, "2019-02-27T18:30:21Z", [0.0, 0.75, 0.25], "It will be revoked: Theresa May has on numerous occasions rejected the idea of revoking the Article 50 notification and thereby terminating Brexit.

It echoes previous statements made by the prime minister, wherein she has insisted that the decision of the British people must be respected.  It will be extended by the UK and the European Council: In her address to Parliament on February 26th, May stated that should her exit deal fail to be ratified in the March 12th vote, parliament will be asked to vote,  firstly on whether or not to leave the EU without a deal, and potentially then, on a push-back of the date for the Article 50 notification. Several PMs have stepped forward in support of extension in a bid to avoid a no-deal scenario, and it is expected that the extension will be supported by both Labour and Conservative members (https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/26/mays-deal-no-deal-or-brexit-delay-how-will-mps-vote). However, where official EU statements have indicated an openness to talks of an extension of article 50, both France and Spain have recently sharpened their rhetoric, underlining than an extension will not be supported without conditions (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/27/spanish-pm-warns-may-brexit-delay-with-no-plan-not-reasonable-or-desirable). However, despite roars from these large EU states, the EU will likely come to an agreement to allow the extension. The EU is better served with a controlled Brexit and the appearance of a \u2018united front\u2019 is without a doubt most desirable in the face of a British departure.  Neither of the above will occur and the UK will leave EU: It could be that May lets \u2018time work for her\u2019, and that the fear of a no-deal Brexit will inspire some to vote in favor of her deal (https://www.weekendavisen.dk/2019-6/samfund/med-uret-som-medspiller). Similarly, the fear of a delayed Brexit could inspire some hardcore Brexiters to also vote in favor of her deal \u2013 simply to not extend the departure from the EU any further. Hence, May's deal could pass in the vote on March 12th, especially if a change to the back-stop issues is managed. But, his is not a likely feat.  However, it also is a possibility that May and the parliament fail to the agree on an exit deal for the UK and a no-deal Brexit will be realized. However, it seems that a majority is against this outcome, as the political and economic consequences seem overwhelming. \n"], [67465, "2019-02-27T17:15:16Z", [0.04, 0.8, 0.16], "When faced with a difficult situation, people tend to procrastinate. Kicking the can down the road is the best solution right now for almost all parties: Brexit supporters against Theresa May's proposal, Brexit opponents, and the EU. For Brexit opponents and the EU, the best outcome is for there to be no Brexit. But if that happens, it is very unlikely to happen before March 30. The most likely way that could happen is for it to be decided in a second referendum, but holding a referendum requires a minimum of 21 weeks. The second way to revoke Article 50 is for parliament to do so without a second referendum. But that is extremely unlikely, since that would surely spark an angry response from the pro-Brexit camp, and divide the anti-Brexit camp. Support for Brexit has been slowly dipping in the polls, but still remains strong both on the streets and in parliament. For Brexit supporters who are against May's proposal, a delay would also, at least from their perspective, appear to give them time to pursue a different plan. They, too, are probably counting on a second referendum to approve their amendments. There is a minority who still want a hard Brexit; however, even among this group, most are hoping for a backstop solution to Northern Ireland, something that the EU would have no reason to honour after a hard Brexit. As for a reinstatement of a hard border in Ireland, there is as yet no noticeable support for that. Finally, while there are Conservatives who back May's plan, they are more resigned to it than enthusiastic about it. Some, including May, were against Brexit to begin with. If the EU grants an extension, they have little reason to not take it. In sum, I would be extremely surprised if Brexit is canceled before March 30, with or without a referendum. I would be quite surprised if Brexit happens before March 30, either with a hard Brexit or with the UK parliament deciding to back May's current deal.

I assume that no politician from the Conservative Party would take the responsibility to revoke it, it would be a political suicide. That person would appear as a detractor of the public opinion expressed in June 2016, loosing votes and ruin its public reputation.\nMoreover, democracy means also taking risks and responsibilities, and I do not think is not acceptable refusing the result of a referendum according to weather the outcome is manageable and if we like it or not. Some people claim that the Brexit campaign was distorted and distorting, promising a simple and quick solution and a lot of money in the State coffers; and that is was developed in chaotic climate. However, this is not a justification to don\u2019t respect the result: if we doubt of a result, we should treat in the same way the following others. Which is the criteria to evaluate if an outcome is more valuable than another?\nEven if the Labour Party is trying to ask for a new referendum, pushing on the fact that the first one was consultative and non-binding, it would take time to propose it and to find enough supporters. I\u2019m sure this is not going to happen, at least not before than the 29th of March. 60% Extension of Article 50\nThe premier May is trying to build an agreement to satisfy both the various tendencies internal to her party and the EU requests, with the result of not satisfying almost anyone. So far, the proposal of agreement has not been accepted by the English Parliament (January 2019) and the actual one seems to be still \u201cnot good enough\". \nOne of the key issues is that is not possible to suspend abruptly the European regulation, therefore the UK will have to honour its commitment with the EU (and vice versa) until 2030, keeping ploughing money to EU. \nMoreover, there is the problem of the free movements of goods and people. In order to don\u2019t create damages to the economy and to the multinational enterprises, the proposal is to keep the UK in the European Economic Area (EEA), which include EU members and not-members but avoid them to stipulate economic agreement with States outside the European framework.\nIn the end, there is the Ireland issue, where the Republic of Ireland (RI) risk to remain physically isolated from Europe and, above all, from Northern Ireland (NI). In fact, so far, the NI and RI have been divided but thanks to the Good Friday Agreement (1998) and to the fact of being both part of the EU, the tensions between the two have been defused amd the free movement of goods and people guaranteed. If UK and EU won\u2019t find and agreement concerning this issue, in order to guarantee the safety of NI and RI, the UK will have to remain in the EEA. \nIn my opinion, it will be difficult to find an agreement better than this one because the entire issue is very complex, but currently the UK is not satisfied by it and there are still some unresolved issues. Even the President of the European Council, D. Tusk, has recently expressed his preference in making an extension to the Article 50. \nIn conclusion, even if the situation is complex, between the two the EU is the one who has the upper hand: I think that in this moment it is more powerful than UK, can implement easier its strategy and impose its rules, pushing the UK to accept the current agreement or asking for an extension of the Article 50. 40% No deal\nThere are some UK politicians who support the hard Brexit (without any deal), because they think that the proposed conditions and the current results of the negotiation with the EU are not satisfying. They also think that continuing to stay in the EEA (so, ploughing money to EU), would somehow damaging the concept of Brexit itself. However, Brexit without any deal would be unlikely because a huge part of the premier May's party is in favour of a soft Brexit, while the entire opposition prefer having a new referendum or a soft Brexit. They know that a no deal would leave the UK in the chaos, causing economic losses, forcing national enterprises to move away from foreign states and the English citizens without a clear status in the European scene.\n"], [22833, "2019-02-26T15:21:47Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [67625, "2019-02-26T15:07:34Z", [0.05, 0.9, 0.05], ""], [522, "2019-02-26T12:31:43Z", [0.0, 0.95, 0.05], "Updating.

The possibility of a NO DEAL is not excluded (10%), because a parliamentary block is not something new in itself, despite the huge stakes. 40% - It will be extended by the UK and the European Council The January 15 vote by the UK Parliament for May's exit agreement shows the deadlock facing Theresa May's government (432 votes against 202).\nEU said it did not want to renegotiate its deal, leaving the British government to settle the situation for themselves about the fate of the country. Nevertheless, EU is not against granting time by extending the period of Article 50.\nIndeed, some benches of the parliament are for a new perspective of Brexit with a membership of the European Free Trade Area. It could be a compromise between the two camps, and in this case the European Union would agree to extend the date to allow this eventuality. Source: https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46320368 Too much opposition, popular or parliamentary, could thus create the possibility of an extension, to allow to get out of this vicious status quo, and permit to make a second referendum (as requested by Scotland, Northern Ireland and Labours) or a new general election. Indeed, the possibility of these two new votes require an extension of the deadline, because it is impossible to do them before the end of March. Although it is likely that the 27 Member States will unanimously agree to extending the deadline, it is important to note that the question of the European elections is a problem. Indeed, how can we avoid that the UK, if it is still a member of the Union, participates in the elections and sends elected representatives while the country is about to leave?\nSource: https://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2019/01/14/the-europeens-covered-to-a-report-of-brexit_5408759_3210.html This therefore pushes the third possibility to have the strongest likelihood, because maybe the EU will decide to leave the UK in its quagmire, in order to avoid a new parliamentary mess, this time at the European level. 60% - Neither of the above will occur and the UK will leave the EU\nDeal = 50%\nA large majority of parliamentarians are against a NO Deal, and they may be forced to pass the agreement even if it does not suit them. Due to the very certain impossibility of revocation, and the possibility that the EU decides not to extend the deadline, this possibility seems most likely.\nDespite the failure of the January 15 vote, the new February 27 vote seems crucial, and parliamentarians can not let the country's future completely derive from a No Deal. In one way or another, they will have to resign themselves to protect the country's future. No Deal = 10%\nIf the standoff continues, the catastrophic scenario does not seem impossible.

Therefore, leaving has 44% as an outside view. However, there has been a substantial public commitment to this outcome, possibly raising the stakes for May & co. This is also now the default option -- we leave if parliament remains tied up with in-fighting. We also have the option of taking the deal offered to us.

Since the European Court of Justice ruled that UK can unilaterally choose to remain in the EU, as a final outcome, I would have given a 15% chance of the UK revoking the deal. However, since the question is focused on what might happen from now to March 30, I see the revoke option as very unlikely. Unless extraordinary changes or a black swan in the English political environment happened (the reason why I maintained a 1% possibility), considering the course of events there is no time to activate such option. In fact, the UK in order to not undermine the stability of its common low creating a dangerous precedent could opt for revoking only after a new referendum (which, as a matter of fact, the \u201cremain\u201d would be likely to win). However, since with the conservative party is in power this will never happen (as Theresa May has reiterated more than once). This scenario would be possible (not certain) only after new elections, the labor party in power and with their willingness to call for a new Referendum. Hence, even though such a complex scenario might unfold in the coming months, there wouldn\u2019t be enough time to ask directly to revoke Article 50, the UK would have to ask for an extension and, only after that, start an internal discussion which might bring to a legitimization of a new referendum.  NO-DEAL: 29%. As the Tory minister Tobias Ellwood recently stated, \"There are many ministers, me being one of them, that need to see 'no deal' removed from the table,\". Furthermore, May sent a letter to each member of the parliament highlighting the need to find a solution to this impasse and also warning that \u201cthe history will judge us\u201d. Therefore, it is clear that (almost) nobody wants a hard Brexit (no deal) as an outcome. The same is true for the counterpart: the European Union. The interests at stake are too high for both sides.  As recently warned by the Bank of England, the UK economy could shrink by 8% in the immediate aftermath if there was no transition period. A dramatic scenario that, if true, could threaten directly the resilience and stability of all the major English institutions. On the other side, Europe wouldn\u2019t be able to guarantee the rights of millions of European citizens on British soil (besides all the economic consequence which UK would also face). However, a no-deal outcome cannot be completely downplayed since many other factors could play a role. Matters of proud and credibility could push aside the objectively dramatic drawbacks of a no deal option. The Labour party might bid on nationalism as a tool to gain new voters and then call for new elections. On the other side, also the European Union may refuse an extension of article 50 in order to give a strong message to the UK and all the European countries about the consequences of leaving the EU. However, considering the consequences of a no deal, I consider this evidence possible but unlikely.  EXTENDED: 70%. For the reason expressed above, I consider an extension of article 50 before March 31 as the most likely scenario. As said, a no-deal would lead to consequences that are above the tolerance level for both parts. Furthermore, the UK's main opposition party, the Labours, wants to force a general election and, after winning it, go back to Brussels to negotiate its version of Brexit. On the other side, the EU might agree to extend Article 50 if its leaders thought it would help smooth the process or if there was a chance the UK could end up staying in, possibly through another referendum. Finally, even in the case of a no deal, some government ministers have already publically talked about asking the EU for an extension of a few weeks to get all the necessary legislation through Parliament.

Its difficult to grasp the logic of that. She had a deal agreed with the EU (a Withdrawal Agreement) that she could not get through parliament, but she herself voted against her deal in an amendment telling her to go to the EU and get the Backstop changed. The EU say its not going to change what has been agreed. So what exactly does Mrs May want parliament to vote for? (a) the deal she agreement with the EU? But she agreed with parliament that the deal was not acceptable and voted to have it amended. So why would anyone want to vote for a deal even Mrs May says is not good enough? (b) an emended deal that excludes the Backstop? The problem with that is that the EU shows not sign of agreeing to it, so why would parliament vote for it?  The threat is that if parliament does not do what Mrs May says and agree something (no matter than few people actually want it) with the EU before 30th March, the UK will Leave the EU with No Deal on 29th March. Either Mrs May is the hardest PM of modern times or stupid or ignorant of what would happen with No Deal. I will give just one example of why No Deal would be a disaster. Currently the millions of UK Citizens who live in EU countries benefit from the EEA reciprocal healthcare scheme, by which they can get treatment provided in the EU country where they live and the UK reimburses the hospital that provides it. In December these UK citizens were informed that the UK will no longer reimburse these medical bills in the case of No Deal and that these UK citizens will need to make their own private arrangements. As many of these people are retired and have pre-existing long term medical problems they will not be able to afford private insurance. So in the event of No Deal expect to read about these old folks either dying of worry, dying because they have not been treated, or being evacuated back to the UK NHS (or the UK scrambling to reinstate the current arrangement).

Only two things were passed. \nOne made it a bit clearer that parliament is against a \"No Deal\" Brexit. The size of majority for this is a bit misleading because of all the ministers who don't want No Deal could not vote for it this time,  If a similar vote comes back in two weeks it would be likely to get a lot more support.\nThe other thing that was passed instructed May to go back to the EU and negotiate for \"some other arrangement\" to replace the Irish Backstop. The EU has said it will not renegotiate, the UK parliament says it will not pass May's Deal unless it does. If  both sides refuse to move the default was supposed to  be that the UK would leave on 29th March with No Deal, but if parliament has ruled that out where does that get us? I am not claiming I have the answers, but here are some thoughts. If the EU does agree to renegotiate then surely under the EU mantra \"nothing is agreed until everything is agreed\" then the current May Deal would cease to exist. So it would not just be a case of changing a word or two, it would be a case of opening up everything that had been agreed so far and staring again. As it has taken two and half years to get the May's Deal that has been rejected, it seems unlikely that a totally new deal would be negotiated and agreed by all parties in the EU, ready for Mrs May to present to the UK parliament to be voted on the 14th Feb (which is the timetable May has put forward.)  It could be argued that parliament is only asking for the Irish Backstop to be changed, so only a few words need changing. I don't think this is true. The backstop is needed to satisfy the Red Lines set by the UK (and EU). If I were the EU I would only offer to reopen negotiations to look for \"alternative arrangements\" in return for Mrs May removing her Red Lines. With no Red Lines a completely different Withdrawal Agreement becomes possible. But (obviously) a totally new WA would take a lot longer than two weeks to agree, in fact it would take longer than from now to the 29th March, so A50 would need to be extended.    How likely is it that the EU would agree to reopen just the Irish Backstop agreement? They have said \"no\", so would they change their mind? I think politically it would be very difficult, as the EU would need to be very careful how backing down would appear to EU voters. If the EU was perceived as throwing Ireland under the bus in order to avoid the inconvenience of a No Deal Brexit, to the economies of the bigger EU countries that trade a lot with the UK (e.g. Germany, France, Spain, Netherlands) it would send the message to the (economically) smaller EU countries that if push came to shove the rich, big EU countries would value their economic wellbeing over EU solidarity. Even if it was explained that Ireland was the country at the greatest risk from a No Deal Brexit, it would look like the EU was giving up the Irish Backstop to protect the big countries not to help Ireland. So I can't see the EU doing it, unless the UK dropped its Red Lines. If we assume I am completely wrong and the EU changes the Irish Backstop and Mrs May brings a new agreement back to parliament on (or around) the 13th Feb it is not over. The hardline ERG section of the Conservative Party have not said they will give unconditional support to any new deal. All they have said is that they will support May going back to the EU and negotiating \"an alternative\", so maybe they will not like the \"alternative\" or maybe they will find fault with some other aspect of what comes back.  But for the sake of argument lets assume a WA does get through parliament around the 14th Feb. Almost everyone who knows anything about getting the necessary legislation through parliament is now saying that there is not time to get it done between 14th Feb and 29th March. So my conclusion is that A50 will have to be extended, the only questions are; for how long? And for what reason? It is possible, but very improbable, unless the government gets even more screwed up, that by playing chicken the UK could leave it too late to get the EU to agree extending A50 and the only way to prevent Brexit without the legislation being in place would be to Revoke A50.  My guess is that Corbyn will now try to avoid the opposition being seen to  be the ones asking parliament to extend A50 (and so be blamed for delaying Brexit) and try and make May be the one who has asked to extend A50.  A factor in all this that is being ignored is the patience of the public. Most people are sick and tired of Brexit. So the question is who they blame the most for the mess. If voters start abandoning their support for a specific political party then the politicians will stop trying to paper over the cracks, buy trying to pretend to be all things to to all men, and will move toward a Brexit destination.

May's so-called plan B was approved by a majority of members of parliament, with some amendments. And it's these amendments which have put flesh on the bones of that plan.\nIn short, Parliament has told us that it favors sending May back to Brussels to seek concessions on the Northern Ireland backstop. That's the part of the Withdrawal Agreement which aims to prevent the return of border infrastructure between the Republic of Ireland, which will remain in the EU, and Northern Ireland, which will leave with the UK. This has been the single most contentious issue in the ranks of Theresa May's Conservative Party.\nIn theory, Parliament also ruled out a no-deal Brexit. But it failed to pass any amendment that would have achieved that aim, such as commanding the government to request an extension to the March 29 Brexit deadline, in the event it couldn't pass a deal by the end of February. After two years of this nonsense, it's nothing short of remarkable that the people elected to represent the citizens of the UK still think that this is in their gift (Para. 1-3).\nBut there's a snag.\nThe EU has been consistent in saying that the Withdrawal Agreement is done, locked down, not up for renegotiation. It appears not to matter how many times EU officials, diplomatic sources or even May herself tells her rebels this, they seem to think someone is lying. But without the Withdrawal Agreement being reopened, the backstop cannot be changed (Para. 4).\nAnd if the government eventually decides it wants an extension to the Brexit deadline, that must be agreed by the European Council -- the body which comprises the leaders of each member state. It would need to be approved unanimously, meaning any country can veto and, as I'm sure you can see, 28 is a big number.\nUnless the UK is willing to concede that May's deal is dead, the EU is unlikely to give the UK more time to continue howling at the moon. As one European diplomatic source recently told me, the EU is loathe to redraft something which has taken 28 nations two years to negotiate in the hope of tweaking it with weeks to go (Para. 4-6). The threat also works for those mortified at the prospect of crashing out without a deal. The Article 50 process -- the official EU exit route -- is nearly over. Without a revocation of Article 50 -- the request of which is in the UK's gift, but is also a total headache -- the default is that the UK leaves the EU on March 29, with or without a deal.

Is it really true that as people get older their political views tend to become more conservative and further toward the right side of the political spectrum? \nOr is this a myth? A few days ago we passed the date when, according to experts, the demographic turnover (coming of voting age and deaths) would have shifted the balance of the Brexit Referendum from the majority for Leave in June 2016 to a majority for Remain. This shift was based on the fact that Leave was a lot more popular among the over 65 year old voters than the under 25 year old voters, who were very strongly Remain supporters. In the two and half years since it was assumed that a lot more Leave voters had died than Remain voters, and a lot more young new voters would support Remain.  This crossover point was mentioned in political debates on TV, but was countered by the assertion that as people grow older their political views change i.e. the people who voted like 57 year olds in 2016 would vote like 60 year olds now, so in fact the passage of time since the referendum and the turnover of the voters would give the same outcome because the individuals would have changed their opinion as they got older.  So do people really become more conservative and right wing as they get older? Or does it only appear that they do, and that people's political views are more or less static and they only appear to have become more conservative or right wing because the average position of society has moved in the opposite direction?    For example society's view of gay rights, womens rights, universal healthcare, environmental protection, consumer rights, rates of taxation, paying for education etc have changed hugely over the last 50 years. So a 20 year old voter, 50 years ago who held views that were close to the left/right centre at that time, if they had kept the same views until now would be classed as an fairly extreme right wing conservative. So it would appear true that the voter had become more conservative and right wing, while it also being true that the voter had not changed their view at all, because it was society as a whole that had moved.  I am sure that some good quality study knows the answer, but I have not seen it, So is there evidence that on average people's politics move toward the right as they age, or do the people's views stay more or less fixed? Or is it more like sailing a boat that is moving through the water while the water is itself moving over the ground? So the person moves either to the left or right and at the same time society changes, so they can move left but finish up further right or vice versa.  So my question for any forecaster who has the answer is; is received wisdom correct that people become more conservative as they age? Something to chew on is that if older people are more conservative, and if conservative means \"adverse to change\", how is it that conservatives are identified  with Trump support in the US and Brexit support in the UK? When these seem to be examples of older so-called conservatives actually wanting radical changes (albeit to return to the past)?"], [64041, "2019-01-23T10:11:02Z", [0.08, 0.64, 0.28], ""], [1639, "2019-01-23T07:02:56Z", [0.05, 0.9, 0.05], "1.

That would essentially invalidate the referendum that created BREXIT in the first place.  In order to revoke Article 50, they'd have to take another referendum or risk a constitutional crisis, and a second referendum does not guarantee a different outcome. An extension seems the most likely outcome.  However, it isn't as straightforward as it appears.  All 27 EU member countries have to agree to an extension, and the EU has elections scheduled in May.  Prior to the elections, the EU Parliament's BREXIT Steering Group will disband as new members are elected.  Unless Theresa May can come up with a viable \"Plan B\" (after her Plan A decisive failure and just-survived vote of no confidence last week) on short notice, an extension will be hard to come by.  The Guardian's editorial board suspects May is trying to \"run down the clock\" as she did in late 2018.  I suspect an 11th hour extension is the most likely scenario, but a lot has to fall into place to make it happen. The UK leaving the EU with no plan in place would prove disastrous for the economies of Europe, and the UK in particular.

I agree that Mrs May might be very reluctant to admit defeat and ask for an A50 extension, but she has plenty of form of changing her mind and doing things she previously said were not going to happen.  As to getting all 27 other EU countries to unanimously agree to some thing there is evidence that they are likely to agree an extension.

The UK Withdrawal Agreement has been accepted by all 27 other EU countries. While some countries might want to be difficult (and many might be irritated by the UK during Brexit) it would seem very unlikely that any country would make more than a token show of irritation. After all no country would lose anything by agreeing to extend A50 and lots of other EU countries would lose if the UK left the EU with a No Deal Brexit.

I could use the current market predictions for the computation: a=3% and b=97%.  But I will forecast 100% for the No vote.  Therefore a=0% and b=100%.  If you use a value other than a=0%, you can update the rest of your probability using a=0 (assuming that it is the outcome). After the first vote, there is still time of more maneuvering.  A No-vote does not immediately lead to a no-deal Brexit.  May will definitely ask EU to provide assurance for the Irish backstop, and therefore c=0%, d=100%.   There are reports saying that EU is willing to provide the assurance after the first UK Parliament vote.  I put 75% probability for Yes (e) and 25% for No (f).  With assurance from EU, May will definitely ask for a second parliamentary note.  I put an even chance for passing the second parliamentary vote : g=50% and h=50%. If EU does not provide assurance or a No-vote for the second parliament vote, UK will definitely ask for a Brexit time extension.  We have to sum the two probabilities (for a time extension request) at this point. Right now, I put the probability of a time extension request to be 60 for Yes (i) and 40 or No (j).  If such an extension is not given, UK will exit with no-deal.  If there is an extension, there will be a potential second referendum and/or a general election. (To make it easier to do the computation, I am listing the values that I used:\na=0%, b=100;   c=0%, d=100%;   e=75%, f=25%;   g=50%, h=50%;   i=60%, j=40%) \u201cBefore 30 March 2019, what will happen next with regard to the UK's notification of Article 50?\u201d \n Using the probabilities shown above:\n\tUK exit (there are 4 paths including May-Brexit and no-deal Brexit) \n                    = a + b*c + b*d*e*g + (b*d*f + b*d*e*h)*j  \n                    = 0 + 0 + 0.375 + (0.25+0.375)*0.4\n                    = 63%\n\tRevoked by UK = 0%\n\tExtended by UK and EU \n                    =100-63 = 37%\n                   (One can also calculate this probability using (b*d*f + b*d*e*h) *i, leading to the same 37%).

This would be the case even with a looming disorderly Brexit.   The unknown factor that gave me pause before revising this down is what the Government will do in the event of the Withdrawal Agreement failing to pass Parliament after multiple attempts - obviously the current position is a pre-vote posture and it remains to be seen how the Cabinet and PM would react.    Apart from extreme circumstances then it is hard to see how a revocation could be countenanced without a further referendum, for which there is no longer any time. The legal default is that the UK will Brexit at the end of March, whether or not a deal is agreed.   This remains the case even while all factions in Parliament now see it as in their interest to run down the clock.  For this reason, I still see it as by far the most likely outcome. (51% up to 61%) The only way for this to be averted is for Parliament to positively legislate for an alternate course, and (crucially) for this to also be agreed by the EU centrally and among the 27 member states.  I haven't seen much evidence yet that Parliament as a whole is ready to stop indulging its existential crisis, and suspect that their is quite a bit more mileage in their temporising on this issue.   Even if a new course were to be agreed by Parliament, a unilateral agreement from the UK's side would take time to ratify all around, so an extension would be necessary and (if it were a purely a case of implementation, and not just damage-limitation) then the EU's agreement would probably be forthcoming - however it is not yet clear whether there will even be enough time for an extension to be agreed in order for an alternative to be given time.   In many ways a non-commital decision to try to renegotiate would be the most inconclusive and tricky result, as it is not even clear that the EU would accept a return to the negotiating table, whatever their regrets about the consequences that would follow from a disorderly exit (this is why at this point I don't want to overrate the probability of an extension). Events will move rapidly particularly as we reach mid-January (late January is realistically the latest that a deal can be passed in Parliament to be ratified by the EU27 in time for March) when a number of the key contours will start shaping up and timing will be key over how the each probability will shift.   The use by all sides of the \"timing out\" to build pressure may potentially create a situation where the only way out of an impasse is to create more time, so I have boosted the probability of an extension (21% up to 38%), although still struggle to see the precise conditions that would allow this to happen, especially as it must be agreed by so many parties."], [41922, "2019-01-10T15:51:01Z", [0.0, 0.4, 0.6], ""], [41922, "2019-01-10T15:49:52Z", [0.0, 0.65, 0.35], ""], [19636, "2019-01-10T14:30:21Z", [0.4, 0.2, 0.4], "I think that the EC has little incentive to grant the UK an extension.

As there are probably only between 20 to 50 of them I can't see how they would be able to get Parliament put itself in that position.

Remainers on the other hand are not keen on revoking A50 without first obtaining an electoral mandate (either via a referendum or general election) to Remain in the EU. So Remainers and many Leavers are now keen to get voters to provide a legitimate exit from Brexit. This is very unlikely to be possible before 30th Mar, which means extending A50 is almost certain. \nDominic Grieve MP has pointed out that even if May's Deal goes gets approved by Parliament there is probably insufficient time to get all the legislation passed by 30th Mar and that delay might well be needed, and if May's Deal does not get through parliament more time would be needed to avoid No Deal and time would be needed in case a new referendum is needed. \nCross party talks have been taking place for several weeks to endure that No Deal does not happen. \nhttps://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/29/cross-party-stop-the-clock-hard-brexit-no-deal-29-march "], [745, "2018-12-30T15:12:57Z", [0.07, 0.61, 0.32], ""], [63852, "2018-12-30T14:40:11Z", [0.05, 0.15, 0.8], ""], [1333, "2018-12-30T10:22:07Z", [0.0, 0.37, 0.63], ""], [29646, "2018-12-30T05:47:30Z", [0.0, 0.45, 0.55], "(1) A conservative government is not going to go back on a referendum favored by so many conservative voters.

The four groups being; Hard Brexiteer (Conservatives), Hard Remain (Conservatives), Conservatives who are not happy that the \"deal\" contains no legally blinding framework for a Future Trade Deal (its only a Withdrawal Agreement), and the DUP. It  seems very unlikely that the government would get sufficient opposition MPs to vote for May's Deal to get it passed. \nIts extremely unlikely that  the parliament would allow the UK to just fall out of the EU with No Deal.\nTherefore that leaves the possibilities of stopping Brexit by revoking A50 or extending it. Revoking A50 is technically the  easiest option because it does not require the EU to agree to it, it just needs the UK parliament to vote to Revoke. However Revoking A50 is politically much more difficult without parliament giving itself political cover by getting the UK public to agree by having a general election or referendum.\nThere is not sufficient time to have a referendum between now and 29th March, (it has been calculated that a referendum would take a minimum of 22 weeks) and even if there was time to hold the actual referendum some time after the referendum and before 29th March would be required to take any actions that were necessary after the result was known (if the result of a referendum was that the Brexit process should continue but not with May's Deal then A50 would need to be extended to allow for more negotiations.) \nIts possible that a General Election could take place, but assuming that it did, it almost certain that the Prime Minister would either be May or Corbyn. If it were May then nothing much would have changed. If it were Corbyn and he wanted to negotiate a different Brexit deal there would not be time to do it before 29th March (assume no General Election could be called before the second half of January, which would give Corbyn about 4 weeks to negotiate a deal with the EU and get it approved. That seems almost impossible.  The only possible deal I could see being done in that time would be to take May's Withdrawal Agreement, remove the Irish Backstop and replace it with a legally enforceable agreement that the UK will remain in the EEA and the Customs Union and will continue to contribute and obey EU rules and ECJ (i.e Norway+ Brexit).  \nSo extending A50 is by far the likely outcome.\nMy interpretation of MPs comments and polling results (particularly the recent YouGov polls as interpreted by Peter Kellner) is that many Leave voters and most Brexit supporting MPs are losing confidence that any Brexit that resembles the version promised before the June 2016 referendum will ever be possible. Brexit was sold as having cake (a frictionless trade relationship with the EU) and eating it (being able to do FTAs with 3rd countries, without allowing EU citizen Freedom of Movement, without paying subs to the EU, and without having to follow the ECJ rulings). After two and half years of the EU telling the UK that to have frictionless trade you have to be a member of the EU (or EEA+ Single Market), which requires that you abide by EU rules including the Four Freedoms, pay contributions and follow rulling of the ECJ, even the Brexiteers are starting to realise the EU is not kidding. And most of the Brexiteers know full well that without frictionless trade much of the UK's manufacturing industry (the part that depends on trans-European supply chains) would migrate into the remaining EA (that's a much bigger market than the UK).  While the Brexiteers favorite economist says that losing manufacturing is not a problem and that the UK could adjust, the Brexiteers are wondering how long it would take for this adjustment to happen (towns that lost their heavy manufacturing in the 1980s are still depressed now) and how the Leave voters will feel when they lose their jobs and are told to adjust. Leave voters are, I think, seeing that Brexit might be a great idea and a poke in the eye to the liberal elite, but the people that are likely be worse off are the left behind in the industrial towns, and maybe the elite (in the shape of the toffs who told them to vote Leave) have screwed them again.\nNo one wants to admit they were wrong, so I think the Leave voters and the Brexiteer MPs are desperately hoping that someone else will stop Brexit, so they don't have have admit they were wrong voting to Leave. If someone else stops Brexit then the Brexiteers (and Leave voters) will be able to say that Brexit would have been a wonderful thing if only traitors had not stopped them getting the deal they imagined.

For example in an interview with Sky today he said \"My proposal at this moment is that we go forward, trying to get a customs union with the EU, in which we would be able to be proper trading partners.\" [1]. The only chance that 'revoke' happens in the time frame is if the EU by refusing to extend Article 50, force the UK to choose between Brexit and cancelling Brexit. Although they might do that at some point if we keep asking to extend again and again, it would be political suicide for them to refuse the first time we ask, especially as Article 50 explicitly says that it can be done, as long as the other member states agree.

(As a Brexiter myself, this is quite an attractive option because being forced by the EU to choose would further strengthen anti-EU feelings not just in the UK but across Europe.) EXTEND\nTheresa May will almost certainly lose the \"meaningful vote\" in January which will almost certainly lead to Brexit being extended. Some in the media are saying it's impossible for her to win that vote but I think she does have a slim chance. Although there's zero chance of the DUP voting yes (from their perspective, the unknown is preferable to a guaranteed disaster) and zero chance of the SNP voting yes, some Tory MPs will support her because of loyalty to their party or because they are scared of possible alternatives, and a handful of Labour MPs could also vote yes. But on the whole, DUP + SNP + LibDem + Labour + Tory hard Brexiters will almost certainly be a bigger number than Loyal / Scared / Pragmatic Tories + Labour rebels.\nIf, as looks likely, she loses, her deal is finally dead and buried, and then all hell breaks loose (again). We will have to start looking at alternatives, but the country has not done the necessary preparation to leave with no deal, there's not enough time to cobble together an alternative deal, and there still probably won't be enough support for revoking Brexit (but more than at the moment). So the only pragmatic solution is to extend. NEITHER / LEAVE\nThis bucket covers three possibilities, all of which are unlikely;\n\u2022 Leave with Theresa May's deal: In the unlikely event that she gets her deal through parliament, we will probably leave the EU on that basis.\n\u2022 Leave with another deal hurriedly put together: I don't see how Theresa May could do this herself given how tightly bound politically she is to her deal, and there isn't enough time for a new leader to be chosen then a new deal negotiated.\n\u2022 Leave with no deal: I don't think Theresa May has the guts carry out her threat to do this, it would have to be someone else, and leaving with no deal would require preparation, which hasn't been done and there isn't time to do."], [63757, "2018-12-21T10:25:42Z", [0.03, 0.44, 0.53], ""], [41922, "2018-12-21T09:36:18Z", [0.02, 0.18, 0.8], ""], [1333, "2018-12-21T08:59:04Z", [0.1, 0.15, 0.75], ""], [1389, "2018-12-21T08:39:31Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""]], "open_date": "2018-12-21T08:00:38Z", "close_date": "2019-03-30T06:59:38Z"}
