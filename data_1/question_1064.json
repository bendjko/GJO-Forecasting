Instead, it\u2019s currently thousands of miles away in Venezuela where, under contract for the Russian state-oil giant Rosneft Oil Co PJSC, it loaded 2 million barrels of oil, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and shipping reports. How\u2019s that possible? Because the ship\u2019s transponders were turned off before it slipped into Venezuelan waters, the data shows. The practice of oil tankers turning off their location signals has increased in the past month, according to shipping data, after the U.S. went after a Chinese-owned shipping company it said was moving crude for sanctioned Iran. The U.S. is seeking to squeeze the Nicolas Maduro government in Venezuela by starving it of oil revenue. But more and more tankers appear to be using the technique to avoid penalties, helping give a boost to Venezuelan crude output that has plummeted since the U.S. imposed sanctions. Venezuela loaded 10.86 million barrels of crude oil in the first 11 days of November, more than double the volume in the same period last month. About half of those barrels were loaded onto ships that had turned off their transponders, which later delivered cargoes to China and India, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\nhttps://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/venezuela-is-secretly-exporting-millions-of-barrels-of-oil-1.1348001 In terms of recent shipments and their destination, data by IHS Markit Commodities at Sea suggests that activity observed so far this month (excluding ships not sending any signals) has declined further, with liftings not surpassing 400,000 b/d. India and China continue absorbing most of these volumes, with a marginal increase to report on flows to Europe (if currently reported destination proves accurate). It is mainly Spain importing once again small cargoes from Venezuela.\nhttps://ihsmarkit.com/research-analysis/crude-oil-trade-another-exemption-for-chevron-in-venezuela.html Murica's puppet Gullible Guaido has failed.

After reading about the situation in Venezuela, the point is that Maduro still has all he needs for keeping himself in power. Right now the deal seems to be exporting gold, and it's unlikely that this will change in the next two to three months. I use this to justify that him staying in power for so long is not mere chance, but the most probable outcome (80% of more). Guaido has been acting president for about nine months. If I assume a fixed probability \"x\" of Maduro ceasing to be president for each month, then I notice that (1-x)^9 ~ 0.8 for x = 0.025 (or 2.5% per month). So if Maduro being still president of Venezuela is the expected outcome from the fact that he keeps control of the army (and his parallel police and intelligence offices), he keeps getting money from drug trafficking and exporting gold and he still has the support of Cuba, Turkey, China and Russia, then at most his probability of not holding to power is 2.5% per month.

Guaido told the media that he offered to step down if Maduro did the same, creating the potential for a transition government that included military representation. By making the offer public, Guaido extended an olive branch to the military and demonstrated that they may be able to get a better deal with Maduro out of power.  Maduro\u2019s FARC troubles: Maduro appears to be flustered by the ongoing narrative regarding the ELN and FARC presence in Venezuela and the recent acceleration of the debate over the implementation of the Rio Treaty (TIAR). Maduro\u2019s concerns about being blamed for harboring terrorists add to the significant impact sanctions are having on his stability. Maduro tried to distract with an over-the-top response of military exercises near the border. He tried to change the subject by pointing to two photos of Guaido with Rastrojos leaders who were also taking refuge in Venezuela. Neither of those moves appear to have changed to focus for the hemisphere, which will discuss the issue under the framework of the TIAR next week. False negotiations: Maduro\u2019s reopening negotiations with a small branch of the opposition who disagree with Guaido\u2019s strategy and the recent release of political prisoners appear aimed to gain his side some good will going into the UN General Assembly meetings. However, sources told Hxagon that Maduro\u2019s move to open negotiations with a false opposition branch may have done more to divide his own coalition than Guaido\u2019s. Diosdado Cabello is unhappy with the new negotiation process because he views it as eventually limiting the power of the National Constituent Assembly (ANC) that he runs. Elements within the military view the false negotiation as a waste of time failing to address the key stability issues the country faces. From inside the regime, the big winners in this false negotiation process appear to be the Rodriguez siblings, with Vice President Delcy Rodriguez and Minister of Information Jorge Rodriguez being the public faces of the new process. The fight over the National Assembly: The negotiations with small parties are a concern for Guaido as the PSUV has said they will rejoin the National Assembly (AN). There is a possibility that the government will attempt to toss out Guaido from within. While Guaido\u2019s coalition has a large majority of the seats and recently voted to renew Guaido\u2019s mandate, a number of the legislators are in exile due to threats by the Maduro regime. Additional threats or arrests combined with political trickery could complicate the legal situation for Guaido as president of the AN. Venezuela is in a situation where power politics matters more than the bureaucratic institutional details. That said, both Maduro and Guaido make significant efforts to demonstrate that they care about the details as part of their effort to build and maintain legitimacy amid their fight over the leadership of the country. Even if Maduro somehow manipulates the National Assembly into a vote that tosses Guaido, it is near certain Guaido will reject the move as undemocratic. At that point, the international community\u2019s commitment to the de jure government under Guaido will be tested. We will likely see a preview of that fight in the coming week at UNGA and the TIAR discussions. Saudi oil attacks: With declining production and an inability to export due to sanctions, Maduro is not in a position to take advantage of any increased prices to obtain more cash for his struggling regime. To the contrary, Reuters reported this week that PDVSA will soon need to shut down production at additional fields due to a lack of storage capacity. However, he does have two potential longer term benefits if global supplies remain tight and prices remain higher in the coming weeks. First, any increased US focus on Iran will likely decrease the focus on Venezuela. Second, China may rethink its growing restrictions on Venezuelan oil imports in a tighter global market, especially if they believe the US is less likely to enforce sanctions amid the price spike. Venezuela - Spain\u2019s ABC reported that Mexican cartels smuggled large amounts of US currency in CLAP boxes to Costa Rica, where the money was then sent via bank transfer to Russia to pay off top drug traffickers including Tareck al-Aissami and Diosdado Cabello. Costa Rican media had previously reported that the Alunasa aluminum company had been shut down in Costa Rica due to a money laundering investigation, but the cartel bulk cash smuggling was a new angle. Meanwhile, the US Department of Treasury continued to sanction the Saab corruption network that made money by overcharging for CLAP boxes."], [691, "2019-09-19T13:57:59Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [41922, "2019-09-18T23:15:50Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [62737, "2019-09-18T23:04:09Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.98], "Time."], [1034, "2019-09-18T20:56:13Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [1333, "2019-09-18T20:25:32Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.9], ""], [29907, "2019-09-18T20:21:55Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.98], ""], [76730, "2019-09-18T18:28:45Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [40848, "2019-09-18T14:22:09Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.98], ""], [31756, "2019-09-18T05:29:00Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [176, "2019-09-18T00:52:45Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "It looks like Venezuela is pretty well screwed. \nChina and Russia are sewing up whatever oil and gas fields and accompanying infrastructure that they can in Iran and Iraq, as Iraq tries to markedly up the pace of development on the fields it shares with Iran.

India has also significantly increased oil imports from Venezuela. According to recent industry data, crude shipments from the Latin American country surged to 475, 200 bpd, a 21-month high. This figure constitutes a 100% increase from the previous month and a 50% increase from the same period last year. Notably, U.S. sanctions have also been imposed on major parts of Venezuela\u2019s energy sector, specifically state-owned Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA) in an effort to mount pressure on the country\u2019s embattled leader, Nicolas Maduro. Despite American assertions to the contrary, private Indian refiners have continued to import oil from the country, including both Reliance Industries and Nayara Energy. Both firms struck deals to purchase crude from PDVSA well before it became subject to the U.S. sanctions. Reliance\u2019s reported 15-year deal, beginning in 2012, allows it to buy up to 400,000 bpd. \"Risk-averse companies have preferred to avoid the risk of retaliation by the Trump Administration by eschewing business with Venezuela's collapsing oil industry altogether, Reliance, and Indian energy more generally, have resisted considerably U.S. pressure and remain engaged,\" says Daniel Lansberg-Rodriguez, a Latin America expert at Northwestern's Kellog School of Management. The Indian government has reportedly directed at least one of the refiners to devise a payment mechanism that would avoid the U.S. banking system in an effort to avoid exposure to American secondary sanctions. Indian refiners had established a rupee-based barter system to pay for Iranian crude oil several years ago when paying in dollars was no longer an option. A similar arrangement effectively aimed at bypassing U.S. sanctions is likely once again under consideration in the Venezuelan case.

While the rally on 23 July was far from the largest of the year, several of the preliminary rallies outside Caracas drew substantial crowds and demonstrated that Guaido retains significant support among the public. Negotiations - Plenty of rumors and very little real news have come from the negotiations in Barbados. Both sides are avoiding discussing the details publicly. Multiple sources have suggested that the conditions for early elections remain a key topic, but no details have been confirmed other than the fact the two sides remain far apart on key issues including whether Maduro will remain president in the run-up to those early elections. Airspace dispute - One of the Venezuelan military's SU-30s approached a US EP-3 in the waters north of Venezuela this weekend. Venezuela claims the US entered its territory and the plane was escorted out. The US claims the EP-3 was in international airspace and the Venezuelan plane conducted an unsafe close approach that put everyone at risk. The fact Venezuela had an operational SU-30 demonstrates Russia\u2019s continued military support for Maduro. Blackouts - The country experienced its fourth nationwide blackout of the year. Power was restored in most of the capital by the following morning. Though the nationwide blackouts get attention, the situation has been regularly problematic outside the capital, with some municipalities in western Venezuela going days without power at a time.  Lima Group - The Lima Group called on the UN Security Council to debate the situation in Venezuela and sent the Bachelet report on the human rights situation to the International Criminal Court. The Lima Group also promised to support efforts to investigate corruption and organized crime in Venezuela including Maduro\u2019s ties to the ELN.

Juan Guaido and Nicolas Maduro are sending representatives to meet in Barbados for a third round of negotiations under Norway\u2019s mediation efforts. The teams representing Maduro, Guaido and the international community all believe new elections are needed, but vast differences remains regarding the terms of those elections.  \"The top sticking point is the status of Nicolas Maduro. Guaido\u2019s team demands Maduro leave before elections, though there are some reports that they may be willing to be flexible on that demand if other demands for a new electoral council and new elections are met with international verification of the process. Maduro insists he will remain president and his strongest supporters (not on the negotiating team) say new elections are not even an option. Some of the Chavistas on Maduro\u2019s side are maneuvering and floating options for Maduro to leave power in various ways, but those efforts are not well coordinated among the various civilian and military powerbrokers. A previous attempt last month to gently transition Maduro out of power in favor of another Chavista was shut down by Maduro as soon as he received word of it. \"Human rights concerns. Maduro and his allies were caught off guard by the very tough and detailed report out of Michelle Bachelet\u2019s UN human rights office. The report described massive human rights violations including thousands of extrajudicial executions that had been covered up by authorities. The combination of content and authorship ensured this report has more impact than the many other reports written with human rights concerns. This report from the UN will help Latin American and European governments continue to justify tough measures against Maduro. \"New military commanders. After a delayed military leadership shuffle, Vladimir Padrino Lopez remains the minister of defense. The fact Maduro did not or could not replace Padrino Lopez highlights the minister\u2019s role as one of the most powerful men in the country.  \"The other top official to remain in power is Ivan Hernandez Dala, the head of military counterintelligence (DGCIM). There remains significant tension among the Armed Forces branches over the fact Hernandez Dala remains in his position after the controversial torture and death of a naval officer. This past week, the US sanctioned DGCIM for its role in repression. \"General Alexis Rodriguez Cabello was named head of the Army. He is Diosdado Cabello\u2019s cousin and the general perception (to the extent people can read the early tea leaves) is that he is there to balance Padrino Lopez and prevent him from conspiring against Diosdado. \"Over the past seven months, Padrino Lopez coordinated the heads of the services to unify the military\u2019s response to Guaido and the crisis in general. His key goal was to retain military unity and avoid any scenario in which parts of the security forces were fighting each other. Padrino Lopez\u2019s first job now is to make sure Rodriguez Cabello at the Army and General Fabio Enrique Zavarce Pabon of the National Guard commit to his unwritten unity pact among the military leadership. \"Interestingly, General Suarez Chourio, the previous commander of the Army and someone with a strong personal following among the troops, was not forced to retire and was instead shuffled into another top military spot (jefe de Estado Mayor de la Comandancia en Jefe). It\u2019s a sign that there are too many top military officials to manage.  \"Food crisis. Multiple foreign media highlighted the growing food crisis in Venezuela.

The Maduro regime rarely responds to these sorts of incidents quickly unless they believe them to be a real threat to their stability or reputation. \"Reuters published an in-depth report on why the military remains loyal to Maduro, highlighting the long term efforts by the Chavistas to corrupt the top ranks and purge dissent. Fear of detention and repression has been used selectively to keep the military in line in recent years, but this very public death appeared to cross a line.\nGuaido has called for a significant size protest on 5 July against DGCIM.

Late last week, at least six military officers were detained including an Air Force general. Sources suggest at least some of the six had been in contact with each other, which alarmed Maduro\u2019s counter-intelligence advisors. There were no immediate indications that the officers detained were disobeying orders or putting together a potential plot. The detentions show a general nervousness by Maduro and the circle of advisors around him about any hints of a plot that could involve the military. \"Military promotions. The new round of military promotions has caused anxiety among officers who feel they are not getting their opportunity to serve in key posts because current officials are remaining in the military for too long. At lower levels, Army, Air Force and National Guard colonels as well as Navy captains are grumbling that they are not getting their shots at becoming generals and admirals because the top ranks are way too full. Venezuela has among the highest number in the world of generals/admirals as a proportion of total military personnel. \"Who will be the new minister of defense? The largest military promotion controversy will reshape the dynamics of the circle of power around Maduro. Vladimir Padrino Lopez has spent a long time as minister and had his commission extended multiple times in spite of his age. It\u2019s widely acknowledged among the military and civilian leaders in Maduro\u2019s circle that it\u2019s time for a change, particularly after the minister\u2019s questionable role in the events of 30 April. There will be political waves if and when Maduro attempts to replace Padrino Lopez, one of the top five powerbrokers in the country and a critical figure in maintaining military unity during the past six months of political tension. However, if Padrino Lopez is not replaced, it could cause some who are in line for promotions to complain and conspire. \"Escapes and Defections. Ivan Simonovis, a high profile political prisoner, posted a picture of himself in Washington DC with the news that he was free and out of Venezuela. Simonovis reportedly escaped his house arrest and fled the country following the events of 30 April. Also in Washington, the Washington Post published a lengthy interview with General Figuera, the former head of SEBIN who helped Guaido on 30 April and then escaped the country. \"Oil and Finances. New data confirmed previous reporting that oil imports by India dropped last month. That is important as a portion of India\u2019s oil imports provided new money to the Maduro government\u2019s cash flow. Additionally, China\u2019s imports of Venezuelan oil were at their lowest levels in five years. \"Sanctions. The US Department of Treasury issued new sanctions against two Venezuelans who took part in corruption related to the electricity sector. \"Russia. A Russian military plane was spotted in Caracas and Russia confirmed they have moved personnel to the country for maintenance and equipment repair. The very public move appeared to be an attempt by Russia to counter recent reports that they have been withdrawing personnel and financial support for Maduro. \"Region. The OAS General Assembly voted to recognize Guaido\u2019s representatives to the organization. This caused a number of countries to object.

I am frequently amazed when I read articles like this about things that nearly happened.  I think that the summary in the last paragraph is accurate. https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/02/opinion/venezuela-maduro-guaido.html?emc=edit_th_190503&nl=todaysheadlines&nlid=286991830503 A Treacherous Stalemate in Venezuela\nForeign meddling, coup plotting and bloody demonstrations heighten the tension. By The Editorial Board What the Venezuelan opposition boldly proclaimed on Tuesday as a \u201cfinal phase\u201d in the opposition\u2019s three-month campaign to oust the Venezuelan strongman, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, fizzled out by Wednesday, leaving behind murky claims of secret talks gone wrong, defectors who didn\u2019t defect and Russian and Cuban meddling. What comes next was even less clear than before. Announcing the final push on Tuesday morning, Juan Guaid\u00f3, the opposition leader whose claim to the Venezuelan presidency is recognized by the United States and more than 50 other countries, seemed certain that this time enough of the military would cross over to assure Mr. Maduro\u2019s ouster. Top members of the Trump administration \u2014 Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the national security adviser, John Bolton \u2014 promptly gave \u201cOperaci\u00f3n Libertad\u201d their enthusiastic support. Then on Wednesday, with only a handful of national guard troops on his side, Mr. Guaid\u00f3 acknowledged that it didn\u2019t happen. Only one top Maduro official, the head of the security services, Manuel Ricardo Cristopher Figuera, appeared to have defected to him, and mass demonstrations on Wednesday were forcefully put down by security forces still loyal to Mr. Maduro. An opposition leader who had been freed from house arrest by Mr. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s followers and initially appeared with him in public, Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, took refuge in the Spanish Embassy in Caracas with his wife and daughter. Then the finger-pointing broke out. Mr. Maduro blamed President Trump for what he called an attempted coup d\u2019\u00e9tat. Mr. Trump assailed Cuba, his usual whipping boy for Mr. Maduro\u2019s survival, though the C.I.A. has concluded that Havana\u2019s support is far less consequential than the administration claims. Mr. Pompeo claimed that the Russians had talked Mr. Maduro at the last moment out of boarding a plane and fleeing the country, and hinted at military intervention. The Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, warned Mr. Pompeo that \u201cthe continuation of aggressive steps is fraught with the most serious consequences.\u201d More dramatically, Mr. Bolton claimed that there had been a secret arrangement for three Venezuelan officials \u2014 the defense minister, the chief judge of the Venezuelan Supreme Court and the commander of the presidential guard \u2014 to switch to Mr. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s side, but that they failed to do so. The Wall Street Journal additionally reported that according to Elliott Abrams, the administration\u2019s special envoy for Venezuela, secret talks had taken place between the opposition and top government officials about a change in government and that a legal document had been drawn up for the transition. But whether the purported deal was a trap set by Mr. Maduro to make his opponents look inept, or whether the officials got cold feet, or whether it was an effort by American officials to spread distrust and instability in the beleaguered presidential palace, remained unclear. In the end, whatever had led Mr. Guaid\u00f3 and the Trump team to believe that the \u201cfinal phase\u201d was at hand, and whatever led to its collapse, the fact was that the opposition was left weaker than before in the eyes of its exhausted and impoverished followers. Mr. Guaid\u00f3 called next for national strikes, but it was difficult to know how long he could continue to rouse popular protests with promises of imminent change. And as Venezuela\u2019s humanitarian crisis grew more dire, Mr. Maduro was bound to blame it on American sanctions on Venezuelan oil, which came into full effect this week. None of that bodes well for a quick resolution of the crisis. At some point, Mr. Guaid\u00f3 may have to consider negotiating directly with Mr. Maduro to find a peaceful exit from a stalemate that is compounding the suffering that Mr. Maduro\u2019s policies, corruption and chronic mismanagement have inflicted on the Venezuelans. American military intervention, repeatedly cited as a possibility by Mr. Trump and Mr. Pompeo, remains a terrible idea. However invested the Trump administration is in the ouster of Mr. Maduro, a direct intervention would find little support across a region with bad memories of American meddling, and would brand Mr. Guaid\u00f3 as an American lackey."], [63825, "2019-06-22T09:04:21Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.61, 0.39, 0.0], ""], [73775, "2019-06-22T07:29:49Z", [0.0, 0.02, 0.18, 0.3, 0.5], ""], [38, "2019-06-22T02:51:01Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.11, 0.22, 0.67], "New reasons why Maduro's longevity may be limited:\n-Russia is cutting back on its financial support. \n-Maduro is reported to be selling gold at discount prices.\n-\"The following for his socialist regime has fallen four points since last year, to 19 percent; backing for the opposition has leapt from 27 to 40 percent.\" New reasons why Maduro's leadership may continue:\n\"Maduro has regained a few inches of political ground.

Guaid\u00f2 (the leading opposer) has been isolated by Maduro and his fellows have not reached and many of Maduro opponents have abandoned the country.\nThe international community is not giving anymore attention to the Venezuela situation, and the EU is simply pushing for a peaceful solution.\nMoreover, in the last days Maduro has signed an agreement with Huawei about improving 4G connection. This choice would have a twofold effect: linking even more Venezuela with Chine, a country that has always supported Maduro, and, above all, allows Maduro, in the long-term, to control even better the local communication networks.\nAccording to these facts (and the fact we are already at half June) I reshape drastically my forecast, predicting that Maduro won\u2019t cease to be President in the short-term. However, in case of big changes during the second half on 2019, I assess to 10% the probability of Maduro ceasing to be president between 1 october and 31 december. https://www.ilmattino.it/primopiano/esteri/usa_allarme_venezuela_patto_maduro_huawei_censurare_social-4554851.html\n"], [176, "2019-06-14T18:35:19Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.35, 0.35, 0.3], "Oil production: OPEC secondary sources suggest Venezuelan oil production in May was 741,000 barrels per day.

Moreover, the worst days of the crisis around Maduro are over, not at least because other incidents have taken precedence in international politics that require attention from the international community, therefore decreasing the factor of Maduro ceasing power due to international interference.  Beginning of June, moreover, Maduro said he would sign a deal with the IFRC to increase incoming humanitarian support to the country. This may at least lighten social tensions a little bit in some areas of the country. \nAs Maduro's main motive currently is to stay in power he will find political moves, such as the deal with the IFRC that would give him credit. Moreover, he expands the dependence of the most vulnerable, the poor, in Venezuela on him, as he did with introducing CLAP the food distribution system for the very poor.  It is clear that, legally or lawfully, Maduro will not cease to be President, as his party is firmly holding onto power in every state organ. Maduro, the Supreme Court, the National Electoral Council (CNE) and the Constitutional Assembly will continue to disqualify opponents from holding office, rig electoral rules to ensure success in any electoral contest and manipulate results after elections take place. As well, opponents to the regime are jailed and protests are met with tough military crackdowns, which may still be enough to dissuade the population from taking to the streets in large numbers. As internal anti-government protests are still up and running by government oppositions and a street movement by the opposition and other opponents seems to be the most likely way to push Maduro out of power, however capacities are not met it is not likely that Maduro will be pushed out of power anytime soon. The border between Venezuela and Colombia has recently re-opened, meaning that no major deterioration seems to be in sight, either. This moreover means that citizens unhappy with the situation also have the change to migrate out of the country, rather than planning an uprising against the oppressive regime, therefore making the opposition movement loose drivers of change. \nhttps://www.npr.org/2019/06/09/731070141/after-4-months-venezuelas-border-with-colombia-reopens\nhttps://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/01/venezuela-crisis-latest-updates-190123205835912.html Futhermore, the failed miltiary uprising in late April shows that there are no capabilities, as of yet, within the country to topple the Maduro regime successfully.

Another, challenge to his hold on power in Venezuela is the prospect of an uprising.  It has been suggested that two variables that are indicative of a high potential for uprising is a high number of youths (age 15-24) and, simultaneously, high levels of corruption. The underlying hypothesis is that in highly corrupt countries, growing inequality and investment stagnation will hit the younger population especially hard, as they are not yet established in the economic system, and hence have fewer economic opportunities. From this follow that in a society characterized by a large percentage of youths and a high level of corruption, the younger population will be important agents of change and the chance of a political uprising in this scenario is therefore higher.  A high percentage of youth in the population, a so-called youth bulge, is set at min 20 %. Data from the World Bank\u2019s show that in 2001 15-24 year old made up app. 19.3 % of the population. However, in recent years the age structure has been changing with an increase (proportionally and gross numbers) in Venezuela. In 2019, the World Bank data estimate that the youth make up app. 17% of the population. Hence, Venezuela does not have a pronouncedly large youth bulge. Moreover, it estimated that more than 4 million Venezuelans have left the country following the severe economic crisis and extreme food shortage. Reports say that 53% of people in the age of 15-29% wish to leave Venezuela. In terms of corruption, Venezuela rank extremely poorly according to Transparency International. Scoring just 18 out of 100 points, Venezuela is one of the most corrupt countries in the world.  While the current state economic crisis, and extreme corruption of state institutions, speak in favor of Maduro\u2019s loss of power, the out-flux of young people might be of significance for Maduro\u2019s ability to hold on to power. As youths are important actors of change, and key drivers of political uprising, the fact that they are increasingly leaving the country, could potentially impact the force of the public protests and the pressure from civil society against Maduro. Hence, I remain skeptical that Maduro will cease to be president in the near future.

It is presented as a huge embarrassment to Maduro. But with the same swagger it can be presented as a sign of confidence that Putin has in the Maduro's regime stability. I think neither of the above quite reflects the situation. Simplest explanation is that Venezuela does not have money to pay Russian specialists. And it is not that critical for them to be there. Yes, the regime is unstable and the economy shrunk. Unfortunately, it is not enough. Look at Cuba - for decades it endured America's pressure and blockade. As Venezuela, it was one of the richest in the region before Castro. As Venezuela, at the same time it had starkest contrasts between rich and poor. In Cuba, economy under Castro stagnated for decades and significantly shrunk when the Soviet Union withdrew its support.  Admittedly, there are big differences: in Cuba, the economy suffered less and the opposition was crushed after the military takeover. Not to mention that Fidel Castro was  a charismatic orator who could keep crowds fascinated for hours under burning sun. Maduro can't.  But he, Maduro, presents himself as a keeper of Chavez's fire, keeps popular subsidies for poor (admittedly they bankrupt the state). There is also the same scapegoat - the US that can be blamed for all misfortunes. And the opposition - mostly the middle class - is not that keen to pick up arms and go to die on the streets.

The research program has identified six variables that are indicative of the potential of regime overthrow. The variables are the following: \n1.\tThe time in which a leader has been in power (Longer leadership = higher risk of coup) \n2.\tThe time a regime has been in power (Younger regimes = higher risk of coup) \n3.\tWhen the last attempt at a coup was (Little time since last coup = high risk of a re-attempt) \n4.\tDefeat in election (Recent defeat = higher risk of coup) \n5.\tWeather conditions (Extreme weather that interfere with agriculture or market dynamics = increased risk of coup) \n6.\tGDPPC (Indicative of a ruling leader\u2019s ability to buy their opponent) \nI will attempt for the above parameters in relation to the current situation in Venezuela as a basis for my prediction on when Nicolas Maduro will cease to be president of Venezuela.   1.\tNicolas Maduro was elected president in 2013 and had been in office not a full term before elections were called in 2018. Hence, the length of this time in power does not count toward an increased risk of immediate coup. However, it is worth noticing that the experienced protests to his presidency already 1 year into his first term in 2014. (Low risk) 2.\tThe regime here is understood as Maduro\u2019s own political basis: The Socialist Party. The Socialist party is well-established haven enjoyed political prominence since its foundation in the late 1990s by Hugo Chavez. (Low risk) 3.\tThe last coup attempt in Venezuela was in 2002, against the late Hugo Chavez  initiated by high ranking members of the military. The coup kept Chavez out of office for less than 50 hours, and as such failed. (Low risk) 4.\tTechnically, Maduro has not lost a presidential election, and the Socialist Party has, in one form or another, been in power since the 1999. However, while Maduro did not lose in 2018, the election is at the heart of the Venezuelan conflict in that it was considered invalid, and declared so, by the National Assembly. (Medium risk) 5.\tVenezuela has not considered any abnormal downpour in recent time. (Low risk) 6.\tThe Venezuelan economy is in extreme crisis. Inflation is expected to reach 10 million % and the country is essentially experiencing a total breakdown in trade and consumption. The economy is in free fall and while that currently allows for the Maduro to pay his way to remain in power, the situation could quickly become so dire that this will no longer be an option. (High risk) This rudimentary analysis indicates that the economy is currently the only factor that indicates a pending coup in Venezuela, and therefore a high unlikelihood, of Maduro ceasing to be president of Venezuela. However, the model does not account for the tensions of the international political society, where nations actors like the US and EU have acknowledged Juan Guaido as President of Venezuela. Similarly, countries like Russia and Turkey have supported Maduro\u2019s claim to power. Also, while Maduro did not lose the election, his victory has been denied by the General Assembly and considering that a democratic election is only worth the legitimacy is can claim, this \u2018not-defeat\u2019 does not speak in his favor. Moreover, while the extreme weather has not interfered with food production, the economy is currently is such shambles that food shortage is a real and extremely serious issue in Venezuela. Hence, this lack of basic security does not count in Maduro\u2019s favor. While Maduro has been able to secure the support of the military, this ally to has wavered with some high-ranking officers expressing their support for Guaido. Additionally, through his reference to Venezuelan constitution, national support, international recognition and budding support from the military, Guaido has positioned himself as real and tangible alternative to Maduro.   In conclusion, following the first part of the analysis, it seems a coup is not in the immediate future. However, considering the many complicating factor\u2019s around the current situation in Venezuela, it does not seem likely that Maduro will stay in power throughout this presidential term. Considering the options above, I ascribe 88 % probability of Maduro not ceasing to be president till after January 1st 2020.

The crisis in Venezuela began in 2014, when Hugo Chavez was the president of Venezuela and the crisis has been affecting lives of citizens, making it miserable to reside in the country. However, despite internal and international pressure on Maduro, he\u2019s been the president of Venezuela since 2013 and I assume that he won\u2019t cease to be president of Venezuela before January 1 of 2020. Below I\u2019ll be discussing the major international and internal challenges for his presidency. International pressure is one of the most significant challenges for Maduro. Venezuela owns the world\u2019s largest supply of crude oil. Additionally, petroleum products are major part of the country\u2019s exports. However, oil output has been declining. In January 2019 the US government imposed sanctions on Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil company PDVSA. However, the company can avoid sanctions if they recognize Juan Guaido as a president. The sanctions left Venezuela\u2019s oil-dependent economy without its biggest source. Currently Venezuela is desperately looking for new buyers. Even though Venezuela now is exporting more oil to India, it\u2019s still not enough and 10 million barrels of oil have been sitting off in the tankers. Besides, the exports to China have been dropping as well and Asian market isn\u2019t that attractive to Venezuela, since it means increased transport costs, while the Venezuelan ports aren\u2019t technically equipped to deliver oil to long distances. It also needs to be noted that there are still countries like Russia, China, Turkey, Iran and several others that still support Maduro\u2019s regime. The member states of the EU, the US and other countries support Juan Guaido as interim president. However, the support from the countries like Russia and China strengthens Maduro\u2019s position. Furthermore, the possibility of international intervention has been on international agenda for awhile, but needs to be noted that it\u2019s almost impossible in this case. Most likely it would be the US to use military forces against Venezuela. However, even though Trump has hinted several times of such actions, he won\u2019t be able to get support from the Senate, as emphasized by the Democratic chairman of the House Foreign affairs committee.  The two major internal challenges for Maduro are Juan Guaido and the military support. Guaido has support from people as well as all the political parties that recognize him as a legitimate president. However, Maduro has demonstrated through his actions and the overall situation of the country is also a proof, that the fact that his people are suffering doesn\u2019t really bother him. He has military support, that is crucial for his presidency. It\u2019s obvious that if he loses military support, he won\u2019t be able to stay in power. However, military forces are now getting money from Maduro and with another person coming to power, they will lose the source of income and power along with it. Most likely they will be punished for their actions as well. Hence, I assume they will stay loyal to Maduro\u2019s regime as long as possible.  To sum up, I believe the above mentioned facts can at the same time be reason for him to cease being a president. Therefore, leaving some space for this option (in total 35% probability). However, he\u2019s been overcoming all the obstacles during his presidency for 6 years already, that makes me assume that he will remain the  president of Venezuela until January 2020.

However, the coup failed, and was driven only by a small deficient group. Moreover, the mobilization surrounding Guaido\u2019s initiative for turning back to Maduro by influencing the military, did not gather many people at the demonstrations, last week end.  In that sense, I would like to assign the same probabilities as firstly forecasted, that is, with a higher probability for \u201cnot before 1st January 2020\u201d. I assign a higher probability to this option because foreign intervention becomes less and less likely (Trump\u2019s latest declarations for instance) and also, thinking of several scenarios during the Arab Spring, where the military remained loyal to the power and suppressed the crisis e.g Saudi Arabia.  The peak of the crisis is seemingly not over, contrary to what I had previously forecasted. We are witnessing the opening of a new chapter of the Venezuelan crisis, with no more improvement although the small opening of hope on April 30th 2019. Nevertheless, I would like to pinpoint a high uncertainty in this forecast. Indeed, the military seems to be particularly loyal to Maduro, however, this could change sooner or later. But I would not forecast a change for the upcoming weeks. I believe that new dynamics  to the crisis are yet to come and will gradually draw perspective to the situation. Hence, I am still assigning a fair probability for a political change, this year. This forecast is based on the assumption that Maduro will be President until January 2020 (highest probability). If I consider a good probability for a change this year, I would rather expect this to happen after additional weeks/ months of confrontations, taking into account the current upheaval.

To this effect, this week posed both, signs of support for the regime within the security forces, as frictions. On the one hand, opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 had stood in front of a group of soldiers, on Tuesday, and assured the population by video message that the army was now turning around to free Venezuela from its \u201coppressor\u201d Maduro and by that started \u201cOperation Freedom\u201d However, despite demonstrators flocked to the military base in Caracas, only a few, about fifty soldiers, turned over to the opposition. Instead, the army leadership reassured Maduro of its allegiance and proved it by sending its soldiers out into the streets to break up the demonstrations. On the other hand, the liberation of the opposition leader Leopoldo L\u00f3pez from house arrest, on the same day, was a great success for the opposition. L\u00f3pez, who led the protests of 2014, has been in prison since then and is considered Guaid\u00f3's political foster father. He was apparently released by secret service officials - a sign of the cracks in Maduro's security apparatus, at least in the secret service. This is also supported by the fact that the commander of the secret service addressed Maduro in a letter in which he spoke of a \"renewal of the state\".  This stalemate made me adapt my forecast, that estimated a very high survival chance for the Maduro regime a bit in favor of the opposition, adding a 10% probability on a cease of the Maduro Regime before June 30, now 20%, and reducing the estimated likelihood of cease not before January 1, by 10%, towards now 70%. \n"], [176, "2019-05-03T03:29:45Z", [0.0, 0.4, 0.35, 0.25, 0.0], ""], [38, "2019-05-03T02:57:16Z", [0.0, 0.33, 0.27, 0.2, 0.2], "http://www.el-nacional.com/noticias/politica/urosa-con-maduro-frente-hay-solucion-para-venezuela_281199 The amazing @GL2814 found this.

The assessed internal pressure will be mainly comprised of support by the military elites and ordinary Venezuelans. The outside pressure is represented in the support or opposition of foreign states who have to some degree influence on Venezuela\u2019s politics (international big players such as USA, but also regional neighbours like Colombia).  The first aspect to assess is the loyalty of the military to Maduro and Guaido due to its powerful position within the country. Not only do the heads of the military branches possess significant power by themselves, current and former military personnel also occupy important positions within the Venezuelan political system and state-owned corporations in key areas, especially the oil sector (such as PdVSA). The military elite, therefore, dominates the political system and furthermore controls the main income of Venezuela. Their support and loyalty can make the difference in internal and external politics. The question is: how loyal is the military to Maduro or how likely are they to defect to Guaido? At this point of time, it seems that the higher levels of command are still loyal to Maduro. The socialist government ensures this loyalty by granting generals and higher officers privileges in regard to positions and wealth distribution. As a result, by deflecting to Guaido, these officers would risk losing their privileges, thus, decreasing the likelihood of them running over to the opposition. On the other side, low ranked military personnel seem more likely to defect as they don\u2019t enjoy the same privileges and, contrary to the military elites, face similar issues as ordinary Venezuelans such as a high inflation which undermines their purchasing power, as well as negative impacts on themselves and their families through missing public services (e.g.: health, food, education, etc.). Indeed, in the last months there were armed forces who changed their sides in favour of the opposition. Most of them classify as low ranked military personnel with only a few defectors from higher ranks (especially air force Gen. F. Yanez & head of the secret police M.R.C. Figuera), thus, affirming the assumptions made above. However, the numbers of renegades aren\u2019t high enough to indicate a significant change of loyalty in the military forces. Furthermore, the liberated opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez, as well as some armed forces loyal to Guaido, requested asylum in foreign embassies shortly after the Tuesday demonstration which indicates that the protest didn\u2019t manage to shift the tides in favour of Guaido. This raises the question why there aren\u2019t more defectors among lower ranks regarding the fact that they face the same issues as Venezuelan citizens? The answer might lie in the widespread and deep infiltration of the military through the intelligence services. As some analysts and commentators in international media argue, the insecurity posed through this infiltration decreases the motivation and, thus, the likelihood of waves of defectors running over to Guaido. It also seems that the Maduro regime focuses on breaking opposition cells within the armed forces to prevent a shift in loyalty (by using infamous death squads). Guaido himself admitted that his protest at the 30.04.2019 failed due to the lack of military defectors (BBC 2019).  Guaido is still able to mobilize large crowds of civilian protesters in Caracas. It seems that his support base hasn\u2019t lost its faith in him. However, so far Guaido avoided to march with this crowd towards symbolic institutions, such as the president\u2019s palace, which may indicate that Guaido himself doesn\u2019t believe to have enough supporters who are willing to actively protest on the streets for him. The recent march to an air force base represents a new level of escalation which, if continued, may lead to pro-Guaido supporters marching towards the president palace. This could either lead to a high enough pressure to convince Maduro to step down or to a bloody confrontation comparable to the Maidan revolution in Ukraine 2014 which in turn would enable foreign states to intervene. It is very likely that the already precarious circumstances will worsen in the next months which implies a potential for Guaido to increase his support base, nevertheless, his recruiting potential declines steadily if he doesn\u2019t manage to achieve significant successes in order to limit negative effects on his supporter\u2019s motivation. On the other hand, Maduro himself can rely on public support, too. His socialist party remains one of the most popular and his regime gains support amongst Venezuelans for state support in form of free food supplies and medical care (despite that these became very scarce). Furthermore, Maduro gains further popularity as he is seen as someone who resist the influence of \u201cimperialist forces\u201d (Venezuelan socialist fear an increased influence of the USA within their country). However, the involved uncertainties and the lack of reliable survey data makes it very difficult to assess who managed to gather more public support in Venezuela.  Additional to these internal factors, this forecast will also focus on external support or opposition by foreign states for/to the Maduro regime. For this purpose, it will mainly focus on the stances of Latin American states, the USA, the EU, Russia and other relevant states. The majority of Latin American states supports Guaido as legitimate interim president. Especially Brazil and Colombia oppose Maduro and requested from him to stand down, but Brazil\u2019s president declared on the 1st of May that his country won\u2019t intervene in Venezuela. Contrary to them, there is a minority which still supports Maduro as legitimate president (Bolivia, Nicaragua and Suriname). Cuba in particular is a main ally of the Maduro regime and supports it by providing additional military forces and other vital supplies. Both countries have a common history of friendship as they share more or less the same ideology. At the global scale there are mainly two blocs. The pro-Guaido bloc comprising several European states, Canada, Australia and Georgia headed by the US on the one side and the pro-Maduro bloc lead by Russia including China, Turkey, Greece and Iran on the other side. The US Secretary of State recently (01.05.2019) declared that his country would be willing to intervene militarily if a peaceful transition would be suppressed by the Maduro regime. The US and its allies already targeted the Venezuelan government by imposing sanctions on government officials and state-owned corporations and their subsidiaries, thus, de-facto isolating Venezuela from trade and the global markets, as well as freezing assets of regime loyal officials. On the other site, Russia is alleged to support the Maduro regime by providing funds, military equipment and assistants in internal espionage against the opposition. The Russian government often stressed their intentions and commitment to prevent a regime change and warned, especially the US, to overthrow the regime from the outside which decreases the likelihood for an US military intervention. Other pro-Maduro states take a more passive stance towards the issue by avoiding a direct confrontation with the US. For instance, China and Turkey continue their trade relations with Venezuela despite imposed sanctions from the US and the EU, thus, supporting the Maduro administration indirectly through trade revenue. India, which hasn\u2019t stated support for any faction, also continues to import oil from Venezuela, hence, keeping the crisis-shaken petroleum industry alive.  To conclude, Maduro and his regime seem to be able maintaining the loyalty of the Venezuelan military elite as it is unlikely that a majority of this elite will defect to Guaido regarding their unique privileges and favourable positions owing to the civil-military alliance drafted by Chavez. However, Guaido has a chance to convince low ranking military personnel to join him as they don\u2019t receive these privileges. Two factors seem to be decisive for this to happen: a) there has to be a momentum within the Venezuelan Army which convinces soldiers to defect and b) the grip of the intelligence services on the armed forces soften (by a lack of resources or through defectors in their own units). The sooner this happens the more likely it is that the military elite will be overthrown by its lower ranks which would be a vital hit to Maduro\u2019s ability to hold on his power. Contrary to this, more time for the Maduro regime means that the gradual losses of defecting soldiers can be substituted by Cuban army personnel, hence, decreasing the overall likelihood for a successful bottom-up uprising within Venezuela\u2019s armed forces. Therefore, the Venezuelan situation cannot be compared to Egypt\u2019s regime change during the Arab spring when the military elite decided to abandon its former president. The popular support of Guaido might be higher than Maduro\u2019s, however, so far none of the protests and events imposed a truly critical danger to Maduro. As a result, other successful regime changes in the Arab Spring (such as Tunisia) aren\u2019t good comparisons neither as the protesters there managed to gain a momentum and successfully increased the pressure fast enough to the point where their former government had no choice other than standing down. While Maduro faces firm opposition in the international community, he also receives vital support from key international actors. Especially Russia and China will block any decisive agreements against him within the UN Security Council. Furthermore, Maduro has a strong fundament to sustain the political turmoil in his country due to the support of Russia and Cuba. This fact makes it unlikely that there will be a regime change like the ones in Afghanistan, Iraq or Libya. The circumstances of the Venezuelan crisis, internal and external, mirror to some degree the situation Syria faces (except the missing civil war). In both countries, the majority of the military elite remained loyal to the president (despite prominent defectors in high ranks). Also, the population is split between the sides (Al-Assad was backed by the ethnical and religious minorities in his countries who feared a Sunni-majority led government at the beginning of the conflict. However, after a short time the factions split into several parts which ended the binary actor situation). The strongest argument for the similarity between Syria and Venezuela is the complex regional and international environment where different actors supported their favourite factions within the country and helped them to survive. Regarding the Syrian development it seems very unlikely that Maduro will cease to be president if Guaido doesn\u2019t manage to get rid of him soon. Another conflict, which isn\u2019t as similar as Syria, is the Ukraine conflict. It proves that the Russian Federation is willing to defend its strategic interest despite Western opposition. It could be argued that the Russian state is less likely to support Venezuela to the same degree as it backed Ukrainian separatists and Al-Assad due to decreasing resources, however, the involvement of China which supports Maduro\u2019s regime indirectly could easily substitute for the lack of Russian resources.  As a result, this forecast estimates that there is a moderate likelihood for Maduro to cease being president between 1 April 2019 and 30 June 2019 as Guaido will very likely try to force a regime change. However, this likelihood is assessed to drop sharply for the options which comprise the time period between 1 July 2019 and 31 December 2019 as Maduro will be able to consolidate his power with the help of foreign supporters. Currently there is a momentum for Guaido, nevertheless, it doesn\u2019t seem to achieve a critical level of support to become dangerous for Maduro. As a result, this forecast assesses that the likelihood for a regime change is less likely than Maduro remaining president.

Yesterday, Guaid\u00f2 called for an uprising against Maduro at a military base in the capital. This is an instrumental step in the Venezuelan crisis, illustrating increasing military support for Guaid\u00f2. As described in previous forecasts, Maduro's military backing to date has been a critical component in his capacity to remain in power. It was determined in the same forecasts that for Maduro to cease to be president before January 1st 2020, it would most likely be the outcome of a successful military coup. With an evident shift in military backing, and Guaid\u00f2's apparent ability to mobilise action, a successful coup now seems more possible than ever.

Over the last several months, the sources said, Prince has sought investment and political support for such an operation from influential Trump supporters and wealthy Venezuelan exiles. In private meetings in the United States and Europe, Prince sketched out a plan to field up to 5,000 soldiers-for-hire on behalf of Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, . . . One source said Prince has conducted meetings about the issue as recently as mid-April. White House National Security Council spokesman Garrett Marquis declined to comment when asked whether Prince had proposed his plan to the government and whether it would be considered. A person familiar with the administration\u2019s thinking said the White House would not support such a plan. Venezuela opposition officials have not discussed security operations with Prince, said Guaido spokesman . . .  Some U.S. and Venezuelan security experts, told of the plan by Reuters, called it politically far-fetched and potentially dangerous because it could set off a civil war. A Venezuelan exile close to the opposition agreed but said private contractors might prove useful, in the event Maduro\u2019s government collapses, by providing security for a new administration in the aftermath. A spokesman for Prince, Marc Cohen, said this month that Prince \u201chas no plans to operate or implement an operation in Venezuela\u201d and declined to answer further questions. Lital Leshem - the director of investor relations at Prince\u2019s private equity firm, Frontier Resource Group - earlier confirmed Prince\u2019s interest in Venezuela security operations. \u201cHe does have a solution for Venezuela, just as he has a solution for many other places,\u201d she said, declining to elaborate on his proposal. The two sources with direct knowledge of Prince\u2019s pitch said it calls for starting with intelligence operations and later deploying 4,000 to 5,000 soldiers-for-hire from Colombia and other Latin American nations to conduct combat and stabilization operations.\n. . . \nOne of Prince\u2019s key arguments, one source said, is that Venezuela needs what Prince calls a \u201cdynamic event\u201d to break the stalemate that has existed since January,. . .  . . .  Key government institutions \u2013 including the military \u2013 have not shifted their loyalty to Guaido despite increasing international pressure from sanctions imposed by the United States and its allies. Guaido has stressed that he wants a peaceful resolution, and Latin American governments recognizing his authority have urged against outside military action. Senior U.S. officials, without ruling out armed intervention, have also emphasized economic and diplomatic measures to pressure Maduro. Prince was a pioneer in private military contracting during the Iraq war, when the U.S. government hired Blackwater primarily to provide security for State Department operations there. In 2007, Blackwater employees shot and killed 17 Iraqi civilians at Nisour Square in Baghdad, sparking international outrage. One of the Blackwater employees involved was convicted of murder in December and three others have been convicted of manslaughter. Prince renamed the Blackwater security company and sold it in 2010, but he recently opened a company called Blackwater USA, which sells ammunition, silencers and knives. Over the past two years, he has led an unsuccessful campaign to convince the Trump administration to replace U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan with security contractors.\n. . . \nPrince donated $100,000 to a political action committee that supported Trump\u2019s election. His sister, Betsy DeVos, is the administration\u2019s education secretary.     Prince\u2019s role in Trump\u2019s campaign was highlighted in the report by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, . . . \n    The report outlined how Prince financed an effort to authenticate purported Hillary Clinton emails and how in 2016 he met in the Seychelles islands, off east Africa, with a wealthy Russian financial official on behalf of Trump\u2019s presidential transition team.\n. . . \nThe two sources with direct knowledge of Prince\u2019s Venezuela plan said he is seeking $40 million from private investors. He also aims to get funding from the billions of dollars in Venezuelan assets that have been seized by governments around the world imposing sanctions on the OPEC nation, a major oil exporter.

Several dozen armed troops accompanying Guaido clashed with soldiers . . . but the incident fizzled out and did not appear to be part of an immediate attempt by the opposition to take power through military force. Guaido, in a video posted on Twitter earlier on Tuesday, wrote that he had begun the \u201cfinal phase\u201d of his campaign to topple Maduro, calling on Venezuelans and the armed forces to back him ahead of May Day mass street protests planned for Wednesday.\n. . . \nDefense Minister Vladimir Padrino called the latest instability a \u201ccoup movement\u201d but several hours after Guaido\u2019s announcement there was no sign of any other anti-Maduro military activity and no immediate reports of casualties. Guaido later left a rally he was holding with military supporters at the air base. Repeated opposition attempts to force Maduro, a socialist, from power through huge protests and calls on the military to act have so far failed. Maduro said on Tuesday he had spoken with military leaders and that they had shown him \u201ctheir total loyalty.\u201d\n. . . \nThe move was Guaido\u2019s boldest effort yet to persuade the military to rise up against Maduro. If it fails, it could be seen as evidence that he lacks the support he says he has. It might also encourage the authorities, who have already stripped him of parliamentary immunity and opened multiple investigations into him, to arrest him.\n. . . \nGuaido\u2019s efforts appeared aimed at building momentum toward the May Day mass street protests and making them a turning point in his push to oust Maduro.  Guaido has said Wednesday\u2019s protests will be \u201cthe largest march in Venezuela\u2019s history\u201d and part of what he calls the \u201cdefinitive phase\u201d of his effort to take office in order to call fresh elections.\n. . . \nGuaido, the leader of Venezuela\u2019s opposition-controlled National Assembly, in January invoked the constitution to assume an interim presidency, arguing that Maduro\u2019s re-election in 2018 was illegitimate. U.S. President Donald Trump \u201chas been briefed and is monitoring the ongoing situation,\u201d White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Tuesday. The White House declined to comment on whether the administration had been consulted or had advance knowledge of what Guaido was planning. U.S. national security adviser John Bolton appeared to back Guaido\u2019s actions on Tuesday. \u201cThe FANB must protect the Constitution and the Venezuelan people. It should stand by the National Assembly and the legitimate institutions against the usurpation of democracy,\u201d Bolton tweeted, referring to the FANB armed forces. Conservative Republicans in Washington welcomed the reports from Venezuela. Senator Marco Rubio, a hard-liner on Venezuela, urged Venezuelans to take to the streets: \u201cDo not allow this moment to slip away. It may not come again,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. Brazil\u2019s right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro expressed his nation\u2019s solidarity for the people of Venezuela, who he said were \u201censlaved by a dictator.\u201d Venezuelan Information Minister Jorge Rodriguez on Tuesday tweeted that the government was confronting a small group of \u201cmilitary traitors\u201d seeking to promote a coup.\n. . . \nMaduro, for his part, has appeared to retain control of state institutions and the loyalty of senior military officers and has foreign allies such as Russia and Cuba. Russia\u2019s foreign ministry on Tuesday accused the Venezuelan opposition of resorting to violence in what it said was a brazen attempt to draw the country\u2019s armed forces into clashes. Maduro has called Guaido a U.S-backed puppet who seeks to oust him in a coup. The government has arrested his top aide, stripped Guaido of his parliamentary immunity and opened multiple probes. It has also barred him from leaving the country, a ban Guaido openly violated earlier this year. Last week, Guaido said his congressional ally - opposition lawmaker Gilber Caro - had been detained, and that 11 members of his team had been summoned to appear before the Sebin intelligence agency. Lopez, seen with Guaido, appeared to have left his home for the first time since being placed under house arrest in 2017, after three years in jail. \u201cI have been freed by soldiers on the side of the constitution and President Guaido,\u201d he tweeted. All of us have to mobilize. It\u2019s time to win our freedom.\u201d A soldier in the group with Guaido, who identified himself just as Rivas, denied government accusations that they had been tricked into backing Guaido. \u201cWe\u2019re all afraid,\u201d he told Reuters, \u201cbut we had to do it\u201d.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  I'm adjusting my forecast because something could come of this, but I'll not be holding my breath.

In fact, in a video shot near the La Carlota military base and  surrounded by soldiers, opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 has appealed to the people of Venezuela and the country's military to end the government of President Nicolas Maduro:  \"People of Venezuela, we must all demonstrate to support democracy and recover our freedom. Organized and united, we need to head for major military installations. As chairman in charge and legitimate head of the armed forces, I convince all the military to follow us in our actions as we have always done in the sign of the Constitution and of the non-violent struggle and to accompany us in this process for the end of the usurpation\". - Guaid\u00f2 affirmed in his 3-minute video message.  Therefore, it looks like the final round of this dispute has come. Guaid\u00f2 called for action, both of the military forces and the civil society, and it looks determined to go until the end. For this reason, if Maduro ceases to be President, this is going to happen soon.  For this reason, I increase the option\" between 1 April 2019 and 30 June\" to 35% and I lower the not happening option to 55%.  I do not go further because I am still skeptical about Guaid\u00f2's chances to succeed, also because Maduro just stated that the government \" is facing and neutralizing a small group of traitorous soldiers who have occupied the Altamira Distributor\". Nevertheless, both Maduro's and Guaid\u00f2's claims might be driven by propaganda purposes so it is impossible to exactly know whether the President is dealing with a small number of revolters or not.    That said, if nothing happens in the following period, I will significantly increase the not happening option because for Guaid\u00f2 would probably be game over.

For these reasons, i keep my prediction about Maduro ceasing of being president between 1 April and 30 June at 15%.\nHowever, EU has not yet announce a common and shared by all the eu members declaration against Maduro. Putin has sent military planes to support the president through the airspace of Greece and Cyprus from Syria en route to Venezuela on March 22 and 23. Even if the more recent Russia request to use Malta airspace to sent other planes has been rejected, it's evident the concrete Russian endorsement Maduro. Moreover, I think that Russian help can be a deterrent for countries as US, in order to dis-courage the american military intervention and a \"change regime\" in the next months (as occurred in Syria for Assad before ISIS defeat).\nIn addition, considering  a comparison with the Syrian situation, Assad has faced a big crisis in its country in the last years but has been able to maintain its power, also thanks to the Russian backing.

If he was going to be swayed by protests and international pressure, he wouldn't have cracked down so hard and would've given indication of his abdication by now. That fact that he hasn't indicates that he is not a leader swayed by public opinion nor international pressure. The latter of which rings true of Valenzuela's anti imperialist socialist revolution.  Thereby Maduro is the type of leader does not seek to uphold democratic values of his country and will suppress his own people to remain in power and does not care what the world or citizens thinks of it. This  type of leader is one that often remain in power until they are forced out through coups, internal political struggles or become sick/elderly.  As to his age and health, Maduro is 56 and seemingly in good health. So I find there to be 0% chance of him stepping down from his presidency by the start of 2020 due to these reasons.  Which means if he was to cease to be president by 2020 it would have to be by an internal or external coup or mounting political pressure from Venezuelan elites.  At this point in time the protests have been primarily orchestrated by and for the masses. While some elites may be dissatisfied, the ones who remain in important places to pressure Maduro have been primarily shielded by the crisis that has hit Venezuela and they owe this to Maduro. For the most part Maduro has been generous in his dealings with military and political elites, thereby buying their loyalty because without Maduro they would be thrust into the current economic crisis. This is especially true of the Military's top brass who have shown unwavering support for Maduro. Thereby, I conclude that Maduro will not face enough internal pressure by 2020 to decide to resign. I also conclude that there will not by a top level coup, the type which is often most effective, against Maduro. This leaves an internal bottom level coup and an external coup as options to remove Maduro. I predict that there will be no external coups attempts on Maduro by 2020. This type of coup would most likely be orchestrated by the US. While Trump does have the personality to desire and order a coup, such plans take a long time to formulate and put in action. If a coup was being planned, it only would've begun earlier this year and I find it highly unlikely they would implement it within a year. Furthermore, I do not think this option is being seriously considered for two reasons. For one, Maduro is supported by Russia and China, two states the US is not eager to enrage over the possibility of maybe deposing Maduro. Secondly, a US backed coup would not be supported by a majority of Americans, whom are fatigued and tired of US involvement in military conflicts. Furthermore, presidential elections are nearing and campaigning has begun, which leaves the White House open to a lot of criticism.  So the last option is an international bottom level coup/civil war. I do believe this is possible. There are many documented cases in history of mid level military commanders orchestrating coups. However, the Maduro Government is on high alert and claims to have already uncovered and squashed coup attempts. These types of coups are definitely harder to orchestrate, implement  and keep secret resulting in a lower likelihood of success. I think it is possible, but highly unlikely, thereby I attribute a 1% chance it could happen and be successful between July and September 30th and a 3% chance it could happen and be successful between October 1st and December 31st.  Finally there could be a civil war. I find that this is the most likely outcome due to the fact that many soldiers in the army have been defecting and Guaid\u00f3 is actively encouraging this and offering pardons for those who support him. However, if a civil war does break out, civil wars are often long and not focused on removing opposition leaders,  especially considering that  given Maduro's  disposition thus far, I find that he'll more than likely decide to fight the civil war rather than step down to prevent it. Thereby, I give a 1% chance that a civil war could remove Maduro between October 1st and December 31st.

If correct, this information is of great importance: Ciudad Guayana is crucial for the whole Venezuelan electricity sector\u2014it hosts the headquarters of CVG Electrificaci\u00f3n del Caron\u00ed (CVG Edelca), Venezuela\u2019s main electricity producer. Moreover, the area contains two dams Tocoma and Guri, with the latter, known as the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar Hydroelectric Plant, being the fourth-largest hydroelectric power station in the world in terms of generation capacity. Russia\u2019s deployment of military personnel to Venezuela raises two additional issues. First, as argued by the Cuban media, the arrival of the Russian experts was apparently initiated by the vice president of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela, Diosdado Cabello\u2014a person with huge ambitions and once seen as heir apparent to Hugo Chavez. It thus might be assumed that if Maduro\u2019s popularity continues to plunge, Cabello could step in as his successor or replacement (Periodicocubano.com, March 26). Such a prospect, if it is not already being discussed behind the scenes, would not be totally unexpected for the Kremlin. Second, on March 30, Cuban media reported that Caracas received 65 tons of aid from China (Periodicocubano.com, March 30). Given the fact that Beijing has already invested $50 billion in the Venezuelan economy and Moscow has injected $17 billion, neither government is presumably ready to lose this Latin American country.\"\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  This supports my imaginary narrative that Russia is looking for someone to replace Maduro.

At first, I though, \"Oh, April 1st is 6 weeks away; lots can happen in 6 weeks!  Look at how fast Mugabe lost power!\"  Then I thought, \"Guiado has gotten international support!

Then, when Guiado returned like a conquering hero, I thought, \"This is it!\"  But no.  When there was the power outage, I thought that when the lights came on we'd discover that Guiado was in the presidential palace and Maduro was in Cuba.  But no, again!

My take is that it is highly likely that Maduro will lose his position within the next 6 months. Yes, the military still support him, but the blackout is a big hit and he does not have resources to truly eliminate reasons of the power loss. That will change thinking of his supporters.

I think the military plays a huge role in helping Maduro to stay in power. Even though a multilateral body called Lima Group expects that their proposed sanctions against military officials will force them to turn their backs to the president, I wouldn't consider that sanctions would have such high efficiency. It might have an effect on changing opinions of some individuals though. \nAnother issue is fragmented and divided opposition. Hence, there is not a huge danger coming from political opponents. \nThird, it is obvious that Maduro is strongly pressed by the UN, EU. United States even recognised opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 as interim leader. However, there are such countries like Russia and China (often and Turkey) that usually are very willing to take a stand against Europe and the United States while supporting dictatorships. \nFourth, and probably the hardest thing to admit, after some time countries are very likely to get tired of pressuring Venezuela and step back. Annexed Crimea's case and Venezuela's situation are not very familiar. However, it shares the same IR practice. Even though in the case of annexed Crimea, Russia is still facing sanctions, we can see that the situation is almost normalised. Therefore, that would be my guess for Venezuela as well. Military intervention is very unlikely in this case.  On the other hand, Venezuela is in a huge humanitarian crisis. People's dissatisfaction and unrest are growing with every single day. Therefore, there are many factors that can come together, create so-called a perfect storm and determine the end of Maduro's regime. Therefore, I leave 30 % likelihood that it can happen during 2019. As for the timing, even though the chances of Maduro's exit are small, I think it increases through the year, as the humanitarian crisis is going deeper in Venezuela.

People are growing more impatient with Maduro, especially following the blackouts and the lack of action taken to fix the issue, increasing tensions.

My thinking was influenced by events right after Maduro\u2019s second term inauguration in January.  With the rapid-firing events, it is easy to imagine a rapid collapse of the Maduro government then.  But it appears that things are settling down now and it will be a long haul for a potential change in the Venezuela government.   Rationale: Shortly after the inauguration of Maduro second term, Guaido was declared to be the interim President by the National Assembly.  About 50 countries recognized Guaido as the Venezuela leader soon afterwards.  These include the Lima Group, many South American countries, US, and a dozen European countries (but not the EU which could not come up with a consensus among its 28 members).  It is followed by massive demonstrations with some loss of life.  One high ranking air force general and some diplomats declared their allegiance to Guaido. While all these events are favorable to Guaido, it appears that the momentum has stalled.  The humanitarian aids organized by Guaido and his allies have been stopped at the border.  It has been speculated that the entry of these aids would result in massive defection of the soldiers, but it did not happen.  Furthermore there was no additional defection by more high ranking officers. The path for Guaido is narrow; it is either external pressure or internal defection.   Extension pressure could come as military intervention or economic sanction.  The only possible military intervention is from the US.  But it is unlike as Trump is mired in his own problems and Pence has declared that the US has no timeline for Venezuela [1].  Venezuela has endured economic problems (including sanctions) for a long time since the first Maduro term in 2013.  But his regime withstood years of demonstrations (some of which are violent), hyperinflation, mass migration out of the country and lack of food and medicine.  Further sanctions could result in regime change but very slowly, if at all.   The only quick way to power for Guaido is through military support.  So far most of the military establishment is not siding with him even though he has been wooing them and clemency was even offered.  It would take more action from Guado to facilitate the military to abandon Maduro. I don\u2019t know what that is that he can do as he and his allies have tried all the things described above already. Recently there are power outages throughout the country.  I don\u2019t know what caused those, but it is possible that they are due to sabotage from Guaido's allies (another thing to try).  The blackouts would further destabilizes the government.  But I don\u2019t see the military would turn because of that. I am not being optimistic here.  It looks like the only path for a regime change is a civil war (remember Maduro has the support of the military as well as about 25% of the population [3] which benefited from Chavez\u2019s socialist policy).

While the US, Canada and some European and Latin American countries have backed Guaid\u00f3\u2019s presidency, he has little legitimate power at this stage. Maduro still stands as elected president \u2014 while this is highly controversial and contested \u2014 and shows little indication of conceding defeat despite large international opposition. This is partly because Maduro\u2019s position has been strengthened by Russia and China, who have supported Maduro and blocked the UN Security Council\u2019s push to back Guaid\u00f3 (CNN 24 Jan 2019; Reuters 5 Feb 2019). Venezuela is thus in a leadership impasse, and the plausible scenarios for which Maduro will cease to be president must be considered in order to make a reasonable forecast.  1.  Voluntary resignation. Based on his actions to date, this is improbable.  2. International military intervention. Despite intervention in the form of US and EU sanctions, a physical military intervention is not foreseeable. The embargo is the best option to cripple Maduro logistically, strategically and operationally less effort than military intervention which would be require an estimated 100, 000 US troops (Miami Herald, 10 Feb 2019).   3. It appears then that Venezuela\u2019s own security forces will be instrumental in sustaining, or bringing down, Maduro\u2019s rule during 2019:  For the most part, security forces have been loyal to Maduro \u2014 and have been rewarded with pay rises and various other handouts for that loyalty. On January 23, following Guaid\u00f3\u2019s announcement, high-level military personnel voiced their continued support of Maduro (CNN 24 Jan 2019). But, with Guaid\u00f3 promising amnesty to military members and politicians who defect, this loyalty may waver in the future. Already, up to 600 lower-ranking soldiers have been abandoning their posts. On January 21, a military revolt was suppressed by the government (Irish Times 23 Feb 2019; BBC 23 Feb 2019). This indicates the probability of a military overthrow is increasing. However, it is highly unlikely this will occur in the coming weeks given that the majority of security forces remain publicly loyal to Maduro, ruling out the option that Maduro will cease to be president before April 1. Based on historic data on coup and coup attempts though, the longer Maduro remains in power, the greater the likelihood of a military takeover. Right now, Venezuelan GDP per capita \u2014 an influential factor in inciting previous coups to date \u2014 is comparatively higher than countries that have previously experienced an attempt (its own 2002 attempt included). This, paired with the factors already mentioned \u2014 particularly current military support \u2014 indicate that a successful coup is unlikely to occur this year. But the likelihood increases the with each month that passes; where, \u2018Maduro\u2019s biggest vulnerability is the prospect of further economic decline\u2019 (The Conversation 31 January 2019). While an overthrow of Maduro is likely before the next election, it is considered most probable that this will occur after January 1, 2020 \u2014 in that international intervention has been argued as unlikely, more time is needed for the situation in Venezuela to worsen to the point that military member and politicians are willing to defect and remove the president by force."], [40848, "2019-03-07T16:23:58Z", [0.07, 0.18, 0.07, 0.05, 0.63], ""], [62737, "2019-03-07T11:13:26Z", [0.37, 0.43, 0.01, 0.0, 0.19], "Time."], [67798, "2019-03-07T09:31:59Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.8], ""], [34376, "2019-03-07T08:50:24Z", [0.15, 0.15, 0.04, 0.01, 0.65], ""], [19801, "2019-03-07T05:07:48Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "Venezuela has beaten US sanctions.

US sanctions and the role of the international community: While more than 50 countries accepted Guaido as Venezuela\u2019s interim president, most of them ruled out a military intervention, such as the Lima Group states or the European ones (https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-47436804). The US that explicitly did leave the option to intervene open, has with Elliot Abrams a special representative and hardliner on the top with experience in interventions in Latin America (during the Cold War) (https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ilhan-omar-elliott-abrams-venezuela-envoy-clash-over-us-meddling-in-latin-america/). However, they will most likely not intervene militarily due to the high risks aligned with a military operation. The same holds true for Russia. However, on 01/03 the US imposed additional visa restrictions and sanctions against Venezuelan officials and militaries (https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/01/politics/abrams-us-venezuela-sanctions/index.html). These are only the latest in a series of sanctions by the US. In particular, the sanctions announced by the Treasury Department on 28/01 that prohibited US companies and individuals from doing business with Venezuela\u2019s state-run oil company Pdvsa have potentially severe effects for the country and Maduro\u2019s regime, because the oil exports to the US are Venezuela\u2019s biggest source of incoming cash (oil exports to Russia and China mostly compensate for already existing debts) (https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/08/world/americas/venezuela-sanctions-maduro.html). After the announcement of the sanctions, export reduced by 40% within a week. Now the new American sanctions could cut Venezuela\u2019s oil exports by two-thirds, to just $14 billion this year, and lead to a 26 percent reduction in the economy\u2019s size (Ibid.). The idea behind the sanctions is to increase people\u2019s suffering and promote even larger protests. They are also supposed to hit high level militaries and thereby motivate them to change sides (refer to military.) However, due to a strong illegal economy, that many of them benefit from, the central military leaders will most likely be able to survive the sanctions: \u201cas we have learnt from Cuba, authoritarian regimes can be very resilient [against sanctions].\u201d (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/03/will-venezuela-oil-sanctions-be-the-silver-bullet-to-fell-maduro-regime) Another aspect that motivates the forecast at hand to assume a high probability of the Maduro regime to survive at least until 01/01/20, is the financial support of Russia. As a consequence of US sanctions, Russia\u2019s state-run Rosneft has increased its output in Venezuela (Ibid.). Furthermore due to the nature of the global oil market, many analysts assume that Venezuela could find new markets in Asia, if it was willing to lower the price (https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/08/world/americas/venezuela-sanctions-maduro.html). These measurements could be sufficient to hold Maduro in power. Next to financial support from Russia, Venezuela can furthermore rely upon political support of Russia and China, e.g. in the UN. On 01/03 both members of the security council rejected a US resolution, demanding presidential elections (https://www.dw.com/en/venezuela-us-resolution-vetoed-by-russia-china-at-un-security-council/a-47734238).  Military: The military is the most important pillar of the Maduro regime, alongside the party's mass organizations and public sector workers; In particular, due to the low probability of a military intervention of foreign forces that would enforce the claim of self-appointed interim president Guaido (refer to impact on US sanctions). Without external support Guaido is dependent on the support of the Venezuelan military. While he managed to mobilize the masses with many former Maduro supporters changing sides (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/10/venezuela-maduro-chavez-guaido-protests), the regime managed so far to prevail their influence over the military. This got particular clear, when the military blocked the entry of humanitarian aid into the country in February (https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/world/americas/venezuela-aid-block-brazil.html?module=inline). As a consequence, Guaido and the opposition reached a dead end after the failed attempt to break the blockade that got stylized as a \u201eshutdown\u201c and the \u201eend of Maduro.\u201c In the end, the humanitarian corridor did not open; instead, after the failed coup, the borders were closed and numerous opposition politicians were stuck in Colombia - including Guaido himself. The influence of Maduro over the military is so strong due to the diversity of groups that belong and profit from the military. Thus the military is not just a single professional vertical organization that can gained over by winning over the leading figures (https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/opinion/venezuela-military-maduro-guaido.html). Within this diverse groups reasons for the support of Maduro differ. Within the military high command many continue to believe in the ideology Maduro represents. Others enjoy big influence within the government and a huge range of benefits: leading ministerial posts for instance are filled by generals (https://www.swp-berlin.org/kurz-gesagt/2019/endspiel-in-venezuela/); Many others are engaged in lucrative illicit activities, such as drug trafficking (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/theworldpost/wp/2019/02/07/venezuela-military/?utm_term=.72cc0f83e4b5). All of these leading groups in the military can\u2019t be interested in a regime change, since the probability is very high that this would mean a loss of power and money for them. This holds also true despite Guaido\u2019s promises of amnesty. This might be convincing the ordinary soldiers - that also experience the same poverty and humanitarian crisis as the rest of the population - but it is considered as highly unlikely that this would lead to a mass exodus.  Based upon these two drivers the forecast at hand estimates the probability of Maduro to cease before 01/04/19 and between 01/04/19 and 30/06/19 as rather low, each as of 15%. However, the chances for this event to materialize are still perceived higher as between 01/07/19 and 30/09/19, as well as between 01/10/19-31/12/19 , each attributed with a 5% probability. This is due to the attention the Venezuelan opposition enjoys at the moment in the international community as well as the perception of a change being possible, both internationally and within the Venezuelan population. Guaido\u2019s return to Venezuela for instance were accompanied by many Western ambassadors, wich might have prevented Maduro from arresting him right away and stealing the opposition\u2019s leader and biggest threat to him (https://lex18.com/news/2019/03/04/the-latest-anti-maduro-protesters-gather-in-venezuela/). This support might motivate the population further, in particular in combination with the sanctions and the amnesty that might lead low level soldiers to change sides. However, when the interest of the international community will move on to the next crises in the world, and an overlong stalement will realize, Guaido will most likely lose the support of the masses, aligned with a further willingness from militaries to change sides. That is why, the paper at hand estimates the likelihood of Maduro to stay in power at least until 01/01/20 as the most likely scenario with a probability of 60%."], [45775, "2019-03-06T00:17:54Z", [0.1, 0.25, 0.3, 0.3, 0.05], "The people are in a bad situation, lack of food, starvation....weather will heat up...tension will flare...I think Maduro will be out during the peak heated Summer"], [41922, "2019-03-05T23:22:44Z", [0.07, 0.3, 0.13, 0.13, 0.37], ""], [63512, "2019-03-05T21:02:05Z", [0.02, 0.13, 0.15, 0.15, 0.55], ""], [1056, "2019-03-05T13:30:18Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.9], "It will be interesting to see if 1) Maduro arrests Guaido when he thinks it's safe, and 2) what the reaction will be.

For this reason, I assess that there is only a very little chance (2%) that Maduro will be overturned before April 21, which is in less than one month. In order to have such an outcome, it would be necessary an International intervention. In this regard, Although Trump recently stated that a military option for Venezuela was \"not off the table\u201d, before to play the military card the U.S.A would have to face a strong debate, both at the internal and international level. Indeed, the reputation of American interventionism has been strongly affected by the inconclusive and controversial external actions undertaken in recent years (e.g. Iraqi invasion). For this reason, at the internal level, before to intervein Trump would have to convince the parliament that it won\u2019t be the umpteenth huge financial loss without any final benefit in return. At the external level, the Trump\u2019s administration would have to convince the international community that is not another \u201cAmerican attempt of imperialism in the name of democracy\u201d as over the years has been increasingly argued. Furthermore, on a side note, in order to legally legitimize such intervention, a motion should pass in the UN Security Council, where the Russian Federation detain (and is likely to use) the veto power. Yet, there is still the \u201cUniting for peace\u201d motion (a formula which permits the UN General Assembly to allow a humanitarian intervention in case of an impasse in the Security Council), however it has rarely been used since the born of the United Nation. Therefore, the actual likelihood of American intervention, at least in the short term, is basically low. A fortiori since Russia is defending Nicolas Maduro\u2018s claim to the presidency in Venezuela and has strong interests in the region. What is more probable is that both Russia and the USA will indirectly sustain the two factions engaging a sort of new proxy War. However, even if such an outcome unfolded, it would require a long and bloody process before a radical political change happens (as it is the case of Assad in Syria who, despite 8 years of civil and proxy war, still holds the power).  For the reasons above, I consider the most likely scenario Maduro being still in power in January 2020, which I have assessed with a 60% chance. That said, other possible scenarios must be taken into consideration. As Daniel Lansberg-Rodr\u00edguez (2019) noted, \u201cthe more atrocities Venezuela\u2019s dictator commits, the less likely his regime is to survive him\u201d. In this regard, the recent Maduro\u2019s refusal of humanitarian aids from USA (240 tons of medicines and food), considering them a sort of Trojan horse and accusing the US of interference in internal affairs and closing the relations with Colombia and Brazil, it is everything but beneficial for Maduro\u2019s popularity and legitimation. The diplomatic isolation and the worsening of the internal humanitarian conditions (although considered by Maduro the consequence of the infamous American sanctions) might lead the military and security forces to shift side or to independently claim the power. Without military support, the end of the Maduro\u2019s regime would unfold rapidly.  However, if it is hard to assess whether such a scenario will unfold or not, it is even harder to deem when it is more likely to happen. In this regard, I believe it as more likely between April and June 2019 (20% chance) since the debate over the future of Venezuela is vivid as never before and Guido\u2019s symbolic act still fresh. The more time will pass, the more Venezuela risk to be stacked in an impasse similar to the Syrian one, lowering the chances of an overthrown of president Maduro.

Today it is 28 February 2019, that is, there is one month left for Maduro to cease to be president of Venezuela. In my opinion, this is the less likely option. Indeed, Maduro seems to remain particularly determined to keep his power, for now. He is using of repression against his population/opponents and is still benefiting from strong pillars of Venezuelan power. In addition, this crisis is undergoing a spillover on the international scene and provides the United States and Russia with the opportunity to continue their historic and endless arm wrestling in international affairs. If the United States are supporting Guaido and are currently working on the allocation of humanitarian aid to Venezuela, Putin had previously agreed on an economic and military support with Maduro. In that sense, it is more likely that both sides remain to the stage of diplomatic interpositions in the next weeks, leaving a room for Maduro to keep his power in this period of time. For instance, if Trump declared that he did not exclude the option for a military intervention, I believe that four weeks is too short for stepping foot in Venezuela as the endeavours will firstly remain focused on the allocation of humain aid.  40% Between 1 April 2019 and 30 June 2019 inclusive. I believe this interval of time will be determining for the political crisis in Venezuela. For instance, if Donald Trump does not gain access to Venezuela through humanitarian aid, it is more likely that within this period of time \u2014 if he really envisages to launch a military intervention \u2014 this will happen between April and June 2019. Besides American intervention, I expect the following months to be determining on other aspects. Facing the violence and complexity of the crisis, we could \u2014 for example \u2014 expect the military to cease being loyal to Maduro, causing a upheaval in the crisis. In other words, I believe that if Maduro will cease to be president in 2019, this will happen while the peak of the crisis is still going.  15% Between 1 July 2019 and 30 Septembre 2019 inclusive. As argued above, it is more likely that Maduro will cease to be president of Venezuela while the peak of the crisis is going. However, I expect the peak to be over by June 2019. In that sense, my argument is that it is less likely that Maduro leaves the presidency when his power survived to the turmoil.  10% Between 1 October 2019 and 31 December 2019 inclusive - Same argument. If Maduro has not left the presidency by 1 October 2019, this would mean that the situation has stabilized with Maduro in power. 30% Not before 1 January 2020.

The reasons why he is in the condition to behave in this way are the national military support and the political and economic support that he receives from Russia, China and Turkey.

Internationally, the number of States which decided to actively support a line of action in Venezuela is increasigly both on Guaid\u00f2's side - USA - or on new elections' side - EU. Internally, Maduro's decision not to accept the majority of the external aid - wether economic or in food and medical supplies - is enhancing the protests. Even so, we don't have to forget Maduro's ability in maintaining power with powerful international - Russia, Cuba, China - and internal - police and military - allies (https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2017/05/10/why-is-venezuelas-nicolas-maduro-still-in-power )\nMoreover, US explicit line against Maduro (in Mike Pompeo's word, his days are numbered, https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-47348293 ) sounds a lot like an incoming coup. If this possibility will be enforced, we can assume that it's more likely as time passes and the situation get worse. \nFinally, I would say that, given the delicate situation, a \"solution\" on Venezuela's situation will take its time, or no time. Maduro is strongly committed in not letting Trojan horses enter his country and not organizing elections. I think the two most probable outcomes are an immediate retaliation against Maduro - coup, or, as already happening, economic sanctions such as increased oil exchange rates - in the immediate future (before the 1st of April) or a longer stall that eventually will depose him.

He was flanked by ambassadors of several countries that have joined the group, which includes China, Cuba, Iran, Nicaragua, North Korea, Russia and Syria. Diplomats said the group totaled about 50 nations.\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/world/americas/venezuela-united-nations-support.html Why Is Nepal Sticking up for Venezuela\u2019s Maduro?\nhttps://thediplomat.com/2019/02/why-is-nepal-sticking-up-for-venezuelas-maduro/ Much of the attention on Venezuela\u2019s non-hemispheric allies has focused on China and Russia. Yet, in the face of an unprecedented legitimacy crisis, Caracas has deepened its alliances with a group of lower-profile \u2014 and sometimes like-minded \u2014 regimes across the globe. These countries have become vital partners, filling the void at a time when Maduro is struggling diplomatically in his own region. The map below shows how the world reacted to the Venezuelan presidential elections. In addition to Russia, China and Iran, other notable countries that recognized the results included Turkey, Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Vietnam and Belarus. Political, economic and military engagements have gradually increased in recent years between Venezuela and several of these countries.

That was the message from the International Energy Agency (IEA) in its latest Oil Market Report. The world has plenty of oil, but perhaps not the right type of oil. A series of events have caused the market for light oil to diverge from that of medium and heavier blends. This trend has been underway for some time, but the deviation has magnified recently, and could cause havoc as 2019 wears on. The backdrop is the surge in U.S. shale production. The multi-year boom in light sweet oil from Texas and North Dakota, among other places, has added huge volumes of light oil to global supply. The U.S. Gulf Coast, where much of this oil is heading, has not been able to keep up. Refiners are churning out as much as possible, which has led to a glut of gasoline. But excess barrels have been increasingly exported, adding huge volumes of light oil onto the global market. To accommodate steadily rising barrels of light oil, OPEC and its non-OPEC partners have backed out their own supplies in order to prevent a crash in prices. But many OPEC members produce medium and heavier blends. The quantity of global supply may not be vastly different, but the quality of the crude slate has changed dramatically.\nFrom: https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Emerging-Quality-Problem-To-Haunt-Oil-Markets.html"], [767, "2019-02-15T02:18:21Z", [0.25, 0.3, 0.2, 0.05, 0.2], ""], [23006, "2019-02-14T22:16:46Z", [0.25, 0.3, 0.25, 0.2, 0.0], ""], [1056, "2019-02-14T15:10:10Z", [0.4, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05, 0.25], "Interesting article from the CBC: 'I won't shoot my people': Soldier reflects on Venezuela's political crisis https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/venezuela-military-soldiers-maduro-guaido-1.5018689 According to the article - and as I suspected - the Bolivarian militia is useless as a combat force.

Although I have listed a strong representation of factors against Maduro\u2019s regime (the collection undoubtedly is bigger than the pro-Maduro, as the media coverage tend to sway towards ousting the current president), I hypothesize that Maduro\u2019s grip on the power will remain strong, continuously fueled the army, by the political inertia and society\u2019s fear of bloodbath.

This has seen the spread between the two grades narrow to just US$1.35/bbl, compared to a spread of US$3.20/bbl in March 2018. The narrowing of this spread does highlight the supply issues that we are seeing with the heavier grade of crude oil.\nhttps://think.ing.com/snaps/the-commodities-feed-heavy-crude-osp-raised/ The Dubai crude complex -- the spread between prompt Dubai swap and cash -- remained steadily in backwardation through the last quarter of 2018, despite both Brent and WTI seeing deep contango in their respective market structures during the same period. The spread between Brent futures and Dubai swaps averaged $2.58/b in Q3 of 2018, according to Platts data. The same spread narrowed to $1.86/b over Q4, and has narrowed even further to $1.16/b to date in January. A narrow Brent/Dubai EFS spread implies that medium to heavy sour Dubai-linked crude grades are getting relatively pricier compared to lighter, sweeter Brent-linked crude grades. The spread dipped to 99 cents/b as of 0300 GMT during Asian trading hours on Wednesday.\nhttps://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/oil/012319-analysis-opec-cuts-amplify-supply-side-imbalances-in-crude-oil 'IMO 2020' is going to usher in a mammoth sea change for the global petroleum market. On January 1, 2020, the International Maritime Organization (hark, IMO) - the agency that regulates the global shipping market - will enforce a global sulfur cap of 0.5 percent on marine fuels. While this is this going to have the biggest impact on fuel oil and middle distillates, it is also going to influence the crude flows of heavy sweet barrels. In fact, it already is. Heavy sweet crude is going to be increasingly in demand in 2020, as refiners look to pivot towards producing low sulfur fuel oil. (See a particularly good rant here on the topic from @Big_Orrin on Twitter). Lest we forget, lighter crude yields less fuel oil, while sour crude raises the sulfur content. The challenge for the global market is going to be getting its hands on heavy sweet crude. \nhttps://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Heavy-Sweet-Crude-Is-Heading-For-A-Supply-Crisis.html Lest we forget the confident predictions made just a short time ago.

The first was the overthrow of Chile's President Salvador Allende in 1973. This explains its efforts to placate the Venezuelan military. The national guard, which has been in the frontline quelling demonstrations, has been awarded bonuses for its good offices. The second case was Grenada in 1983, where Cuban influence was undermined by the regime's mistakes, prior to invasion by American troops. Havana is consequently determined to shore up Maduro's authority and end the dispute with his rival, Captain Diosdado Cabello, who is head of the National Assembly and deputy leader. The third scenario to avoid is an election in the throes of an economic crisis, as occurred in Nicaragua in 1990. So the priority in Venezuela is to stop inflation and end the shortages that are sapping popular support for the Chavistas. An election is due next year. Havana is clearly keen to maintain the status quo.

I'm sure there have been fatalities in a variety of incidents associated with the unrest in Venezuela. However, once there are fatalities that are directly blamed on Maduro, the more likely it is that he will attempt to cling to power at all costs.

So there will be no place that can actually guarantee him asylum; he will be considered an international outlaw. So for him to flee and accept an offer of asylum is a taking a real chance - he can be handed over at any time, and used as a bargaining chip by his host country.

The move marked the first punitive step by the United States to force Mr. Maduro to give up power since the opposition leader, Juan Guaid\u00f3, declared himself interim president .  . . . . .  Administration officials said the financial penalties are expected to block $7 billion in assets and result in $11 billion in export losses over the next year for Venezuela\u2019s government, starving it from its most important source of revenue and foreign currency.\n. . . \nIn an interview Monday before the sanctions were announced, Mr. Guaid\u00f3 said his nascent government was making every effort it could to get control of Venezuela\u2019s international assets \u2014 and mainly the state oil company.\n. . . Mr. Guaid\u00f3 said the National Assembly estimated that $30 billion had gone missing from the oil company in recent years.\n. . . \nSanctions on Pdvsa potentially put at risk as much as a half-million barrels of oil that the United States imports from Venezuela, representing roughly 3 percent of American demand. The United States also exports roughly 100,000 barrels of light oil to Venezuela daily; it is used for blending so heavy oil can be transported through pipelines to refineries and export terminals. Purchases of Venezuelan oil by American companies would be released once Pdvsa is controlled by a government led by Mr. Guaid\u00f3, officials said. Generally, American citizens will be barred from engaging in transactions with the company, although the Treasury Department said it would issue licenses to permit certain transactions and activities within specific time periods. Mr. Mnuchin said refineries in the United States could continue to process the oil, and Venezuelan oil that is already at sea could continue to its destination. Additionally, he said, the Treasury Department has issued licenses to some European and Caribbean countries so they can make a proper transition as the sanctions take effect. Pdvsa\u2019s American subsidiary Citgo, which operates three refineries, sends Venezuela gasoline and other refined petroleum products. Under the sanctions, Citgo will be allowed to continue operating, and any money it would send to Pdvsa will go into a designated account, Mr. Mnuchin said.\n. . . \nRisa Grais-Targow, an analyst of Latin American affairs at Eurasia Group, said it appeared that Pdvsa could no longer export oil to American refineries. That would force the company to sell to Asian markets at a steep discount, she said. \u201cIt looks like a de facto embargo because Venezuela will not sell to the U.S. if it cannot collect the revenues,\u201d she said. Russ Dallen, the managing partner of Caracas Capital Markets, who specializes in the oil industry, said the United States could put money owed to Pdvsa in an account controlled by the National Assembly. Both Russia and China receive large oil shipments from Venezuela as payments of debt held by the global powers. They do not pay for the oil in cash. That has meant the half-million barrels sent to the United States daily has been a critical source of revenue and foreign currency for Mr. Maduro\u2019s government. \u201cU.S. oil exports are where Venezuela gets its cash flow,\u201d Mr. Dallen said. Any problems in that cash flow could jeopardize Citgo. In August, an American judge declared that Crystallex, a Canadian gold company whose assets were seized in a 2008 nationalization move by Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the Venezuelan president at the time, could seize Citgo assets as part of a repayment scheme. In an effort to keep control of the refinery operations, Mr. Maduro\u2019s government has used what little money it still has to pay off part of the $1.4 billion judgment. If Venezuela stops payments, Mr. Maduro could lose control of Citgo, Mr. Dallen said. Mr. Maduro seemed aware of what was at stake. \u201cWith this measure they\u2019re setting out to steal the Citgo company from all Venezuelans,\u201d he said at the diplomatic ceremony in Caracas. \u201cNo, Donald Trump. No, no, no.\u201d Francisco J. Monaldi, a Venezuelan oil expert at Rice University in Texas, compared the sanctions to a \u201cnuclear bomb.\u201d But he said the moves appeared aimed not at crippling the Venezuelan oil company, but blocking Mr. Maduro\u2019s access to the revenue. For example, the sanctions included exceptions to allow the American oil company Chevron, along with Halliburton and Schlumberger, two large oil services providers, to continue working in Venezuela. Mr. Mnuchin said he did not expect the sanctions to affect American gas prices. \u201cThere has been excess oil,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of our friends in the Middle East will be happy to make up the supply.\u201d The Trump administration has been urging fellow members of the Organization of American States to recognize Mr. Guaid\u00f3 as Venezuela\u2019s president, and has promised $20 million in food and medical aid to ease economic pain for the country\u2019s citizens. That money would presumably only go to Mr. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s government. The Venezuelan economy has collapsed under the policies by Mr. Maduro\u2019s leftist, authoritarian government, and three million Venezuelans have fled their homeland. Colombia alone has taken in at least one million refugees.\n. . . \nAdministration officials indicated that Mr. Trump was still not ruling out military intervention in his efforts to pressure Mr. Maduro to step down. \u201cThe president has made it very clear on this matter that all options are on the table,\u201d John R. Bolton, the national security adviser, told reporters while clutching a yellow notepad with a cryptic phrase scrawled on top: \u201c5,000 troops to Colombia.\u201d\n. . .\nOn Monday evening, the new Mexican ambassador to the United States, Martha B\u00e1rcena, reiterated Mexico\u2019s neutral position in a statement. Among Latin American nations, Mexico has been the most notable holdout on recognizing the government of Mr. Guaid\u00f3. \u201cWe think a third way of a peaceful solution can be found,\u201d she said. \u201cMexico has offered and is willing to help to find a solution if both parties agree on that.

The military seems to be sitting this one out; I've not read of severe repression of protest rallies.  I don't know if this is because they were told by Maduro to lay low or because they have refused to get involved.   I compare this situation to Zimbabwe & Mugabe.  Mugabe looked like the Rock of Gibraltar, but overnight he was revealed as a small lump of mud when the military put him under house arrest.  One lesson I drew from that situation was that in a severely corrupt government there is no loyalty to leaders or principles, there is only self-interest.  As soon as the sycophants surrounding Mugabe saw that Mnangagwa could offer them something more (more power, wealth, safety), Mugabe was utterly and literally abandoned overnight.   Maduro is not Chavez.  Chavez was beloved.  Maduro is considered a clown.  Maduro is an embarrassment.  He insisted on doing things on live tv to make himself appear macho (a la Putin), but invariably botched them up:  falling off a bicycle on live tv, for example.  He has run the country into the ground, and Venezuelans realize it.  Venezuelans,  even those who have profited from him,  will abandon Maduro even more rapidly than Zimbabweans abandoned Mugabe. Literally millions of Venezuelans have fled to neighboring nations and are eager to return home.  Before I started forecasting on this question, I read an article about Venezuelans in exile starting to organize to support Guaido and return. April 1st is 9 weeks away.  Nine weeks is a long time when a country is in crisis, as  Venezuela is.   If Maduro was offered a safe refuge by some nation, I think that things would resolve very quickly, especially if Guiado continues to promise amnesty to Maduro's cronies.

Trump has said the US will not call it's representatives in Venezuela and US officials have warned against military retaliation if their safety is compromised. \nRussia has warned the US not to intervene. Russia conducted military exercises off the Venezuela's coast, and along with the Venezuelan gov just four weeks ago.  China on the other hand has huge stakes on Venezuela as they had lent the country over half their loans and have made significant investments to keep oil production going.  Seems to me that Maduro's survival will largely depend on Russia's and China's position. For now, Maduro still has the upper hand as the military has pledged their support to his government and have called Guaido's declaration a coup attempt.

Dictators are generally quite good at keeping power as long as they can spread benefits to allies who help them maintain their power, so Maduro has to keep his allies rolling in the cash from oil, drugs and other illicit activities, but the danger for him is the people who are excluded from this in the military. But they face enormous challenges even if a potential coup succeeds, which may well dissuade them from doing it.
