Because it was such a localized outbreak in a rural area among just a few people the source of the virus has been identified which would further discourage any new infections. \nAlso, there are seasonal infections or spill overs of Marburg infections  which coincide with the breeding and birthing seasons of fruit bats and in particular with young juvenile bats of approximately 6 months of age. The first infection of the hunter who lived near the caves was most likely at the end of the birthing ( August, Sept.) season when the previous babies obtain the age of 6 months. In this population of juveniles the virus has been found to be high.\nhttp://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1002877"], [22132, "2017-12-03T22:12:04Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-12-03T20:26:27Z", [0.02], ""], [41680, "2017-12-03T19:00:56Z", [0.0], ""], [42055, "2017-12-03T18:39:56Z", [0.01], "It seems like an isolated outbreak of 3 cases in Uganda with no secondary infections. http://www.who.int/csr/don/15-november-2017-marburg-uganda-kenya/en/ However, the incubation period can be up to 21 days (we're past that now with these cases but there are perhaps others who would be exposed to the outbreak's natural source). http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs_marburg/en/ News has gone quiet so this is looking less likely.
