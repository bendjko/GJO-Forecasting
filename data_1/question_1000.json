First, polling indicates that Gillum has an average lead over Ron DeSantis (R) by 4.4 percentage points in major polling.

Trump holds only a slight favorability rating in the state, and his approval rating is on the decline. Polling out of Quinnipiac demonstrate that his approval rating may be as low as 44 percent, compared to an unfavorable rating of 54 percent. (https://poll.qu.edu/florida/release-detail?ReleaseID=2572) Third, RonDeSantis has a significant degree of controversy surrounding him. He has made statements that were deemed to be racist in debates against Gillum and has accepted the support of white supremacists. (https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/10/25/18022094/gillum-desantis-florida-governor-debate-racists) Lastly, young voters in Florida and others are energized to rally behind the March for Our Lives movement to elect politicians who will not take money from the NRA and will support comprehensive gun control reform (https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/22/us/politics/march-for-our-lives-gun-control.html).

Last election, I was hit with 4 sets of democrat door knockers.   Got in arguments with 2 of them.\nThis election so far:  None.  General impression:  Over the last several elections  2014:  Rick Scott, Charlie Crist 2.9 v 2.8\n2010  Rick Scott Alex Sink 2.6 vs 2.6\n2006 Charlie Crist  Jim Davis 2.5 v 2.2\n2002 Jeb Bush Bill McBride 2.9 v 2.2\n1998 Bush Buddy McCay 2.2 v 1.8 Democrats are talking about how Gillums win is a historic win - and in a sense they're right.  Over the last 40 years, the democrats have consistently the same kind of Democrat machine candidates.   And while the adulatory media fawned over them - it papered over a lot.  Such as Alex Sink was married to bill mcbride.  Such as they were all Tampa bay.   They never seemed to resonate with the public.  Charlie Crist - a republican that turned democrat - gathered more enthusiasm than any of them.  In this election, Gillum had three significant candidates splitting the mainstream vote.   Gwen Graham who suffered from being perceived as an entitlement candidate, Phillip Levine, climate change, and Dan Green carpetbagger.     Florida democrats were correctly tired of the same old thing - and the same old democrat machine.   But how much will the machine contribute to the victory of an outsider?   Perhaps the machine is growing irrelevant.  Electoral turnout was +.03;  27% percent of registered black voters would be 450,000 votes.  Gillum got 520K. \nThis doesn't show any great movement to him as part of the primary.   I do expect democrat voters to move to him in lockstep,  and I do expect the young to vote for him.  But  - his calls for a state income tax will depress turnout amid the upper and middle class as much as his youth will attract the younger.    I think as people investigate his FBI investigation, his handling of the hurricane - (previous, not current) they will also not be inspired.  Now - for the democrats on the plus side:  300K Puerto Ricans.  Huge voting block and they will vote solidly D.  Con:  Florida's economy is doing great.
