(Dec '15, & '16) December is a good time to raise rates because we are at the end of the year and can easily compare the current year to previous forecasts, as well as plainly see the health of the economy throughout the year.  They have risen rates twice in 2017. Many Federal Reserve members have indicated that a third increase this year is possible. The Fed's dot plot for 2017 shows a range between 1.25%-1.50%, which would require a rate hike to achieve that range, because the current the Federal Funds rate is 1%-1.25%. As of this writing the Federal Funds rate has been trading at 1.16%. 2017 actuals have exceeded the Fed's expectations in terms of GDP growth. Additionally, the unemployment rate is at 4.1%, which is below their expectations for 2017. And inflation will most likely settle within or come slightly short of the Fed's expectations. These 3 primary metrics monitored by the fed increase the likelihood of a rate increase in December.  Reasons not to raise rates include: Janet Yellen is generally dovish. The federal reserve officials are generally very ambiguous with their thinking. So it's very challenging to determine what they will do based on newly available data. However, given the Fed's dot plot expectations for 2017, and where they want to go in December, a rate increase is palatable.

The cyclical vs the structural mechanics of economics play an important role. He stated he will be closely looking at the data over the next 2 months.  A great process that keeps him fluid within the economy is that he calls at least 30 CEO's (did not state the industries) per month to see how the economy is churning.
