Beatriz S\u00e1nchez, a journalist and the recently formed Frente Amplio coalition\u2019s presidential candidate received over 20.27% of the popular vote in last months elections. Allejandro Guiller, the nominee from the incumbent President Michelle Machelet\u2019s centre-left coalition Fuerza de la Mayor\u00eda (New Majority), just managed to reach the second round with 22.70%. With a slight lead over the Frente Amplio, he will now face former President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era, of the centre-right coalition \u201cChile Vamos\u201d (with 36.64%), in the runoff election. The result was a big shock for the centre-right, who were expecting a stronger first round. Not only was Pi\u00f1era\u2019s 10-point lead in the polls unfounded, but Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast, a candidate from the far-right and known supporter of former dictator Pinochet, also enjoyed some electoral success (7.93%). Yet perhaps the biggest losers on 19th November were the pollsters who, as in many other popular votes around the world, are seeing their credibility vanish. The Frente Amplio is a great contrast to the fossilised leadership of the country\u2019s traditional political coalitions. Yet it is the gains made by the Frente Amplio in both the parliamentary and the presidential elections that are of real significance. With their electoral successes (winning 20 deputies out of a possible 150), the coalition now holds the balance of power in the Parliament, together with the regionalist and independence parties. This means that their support will be necessary for the new president, elected from the second round on 17th December, to form a majority in parliament.\nhttps://www.opendemocracy.net/democraciaabierta/CIVICUS/sebasti-n-vielmas/chiles-frente-amplio-brings-surprises No matter who wins the election, the left will hold power in Chile.

Central to my forecast are three questions: 1. Does Sanchez's voters follow her lead and vote for Guillier? \n2. Will Guiller make concessions to Sanchez's party coalition?\n3. How many voters will go to the ballot boxes in the end? While I believe that her public endorsement will have an influence on the vote, I'm still a bit sceptical if it leads Guillier to a win. That is mostly because of the overall voter turnout. In the first round voter turnout was 46,7%. In the last election in 2013 the turnout dropped from 49% in the first round to 42% in the second round. My assumption is that the endorsement may not only mobilize leftist voters for Guillier but also conservative voters for Pinera as well (well, that's an unsourced guess based on 'recent' elections in western countries, thus, may not be the case in Chile). As it's probable that some voters still do not decide to vote for Guiller (Sanchez's party coalition contains 14 different groups that made demands to Guiller for official support before but he didn't give in), Pinera may still win the vote. If Guiller should decide to comply with demands of Sanchez's party coalition I will have to change my estimate again. Until then it seems more probable that Pinera wins.

The 2017 Presidential primary showed the lowest turnout in history (Wikipedia) at 13% of the voting age population compared to 23% for the same first round election in 2013.

We expect these parties to gain seats in congress in the general elections, benefitting from Chile's new electoral rules. This will further fracture the left-wing of Chilean politics, preventing a unified opposition to the CV. Moreover, we note that the greatest challenge to Pi\u00f1era's candidacy will come not from the political mainstream but rather from independent leftist candidate Alejandro Guillier, who received 20.0% support in recent polling, in addition to the highest confidence ratings of any candidate. While not our core scenario, we cannot rule out the possibility that Guillier defeats Pi\u00f1era, particularly if persistent gridlock further amplifies public anger towards the political establishment ( see 'Ascendant Left Wing Will Weigh On Reforms', August 23). While it is difficult to project what a Guillier administration would look like at this stage, it is likely that it would pursue increases in public spending and pro-labour reforms, to the detriment of the stable, business-friendly reputation Chile has cultivated in recent decades. That said, we note that a Guillier administration would face strong resistance from the right and centre-left elements of Chile's Congress, limiting the administration's ability to pass legislation.\" Business interests, clearly motivated in this election face populist anger however split and diluted among a greater number of parties.

My guess is current leaders are arrogant enough to think they can still sell this with themselves at the helm, rather than endorse a new guy. -20% - population seems to dislike corruption issues based on literary themes, past history and seem to favor egalitarian distribution policies. Conservative coalition has history of graft, corruption, bribery charges, etc. (probably the other side does too but it's the conservative egress in the news right now). -10% -Current areas of popular discontent seem to be around education and retirement - caring for young and old (liberal platform) and not around economic growth/trade (conservative). -20% - Pinera, and Ossandon seem to be, how to say, a bit behind the times when it comes to equality of gender, sexual orientation, and economic-socio disparities? This is at the country of Isabel Allende but strong male image works in many elections  +10% - public ongoing protests - for everyone that risks physical harm by protesting out in the open, there are likely scores more who are dissatisfied but stay home who will exercise their opinion with their vote. -20% -Pinera  said he will completely separate his role as president and abandon \"any legitimate interest of a private nature,\" This was also a point of controversy during his first presidency. I believe he plans to do this the way donald trump has with his empire: legally sign paperwork saying he's not the head but he knows in practice with a wide-ranging empire, it is impossible to not be involved to a great but indirect degree.
