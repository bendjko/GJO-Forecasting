See Anneinak Oct 5, 2015 11:22AM\n8) Vote in Iran was apparently incredibly contentious.  see Morrell  Oct 14, 2015 08:46AM\n9) Iran is pushing the envelope on the issue of missile technology sanctions. see cmeinel Oct 22, 2015 12:01PM\n10) Compliance without dispute is weakness. see fifty-sixty Oct 25, 2015 05:34AM\n11)  Iran is full of suspicious sites. IAEA probably doesn't want to visit them all, but one is enough. see fifty-sixty Oct 25, 2015 05:34AM NO arguments:\n1) the Ayatollah supports the agreement.  see cmeinel Oct 21, 2015 05:13PM\n2) Iran will be trying to get the agreement implemented quickly. A dispute could potentially delay implementation, so prior to implementation day Iran may be more likely to reach quick agreements with the IAEA. see Morrell Oct 4, 2015 09:10PM\n3) before July?  The most difficult negotiations towards the end seemed to focus on notice and ground rules for inspections, having disputes that rise to this level by this date are the uncertainty, not the seeming inevitability of disputes. see thomas.ivor Oct 25, 2015 10:55AM\n4) In addition to the politics, inspectors will need to be sure they are right, because if they get it wrong on the first one and number 2 will be a problem.  see Clinton Oct 5, 2015 05:29AM\n5) everyone will be playing nice for a while.  see NickLutz Oct 5, 2015 08:55AM\n6) the West will take great pains to keep such a referral from happening, because 1) it can be interpreted as a failure of the West to negotiate the treaty properly (a controversy especially to be avoided in the U.S. during a presidential election) and 2) what if the Joint Commission rules against Iran on an issue, and Iran rejects the ruling, and does what it wants anyway? The sanctions against Iran are supposed to be completely eradicated by the end of 2015. Once the sanctions are rolled back, I think they will be extremely difficult to reimpose and I don't think \"snapback\" will work in any meaningful fashion. So my thinking is that by the middle of next year, Iran will pretty much be able to dig in its heels on any issue it chooses, and the West will have to mollify Iran. Thus in the event of any dispute, everyone will compromise rather than refer the dispute to the Joint Commission. see rjfmgy Oct 14, 2015 10:28AM\n7) both parties have a lot to gain by following the rules and a lot to lose by breaking them. . . in the two years they were talking, Kerry and Zarif talked about what their respective governments would say publicly and what that would really mean in practice. This is a fifteen-year deal. More than half the people now in the various governments will be gone by then. Only the paper and the processes it spawns survives. Kerry knew there were guys like Cotton and Cruz going into this thing. Zarif knew about his equivalents. Each of them had to satisfy the other that the agreement would survive those kinds of attacks, and part of that was teaching each other how to interpret extreme statements from legislators to their constituencies. see Walt Oct 15, 2015 01:14PM\n8) All parties currently in position want it to appear to be working at the beginning, so as to increase their credibility and position themselves for later conflict. see JPax Oct 26, 2015 11:29AM\n9) there is a definite process to obtain access. see redacted Oct 17, 2015 03:12AM UTC\n10) in this initial stage, the people that negotiated this deal will still be in position to resolve any issue. More importantly, most experts believe that this was a good deal for both sides.  see amashal Oct 25, 2015 08:55AM\n11) the IAEA are not \u201cgotcha\u201d people. If they knew of a site or potential problem, they would have been upfront about addressing it with Iran. The IAEA has high standards to uphold, but they have also shown respect for Iran and sensitivity to the difficult situation within Iran. They have allowed flexibility to give Iran political cover at home. Maintaining this balance is crucial, so the IAEA would be very careful about using intelligence withheld by a government and then brought forward now that Iran has accepted the deal as a means to sabotage it.\nsee Scholar&Cat Oct 31, 2015 06:12AM Pivotal issues:\n1) \"Iran will be required to grant access to the IAEA to investigate suspicious sites or allegations of a covert enrichment facility, conversion facility, centrifuge production facility, or yellowcake production facility anywhere in the country\". . . . is the IAEA going to ask to go to a military site before 1 July 2016. see Clinton Oct 5, 2015 05:29AM\n2) it takes about 2 weeks for a minor issue to escalate to a dispute, so we may be able to see a problem brewing\n3) closing date of this question Bottomline is I think that during this time frame every effort will be made to prevent something becoming an official dispute.

I think the real question here is not whether there will be disputes; I'm sure there will be, and I'm sure Iran will be intransigent over inspections as other forecasters have pointed out. The question as posed is, \"Will any disputes... be referred to the Joint Commission before 1 July 2016?\" This is an entirely different matter. I think the west will take great pains to keep such a referral from happening, because 1) it can be interpreted as a failure of the west to negotiate the treaty properly (a controversy especially to be avoided in the U.S. during a presidential election) and 2) what if the Joint Commission rules against Iran on an issue, and Iran rejects the ruling, and does what it wants anyway? The sanctions against Iran are supposed to be completely eradicated by the end of 2015. Once the sanctions are rolled back, I think they will be extremely difficult to reimpose and I don't think \"snapback\" will work in any meaningful fashion. So my thinking is that by the middle of next year, Iran will pretty much be able to dig in its heels on any issue it chooses, and the west will have to mollify Iran.

So - possible that the deal will get to implementation day prior to the end of this question (mid-Oct start of arrangements + 8 mos =mid-June). Expectation is that Iran will be trying to get the agreement implemented quickly.  A dispute could potentially delay implementation, so prior to implementation day Iran may be more likely to reach quick agreements with the IAEA.  But perhaps this expectation is incorrect, or incomplete, as some in Iran might not want the agreement implementation to go smoothly/quickly. Iran has blocked access before and it seems likely that an access dispute will at some point arise and reach the Joint Commission.  But, before July? For now, while I think a dispute will arise within a medium time-frame, maybe one won't by July.  If implementation day is reached more quickly than I think, need to increase probability here.
