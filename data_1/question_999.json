He\u2019s currently seeking a third term as governor of the state having one two previous elections and a recall vote in 2012. Despite Democrats best efforts Walker has continued to survive capturing around 52% of the vote each time. Walker is seen as a very divisive figure in Wisconsin with most people either supporting him or greatly disliking him there appears to be no middle ground. During Walker\u2019s tenure collective bargaining rights of public employee unions were curbed and unions almost completely busted in the state. \n\tAfter surviving a 2012 recall vote in his first term \u201cDead Man Walker\u201d still manages to elude Democratic efforts to sweep the state of Wisconsin. Walker is hoping the strength of the economy, which is doing very well in Wisconsin will secure his nomination. His opponent, Tony Evers, is the former state superintendent and is running on providing aid to school districts. Evers also champions healthcare and increase in worker wages. Walker\u2019s advantage in this race is that Tony Evers is a bland candidate running primarily on helping the teachers, which while a just cause just doesn\u2019t win over the independent voters who keep Walker in power. Another Walker advantage is that Tammy Baldwin the Democratic senator from Wisconsin is also up for reelection and is also just as divisive. If Tammy wins reelection then Walker is finished but if Walker wins it\u2019ll be razor thin for Tammy. For these reasons I believe the people of Wisconsin will reelect Walker. Walker\u2019s toughest Democrat opponent, Mahlon Mitchell, was defeated in the primary and Evers just won\u2019t be able to motivate the Democratic base to turn out for him despite an increase in voter registration this year. The economy\u2019s success will help propel Walker to a third term. Another huge indicator that Walker will win is that the Marquette poll, A Wisconsin private university poll, found that Walker was up by +1. The Marquette poll has always accurately predicted the Wisconsin elections including in 2014 when Walker was down 7 points in the general election. Regardless of who wins the vote will be around 51-49 or 52-48. https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/can-scott-walker-extend-his-winning-streak-in-wisconsin/2018/11/01/08fa359e-dde8-11e8-b732-3c72cbf131f2_story.html?utm_term=.6147e931f7df\nhttps://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2018/nov/02/tony-evers/tony-evers-claim-against-scott-walker-student-heal/\nhttps://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/in-fight-for-his-political-life-scott-walker-makes-11th-hour-proposal-on-pre-existing-conditions/ar-BBPdi4J\nhttps://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-bland-scott-walker-troy-evers-governor_us_5bd74093e4b0a8f17efab16c\n"], [43003, "2018-11-03T20:15:23Z", [0.42, 0.58, 0.0], "538m"], [43588, "2018-11-03T17:47:50Z", [0.1, 0.9, 0.0], ""], [36040, "2018-11-03T16:30:28Z", [0.48, 0.52, 0.0], ""], [60985, "2018-11-02T16:09:00Z", [0.33, 0.67, 0.0], ""], [691, "2018-11-01T18:31:26Z", [0.42, 0.58, 0.0], ""], [34886, "2018-11-01T17:14:25Z", [0.44, 0.56, 0.0], "Based on the FiveThirtyEight Governor Forecast"], [60985, "2018-11-01T16:09:14Z", [0.4, 0.6, 0.0], ""], [61119, "2018-11-01T08:05:00Z", [0.05, 0.95, 0.0], "I used the I Ching oracle (essentially a random selection).\nScott Walker: hexagram 48, line 2 \"the bucket leaks\"\nTony Evers: hexagram 36, line 4 \"penetrating the heart of darkness\""], [20504, "2018-10-31T20:03:21Z", [0.48, 0.52, 0.0], ""], [33047, "2018-10-31T12:49:07Z", [0.5, 0.5, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2018-10-31T09:47:37Z", [0.64, 0.36, 0.0], ""], [5018, "2018-10-31T00:35:55Z", [0.49, 0.51, 0.0], ""], [43588, "2018-10-30T12:22:37Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2018-10-30T12:01:16Z", [0.42, 0.58, 0.0], ""], [29680, "2018-10-28T22:53:00Z", [0.15, 0.85, 0.0], "RPC average from 10/28 to gaussian curve."], [691, "2018-10-28T11:48:54Z", [0.42, 0.58, 0.0], ""], [57797, "2018-10-28T01:03:20Z", [0.39, 0.61, 0.0], ""], [57797, "2018-10-28T01:01:48Z", [0.37, 0.63, 0.0], ""], [20156, "2018-10-27T12:55:44Z", [0.4, 0.6, 0.0], ""], [32338, "2018-10-27T07:04:46Z", [0.05, 0.95, 0.0], ""], [11335, "2018-10-26T20:44:24Z", [0.65, 0.35, 0.0], ""], [34886, "2018-10-26T15:04:54Z", [0.42, 0.58, 0.0], "Based on the FiveThirtyEight Governor Forecast"], [23006, "2018-10-25T21:18:25Z", [0.65, 0.35, 0.0], ""], [60985, "2018-10-25T15:55:00Z", [0.32, 0.68, 0.0], ""], [34725, "2018-10-25T06:40:02Z", [0.41, 0.59, 0.0], ""], [52343, "2018-10-24T20:19:12Z", [0.45, 0.55, 0.0], ""], [29054, "2018-10-24T19:35:27Z", [0.51, 0.49, 0.0], ""], [24009, "2018-10-24T15:17:12Z", [0.23, 0.77, 0.0], ""], [15100, "2018-10-24T15:15:27Z", [0.27, 0.73, 0.0], ""], [49436, "2018-10-24T15:10:36Z", [0.44, 0.48, 0.08], ""], [691, "2018-10-24T12:18:43Z", [0.48, 0.52, 0.0], ""], [14253, "2018-10-23T08:23:17Z", [0.57, 0.43, 0.0], ""], [61665, "2018-10-23T01:00:38Z", [0.46, 0.54, 0.0], ""], [57797, "2018-10-22T12:25:51Z", [0.4, 0.6, 0.0], ""], [34886, "2018-10-22T11:53:53Z", [0.4, 0.6, 0.0], "Based on the FiveThirtyEight Governor Forecast"], [34725, "2018-10-22T09:16:46Z", [0.35, 0.65, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2018-10-22T07:57:08Z", [0.65, 0.35, 0.0], ""], [43003, "2018-10-22T07:25:07Z", [0.4, 0.6, 0.0], "note to self: +4% to Dem to convert from my model to 538m."], [15196, "2018-10-22T03:51:51Z", [0.5, 0.5, 0.0], ""], [14372, "2018-10-22T03:15:22Z", [0.4, 0.6, 0.0], ""], [16501, "2018-10-21T18:33:52Z", [0.3, 0.7, 0.0], ""], [34725, "2018-10-21T13:33:38Z", [0.35, 0.65, 0.0], ""], [23006, "2018-10-21T01:21:32Z", [0.51, 0.49, 0.0], "Evers looks way more normal by comparison"], [23006, "2018-10-21T01:14:06Z", [0.51, 0.49, 0.0], ""], [691, "2018-10-20T21:26:49Z", [0.48, 0.52, 0.0], ""], [21143, "2018-10-20T15:53:34Z", [0.54, 0.45, 0.01], ""], [61639, "2018-10-20T11:00:18Z", [0.85, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [4681, "2018-10-20T03:37:29Z", [0.55, 0.45, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2018-10-19T04:24:37Z", [0.6, 0.4, 0.0], ""], [20504, "2018-10-19T03:10:49Z", [0.37, 0.63, 0.0], "Adjusting for most recent poll."], [23006, "2018-10-19T00:32:45Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [34725, "2018-10-18T06:49:52Z", [0.35, 0.65, 0.0], ""], [57797, "2018-10-17T23:25:50Z", [0.45, 0.55, 0.0], ""], [705, "2018-10-17T20:31:33Z", [0.35, 0.65, 0.0], "The 538 Governors Forecast was released a couple hours ago.
