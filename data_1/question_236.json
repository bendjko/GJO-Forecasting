First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was putting on hold plans to introduce legislation that would have demanded a second referendum. Sturgeon, whose Scottish National Party wants to break Scotland's 300-year-old union with England, had been seeking a referendum in late 2018 or early 2019, ahead of Britain's EU exit which is due in March 2019. \"We will not seek to introduce the legislation for an independence referendum immediately,\" Sturgeon told the Scottish parliament. \"The Scottish government will reset the plan I set out.\" She later told the BBC she believed that meant another secession vote, if it took place, would most likely be before 2021 when the current Scottish legislative term ends (para. 1-5). Sturgeon's party lost 21 of its 56 seats in the United Kingdom's parliament at Westminster in the June 8 election. In the days after the election she acknowledged that her insistence on a second independence referendum had lost the SNP votes (para 7). Sturgeon told the Scottish assembly she had listened carefully to those who were concerned about Brexit but had not wanted another independence vote immediately and were worried about a lack of political clarity. She said a choice needed to be offered, but the timing needed to be more cautious (para 17). \"The Scottish government remains committed strongly to the principle of giving Scotland a choice at the end of this process but I want to reassure people that our proposal is not for a referendum now, or before there is sufficient clarity about the options,\" Sturgeon said (para 17-18).

The poll also showed Theresa May's Conservatives due to win more seats in Scotland in the upcoming election than it has held for decades, rising to eight seats by taking seven from Nicola Sturgeon's Scottish National Party (SNP). The survey also showed a decline in the approval ratings of Sturgeon herself, who leads the devolved Scottish government She has argued that another independence referendum is necessary because Scots voted to keep their EU membership last June and they now face Brexit. But 49 percent of Scots are against a referendum being held between the autumn of 2018 and the spring of 2019 - the timetable she has proposed. Some 37 percent supported this timetable, while 14 percent did not know. YouGov found the Conservatives gaining traction as they become the preferred party of those who defend a United Kingdom over Scottish independence. Sturgeon's party would still easily be the biggest party representing Scotland with 49 of the 59 seats assigned to it in Britain's 650-seat national parliament. But the survey of 1,017 people between April 24 and 27 also showed the leader of the SNP at Westminster, Angus Robertson, losing his Moray seat for the first time since 2001.

Scotland, where a majority voted to stay in the EU though the United Kingdom as a whole voted to leave at a June referendum, last December proposed a separate trade carve-out for itself in London's upcoming divorce talks with the EU. The core of Scotland's proposal is for it to remain fully within the EU's single market for goods and services, whereas British Prime Minister Theresa May wants to take the UK out of it to restore control over immigration. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says May's government has not taken the proposals seriously, and she wants a new vote on independence from Britain before its expected March 2019 exit from the EU. \"There are clear barriers to making your proposals a reality,\" Davis said in a photocopy of the letter dated March 29 and addressed to Michael Russell, the Scottish minister for UK negotiations on Scotland's place in Europe. Russell published the correspondence despite a request from May's government not to do so. \"Scotland's accession to the EFTA and then the EEA would not be deliverable and, importantly, would require the consent of all EFTA and EU member states,\" Davis wrote. The European Free Trade Association and European Economic Area include non-EU states Norway, Switzerland, Iceland and Liechtenstein. \"Any divergence between EU and UK law - as a result, perhaps, of new EU regulation - could lead to the creation of new barriers to trade within our Union,\" Davis said. \"DISRUPTION\" He added that it could create potential \"significant disruption to the internal UK market\". The letters offer some insight into the British government's thinking on a separate deal for Scotland after its vote to remain in the EU, as well as the strained relations between London and Edinburgh (para. 1-10).

Scots voted by a wide margin to stick with the European Union in last June's referendum, clashing with the UK as a whole which voted to leave. Scotland's devolved government, run by the Scottish National Party (SNP), says this means the country should be given a new chance to decide whether it wants to split from the UK. The central government in London opposes this. The Brexit issue does not appear to have given wings to the independence movement, according to Kantar's survey of 1,060 adults carried out after Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called for a referendum to be held in autumn 2018 or spring 2019. Of those interviewed, only 26 percent thought an independence vote should be held on either of those dates, while 18 percent thought it should take place later. But 46 percent thought there should be no referendum at all. The issue is center-stage in Scotland ahead of a UK-wide election on June 8. Kantar found that of those who said they would be certain to vote in any independence referendum, 55 percent would vote against it, while 37 percent would vote in favor and another 8 percent were undecided (para. 1-7).

Borland (2017) April 24, states that: One survey found that one in three Scots is preparing to vote for Ruth Davidson\u2019s resurgent Conservatives, which would see the party win 12 MPs and unseat a host of SNP big names. The Panelbase survey for the Sunday Times showed the Nationalists down to a 44 per cent share of the vote, although that would still leave Nicola Sturgeon as the biggest party with 46 MPs. In contrast, Labour would be wiped out north of the Border and any hopes of a Lib Dem revival would falter with only Alistair Carmichael retaining his berth in Orkney and Shetland If the Panelbase poll is accurate, it would see the Tories record their best Scottish result since 1983 when Michael Foot was Labour leader. The Nationalist MPs to lose their seats would include Westminster leader Angus Robertson in Moray and controversial Perth and North Perthshire MP Pete Wishart. Another poll, by Survation for the Sunday Post, puts the SNP on 43 per cent, with the Conservatives on 28 per cent, Labour on 18 per cent and the Lib Dems on nine per cent. Under this scenario, the Nationalists would retain 47 seats with the Tories on eight, the Lib Dems with three and Labour hanging on to one. Several other newspapers, including the Sunday Express and the Observer, also published opinion polls with smaller Scottish samples pointing to a major Tory revival. The poll figures appeared to rattle Ms Sturgeon, who issued a strongly-worded press release ramping up the SNP\u2019s anti-Conservative rhetoric to a new level. She said: \u201cThe election in Scotland is a two-horse race between the SNP and hard-line Tories. The Tories have taken an extreme position \u2013 demanding an end to any opposition at Westminster if they win the election. \u201cThe more Tory MPs there are, the heavier the price Scotland will pay. They\u2019re already cutting nearly \u00a33billion from the Scottish budget. \u201cThey\u2019re hitting family incomes hard by cutting and removing child tax credits.

Despite claiming that voting SNP was the best way to keep Tories away from power in councils, the First Minister declined to say that she would ban her councilors from forming coalitions with Ruth Davidson\u2019s party. At her manifesto launch in Wester Hailes, Edinburgh, Ms Sturgeon said there was a \u201cdanger\u201d of Tories being propped up by Labour in local authorities, but stopped short of ruling out SNP/Tory deals. In the past Ms Sturgeon\u2019s party has worked with the Tories in local government with a Conservative/SNP coalition running East Ayrshire. Ms Sturgeon said: \u201cThere is a danger either through people voting Tory or Labour potentially looking at coalitions with the Tories to keep themselves in power in the council chambers that we do in this election see local services slipping into Tory hands and I think that would be disastrous for the services that local councils are responsible for. My message is a very clear, straight message, if you want to vote to protect local services then vote SNP.\u201d But when asked if she was going to ban East Ayrshire SNP from going into coalition with the Tories again, Ms Sturgeon said: \u201cI want to see SNP councils and with the greatest of respect, I am going to campaign for the remainder of the campaign to get as many votes for the SNP and as many SNP councils.\u201d When pressed further on whether the SNP would countenance coalition with the Tories, the First Minister again declined to answer the question directly. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see the Tories in council chambers,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see the Tories with their hands on local services. My message is crystal clear - vote SNP. We have got an election in under two weeks\u2019 time and the way to keep Tories out of local councils is to vote SNP. \u201cAnybody that looks at the relationships between the SNP and the Tories right would think that is hugely unlikely. \u201cMy main message is to vote SNP to make sure that you get SNP councillors running councils.\u201d With Labour lagging far behind the Conservatives in UK-wide polling, Ms Sturgeon conceded it was likely Theresa May would return to Downing Street after the 8 June snap election (para. 1-3).

May's decision to call a June 8 election stunned her political rivals this week and a string of polls released late on Saturday suggested the gamble had paid off, with one from ComRes showing the party of Margaret Thatcher enjoying levels of support not seen since 1991. May, appointed prime minister in the turmoil that followed Britain's vote to leave the European Union last June, said she needed the election to secure her own mandate and strengthen her hand for the Brexit negotiations ahead. She is also looking to capitalize on the disarray swirling around the Labour party, which has been riven with internal division over its leader Jeremy Corbyn. Voters also appear to be switching from the anti-EU UKIP party, which helped campaign for Brexit, to May's Conservatives, which will likely deliver it. \"The announcement of a snap election has clearly focused the minds of the electorate,\" said James Crouch at pollster Opinium. In two other polls, May's Conservatives also gained ground in Scotland at the expense of the Scottish National Party, potentially weakening the nationalists' demand for another independence referendum (para. 1-6).

McCafferty (2017) 18 April, states that: The SNP might have been quick off the block with their reaction to Theresa May\u2019s \u201cstrategic mistake\u201d of calling a General Election, but they were certainly taken by surprise. Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s party had previously agitated for the Prime Minister to seek a mandate to govern, but it doesn\u2019t appear they were on a war footing as Britain prepares to go to the polls on June 8. The First Minister has been angling for the permission to hold a second referendum on Scottish independence, but thus far, Mrs May has shown a reluctance to do so. Ms Sturgeon\u2019s party won 56 of the available 59 seats at the election in 2015, although two have subsequently left the SNP. But will winning another near clean-sweep mean Nicola Sturgeon has the mandate that she so desires to hold another vote on Scotland\u2019s constitutional future? We look at how this might affect the Indyref2 issue. UD-Aye? The thorny issue of a Unilateral Declaration of Independence has been floating around some of the more eccentric fringes of the nationalist movement even before the referendum of 2014. While it has become synonymous with outlandish activists, that doesn\u2019t mean that it is a policy that is entirely off the agenda. In fact, declaring independence if the an anti-Union party won a majority of Scottish seats at a UK general election was SNP party policy until relatively recently. Alex Salmond, in one of his first interviews after stepping down as First Minister, said that a referendum was just \u2018one of a number of routes\u2019 Scotland could take to gain independence. He was backed up by former SNP Deputy Leader Jim Sillars, who wanted UDI to be enacted if there was an SNP majority at the 2016 Scottish Elections. That unsurprisingly didn\u2019t make the party\u2019s manifesto, and in any case they were deprived of an overall majority (para. 1-12). McCafferty, R. (2017).

We are just days into the fight, officially the election hasn\u2019t even started yet but, here, it has already turned into a referendum on the Tories. Or, if you\u2019re a Tory, it\u2019s about a referendum on Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s referendum. The First Minister has already set out her approach to the big vote. On Thursday, she made it clear that nobody \u2013 least of all Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale \u2013 really believes that Jeremy Corbyn can become Prime Minister. When the Labour Party is 20 points behind the Conservatives in the polls and trailing even in Scotland, it would take something more than a miracle for Theresa May to lose the vote (para. 1-6). She says a massive Tory majority means a stifling of dissent across the country in general and at Holyrood in particular (para 9). Meanwhile the Tories are rallying support by saying that a vote for them will send a message that Scotland doesn\u2019t want another referendum. It seems a bit of a waste of time since Mrs. May has already refused to allow another vote. And, anyway, that\u2019s not all a vote for the Conservatives will mean. Just as Nicola Sturgeon will take an SNP win as an endorsement for her referendum plans, Theresa May will count every Tory vote as backing for her hard Brexit proposals, anti-immigrant policies, welfare cuts like the Bedroom Tax and the Rape Clause and further rolling back of the pension age just in case anybody lives long enough to claim it (para 9-12).

Scotland voted against independence in 2014, but voted to remain in the European Union in 2016 while the United Kingdom as a whole voted to quit the bloc. Sturgeon says this means Scotland should have another chance to vote on secession. \"If the SNP wins this election in Scotland and the Tories (Conservatives) don't, then Theresa May's attempt to block our mandate to give the people of Scotland a choice over their own future when the time is right will crumble to dust,\" Sturgeon told reporters in London. The Scottish parliament last month backed Sturgeon's bid to hold a new referendum in 2018 or 2019, but May rejected the proposal.

Scotland voted against independence in 2014, but voted to remain in the European Union in 2016 while the United Kingdom as a whole voted to quit the bloc. Sturgeon says this means Scotland should have another chance to vote on secession. \"If the SNP wins this election in Scotland and the Tories (Conservatives) don't, then Theresa May's attempt to block our mandate to give the people of Scotland a choice over their own future when the time is right will crumble to dust,\" Sturgeon told reporters in London.

Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon defiantly declared her mandate for a second referendum was \"beyond question\" after she received formal backing by the Scottish Parliament on Tuesday. However, the U.K. government has repeatedly blocked calls for a vote until after the Brexit process is complete with Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May insistent that \"now is not the time\" (para. 1-4). In 2014, Scotland voted to maintain its more than 300 year old union with the U.K. by 55 percent to 45 percent. However, Scottish citizens backed Remain in the EU referendum by 62 percent to 38 percent while the rest of the U.K. voted to leave (para. 8). \"It is tempting to think that Brexit is going to be so disastrous that any alternative must be better but two wrongs do not make a right and you've got to make a hard-nosed decision about it. I am sympathetic towards Scotland but then again this is not about sympathy, this is about pure economic logic,\" Angus Armstrong, director of macroeconomics at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, told CNBC in a phone interview. Sturgeon has called for Westminster to approve a second referendum between fall 2018 and spring 2019 in order to base the vote on information available deep into the two-year Brexit negotiations and therefore ultimately rectify a \"democratic deficit\". However, May argued it would cause massive economic uncertainty at the worst possible time for Britain. \"Quite simply, Scotland exports two-thirds of its goods to the U.K. which is around four times as much as it does to the EU and you'd have to say it is clearly more damaging to pull out of the U.K. based purely on that measure,\" Armstrong added. A hard border between Scotland and the U.K. would certainly appear to have a negative impact for the country should the country look to sever ties with its largest trading partner. Scotland can no longer boast bumper oil revenues as it could in 2014, nor can it point to significantly higher levels of GDP in comparison to the U.K. yet Brexit, and perhaps even more notably, a so-called \"hard-Brexit\" without EU single market access has dramatically changed the argument (para. 8-14). In the event Scotland was able to host a second independence referendum and if its citizens then voted to leave the U.K., the European Commission has said an independent state would need to apply for EU membership. The process is long and arduous and the European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker has said no more states would be admitted until at least 2020 (para. 17). Meredith, S. (2017).

Now 46, she served loyally for a decade as deputy to Alex Salmond, both in the Scottish National Party and later in government, before becoming Scotland\u2019s leader after the failure of the independence referendum of September 2014, when Mr. Salmond resigned. Now, after Britain as a whole voted to leave the European Union while Scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain, Ms. Sturgeon is patiently laying out a path for another independence referendum, using Prime Minister Theresa May as her foil. \u201cThe U.K. government has decided to remove Scotland not just from the European Union but from the single market as well, and that\u2019s clearly against the will of the majority of people who live here,\u201d she said Friday, as she sent a formal letter to Mrs. May, with the support of the Scottish Parliament, asking for another referendum. Mrs. May has already said the referendum cannot happen before Britain leaves the European Union, two years from now (para. 1-4). A second referendum would probably put the independence camp in a better position than three years ago, when young people voted heavily to leave, and a British exit from the European Union seemed highly unlikely. But while Scots voted to remain in the European Union last June by 62 percent to 38 percent, that has not translated easily into support for independence, with about a third of those favoring independence also voting for a British exit (para. 11). \u201cRight now there\u2019s too much uncertainty, not just about Scotland but about Brexit,\u201d said Ian Ramage, who returned to Edinburgh a decade ago after many years living abroad. \u201cBrexit to me is like going back in time, but nobody\u2019s certain about anything just now.\u201d  Chris Deerin, a Scottish political analyst, said that Ms. Sturgeon \u201cis both stuck and in charge.\u201d She would not want another referendum so soon in any case, he said, and can now blame Mrs. May and Westminster, always a popular tactic here. But for Ms. Sturgeon, it would be important to try to have the vote before the next Scottish parliamentary elections in 2021, when the now-dominant S.N.P. might lose more seats, in the normal cycle of politics (para. 11-13). Since 2014, Scotland\u2019s oil and gas revenues have plunged precipitously, from some 9.6 billion pounds in the 2011-2012 fiscal year to just 60 million pounds in 2015-2016. And it may shrink further given the high costs of extraction while the price of oil is low.

So this question can be resolved as yes under two scenarios: (1) the UK and Scottish governments agree on a Section 30 text and Holyrood sets a date, or (2) the Scottish (government or parliament) sets a date for a non-binding referendum. The chances of (1) by July 1 are slim but not zero - after the 69-59 vote, stubbornly opposing the will of the Scottish parliament may be seen as deeply undemocratic. The chances of (2) are higher, but not overwhelming either - a non-binding vote may be seen as a way to put pressure on the UK government to agree on Section 30, but also comes with the risk of low participation that might validate the UK's resistance. The most likely outcome seems continuing discussions, but no resolution by July 1. But if Theresa May agrees in principle to the idea of a referendum, Sturgeon can wait a bit for the date.

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has today written to the Prime Minister to begin early discussions to allow a referendum on independence to take place. It comes after the Scottish Parliament voted to give the Scottish Government a mandate for a Section 30 order under the Scotland Act 1998 to enable a referendum. The full text of the letter is below. Dear Theresa When we met in Glasgow on Monday, I wished you well for the negotiations that lie ahead now that you have formally invoked Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. I want to reiterate those good wishes now. I very much hope that you succeed in realising your ambitions for the terms of the UK's future relationship with the EU. A good deal for the UK is clearly in Scotland's interests whatever constitutional future we choose. It is for that reason that I intend that the Scottish Government will play a full and constructive role in securing such an outcome. I expressed my frustration on Monday that the process leading up to the invoking of Article 50 had failed to involve the devolved administrations in any meaningful way - a view that I know is shared by the First Minister of Wales. Far from securing a UK wide approach ahead of invoking Article 50 - as you committed to do last July - the voices of the devolved administrations were largely ignored and all attempts at compromise rejected, in most cases with no prior consultation. As we move forward into a new phase, we need to agree a more direct role and influence for the devolved administrations, reflecting the key interests that are at stake for all of us. However, whatever outcome is secured, it seems inevitable that it will remove the UK, not just from the EU, but also from the single market. As you are aware, that is not an outcome that the people of Scotland voted for. It is also an outcome that will have significant implications for our economy, society and place in the world. In these very changed circumstances, the people of Scotland must have the right to choose our own future - in short, to exercise our right of self determination.  Indeed I noted the importance you attached to the principle of self determination in your letter to President Tusk.  As you are aware, the Scottish Parliament has now determined by a clear majority that there should be an independence referendum. The purpose of such a referendum is to give people in Scotland the choice of following the UK out of the EU and single market on the terms you negotiate, or becoming an independent country, able to chart our own course and build a genuine partnership of equals with the other nations of the UK. A copy of the motion passed by Parliament on 28 March 2017 is attached. The decision of the Scottish Parliament has been made in line with the tradition of popular sovereignty in Scotland - that the people of Scotland should be able to determine the form of government most suited to their needs - and with the clear commitment in the manifesto on which my government was re-elected last May. I am therefore writing to begin early discussions between our governments to agree an Order under section 30 of the Scotland Act 1998 that would enable a referendum to be legislated for by the Scottish Parliament. I have, of course, noted and carefully considered your public position. However, it seems that we are in agreement on the essential matters. For example we agree that now is not the time for a referendum. You confirmed to me on Monday, and repeated in your letter invoking Article 50, that you intend the terms of both the UK's exit from the EU and of a future trade deal to be agreed before March 2019 and in time for ratification by other member states - in other words, between the autumn of next year and the spring of 2019. As you are aware, this is the timescale endorsed by the Scottish Parliament for a referendum. As I have said previously, if the timetable you have set out changes, we will require to consider the implications for the timing of a referendum. However, it seems reasonable at this stage to work on the basis of your stated timetable. We are also in agreement that - unlike the EU referendum - the choice must be an informed one. That means that both the terms of Brexit and the implications and opportunities of independence must be clear in advance of the referendum. It is also worth noting that the clear precedent of the 2012 Edinburgh Agreement should make reaching agreement on this occasion a relatively straightforward process - addressing any concern you may have that discussions would be time consuming for your government when they are also preparing for EU negotiations. In light of the above, there appears to be no rational reason for you to stand in the way of the will of the Scottish Parliament and I hope you will not do so. However, in anticipation of your refusal to enter into discussions at this stage, it is important for me to be clear about my position. It is my firm view that the mandate of the Scottish Parliament must be respected and progressed. The question is not if, but how. I hope that will be by constructive discussion between our governments. However, if that is not yet possible, I will set out to the Scottish Parliament the steps I intend to take to ensure that progress is made towards a referendum. Again, I wish you well for all that lies ahead and stand ready to discuss both a section 30 order and the Scottish Government's role in securing the best outcome for all parts of the UK.

Sturgeon said the meeting had been businesslike and cordial but that there had been no guarantees from May that any powers coming back to the UK from the EU would be devolved onto Scotland. \"I had been under the impression ... that she was coming to offer something in the way of more powers (for Scotland),\" she told the BBC. \"It turned out that wasn't the case.\" There was no immediate comment on the talks from May's Downing Street office.

Nick Robinson was interviewing Aileen Campbell, Scottish Health Minister, who had come on air to crow about the SNP government\u2019s generosity in announcing it would fund three free cycles of IVF treatment for Scottish couples desirous of having a family. Robinson un-generously chose to rain on her parade: instead of writhing in mute admiration of this taxpayer-funded largesse he pointed out that this commitment would cost \u201cmany millions\u201d at a time when a Glasgow maternity hospital had to turn away expectant mothers, Scotland was missing A&E targets and the BMA had described the Scottish NHS as \u201cnear breaking point\u201d (para. 1-2). Yeah, right on, Ms. Campbell, that needed saying. Sassenach journalists need to learn that SNP spokes folk do not go on the air to be interrogated about unhelpful topics such as crises in maternity hospitals and A&E, or meltdown in Scottish education, now trailing Vietnam in some subjects. If crude metropolitan broadcasters want access to SNP ministers, they had better learn the rules of the game. An interview should not be abused as an opportunity to hold a minister to account; it is essentially the broadcast version of a triumphalist press release advertising the latest expenditure by the Scottish state on progressive objectives (para. 6). constitutional preoccupation in a tunnel vision that precludes her addressing the everyday issues of government has too long been ignored. The SNP has lacked political opposition or even interrogation by the media. Why govern when you can grandstand? The SNP came to power on a programme of deception; its power is now imminently dissolving in a welter of self-delusion (para. 9). The referendum loss of 2014 signaled the beginning of the end. The SNP refused to acknowledge the peril in which it stood and convinced itself Brexit would provoke a terminal Scottish alienation from the UK. Within days of Article 50 being triggered, the latest opinion polls on independence stand as follows: YouGov Yes 43%, No 57%; Panelbase Yes 44%, No 51%. So much for the Brexit boost to independence. In a fit of post-referendum realism, Nicola Sturgeon committed herself to a self-denying ordinance whereby she would refrain from calling for a second independence referendum until support for separatism had stood at 60% for a minimum of twelve months. Yet, instead, this month she announced her desire to hold a second referendum in 2018-19, just when the Brexit negotiations would be at their most problematic. The calculation that an electorate that rejected a leap in the dark in the more stable conditions of 2014 would be game for a much greater gamble at the height of Brexit uncertainty is, to say the least, ill-founded. That piece of gesture politics has badly damaged Sturgeon\u2019s dwindling credibility. She compromised that crucial credibility in order to indulge in the playground politics of wrong-footing Theresa May for 10 days. In Scotland, more and more people are beginning to ask what the hell has happened to their key public services, notably health and education, on the SNP\u2019s watch. That re-focus on bread-and-butter issues is potentially lethal to the SNP. How can they blame England for Scottish woes wholly devolved into their responsibility? The slide is, so far, undramatic but evident. The SNP is now a minority government sustained by fruitcake Greens, at a time when, globally, the green tide is receding on a wave of skepticism. In the interests of the UK Theresa May has a duty to postpone a destabilizing Scottish independence referendum until Brexit has bedded in. That probably means until after the next Scottish elections when policy chickens coming home to roost are likely to put the SNP out of power, after which the tedious \u201cindyref\u201d obsession will be off the political radar (para. 9-13).

States that: Even for a party largely dismissive of contrary views, the flood of economic analysis and forecasts that point to a hard entrance to independence cannot be forever ignored. Andrew Wilson, a former member of the Scottish parliament, will present a report from his Growth Commission in a few weeks: he has denied saying privately that it would take up to 10 years for the Scottish economy to recover from achieving independence, as widely reported. But both the rhetoric and policy are shifting. Former SNP leader Alex Salmond has floated the idea of creating a new Scots currency, free floating or pegged to sterling \u2014 thus abandoning the present policy of retaining the pound. At the same time, the previously enthusiastic embrace of the EU (which remains party policy) is now diluted by discreet talk of other alternatives, such as membership of the European Economic Area. The EEA\u2019s members include Norway, much admired in the SNP; it offers free trade within the EU single market, providing the market\u2019s laws and regulations are adopted. EEA membership does not include membership of the common fisheries and agricultural policies, attractive to a Scotland whose fisheries have suffered in recent years. None of these voices off surfaced in Ms Sturgeon\u2019s speech. The slogan is no longer \u201cIt\u2019s our oil!\u2019 but \u201cIt\u2019s our democracy!\u201d The dismissal by Theresa May, UK prime minister, of Ms Sturgeon\u2019s proposal for a second referendum on independence in 2018 or 2019, around the time when the Brexit terms will be known but the negotiations not yet concluded, has given the first minister a call to arms. The decision on the timing of the referendum will be a Scottish, not a British, decision, she insists (para. 1-3). But the shadow over the heart waits offstage. Oil, in its heyday, provided about 7 per cent of Scottish gross domestic product: it now provides 0.1 per cent. In 2015-16, the country spent nearly \u00a315bn more than it raised, a 9.5 per cent share of GDP, producing a fiscal gap more than double the 4 per cent for the UK (para. 7). On present trends, an independent Scotland would face cuts and tax rises. The efforts of the SNP leadership to shift attention to the supposed devastation Brexit would wreak are understandable as a political ploy, but increasingly transparent as only that. Scotland\u2019s exports are growing, but four times more go to the rest of the UK than to the EU. On 2015 figures reported in January, exports to the rest of the UK were \u00a349.8bn, against \u00a312.3bn to the other 27 member states of the EU. Were independence to mean a hard border between Scotland and the UK, the economy would seem to be at greater risk. When, on Wednesday evening, Mrs. May invoked the values of democracy, freedom and the rule of law epitomized by a parliament that had just been under terrorist attack, she was stating nothing new. Rather, she was placing the outrage in a context of shared values and shared threat, which might move the Scots as much as the English (para. 7-11). Lloyd, J. (2017).

Turning Scotland, which sells two thirds of its exports to the rest of Britain, into a heavyweight international trader would be tough. This is especially so because a dive in global oil prices since Scots voted on - and rejected - independence in 2014 has hit its economy hard. With the Scottish National Party (SNP) which runs the devolved government pushing for a new referendum, opponents of dismantling the 300-year-old union say the economy can ill-afford another divisive campaign and its inherent uncertainty. But McLean says uncertainty is a given anyway as the government in London prepares to negotiate Britain's departure from the European Union after 44 years in the trading bloc. \"At the end of the uncertainty you have to think of where you want to be,\" said McLean, who sits on the advisory board of Business for Scotland, a pro-independence group. \"Independence gives us a route where the EU market is still open to us and there is a way forward for trade.

K. consumer prices rose at their fastest pace in nearly 3\u00bd years in February, spurred by the pound\u2019s steep fall after last year\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, data showed Tuesday, highlighting a potential drag to economic growth as the government prepares to formally begin Brexit divorce proceedings next week. The faster price growth could spell trouble for the U.K. economy, which defied gloomy predictions of an immediate Brexit hit last year, but which relies heavily on domestic demand. The pickup in inflation means that consumer prices are now growing at roughly the same pace as British workers\u2019 wages, meaning they may rein in spending in coming months. The breach of the BOE\u2019s target will be scrutinized by policy makers, who last week took an unexpectedly hawkish tone and telegraphed that a rate rise may not be far off should inflation continue to accelerate. But commenting on Tuesday\u2019s data, Gov. Mark Carney struck a restrained tone, saying that \u201cyou never overreact to a single data point.\u201d The British pound jumped 0.9% to $1.2468, around its highest since February, as investors bet that higher than expected inflation numbers will pressure the BOE to raise interest rates. Rising rates tend to attract foreign money looking for the extra yield, pushing up the local currency. \u201cThe market is responding by bringing forward expectations of a hike in interest rates, as well as increasing inflation expectations and a strengthening in sterling,\u201d said Mitul Patel, head of interest rates at Henderson Global Investors. The increase in the inflation rate was driven largely by rising prices for food and transport, as well as culture and recreation, the data showed, and reflects a broader global trend of inflation returning after a long spell of feeble price-growth that pushed central banks toward ever more radical stimulus measures. But the U.K.\u2019s core inflation\u2014a measure that excludes more volatile prices of products such as energy and food\u2014also jumped in February and stood at 2.0%, compared with 1.6% the previous month, signaling that the increase in the headline figure was also a result of the pound\u2019s steep depreciation after the June Brexit vote (para. 1-8).

In March, at a time when the legal details were still in the process of being worked out, such as the timing of the vote, the then First Minister, Alex Salmond, made a pre-emptive announcement of an intention to hold the independence referendum in the autumn of 2014. Negotiations on the details then continued between the two governments only concluding in October 2012 when the Edinburgh Agreement was signed (para. 1-2). On Monday 16 March 2017, the current First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, pre-empted the service of an Article 50 notice by announcing an intention to ask the UK Government to legislate for another Scottish Referendum to be held before Brexit occurs. It has quickly become, known as IndyRef2 \u2013 despite that tag reportedly being resisted by the Scottish Government - which just reinforces how a referendum debate can be difficult to tame once unleashed. The UK Government has now indicated that it does not consider that timing to be appropriate and that voters in Scotland should have the opportunity to assess how a post-Brexit UK is operating before being asked again whether they wish to leave the UK. The topic may crop up at the SNP conference this weekend (para. 6). In 2012, an order under Section 30 of the Scotland Act was a legal technical detail which no one focused on but in the new era of Brexit, even legal clause references can become \"reality TV celebrities\" in their own right. So, will Section 30 become the new Article 50 \u2013 with its own headlines and a place in common parlance? Unlikely - the public's appetite is surely sated on that front.

A parliamentary motion by Nicola Sturgeon published on Monday to pave the way for a second independence referendum makes no mention of future EU membership for an independent Scotland. Nor did Nicola Sturgeon address the question in her speech to the SNP\u2019s spring conference at the weekend. Scotland\u2019s first minister has reasons for her reticence (para. 1-2). When asked, Ms Sturgeon insists it is still SNP policy to seek EU membership. But she has been careful not to commit on how and when (para. 5).

In a radio interview, Alex Salmond, former SNP leader and first minister, suggested Scotland could first seek to join the European Free Trade Association of Norway, Switzerland, Iceland and Liechtenstein as a stepping stone to EU membership (para.12). Steering away from an immediate effort to join the EU would disappoint Scottish Europhiles, but make a renewed independence campaign less vulnerable to doubts about how welcoming the EU would be.  The SNP\u2019s promise of a seamless transition to EU membership for an independent Scotland was a major weakness in 2014, particularly after Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, then-European Commission president, declared that it would be \u201cdifficult, if not impossible\u201d. There is also the question of opposition from Spain, which fears Scottish independence would fuel its own separatist movements.  However, EU officials have already implicitly softened Mr Barroso\u2019s tough line. The European Commission\u2019s representative in the UK said last month that Scotland would have to \u201cjoin the list\u201d of countries seeking to join the EU, but made clear the process might be relatively quick (para. 12-16).

The Westminster government and Parliament are constitutionally bound to approve a Scottish referendum, which Prime Minister Theresa May has ruled out for now.

Time is short. Article 50 negotiations have to be concluded by March 2019, or else the U.K. will leave the EU without any agreement.

Let's analyze the players first:\nOn the one hand, we have Nicola Sturgeon, the scottish PM. She has been beating the \"we are leaving the UK\" drum heavily since the Brexit result. From her perspective, she has two reasons for wishing to go ahead with this quickly. \nOne: The earlier she manages to leave Britain, the more in sync Scottish law and EU law will be.\nSecond: If she manages to get a referendum quickly, she will have the highest chance of success. Since most scots voted against Brexit, the temporary emotions in all this would play in her favor. If she waits too long and Britain succeeds after leaving the EU, she would be in a much worse position. In addition, if she gets a referendum while Britain is busy with the Brexit process, she can be assured that her political opponents would be preoccupied, allowing her to campaign more easily. Next, we have Theresa May, the PM of Great Britain. She seems rather committed to following through with Brexit, and is supposed to trigger Article 50 at the end of March, 8 days from now. She, of course, must be opposed to a breakup of Britain, for the reasons outlined above. It would make bargaining with the EU harder if she doesn't know what will become of a major chunk of the British country and she would be fighting on two fronts at once. So, with this in mind, I looked into the history of things a bit...\nThe British are surprisingly lenient when it comes to referendums like this. Some countries (like Spain in the Catalan case) don't even allow (or just ignore) referendums concerning independence. However, a referendum requires several things: First, an agreement between the government of Britain and of Scotland and the approval of the parliament of Scotland.\nIn the 2014 referendum, Wikipedia states: \"The Scottish government announced on 21 March 2013 that the referendum would be held on 18 September 2014.\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_independence_referendum,_2014). Parliament of Scotland passed the bill in November of 2013. So, we can see that a referendum was announced approximately 1.5 years ahead of time. Taking this as my baseline, I checked what the current situation is. There was a BBC article saying this: \"Ms Sturgeon said she wanted a vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and the spring of the following year. \" (http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-39255181)\nSo, she is determined. However, as later developments showed, Theresa May is determined to hold off on this until after Brexit is completed. Nicola Sturgeon then complained about this, but effectively changed her tune: \"If she\u2019s talking in the spring of 2019, a bit later perhaps than I was suggesting, there may be some room for discussion around that.\" (https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/19/scottish-independence-nicola-sturgeon-willing-to-discuss-delay). So, assuming that Theresa May told her (in no uncertain terms) that she was not going to accept a referendum, and given that any referendum would require the approval of the British government, Nicola Sturgeon's hands would be tied until after Brexit, slated to be completed by end of March, 2019. Assuming Nicola Sturgeon wishes to move for independence straight after this, say April 2019, then 1.5 years back would be somewhere in late 2017. July is still mid-2017, so I think the chances are low.

Sturgeon had called for a referendum to be held between autumn 2018 and spring 2019 but after May said \"now is not the time\", the Scottish leader said she could be prepared to hold a vote later as long as it was not too long after Brexit. \"It is for (May) then to say what timescale she thinks would be appropriate and then yes I am happy to have that discussion within reason,\" Sturgeon said during an interview with ITV. Asked if a vote in 2021 would be reasonable, Sturgeon said it would not because too much time would have lapsed after Britain's EU exit, due in late March 2019, and there could have been too much divergence in areas such as regulations. \"Then gets much harder for Scotland to seek a different course. But if she is talking in the spring of 2019, a bit later perhaps than I was suggesting then there may be some room for discussion around that,\" she said. Sturgeon's comments came as a Panelbase poll for the Sunday Times, carried out since her announcement that she would seek a fresh referendum, put support for independence at 44 percent, while 56 percent backed staying in the United Kingdom. It also found 51 percent of Scots did not want a vote on independence within the next few years.

Speaking in Brussels after First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a planned vote on secession before Brexit in 2019, Michael Russell said any option for Scotland staying in the European Union when the UK left would be a matter for later discussion. But, whatever happens, the nationalist government in Edinburgh would want to be out of the EU for \"the shortest possible time\", Russell, Scotland's Brexit minister, said. \"If the people of Scotland say they wish to continue in membership, then clearly it would be incumbent on those negotiating on both sides to say let us do that as quickly as possible,\" Russell told Reuters (para. 1-4).

Scots voted by a 24-point margin to stay in the EU in last June's referendum, while England and Wales voted to leave. \"That creates a clear set of circumstances for us - but also more widely for others in Europe to understand.

An EU official involved in preparing Brexit talks stressed that Brussels would only talk to May's London government. A Scottish independence vote during the Brexit negotiations would be \"quite a complication\" for negotiators, the official added. It is too early to speculate on how Brussels might handle that, the official said, [ but it would be simpler if all of the United Kingdom left on schedule in early 2019]. **Then, if Scots voted for independence, they could negotiate to join the EU.** Many diplomats believe Scotland could join quite quickly, perhaps within a year or two.

For the Scottish economy, not so much. Recent polls show Scotland is decidedly in favor of European Union membership, and Britain's decision to leave the E.U. only highlights the differences between Scotland and its southern neighbor England. For most of its history, Scotland has been a separate country, with a separate culture. In addition, Scotland hasn't always received a good deal from the U.K.'s parliament. For those reasons leaving the U.K. might make sense. It's a country I lived in for years and for which I have much affection. That is why I'm alarmed by the economic trouble that independence could bring. \u2022\tScotland's membership of the E.U. isn't guaranteed. Indeed, in a move reminiscent of president Obama's Brexit threat, Spain says Scotland will be back of the queue for membership. Spain has its own problems with a potential breakaway region and doesn't want to encourage such efforts. Expect problems f.or Scotland \u2022\tAfter 2020, membership of the E.U. will require joining the euro, the single currency. Since being established the currency hasn't exactly fostered fast economic growth. In fact, it has led to hardship in some of the smaller countries, most notably Greece. At times, the policies for the euro have been a holdover from the old German Bundesbank which for years tried to ensure there would be no repeat of the post WWI hyperinflation. \u2022\tA far better idea would be for Scotland to adopt the British pound at a rate of one Scottish pound to one pound Sterling. But that would mean staying out of the E.U. Using the pound would undoubtedly help Scotland, as close to two-thirds of its trade (63%) comes from the rest of the U.K., according to the Scottish government. \u2022\tE.U. membership, if it happens for Scotland, would mean all sorts of meddlesome edicts from unelected Brussels-based Eurocrats. That would undoubtedly slow economic growth, as it has in mainland Europe. The E.U. might not even exist in a few years, so they'll be nothing for Scotland to join. It's not clear that Britain will be the last country to leave, and the E.U. itself has failed to reform. My bet is that the whole experiment will eventually die. North Sea oil won't be a panacea for the Scottish economy. It's a rare thing for mineral wealth to actually help an economy grow. It's known as the resource trap, as the presence of mineral wealth tends to stymie the growth of export industries. One point to note, commodity prices are cyclical. There are periods of boom followed by periods of bust. It can be rough for a government trying to budget (para. 1-8). Constable, S. (2017).

The gathering of party activists and officials is set to be dominated by Brexit and the prospects for independence.

While it is difficult to ascertain what this will mean in practice, the possibilities of May proposing to Sturgeon that any such referendum be delayed until after Brexit has occured, or even after the next Holyrood (Scottish Parliament) elections (in 2021) have been floated.

Also Sturgeon seems to have admitted that the prospect of an independent Scotland attaining EU membership easily or quickly is not as definite as she had previously implied.  So......there are numerous hurdles to  be overcome before setting a date for a referendum that, if it went the \"wrong\" way, could easily spell not just career suicide for Sturgeon but also (noting the Quebecois precendent) in effect the end of a plausible secessionist cause in Scotland for a prolonged period.... interesting times."], [25875, "2017-03-15T08:30:07Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-03-15T06:21:51Z", [0.0], "Petition to BLOCK Scottish referendum looks set for debate as it nears 100,000 signatures Kirky (2017) Wed, Mar 15, states that: The petition, started by Scottish resident John Innes, has been signed by more than 95,000 people and is likely to meet the 100,000 target by Wednesday morning.

But polls in the last month have shown support for independence rising (para. 1-3). LEGALLY, WHO DECIDES?\nBritain's national parliament is sovereign and is therefore the only legitimate authority to legislate on constitutional issues. Such matters are among the \"reserved\" topics that in general are not devolved to the Scottish Parliament (para. 5).\nWith prior agreement between governments in London and Edinburgh, the UK government can devolve power temporarily from Westminster to the Scottish parliament, Holyrood, making a bill to legislate for an independence referendum in Edinburgh legally watertight. This is known as a Section 30 order (para. 5-6). Both Ruth Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservatives, and Kezia Dugdale, leader of the Scottish Labour Party, have said the UK government should not block \"IndyRef2\" as it is known, if backed by the Scottish people. Both parties formally oppose independence and the holding of a second referendum (para. 9). \nA likely point of contention between Edinburgh and London will now be the timing of a new vote; the Scottish government wants to keep the vote within the two year time frame in which Britain leaves the EU so Scotland has a chance of retaining its EU membership.

Her reasoning: Scots didn\u2019t vote for Brexit and are now being sidelined, exposing a \u201cdemocratic deficit\u201d that only breaking away from the U.K. can ultimately fix (para. 1). 4. When would a vote happen, if at all?\nThat depends on when Sturgeon decides to push for it, and how May responds. Sturgeon might be a tad ambitious with her hope to hold a vote in late 2018. Just in case, she\u2019s ordered her ministers to prepare draft legislation. At the very least, May would want to put off the vote until Brexit is a done deal. That would likely be a few months into 2019, or later (para5). 6. Do the exact terms of Brexit matter?\nMay\u2019s determination to go for a \u201chard Brexit\u201d -- taking Britain out of the EU\u2019s single market -- makes a Scottish independence bid more complicated. Under the independence scenario envisioned by nationalists in the 2014 referendum, Scotland would have kept the pound, gotten a seat on the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee and had no border with the rest of the U.K. (since both would have been EU members). Brexit changes all that. If Scotland were to separate from a post-Brexit U.K., there would be a need for a proper border, and it\u2019s hard to imagine a government that insists on a \"hard Brexit\" offering Scots a say in economic policy (para. 7). 7. So, will Sturgeon go for it?\nScottish independence is the cause that drew her into politics. She must dream of being the person to lead her country out of the union, and if she thinks she has a reasonable chance of winning, she\u2019d surely want to try. If, on the other hand, she called a vote and lost, she probably would settle the question for a generation (para. 7-8). Hutton, R. (2017).

She told the SNP when she launched that manifesto in April 2016 \u201csetting the date for a referendum before a majority of the Scottish people have been persuaded that independence [is] the best future for our country is the wrong way round\u201d. \"No opinion poll since July 2016 has given Sturgeon that majority. Average support for independence sits at about 45% and only about a third of Scottish voters favour staging a referendum before Brexit takes place. \"At the same time, about a third of SNP voters supported leaving the EU, including the former health secretary, Alex Neil. That increases the challenge for Sturgeon to persuade them to support retaining EU membership while also finding enough non-nationalist voters to back independence instead of those SNP voters who abstain or vote no at a referendum. \"Earlier this week Jim Sillars, the Eurosceptic former deputy leader of the SNP, said he would abstain as would many other SNP supporters.

So, will Sturgeon set a date while nothing is clear:  what the deal is or how people will vote on it?

Mrs. May pushed for national unity in a speech on Friday to head off renewed calls for Scottish independence, while accusing the Scottish government of a single-minded obsession with leaving the U.K. The independence push by the Scottish National Party-led government was diverting attention from issues like education and health services, Mrs. May said, just weeks before she formally triggers Brexit negotiations. \u201cPolitics isn't a game and government isn't a platform from which to pursue constitutional obsessions,\u201d the British leader said in a speech to fellow Conservative Party members in the Scottish city of Glasgow. \u201cIt is about taking the serious decisions to improve people\u2019s lives. A tunnel-vision nationalism, which focuses only on independence at any cost, sells Scotland short.\u201d Mrs. May\u2019s plans for Brexit talks have so far gone relatively unchallenged by the opposition Labour Party. A bigger problem for Mrs. May may be brewing discontent in Scotland, which voted overwhelmingly to remain within the EU, and is pushing for more ties to the bloc than Mrs. May has laid out. Scottish leader Nicola Sturgeon, whose party led an unsuccessful referendum to break away in 2014, has signaled there could be a second referendum to protect Scottish interests while Mrs. May pushes forward with her plan to leave the EU\u2019s tariff-free single market for goods and services. Ms. Sturgeon said the prime minister has refused to engage with Scotland on their proposals for EU negotiations. \u201cWhere we have offered compromise, we have been met by a brick wall of Tory intransigence,\u201d Ms. Sturgeon said. \u201cHer government has no mandate in Scotland, and no democratic basis to take us out of Europe and the single market against our will\u201d (para. 1-8).

Mundell, Britain's secretary of state for Scotland, told Reuters the government was 'taking note' of warnings that Scottish leaders are gearing up for a vote which could split the more than three-century-old union between Scotland and England. But the British government does not believe another vote on independence should take place, he said. \"We are aware and take note of what the Scottish government say and do. It would be complacent not to do that,\" he said in an interview at his office overlooking a parade ground just steps from Prime Minister Theresa May's official residence. Mundell, the only elected Conservative lawmaker for Scotland in the British parliament, said the government wanted a good Brexit deal for the whole country, but did not say whether there were particular aspects that would soothe Scottish concerns. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who became leader in 2014 after an unsuccessful referendum to break away and whose Scottish National Party holds 56 of Scotland's 59 seats, has increased the volume on demands that Scotland must have a vote if the country is forced into a \"hard Brexit\".

Writing in the Times newspaper, Sturgeon said Britain's vote to leave the European Union had changed the landscape since Scotland last held a referendum on its independence, voting by a 10-point margin to remain a part of the United Kingdom in 2014. \"If an independence referendum does arise, it will not be down to bad faith on the part of the Scottish government, but to sheer intransigence on the part of the UK government,\" Sturgeon said. \"It is not too late for the UK government to change course, but time is running out.\" While voters in England and Wales strongly supported leaving the EU in last June's referendum, Scots overwhelmingly backed staying inside the bloc.\nSpeculation about a possible second Scottish secession vote has increased in the last week with media reports suggesting nationalists were preparing to call for a referendum as early as next month to coincide with Prime Minister Theresa May's plan to formally trigger Britain's exit from the European Union.

Momentum toward a new vote is growing, with Britain's impending exit from the European Union feeding secession demands. Dugdale, whose party rejects Scottish independence, told a meeting at the party conference in Aberdeen she could \"not imagine\" leading Scottish Labour into a joint campaign with the Conservatives like the 2014 \"Better Together\" campaign which defended the union, a Scottish Labour official said. Despite beating Scottish secession by a 10-point margin in the 2014 referendum, that alliance of historic rivals Labour and Conservatives was consumed with infighting and ended up discrediting many of those involved. The Scottish referendum was then followed by a historic win for Nicola Sturgeon's Scottish National Party (SNP) the following year. It now has 54 of 59 seats representing Scotland in the British parliament in London, taking share mainly from Scottish Labour which has seen its support slump. It would be \"a mistake\" for the head of the Scottish Conservatives, Ruth Davidson, to lead any such new referendum campaign, Dugdale also said. Some politicians have cautioned about the potential hazards of Conservatives, in power in London, giving the impression of telling Scotland what to do. Dugdale will tell delegates at the Scottish Labour conference the party doesn't want another referendum which could break up the three-century-old union of England and Scotland (para. 1-7).

On 16 October 2016, the Scottish Government published a draft bill that would enable a second Scottish independence referendum to occur, after receiving legislative consent. The Scottish Independence Referendum Bill draft is largely similar to its sister act of 2013, and has been put out for consultation by the government to allow the public to convey their views on the wording and procedures of the bill.\n2.  As the constitution is a 'reserved' matter under the Scotland Act 1998, for a future referendum on Scottish independence to be binding under UK law, it would need to receive the consent of the British Parliament to take place.\n3.  The Scotland Act 1998 empowers the Scottish Parliament to legislate in policy areas devolved to Scotland, but one of its clauses obliges the Scottish Parliament to ensure its legislation is compatible with European law. For the UK to completely leave the EU, it would need to remove that obligation. If the UK Parliament wishes to legislate on policy areas devolved to Scotland, or if it wishes to amend the powers devolved to Scotland, by convention it needs the Scottish Parliament to pass a \"legislative consent motion\".\n4.  Media reports suggested this might give the Scottish Parliament a veto over UK withdrawal from the EU, but under the Scotland Act 1998 the UK Parliament could ultimately override the \"veto\" as it is based only on parliamentary convention.\n____________________________________\nCOMMENT:  There are so many issues to iron out before a referendum can take place.

At present there appears to be a small move away from independence sentiment in Scotland (ceteris parabus). The factors I can see now that might swing this more pro are (a) the nature of Brexit - not the simple fact of invoking Article 50, but the vision of what Brexit would be, and (b) the death of Queen Elizabeth II and a decline in identification with the UK as a result.

She raised the possibility of parts of the UK remaining within the EU, or for these areas to have special arrangements with the EU, after the UK leaves. David Edward, a former justice of the European Court of Justice, suggested that these arrangements would relate to policy areas that have been devolved to Scotland.\nSturgeon also met with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, who commented that \"I will listen carefully to what the first minister will tell me... but we don't have the intention, neither Donald Tusk nor myself, to interfere in an inner British process that is not our duty and this is not our job.\" Manfred Weber, leader of the European People's Party Group, and Guy Verhofstadt, leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Group, indicated that they were supportive of Scotland remaining an EU member. Gunther Krichbaum, head of the Bundestag's Committee for EU Affairs, made supportive comments about Scotland becoming a member state of the EU. However, She does NOT have the support of French president Hollande (who cares about him now) and Spanish PM Rajoy (because of his own problems with Catalonia). The new UK Prime Minister Theresa May met with Sturgeon on 15 July in Edinburgh, when May stated that she was \"willing to listen to options\" for Scotland, although she later stated that some options were \"impracticable\". Sturgeon then publicly stated that she had five tests for any future arrangements. The IPPR thinktank stated that Scottish unionists needed to provide options for Scotland, if they wished to retain the British union. The Scottish Labour Party published an 'Action Plan' in July 2016, focusing on the economy. In November 2016, Sturgeon confirmed to members of the Scottish Parliament that the Scottish Government was considering European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and European Economic Area (EEA) models of continued participation in the EU in order to \"protect [Scotland's] place in the single market\" of Europe even if the United Kingdom as a whole does leave in a \"hard Brexit.\"  The Scotland Act 1998 empowers the Scottish Parliament to legislate in policy areas devolved to Scotland, but one of its clauses obliges the Scottish Parliament to ensure its legislation is compatible with European law. For the UK to completely leave the EU, it would need to remove that obligation. If the UK Parliament wishes to legislate on policy areas devolved to Scotland, or if it wishes to amend the powers devolved to Scotland, by convention it needs the Scottish Parliament to pass a \"legislative consent motion\". On 26 June 2016, Sturgeon said she would ask the Scottish Parliament to withhold consent if she thought it was not in Scotland's interests. Giving evidence to a House of Lords committee before the EU referendum, David Edward suggested the consent of the Scottish Parliament would be needed for this legislation. Media reports suggested this might give the Scottish Parliament a veto over UK withdrawal from the EU, but under the Scotland Act 1998 the UK Parliament could ultimately override the \"veto\" as it is based only on parliamentary convention. Alternatively, the UK Parliament could choose to disregard the obligation for the Scottish Parliament to observe EU law.\nOn 16 October 2016, the Scottish Government published a draft bill that would enable a second Scottish independence referendum to occur, after receiving legislative consent [In Scotland, a list of matters is explicitly reserved in the Scotland Act. Any matter not explicitly listed in the Act is implicitly devolved to the Scottish Parliament. Reserved powers can be transferred from Westminster to Scotland under Section 30 of the Scotland Act 1998, for example in the Edinburgh Agreement, 2012.]. \nThe Scottish Independence Referendum Bill draft is largely similar to its sister act of 2013, and has been put out for consultation by the government to allow the public to convey their views on the wording and procedures of the bill. Meanwhile:Support for Scottish independence has fallen below the 45 per cent achieved in the 2014 referendum, a new poll has found. The YouGov poll for The Times newspaper found backing for a Yes vote in a second ballot on the country\u2019s constitutional future stands at 44 per cent, with No on 56 per cent. It comes as the Scottish National Party concludes its national survey, which aimed to speak to two million voters about their views on Europe, Brexit and independence. Valuable data gathered during the exercise could be used by the party if First Minister Nicola Sturgeon decides to call another referendum on leaving the UK.\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/scottish-independence-support-for-second-referendum-plummets-a7447196.html\n________________________________\nCOMMENT:  Nicola Sturgeon is giving a lot of grief to an already embattled Ms. May.

The key factors in this equation from my POV are 1) the UK Government's response to the Supreme Court's decision on the legality of activating Article 50 without Parliamentary approval; 2) the prospect, timing and outcome of any UK General Election between now and July 2017; 3) the results of the presidential election in France; 4) Angela Merkel's decision to try for another term as German chancellor; and 5) the timeframe posed in the question. Working backwards in order of priority, the biggest factor contributing to my estimate is the logistics of organising another referendum in ~7 months. I cannot see the SNP pushing for one so soon given all the other balls in the air. Far better to wait and see what happens in relation to the other points I will discuss shortly than dive into another referendum next summer, particularly given the likely impact these other points will have on the (existence of) EU. Flowing from the logistics point, the elections coming up in France and Germany will be pivotal in the SNP's decision on whether to hold another referendum. If Le Pen wins in France in April, as I suspect, the attraction of leaving the UK to rejoin the EU will be greatly diminished because the EU will not survive in its current form. I cannot see the SNP calling another referendum before the French presidential election takes place. Building on the French elections, I think Angela Merkel's decision on whether to run for another term as Chancellor will provide a solid indication of the prevailing winds in Europe and this will further influence the SNP's decision on whether to hold another referendum. On balance, I think Merkel will run again because she recognises that her experience and the values she espouses will be vital to maintaining the European liberalism she has come to embody over the coming years. lf, however, Merkel gives up and retires in horror at the nationalist forces running rampant across Europe, this would further reduce the likelihood of another referendum taking place before July 2017. Closer to home, I expect the Conservative UK Government to try to ram the activation of Article 50 through Parliament via an accelerated approvals process that severely restricts parliamentary oversight of the process of activation. The Government will succeed in this and I feel it will further contribute to the delay of another referendum as a result of the lack of clarity over the terms of the UK's renegotiated relationship with the EU, which will only become subject to Parliamentary oversight/influence later on.

AFP (2016) states that: Glasgow (AFP) - Separatist leader Nicola Sturgeon on Saturday said her belief that Scotland will become independent was stronger than ever as she confirmed preparations for a second referendum for leaving Britain. The Scottish National Party (SNP) leader, first minister of the semi-autonomous Scottish government, has pledged to \u201cexplore all options\u201d to prevent Scotland being taken out of the European Union against its will. But with some of these options already being dismissed by the British government, Sturgeon has said another independence referendum is \"highly likely\".\nIn a speech on the final day of the SNP conference in Glasgow, Sturgeon said: \"I have never doubted that Scotland will one day become an independent country.\n\"And I believe it today more strongly than I ever have before. \"But I've always known that it will happen only when a majority of our fellow citizens believe that becoming independent is the best way to build a better future, together.\" The SNP will present a bill for another referendum to the Scottish Parliament next week. It would be pursued if all other options to keep Scotland in the EU should fail. British unionists warned Scots that remaining in the UK was the only way to protect Scotland\u2019s place in the EU, and Scotland voted against independence in 2014.\nBut Scotland now faces the prospect of being taken out of the EU along with the rest of the UK, despite voting by 62 percent to remain.\nSturgeon said: \"We will propose new powers to help keep Scotland in the single market even if the UK leaves. \"But if the Tory government rejects these efforts, if it insists on taking Scotland down a path that hurts our economy, costs jobs, lowers our living standards and damages our reputation as an open, welcoming, diverse country, then be in no doubt. \"Scotland must have the ability to choose a better future, and I will make sure that Scotland gets that chance.\"\nSturgeon acknowledged, however, that independence would \"bring its own challenges\" (para. 1-13).

Nicola Sturgeon has already expressed her intentions to hold a second referendum on whether Scotland should leave the UK [and join the EU]. However, this issue will not be as simple as that. For one, the UK appears to be reluctant to invoke Article 50 due to the economic and regulatory uncertainty that it could potentially generate in the near term. In addition, negotiating new trade deals with the EU will be a laborious process and could put off investment in the short-run and reduce the potential growth trajectory of the UK in the long run, due to increased tariffs and non-tariff barriers. The UK could ultimately call for a second referendum on whether to stay in the EU again.  As a result of all these uncertainties surrounding the UK in the short run, I believe that Scotland will adopt a sit-and-wait approach to leave the UK. They will bear in mind the financial repercussions of Brexit [albeit short], and its implications on business and consumer confidence.

An Independence referendum is a UK Constitutional matter. Constitutional matters have not been devolved to the Scottish Parliament (\"Scotland\") but are reserved by the UK Parliament in Westminster. Therefore before Scotland could set a date for a referendum the Westminster Parliament would have to pass legislation authorising  it. There seems to be no appetite by the UK government to authorise another referendum. \nTherefore in order for anyone to set a date for another referendum would require (a) The Scottish Parliament to decide that there was a very high probability of winning a 2nd independence referendum (b) the Scottish government demanding that events had meant that the results of the first referendum should be ignored and request that Westminster authorise a 2nd referendum  (c) something to happen to change the UK government's mind. \nAlthough the UK has voted for Brexit, which could be considered grounds for holding a 2nd referendum, as yet it is totally unclear what form Brexit will be (or indeed if it will actually happen). Until it is clear what form  Brexit will take it will remain equally unclear what impact, if any, it would have on Scotland there are not really any grounds for holding a 2nd Scottish referendum.\nCoupled with this the problems that are arising from having a Brexit referendum that only established what the voters did not want (they did not want to be in the EU) but did not actually establish what relationship, if any, voters wanted the UK to have with the EU. It can now be seen that there is a very high probability that having voted for Brexit, whatever relationship between the UK and EU results, a majority of voters will be unhappy with the outcome (e.g. if 48% did not want to leave, 10% want no deal with the EU at all, 10% want to be in the EEA, and 32% want some other arrangement then it will not be possible to give the majority what they want). The 1st Scottish referendum was a vague as the UK EU referendum, now with the benefit of the Brexit vote it is likely that Scottish Independence voters would want to vote for something more concrete than just leaving the UK, they would expect to be voting for a specific relationship with both the UK and EU.    \nIt is probable that by July 2017 it will still be unclear what the relationship between the UK and EU will be. \n "], [27879, "2016-07-28T15:28:12Z", [0.22], "Theresa May would delay invoking article 50 for as long as possible within the legal time frame.\nAlthough the Scottish would most probably call for another referendum, they would not do that until its official. \nThe SNP needs to meet numerous requirements to fulfill before that day, which would definitely slow down the process.

Wikipedia says [1] the referendum started life as a bill before parliament, introduced on 21 March 2013, and passed on 14 November 2013 (so about 8 months later). Since the bill includes the date for the referendum, I assume we would say \"Scotland set a date for another referendum\" when another such bill *passes*, not when it is proposed. So the question is, what are the odds such a bill would be proposed and passed by 1 July 2017? Let's break this down into two questions: (1) About how long will it take for a new referendum bill to be INTRODUCED? (2) After it's introduced, how long before it's PASSED? Let's tackle (2) first. On the one hand, since the new referendum bill would be so similar to the previous one, we might predict that it will take about as long to pass, i.e. 8 months. On the other hand, exactly because it is so similar, we might predict that it will pass much more quickly, since the negotiations about the details (campaign rules, who is and is not allowed to vote, etc [2]) have already been conducted and people might agree to reuse the existing details. Let's say it takes 2 months under that scenario. On the third hand, the referendum legislation seems like pretty standard election legislation [2] so ironing out of details might not be the main determinant of how long it takes the bill to pass --- bringing us back to the 8-month estimate. I'm really unsure which scenario is more likely so I'll just average the three options to get an expected delay of (8+2+8)/3 = 6 months between the bill being proposed and passed. What about (1)? It's hard to say how long it took the SNP to introduce the bill; who knows how long they worked on it before bringing it to the floor? But a rough estimate may be obtained as follows. Scottish independence is a major issue for the SNP. The SNP first won a majority in parliament in the May 2011 elections [3] (quite dramatically) and they proposed the bill on 21 March 2013. That's a delay of 22 months. So it's unlikely that it took them less than a year to draft the bill. On the other hand, the same concerns as above might apply: one referendum bill already exists, why not copy most of it? It is literally the same referendum. Apparently the Scottish government has already \"agreed to draft legislation to allow the second referendum\" [4,5]. Of course, the other big factor in lawmaking is politicking. The SNP lost its majority in the May 2016 elections [6] so now they have to negotiate harder with the other parties for the funds to hold the referendum, to allow it to be held at all, etc. Finally, there is Brexit itself, the driver of this new referendum. Presumably it would make little sense to hold it before Brexit actually goes through; I imagine the Scottish people would oppose a premature referendum, so politicians won't propose one. So to the delays above one must add the delays in the invocation of Article 50. Remember, the UK referendum is not legally binding, it is merely \"advisory\". Article 50 is another stalemate, this time between UK & EU; the UK wants the EU to offer trade deals before it takes the irreversible step of formally leaving; the EU obviously wants the UK to formally leave, thereby losing leverage, before offering trade deals [7]. I don't know. It seems to me very unlikely that Article 50 would be invoked in the next couple of months; or that a new referendum bill would be introduced less than 6 months after that; or that the bill would pass in less than 4 months after THAT. So the odds of ALL these things happening should be extremely low. If I assign 20% odds to each of the preceding 3 I come up with less than 1% odds for ALL of them happening. Feels too extreme, and this is a situation with many moving parts that may change quickly. Calling it 5%.
