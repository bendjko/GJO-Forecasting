But opposition critics were quick to dismiss his designation as improvisation Maduro, who just last month shuffled his Cabinet. Bottomline for me is that the new economic czar is an improvement over the previous man, and serious efforts are being made to re-negotiate loan terms, but all this will only delay the crisis if Maduro doesn't agree to radical restructuring of the nation's economy, starting perhaps with increasing the price of gasoline from something around 1 cent per gallon."], [1993, "2016-02-17T04:52:56Z", [0.03], "Not before the end of the month."], [15997, "2016-02-17T03:46:04Z", [0.01], ""], [11057, "2016-02-17T03:14:12Z", [0.03], ""], [2, "2016-02-17T03:07:18Z", [0.03], ""], [767, "2016-02-17T02:51:06Z", [0.05], "Pres.

Hence the growing likelihood of a default, with Medley Global Advisors, a macro research service owned by the FT, pointing to a first crunch point in May, when $700m of interest falls due, though the government may last until the fourth quarter of the year, when it must repay more than $4bn. \"At this point, only political change can forestall such a scenario. The government is clearly not capable of implementing the wholesale overhaul of the economy that is required, even if the various, and increasingly embittered, factions within the chavista movement could agree on how to proceed. The opposition is also unproven but . . .  understands what needs to be done and would have international goodwill and the ability to recruit foreign expertise.  \"So is a peaceful political transition possible? Venezuela is on its way to democracy and it is unlikely that Maduro can do more than delay what looks like an inevitable fall from power. But, as Medley warns, such transitions can be messy as the layers of authoritarianism that have been built up over years are dismantled. The government controls most of the institutions, including the Supreme Court. The latter can, for example, spin things out by overturning decisions made by the opposition in the national assembly, though its judges would be unlikely to stand firm against overwhelming public protests. The army is another matter and if it intervened to support the government it could trigger bloodshed.

Zero Hedge also reports that \"Venezuela is now literally flying in paper money (using three dozen cargo Boeing 747s).\"  Not a problem, says Venezuelan \"economic tsar ... Luis Salas, a sociologist who comes from the far-left fringes of chavismo. He regards inflation as a capitalist conspiracy against consumers and denies that the Central Bank helps cause it by printing money to finance the budget deficit.\" (He apparently missed the Milton Friedman lecture in his economics class. Oh, wait \u2014 he didn't do economics.)

Venezuela faces a payment on its debt on February 26, and vows it will make the payment. (Wall Street Journal, no link.) It has, however, only $1.5 billion in foreign exchange, and it is taking the desperate step of pledging its gold reserves against its debt. It was doing the same with the Bank for International Settlements, but the BIS stopped making those deals last year, because of the associated risk. If things go south, Venezuela will have to actually pony up the physical gold, which has in itself gotten complicated because Chavez moved all Venezuela's gold from foreign banks where it had been held to Venezuela's central bank, and now counterparties on the gold deals want the gold certified \u2014 i.e., is this really gold you're shipping me, or gilded lead bars? (Read the Zero Hedge post.) And for a final twist, the value of gold has been dropping, as we know.

Adding some context to those coming to this now. Here is the conventional wisdom:\n1) Venezuela has \u201calways\u201d made its sovereign bond payments.\n2) They have enough money to pay in February and will therefore do so.\n3) They will likely default later in 2016 in October or November. The base scenario is that they will pay the $2.1 billion they owe in February (I\u2019ve got it 64% likely that they will pay,  below market rate but still above a coin flip) and default in October or November (chances are better than 80% of a default this year). Why would Venezuela default now instead of later this year (in order to likelihood)?\n1) They just don\u2019t have the money. It\u2019s possible that they want to pay but that their bank accounts have run dry. While they have $15 billion reserves on paper, a significant portion of the foreign reserves are in gold, which aren\u2019t liquid and can\u2019t be used for payments. They probably only have $1.5-3 billion in cash and must burn through $1.1 billion in cash per month to pay for food. For those who like math, $1.1 billion for food plus $2.1 billion for debt equals $3.2 billion in payments in February for a government that has at most $3 billion in cash reserves. Yet, nearly everyone (myself included) is working on the assumption they will magically make $200 million appear between now and the end of February to make the payment. Our conventional wisdom rests of the belief that they will pull some financial rabbit out of the hat (again). The fact the numbers don\u2019t add up and we\u2019re all waiting to see this financial magic should push at least a few of you down around the 0% number to hedge at least slightly. Remember, the Maduro economic team is a bunch of amateurs right now. Given the cash squeeze, they could screw this up by simply not having the funds they think they have the moment the bond payment is due. 2) They recognize that they will likely default later this year and choose to default early and use the money for food and other imports. This could be a strategic decision on their part. 3) If there is an ICSID ruling against the country (Venezuela faces about two dozen outstanding cases there worth several billion dollars) and Venezuela chooses not to pay or can\u2019t pay, the country enters instant default. No rulings are expected until Quarter 2 of this year, so this is an unlikely scenario for the next month but is still a possibility. 4) If some bond holders find a legal mechanism to accelerate their payments. Should it happen? No. But some of these bond holders are sharks that smell blood and are willing to use any technicality they can. Final note: The $1.5 billion sovereign bond payment due in late February has a 30 day grace period (and GJ may or may not take that into account). The PDVSA bond interest due in late February ($600 million) does not have a grace period and would be instant default. A default on one does not accelerate the other. The chance that they strategically default on one and not the other and the grace period causes this to be scored a no is why I\u2019m at 24% instead of 36%."], [10039, "2016-01-31T07:15:35Z", [0.15], ""], [2, "2016-01-31T03:49:11Z", [0.09], ""], [2965, "2016-01-31T03:24:51Z", [0.0], "In fact a technical default may not be material.Depends on bond covenants.

Government debt is 50% of Venezuela's GDP and external debt mounts to US$ 185 billion. Venezuela is import dependent of many goods including food and it imports a total of US$ 12.25 billion a year. On top of that, Venezuela in the last 16 months had paid more than US$ 27 billion and in order to meet its obligation this year it will need to raise more than US$ 10 billion. US$ 2.28 next month. However, although default looks almost like a certainty, it\u00b4s important to raise some considerations here. Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's Government does not want to default on its debt, because eviction is something that could follow right after that. So, self-preservation has a heavy weight here. Thus, what I believe that is going to happen is that Venezuela will continue to swap part of its gold reserves (US$ 16.4 billion) to meet its debt obligation at the same time that will force import contraction.

Anyways, it seems to be too late and too little, but it would certainly buy him some time. Moreover, Maduro is pushing for an OPEC meeting in February to try to raise oil prices. Finally, China, Russia and now Iran (thanks to the end of the economic embargo) could bail out Venezuela with another loan. Thus, in a nutshell I believe that there is a 83% of probability of a Venezuelan default this year. However, a default before 1 March 2016 has, in my opinion a lower chance of 14%.

One of the articles below suggests they aren't even paying USD 100 million to some foreign dairy farmers. Of course they could just be prioritizing paying bond holders and that is why have not paid (or maybe they dispute the charge?). The third story is more worrying for time frames beyond that which concerns us, but I can't help but think all of the chaos may just overwhelm them in time to be relevant. If they default now or in the fall makes little difference to the country. Best spin is the relevant decision makers are hoping for a rebound in oil.

The question team discussed but decided not to issue official guidance on this specific question, however it raised an important issue for how we set the deadlines for future questions on default and other measures so thank you for raising it.  Please use your best judgement, keeping in mind that, in general, it is GJI's policy not to close questions based on events that occur after the deadline has passed. You can see our general guidance on that issue and others on our Question FAQ (https://www.gjopen.com/faq/questions). Thank you again for raising this issue.\" That's a shame. Good to know that they may take grace periods into account for future debt default questions. I would recommend that they set the standard as \"This question will be judged a yes if by 31 March at least two major ratings agencies or banks judge Venezuela to be in default or technical default on any debt payments due before 1 March 2016.\" But in this case, oh well. The large $1.5 billion coupon payment in the final week in February has a 30 day grace period. Banks usually provide the country or debtor the 30 days to pay, then announce the country is retroactively in default as of the payment date. The PDVSA interest payment in February (a couple hundred million) has zero grace period. If they default, it is immediate. The consensus analysis from bond market junkies is that the sovereign debt and Pdvsa debt are separate, meaning a default on one will not allow bond holders to accelerate the other. The question of which assets can or will be seized in case of sovereign or Pdvsa default remains up in the air. I write that out because Venezuela may choose to strategically default on one debt and hope to protect the other, while bond holders may try to treat it all as one issue. There are some interesting reasons for Venezuela to choose to default on one and not the other, and which one they default on will determine if they get a grace period. Then again, they could pay all their bills in February as expected (I have a 64% chance of that occurring) and this will all be a moot point.

However, the vast majority of that is gold. And most of the gold is stored in Caracas (stupid, stupid, stupid), not London or New York, meaning it can't be easily leveraged for a quick loan or sold for cash. According to this analysis, which appears accurate compared to the country's official 2015 statements, Venezuela only has $1.3 billion in liquid cash. Other analysis suggests that number may be closer to $3 billion.  They must pay a $1.5 billion sovereign coupon in the final week of February, plus another $600 million in interest on other payments, for this question to resolve as a no. Plus, the government has to pay for food and anything else the people in the country want (at a cost of about $1.1 billion per month), and nearly every country on earth is demanding cash on delivery or before delivery, which eats into the reserves.  No problem, right? If they're running low on funds, just have PDVSA transfer over some more funds. Or pull from the mysterious Fondev black box account that nobody knows how much is in. Or borrow more from China. Or the IMF special drawing rights.  Except with the Venezuelan oil barrel only pulling in $20 per barrel, that is their break-even cost. PDVSA is currently losing or barely making any money on each barrel and nobody knows how much they have left. AND Pdvsa needs to pay cash on market for naptha to dilute the country's heavy oil if they want anything to work. Eventually Fondev runs out of money. China may not be in the mood to lend billions (Venezuela actually owes China a few billion in payments this year). Venezuela pulled $2 billion from IMF SDR funds last year and I think they're about tapped there. I'm reaffirming my previous prediction of 36% chance of default here. I think it's more likely than not that they'll find a magic way to make the cash appear for a payment in late February. But it's going to be close.

Many are unaware that in the absence of CACs [collective action clauses] in PDVSA and some sovereign bonds, the legal difficulties posed by a friendly restructuring are similar to those entailed by a hostile default. The discussion is made even more confusing by the fact that many in the opposition would like to see the [President Nicolas] Maduro administration default not because they think this is a good policy choice, but because it would serve as demonstration of its incapacity to manage the economy. This fact is also one of the reasons why the government is willing to pay a very high cost to continue to service its external debt.\u201d\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  I think I've allowed my low opinion of Maduro and his economic policies to cloud my judgment.  I wasn't aware that anyone was saying that Venezuela had the resources to meet its obligations.   I'm flipping my forecast.
