I'll take him at his word that he's vetting experienced politicians with Congressional connections.  Apparently he values loyalty and employees that offer opposing viewpoints (http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/20/politics/donald-trump-vice-president/). A good personality fit will mater more than geography.   Overall, he will have a much smaller pool to choose from than previous nominees.

I think the list of people interested will be predominated by those looking to majorly raise their profile (a la Fallin) or those looking to get back in the game (think Gingrich).  So, there's a limited amount of time to choose, limited options, and at this point the former candidates are the politicians he knows best.

In only 2 of those elections - 1980 and 1948 - was a former candidate selected for VP. There are arguments to be made here as to what period should be considered given how the nomination process has changed, but (admittedly based on a small sample) the base rate is low, in the 10-20% range depending on when you want to cut off the data.  It is however worth noting that democrats have generally been more willing to pick VPs who were former candidates, this occurring in 08,04,76,60 and 56. I'm not sure how to balance out the addition of valuable data points with the fact we are talking about different parties, so I will put my base rate at the top of the 10-20% range. Switching to the inside view: I certainly do not think Trump is more likely than the average republican to pick a former candidate, if anything the opposite. The only one who I think is under serious consideration and likely to accept would be Christie. Maybe Carson pulls some Cheney-esque jujitsu to go from \"helping pick VP\" to \"being VP\".
