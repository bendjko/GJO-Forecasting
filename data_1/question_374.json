A Trump action could cite specific reasons for restrictions such as terrorism state sponsor (and of interest here is that Iran, Sudan and Syria - the three designated state sponsors of terrorism - are amongst the countries concerned) or it could use more fuzzy language like \"to the extent permitted by law\" which might rely on terrorist designations as a basis for the action rather than explicitly citing this as the reason in the order. That said, the question notes only overlap between a designated country and one from which immigration is suspended, rather than citing it as a specific reason for the new restriction.  Two other points. \"Suspend\" suggests total ban rather than simply some manner of \"extreme vetting\" or additional restriction. This is probably where the question hinges - the requirement for a total suspension. Secondly, the question is \"immigration\" rather than refugees or asylum thus a specific legal category.

I think for a suspension of immigration for so short a time, it might make more sense to use the provision Trump cited to during the campaign (which is given in the question summary) rather than the provision you've thought the administration would use, which would perhaps make more sense for a suspension of immigration that had real teeth...

This means that we can almost certainly scrub out many of the above list (especially those that aren't related to Islamic terrorism, i.e. Colombia). The political blowback would be very heavy and would certainly alienate the country in question, along with its allies. It would illicit immediate retaliation on US nationals abroad as well. It would be a very painful move to make, especially just to appease Trump's base (many of whom seem to support him no matter what he does) immediately after the inauguration, when he's not feeling any pressure to act.  Another thing to think about: how large is the diaspora of the above countries in the USA (think: how big could the pushback be?)? There are hundreds of thousands of Syrian Americans and Iraqi Americans already in the USA, as well as large numbers of Pakistani, Afghani, and Somali Americans who are quite well-integrated. There is an incredible amount of religious diversity in many of these countries, and given that Trump's rhetoric has been about religion, not nationality, I don't see how it could be politically expedient to ban all Syrians (for example), when he really only cares about Muslims. Especially not within a short 3-month time period.  This all could change if there's a big attack in the USA or elsewhere before the question's end date, but at the moment I'd say it seems very unlikely. Probably more likely that he would ban Syrians (for example) entering as refugees and continue allowing those entering through the regular immigration process as usual, but that's not what the question is asking.

I believe that there is a greater chance of perceiving that the latter goal (banning all Muslims) could be largely accomplished in a practical way by making it less obvious to the eye.

Taking a symbolic tough line on immigration/terrorism line without the blanket discrimination of a ban on muslim immigration. My guess - and I haven't researched it - is that immigration (rather than asylum/defections) from state sponsor's of terrorism is already effectively banned, so the question seems to require either new designation of a country as a state sponsor, or a blanket ban on immigration from a country following a huge terrorist atrocity there (or connected with it) early in 2017.
