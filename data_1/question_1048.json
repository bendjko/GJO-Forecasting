The king has also named MbS as the head of a commission charged with reorganizing their intelligence services after the reports of this assassination came to light. \nSource:\n-https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/03/11/mohammed-bin-salman-is-here-to-stay/\n-https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/12/saudi-arabia-crown-prince-mohammed-wings-clipped-as-khashoggi-death-rattles-riyadh\n-https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/10/22/saudi-king-salman-mbs-jamal-khashoggi-221670"], [27485, "2019-05-08T00:53:51Z", [0.75, 0.2, 0.05], ""], [45198, "2019-05-07T23:25:03Z", [0.15, 0.0, 0.85], ""], [35580, "2019-05-07T21:47:52Z", [0.5, 0.0, 0.5], "I don't foresee him leaving his without becoming king as he's cemented control over the power brokers within the kingdom and we know that the king has health problems"], [73053, "2019-05-07T21:37:24Z", [0.35, 0.05, 0.6], ""], [12856, "2019-05-07T20:26:37Z", [0.1, 0.05, 0.85], ""], [40848, "2019-05-07T18:24:45Z", [0.05, 0.01, 0.94], ""], [2825, "2019-05-07T15:11:43Z", [0.05, 0.01, 0.94], ""], [37488, "2019-05-07T03:55:12Z", [0.01, 0.02, 0.97], ""], [66674, "2019-05-07T03:40:03Z", [0.11, 0.02, 0.87], ""], [691, "2019-05-06T12:26:48Z", [0.11, 0.02, 0.87], ""], [1333, "2019-05-06T11:31:45Z", [0.2, 0.0, 0.8], ""], [24146, "2019-05-06T01:09:59Z", [0.05, 0.15, 0.8], ""], [1034, "2019-05-05T18:48:05Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [66950, "2019-05-05T17:19:50Z", [0.15, 0.0, 0.85], "It is highly unlikely that Mohammed bin Salman will cease to be the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia.

However, last week the CEO's of some of the world's largest banks and financial institutions went to Riyadh for a two day conference and seem to have done  a lot of business.  Saudi Arabia has also made deals with Pakistan and China worth billions since the murder.    Moreover, MBS has been meeting with various world leaders, including Putin, who have welcomed him, if not always as warmly as before.    Hence, there is not much chance he will cease to be the crown prince.  Nevertheless, there is a chance.  His father is 83 years old.  If he dies, it is likely, MBS will become king.  The term \"crowned prince\" means MBS is the designated successor.  The USA Social Security survival tables suggest he would have about an eight percent chance of dying in a year.  I suspect he may have lower probability of death since he likely receives very good health care.   Moreover, there are only four months between now and October 1.  Thus, there is a 2 percent chance of dying-- perhaps even less.   I doubt the distribution for deaths during a year are uniform.   That is, older people did more often so there are probably at least slightly more deaths toward the end of the 83 year than the beginning.    There is also a chance his father could retire and MBS could succeed him.  I think maybe a 10 percent chance given his age and MBS' problems with the murder.

U.S. officials interviewed for this story believe, based on several years of intelligence, that MBS took action against his mother because he was concerned that she opposed his plans for a power grab that could divide the royal family and might use her influence with the king to prevent it.

Furthermore, with the police power and money largely behind MBS, there isn't much the Saud family can do that would maintain stability and maintain the general power of the family over one particular faction in any cohesive way except (I think) to wait until King Salman limits MBS' power or King Salman dies and the succession to MBS has to be ratified by the Allegiance Council:\n\"...some members of Saudi Arabia\u2019s ruling family are agitating to prevent Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman from becoming king, three sources close to the royal court said. ...Dozens of princes and cousins from powerful branches of the Al Saud family want to see a change in the line of succession but would not act while King Salman - the crown prince\u2019s 82-year-old father - is still alive, the sources said. They recognize that the king is unlikely to turn against his favorite son, known in the West as MbS. ...Rather, they are discussing the possibility with other family members that after the king\u2019s death, Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, 76, a younger full brother of King Salman and uncle of the crown prince, could take the throne, according to the sources.  Prince Ahmed, King Salman\u2019s only surviving full brother, would have the support of family members, the security apparatus and some Western powers, one of the Saudi sources said.  ...He was one of only three people on the Allegiance Council, made up of the ruling family\u2019s senior members, who opposed MbS becoming crown prince in 2017, two Saudi sources said at the time.   ...When the king dies or is no longer be able to rule, the 34-member Allegiance Council, a body representing each line of the ruling family to lend legitimacy to succession decisions, would not automatically declare MbS the new king.  Even as crown prince, MbS would still need the council to ratify his ascension, one of the three Saudi sources said. While the council accepted King Salman\u2019s wish to make MbS crown prince, it would not necessarily accept MbS becoming king when his father dies, especially given that he sought to marginalize council members.\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-khashoggi-royals-exclusive/exclusive-after-khashoggi-murder-some-saudi-royals-turn-against-kings-favorite-son-idUSKCN1NO2KP\nhttps://www.trtworld.com/middle-east/could-prince-ahmed-bin-abdulaziz-replace-crown-prince-mohammed-bin-salman-21832 I agree with the Foreign Policy author that King Salman is unlikely to remove MBS from his position, or if he does, to do it in line with the direction of succession he has been moving in.  I don't think he will publicly chastise MBS nor publicly retreat on his own policy measures, but I don't think he has a lot of options to address the power issue either directly or indirectly.  He does seem to be unhappy with the state of affairs currently.  \n\"...It is unclear from recent official press statements about the king and the prince\u2019s activities whether Prince Mohammed has been absent from all of the high-profile events, but the prince has not appeared in any recent photographs or press statements, apart from a report that he spoke to Japan\u2019s prime minister Shinzo Abe over the phone last week.  ...Though Prince Mohammed has missed meetings before, a source familiar with the workings of the royal court said there was genuine surprise at some of the \u2018no-shows\u2019 in the last fortnight.  The king is understood to have been particularly displeased with his son\u2019s absence from the cabinet meeting on Tuesday, during which the king discussed the many challenges facing the kingdom.  In a two-hour address, the king is understood to have raised concerns over alleged lost investments into Saudi Arabia.  It led to a demand that all major future financial decisions would, for the time being, need the king\u2019s personal approval, according to the account given to the Guardian. The decision was considered effective immediately and concerned major investments by the kingdom and other contracts.  ...Tensions are said to have flared up after Prince Mohammed announced two important personnel decisions hours after the king left Saudi Arabia for an official visit to Egypt.  The promotion of Princess Reema bint Bandar bin Sultan to serve as Saudi ambassador to the US, and the promotion of Prince Mohammed\u2019s brother, Khalid bin Salman, to the ministry of defence, were allegedly announced without the king\u2019s approval or knowledge.  The decrees to make the changes were signed by the crown prince in his role as \u201cdeputy king\u201d, which some experts said was exceedingly rare.\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/18/saudi-crown-prince-allegedly-stripped-of-some-authority I don't know what a satisfactory solution would be, but King Salman doesn't seem so mentally weak and confused yet that he would give over his power to his \"deputy king\" when he's still King and disagrees with what or the way things are done.  But I think his generation feels more strongly in the democratic nature of their oligarchy than in the singularity or stability of one faction or vision, even if stability and focus was King Salman's goal in the decrees that brought MBS front and center.   I also agree with the Foreign Policy author in his argument that the Saud family has rallied to the throne in times of crisis.  But I think there is an effort to find ways to support the throne without supporting MBS to its succession.  And I think the argument / rumor that King Salman's brother be a likely or even the most likely replacement is strong (it's a return to tradition prior to King Salman's decrees in 2017) but probably an undesirable or risky move because it would also undermine the King's authority in making those decrees.  But the succession has seen enough recent changes it's hard to tell how sacrosanct it is.  Maybe more important is to not reverse an authoritative move.  I don't have a deep knowledge of political maneuvering in Saudi Arabia, but some of the slowness to change seems to me to be a result of the \"regulatory\" nature of royal authority as opposed to a written body of law.  People can interpret changes in a more modern way but are bound in some ways (as has been very clear in KSA) by the expectations and understanding of tradition vs. need.  The family is slow to change because the people and culture are slow to change mindsets.  I think MBS has been so successful because he is good at using traditional power mechanisms while tying them to themes of modernization and progress.  King Salman won't go back on MBS unless he can do so by moving forward in the succession / family power structure, and the royal family won't go against the King or rebel against the power of the state (MBS) without Salman taking the lead.  If there's a way out where the pressure won't hold, they seem likely to be able to find it, and there seems to be enough consensus across the family to make it a possibility at least. https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/03/11/mohammed-bin-salman-is-here-to-stay/ So I think it's a waiting game, and I think October is too soon for the pace of politics from either King Salman or the Saud family / Alliegiance Council.  They need to maintain the power of the traditions without upsetting them even more.  Limiting MBS' power at this point is more crucial than ousting him, I would think.  But no significant enough moves to limit MBS' power publicly have been made (as were made 6 months or more before the previous succession changes) to make it likely that there is a shift being planned or already in process.  And if 6-8 months is how long those moves have taken most recently, it seems that October is pushing the timeline for a major succession change.  Things may seem desperate, but I think the Saud family doesn't let anything seem that desperate (even if it may be) because it would undermine their authority.  I think Salman naming a deputy crown prince would be the most likely sign that there is a move/plan to change, or at least curtail the overweening power of, MBS.

Prior to this occasion, the Crown Prince had shown that he was open to moderate reform, and rather than resign, he may look to placate Human Rights accusations by lifting additional restrictions in the country: further contributing to his remaining in his current position.

Rigging the elections ie  gerrymangering is one of the tactics.

Given that Saudi Arabia doesn't have a history of Kings stepping down before their death, thereby precluding this scenario, let's talk death.  King Salman is 82 years old. As someone else noted previously: using historical data on Saudi Arabia life expectancy, the likelihood of dying between the ages of 80 and 84, as well as between the ages 75 to 79, is 45.7% and 30.5%, respectively (when linearly extrapolated to 2019). [1] Given that this probability covers a period of 4 years (ages 80 to 84) and the forecast question covers a period of approximately 1 year (now until October 2019), this places the average likelihood of death over the next year at approximately 3.8% (45.7 - 30.5 / 4). It's probably slightly higher given that it's in the latter half of the 80 to 84 range and the likelihood of death is not normally distributed, but rather skewed higher as age increases. Here's where things get complicated. As someone pointed out, King Salman had a stroke in 2010 (8 years ago). A medical study suggests that the cumulative risk of death in the 10 years following a stroke is enhanced by a factor of 1.9 due to a greater risk of cardiovascular-related deaths [2; Table 2, Column 3, Row 7]. This seems compatible with his genes; his two oldest sons, Fahd and Ahmad, have already died as a result of heart problems. [3] Also, King Salman's alleged diagnosis of mild dementia increases the likelihood of death. One medical study suggests that it increases death by a factor of approximately 1.7. [4; Table 1, Columns 2 & 3, Row 3]. At any rate, the combination of both does not bode well for King Salman's health. However, he's likely receiving the best care, relative to the average Saudi citizen, which attenuates the likelihood of death.  So in summary, the average likelihood of death would be 3.8% given his age. Incorporating his medical history and top-of-the-line healthcare, this increases by a factor of approximately 2.5.  Therefore, I'm going to place the probability of King Salman's death, and the subsequent transition of power to MBS, at 10% -- although, I didn't plan on it becoming an even 10. NOT BECOMING KING: This is much more challenging to ascertain.  Of the 12 named crown princes, only 1 has been substituted, placing the probability at approximately 8%. [5] However, it was MBS who plotted to remove MBN, thereby granting him the status of crown prince. [6] Moreover, given the consolidation of his power and immense influence in Saudi politics, I do not believe he will be relieved from power. Finally, I do not believe recent events will compel any change; resource-rich monarchies, out of any regime type, are the most impervious to public opinion. Therefore, I'm placing this probability at 1%. This consequently means the remaining probability falls under \"No\" -- 89%. Thoughts?
