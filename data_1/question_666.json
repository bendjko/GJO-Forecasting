The 36-foot-tall missile had a squat, snub-nosed frame and used a liquid propellent more powerful than the kerosene-based fuels the North Koreans had used in the past, potentially allowing it to fly farther, with heavier payloads.\nThe missile was dubbed the Hwasong-10, or Musudan. But experts noted striking similarities to the R-27 Zyb, or Ripple, manufactured by the Makeyev Rocket Design Bureau. Two months later, on Aug. 24, 2016, North Korea successfully tested the Pukguksong-1, a submarine-launched missile that also incorporates some features from the Zyb. Both models are \u201cgenerally regarded as derived from the designs of the Makeyev Bureau\u2019s R-27,\u201d said Joshua Pollack, an analyst at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in Monterey, Calif.\nThose two tests were followed in recent months by even greater technological leaps, culminating in the successful tests this year of North Korea\u2019s first true intercontinental ballistic missiles, capable of reaching every city in the continental United States. There have been no further tests of the Musudan, but satellite images released this month show that North Korea is building floating barges thought to be intended for tests of new submarine-launched missiles. The construction is occurring in two different ports on opposite sides of the country.\nU.S. analysts also believe that North Korea is working on an improved version of the Pukguksong.\" 38 North, December 19, 'Sinpo South Shipyard: Is the GORAE Set to Sail?': http://www.38north.org/2016/12/sinpo111916/ Affirming forecast.

Looking back at activities in Iran on their nuclear program, it's at least possible. Clearly there are activities ongoing in the ballistic submarine and SLBM area. Buildling a ballistic submarine would suggest also the development of the launching mechanism - with a possible test. There's a lot of propaganda going on from all sides, so it's hard to extract thruth from intentional rumours. \nhttps://www.38north.org/2017/11/sinpo111617/\nhttp://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/north-koreas-ballistic-missile-submarine-major-threat-or-23308"], [41637, "2017-11-25T09:57:29Z", [0.04], ""], [41463, "2017-11-25T09:35:03Z", [1.0], ""], [1034, "2017-11-25T07:43:06Z", [0.0], ""], [34920, "2017-11-25T07:31:06Z", [0.0], ""], [34920, "2017-11-25T07:30:51Z", [1.0], ""], [41648, "2017-11-25T03:16:37Z", [0.5], ""], [29646, "2017-11-24T23:43:53Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-11-24T19:22:21Z", [0.0], ""], [83, "2017-11-24T19:01:37Z", [0.0], ""], [22264, "2017-11-24T16:48:13Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-11-24T16:32:42Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-11-24T16:13:20Z", [0.0], ""], [23536, "2017-11-24T12:58:40Z", [0.5], ""], [2965, "2017-11-24T02:30:11Z", [0.0], ""], [82, "2017-11-24T02:15:29Z", [0.0], ""], [97, "2017-11-24T01:50:56Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-11-24T01:20:52Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-11-24T01:16:42Z", [0.0], ""], [10745, "2017-11-24T01:07:03Z", [0.0], ""], [41634, "2017-11-23T22:31:24Z", [0.01], ""], [11800, "2017-11-23T19:14:35Z", [0.03], "to be watched closely in the following days and weeks http://www.38north.org/2017/11/sinpo111617/ Thanks to @fisherdbus "], [11800, "2017-11-23T19:08:54Z", [0.03], ""], [29646, "2017-11-23T18:01:31Z", [0.0], ""], [39926, "2017-11-23T15:02:39Z", [0.07], ""], [30298, "2017-11-23T13:14:38Z", [0.05], ""], [23779, "2017-11-23T11:14:17Z", [0.0], ""], [27, "2017-11-23T11:04:30Z", [0.03], ""], [368, "2017-11-23T00:03:54Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-11-22T23:58:48Z", [0.0], ""], [31450, "2017-11-22T22:32:31Z", [0.03], "Dropping further as it seems North Korea has quieted down in the last few months and because I think if anything a barge test is more likely."], [29646, "2017-11-22T21:34:59Z", [0.0], ""], [41589, "2017-11-22T18:57:26Z", [0.15], ""], [15548, "2017-11-22T17:24:30Z", [0.0], ""], [37744, "2017-11-22T15:30:12Z", [0.23], "Recent activity shows movement along the ports suggesting platforms are being put together to be test.

This is partially because they have been testing SLBM missiles from land sites and have only recently transitioned to sea based launches.  Instead of counting the number of SLBM launches, we should be analyzing the total number of tests of the Pukkuksong, which is North Korea's main SLBM.   Here is a list of the relevant launches:  Year:  Launches (Sea based)\n2014: 3 (1)\n2015:  5 (3)\n2016:  3 (2)\n2017:  2 (1) You'll notice a clear research testing distribution (starts with few launches, increases, and then declines when success are regular enough). Moreover, following the May 2017 launch of the land-based Pukguksong-2, North Korea announced that:\n1)  this would be the upgraded version of the SBLM and \n2) Mass production would soon begin soon The only question that remains is:  When the Pukguksong-2 comes off the assembly line, will North Korea find it necessary to conduct a Submarine test launch.  As a reminder, the Pukguksong-2 has only ever been fired from land.  However, I contest that it is not necessary to conduct a sea based test since its technical specs are similar and an upgraded version to the Pukguksong-1 that they have fired repeatedly.  Moreover, I'm not certain they would want to test fire from a submarine in the near term since a failure would entirely change our perception of their SLBM arsenal.

The submarine has not entered operational use and is the only North Korean submarine capable of launching the KN11/Pukguksong-1 submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM). U.S. intelligence assesses the submarine\u2019s submerged displacement to be approximately 2,000 tons.\nThe Gorae-class submarine has seen improvements as recently as this year. Early in the summer, the submarine was fitted with a new launch tube, The Diplomat has learned.\nIt is unknown if the launch tube is meant to accommodate the extant Pukguksong-1 SLBM or whether the Gorae-class may soon operate a newer SLBM that may require a redesigned launch tube, with the Pukguksong-1 potentially retired for a newer missile.\nNorth Korea released potential evidence in late-August of a new solid-fuel SLBM, the Pukguksong-3, though the existence of this missile remains unconfirmed by U.S. intelligence.\nA new North Korean SLBM may feature an advanced airframe using lighter composite materials that could lead to it exhibiting a considerably greater total range than the first-generation Pukguksong-1.\nThis summer, North Korea carried out repeated SLBM ejection tests at its test stand near the Sinpo shipyard where the Gorae-class is ported and where the Sinpo-C submarine is under construction.\"\nU.S. intelligence recorded ejection tests on May 30, July 18, July 25, and July 30. No ejection new tests have taken place at Sinpo since July. Ejection tests allow North Korean engineers to verify the operation of the missile\u2019s cold-launch system, which pushes the missile through the sea\u2019s surface before its engines ignite.\nPrior to North Korea\u2019s second ICBM test in July, U.S. intelligence had assessed that a new SLBM flight test was likely. This assessment was revised downward in August following North Korea\u2019s second ICBM test in late-July. As of early October, an SLBM flight test was not seen as imminent by U.S. intelligence.
