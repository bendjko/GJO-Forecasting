Besides border disputes and a minor refugee crisis, Bangladesh appears to be the safest of all the at risk nations of the Early Warning Project.  The country is populated by 161 million people, and compared to the other at risk nations, the ethnic groups are homogeneous.  If I were forced to choose a country to visit on the Early Warning Project list of at risk nations, Bangladesh is my top choice.  There has been a handful of acute violent acts targeting civilians, but world players are paying close attention and funding Bangladeshis' infrastructure projects.
