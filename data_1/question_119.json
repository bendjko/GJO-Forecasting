This forecast is partly me playing the game (GJ), as I looked at the consensus around the three candidate who have a chance tomorrow and partly what I think the actual chances are for the candidates tomorrow. Given the likely consensuses around the three candidates tonight, it makes sense to really under-forecast for Rubio (I have him at 3%, crowd at 12%) because I don't really think that the polling is THAT far off that he'll surpass BOTH Trump AND Cruz tomorrow. Despite the Cruz mailers, I think he's the likeliest (of the two frontrunners) to overachieve the polls. My \"ace in the hole\" on this is something -- somewhat ironically -- from Monkey Cage: \"Ted Cruz has an under-appreciated strength in Iowa\" --> https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/01/31/ted-cruz-has-an-under-appreciated-strength-in-iowa/  Excerpt: And the Iowa endorsements leader is clearly Cruz. He has 26 percent of the endorsements (12 total), while Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Carly Fiorina have eight each (17 percent), Chris Christie has six (13 percent), John Kasich has two (4 percent), and Ben Carson, Rick Santorum and Donald Trump each have a single endorsement (1 percent). Cruz\u2019s endorsement lead is consistent with the conventional wisdom that he has underlying strength in the Iowa caucus, despite Trump\u2019s apparent lead in the race. ~~~ COMMENT: So, with Cruz in the \"endorsement\" lead for state legislators, I think that will help him with the GOTV campaign tomorrow. I've got him pegged at 45% (consensus is at 34%).  Lastly, Trump. I'm still aghast that Trump could actually win a state, but in the face of overwhelming evidence, I can't help but play the game and raise his percentage a few points above the consensus (I have him at 52% and the consensus has him at 49%). \n~~ I thought this might also be a good place to \"timestamp\" my prediction for tomorrow night.

If Trump  is expecting a surge in new voters (seems Trump needs this more than Sanders) then at least as far as the data that are available he is not getting it. Notice in the graph of Republican voters, in December there is actually a FALL OFF in registrations compared to November.  That should not be happening at that point, I don't think. (EDIT: it is noted that this is probably due to a purge of inactive prior registrations--suggests not much replacement with new voters). The biggest caveat is that voters can register up to the day of the caucus. But the fact that it is below even 2012 numbers (Romney!) at this point is a warning signal, n'est pas? I have been bullish on Trump as far a poll numbers, but polls do not matter if Bubba does not get off the couch, wipe the Cheetos off his chest, put on a shirt and goes to the polling site. http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/29/upshot/surge-for-sanders-or-trump-in-iowa-voter-registration-doesnt-suggest-it.html?rref=upshot&smid=tw-upshotnyt&smtyp=cur"], [16973, "2016-01-28T12:35:24Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.45, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.0, 0.45], ""], [16836, "2016-01-28T12:21:24Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.3, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.0, 0.6], ""], [691, "2016-01-28T12:04:27Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.52, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.04, 0.0, 0.44], ""], [241, "2016-01-28T11:12:22Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.35, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.65], ""], [15953, "2016-01-28T09:55:03Z", [0.05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.25, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.25, 0.05, 0.25], "Other poll here predict DT at 25% https://www.gjopen.com/questions/38-will-donald-trump-win-iowa-s-republican-caucus# which is a huge difference with 53.8% here, why?"], [12874, "2016-01-28T09:28:36Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.75], ""], [506, "2016-01-28T09:21:26Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.75], ""], [17080, "2016-01-28T08:56:51Z", [0.07, 0.12, 0.05, 0.01, 0.2, 0.02, 0.01, 0.02, 0.07, 0.15, 0.0, 0.28], ""], [506, "2016-01-28T08:47:54Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.45, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.55], ""], [17555, "2016-01-28T08:36:44Z", [0.03, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.25, 0.01, 0.55], ""], [17834, "2016-01-28T08:34:36Z", [0.07, 0.05, 0.05, 0.04, 0.23, 0.06, 0.04, 0.02, 0.04, 0.07, 0.09, 0.24], ""], [13997, "2016-01-28T08:30:44Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.8], "If it's true that the Republican party would prefer Trump to Cruz at this stage, then I expect the caucus process to produce a win for Trump in spite of the fact that he doesn't have as strong an organisation on the ground as Cruz.

So this suggests downgrading Rubio's chances further and writing off Bush (7.8%) and Carson (6.2%) completely in IA.  How much of a role will weather play? It's hard to say. I suspect the correct null hypothesis is that weather will have no effect.
