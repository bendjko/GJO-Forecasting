Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid described the relationship as \u201cjust political.\u201d\nBut the revelation coincides with other Russian moves in Afghanistan that appear aimed, as in the Middle East and Europe, at undermining U.S. influence and seeking regional parity with Washington.\nThe Kremlin held a conference in Moscow last month with China and Pakistan to discuss terrorist threats from Afghanistan and how to combat Islamic State. Since then, Russia has invited the Afghan government to participate in the continuing diplomatic initiative, but not the U.S.\nMoscow also has blocked the Afghan government\u2019s efforts to remove Gulbuddin Hekmatyar from a United Nations sanctions list, a crucial condition of an Afghan government peace deal with the warlord\u2019s al Qaeda-linked insurgent group. The deal, strongly supported by the U.S. and its allies, was viewed by the U.S. and other allies of the government as a template for future talks with the Taliban.\nWhile the Afghan government of President Ashraf Ghani has publicly criticized any support for the Taliban, one of the biggest boosters of Russian moves in Afghanistan is his predecessor, Hamid Karzai (para. 1-7).

With a second close call in losing the important provincial capital of Kunduz to the Taliban, in addition to a dangerously close skirmish over Lashkar Gah in Helmand Province, the Afghan government managed to hold on to major urban hubs, while nonetheless conceding more remote territory to the militant group. The Taliban suffered important blows. In particular, a U.S. drone strike succeeded in killing Mullah Akhtar Mohammed Mansour in Pakistan\u2019s Balochistan province in May 2016, leading to the group\u2019s second leadership transition in two years. Outside of the Taliban, Afghanistan\u2019s economy continues to struggle with unemployment and non-foreign-aid-based growth. A controversial peace deal with Gulbuddin Hekmatyar\u2019s Hezb-e-Islami armed group has been pitched as a victory for the cause of reconciliation in the country, but its long-term viability remains to be seen (para. 14).

The war began as a response to the 9/11 attacks.\n\"To have a stable security partner that is eager and willing to work with the United States is an asset for the future for us,\" Carter said (para. 1-5).\nThe U.S. has about 10,000 troops in Afghanistan to train and advise Afghan security forces combatting a resilient Taliban insurgency. U.S. special operations forces are hunting down al-Qaida and Islamic State militants (para. 8).\nCarter's visit comes amid concerns that despite improvements in Afghan government defenses, Taliban forces are gaining leverage and are continuing to use neighboring Pakistan as a sanctuary. By U.S. estimates, the Afghan government controls slightly less than two-thirds of the country's population.\nThe Taliban holds sway over about 10 percent, and the remainder of the population is \"contested.\"\nThe top US commander in Afghanistan said Friday \"the fundamental logic\" of the U.S. counterterrorism mission is solid, suggesting it should continue after the change of administrations (para. 8-11).

Afghans are being left to fight their own fight. A surging Taliban insurgency, meanwhile, is flush with a new inflow of money.\nWith their nation\u2019s future at stake, Afghan leaders have renewed a plea to one power that may hold the key to whether their country can cling to democracy or succumbs to the Taliban. But that power is not the United States.\nIt is Saudi Arabia.\nSaudi Arabia is critical because of its unique position in the Afghan conflict: It is on both sides.\nA longtime ally of Pakistan, Saudi Arabia has backed Islamabad\u2019s promotion of the Taliban. Over the years, wealthy Saudi sheikhs and rich philanthropists have also stoked the war by privately financing the insurgents.\nAll the while, Saudi Arabia has officially, if coolly, supported the American mission and the Afghan government and even secretly sued for peace in clandestine negotiations on their behalf.\nThe contradictions are hardly accidental. Rather, they balance conflicting needs within the kingdom, pursued through both official policy and private initiative.\nThe dual tracks allow Saudi officials plausibly to deny official support for the Taliban, even as they have turned a blind eye to private funding of the Taliban and other hard-liners Sunni groups.\nThe result is that the Saudis \u2014 through private or covert channels \u2014 have tacitly supported the Taliban in ways that make the kingdom an indispensable power broker.\nIn interviews with The New York Times, a former Taliban finance minister described how he traveled to Saudi Arabia for years raising cash while ostensibly on pilgrimage.\nThe Taliban have also been allowed to raise millions more by extorting \u201ctaxes\u201d by pressing hundreds of thousands of Pashtun guest workers in the kingdom and menacing their families back home, said Vali Nasr, a former State Department adviser (pra. 1-11).

That is despite the extended presence of nearly 10,000 American troops in the country, tasked with performing counterterrorism operations and supporting the Afghan forces who are bearing the brunt of the fighting.\nGen. Joseph L. Votel, the chief of the United States Central Command, said the Afghan government now controls only about 60 percent of the country, the Taliban hold sway over about 10 percent, and the remainder is contested. Which group or groups fill those voids of increasing ungoverned territory in Afghanistan \u201cis something we\u2019ll have to contend with,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe have to be concerned about this \u2014 about the Taliban pulling together and cooperating and collaborating with other terrorist organizations,\u201d General Votel said at a security forum in Washington this week.\nOver all, Western and Afghan officials estimate that 40,000 to 45,000 militants are active across Afghanistan. The Taliban are estimated at 30,000 fighters, some of them seasonal. But the rest are foreign militants of different \u2014 and often fluid \u2014 allegiances, at times competing but mostly on the same side against the Afghan government and its American allies.\n\u201cOf the 98 U.S.- or U.N.-designated terrorist organizations around the globe, 20 of them are in the Af-Pak region,\u201d Gen. John W. Nicholson, the commander of American and NATO forces in Afghanistan, said recently. \u201cThis is the highest concentration of the numbers of different groups in any area in the world\u201d (para. 1-6).
