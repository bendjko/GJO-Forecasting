In a recent Florida poll, 44% of Floridians said that they think Rubio should drop out of the race. It seems unlikely that everyone else (56%)  is a strong Rubio supporter and would vote for Rubio over Trump, which is pretty close to what Rubio would need to beat Trump.  Also, although I am open to being wrong here and it is very possible that Trump's campaign doesn't align with campaign norms, it is worth noting that polling sites show that approval ratings for candidates after they win initial primaries tend to improve.

Even the latest Monmouth poll (which had Rubio within 8 points of Trump last week) is now showing Trump up by 17. While Trump often underperforms the polls by a couple of percentage points, the gap is still to big for another candidate to have a reasonable shot.

As of today, March 13, with 463 delegates out of the 1,049 delegates that have been won by all candidates combined, Trump is holding the narrowest lead of any Republican nomination contest in *forty years.*  2. Trump\u2019s base is not growing even as the field winnows.  3. Florida is a closed primary state, meaning only registered Republican may vote. Trump has lost two of the three closed primaries so far, and won by only a 3% plurality edge in Louisiana. I'm now placing my 100% bet on Rubio as Florida's favorite son.

First, Trump only at 51%?!  I'll tackle that later, but it is surprising to me.  Second, Cruz OVER Rubio?  (26 v 22%).  Can someone point me to a rationale for that?  I found lots of people giving Cruz high %'s, but no one defending it. A few short thoughts: 1)  Trump is currently up by a lot (20% in poll this AM, at least 8% in every poll that has been conducted).  http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/fl/florida_republican_presidential_primary-3555.html 2) Trump is at >70% in betting markets.  Cruz %-chance is in single digits (~5%).  http://predictwise.com/politics/2016-president-primaries 3)  CNN story on Rubio potentially dropping out pre-FL.  Campaign has denied, but it doesn't exactly scream \"momentum\".  It also forced them to triple down on \"we're not dropping out,\" so I would be floored if they turned around and dropped out now.  Taken together, seems like they will stay in and lose to Trump :)  \nStory: http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/07/politics/marco-rubio-campaign-weighs-getting-out/index.html\nCampaign Denial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciuxY1jGHoI 4)  This election has been so unpredictable that I am hesitant to say anything definitive here.  I would note though it is very hard to rally support to a campaign when you consistently under-perform expectations.  I don't think I would be the first person to note that maybe Rubio receiving much \"establishment\" support without earning it (through wins) turned into more curse than blessing.   5) Setting aside Rubio v. Trump, Cruz at 26% is the most bewildering piece of consensus forecast here.  What's the bull case for Cruz?  I guess if Rubio dropped out I could see it, but watch his campaign mgr in youtube link above - I'd be very surprised if he did.  Or if Trump just imploded (which is possible, but unlikely).  Cruz has been doing very well in rural caucus states and places where having a superior ground game matters.  In FL though he is just beginning to open field offices (and is sending surrogates there vs. campaigning himself).  This article sums it up nicely - it is clearly an attack on Rubio, but does not seem like a play to win: http://www.politico.com/story/2016/03/florida-ted-cruz-marco-rubio-220409 .

The rule of unintended consequences may not predict another Hitler, but the possibility/probability that a major trade-war led by the US would not end well.

And only two of them show Trump with single digit advantages, the remaining 8 all give Trump a 10+ advantage over second place.\n- Rubio is second and is getting solid in second  Inside view: \n- Florida is a swing state (half blue, half red) as such Trump's results will be closer to what he got in Massachussets (Trump's biggest win until now) than what a got in Kansas or Oaklahoma. Trump performs better in progressive states than in conservative states. \n-Rubio will be second because it is his home state and he is slghtly more pregressive than Ted Cruz So: Trump: 80%\nRubio: 15%\nCruz: 5%"], [21722, "2016-03-07T17:55:00Z", [0.0, 0.88, 0.0, 0.12], ""], [18846, "2016-03-07T17:54:48Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [651, "2016-03-07T17:54:20Z", [0.3, 0.4, 0.1, 0.2], ""], [1229, "2016-03-07T17:48:49Z", [0.0, 0.8, 0.0, 0.2], ""], [21708, "2016-03-07T17:44:12Z", [0.06, 0.65, 0.0, 0.29], ""], [9939, "2016-03-07T17:35:32Z", [0.0, 0.95, 0.0, 0.05], ""], [20711, "2016-03-07T17:22:39Z", [0.05, 0.6, 0.0, 0.35], ""], [14296, "2016-03-07T17:20:01Z", [0.07, 0.62, 0.03, 0.28], ""], [1148, "2016-03-07T17:17:08Z", [0.35, 0.35, 0.05, 0.25], ""], [12630, "2016-03-07T17:11:05Z", [0.0, 0.88, 0.0, 0.12], ""], [532, "2016-03-07T17:09:26Z", [0.0, 0.85, 0.0, 0.15], ""], [8888, "2016-03-07T17:09:02Z", [0.05, 0.5, 0.05, 0.4], "The fact that Cruz has opened offices in Florida to stop Rubio may help Trump win the state.

They probably favour Trump heavily. How much do they matter? In 2012 there were only 1.6 million votes in total. Turnout in general is up 25%, so the early ballots probably reflect 30% of the final total. Assume they follow the current polling, in which Trump has a 15% lead over Rubio and a 30% lead over Cruz: then Trump has locked in a 4.5% advantage over Rubio and a 9% advantage over Cruz, meaning Rubio needs to beat Trump by 6.5% to catch up, and Cruz by 13%. That seems hard! (2) Rubio, Trump's main Florida rival, seems to be tanking. If anything, the party is considering lining up behind Cruz, which could split Rubio's vote without giving Cruz time to catch up. The Anti-Trump Case\n(1) Romney's appeal for every anti-Trump voter to vote Rubio, or some similar establishment plea, might be successful.\n(2) The Puerto Rico win might perhaps turn things around for Rubio?\n(3) Trump seems to underperform in closed primaries.\n(4) A wave of anti-Trump advertising might take. Overall, the model looks likely to understate Trump's odds, but not by very much. I'll also increase Cruz to reflect his recent momentum.
