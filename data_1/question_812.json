Shipp ruled in favor of the athletic leagues, and barred New Jersey from issuing sports betting licenses. The court ruled that under the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution, the regulation of gambling and the granting of a grandfather clause to four states is within Congress's power.[18][19] In September 2013, a three-judge panel from the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals voted 2-1 to uphold Shipp's decision.[20][21][needs update] Christie said he will appeal the case to the United States Supreme Court.[22] On June 27, 2017, the Supreme Court agreed to hear Christie v.

The leagues argued that a competing federal law, the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), prohibited any state government involvement in gambling on amateur or professional team games. New Jersey argued that its 2014 modifications removed the provisions allowing for legalized gambling on team games and that PASPA offered states no alternatives. By requiring states to prohibit actions that Congress itself could do by legislation, New Jersey argued that PASPA violated the Constitution's anti-commandeering doctrine, which states that \"Congress 'lacks the power directly to compel the States to require or prohibit' acts which Congress itself may require or prohibit.\"[3] A federal district court rejected New Jersey's argument.

That a State wishing to engage in certain activity must take administrative and sometimes legislative action to comply with federal standards regulating that activity is a commonplace that presents no constitutional defect.\" All in all, not a completely clear-cut case but I think New Jersey's argument that in this area there are no federal regulatory standards to comply with, will prevail.
