I just Picked HRC to win 100%\nErrors happen. I just want the record to reflect that there is no way I ever predicted DT as more than 50 prior to now.  made up my mind, with great reluctance I am voting for HRC right now in CA. Game over HRC takes 2 of 5 Fla,NC, NV, NH Ohio,  no path for DT. He needs to swamp all 5\n it will take a massive turnout and win 70% of non-college whites in all 3 and\n even if he did that,he loses.\nHe lost the moment he started attacking Hispanic immigrants and started attacking  women He lost FLA, NV, and PA for that long before the Access Hollywood video released and debates  confirmed  that\nComey cost HRC 2% and perhaps NH and NC and Dem control of Senate.\nWhether you are like WJ and believe that Comey should have continued criminal investigation as HRC is a felon.. or believe like me that HRC criminal charges area  joke as a practical and legal matter we all agree that the FBI Director cannot interfere in the political process. His comments back on 10-27 and new release are inexplicable unless\nComey knew NYC FBI agents leaked to WSJ the Weiner and apparently had to get out front\nWell the FBI agents were insubordinate to comey and may have committed felonies.\nComey cost HRC 2%, I have poll proof in NH, NV,and NC that tipped those states 2% enough to impact Senate races. Almost cost HRC election,and FBI interference in any federal election by leaks should be a felony. Comey needs to explain and clean up FBI.  If not, he should be held responsible and resign  . \n\nDT is racist and sexist and media went too far characterizing him  as a sexual predator.\nDT lost because he lied so much and engaged in intimidation of reporters. \nThat  is when the media focused on Trump  as an active opponent\nDT eliminated Hispanics, Asians and blacks and alienated 60% of all women voters from GOP forever.\nThe GOP is gone as a pres. power. Cannot win with white bases like Reagan,\nSO early voting in FLA reflects this surge of Hispanic and blacks outperformed even Obama in the early .Florida voting. 50% of the FLA vote is in, and I strongly suspect FLA is gone for DT.\nBut POTUS was in New Hampshire, FLOTUS, and POTUD and HRC and BILL IN PA and then HRC to NC.\nThat shows you the states they need to win, assuming FLA goes Trump.    How do we get job growth when robots and ai are building ships in Korea, cars will be made and driven by robots.\nEven AEI, a bastion of free market conservatism, has discussed a Basic Guaranteed income for all.\nHow can that be financed, as existing entitlement spending for SSA disabilty fund bankrupted it and ranferred paper obligations to the largest SSA pool projected for insolvency by 2025.\nPenson funds from CalPErs to  Fortune 500, all 50 states pension funds gone by 2025.\nWhy? low  interest rate have punished savers and retirees and future benefit recipents.  Low interest rates  have helped USG finance debt at lower costs. But when interest rates rise and\nfed expenditures follow trendline including ACA, increased defense spending will result in entitlements, defense, and interest payments for USG will approach 76%\nFed cannot solve problem, except by raising rates gradually. No one, not Paul Ryan, not HRC, no one has discussed this looming liquidity crunch.\nNo one has put forth a proposal other tham Ryan ( See Better Way agenda)  to even begin to deal\nwith the regulatory  reform, corporate tax reduction, and entitlement issues, especially for the 18-45 age group today.\nHRC will clearly be better, the easy choice for Commander in Chief, and I expect HRC will assert US power in Syria, Iraq, Poland, Balts.\nExpect a new cold war for a time,\n Russia needs West, these sanctions and oil prices have eliminated almost a 1/3 of all asset value.\n  But do not expect Putin and Lavrov to come to the table anytime soon with Secretary of State Biden.\n\nSo I expect more of the same from HRC, more tax and spend. I seem growth at best as 2.5% under HRC.\nThat will not solve the 2025 problem.\nHRC will assert US interests, support our treaty allies in NATO, Japan and ROK to the max.\nShe will follow a new version of Kennan's containment program for Russia. But Russia and US will come to the table. Russia is too important geo-poltically to exclude like Iran was  by sanctions.  We realized that was counter-productive, lifted Iran sanctions and now we have Boeing. EADS, and TOTAL ready to create jobs and growth for Iran and US and EU, Like JFK stated first inaugural, \"let us never negotiate out of fear and never fear to negotiate\"\nSo HRC pursue containments and now we can negotiate with leverage with Russia on Ukraine, Syria, and even arms control issues.\nSO I see HRC pursuing  theses objectives with the ruthlessness of Theodore Roosevelt,\n  Kissinger and  all former Sec States will support her.\nGood Luck HRC \nYou need with a Congress whose \" Freedom Caucus\" with  a stranglehold on Speaker Ryan has a policy of complete and total obstruction.

Comey has lost control of FBI.\nSo desperate to defend the indefensible, FBI sources are disclosing wire-tap on HRC staff member and these anonymous source did commit a federal felony. Better stay anonymous. Disclosing the existence of a wire tap as well as info from is a serious federal felony \nThese constant  unauthorized leaks are a violation of FBI RULES, DOJ Rules and US statute and US Supreme Court rulings for a political purpose. That is how desparate FBI key personel have become. This info like FBI 302s is confidential and highly unreliable. It took decades to dislodge Hoover and mak  the FBI accountable to Rule of law and non-poltical.\nClearly Comey has to go and now his agency has reverted back to a Poltical police force and this potentially will subvert  our justice system. I expect the leakers to suffer the same\ncharges and penalties that  they allege HRC should have. Plus obstrucion of justice. With these leaks, it will be impossible to convict anyone subject to this Keystone Cop-GRU investigation.     \nHRC polls are showing Trump crossing trend line in Iowa and Florida, and VA and NC\nd Iowa those states appear gone. But Nevada is a toss up-likely Clinton as with VA and NC and New Hampshire\n SO just as in Brexit we have trendlines crossing in 5 key battleground states.\nBut I give DT AZ, GA, FLA,Ohio, \nThis race will be determined not in FLA or Ohio but in NC, Nevada, PA, and VA, and NH\nDT needs to win PA, he is far short. Clinton can win so many ways.\nBut HRC still has 6 paths to 272.\n Trump must still run table. He needs PA, cannot get.\nHRC needs PA and Virginia and Colorado which are makeable. \nDT needs NC , VA and FLA and NH to win and Ohio\nNo way, assuming Dems equal turnout from Obama.\nEarly voting means nothing in those states, unless you assume the voters are highly partisan and voted early out of intense opposition.\nPlease be clear, there is still a 1 in 20 chance to  5 in 20 chance DT will win.\nSo a forecaster could be between 75-95 for HRC BASED ON TURNOUT ASSUMPTIONs\nHRC wins as DT had no ground qame, will be outspent 3/1 in more battleground  states.\nHRC ground qame will win VA, NV, NC, PA, Comey came very close to killing Clinton's candidacy.\nGuess what? HRC for legal purposes under the draconian national security laws,\n as a matter of law  HRC had no intent and her conduct must be assessed  not by the standards of military but by State and specifically the pattern and practice of Secretary Rice and Powell.\n\n Comey may have fought the deep state for John Ashcroft and the US  when he refused to sign off on secret NSC findings for torture and  non-FISA authorized or FISA court ordered NSA surveillance of US citizens, physically present in US  and  not in communications with actors outside US.\nBut  he is not a hero, he is a Nero.\nContrary to what you may read and hear.... \n Comey's actions signifcantly deviate  from past practice. Tom Fuentes on CNN is a shill for FBI.\nDo not trust or watch him ever!! Just like a  Trump surrogate. No expert he is advocate for FBI and every police homicide . Do not know  his comments in last week.predict not one word of criticism of FBI or Comey    \nUnprecedented for the FBI director to formally announce the end of any investigation for  so many reasons. Comey cannot immunize HRC from criminal charges.\nHe as FBI director  and cannot  bind the USAG or any US attorney to prosecute or not prosecute. His initial announcement was flawed. He knew then that Putin via Assange was leaking  in stages information stolen by espionage. He knew that Huma  had laptops and hard drives relevant to the investigation. \nComey knew or should have had subponaed before his announcement Wieners records and hard drives  \nHe was Huma's husband and due to Wiener texting proclivities, that data should have  been seized long before Coney made any announcement, it was known to exist and my routine as prosecutor as Chief Deputy State AG was to get that data and all data first with sealed subpoenas ( not public) I would have been presenting the data as discovered and the deletes as discovered, to a Grand Jury.\nI  would have  been termed on the spot if I had a press conference, announced investigation at an end, no intent, The investigation should have been secret all along, the only matter that would have been disclosed, would have been a  grand jury indictment or no comment. Having made the extraordinary assertion that the investigation ( which never should have been  disclosed) was closed (which is false and contrary to USADOJ best practices and grounds for term.)  that there was noof evidence of intent, he then  offered up the assessment that HRC was profoundly \"reckless\" with classified info. That  may have been true, but reckless is enough to indict for intent. So he blackened HRC with a finding that never should have been  public and was a basis for House  Repub criticism. When Comey went up to the HIll he was incomprensible, I just read the transcript. never should have made any comment at any time and if he did, the only appropriate comment was no comment. \nNow, the claim that Comey just got the rec from the Huma  and Weiner investigators. While technically true; Comey knew that info was out there all along and had a duty, a critical time sensitive one to get the  case to  DOJ Crim Division head. The Assistant AG Criminal would have taken the evidence to a  DC Federal  Grand Jury which would have not returned an indictment. That is why US brings very few FISA or espionage or  disclosure of class info or Khalid  cases wth deep state implications except in the Nothern District\nof VA in Alexandria not DC or Maryland.  Why? The supervising appellate court the Fourth US Circuit Court of Appeals may have the most pro-governmen bias. Seems DOJ can do no wrong in VA orNC. The jurors are way way more conservative than DC or Maryland. So Comey states publicly that there was an investigation closed for lack of intent and then states HRC \"reckless\" which for legal purpose is evidence of intent or represents intent. Sicnce them Comey has been under relentless assault from pro-Trump FBI agents and supervising officers  and Congress to indict Clinton. These comparisons to  General Petraeus and General Cartwright are not apt or appropriate. What each did was a clear and repeated disclsosure of classified info. Why did Petraus take a misdo, he was guilty in law and fact. He got a break and deserved better.\nCartwright explained the Stuxnet bot story of the cyber-attack with David Sanger of NYT.  But Generals sign different non-disclosure agreements, just like a Snowden that SecState is not subject to. Both should have been pardoned by Obama,and even if it takes an act of Congress, each should be reinstated,and if they chose to retire it would be at the same grade and terms as if the conviction did not occur. We have many great Generals but we cannot afford to leave these great Generals in a position where they cannot serve the US in any capacity. Only 1 cabinet level appointee resigned andr was prosecuted  before Nixon. ( tea pot dome scandal-Harding. After Watergate, the AG ( John Mitchell) was convicted of a felony. His successor a truly  nice man, RIchard Kleindeinst pled to a MIsdemeanor. ( I still question whether he was good for that. I would have insisted on a jury trial for AG Kleindeinst, but the  public climate was so hostile and  he was worn down by Watergate as AG and probably decided to plea due to risk of conviction by unfair jury and keep his law license. Maurice Stans Sec. of Commerce convicted of felony as well. During Bill Clinton, the HUD secretary and the Sec. of Commerce were charged with public justice offenses. Clearly guilty Cisneros was finished polically. Then there were Tyson payoffs to a Cabinet member, no conviction just resignation. Now, we have not indicted VP Cheney and CIA personnel who engaged in unauthorized torture ( only John Yee could believe torture could be authorized) during Bush II. Many CIA agents are known  to be fugitives of justice from Italy and have been convicted in absentia by Italy. Cheney cannot leave US.\nEven in UK he would be arrested and sent to the Spain and Belgium for trial. See for yourself.Neither Bush II or Cheney have left the US for a nation in EU.  President Obama was correct to direct DOJ not to prosecute any of these crimes which was to close the book, not prosecute some clearly guilty CIA officers, especially Rodriquez. Why, these crimes must be seen in the post 9-11 context and were authorized expressly or implictly by Bush II or Cheney as Yee at the time at DOJ-OLC  expressed a Hiltlerian \"unitary executive\" where any act even a war crime can be authorized by POTUS as Commander in Chief. Such a legal doctrine violates express provisions of US law, the Constitution, case law, Jones v. Clinton and US v Nixon. It is fundamental to the US Constitution that no President is immune or above the law, even in wartime. See Ex Parte Milligan and Ex Parte Valldingham where the US Supreme Court held that President Lincoln  violated  the rights of these Southern sympathizers when he arrested each and banished same from Union Territory.\nIf Yees is correct, and he is now a tenured law professor at Berkely,POTUS could order anyone to violate the Geneva Convention and be immune so long as they were following orders from POTUS. This perverse and fascist ideology was rejected at Nuremberg. If Yee is correct. each of the Nuremberg defedants would have been acquitted and not hung. Following orders is no defense to any crime.\nGeneral Hayden is aware and has complied. He was never a target and as much as I sometimes disagree wtih the Gen.; he has and does understand. Obama directed AG  not to  prosecute. so that Gen Hayden and so many others tainted by Bush II, unfairly could proceed with vital national security work.\nGen. Hayden and Secretary Gates could well have been indicted by an over-zealous federal prosector and while the charges would be dismissed, any USD Judge would toss; such a climate of fear and witch hunt would have destroyed the intelligence capabilities of US just when we needed same for survival as a nation. And Scooter Libby and Poindexter and the infamous Ollie North, all walked free or were acquitted at trial in DC  or on appeal to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. Well Comey altered the trajectory of  one of the most contested and critical US pres elections.\nComey  is required to be independent and is not a prosecutor. While Mr. Comey has an outstanding record, has served the US ably as a US attorney for SDNY Manhattan. He was the predecessor to Mary Jo White, now SEC Chairman. Comey served AG Ashcroft as chief Deputy AG with distinction. he was appointed FBI Director by Obama. As a life-long federal prosecutor even as a Repubican,he seems to have been a model FBI Director.\nNot anymore. \nComey altered this election trajectory, incalcuably and irreversbly; on 2 occasions.\nThe mere disclosure of the investigation of HRC and his comments about \"recklessness\"\nwere terrrble violations of long-standing DOJ and FBI protocols and procedures.\nThe Second disclosure last week was overtly political, no FBI Director has  the authority under the law to disclose an investigation is ongoing,that it was concluded  with no criminal indictment but HRC was \"reckless\" and the disclosure of the reopening of the investigation of Clinton based on Weiner, is so implausible, so much like covering his ass or protecting himself, not the institutional interests of the FBI. Certainly not in the interests of justice. Trump supporters will think I am biased-far from it. Trumps returns for the last 10 year are under audit, that was disclosed by Trump as a reason not to disclose them as every candidate has released taxes since Watergate. You did  not hear one word from the IRS or its Commisioner John Koskinen, a Republican whipping boy over the Lois Lerner affair.\nNever once did the IRS comment on the fact of the audit, the nature of the audit, or even a word except clarifying that Mr. Trump's assertion that he could not reveal them was patently false. It would have been easy for IRS to smear and even  indict Trump.\nWe can only guess his returns but its not the failure to pay taxes that is relevant.\nTrump has 2 LLCs in the BVI that came out in the Panama papers dump. The address of both is Trump Tower. As a result I am positive that not only abused tax shelters and owes hudreds of mllions in back taxes and penalties and perhaps felonies, all foreign bank accounts had to be disclosed no later than May 2016. Trump LLCs with headquarters at Trump  Towers are US have a US domicile. Well thats 2 felonies it is likely that Trump Committed, tax evasion and failure to disclose all foreign bank accounts\nSo Trump is probably a felon and certainly has had financial dealing with Russia state actors James Comey,  did not follow DOJ-FBI procedure.   Comey knew of the Documented ongoing efforts of Putin to manipulate this pres election with Assange, Wki-leaks and cvber hacks, criminal conduct.

I do think that a lot of middle and working class whites who are registered and have until now not bothered to vote may show up this year and vote for Trump. Trump is the first candidate in the lifetime of most voters who has said what those voters are thinking about immigration, trade, and offshoring. Given that they never previously had a chance to vote for a candidate who they thought represented them, turnout models and poll weighting based on 2012 figures may not be adequate to predict the outcome of this election.

The words may or may not be grammatically correct, but are semantically confused to the point that the listener cannot extract any meaning from them. The term is often used in psychiatry as well as in theoretical linguistics to describe a type of grammatical acceptability judgment by native speakers, and in computer programming to describe textual randomization. Word salad may describe a symptom of neurological or psychiatric conditions in which a person attempts to communicate an idea, but words and phrases that may appear to be random and unrelated come out in an incoherent sequence instead. Often, the person is unaware that he or she did not make sense. It appears in people with dementia and schizophrenia, as well as after anoxic brain injury. Clang associations are especially characteristic of mania, as seen in bipolar disorder, as a somewhat more severe variation of flight of ideas. In extreme mania, the patient's speech may become incoherent, with associations markedly loosened, thus presenting as a veritable word salad.\nSource: Wikipedia He does like 'em young: Donald Trump To Young Girl \"I Will Be Dating Her In 10 Years\u201d 1992 Video Interview:\nhttps://youtu.be/bjxMrhiyVDQ CNN, October 20, 'Donald Trump: 'I will totally accept' election results 'if I win': http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/20/politics/donald-trump-i-will-totally-accept-election-results-if-i-win/\nComments: 'nuff said.....

About 10,000 more Republicans than Democrats have voted by mail, according to the Florida secretary of state, a shrinking lead compared with past elections. Nearly 240,000 votes have been cast in Georgia, 216,000 in Iowa, 169,000 in Michigan and 129,000 in Virginia.  Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, Robby Mook, said again this week that the volume of early voting indicated the country was on track for a record turnout \u2014 which he believes would point to a Clinton win. \"Voter registration data and early vote data has shown us often exceeding trends on the 2012 campaign,\" he said.\" Politico, October 16, 'Early voting reveals warning signs for Trump - Democrats are ahead of their 2012 pace in several states the GOP nominee can't afford to lose.': http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/donald-trump-early-voting-clinton-229835\nClip from above Politico article:\n\"The early-voting performance in Iowa and Ohio tracks with polls showing Trump better positioned in those two states than in North Carolina and Florida. Likewise, in the two Southern states, where Clinton is ahead, according to POLITICO Battleground States polling averages, Democrats report sharp increases in absentee ballot requests from Hispanic, African-American and female voters.\nThe problem for Trump is that Ohio (18) and Iowa (6) have just 24 electoral votes between them, while North Carolina (15) and Florida (29) together offer 44.\nSo far, women are requesting ballots at a far faster rate than men in both North Carolina and Florida. That works to Clinton\u2019s advantage \u2014 according to the most recent Fox News poll, Clinton had a 19-point advantage over Trump with female voters.\nAnd Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told reporters in a press call Thursday that 180,000 Hispanic Floridians who didn\u2019t vote in 2014 had requested mail-in ballots. (Clinton leads Trump by 24 points among likely Hispanic voters in Florida, according to a recent poll conducted for the conservative-leaning Associated Industries of Florida business group.) \"One wild card, the U.S. Election Project\u2019s McDonald noted, is Trump\u2019s threat to launch a scorched-earth campaign against Clinton over the next three weeks. Though Trump may need to do that to claw his way back after falling behind in recent national polls, that strategy risks activating dormant Democrats in the Midwest, where polls show him tied or clinging to narrow leads.\n\u201cTrump\u2019s better off letting sleeping dogs lie. If you just let them continue what they\u2019re doing, he\u2019s in good shape [in Iowa and Ohio],\u201d he said. \u201cBy trying to tear down Clinton in the other states, he could inadvertently activate these people. If partisans perceive an attack on their candidate is unfair, that could cause them to rally. If Trump is going to kick the dog, it may end up waking up and biting him.\u201d Politico, October 14, 'Early ballots and voter-registration numbers show Democrats surging in Florida': http://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2016/10/fla-early-ballots-and-voter-registration-numbers-show-democrats-surging-in-fla-106392\nClips from Politico article:\n\"The numbers underscore how much stronger Clinton\u2019s ground game is in Florida and how weak the Republican National Committee\u2019s is on behalf of Donald Trump, longtime Florida political consultants say. If Trump loses Florida, he can\u2019t win the White House. And polls already show that Clinton is starting to move farther ahead of the Republican in Florida.\nJust two months ago, RNC spokesman Sean Spicer was claiming the opposite about the GOP\u2019s strength when he wrote a memo that accused Democrats of \u201csleight of hand\u201d in boasting about their superior number of field offices.\n\u201cThe Clinton camp knows that the Trump campaign and the RNC\u2019s combined efforts are outpacing their field organization, and their touting how many offices they have cannot cover up the fact they lag behind our effort in organizers, volunteers, and voter registration in key states,\u201d Spicer wrote.\nLongtime Florida Republican consultant Rick Wilson \u2014 a leading critic of Trump within the party \u2014 scoffed at Spicer\u2019s memo in light of the voter-registration and absentee-ballot numbers.\n\u201cThey\u2019re lying sacks of shit,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThere is no real Republican ground game in Florida.

Previously I laid out 4 scenarios related to wikileaks, which I believe has the best chance of swaying the election away from a Hillary victory. 1, Assange is blowing hot air. The leaks have nothing. Just a rude or ambiguous statement here and there. Currently leaks have already produced more scandals so this is not going to happen. 2, The leaks bring more scandals, but no true bombshells. This is the current state of things. However, these will not be enough, and get minimal media attention, effectively 0% Trump win. 3, A serious bombshell that the press cannot ignore, that puts her on the defensive. 70% Trump victory. 4, The atomic warhead of bombshells. Obama himself can no longer justify letting her walk free. 100% Trump victory. So far the leaks have been on par with scenario 2 with no signs of moving to scenario 3, although Wikileaks may have been planning to save the best for later. However this brings me to an issue I failed to consider earlier. If the material wikileaks has is scenario 3 or 4, then the campaign and the gov are most likely well aware of what wikileaks has and is more likely to take action to stop the leaks from happening. There is some evidence this has started to happen, or that wikileaks expects it to, based on their most recent tweets, consisting of a serious of hashes and a tweet claiming Assange has had his internet cut. EDIT: The latest batch has been released. First, although scenario 3 and 4 are more likely to provoke US intervention, it is still a possibility that they would act in a scenario 2, both to hide non election swaying scandals, and to discourage future leaks that could prove worse. Second, wikileaks has publicized the fact that they are prepared for US intervention, in the form of insurance files and dead mans switches. However, there is no guarantee the US will not be able to discover and disable these in time to stop them. Thus, the chance of scenario 3 and 4 producing a Trump victory will be reduced. Third, I feel I initially gave scenario 2 too low a chance of happening, although the recent events mentioned above would knock it back down a bit. If the leaks stop and don't continue again in a week, and no insurance file keys are released, I will assume nothing more will be released prior to the election. If the leaks do continue again, and the Hillary campaign begins attacking Trump even more heavily, or the US gov takes further action against wikileaks, Ecuador, Russia, or does something else drastic, then I'll assume scenario 3 and 4 are more likely, while not discounting that the flow of leaks could be stopped again.

Looking at polling accuracy for Aug/Sept and October/November, I found a few interesting things. First, we can discount a third party win as virtually statistically impossible at this point - it has not happened in modern times, and the current 3rd parties see very little support.  What's interesting is that going back to 1960, in every case but one (Carter/Reagan '80), the person ahead in the polls in October won the general election. Even more interesting, the percentage carried by the person *ahead* in October is - on average - bang-on what percentage of the popular vote they carried in the general election. HOWEVER, the percentage of the votes carried by the October *loser* were, on average four percentage points *higher* - possibly due to some sort of voter turnout effect possibly cause by the late polls (I need to look into this further).  Current polls for October average Clinton at 47.8% and Trump at 42.8%. On average, Clinton's score should not change much, and Trump's should *increase* by 4% (again, this is averaging across the last 56 years), which would put them at 47.7% (there is a tiny downward adjustment on average for the October lead) and 46.3%, effectively. Since it's virtually certain that this group of voters will elect the next president, that leaves Clinton with 51% of the voters who count, and Trump with 49% of the voters who count.  There is still a lot of randomness in this campaign that makes that narrow margin subject to huge shifts. Voter turnout could seriously affect the outcome, so that is where both parties need to focus their efforts. Corollary: I dove down a bit deeper into the mechanics of the polls on RCP, and the current October Polls, when correcting for relative size of the polls, taking the best and worst case scenarios for each candidate (given the MOE), and then adjusting as per the historical Polls-to-Popular vote, then taking the average of the best and worst cases, I came up with Clinton finishing with 45.4% of the popular vote to Trump's 43.8%. Assuming these will be the only votes that count (obviously), that doesn't change the overall prediction - 50.9% chance of a Clinton win vs 49.1% for Trump"], [16291, "2016-10-12T22:18:32Z", [0.04, 0.0, 0.96], ""], [16760, "2016-10-12T21:59:35Z", [0.2, 0.0, 0.8], ""], [368, "2016-10-12T21:48:54Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [12879, "2016-10-12T21:48:42Z", [0.09, 0.0, 0.91], ""], [28531, "2016-10-12T21:13:57Z", [0.19, 0.0, 0.81], ""], [23117, "2016-10-12T19:41:21Z", [0.09, 0.0, 0.91], ""], [691, "2016-10-12T19:11:23Z", [0.02, 0.0, 0.98], ""], [10916, "2016-10-12T18:56:53Z", [0.05, 0.0, 0.95], ""], [12518, "2016-10-12T17:21:50Z", [0.1, 0.0, 0.9], ""], [10898, "2016-10-12T17:15:26Z", [0.05, 0.0, 0.95], ""], [23206, "2016-10-12T15:48:34Z", [0.02, 0.0, 0.98], ""], [23262, "2016-10-12T15:38:32Z", [0.01, 0.0, 0.99], "Because Utah.

After a long, and very unusual election season, we stand with Trump trying to recover from a very well publicized scandal, and GOP leadership, who after never looking like they had much support for him in the first place, now actively throwing him under the bus. First for how the comments themselves will affect him. I believe that most people are not going to change their vote based on them, but you don't need most people to make a difference in an election, and assuming the Brexit effect is in play pushing his actual numbers ahead of the polls, it still probably would've been close without this scandal, which means hardly any voters would need to be swayed to turn that into a loss. As things stand now, I predict its over for him. But this is hardly a normal election cycle. On the other side we have Clinton, dragging scandal after scandal behind her. Avoiding indictment only after the FBI director repeatedly called her incompetent. The fallout of a bitter primary season, with the opposing side feeling like they were cheated. And of course wikileaks. So far this year she's suffered the DNC leaks, the Guccifer 2.0 leaks, dropping plenty for people to get angry about, but no true bombshells and otherwise minimal mainstream media coverage compared to whenever Trump opens his mouth. But with just a month left to go, Assange seems to have placed all his chips down, and declared that these final leaks will end Hillary. To me, if anything might be able to sway this election, it will be this. But lets break down the main possibilities. 1, Assange is blowing hot air. The leaks have nothing. Just a rude or ambiguous statement here and there. 2, The leaks bring more scandals, but no true bombshells. 3, A serious bombshell that the press cannot ignore, that puts her on the defensive. 4, The atomic warhead of bombshells. Obama himself can no longer justify letting her walk free. For the first, leaks have already begun coming out, and have already given us some scandals, and potential scandals if picked up by the press. We're past this stage so it isn't gonna happen. For the second, if the dirt remains par for whats already come out. Collusion to keep Sanders from winning. Shady dealing with donors. Her saying insulting things. More evidence that she ordered her emails deleted and wanted no one to know what was on them. Collusion with journalists to get favorable coverage. Details about her health, etc. In a normal campaign this would be crippling, but I predict that the media will still downplay it in favor of more coverage on Trumps bus comments, or the last five things he said. Leaks of this level will hardly help Trump, even if he rubs them in her face on the third debate. For this case, Hillary still wins. 0% Trump victory. For the third, this would have to be something that would cause serious uproar. Evidence of election fraud, an email with her flat out saying she sold weapons to ISIS and wishes she could sell them more. Proof she helped donors walk away with millions at the expense of the poor. A cartoon villain style confession. These would be leaks that get very close to Assange's bluster. This would be a major blow to her campaign, and at best, put her back to pre bus-gate levels against Trump. Exactly what is found could strongly sway the actual percentages, but I'll say it averages out at a modest advantage for Trump in a fair election. Lets put that at 70% Trump victory. For the fourth, this is effectively what Assange is promising. An email of her ordering someone killed dated just before that person died. Treason against Obama, covering up a rape by Bill, ordering voting machines to be rigged to steal primaries from Sanders. Planned or ordered violent crime, breaking and entering. Something that will end her. Not only would she loose, people will be demanding her in prison. 100% Trump victory Exactly what chances I give each of these is tricky. Assange has been tooting his horn about Hillary all year without much to show as of yet. However, his latest claims go well beyond and should not be completely written off. Since 4 seems to be what he's promising, I'll give it at least 20%. However, all of this being hot air can't be ignored either, so I'll assign another 20% to #2. This would leave 60% left for #3. Assuming a fair election, that's .2*0+.6*.7+.2=.62 so a 62% chance of a Trump victory. To be honest this feels rather high, but these numbers are just a first draft and I'll hopefully remember to revisit them later. But the keyword here is fair. What if theirs cheating? Given the nature of this, we don't really have numbers for how often election fraud occurs, let alone to what extent and let alone at the presidential level. But we have easily hacked voting machines, an electoral college that allows the results of a single state to swing the entire election. And of course, no shortage of accusations. Who seems to be the most likely to resort to cheating to win? Wrong question. Better to ask who is more likely to get away with it. Trump has partly leadership hostile towards him, and a media watching his every move. He wouldn't be able to cheat even if he wanted to. Hillary on the other hand has an extensive powerbase, and an opposing party that might want to push it in her favor too. A completely honest Hillary would need not have a clue if those in her Democrat power base decide to do it for her. Thus, the possibility of cheating would only skew the odds in her favor. However, this would only matter in #3, as in #2 it would make no difference, and #4 its too late. In addition, just because someone tries to cheat, doesn't mean they cheated hard enough, with it being a balancing act between making a difference and not getting caught. Further, cheat in an election that already goes in your favor and you changed nothing. Some rough estimates, I gave #3 70% Trump which are the only cases where it would matter, of that say 60% is close enough to change, lets give it a low %20 chance of attempted cheating. That's 8.4% of cheating changing a #3 towards Hillary, giving new odds of .2*0+.6*.7*(.4+.6*.8)+.2=.57 or 57% Trump victory if we consider the possibility of cheating, unless we find evidence of attempted election fraud against Sanders. With the seriousness of the leaks being the biggest drivers, I'll need to pay close attention to whats being released and adjust based on how likely each possibility seems to be by the end. Its not unlikely Assange would save the worst for later, possibly 2 weeks before the election. As it gets later then that, the odds of something more serious then what we already see goes down. By 1 week, I doubt we'd see anything worse unless we're already at a very strong #3. I'll also consider adjustments to the other percentages, most likely reducing the chance of a Trump victory given #3\n"], [10267, "2016-10-12T04:50:20Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [51, "2016-10-12T02:45:04Z", [0.1, 0.0, 0.9], ""], [484, "2016-10-12T02:20:33Z", [0.1, 0.0, 0.9], "R down 5%.

It was a bit too sophisticated of an argument for the typical American to take in, much of which was delivered by implication; so I don't expect many Americans to clearly see how it was such a gigantic departure from the unpopulist mainstream narrative. That is, there was a level of nuanced detail that made this an original argument for prime time consumption.

Unfortunately, he does not take the time to educate the typical American, ignorant of why such details matter, on their significance to the debate.

Here is why. COMMENT:  The influence of WOMEN in politics came into play with DT's  self inflicted BLACK SWAN (NB: Tape (s? >) simply a BG1 view) event essentially providing compelling evidence that on his present path he will fail to  become POTUS on the 8/11/16 vote. His litany of racist & misogynic campaign remarks about Women, Latinos, Blacks ( for that matter Asian & Muslim) reached a new low in an eleven (11) year old tape establishing, once again, DT's fundamental flaw that a Women is to be treated  as a CHATTLE not, a Partner for life. This \"UNEXPECTED\" disclosure simply reinforces an INHERENT CHARACTER instability  on the one hand and, has set in motion a series of critical political chain of events on the other hand: \na) debate posturing leaves him on the defensive & in a poor position; although the basis of the party remains supportive,  DT has marginal top GOP support at an important moment (FN5);\nb) his conduct, when viewed over an extended period of time, has turned a reasonably close race to an increasingly clear path for HRC (FN1);\nc) the side effects of which have created increased uncertainty to a \"seemingly\" clear House GOP Majority position to be questioned (FN4);\nd) and,  reduced a good opportunity  for GOP to maintain Senate Control;  each of which, standing alone, make clear DT's low forecast probability is indeed JUSTIFIED.  His path to the Presidency, for example,  has caused such a degree of disequilibrium  both w/in the GOP &  beyond, that many underlying variables at the Presidential, Senate, House & State levels remain extremely difficult reduce or worse, remain in a constant state of change. Thus,  when considered as a SUM OF THE PARTS analysis, the events  not only  force serious reconsideration at the POTUS level,  but also consideration of close calls on the Senate vote &, whether the GOP continues to control the House of Representatives on the one hand.   Moreover, DRILLING  down further into the critical State election levels, DT's single handed self demolition forces a reconsideration of which States will fall towards HRC.  PENNSYLVANIA, N.C., FLORIDA, OHIO, VIRGINIA er cetera. Take your pick.  CONCLUSION: Balancing the differential of being too quick to alter a judgement,  vs. being too slow to do so, has been v difficult.   A daunting but, exhilarating task. Facts have changed nearly weekly.  The discounting mechanism can be seen working immediately through polling results (FN1), which taken alone, must be taken w/ a JAR of salt.  That said, **more critically**, the combined influence of facts & circumstances on The Margin of Error (FN2) being greater than predicted, along with additional circumstantial  evidence that is clearly influential to UNDECIDED VOTERS (as HIGH as 8/14% by some estimates) is an important variable on tipping a certain percentage AWAY from DT (FN3).  In sum, they amount to an insurmountable obstacle for Mr. Donald Trump to gain the Presidency.  Considering the evidence, the TRENDLINE is v clear. DT is entitled to a 5% probability on the facts and circumstances as they are today.  There is still nearly thirty (30) day time line on resolution of this Q. A political lifetime? Yes. There is a v high probability circumstances will continue to change. Another WikiLeaks data dump that dogs HRC all the way to 8/11/16? Another DT tape?

Trump will do better in each successive debate and the only narrative worth reporting will be of him gradually eclipsing her. Clinton can't do any better than she has already done, and there's still a real risk of her suffering some major health problem that would wholly disqualifiy her in the minds of most voters. Finally, where are his media spots? Is Trump really so averse to having his face on TV that he's willing to sacrifice the few percentage points that TV ads would buy him? It seems more likely that he's waiting for a media blitz closer to the actual vote, rather than diluting his message over a span of months.

The interesting thing about New Hampshire is that Trump's loss seems to have parked itself in Johnson's column, and a slight loss by Clinton may have been picked up by Stein. Clinton had pretty solid leads in Virginia all along, so her reclaiming it is no surprise, and in my opinion it was unlikely that Trump had any real shot there anyway. Aside from those two states moving to the Clinton side, the RCP Toss-up column is still quite large at this stage. Here's a link to the map: http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/2016_elections_electoral_college_map.html So it's a question of whether enough Toss-ups move back to the Clinton side of the map, where they were throughout of August. Clinton has shown that she can (prospectively) put together enough states to win, but crucially, she can only do that when Trump is at his most idiotic. Polls moved convincingly toward Clinton after Trump insulted Captain Khan's parents, and then just wouldn't let the matter drop.

A. HYPOTHESIS: \nU.S. voters  who trouble themselves to go to the polls shortly, DESERVE a Champion.  They have been left a choice of  Hillary Rodham Clinton (HRC), Donald Trump (DT) or another Third Party candidate. Voting HRC into Office, sets  precedent on the one hand &, flies in the face of US historical politics on the other hand (1). Such an outcome is nothing short of reaffirming the Elite  Political STATUS QUO positioning for the next four years (2), while  setting the torch to reignite the cycle of distrust that has been the landmark issue of this election phase (3). A DT Presidency on the other hand WILL be both a historic & unprecedented in any event. B. FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION/OUTSIDE VIEW:  Is a favorable outcome for HRC tantamount to a REJECTION of the political DISEQUILIBRIUM that exists across the Western Hemisphere?  C. Evidence SUPPORTING ongoing disequilibrium beyond U.S. borders is COMPELLING: BREXIT (4), the recent Jeremy Corbyn landslide  Labor victory in the UK (5) along with hot button immigration issues that have generated significant political party shifts in the EU (6) felt as far away as Australia (7).  FAST FORWARD as further direct evidence of this ongoing disequilibrium  in U.S. : enter Donald Trump & Bernie Sanders eighteen (18) months prior hereto. Both were not taken seriously w/ DT one step away from becoming POTUS.  D. Evidence SUPPORTING reaffirmation of Status Quo \"known factor\": PredictWise 75/25%( betting market), PollyVote 53/47 ( forecast accumulator model), Upshot 74/26 ( NYT) with under forty (40) days to go, ALL give  HRC what is a high  probability factor that HRC nonetheless is victorious in any event by a slight margin. She retains an undisputed edge of 3/4% as of 4/10/16 over DT. (8)  Anyway one looks at it today, the COMBINED  sources predict an IDENTICAL outcome.  BALANCED against this however is a look back towards BREXIT BetFair Market (betting market forecasts) had REMAIN ahead 51% just a few hours before the eventual outcome. (9)  CONCLUSION:\nCAVET EMPTOR: UNCERTAINTY GUARANTEED Time is of the essence.  Uncertainties remain substantial.  On the one hand, the facts clearly indicate so called Polling Specialists, Sophisticated High Street Media Editorials, &, so called Top Political Forecasters prediction models that LABELED BREXIT supporters & Labor Leader Corbyn in the UK, for example,  as  UNDERDOGS, incompetents, racist, &/or, generally unfit to lead a particular party, failed to make the correct forecast! These various accusations & facts, also applies to the entire DT electoral process from pre-nomination to the present day. An example of political antifragility as defined by Nassem Taleb?  Today, EXPERTS are all polling HRC as a slight favorite. On the other hand, *** critically important***,  forecasting models have failed to accurately assess the THIRD PARTY/UNDECIDED component, which by certain projections remain as high as 10-15% of the U.S. vote. (10).  For example, should White Anglo Saxon Protestants ( WASP)  voters, without a college degree turnout & vote for DT, by 10% over their previous involvement in the last Presidential election, this element can tip the scale. (11)! There are no SILVER BULLETS on this forecast. Much to the contrary, the above-mentioned forecast has raised significantly more questions than, straight forward answers. http://journal.sjdm.org/16/16511/jdm16511.pdf (12)  From my side, it has been incremental but nonetheless daunting process to participate in this U.S. question.

Social media intelligence allows one to collect intelligence gathering from social media sites, using both intrusive or non-intrusive means, from open and closed social networks. The term was coined in a 2012 paper written by Sir David Omand, Jamie Bartlett and Carl Miller for the Centre for the Analysis of Social Media, at the London-based think tank, Demos. The authors argued that social media is now an important part of intelligence and security work, but that technological, analytical and regulatory changes are needed before it can be considered a powerful new form of intelligence, including amendments to the United Kingdom Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000.\nSource: Wikipedia\nWired (UK), June 26, 2013, \u2018Meet Prism's little brother: Socmint\u2019: http://www.wired.co.uk/article/socmint\nClip from Wired article:\n\u201cThe intelligence gathering technique -- sometimes known as Social Media Intelligence or Socmint -- has been used in conjunction with an alarming array of sophisticated analytical tools. \"Sentiment analysis\" that can determine your mood; \"horizon scanning\" that tries to pre-empt disorder and crime; facial recognition software that can track down individuals; geo-location that is able to pinpoint your whereabouts, and profiling that can map who you are and what circles you move in.

Once the moderator asked a question which had implications which might impugn his personality, however, and further lured from that point forward by Clinton with personal jabs, Trump reverted to his same old name-calling and buffoonery. He is, after all, or so he at least claims, a counter-puncher. His counter-punching did not serve him well. He had the initiative and he lost it.\n\u2022 Trump hammered on specific job and economic examples (e.g. an unfair tax differential between Mexico and the U.S., which actually impedes fair trade, to the detriment of the United States), Clinton responded with generalities and platitudes, and invoked the old \"independent experts\" mantra. I was so waiting for the famous Michael Gove comeback (\"I think people in this country have had enough of experts\"), but it was not to be. Trump missed his chance to obtain an early knockout blow on economic policy. Clinton was on the ropes, she was going to stand behind NAFTA, and he let her off the hook. NAFTA supporters consider free trade a system to be maximized. If you're a proper leader, you'd think of NAFTA as a mechanism by which the system of free trade could be optimized for the benefit of your country. In the latter case, NAFTA has failed miserably.\n\u2022 Trump, when pressed by Clinton on his business management practices, more-or-less 'fessed up to screwing over the suppliers, vendors, and contractors that he uses. Trump implied it was all OK, because he only \"took advantage of the laws of the nation.\" The \"rule of law\" is not justice, and screwing over contractors is inflicting harm. Laborers and sole proprietor contractors don't have the wherewithal to challenge the likes of Trump in court for a ten thousand dollar contract dispute. So Trump screws over a hundred contractors for ten thousand dollars each, and it adds up. When injustice is done, and the system allows those who have perpetrated the injustice to get away with it (impunity), resentment against not only the wrongdoer, but the society at large ensues. We all pay the price for such improper behavior. First, we finance the legal system that enables such practices; and secondly, such practices sap the spirit of goodwill, efficiency, and fair dealing that are necessary for a coherent society, thus feeding the false narrative of zero-sum transactional economics. It's a crappy business practice (it's plain theft buttressed with intimidation under color of law); but hey, that's Trump.\n\u2022 In response to a question on race relations and \"bridging the racial divide\" (which, of course, presupposes that such a divide in fact exists), neither candidate addressed the question, and both quickly answered with criminal justice and enforcement plans (\"law and order\"). My goodness. Doesn't that just speak tons about how those candidates truly feel about race relations! The fact is, race relations are generally good, the minority communities are suffering the effect of the economic depression more so than the population as a whole, and the issue is therefore an economic issue. Crime is a separate issue.\n\u2022 Both candidates plan to spit on the Second Amendment by disallowing citizens that are on the so-called \"terrorist watchlist\" from obtaining weapons. This, of course, is hogwash, for not only does it fly in the face of the language of the Second Amendment itself (\"the right ... shall not be infringed\"), but the very purpose of the Second Amendment was to protect the citizenry from a government that runs amok. You can't very well then give to the government the right to create a secret watchlist (or any list for that matter) that prevents that right from being exercised! But this whole debate was a tour de force in muddled thinking.\n\u2022 Trump is all good with the idea that the priority mission of NATO should be re-purposed so as to combat terrorism. In fact, Trump would like to claim this new direction for NATO to be a result of his idea and prompting. This is not good news for those that believe the entire terrorist phenomenon is an intentionally constructed narrative to distract and deceive. Once Trump connects his self-esteem with an issue, rationality goes out the window.\n\u2022 Trump continued to seek to differentiate himself as not being a \"professional politician,\" and repeatedly associated Clinton with a class of \"political hacks\" that have made poor economic and foreign policy decisions. Clinton invoked her panic button-like catch all \"fact checker\" squad. When confronted with the notion that her \"experience,\" claimed to be related to poor policy decisions, was not something to be touted, Clinton sheepishly chose not to argue the case. It was a perfect opportunity for her to dive in to her accomplishments, but her silence surrendered the point.\n\u2022 I imagine each candidate gets to select some number of audience attendees. Trump keeps rolling out Don King, the boxing promoter. Professional boxing in the United States, since at least the 1920s, has been routinely fixed. I think the selection of King by Trump speaks volumes as to what Trump values.\n\u2022 Perhaps it was the stress of Clinton trying to land a last minute blow when the clock was ticking down, but the accusation that Trump believes \"women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as a man\" somehow left me with, \"Well, yeah. So?\" I guess the accusation might be that Trump thinks that it is conceivable that women in general are not capable of performing as well as men, but this is not what he said; and the real principle must be that the pay is based on the job, whatever that is, irrespective of the sex (or whatever other characteristic) of the worker. So I think Trump was trying to articulate the principle, and the over-reaching by Clinton came across as reaching for straws.\n\u2022 Trump cited a Clinton reference as springing from \"the mainstream media.\" Just as Trump has done with free trade, for a major party presidential candidate to even utter those words in a nationally televised debate, in the totally controlled propaganda environment that is the United States, opens up the minds of millions of citizens, and gives them permission to even contemplate the notion of a national media dominated by \"political hacks.\" \n\u2022 The prognostication by Trump during the primaries that he would \"crush\" Clinton in a one-on-one debate proved false.

Obama took Rhode Island by 27 points and all the pre-election polls showed with a double-digit lead.

Research has revealed a very mixed-up history of email and other communications by government employees. For instance, there is the so-called Hatch Act which restricts the use of governmental systems for political activity. This act, in effect, forces governmental employees with political activities to maintain two separate communication systems. There is also, apparently, a not-so-pretty history of email and other communication systems being set-up to accommodate adherence to this act, and for other purposes, that gets very grisly and extends well back into the Bush-era. Whether the vulnerabilities introduced by the Hatch Act were planned, or only arose as recognized opportunities of exploitation, I do not know. What's obvious, however, is that the entire issue of personal, political. governmental business (including secret) electronic communications by high-level governmental employees (overlapping into the private sector) has a real history that's not generally understood. In such an environment the claim that Clinton mishandled classified information would be an easy claim to make. At that level, with such a mixed-up system environment, the same claim could be made against a host of other government employees; including, as I've said, those extending into the Bush-era. The history would not (fully) exculpate Clinton, but it would cast light somewhat on the greater context in which her activities took place. It's a little surprising that no Democratic loyalists have gone into this dark past of political communication, at least in some attempt to take the heat off Clinton. It makes me think that, like Watergate, there's some evil infestation of both parties lurking in the background.]\nhttp://www.dla.mil/AboutDLA/News/NewsArticleView/Article/902150/hatch-act-outlines-restrictions-on-political-activity-by-federal-employees/\nhttps://books.google.com/books?id=iZ9Y3SFY_lgC&pg=PA75&lpg=PA75&dq=jeff+averbeck+smarttech&source=bl&ots=79IANGWWJj&sig=o2I7PedX2rM09k_G30SMu9J4gYs&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi5_LDSnoDPAhVDDMAKHfweB8Q4ChDoAQgwMAQ#v=onepage&q=jeff%20averbeck%20smarttech&f=false"], [10267, "2016-09-08T03:29:34Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [1056, "2016-09-08T03:07:34Z", [0.7, 0.0, 0.3], "This link is from a Republican web site, so the slant of the article is decidedly anti-Clinton.

Clinton was never more than a governmental employee, and all work-product she created in the course of that employment belongs to the government. The government cannot be placed in a disadvantageous position because an employee intentionally created an environment where the two (claimed) forms of communication have been co-mingled. The burden for the creation of such an environment should fall upon the employee that created it, not the government. In short, Clinton abandoned all rights to pricacy when she co-mingled the communications. \"Who owns the data?\" will be a question that will be quite popular in a variety of environments in the future. The Clinton episode is just the first to (hopefully) clarify it in the public mind. [The vaccine-autism epidemic is another episode that could further clarify the question, but the autism epidemic has been wholly buried by the unpopulist media.] The unpopulist media is questioning the efficacy of the narrative which they themselves have created.

The ultimate answer to \"Who owns the data?\" is: the party that bears the risk of harm should the data be wrong. It's a bit more complicated, but that's it. Update: Powell told Clinton the straight scoop. He ran the risk and got away with it. She got caught, but wants to say \"he told me to do it.\"\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/09/07/former-secretary-of-state-colin-powell-told-hillary-clinton-he-used-personal-computer-for-business/?utm_term=.869f7398b08c \"If ... you are using it [a personal device], government or not, to do [government] business, it may become an official record and subject to the law,\" Powell is exactly correct. One instance of co-mingling and all the data on whatever device becomes the property of the government. The presumption is that it belongs to the government, and not that it is private. Any good enforcement agency would have seized every server and device immediately, long ago. But Clinton didn't just run-the-risk that Powell described. Oh no, she upped the ante! She took ALL of her correspondence into a non-governmental-system computer, not just some (as had Powell). So yes, Powell should be subject to some discipline as well. But his forthright email to Clinton was more of a \"notice\" of the parameters of accountability as it was anything else. She knew the parameters, decided to run-the-risk, and got caught. Sounds like intention to me. One thing about Powell though. I don't think he'll sell out his credibility, unlike Comey and Lynch.

Many community leaders are stepping back from full-throated endorsements of Clinton (\"make up your own mind\"), while others are even going so far as to support the ABC movement (\"make up your own mind, so long as it's Anybody But Clinton\"). The only voice I have seen that is solidly and consistently behind Clinton is Black Lives Matter, and this group I would classify as an extreme radical (on the verge of violence) far-left element.* All other voices, including both mainstream and strongly activist (albeit non-violent) voices in this community seem to be genuinely undecided (or perhaps better stated, not so strongly committed). In this respect the black community mirrors the nation as a whole.

This, to me, is another sign of centralized coordination; in particular because these chants are not traditional protest songs, but somewhat unique to this group alone. These are new, provocative chants promoting aggressive action. This is far more than an airing of grievances.

Update: Former U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens challenges the explicit quid pro quo corruption standard.\nhttp://dailycaller.com/2016/08/26/old-justice-stevens-dissent-shreds-the-central-argument-of-clintons-corruption-defense/ \"the difference between selling a vote and selling access is a matter of degree, not kind.\" This is an excellent example of how \"rule of law\" falters when it runs up against the better judgement of public nuance and morality. Now, admittedly, corruption can be a complex and messy affair. But for those voters who both somehow still believe that the conduct of Clinton is not illegal under the current regime, and are sufficiently engaged to seek to understand some of the arguments, this opinion by ex-Justice Stevens may embolden them in their thinking that the behavior of Clinton is in any case morally wrong, and would be illegal under a different, better legal regime; and will vote according to the moral precept rather than the legal precept. Intent, and the so-called state of mind of a perpetrator, is a factual question that is in the purview of the jury. The law has set a standard for the jury to use which runs contrary to the way people make moral judgements about the corrupt behavior of others (once the related pattern is understood). Jurors can make decisions as to matters of degree, they do not need an artificial standard based on an irrelevant and forced difference in kind decision rule. The judicial system designs itself for expediency, not justice. Be wary of all systems which tout the \"rule of law\" as a defining factor.

And there may be enough, demographers and pollsters said. But for now it appears that after a ceaseless stream of provocations, insults and reckless remarks, Mr. Trump has damaged himself significantly with the one demographic that stands as a bulwark to a Clinton presidency.\n. . . \n\u201cIf you set out to design a strategy to produce the lowest popular vote possible in the new American electorate of 2016, you would be hard-pressed to do a better job than Donald Trump has,\u201d said Whit Ayres, a pollster who has advised Republican presidential and Senate candidates for more than 25 years. \u201cThis is an electoral disaster waiting to happen.\u201d\n. . . \n\"Two national polls conducted this month have Mrs. Clinton catching up to Mr. Trump among men over all. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll shows Mrs. Clinton with 43 percent support among men to his 42 percent. A Bloomberg Politics survey put Mr. Trump with a low-single-digit lead among men, according to the pollster who conducted the survey, Ann Selzer. \" . . .  Mr. Trump is . . .  more reliant on them [white men] because of how poorly he performs with nonwhite voters. If Mr. Trump is only doing as well or worse than Mr. Romney did with white men, he will never make up the votes he is losing among women and nonwhites. \". . . The data reveal a huge gap in those who have a college education and those who do not. As Mr. Trump saw in the Republican primaries, he is most vulnerable with white men who have a college education or higher. Mr. Romney won that group, which votes at a higher rate than those without college degrees, by 21 points. Recent national polls have put Mr. Trump\u2019s support with them far lower. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at a margin among college-educated white men for him that\u2019s less than half what Romney won,\u201d said Gary Langer, an independent pollster who conducted an ABC News/Washington Post survey this month that showed Mr. Trump losing over all to Mrs. Clinton. \u201cAnd that is problematic for Trump given his need to appeal to whites.\u201d\n. . . \n\" Two national polls have recently put his support from African-Americans at an astonishing 1 percent. Separate Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist surveys in Ohio and Pennsylvania from July found that zero percent of black voters said they planned to vote for him. The latest poll of Latinos, conducted within the last week by Fox News, had Mr. Trump with just 20 percent support, below the 27 percent that Mr. Romney received in 2012.\n. . . \n\"William H. Frey, a demographics expert with the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan think tank, conducted several simulations that tried to determine how much the turnout among white men without college educations would have to increase for Mr. Trump to win. He used the most recent ABC News/Washington Post poll of registered voters that had Mrs. Clinton beating Mr. Trump in a nationwide two-way race, 50 percent to 42 percent. It was among the better polls for Mr. Trump lately. Mr. Frey tested different turnout assumptions, including improbably optimistic ones, like if 99 percent of white, non-college-educated men turned out to vote. None of the chain of events produced a Trump victory. In fact, even if virtually all of the white, non-college-educated men eligible to vote did so, Mr. Frey found, Mrs. Clinton would still win the popular vote by 1.1 million.\n. . . \n\"By not appealing more broadly to African-Americans, Hispanics and other minority groups, Mr. Trump is precariously reliant on a segment of the population that is a shrinking portion of the electorate. White voters were 88 percent of the electorate in the 1980 election, a figure that has declined a few percentage points every four years since then. By 2012, the white vote was down to 72 percent.

This perception of Trump was reinforced by his espousing some domestic policies that were radically divergent from those of the leadership of both parties. Here, however, with this foreign policy speech, Trump joins the rabid war-mongering crowd. \"we should have kept the oil in Iraq\" \"We will defeat Radical Islamic Terrorism\" \"All actions should be oriented around this goal, and any country which shares this goal will be our ally.\"\n\u2022 It is to become the number one \"mission\" of the United States to do so. \"We cannot always choose our friends, but we can never fail to recognize our enemies.\"\n\u2022 This is but a convoluted restatement of the Bush \"If you're not with us ....\" doctrine.

We will decimate Al Qaeda, and we will seek to starve funding for Iran-backed Hamas and Hezbollah.\"\n\u2022 The U.S. will define \"Radical Islamic Terrorism\" as it sees fit, and it's going to be an expanding definition.

The facts as disclosed today, leave less room for doubt, under the present trajectory, HRC will become POTUS unless either, her \"alleged\" health issues take gain ground or, the present investigations by the FBI & U.S. Attorney's office break landmark ground during this Presidential election period. Thus, as the facts and circumstances have changed over the last five months, so too has my initial forecast. A. Just a few of the more obvious recent examples of why I am forced to discard by original thesis: 1. Is DT either directly or indirectly making a concerted effort to \"throw away\" his election chances? http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/presidential-campaign/291286-is-trump-deliberately-throwing-the-election-to ; \n2. In a MUST read piece, Thomas L. Friedman @ NYT raises a critical and telling question on DT's recent Second Amendment controversy. True to form, Friedman leaves little doubt on the issue. http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/10/opinion/trumps-ambiguous-wink-wink-to-second-amendment-people.html?smid=nytcore-iphone-share&smprod=nytcore-iphone .

Or, looked at through another perspective, DT over this period of time has created so much uncertainty about his public persona that it is now nearly impossible to eliminate. Voters have been left with the uncertainties of HRC balanced against the impossibility of forecasting what is next in DT\"s bag of tricks. True to form for this election process, there is always the 60/40% probability btw now &, November another completely unexpected event... can yet alter the present situation. An unenviable selection.

Bernie Sanders won the California Democratic primary, but election fraud robbed him of a victory.\"\nhttp://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2016/aug/03/judge-rules-in-election-case-bernie-sanders/ The opinion of this judge in this case reminds me of how auditors handle \"material weakness\" in a client. A material weakness is where there is a good chance that something significant may not be known about a company, and yet it does not prevent an auditor from certifying the books. I've never understood this approach. It's like saying \"The 90% of the transactions we can evaluate are fine, but there are 10% that we have no idea about, and while it is true that those 10% may offset all of the gains or losses in the 90%, we're still fine with saying everything is OK.\" How can this be? They simply do not know. It's as if admitting that one does not know, by itself, somehow adds extra-special-certainty back upon something that one already knew, and this magically transforms what is not known into something that is no longer relevant. The logic that recognizing a gap in knowledge diminishes the potential defect caused by that gap escapes me. In this instance, fraudulent \"mail-in votes that arrived later and provisional ballots\" could have stolen the election. No one knows, since these were not audited. Again, exactly the way material weaknesses are treated. We've got a problem. no one knows it's impact (although it could have swung the election), but hey, let's move on, we've got other things to do! The more rational option would seem to be to invalidate the entire general claim (i.e., the books are OK, the election was good) and throw it back upon the parties to sort it out, with the risk of such sorting falling upon the parties making the claim, not those parties relying upon the claim that has been made."], [13884, "2016-08-11T01:28:08Z", [0.13, 0.02, 0.85], ""], [689, "2016-08-10T23:11:06Z", [0.5, 0.0, 0.5], ""], [1308, "2016-08-10T20:24:27Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [241, "2016-08-10T20:18:18Z", [0.1, 0.0, 0.9], ""], [10898, "2016-08-10T19:34:46Z", [0.16, 0.0, 0.84], ""], [14208, "2016-08-10T18:36:41Z", [0.49, 0.0, 0.51], "If Donald Trump were a fish he would have been caught and released a dozen times by now by those left leaning Anglers.

[Pardon the vulgarities. I expect these will not be the last of this campaign.] The DT unforced errors, and the imperviousness of some voters to such errors, notwithstanding, here's an interesting statistic that may account for at least some of the changes in recent polling: Television advertising expenditures (week of 07/24 -- 07/30)\nClinton  $6,334,884  (7,320 ads)\nTrump        -- 0 --  (0 ads)\nhttp://host.madison.com/wsj/news/national/govt-and-politics/interactive-ad-spending-by-candidates-for-president/html_bec99b55-77a8-5d92-88d9-fa315d5b5f34.html * It's so bad (or good, depending, I guess) that people are even imagining Trump to have positions that he does not hold. \"He said he likes Trump's views on jobs, trade, education, freedom of speech ...\" As far as I can tell, Trump has never come out with a single word in favor of free speech. On the contrary, he has threatened to reduce/eliminate a related right (freedom of the press) for \"lying reporters,\" and wants to make it easier to sue such reporters \"out of business.\" I may be wrong, but I have not seen a single remark by Trump related to free speech per se. (It may be possible that the speaker views lack of manners and personal name calling as the exact same thing as challenging political correctness, which it is not; or extends his understanding of challenging political correctness to include promotion of free speech.)  So maybe I've overstated the interpretation of this observation, but with this \"wholesale psychological transference\" of \"something\" to Trump, I would not be surprised if we do in fact start hearing of people that believe Trump stands for X, when by proclamation he stands for not-X.

The presenter listed maybe 5-10 legitimate grievances of the colonists that, he maintained, had the British Parliament resolved, would have taken the energy out of the revolution and Britain would have retained her colony. I forget the list, but as I recall, each item was in itself really no big deal. The presenter went on to say that rather than alleviating these grievances, the Parliament \"doubled down\" and made their enforcement that much stricter. In a previous post I pointed out that through recent court cases, and legislative and regulatory initiatives (really, across-the-board), the existing order has done the exact same thing of \"doubling down\" on preventing accountability for corruption.

Although they did not (I don't think) undertake any extension of their analysis, I think it remains an interesting idea how far one might be able to go with such an extension. The basic notion is this: SENSEI created a word cloud that seemingly ranked associated adjectives within each Brexit camp. Visual inspection of the cloud indicated that the leading adjective for the Remain camp was \"Stronger\" whereas the leading adjective for the Leave camp was \"Right.\" My wonder is whether these results can be turned into some sort of predictive measure by blind polling of people upon the sentimental preference between adjectives. That is, how would a random sample of people respond when forced to make a preferential choice based on the words alone? An underlying presumption of such an indirect study would be that one could gain some indication of future conscious choice by gaining insight into current, associated, subliminal disposition (or some psycho-babble like that). Despite having been warned-off such an indirect approach as being a bit too squishy, I'm constantly reminded of it whenever I see the Clinton \"Stronger Together\" theme.

It's rather shocking that Trump allowed himself to be drawn into such a no-win losing battle. Now, since there is *nothing* to be gained by winning a battle against the father of a deceased serviceman, either Trump wants to appeal to bigots, or he really handled this interchange very poorly. The proper response would have been:\n1) Acknowledge the sacrifice of the Khan family\n2) Move immediately to a clarification of his position (de-spinning the DNC spin)\nand 3) leave it up to some campaign spokesperson later to put on the record that Trump loves to read the Constitution.

Trump Accuses Fire Marshal Of Voting Clinton After Restricting Rally Goers\nhttp://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/trump-fire-marshall-clinton-voter-accusation Wow. What kind of \"thought process\" does Trump have? Does he really believe that the Fire Marshall makes a determination of occupancy safety based on \"looking around?\" Now, it is possible that this particular Fire Marshall did not follow the prescribed local code, and, being a Hillary supporter, just made things up as he went along, and at some point decided to allow his bias to come through and intentionally \"underestimated\" (by looking around) the safe occupancy for the room. But, how realistic is that? Trump, as a builder (or so he says), should know better. Maybe, as he has done in the past, Trump makes a joke about his audience exceeding capacity. Fine. But to ridicule and impugn the professional conduct of the Fire Marshall is just too much. Fire Marshalls don't write the code on the spot, they enforce pre-existing codes. And given the prominence of the event, I'd guess that Fire Marshall was well-prepared to obtain the actual count in some better method than just \"looking around.\" THANK GOODNESS WE LIVE IN A WORLD WITH PEOPLE LIKE THAT FIRE MARSHALL!! Imagine a boat made for ten, some big mouthed bully screaming, \"Oh come on, make way for these five pretty young babes. We can make room for them!

It would strip the base support away from both the ultra socially conservative Republicans and the ultra liberal Democratic ideologues. If this coalition catches on, and Trump continues with a rhetoric against which Clinton has no rebuttal, it will be a far closer race than many are predicting. It's a coalition that leaves bare those extreme, \"out-of-touch\" wings from either party which have traditionally played an oversized role in party dynamics.

The fact that Trump is not politically correct, and is likely a racist, a bully, and an overall jerk, doesn't matter. That he's stupid, a snake-oil salesman, a blowhard, a front for organized crime, or whatever, also doesn't seem to matter. Everybody already knows these things. There must be something else that is attractive about Trump to the voters. Could it possibly be a sheer repudiation of the \"mainstream\" policies of both parties? It's possible the mainstream policies of the parties just do not align with the wishes and desires of mainstream America. The political correctness aside, is it the mainstream political parties that are \"off the mark,\" not Trump? It's a precarious situation. Trump, a flawed individual, may be more in tune with the pulse of the society (e.g., jobs, fair trade, limited military adventurism, not allowing political nicety to interfere with substance, etc) than any so-called mainstream candidate. It's not a good combination. For the past twenty years or so it seems that the American populace has continually, in one fashion or another, voted for \"change,\" (e.g., Obama's pledge to repeal the Patriot Act, midterm repudiation of the democrats), anything to get the buggers out, only to be disappointed when the new group picks up exactly where the old group left off. I see Trump's popularity as a continuation of this desire for real substantive change (the undying hope of naive citizens?), now made manifest in a flawed candidate. I do not believe this continuous underlying impulse for change will be held off by appeal to political correctness, or even candidate qualifications or competence. It's an affective action, and it's a dangerous situation. From a cybernetic (system control) perspective, a sitting GOP senator waffling as to supporting the party candidate, and the no-doubt-about-it crazy candidate himself, are strong indications that the system can't handle this perturbation (the underlying drive for democratic [not socialist] change) and is headed toward massive disequilibrium.

Forsyth concluded saying, \"Accepting the tenets of realism is an act of humility --a rare commodity in international affairs but a useful one nonetheless. American policy makers will eventually come to it, even if they do so reluctantly...Realism is in our future.\" I have mentioned this in the past and will again here...Global Trends 2030 makes it clear in several places that there will be no global hegemony in the future. Analysis; American mood is finished with global intervention. Americans forked over trillions of tax dollars to support nations abroad for seemingly failed foreign policy intervention. The candidates that have embraced a non-intervention foreign policy (Sanders) and putting Americans first (Trump) have interestingly done well in the primaries. Candidates that can embrace a degree of Realism and have empathy for the falling living standards of Americans will be the next POTUS. What is more interesting is Global Trends and Forsyth both seem to have forecasted a Trump like candidate but neither forecasted Trump.

Since this forecast group is very well informed of the variations, probabilities &, outcome, I will not go further. THIS WELL INFORMED COMBINED CONSENSUS view, has a substantial weight.

WHAT effects will this have on voters that eventually go to the booth have after waiting for the determination that the \"hurdle\" required for both circumstantial & direct evidence is sufficient to allow the DOJ to indict ? \n2) NB: as a part of answering (1) is the increasing recognition that, Democratic voters are being forced to consider the DISUNITY of the Party best as exemplified by, HRC supporters who would argue there are MINIMAL differences between HRC & Bernie Sanders (BS) but, BS supporters would argue the differences are in fact FUNDAMENTAL in nature? \n3) BALANCED, against this the Democratic voter is faced w/ a COMPLETELY unexpected &, UNIFIED support for the MOST UNEXPECTED of candidates.

Sacred Cow Number Two today is that DT cannot beat Hillary Rodham Clinton in a race for President of the United States. The following two non consensus pieces attached herewith best explain WHY DT has a good probability  ( > 60%)  of becoming the next President of the U.S.  NB: I have tried not to dismiss their views out of hand and, have come to the conclusion they are both well reasoned and, would HIGHLY recommend they be given consideration as well. http://www.thecorsaironline.com/opinion/2016/05/18/trump-going-win-election-strategy-spoilers-memes-oh/#.dpuf http://www.breitbart.com/milo/2016/05/04/meme-magic-donald-trump-internets-revenge-lazy-entitled-elites/\nWhy? \nThere are indeed, many logical reasons for a HRC victory in November. Additionally, from a procedural perspective, a Presidential race \"generally favors\" a Democratic nominee ( all things being equal NB below). Moreover,  HRC is &, has been the presumptive favorite for her Party nomination. That said,  the role of Bernie Sanders has established there is indeed a split within the Democratic Party, as well. Herein lies an important not to underestimate cross over risk for HRC ( see below). \nB. Fast Forward: \n1. Recent polls 1) http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-general-election-trump-vs-clinton\nhttp://m.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections/election_2016/white_house_watch point to increasingly strong circumstantial evidence, when voters cast their own particular judgement, it is not at all clear that HRC will be the next President of the U.S. \nC. Conclusion:\nWhen I began forecasting this Q early February, two books impacted my judgement. Hendrik Smith\"s Who Stole the American Dream &, Nassim Taleb\"s Antifragile.  Both published 2012. It became clear to me that, after a significant HOLLOWING OUT  of the American middle class, voter DISCONTENT would eventually arise and they, deserved a beacon of hope. Sanders vote is nothing more than a vote against HRC as being this beacon of light. \n1. DT is he is exactly where HE forecast he would be. Atop the GOP heap which is today politically speaking - one might argue - a mess. Nevertheless, media  & the punditry has now DOUBLED down on their original errant forecast.  Indeed, CONSENSUS both within the GJ project (65%) &, public media outlets has HRC as a presumptive favorite to become the next President of the U.S.\n2. Whether it be large media outlets in the US such as NYT, WP or, the FT in London or others, their DOGMATIC approach to DT's chances or, for that matter underestimating the voter discontent brought on by Bernie Sanders as well , makes clear their UNWILLINGNESS to alter their narrative in the face of a clear and changing scenario as best exemplified by the facts of the race, as it stands today. In fact, with their doubling down, they are generating only justifications &, press material that simply to support their mistaken bias in the first instance. \n3.  Finally, there is also a significant cross over risk issue to the HRC campaign as well. http://www.mercuryanalytics.com/hillary-clinton-vs-trump-a-tough-battle/\n\"...Almost 20% of likely Democratic voters would today cross parties and vote for Donald Trump, while only 14% of Republicans would cross parties to vote for Hillary Clinton.

So, a third party has no hope of winning. Now, as to Donkeys vs Elephants.  We can be quite certain that for the republicans, Trump will be the nominee.

This makes things simple: It will be a Clinton vs Trump battle. Let's look at the republicans first: Trump keeps befuddling pundits by rising further and further in the polls. Yes, everyone is having a stab at him. Seemingly everyone hates him. And yet, in spite of constant ridicule, cynicism and derision from all sides (from the political system, the media, celebrities, you name it), his popularity only seems to keep growing. For a while, each time he said something even more outrageous, the standard response was: \"You can't say that and stay in the race!\". And each time, the pundits were proved wrong. Yes, Trump gives every impression that he will make a career-ending mistake any second now. But people who have been holding their breath for it have long since suffocated. So, let us for now assume that Trump will not just vanish from the scene as has been endlessly predicted and repredicted. Let us further assume the best case for him: He manages to unify his party and to get the support of those people who are still undecided. If we follow this trend, his popularity will probably grow a bit more before plateauing.\nIn his favor he has the support of a great number of people, as well as his novelty factor and the fact that everyone perceives him to be \"outside the political establishment\". Against him he has his often ludicrous remarks and statements, such as building the wall and having a foreign state pay for it. His opponent is sure to bring this up and run with it as far as possible. Onwards to the democrats:\nHillary Clinton seems very popular and until very recently, her presidency seemed all but certain. Lately, it feels as if the wind in her sails has quieted down a bit.\nAgainst her, she has of course that she is perceived to be the typical, run-of-the-mill backstabbing and bootlicking politician, \"tainted by a thousand shabby deals\". There are a lot of accusations against Hillary Clinton from quite a few different sides, including corruption from foreign states and of course, everyone's favorite darling, the Benghazi affair.\nIn favor of her is that she is a woman and that she would be the first female American president, a fact she is milking like there is no tomorrow. Quite a lot of people will vote her for that single fact alone. She is also very experienced and knows how to play the political game. She can probably mobilize the dems against a fractured GOP. In addition, she has amazing support, especially from the media. Indeed, there are even reports that Twitter has even gone so far to make anti-Hillary hashtags vanish from its platform. Which brings us to the essential question: Who will win? For a question like that, we consult the polls and use this as an anchor. So far, Clinton has always had a comfortable lead over Trump. But it is important to note: This lead has typically been around 10%. That would mean as a baseline, Dem:Rep ~ 60:40. But popular vote means little in the United States, where the electoral system is strange at best and outright crazy at worst. Since this is difficult to foresee without a lot of effort, I am adjusting this baserate downwards, closer to 50:50. Can we attempt a prediction on who will win that goes beyond the current polls? This is where we risk being murky. Taking the points raised above into account, I give a slight lead to Clinton, simply because the game is a lot easier for her than it is for trump. She has support from the establishment and a very devoted following, he only has support from his voters and only enemies everywhere else. She is experienced and has lucrative connections, he probably knows less about the political game.  How much will all this influence the election? Right now, it's impossible to say. You may come up with a thousand more reasons why one candidate or the other is advantaged. This is just what I saw as the most important and the most deciding. But even then, I will not stray far from my initial prediction. PS: Lately, Trump has been gaining ground over Clinton. I will keep monitoring carefully."], [5001, "2016-05-20T17:22:24Z", [0.51, 0.0, 0.49], ""], [1708, "2016-05-20T15:50:51Z", [0.25, 0.0, 0.75], ""], [16646, "2016-05-20T14:20:12Z", [0.35, 0.0, 0.65], ""], [241, "2016-05-20T13:33:56Z", [0.65, 0.0, 0.35], ""], [24159, "2016-05-20T05:51:00Z", [0.16, 0.0, 0.84], ""], [24159, "2016-05-20T05:50:06Z", [0.11, 0.0, 0.89], ""], [11872, "2016-05-20T03:56:09Z", [0.32, 0.0, 0.68], ""], [25242, "2016-05-20T01:06:44Z", [0.55, 0.0, 0.45], ""], [25021, "2016-05-19T22:37:06Z", [0.27, 0.0, 0.73], "Updated - 12% change, which is big, but I'm coming down to where I think consensus will be in a week or so.

I'm also assuming an additional condition in this question - that this means Trump wins an *uncontested* nomination.\nThe base rate problem: of the 34 historical elections between R and D, R's have won 18 to D's 16 - this is the most favorable base rate to D - since it includes the FDR years, etc., but it is unrealistic, as the current balance (southern states being almost exclusively red) happened with Kennedy and beyond. Still, that gives a 53% chance of a Republican victory. I next looked at the electoral votes (as was recommended), but since this is heavily influenced by the great migration after the 1960's of the \"Dixiecrats\" to the Repubs, I think it's only wise to go back to Kennedy. Of the total electoral votes cast since 1960, Rs have won approximately 54%, so that is another marker. Finally, I measured each state's individual electoral contributions to R and D votes respectively since 1960, and gave each state a P(R). An exhaustive random model of all states (r with their probabilities for R or D resulted in a surprising 64.7% advantage to Republicans. Averaging the three (just for argument's sake), I came out with a 57% likelihood of  a republican victory. (Trump doesn't enter into this, except to assume he is the *uncontested* winner) I did consider the head-to-head polls, but when I examined the Gallup poll results for president since 1960, I discovered that the poll results for the April/May timeframe for each election were no more accurate than a coin toss, and in the past 12 years, they've been wrong 66% of the time.

The long answer is worth reading, but Wang surely does a better job of explaining it[1] than I would, so I suggest taking him for a spin, if you're into these things.  I think that Wong's input is useful, but only one of many sources from which to draw. Foxiness militates against using only a single model or theory to try to predict very messy events like a presidential election. (Or is relying of foxiness itself also \"one big thing\"? Never mind.)

HRC on the other hand opposes the coal industry and is promising to end the coal industry in the US.  See the youtube videos of both candidates describing their positions on coal.  I figured I'd watch KOL the symbol for the exchange traded fund for coal as well as these coal mining stocks SXC, CLD, CNX, ARLP and CNXC.  Below I have have a link for my stockcharts.com monthly KOL chart.  You will notice approximately the same time Trump stated his position on coal the industry stock prices have rallied significantly.  Maybe this is just a coincidence?  But if there is a correlation and Trump wins the smart money will invest heavily in the coal industry and we will see it in KOL and others.  I will go a step further and say I expect KOL to pull back over the next few months then rally to new highs up to $15 area.  If this happens I suspect Trump will be the next POTUS.

It conveniently ignores the immense contribution of our allies to NATO's worldwide interests and its,  necessity  as common defense against  Russia and numerous transnational threats  such as terrorism, cyber-security, and immigration. For example France under both Sarkoky and his socialist sucessor Hollande, aided by a brilliant Fabius, in Chad, Burkina Faso, Cote D'Ivoire etc. This is but one example of where our allies have boots on the ground in support of core  American interests.  \n2.) Clinton is a hawk. Trump's speech may sound like a return to \"realism\" and a multi-polar world but why have such  a large military if no interventions are forseeable.

In that case, I believe DT will not have near the support he is showing at the moment.

Why?\n1. The GOP is arguably in complete disarray. Even if he remains a GOP member ( requires an independent probability estimation on its own)  through the remainder of the process, no one disputes that if he gains the GOP nomination, DT is  and will be an underdog. A long shot. Not a realistic probability. Public polls show HC w/ a still comfortable lead over DT in such a runoff &, a commanding lead over BS in Democratic primary. The automatic response therefore under these conditions is the D party wins, without hesitation. http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html ; NB: GJ team projections show an EVEN greater  probability of an Democratic victory for the \" conditional\" if DT wins GOP, which party wins\" US Presidential election. Ditto the straight out \"who will win US presidential election\" question. The significant consensus number favoring D's vs R's EVEN appears to be rising. \n2.  The clear systematic biases that led media & pundits so way off base continues. One might argue they are even now \"doubling down\". The so-called specialists in these areas that missed the boat in the first instance and, now appear to be saying they do not doubt their original just plain wrong judgement.  NB: http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/03/18/opinion/no-not-trump-not-ever.html?smid=tw-nytdavidbrooks&smtyp=cur&referer=https://t.co/PqC4heOiom\n3. Under normal circumstances, an underdog ( as the case is here in DT) should invigorate, motivate, be of great interest to his own Party. Yet, he is viewed in the above mentioned circles as repulsive by some http://time.com/4264864/romney-backs-cruz-in-effort-to-block-trump/?xid=emailshare  and, has even been on the receiving end of \"Donald Drumpf = Hitler condemnations. Hmmmmm.\n4. Balanced against the above-mentioned,  Cass Sunstein wrote an interesting BB piece recently that essentially said \"when people's convictions are firm, attempts to correct those views, with evidence, can make them firmer still\"! http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2016-03-10/a-better-way-to-dissuade-trump-supporters\n5. NB: two interesting pieces: how HC can lose to DT from Musa Al Gharbi:http://www.counterpunch.org/2016/03/18/hillary-clinton-will-lose-to-donald-trump/ and, Professor Helmut Norpath @ Stomeybrook who makes the case his statistical model has over a 90% chance of winning the presidency. http://fortune.com/2016/02/26/stony-brook-professor-trump/ 6.  Recent tweets one:  @realDonaldTrump \"w/ millions of negative & phony ads against me by the establishment, my numbers continue to go up. Can anyone explain this?\". And, a second: on 18/3/16 Nassim Taleb @nntaleb described the DT/GOP conundrum as follows \" in one word, antifragility.\"  Perhaps, Taleb is now suiting up for a new job nomination in the unlikely event of GOP/DT unexpected victory in the fall: Treasury Secretary ! Not a prediction. A joke. But still. \n6. Concluding: at this stage, both the public &, those participating in this GJ Q have made a clear bet. It is still SOP for all political specialists continue making their case DT is unfit for office.  There  continues to be a strong disbelief at both the GOP & DT levels that is Democrats & HC are a ONE WAY bet.\n7.

From my perspective, a key to unlocking the answer to this Q is : will the numerically speaking \"majority of those frustrated, disenfranchised, voters w/in the GOP in practice\" be able to carry their disappointment into the voting booths in November for DT? Can this under current of dissatisfaction become sufficiently robust to pull off the now v/ unexpected possibility? Probabilities seem to be growing by the day.  Also, not to under-estimate is the presently not well defined cross over effect of Democrats that have had enough after a two term standard operating procedure approach to Government.  If so, there is a very definable risk to the existing elite political status quo, those arguing for a more minimalist approach (HC?) that they get fired In November. NB: Incidentally,  above-mentioned might also   have good  application  to the upcoming  Brexit & Spanish vote, as well as a few Countries here in Europe, where Populism has gained a v/ reasonable footing politically speaking. \n\nReasoning/Why: @andrewsabinsky ( AS) put together a well thought out piece on why media has completely missed the DT voter interest  http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/just-world-bias-has-twisted-media-coverage-donald-trump-campaign-1547151  Which, among other salient points, argues media/punditry inflicted by a just-world bias.  AS is definitely onto something. He might have gone even further using such terminology as \"political revolt\" or, the like. As a great example of his conclusion on how respected media/punditry have missed it is - Martin Wolf @ FT in the following piece: http://app.ft.com/cms/s/135385ca-c399-11e5-808f-8231cd71622e.html?ftcamp=crm/email/2016127/nbe/Comment/product making his case that \"economic losers\" ( whether they be in in the UK, or the US and, one might also argue Spain as well), should they be successful in revolting against the elite political status quo more moderate alternatives, would only be dealt a disastrous hand. DT just isn't a capable leader says MW. Add to this a recent BB interview w/ Ray Dalio, one of the most successful investors of our time &, head of the largest hedge fund in history. https://t.co/6kIgb4vvnZ NB: fast forward to 28 minutes where he talks about politics as it applies,to his well known model \"the economic machine\". A v/ interesting 1min 30 second of explanation of why politics DOES matter. RD does not specifically mention DT by name. However, when asked about the situation in the US, he goes on to make v/ clear with respect to how his economic machine is modeled in the US or any other Country,  when we see what is happening today; the battle b/w the \"have vs have not\" dilemma, the US or any other Country simply cannot afford an incapable, emotional leader.  So, there you have it. Absolutely top of the heap  successful & respected media & financial gurus that take a similar path. Unmistakably clear views.  The less well off public voter, may not  know what she/he may be doing by voting in the direction it seems to be going as far as the GOP. And, this will have unforeseen v/ negative consequences.  NB: There is a similar \" in vote\" campaign/debate in the UK as well. Political hysteria arguments run similar. Maintaining the status quo at all costs otherwise economic mayhem is next in line. An end result w/  an \"out\" in the UK \" would be disastrous. Scandinavian Countries along of course w/ CH have done comparatively well for quite some time now but, this doesn't apparently enter into the equation.  Perhaps, Nassim Taleb  best summarizes the opposing view most clearly in a recent tweet :  \nhttps://m.facebook.com/nntaleb/posts/10153654273663375 when he pointed, people aren't voting DT or BS, ppl are voting, finally to do away w/ the establishment. He uses more \"colorful \" language. Taleb certainly doesn't have a large impact among the general voting population 'cuz most of them don't even know who he is. That said, his prescient views over the years justify giving him good consideration. In summary, I need to work a lot more on details of a State by State direction.

Take Donald's 20% increase minus Hillary's 30% increase plus Trump's 20% increase, and you come up with 10% more people voting for Trump than Clinton."], [534, "2016-03-05T18:11:36Z", [0.2, 0.1, 0.7], "I'm reducing the odds of a Dem victory from 80 to 70%, and increasing the odds of a third-party win from 0 to 10% since Romney launched his attack on Trump and some members of the GOP establishment started talking about a third-party run against Trump. That led me to look up the rules of both allocating electoral college votes and what happens in case the electoral college can't come up with a clear majority in favor of a single candidate. Here's what I learned:  \"What is the difference between the winner-takes-all rule and proportional voting, and which states follow which rule? The District of Columbia and 48 states have a winner-takes-all rule for the Electoral College. In these States, whichever candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, or a plurality of the popular vote (less than 50 percent but more than any other candidate), takes all of the state\u2019s Electoral votes. Only two states, Nebraska and Maine, do not follow the winner-takes-all rule. In those states, there could be a split of Electoral votes among candidates through the state\u2019s system for proportional allocation of votes. For example, Maine has four Electoral votes and two Congressional districts. It awards one Electoral vote per Congressional district and two by the state-wide, \u201cat-large\u201d vote. It is possible for Candidate A to win the first district and receive one Electoral vote, Candidate B to win the second district and receive one Electoral vote, and Candidate C, who finished a close second in both the first and second districts, to win the two at-large Electoral votes. Although this is a possible scenario, it has not actually happened. What happens if no presidential candidate gets 270 Electoral votes? If no candidate receives a majority of Electoral votes, the House of Representatives elects the President from the 3 Presidential candidates who received the most Electoral votes. Each state delegation has one vote. The Senate would elect the Vice President from the 2 Vice Presidential candidates with the most Electoral votes. Each Senator would cast one vote for Vice President. If the House of Representatives fails to elect a President by Inauguration Day, the Vice-President Elect serves as acting President until the deadlock is resolved in the House.\" Source: http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/faq.html  "], [12518, "2016-03-05T17:50:23Z", [0.08, 0.0, 0.92], ""], [12471, "2016-03-05T17:39:01Z", [0.19, 0.01, 0.8], ""], [21125, "2016-03-05T17:15:58Z", [0.05, 0.0, 0.95], ""], [11885, "2016-03-05T16:12:34Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [20623, "2016-03-05T15:57:44Z", [0.35, 0.0, 0.65], "I think the best question we need to be asking ourselves is which party will be better at turning out the vote come November.

However, he is rewriting the rules of campaigning. If he also ends up rewriting the rules of GOP and national politics, traditional analytical tools of electorates (Nate Silver's \"follow the endorsements,\" etc.) would probably no longer apply.

I am increasing odds of an Other winner if Trump wins GOP nomination for two foreseeable circumstances: (a) Trump wins GOP nomination, gets pissed off by someone high up in the party, pooh-poohs the nomination and runs as an independent, and (b) a new person emerges (perhaps Bloomberg).

These runaway effects can be very, very hard to predict when they will spark, but once they do spark normal expectations go out the window.  Given that all logic pointed me to thinking he'd never get 10% as far as he already has, I increase my sense that we might be in a runaway moment. One also has to consider the incredible weakness of Hillary Clinton as a candidate, beset by scandal, less associated with the high times of the '90s and her husband's tenure (many millennials can now vote and have no memory of this golden era), doing worse in a lot of ways than she did in 2008 under more favorable conditions, the standard 2 term turnaround of party control, etc.  Overall, I think a President Cruz or a President Rubio is more likely than a President Clinton II, but the condition of this question presumes that Trump wins the GOP nomination.

He has combined to voting groups for his surprisingly good performance: those that dislike Washington, and the lesser-educated blue collar group to which his racism and bigotry appeal.

First, the easy question. Is HRC likely to win NC? No. Being in the southeast and having a large number of D-registered voters that lean republican, I'm guessing that if anything the republicans increase their margin of victory in NC for 2016. 2. Now the hard question: Can DT pick up enough EC votes to win? \n-2(a). Given his trouble in western states, I don't think he wins CO. This means that he must win FL, because PA, OH, and VA don't get him to 270. \n-2(b). Given his success in the south, I think he wins FL. My probability: 80% (He's kicking Rubio's ass there: http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/02/29/qpoll-trump-has-yuge-lead-over-everyone-in-florida-n2126007) \n-2(c).

This assessment is based upon the following assumptions/assessments as of February 27, 2016: \t1. To become POTUS, a candidate must:\n\n\t\ta. Win at least 270 Electoral College votes, based upon the popular vote in each state and D.C.; or\n\t\tb. Stop the opposition party from winning in the Electoral College, and then prevail in an election conducted in the U.S. House of Representatives under Article II, Sec. 1 of the U.S. Constitution.\n\n\t2. To win the Presidency through the Electoral College, Trump would be required to win in VA, FL, OH and CO -- a loss in any of those is highly likely to result in Trump being unable to garner the required 270 Electoral College votes. This assessment is based upon historical voting trends from the 1992 through 2012 U.S. Presidential elections. When the states which have voted Democratic at least 2/3ds of the time in those elections are allocated to the Democratic candidate, and the balance sorted by electoral votes (high to low) those states emerge as those which are determinative of the outcome in a contest between 2 candidates. Iowa could be added to this list, but using this methodology, Iowa is mathematically irrelevant if Trump were to fail in any one of the above 4 states. \n\n\t3. The probability Trump would win in ALL of those states is assessed at ~3%. He currently is ~11 pts behind in VA; nearly even in FL and OH; and ~11 pts ahead in CO. His VA weakness is based upon very high \"dislike\" for him among the VA voters -- which dislike is based upon the very behavior which has made him the GOP frontrunner in other states -- his confrontational style. Therefore, he is not likely to be able to cure the negative impact of his confrontational style with respect to the probable outcome in VA while simultaneously maintaining that style for its value elsewhere. While he could benefit from new negatives surfacing regarding a Democratic candidate (e.g., possible negative impact of Clinton Wall Street Speech transcripts; continued State Dept. email issues for Clinton), for a net positive change regarding this chance node Trump also would have to avoid additional negatives for him (e.g., problems related to the content of his tax returns; problems related to Trump University and other lawsuits). Assuming Trump's future \"negative\" events are less problematic for his candidacy Assessing Trump's likelihood of victory in VA to be 5%; in FL to be 75% (which gives him the benefit of the doubt in a currently even race); in OH to be 75% (on the same assumptions as FL); and in CO to be 90% (on assumptions more favorable to Trump in CO than employed in favor of the Democratic candidate in VA), the probability Trump would win ALL of those states is assessed at ~3% (.5 x .75 x .75 x .9 = 0.26718; \"say\" 3%).    \n\n\t4. Unless a Trump loss in more than 3 of those states is the result of a third party victory in each of them, the related Electoral College votes would be won by the Democratic nominee, which would likely be sufficient for that candidate to win at least 270 Electoral College votes and the presidency. As noted below, the probability of a third party candidate winning at least 3 of those contests is assessed at <1%.\n\n\t5. The probability a third party candidate would win in any three of VA, FL, OH & CO approaches zero. To do so, a third party candidate would need to exist, and as of this date there is no such candidacy. While former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has indicated possible interest, contingent upon whether Trump is the GOP nominee, filing deadlines for a Bloomberg candidacy will arrive before the results of the GOP nominating process have been completed. Further, existing polling data indicate that Bloomberg would have serious difficulty in mounting a credible third party campaign at this late date. Therefore, the probability that a Trump loss in 3 of 4 of VA, FL, OH & CO would be the result of a third party win in each of those lost states <1%.\n\n\t6. If a third party candidate won least 3 of those contests, the probability that as the Republican candidate Trump would be elected President by the House is >80%. The rules for such an election provide that each state delegate must vote for one of the persons who has garnered Electoral College votes, and each delegation has 1 vote. The Republican Party controls a majority of state delegations in the U.S. House. Therefore, if Trump were able to move the election from the U.S. Electorate to the U.S. House of Representatives, he would very likely be elected as President.\n\n\t7. However, a necessary limiting condition regarding a \"Victory Through the House\" scenario is the probability an election in the House would occur, in the first instance. Since that probability is assessed at <1%, the probability that Trump would win the presidency through the House is negligible, at best.\n\n\t8. Because there are ~8 months until the general election, the probability that \"unknown unknowns\" will have a material impact on the course of the various campaigns and the resulting election is arbitrarily assessed at ~10% (entropy). That uncertainty is allocated equally, 3.33% to the probability Trump would win and 3.33% to the probability the Democratic nominee would win; and 3.33% to the probability of a third party victory.\n\nTherefore, as of February 28, 2016, I assess the probability the U.S. presidential election would be won by Trump as the GOP candidate at not greater than ~6% (~3% probability of a Trump win in each of VA, FL, OH & CO + 3.33% entropy adjustment); the probability an independent candidate would win at not greater than 4% (<1% probability of victory + ~3.33% entropy adjustment); and the probability the Democratic candidate would win at  not less than ~90% (~97% probability of a \"not Trump\" outcome -  1% probability of a third party victory - 6.66% [say 7%] entropy adjustment*).  [*The Trump and third party entropy adjustments are upward, while the Democratic adjustment is downward, because entropy in this context appears more likely to favor the underdog(s); my description of the probabilities are \"not greater than\" as to Trump and a third party candidate and \"not less than\" as to the Democratic candidate; and the question presented establishes mutually exclusive outcomes.]  "], [14639, "2016-02-28T21:57:06Z", [0.3, 0.0, 0.7], "The independent voter"], [561, "2016-02-28T21:56:57Z", [0.55, 0.0, 0.45], "If the Republicans are stupid enough to actually nominate Trump, then we have to assume the majority of voters have gone over the top and will vote for the blustering, buffoonish idiot in the apparent belief this is somehow a 'protest' vote.

I'd say it's 75-80% she wins. If she does, the likelihood of an independent bid is quite low, as it has been reported that Bloomberg is unlikely to enter the race unless it is a Sanders v. Trump bid. In a head-to-head match, Clinton's favourability ratings are far higher than Trump's and have been for some time and both are well-known figures within the general electorate so it seems valid to give Clinton a substantial lead; I'm guessing but I'd say this by a 2:1 margin.\nIn the event of a Sanders victory, the situation becomes much less clear. Bloomberg's history of prevarication needs to be factored in, and another prominent independent candidate seems unlikely.

I don't know how to resolve this clash of unlikely candidates. I'm inclined to give Sanders a slight edge because Trump's favourability numbers are so bad and I'm also inclined to factor in a small chance of a win by Bloomberg or some other independent candidate in this scenario.

An unweighted average of polls taken since the beginning of 2016 has HRC over Trump by 7.7%, with a standard deviation of 6.4%[1]. Hence, HRC wins 88% of the time, and Trump wins 12% of the time. And an unweighted average of polls taken since the beginning of 2016 has Bernie over Trump by 8.1% with a standard deviation of 5.9%[2]. Thus, Bernie wins 91% of the time, and Trump wins 9% of the time. Currently, I think HRC has 91% chance of winning the Democratic primary, with Bernie following at 9%. (It's just a coincidence that the 91%/9% split shows up twice.) So that means we can carve up the probability space into four unevenly sized quadrants:  HRC wins the Democratic nomination (0.91) and beats Trump (0.88) = 0.80\nHRC wins the Democratic nomination (0.91) but loses to Trump (0.12) = 0.11\nBernie wins the Democratic nomination (0.09) and beats Trump (0.91) = 0.08\nBernie wins the Democratic nomination (0.09) but loses to Trump (0.09) = 0.01 The result is that Republicans have a 9% chance of winning the election, if Trump is the nominee.  End of story, right? Probably not. My average of polls was, as I said, unweighted, and not all polls are equal. I didn't use a weighted average because (a) the off-the-shelf weighted averages from, for example, RealClearPolitics and Pollster disagree quite sharply in some cases and (b) I don't have a reliable weighting algorithm of my own (nor am I likely to have one any time soon). Furthermore, there are very few polls to average, so sample sizes are low. And, polls at this stage of the game have limited predictive value. Finally, the presidential contest is only indirectly (though strongly) related to individual preferences for one candidate or another. It's possible to lose the popular vote but when the electoral college, as has happened within living memory.  So how to take all of the problems with the information we have into account without just throwing up our hands? I propose that following: The principle of insufficient reason[3] suggests that we should assign equal likelihood to states when the probability of their occurrence is unknown. Extending the principle a bit, we can say that we should assign equal likelihood to states when the probability of their occurrence is perfectly unknown, but we should assign a weighted average of equal likelihoods and likelihoods based on what evidence that we have when the probability of their occurrence is imperfectly unknown. For instance, an outcome might be unknown imperfectly to a degree of 75%. We could estimate this in this way: (0.75)(Outcome A*0.5 + Outcome B*0.5) + (0.25)(Outcome A*known probability of Outcome A + Outcome B*known probability of Outcome B). And so on. Call this discounting a forecast by the principle of insufficient reason, where we can discount by any real number between 0 and 1, inclusive. On the basis of all of this, I estimate we should discount the polling data above by the principle of insufficient reason at a rate of 70%. On this basis the probability that a Republican will win, given that Trump is the nominee is currently (0.7)*(0.5) + (0.3)*(0.09)=0.38. Conversely, the probability that a Democrat will win, given that Trump is the nominee is currently (0.7)*(0.5) + (0.3)*(0.91)=0.62. Furthermore, I postulate that the degree of ignorance will diminish by - let's just say - 10% points per month as we get closer to the election. So at the end of the month, I can (and will!) update the likelihood with new polling data (and anything else I can find), discounting this information by the principle of insufficient reason at a rate of 60%.

My assumptions in making this forecast: 1. Trump wins at an uncontested convention but with lip service support from the RNC (most likely though not guaranteed).\n2. Clinton wins the Democratic nomination (which I think is highly likely).\n3. There is no major third party candidate (your guess is as good as mine).\n4.

Trump's Ratings ( http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/donald-trump-favorable-rating) and Clinton's (http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/hillary-clinton-favorable-rating).\n2. Trump's Something of a Misfit in the Republican Arena: The Trump coalition is odd to say the least.

The entrance polls in Nevada show somewhat different results, but I don't give them as much credence because IA demonstrated how wrong caucus entrance polls can be. I'm getting the impression that the Republican coalition is going to have an exceptionally hard time holding together support for Trump.\n3. A true variable: Can Clinton energize young people and minority voters like Obama did? If so, she's a lock. If not, Trump's chances grow exponentially. We need to see how polls look after Sanders is officially out.\n4. True variable: Does Bloomberg jump in? If so, Clinton likely wins a plurality. Questions I have:\n1. What is the relative value of the favorability scores (i.e. At what point does an individual's dislike of Trump force them to either vote for Clinton or not vote at all and vice versa?)\n2. What states are actually in play in this scenario (i.e. We know have a lot of certainty about how some individual states will vote in this election. For example, CA and MA will go blue and MS and WY will go red. However, are swing states particularly inclined to go one direction or another based on the candidates or are typically reliable states in play? Two states I'd watch: Indiana and North Carolina. Both flipped in 2008 to Obama and then back to Romney. If they're competitive in 2016, that's a very good sign for Clinton.

Regardless of who ends up running against him on the Democratic side I would expect a Trump candidacy to mobilize Democratic voters in full force in an attempt to deny a Trump Presidency based on his very poor performance in favorability polls among Democratic voters. Since a Trump candidacy is likely to face such a strong opposition from Democratic voters he would require a very strong coalition of Republican voters in order to win the general election. With the current of the state of the Republican party being so fragmented this seems unlikely to occur, especially since Trump performs very poorly in favorability polls among moderates and independents. I have a lot of difficulty seeing him be able to succeed in the general election without winning over moderate Republican voters, even if he does mobilize the rest of the party. The only viable path to the White House I can envision for Trump is to paint the eventual Democratic nominee in such a negative light that he is able to unify the Republican party against the Democrats. This is certainly a possibility since he would be running against either a self described Democratic Socialist or an establishment Democrat who served a big role in the Obama and Bill Clinton Administrations. However I am still unsure of his ability to win over moderates and independents, and the more that the Republican establishment attacks him during the primary (which Rubio's performance during the Feb 25th Debate would point towards) the harder a job I think that becomes. As well I think there is an incredible amount for the Democrats to attack Trump on in an attempt to win over moderates.
