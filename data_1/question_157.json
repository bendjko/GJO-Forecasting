First is Mugabe's extreme age and the need for a successor should he die over the next few months. If Mugabe dies, the lack of a clear successor is likely to set off an internecine struggle between competing factions. As one of those factions is headed by Vice President Mnangagwa, who previously oversaw the mass murder of tens of thousands of opposition in the 1980s and maintains strong ties to the security services, there is strong potential for the succession struggle to rapidly devolve into mass violence. http://europe.newsweek.com/robert-mugabe-zimbabwe-428497 The second factor is the recent indication of renewed vigor by the opposition movement MDC-T, which was allowed to carry out a mass protest despite police intent to shut them down. While it is interesting that the courts overruled the police and allowed the protest to go forward, this single event likely does not indicate the police will agree to be restrained in the future if the protest become larger and more vigorous. Zimbabe has a long history of heavy-handed suppression of opposition, and the police may feel the need to respond much more forcefully in the future.  http://europe.newsweek.com/zimbabwe-mugabes-zanu-pf-dismiss-opposition-protests-448291?rm=eu Also of interest is the fact that Mugabe has apparently agreed to protect the interest of well-monied foreign interests in Zimbabwe. This may add further fuel to the protesters' complaints, which could in turn spark a heavier backlash. http://allafrica.com/stories/201604151113.html Honestly, to me it appears that only careful, deliberate devolution of power by Mugabe could avoid a mass killing, and I see no indications that this is likely.
