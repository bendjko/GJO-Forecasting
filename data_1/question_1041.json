In 2018, the average cost was $176 kWh per Bloomberg NEF.  What is the likelihood that cost reductions continue?  1.  Will demand for batteries continue to be strong?  Yes.  China is the leader in Li-ion battery production (has about 75% of the world's production capacity) and is the leader in EV and EV bus sales.  Due to strong governmental policy support and rising commitments from OEM's in China and globally, demand will continue to be strong for EV's and EV buses which will drive production and competition for Li-ion batteries.  Being price competitive with ICE is crucial to EV sales numbers and adoption rates.  Li-ion battery price reductions are the easiest way to get to that tipping point which encourages continued R&D investments to reduce Li-ion battery costs.  What are potential disruptions to this decline in costs of Li-ion batteries?  1.  Commodity supplies and prices - Li-ion batteries are sensitive to lithium, nickel, cobalt, and aluminum supplies and prices with Cobalt looking to be the most important commodity due to it scarcity.  While Cobalt is a growing concern, it is not likely to impact prices, etc. until early 2020.  In addition, wild swings in commodity prices have a fairly negligible impact on overall battery costs.  2.  New technology - a lot of news about replacing the Li-ion battery with other technology, specifically solid state batteries.  This technology is likely 5 years out so not likely to impact Li-ion demand/costs in near term.  3.  News out of Korea - Samsung and LG are rumored to be looking at increasing their battery price contracts by 10% in upcoming supply agreements.  Even if this happens, I don't see it impacting industry-wide averages very much this year.  On the whole, I anticipate a continued decrease in average costs of Li-ion batteries on par or even greater than what we have seen over the last several years.

Strategic alliances and joint ventures among technology companies and exploration companies continued to be established to ensure a reliable, diversified supply of lithium for battery suppliers and vehicle manufacturers.... Owing to continuing exploration, lithium resources have increased substantially worldwide and total more than 53 million tons.\"[1] Even with the ramp up of EV production, that's not saying shortage and an upward price. It's saying a market that is adapting to demand. Then, there is the cobalt question. Tesla has less than 3% of their battery using cobalt and is already at 190/kWh.[2] If cobalt becomes a constraining factor, companies will shift off of it. There is also the likelihood that the models academics are using is underestimating advancement: \"We find lower cost reductions than existing forecasts in the literature, which in the past has found a systematic underestimation of falling electric-vehicle battery costs,\u201d the study says.\n\nAt the battery pack level, lithium-ion needs to hit the $125 to $165 per kilowatt-hour range to compete with internal combustion engines (based on 2015 gas prices). The two-factor model predicts EV cost-competitiveness will arrive between 2017 and 2020. This is earlier than the previous literature predicts.\"[3] I'm going to go with the view that there are innovations in the design, material and manufacturing pipeline that are going to offset a straight-forward material market analysis.  Exhibit A: \"The transition from lab to commercial applications is always a tricky one. In this instance, that transition will be aided by the fact that the discovery does not require new manufacturing techniques, only an adaptation of existing production technology. Professor Wang has high expectations for the discovery he and his team have made. \u201cIn an electric vehicle, it could increase the range of a drive before needing a charge by hundreds of miles,\u201d said Wang. \u201cIt could also give smartphones a longer battery life.

This means that manufacturers can demand higher prices and make higher margins on every battery they sell. In other words, the costs of a battery are not purely a function of manufacturing (+material) costs, but also of the profit margin on top of those costs. If margins rise, the overall cost of the battery might decline more slowly than it previously has. Bloomberg suggests this has contributed to a smaller price drop in 2018 than would have otherwise been seen: \"While today\u2019s short-term shortage has forced some battery buyers to pay a premium, prices on average have nonetheless fallen this year\" \"Still, while the world waits for additional battery output, the current imbalance has at least slowed the pace of the cost declines that made today\u2019s battery boom possible.

First, the annual % decline in costs is most likely to slow down. If you look at a variety of analyses using experience curve methods (the most common method in projecting technology costs, as I wrote earlier [1]), you will see that the annual % drop reduces gradually. Therefore, simply extrapolating the 16% historical rate is likely to result in an overestimate. Second, projections based on past cost declines (such as the experience/learning curve method) treat all cost components the same. However, there it is important to distinguish between the individual cost components.  These are: * raw minerals: lithium and cobalt are the the main components in terms of cost. The price of lithium has been on a general uptrend since 2010 [2]. Cobalt has declined between 2010 and 2016 but it rose in the last few years [6]. The USGS suggests that future consumption will outpace future production, suggesting further increases [3]. More recently, a halt of production at one of the largest cobalt mine suggests potential for shortages [4]. Another projection suggests a 30% rise in 2019 [5], a yet another also projects that deficits will raise prices out to 2020 [6]. It is important to note that the major auto manufacturers have probably locked in material prices through contracts with suppliers. This means that fluctuations in prices in 2019 will have a muted impact on battery prices. But the fact that manufacturers probably have material costs locked in also means that assuming price declines for materials (as one does when one uses a simple learning curve model or extrapolates from past battery data) is probably not justified. * assembly of active materials (anode and cathode) - the costs have been falling but much more linearly than battery assembly costs [unfortunately this is from unpublished research by colleagues that I cannot cite]. * battery assembly (costs have been declining at a rapid (highly non-linear) pace due to economies of scale and learning by doing. A presentation I attended recently (unpublished, sorry) suggested that battery prices will decline by around 9-11% in 2017-2019. This is based on separate experience curve models for battery assembly and assembly of active materials + mineral cost assumptions (cobalt deficit driving higher prices) and different trend extrapolations for different raw mineral costs.  Even assuming the more optimistic 11% decline still results in a price just above 185 in 2019. However, I am still keeping a high chance of <185 as this is what was suggested by BNEF's model [1] and BNEF tracks future capacity investments more closely.

Technology costs are often modeled based on the experience curve (aka Wright's curve) which models prices as a function of built capacity (based on the notion that more capacity drives economies of scale and learning-by-doing).  BNEF has fit an experience curve to past data and makes predictions by tracking planned company capacity investments. The results of this are on slide 7 [1]. The projected price for 2019 is around $202/kWh. However, it is worth noting that their model's 2017 prediction is around 255, significantly higher than the estimated number by the Mack Institute. If we shift the curve down by 20, the 2019 would be 182. A more recent figure based on BNEF\u2019s model is here [2]. Again the absolute level is different due to different methodologies I assume. However, the model projects a 12-14% annual drops for the 2017-2019 period. If we conservatively assume a 14% drop in both 2018 and 2019 this brings the 236 number by the Mack Institute to 175. An alternative (less trustworthy) source suggests a figure closer to 200. [3] But more importantly this source also projects cost declines around 10-12% per year between 2017 and 2019. It is worth noting that experience curve models do not account well for the prices of materials. While manufacturing costs can indeed be modeled as a function of built capacity (as learning effects make manufacturing more efficient), the costs of materials is driven by a number of additional factors. Ideally, we\u2019d have a two-part model that estimates manufacturing costs as a function of capacity and estimates material costs separately. For now, I am simplifying and just taking into account uncertainty in material costs. Material prices can move substantially based on volatility in global markets. So what are the main components of a Li-ion battery? Some of them main ones are:\n- Lithium\n- Cobalt\n- Nickel\nFor now I assume a typical annual volatility in the prices of these materials of 20% (i.e. 95% of scenarios fall within +/- 20%). BNEF has an analysis of the sensitivities of batteries to changes in the prices of these materials [4]. For Lithium a 20% price change translates to roughly 4% change in battery cost. For cobalt it\u2019s around 3% and for nickel it\u2019s around 0.1% The most extreme scenario would be for all to become 20% cheaper/more expensive, translating roughly to 7% change in battery prices. If we take our 175 number and apply a 7% downward adjustment that would be 162. This suggests that the first two buckets are very unlikely.

A quick scan of the literature has everyone saying it will be <$200/kWh There are also more aggressive numbers.
