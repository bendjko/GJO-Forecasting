The move is a more limited version of a similar set of U.S. decisions earlier this year which targeted close to 300 people, including 271 employees of the Syria Scientific Studies and Research Centre. The EU measures will also hit scientists at the center, a Syrian government agency that Washington says is responsible for producing chemical and ballistic weapons, according to U.K. officials. The EU sanctions are set to be adopted on Monday at a meeting of the bloc\u2019s foreign ministers. The exact list of targets won\u2019t be known until the names are published Tuesday morning in the bloc\u2019s official journal of record. However, U.K. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson confirmed the decision Sunday night, saying the British government \u201cwill continue to work closely with our international partners to hold perpetrators to account.\u201d The decision was confirmed by two other European sources. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons last year said there were several cases of chlorine use as a chemical weapon by the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad (para. 1-7).

Such a step , which must surely be based upon detailed intelligence, might usually be delivered behind the scenes through diplomatic channels.\nThe use of chemical weapons requires tell-tale preparations such as the movement of particular units, the distribution of weapons to a base from which they can be delivered and so on, all capable of being picked up by US satellites or drones.\nThe warning is clearly intended to forestall such an attack and to make it clear that if the Syrian regime again crosses this line - just as it did last April - the US will respond with force.\nThis time though the context is very different.

The White House said in a statement released late on Monday the preparations by Syria were similar to those undertaken before an April 4 chemical attack that killed dozens of civilians and prompted U.S. President Donald Trump to order a cruise missile strike on a Syrian air base. \"The United States has identified potential preparations for another chemical weapons attack by the Assad regime that would likely result in the mass murder of civilians, including innocent children,\" White House spokesman Sean Spicer said. \"If ... Mr. Assad conducts another mass murder attack using chemical weapons, he and his military will pay a heavy price,\" he said (para 1-4). Assad said in an interview with the AFP news agency earlier this year that the alleged April attack was \"100 percent fabrication\" used to justify a U.S. air strike (para. 8). The strike was the toughest direct U.S. action yet in Syria's six-year-old civil war, raising the risk of confrontation with Russia and Iran, Assad's two main military backers.

Defeated by 10 votes in favour, to 2 against (Bolivia, Russian Federation), with 3 abstentions (China, Ethiopia, Kazakhstan), the draft would have emphasized Syria\u2019s obligation to comply with the recommendations of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapon\u2019s (OPCW) Fact Finding Mission and the OPCW-United Nations Joint Investigative Mechanism by providing immediate and unfettered access to and the right to inspect any and all sites.  Tabled by France, the United Kingdom and the United States, it would have requested the Secretary-General to report on the issue every 30 days pursuant to resolution 2118 (2013), in which the Council had decided that, among other things, Syria would not use, develop, produce, acquire, stockpile or retain chemical weapons. Before the action, the Russian Federation\u2019s delegate, saying the draft failed to serve a useful purpose, requested that an independent investigation be launched immediately on the incident in Khan Shaykhun. Following the vote, speakers agreed on the need for a swift, impartial investigation and for perpetrators to be held accountable for the reported chemical attacks.  Ethiopia\u2019s speaker expressed regret over the disunity in the Council, emphasizing that Council members had agreed on the thrust of the text. Many speakers echoed that regret.  The Council\u2019s inability to act had sent a message that perpetrators could \u201cget away with murder\u201d, said Ukraine\u2019s delegate.  \u201cToday, I feel ashamed.  This vote was a credibility test for the Council and we have not passed it.\u201d The representative of the United States, whose country holds the Council presidency for April, said in her national capacity that the text had included information that was obvious:  that Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime must provide access to sites.  If the Assad regime was innocent, the information in the text would have vindicated it.  Having voted for the eighth time against a resolution on Syria, the Russian Federation was further isolating itself (para. 1-7). United Nations Security Council Website. (2017).

With such support, Assad might feel embolden to use them again if it appears the rebels might gain a strategic advantage. Which would then result in an emergency meeting that will likely result in no action due to Russia's veto power.
