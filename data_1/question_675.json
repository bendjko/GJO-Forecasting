Found out there are influenza positive and negative viruses. I downloaded the flunet's laboratory surveillance information on Qatar and download the who year's listing on influenza positive viruses. Found out that the latest figure is 116 in week 42 (2017) but there is no clear trend curve in any direction. Then I downloaded previous year's charts and in 2016 in week 46 the number has been 139 and 2015 it was 576 and 2014 it has been 33. So I came up with a resolution that the scope of epidemic is extremely hard to forecast, but I will base my estimation on the fact that 2014 was a massive outbreak. the trend should be decreasing, if there are any lessons learned. In addition Qatar is vaccinating people long before the outbreak. There's an article in FluNet where it is said that there has been vaccinations on healthcare workers. And they have succeeded very well after the outbreak of 2015. That's why I made an edit of decreasing the changes of more than 120 but less than 200. Perhaps that still could be decreased. I hope my reasoning can help you guys as well. Maybe the figures could still be updated later on this week. Every time I edit, does it make a new forecast? just thinking, because isn't the point to update the forecasts?"], [41418, "2017-11-17T09:36:11Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.7, 0.18, 0.02], "Comment deleted on Nov 17, 2017 10:34AM UTC"], [29646, "2017-11-17T04:35:16Z", [0.0, 0.3, 0.65, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [40733, "2017-11-17T03:51:49Z", [0.0, 0.28, 0.52, 0.14, 0.06], ""], [37379, "2017-11-17T03:32:15Z", [0.0, 0.25, 0.65, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [23234, "2017-11-17T01:57:50Z", [0.01, 0.2, 0.55, 0.19, 0.05], ""], [41262, "2017-11-16T21:56:10Z", [0.0, 0.36, 0.6, 0.04, 0.0], ""], [15548, "2017-11-16T16:08:50Z", [0.0, 0.34, 0.66, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [28414, "2017-11-16T10:44:35Z", [0.0, 0.25, 0.7, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [28414, "2017-11-16T10:44:13Z", [0.0, 0.25, 0.65, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [29646, "2017-11-15T22:51:34Z", [0.0, 0.3, 0.65, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [31450, "2017-11-15T22:08:40Z", [0.0, 0.25, 0.65, 0.1, 0.0], "Shifting a little higher to account for the number of cases in the last few weeks."], [40642, "2017-11-15T20:01:48Z", [0.0, 0.43, 0.57, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [39537, "2017-11-15T19:45:19Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.7, 0.2, 0.1], ""], [691, "2017-11-15T15:22:17Z", [0.0, 0.35, 0.65, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [13377, "2017-11-15T02:46:34Z", [0.0, 0.3, 0.65, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [35036, "2017-11-14T23:22:46Z", [0.0, 0.39, 0.57, 0.04, 0.0], "As by now recent data is available, I'm basing my forecast on a moving average (4 weeks) and corresponding moving standard deviation.

It is highly unlikely that less than 27 confirmed cases are during one of the highest points of the season. Thus the probability was put at 2%.  Previous data suggests that the around the 45th week of the year is potential increase in outbreaks, specifically 2013 being the biggest. If we consider 2013 an outlier then data predicts a normal influenza season. If conditions hold with a mild spike occurring around the 45th week then between 27-120 is the most likely outcome.  However past results do not predicate future outcomes. With the rise of super bugs and how previously the influenza vaccine did not cover the most predominant strains in 2013 & 2015. We are on tract for a large spike then normal.  The influenza vaccine does not immunize the host against all forms of the virus but rather forms that are predicted to have the largest impact on the general populace. There is some evidence to suggest given the reports coming from New Zealand and Australia that there is more to fear this year. Britains NHS is gearing up for a bad flu season due to this speculation, However it should be noted that Britain has an aging population compared to Qatar which could lead to higher infection rates there. Hong Kong had a major influenza outbreak over the summer which doctors have likely attributed to mutation of the virus. The previous mild winter flu season is suggested to have contributed to the high outbreaks this year, due to lack of natural immunity. Qatar's health ministry has launched a influenza awareness campaign for vaccination.  Given the large number of foreign workers who travel often the likelihood one contracts influenza is extremely high. Given the lack of herd immunity within the developing country, any outbreak will likely be magnified.  Prediction for X < 27 or less cases is 2%\nA prediction for 27 - 120 is placed at 54% is for previous data suggesting a normal season all else equal.\nThe prediction of 120 < X < 200 is 37% for the higher levels of influenza experienced by neighbouring countries.\nA prediction for 200 - 293 is pegged at 7% for the lack of herd immunity, religious festivals,  Note: the 2% and 7% are also hedges against availability biases, and black swans.

There are some clues - Australia and New Zealand have had a bad year, due to a strain not covered by the annual vaccination, so the Northern Hemisphere is bracing for the worst (even though the vaccination has been reformulated). Although Qatar does not have a cold \"winter\" as such, the change in weather starting from November does lead to increased respiratory problems, so there could be a seasonal increase in cases.\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/09/12/nhs-fears-worst-flu-season-history/\nhttps://www.statnews.com/2017/10/16/flu-virus-severity/ How fast can one expect flu to spread? The median \"Reproduction Number\" of typical seasonal flu is around 1.2-1.4, compared to around 1.8 for pandemics. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4169819/ In a population with zero immunity, one flu case will therefore infect between 1 and 2 more of those that come in contact with it. However, if around 50% of the exposed population is immune, either through vaccination or prior exposure to this particular strain, then the infection is not expected to spread. Most of Qatar's population consists of itinerant expatriate workers, who are unlikely to have been vaccinated this year, and if this is a new strain not many will have been exposed to it before either. The  comings and goings of the workforce means new viruses can come in and spread quickly. Confirmation of the Qatar figures can be seen in this recent report from the UAE, which has similar demographics and environment.\nhttp://gulfnews.com/news/uae/health/influenza-virus-highly-active-in-the-uae-1.1917646 If it becomes generally known that this year's flu will be more severe than usual, more people will visit the doctor whereas in other years they may just rest and recover, so we could expect proportionally more cases to be reported.
