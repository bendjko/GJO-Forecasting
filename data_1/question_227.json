The unusual deal and U.S. response exposed a disconnect in the anti-Islamic State coalition on the eve of a pivotal offensive to retake Raqqa, the extremist group\u2019s biggest Syrian stronghold. And it called into question whether the U.S. military will honor battlefield commitments made by its partners. The deal with Islamic State helped U.S.-backed forces end a months long battle with Islamic State for Tabqa Dam, a strategic stronghold the extremist group has held since late-2013. To bring the battle to an end, the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces allowed about 70 Islamic State fighters safe passage if they dismantled hidden bombs and gave up their heavy weapons, said Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman. The U.S.-backed fighters made the deal to protect civilians and ensure that Islamic State didn\u2019t destroy the dam, which could have posed a risk to communities in the flood zone, Capt. Davis said. But the U.S. military didn\u2019t take part in the deal or agree to ensure safe passage for Islamic State fighters, Capt. Davis said, making them fair game. As the fighters left, the U.S. military tracked them and targeted those who could be killed without potential harm to civilians, he said. \u201cThis was an agreement for them to leave the Tabqa Dam and to leave the remaining portions of the city they held, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that when we see ISIS fighters on the battlefield and we have a clean shot at them, we will continue to take it,\u201d he said. Capt. Davis declined to answer whether the U.S. is bound in any way when an ally like the Syrian Defense Forces make an agreement on the battlefield. \u201cI think SDF let them have safe passage out of Tabqa, but once they continued on the battlefield, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s something we\u2019re required to honor,\u201d he said.

The two leaders spoke by phone for the first time since U.S. relations with Russian were strained by the U.S. attack on a Syrian airfield. They two leaders set the foundation for what could be their first face-to-face meeting in July. Statements from both the White House and the Kremlin suggested the two leaders had a productive conversation that included North Korea and fighting Islamist militants throughout the Middle East. A senior Trump administration official said Putin had requested the call and described it as an effort to present his ideas for Syria. Trump ordered 59 cruise missiles launched in retaliation for a chemical weapons attack that the United States blamed on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The attacked prompted protests from Assad ally Russia, which blamed Syrian rebels for the use of outlawed nerve gas and said Assad was not at fault. The White House said the two leaders agreed that \"all parties must do all they can to end the violence\" in Syria. \"The conversation was a very good one, and included the discussion of safe, or de-escalation, zones to achieve lasting peace for humanitarian and many other reasons,\" a White House statement said. Trump during his presidential campaign last year frequently said he wanted safe zones established for Syrian refugees, paid for by Gulf states, to alleviate any need for the refugees to move elsewhere, including to the United States. Candidate Trump had also expressed a desire for a U.S. alliance with Russia to fight Islamist militants, a goal that has been elusive since he took office on Jan. 20. With a ceasefire ever elusive in Syria, the White House said Washington would send a representative to ceasefire talks in Astana, Kazakhstan, on Wednesday and Thursday. The State Department said acting Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs Stuart Jones will attend as an observer. The decision to send Jones to the talks, even as an observer, is an indication that the United States is taking the Astana talks more seriously. Previously, the U.S. ambassador to Kazakhstan George Krol had attended the talks as an observer. The Kremlin said Putin and Trump agreed to step up dialogue on finding ways to strengthen a ceasefire and give it stability (para. 1-14). Holland, S. & Winning, A. (2017).

However, there are also suggestions that Trump will sign an executive order paving the way for providing arms to the YPG in a direct way.  \u201cThe timing of the big Raqqa operation is apparently to be set in line with the Erdo\u011fan-Trump meeting in Washington. The Trump administration had preferred to launch the offensive on Raqqa after the accomplishment of the referendum process in Turkey in order not to make such an important anti-terror fight a domestic political issue in an allied country.  \u201cNow the expectation is to issue the presidential order for Raqqa after Erdo\u011fan\u2019s meetings in Washington as preparations in the field have visibly intensified in recent weeks. \n\n\u201cAs there is little chance of reaching a consensus over the YPG\u2019s role in the anti-ISIL fight, the State Department has been trying to find ways to balance U.S. policies toward Turkey by submitting a positive agenda during Erdo\u011fan\u2019s visit.

The officials, citing the need to safeguard operations in Syria, declined to specify exactly what measures the United States has taken after the strikes, which Damascus, Tehran and Moscow have roundly condemned. They spoke on condition of anonymity. Asked about the Reuters report, a U.S. military spokesman later told a Pentagon news briefing that the U.S. commander for the campaign has been \"calling in the resources that he needs\" to protect U.S. forces in the wake of the strikes. The spokesman, Colonel John Thomas, also said U.S. strikes in Syria had become more defensive and acknowledged the pace had slowed somewhat since last Friday. \"I don't think that is going to last for very long, but that is up to (Lieutenant General Stephen) Townsend,\" Thomas said, stressing there had been no attempts by Syria or its allies to retaliate against U.S. troops so far. President Donald Trump ordered the cruise missile strike on Syria's Shayrat air base last week in response to what Washington and its allies say was a poison gas attack by Syria's military in which scores of civilians died. It was the first-time Washington has directly targeted Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government in six years of civil war, and has pushed Trump's administration into proclaiming that Washington still wants Assad eventually removed from power (para. 1-7).

US President Donald Trump, who was initially resistant to the idea of becoming involved in Syria, radically changed his stance following the chemical attack and said the strike was \"in the vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons.\" \"Tonight, I call on all civilized nations to join us in seeking to end the slaughter and bloodshed in Syria and also to end terrorism of all kinds and all types,\" Trump said Thursday, when the attack took place in Eastern Time. The Kremlin and the Syrian government, which have worked together during Syria's civil war, were quick to condemn the attack, with Moscow calling the attack an \"aggression against a sovereign state in violation of international law, and under a false pretext.\" Many other nations, however, have praised the US's intervention. Here's a list of the reactions of those who were in favour and those who condemned the strike: In favor United Kingdom: Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said the UK government gave its full support to the US over the attacks, saying the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime in Syria passed a clear red line in international law. \"The American Defense Secretary Jim Mattis consulted me early yesterday evening about our assessment of the regime's culpability for the chemical weapons attack and we reviewed the need to understand and to deal with any likely Russian reactions to the attack,\" Fallon told the BBC (para. 1-8).

Trump said the attack in Syria's Idlib province was \"reprehensible and cannot be ignored by the civilized world,\" although he also sought to blame his predecessor, Barack Obama. \"These heinous actions by the Bashar al-Assad regime are a consequence of the last administration's weakness and irresolution,\" Trump said in a statement. \"President Obama said in 2012 that he would establish a 'red line' against the use of chemical weapons and then did nothing.\" The Syrian military denied responsibility and said it would never use chemical weapons. The chemical weapons attack on Tuesday, which killed scores of people, including children, came a week after both Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said their focus in Syria was on stopping Islamic State militants rather than pushing Assad to leave power. A senior Trump administration official said on Tuesday the government was looking at policy options after the attack in Idlib but that the options were limited and that the views expressed by Tillerson and Haley still held. \"Nothing has changed in terms of that dynamic. Our ability to get rid of him doesn\u2019t rise because he does something terrible,\" the official said. France's foreign minister said the suspected chemical weapons attack was a way of testing the Trump administration and urged Washington to clarify its position on Assad. \"The question is to know, yes or no, whether the Americans support a political transition in Syria, which means organizing this transition, elections and that at the end of the process the question of Assad's departure is asked,\" Jean-Marc Ayrault told RTL radio. A member of the Syrian opposition said the attack was a \"direct consequence\" of the recent U.S. statements on Assad. Another senior U.S. official said Saudi Arabia and Turkey, both key allies against Islamic State, had indicated the militant group was a higher priority than ousting Assad and that his removal would only add to the chaos in the region (para. 1-11).

The United States has expanded its investigation into a formal review of all airstrikes over several days in the area, the U.S. military said Thursday. A U.S. team visited the site of the airstrike, a house where civilians were located was hit, a defense official told CNN. The official said other factors might have played into the deaths, including the Islamic State attempting to deceive targets.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley on Thursday drew criticism for playing down a long-standing U.S. goal of persuading Assad to leave power to help end the six-year-long Syrian civil war. Tillerson said Assad's future is up to the Syrian people to decide, while Haley said \"our priority is no longer to sit there and focus on getting Assad out.\" At his daily news briefing, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said that regarding Assad, \"there is a political reality that we have to accept in terms of where we are right now.\" Spicer blamed the inability of Trump's predecessor, Democrat Barack Obama, to persuade Assad to step down. The Obama administration, in its later years, was focused on reaching a deal with Russia that would eventually see Assad go, though it also shifted its focus to the fight against Islamic State militants, who captured swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria in 2014. \"We had an opportunity and we need to focus now on defeating ISIS,\" Spicer said. \"The United States has profound priorities in Syria and Iraq and we've made it clear that counterterrorism, particularly the defeat of ISIS, is foremost among those priorities\" (para. 1-7).

The two sides do not meet but negotiate via U.N. mediator Staffan de Mistura, saving their liveliest invective for the TV cameras after each meeting with him. Opposition negotiator Nasr al-Hariri said the \"terrorist regime\" of President Bashar al-Assad had refused to discuss political transition during the talks and said Assad was a war criminal who must step down in the name of peace. \"They are solely discussing their empty rhetoric about countering terrorism,\" Hariri told reporters, vowing there could be \"no peace without justice.\" \"War crimes and crimes against humanity must not be an option for negotiations. From now, venues must be found for transitional justice to ensure holding the perpetrators accountable,\" he said. Hariri said he was looking for a negotiating partner who put the interests of the Syrian people first, while his opposite number, the government's chief negotiator, Bashar al Ja'afari, said he only wanted to negotiate with someone \"patriotic\". Ja'afari mocked the opposition delegation as \"adolescents\" who thought they were appearing on a television talent show such as \"Arab Idol\" or \"The Voice\", and were under the illusion that government would simply hand over the keys to the country. \"In fact, they are tools, they are mercenaries in the hands of their lords, their operators, and it seems they have not received instructions from them, except instructions to continue supporting terrorism and to create havoc in these rounds\" (para. 1-8).

The army and Turkish-backed Syrian rebels have captured several towns, including Jarablus, finally moving south to the strategic town of Al-Bab. The Turkish operation was also aimed at preventing the Kurdish Popular Protection Units (YPG) from gaining more ground in northern Syria, which Ankara fears would fuel an insurgency being waged by the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in south-eastern Turkey.

Army surface-to-surface Himars rockets, which are based in northern Syria, are also part of the mission. American Special Operations forces were advising the Syrian fighters on the ground, although a military spokesman said they were not involved in direct, front-line combat. \u201cThe mission represented a new stage in the broader offensive to cut off and seize Raqqa. Its objective was to take control of the Tabqa Dam on the Euphrates River near Lake Assad, the nearby town of Tabqa and a local airfield. An immediate goal was to take the dam intact . . . .officials said that the fighting was intense.  \u201cThe fighting is raging on as I speak and is expected to last several weeks until the dam, airfield and city are free from ISIS control,\u201d said Col. Joseph E. Scrocca, a spokesman for the American-led command in Baghdad. \u201cAs the battle for Raqqa has accelerated, the number of airstrikes has climbed. . . . over the past four months the American-led coalition had conducted more than 300 such strikes around Tabqa and west of Raqqa, and that enemy fighters, fortifications and vehicles had been targeted. \u201cDescribing the Tabqa operation, American officials said that a ground force of Syrian fighters was approaching the dam from the north. The airlift was carried out south of the dam, Colonel Scrocca said, and appeared to take the militants by surprise. . .News reports suggested 500 Syrian fighters had been deployed, but American officials hinted it could be much more.\u201cIt could be 500; it could be a heck of a lot more,\u201d Colonel Scrocca said in a briefing that was broadcast into the Pentagon. \u201cSo far, the Trump administration has been operating within the broad contours of the approach by the Obama administration . . . But the Trump White House has dispensed with the detailed and often prolonged review of operations and tactics that were conducted under the Obama administration. The change has allowed American commanders to step up the pace of their operations. \u201cPentagon officials said that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was informed of the Tabqa operation, as was the White House, but the assault was being carried out within the authority that has been delegated to American military commanders. \u201cMore flexibility for American commanders appears to be coming. Representative Mac Thornberry, Republican of Texas Republican and the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, told reporters Wednesday that he expected the White House to remove \u201cartificial troop caps\u201d in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. \u201cThe current \u201cforce manning level\u201d for Syria sets a limit on the number of American military personnel in Syria at 503. But the limit does not count temporary reinforcements, like the roughly 400 personnel who were deployed in Syria when the Marine artillery battery and Army Rangers were sent to the country. \u201cThere was another telling indication on Wednesday that American Special Operations would continue to play an important role. Col. Jonathan P. Braga, the chief of staff of the Joint Special Operations Command and the former deputy commander of Delta Force, has been named as the next senior operations officer for the American-led command that is leading the campaign against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  If the fighting for the Tabqa Dam and its city which is about 15 miles from Raqqa is expected to take several weeks, it seems unlikely that Raqqa could be retaken before June 1st."], [38, "2017-03-23T22:08:27Z", [0.0, 0.07, 0.93], "Anti-ISIS action seems to be focused on cities 15-20 miles east and west of Raqqa, not in Raqqa itself."], [368, "2017-03-23T15:48:37Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [691, "2017-03-23T15:03:53Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [1034, "2017-03-23T07:52:41Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "U.S.-led coalition airdrops forces in Raqqa province Francis and Perry (2017) Wed Mar 22, states that: The U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State has for the first-time airdropped local ground forces behind enemy lines near the ISIS-held town of Tabqa in northern Syria, the Pentagon said on Wednesday, opening a new front in the campaign to recapture nearby Raqqa city. The U.S. military had airlifted allied Syrian Arab militia fighters near Tabqa, providing them fire support in a move aimed at retaking a major dam that remains in the hands of Islamic State, also known as ISIS, the Pentagon said at a news conference in Washington. U.S. troops took part in the operation, at least flying to the site. Colonel Joseph Scrocca, a coalition spokesman, declined to say whether U.S. advisers were on the ground, but left open that possibility. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a militia alliance including Arab and Kurdish fighters, said the operation also aimed to block any advance by Syrian government forces from the west. Islamic State captured the Tabqa Dam, also known as the Euphrates Dam, and a nearby major air base at the height of its expansion in Syria and Iraq in 2014. It is located about 40 km (25 miles) to the west of Raqqa city. The campaign to capture Raqqa appears to be gathering pace as an overlapping, U.S.-backed effort in Iraq is drawing closer to driving Islamic State from Mosul. A local official familiar with SDF operations said the airdrop took place on Tuesday. The SDF, which includes the powerful Kurdish YPG militia, is fighting to encircle Raqqa city with support from the coalition, including air support and backing on the ground from U.S. special forces. Scrocca said Apache helicopters, Marine artillery, U.S. special operations forces and air strikes were involved in the operation. About 75 to 80 percent of the forces were members of the Syria Arab Coalition, and Kurds were among the remainder, he added. The operation could take several weeks, Scrocca said. \"This is the first time that we have conducted an air movement or an air assault with the Syrian Arab Coalition and the SDF, (I) don't know if it'll be the last.\" The landing forces had seized four small villages in the area west of Tabqa and cut a main highway that links the provinces of Raqqa, Deir al-Zor and Aleppo, it said (para. 1-11).

It is slow, dangerous work that must be done block by block rather than in large-scale air attacks.  . . .

Russia\u2019s forces in Syria were meant to prop up the Assad regime and were successful in doing so.

Now there are the U.S. Central Command-backed (CENTCOM) Syria Democratic Forces (SDF) positioned to the north of Raqqa. Raqqa and its south are occupied by ISIL. The Russians made a surprise move to head towards Raqqa in support of Syrian regime forces and take over positions in and around the town of Manbij, west of Raqqa, from the control of the People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG) on March 3. That stopped the march of Turkey-backed Free Syria Army (FSA) rebels on Manbij amid Turkish objections due to the YPG presence there. \"Turkish President Tayyip Erdo\u011fan suggests that the United States should abandon the YPG as a partner, so that the Turkish army and the Arab rebels will join forces with the U.S. and retake Raqqa from ISIL.  That scenario has lost ground after a meeting called by Turkey in Antalya on March 7-8  \"The Russian military is providing assistance to the Turkish military, according to a de-conflict protocol, in order to avoid producing any unintended clashes between them and the Syrian regime forces, provided that the Turks move only on ISIL, not the YPG, . . .  military wing of the Democratic Union Party (PYD), which is the Syria extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), which has been fighting against Turkey for more than three decades.  \"After the Antalya meeting, the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria, which owes its endurance to Russia, filed an official complaint to the United Nations against Turkey, asking it to leave its territory.  \"On March 20, Reuters reported that Russian might give military training to YPG militia in and around Afrin, west of Syria very close to the Turkish border. \"CENTCOM has deployed heavy weaponry to the region, which is an indication that it will not require a Turkish deployment for the Raqqa operation, while the U.S. State Department has also said it wants to carry on with the YPG, despite objections from NATO ally Turkey. Meanwhile, we are all still waiting for a call from . . .  Trump about the operation. The Americans think the Turkish proposal would require brand new planning, which would mean a greater budget, time and energy and dependence on two foreign armies (Turkey and U.S.), rather than local forces, which could lead to \u201ca new wave of extremism.\u201d \"However, the Turkish government is still waiting for the official announcement of the U.S. administration, while also being in the midst of the campaign for the April 16 referendum on shifting to an executive presidential system. \"If the Turkish proposal \u2013 either in modified form or as it currently stands - is rejected by Trump, it will leave two major possible scenarios regarding taking Raqqa back from ISIL: \"1- The Russians and the Syrian regime leaving the Raqqa operation to the U.S.-led coalition and focusing on Deyr az-Zor. That would mean Russian-backed regime forces marching southeast, along the west bank of the Euphrates River, and not bothering for now with the east bank. The U.S. forces would continue marching on Raqqa to take it from the hands of ISIL together with the SDF, (which has the YPG as its backbone), despite Turkey\u2019s objections. CENTCOM has been working with the YPG ever since they did not allow the Syrian border town of Kobane to fall into the hands of ISIL in the fall of 2014, and later on during the capture of Haseke and Manbij. On paper, this operation could be open to a Turkish contribution, but Ankara is not likely to accept this because of the YPG presence. But YPG forces are not likely to be allowed to settle in Raqqa because of the possible reaction from the Arab population there and the Arab elements of the SDF.  \"2- Alternatively, the Russia-backed Syrian regime forces may decide to cross the Euprahtes and march on Raqqa. In that case, one of two things might happen. ISIL could choose not to get involved in an intense fight against the Syrian forces (which have heavy weapons and air support), and retreat (as they did in Jarablus during Turkey\u2019s Euphrates Shield operation) to Palmyra, Deyr az-Zor, or further east to Iraqi territories. Or ISIL might choose to dig in and fight for Raqqa as its political headquarters. The U.S. is not likely to get involved in a confrontation with the Russia-backed Syria army, and in need of more ground forces the Syrian regime could cut a deal with the Syrian Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD) and its armed wing the YPG. The YPG might then continue the fight against ISIL, not under U.S. protection but under Russian-Syrian protection. The Turkish army is not likely to be either invited or willing to take part in such an operation.  \"In both of these scenarios, the big missing factor is Iran, which actually has the biggest fighting force in both Syria and Iraq, second to the armies of both regimes. With the Quds Force, the foreign operations unit of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards, plus a number of Iran-leaning Shiite militia and the pro-Iranian Lebanese Hezbollah, Iran exercises an important presence. Tehran and Moscow have good relations as the two major countries supporting the al-Assad regime, but that does not mean their interests are identical. \"After Hezbollah and pro-Iran militia were recently seen in the vicinity of the Golan Heights, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netenyahu immediately flew to Moscow on March 9 to talk to Russian President Vladimir Putin and ask him to keep Iran away from Israel\u2019s borders. However, that did not solve any problems, and when an Israeli jet bombed pro-Iran forces near Palmyra on March 19, Russia protested and asked Israel not to repeat the incident. \"Clearly, the picture is getting increasingly complicated as time passes, while the calendar for the Raqqa offensive against ISIL also gets increasingly pressing.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENTS:  I'm keeping in mind that the first source is Russian and the 2nd is Turkish.

The US military wants to work with local forces against the Islamic State in Raqqa, but still is working out many of the details, including who should hold what ground after IS is defeated. \"The US Central Command remains strongly in favor of moving ahead with the Syrian Kurdish group known as the People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG) and their Arab allies who operate under the umbrella of the Syrian Defense Forces (SDF). But concerns over Turkey, a critical NATO ally, are holding up plans to arm and train the SDF under the terms of a special presidential dispensation known as Section 1209 that permits the Pentagon to arm nonstate foreign militias. Turkey has repeatedly warned against giving the YPG modern sophisticated weapons, saying the group could transfer these to its ally, the Kurdistan Workers Party, which is fighting for autonomy inside Turkey. \"Trump has not signed Section 1209 for the SDF yet even though the Obama administration recommended he do so. The announcement of a final decision on Raqqa has likely been put off until after Turkey votes in a referendum April 16 that would formalize the sweeping powers President Recep Tayyip Erdogan already wields. Washington is worried that Erdogan will use the issue to whip up further anti-Americanism and take further aggressive action against the YPG in Syria to boost nationalist votes. \"Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis is said to be among those raising red flags over the long-term effects of acting in concert with a group that Turkey views as terrorists. \u201cHe\u2019s thinking beyond Erdogan and focusing on the partnership with Turkey, and how this will impact relations in the long term,\u201d . . . . . Some administration officials participating in the debate are arguing in favor of postponing Raqqa, saying that IS \u2014 under assault from all sides and its access to Europe via Turkey now cut off \u2014 no longer poses an immediate threat. \"That position is said to be embraced by some members of the international coalition, notably Britain, which has close political and commercial ties to Turkey. These have become even more valuable to Britain amid its growing isolation over Brexit. UK officials privately say they have zero interest in helping promote the Syrian Kurds\u2019 aspirations for political autonomy. \"But the debate over Raqqa is not limited to Turkey, and administration officials say that in all likelihood CENTCOM\u2019s wishes to proceed with the SDF will be respected. \"Trump administration officials are focusing on the broader fight against IS and how to ensure that it does not return once it is pushed out. The Syrian Kurds have a track record of being able to work with the Syrian regime, as they recently did in Manbij where they ceded control over a string of villages to regime forces to hold attacking Turkish-led forces at bay. Could this become a blueprint for Raqqa? Some administration officials think so. Nicholas A. Heras, a Bacevich fellow at the Center for a New American Security with deep knowledge of the region, has been closely following the conversation in the Trump administration over how to move forward in Syria. He shared his insights in an interview with Al-Monitor. The text of some of the highlights follows: \n. . . \nHeras:  The Trump team is trying to avoid as much as possible an American military mandate in Syria, and American withdrawal and subsequent partner failure to prevent the return of ISIS. \n. . . \nHeras:  Turkey has a weak hand because the SDF has demonstrated that it can cut a deal with Assad to connect the cantons of Rojava. Turkey would also have to invest in a large military occupation of Syria to be the hold force for Raqqa, which would be expensive as it fights a civil war with the PKK in eastern Turkey.\n. . . Turkey has to ask itself whether it wants to have an indefinite Turkish military mandate over suspicious Arab tribes in eastern Syria far from its southern border. In essence, that is what the United States is asking Turkey to commit to if Erdogan wants to be the force that has the prestige of conquering Raqqa.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  I'd thought this might happen soon--before the heat of summer--because Trump loves winning and Raqqa is not that large of a town, but the Trump team has  not forgotten \"Mission Accomplished\", and seems to be giving this issue careful review and analysis, so I'm changing my forecast.   There's still a chance that CENTCOM will have its way, though.

With the self-styled caliphate rapidly shrinking in Iraq after the loss of much of Mosul, the fall of Raqqa and Islamic State\u2019s remaining territories in Syria has become just a matter of time. The contest over who gets these spoils, however, threatens to unleash a new spiral of violence that could draw regional and global powers deeper into the conflict. The three forces aiming for Raqqa\u2014Sunni Arab rebels, the Syrian regime and Kurdish-led militias\u2014all view control over that area as giving them crucial leverage in any political settlement of the war. The complicated dynamic is further muddled by the strategic calculations of their main sponsors, whose own interests extend far beyond the power struggle inside Syria. Turkey, the main supporter of the rebel Free Syrian Army and allied Sunni Arab militias, is most interested in weakening the main Syrian Kurdish political faction, which is affiliated with the PKK, or Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party. The PKK is waging a violent campaign inside Turkey and is considered a terrorist group by Washington and Ankara alike. For Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who sent troops to fight alongside the FSA in northern Syria last August, winning the April 16 referendum on vastly expanding his own powers represents an even more important priority. He has little to gain in the referendum campaign from a dramatic escalation of the Syrian conflict. For the Syrian regime\u2019s main backer Russia, which has developed ties with the Syrian Kurds and, of late, with some Sunni Arab rebels, the main goal is to capitalize on its costly investment in Syria and to cement the achievements of its military campaign through a political deal. The Trump administration, meanwhile, is still reviewing its Syria policy. Its actions, for now, remain driven almost exclusively by the military priorities in the battle against Islamic State, with limited attention to America\u2019s other interests and alliances in the region. Recent events in the northern Syrian city of Manbij, seized by the U.S.-backed Kurdish forces from Islamic State in August, highlight just how volatile the situation has become. Syrian regime and Kurdish offensives against Islamic State last month in the area effectively blocked Turkey and its Sunni proxies from heading toward Raqqa (para. 1-9). Trofimov, Y. (2017).

The Trump administration is facing internal divisions over the strategy for pushing Islamic State out of Raqqa without alienating Turkey, a vital North Atlantic Treaty Organization ally that opposes America\u2019s ongoing work with Kurdish fighters in Syria that Ankara views as terrorists. Because of Turkey\u2019s opposition, the new administration may not finalize its plans for taking Raqqa until Turkey votes April 16 on a referendum that would give President Recep Tayyip Erdogan sweeping powers, according to U.S. officials involved in the internal debate. \u201cEverything is red hot,\u201d said one senior administration official involved in the debate.\nWhile the debate in Washington continues, rival forces in Syria are jockeying for position on the battlefield in an effort to expand their influence.

The deployment marks a new escalation in the U.S. war in Syria, and puts more conventional U.S. troops in the battle. Several hundred Special Operations troops have advised local forces there for months, but the Pentagon has mostly shied away from using conventional forces in Syria. The new mission comes as the Trump administration weighs a plan to take back Raqqa, the so-called capital of the Islamic State, that also includes more Special Operations troops and attack helicopters. The force is part of the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit, which left San Diego on Navy ships in October.

Proponents of the option, which has not been previously reported, said it would provide U.S. commanders on the ground greater flexibility to quickly respond to unforeseen opportunities and challenges on the battlefield. It would also represent a step away from standard practices under President Barack Obama's administration by leaving the ultimate decision on whether to deploy some of those Kuwait-based reserve forces in Syria or Iraq to local commanders (para. 1-3). The decision on whether to create a more rapidly deplorable Kuwait-based force is part of the ongoing review of the United States' strategy to defeat Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, where around 6,000 U.S. troops are deployed, largely in advisory roles, the officials said (para. 10). RAQQA BATTLE LOOMS Trump's push against Islamic State in Syria could soon present him with an unenviable decision on whether to risk alienating NATO ally Turkey by relying on the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, which, in addition to Arabs, includes Kurdish YPG fighters (para. 14). Ankara views the YPG as the Syrian extension of the Kurdish PKK militant group, which has fought an insurgency in Turkey's southeast since 1984 and is considered a terrorist group by both the United States and the European Union. A senior Turkish official said on Tuesday that the United States had decided to go with the YPG, instead of agreeing to Ankara's call for it to instead back Syrian rebels that Turkey has trained and led against Islamic State for the past year.

A U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Dunford did not inform his Turkish counterpart of any decision about the Raqqa offensive, in remarks that appeared at odds with the Turkish account.\nIn a sign of advancing U.S. preparations for Raqqa, an American official said on Wednesday that a small group of Marines have entered Syria (para. 14-19).

Some 200,000 people remain displaced from Mosul\u2019s east and west sides since the operation to retake the city from Islamic State began in October, according to the United Nations agency that helps displaced persons, refugees and migrant workers. On its outskirts, workers are building new camps to accommodate the continued exodus. People carried newborns while men pushed old women in wheelbarrows on the road out of Mosul Monday as Iraqi forces seized another western neighborhood from the militant group, continuing their advance toward the city center. Thousands of people walking out of embattled neighborhoods were forced to cross a boulevard known as Baghdad Street, as militants likely a few hundred yards away targeted a key intersection with mortar fire. Iraq\u2019s military announced its ground offensive to drive Islamic State from west Mosul, its remaining urban stronghold in Iraq, on Feb. 26 after a weeks long pause following victory in the east. Residents who had been living under Islamic State rule for more than two years poured out to aid stations and camps. The militants forced people into urban areas for use as human shields and punished those who tried to leave, according to locals and officials. UNHCR, the U.N.\u2019s refugee agency, has 10 camps near Mosul that can still host thousands more people, said spokeswoman Caroline Gluck. Another 9,300-capacity camp is opening in the coming weeks, she added. Yet the influx of displaced residents could still strain resources.\n\u201cFinding suitable land to build camps has been our No. 1 challenge, and we raised our concerns about this months ago,\u201d she said. \u201cFor the moment, we have enough capacity.

The combined Syrian Arab-Kurdish force, now numbering more than 50,000, has moved steadily to within less than six miles of the outskirts of Raqqa in an isolation phase that is expected to be completed in the coming weeks. Even if Turkey does direct its forces south toward Raqqa, the hope is that the difficult terrain they would have to travel would prevent them from reaching there until after the offensive is well underway. Rather than a wholesale revision, the new proposal calls for increased U.S. participation, with more personnel and equipment and less-restrictive rules. As they have in support of the Iraqi military in Mosul, U.S. fixed-wing aircraft and attack helicopters would actively back the ground force. U.S. owned and operated artillery would be moved into Syria to pound the militants from afar, while more Special Operations troops would move closer to the front lines \u2014 requiring more U.S. military assets to protect them. The SDF \u2014 both Kurds and Arabs \u2014 would be supplied with weaponry along with vehicles and equipment to travel through and disarm what are expected to be extensive minefields and other improvised explosive devices along the way. Trump\u2019s executive order also directed the Pentagon to recommend changes to Obama administration restrictions on military rules of engagement that went beyond those those required by international law.

The military\u2019s favored option among several variations currently under White House review, the proposal would ease a number of restrictions on U.S. activities imposed during the Obama administration. Officials involved in the planning have proposed lifting a cap on the size of the U.S. military contingent in Syria, currently numbering about 500 Special Operations trainers and advisers to the combined Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF. While the Americans would not be directly involved in ground combat, the proposal would allow them to work closer to the front line and would delegate more decision-making authority down the military line from Washington. President Trump, who campaigned on a pledge to expand the fight against the militants in Syria, Iraq and beyond, received the plan Monday after giving the Pentagon 30 days to prepare it. But in a conflict where nothing has been as simple as anticipated, the Raqqa offensive has already sparked new alliances. In just the past two days, U.S. forces intended for the Raqqa battle have had to detour to a town in northern Syria to head off a confrontation between two American allied forces \u2014 Turkish and Syrian Kurdish fighters. There, they have found themselves effectively side by side with Russian and Syrian government forces with the same apparent objective. Approval of the Raqqa plan would effectively shut the door on Turkey\u2019s demands that Syrian Kurds, considered terrorists by Ankara, be denied U.S. equipment and kept out of the upcoming offensive. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said that arming and including the Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units, or YPG, in the operation is unacceptable and has vowed to move his own troops and Turkish-allied Syrian rebel forces toward Raqqa (para. 1-6).

Donald Trump has made defeating Islamic State one of the key goals of his presidency, and his new administration received a draft Pentagon plan on Monday to accelerate the campaign.\nRaqqa in Syria, one of Islamic State's two de facto capitals along with Mosul in Iraq, is expected to be the scene of the final battle to crush the jihadists' self-proclaimed Caliphate sometime this year, after a U.S.-backed Iraqi government assault on Mosul already under way since October. But putting together a united ground force to take Raqqa has so far proven a confounding task in Syria, where the United States, Turkey, Russia, Iran and Arab states have all backed local forces in a multi-sided civil war since 2011. All the foreign powers oppose Islamic State, but their Syrian proxies have mainly fought against one another. Turkey, with the second largest army in NATO, is adamant that Washington should switch support for the planned Raqqa offensive from the Kurdish YPG militia to Syrian rebels Turkey has trained and led against Islamic State for the past year. For the U.S. administration, nervous about whether the Turkish-backed force is large enough and sufficiently trained, the decision sets Trump's wish for quick battlefield victories against the need to maintain its strategic alliance with Turkey. Ankara views the YPG as the Syrian extension of the Kurdish PKK militant group, which has fought an insurgency in Turkey's southeast since 1984 and is considered a terrorist group by both the United States and European Union. \"Our soldiers will not be fighting together with people who shot us and killed our soldiers and are trying to kill us,\" one senior Turkish security official, briefed on recent meetings between Turkish and U.S. strategists, told Reuters (para. 1-8).

The attack on Raqqa could start within a month but hinges on support from the U.S., which would include airstrikes and intelligence sharing, the official said on condition of anonymity. The American stance on the proposal has become more positive in the latest round of talks, the official said. For President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a U.S. approval would increase his influence in a conflict that has drawn regional and global powers from Russia to Iran. More immediately, it would help undermine Kurdish aspirations to autonomous rule in northern Syria by groups Turkey considers terrorists linked to separatists at home.

The Islamic State stronghold lies about 100 kilometers (60 miles) south of the Turkish border. \u201cTurkey has two objectives here, one of them is to prevent Kurdish autonomy in northern Syria, the second one is to gain leverage in Syria so that Turkey can play a bigger role in the future of this country,\u201d Unluhisarcikli said (para. 1-7).

The class had just finished a two-week training course run by U.S. Army Special Forces soldiers and SDF trainers in the hollowed-out shell of this tiny village in northern Syria, which was pulverized during a fierce fight last year between the SDF and retreating Islamic State fighters. The militiamen \u2014 until recently students, laborers, and family men \u2014 quickly grabbed their new rifles and embraced their new job, forced on them by forces beyond their control. Several of them said they would gladly go back to their civilian lives once the fighting stopped, but that the Islamic State and Turkey were threats they couldn\u2019t ignore. For the Americans, providing weapons and basic combat skills to the young fighters is the easy part of their mission. The ethnic politics of arming local forces presents a more daunting challenge. The U.S. military maintains a light footprint in northern Syria, with small teams operating four training centers to funnel Kurdish and Arab forces into the fight for the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa, and to protect gains the Kurds have made in the north around the nearby city of Manbij. Other U.S. forces are closer to the fight in Raqqa, accompanying the SDF in their move on the city, and helping call in airstrikes on Islamic State positions. Overall there are about 500 U.S. troops in the country.\nNortheast of the training range near the city of Kobani on the Turkish border, U.S. forces have constructed a hardened landing strip for C-130 and C-17 cargo planes full of equipment for the Syrian Arab forces and to supply U.S. troops operating throughout the north. The head of U.S. Central Command, Gen. Joseph Votel, and the commander of U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria, Lt. Gen Stephen Townsend, visited the site on Friday along with a few reporters for a first-hand look. The site promises to be a key hub in the fight to retake Raqqa and in the continuing effort to build up the SDF, which is growing week by week as U.S. soldiers move them through the training program. As of now, the Arab part of the SDF \u2014 the Syrian Arab Coalition \u2014 numbers about 23,000 fighters, while the battle-hardened Kurdish contingent makes up the remaining 27,000. That imbalance is an issue in the Raqqa campaign, and in the U.S. debate whether to supply arms to the Kurds, or only to the Syrian Arabs. The Trump administration has yet to announce a decision on whether it will provide weapons to the Kurdish forces, and how it comes down the issue could shape the course of the war and Washington\u2019s relations with Ankara. One of several options on the table is increasing the number of U.S. troops in Syria, perhaps even with conventional forces that could provide more help in capturing Raqqa (para. 1-10). McLeary, P.

The U.S.\u2019s main partners in Syria, the SDF and Turkey, are competing to lead the next phase of operations to seize ar-Raqqah City and thereby solidify their influence over post-ISIS governance. The SDF are currently the U.S. partner force best positioned to seize the city and have begun establishing governance structures comprised of local allied Arab leaders. Turkey\u2019s alternative proposals for a Turkish-approved force to seize ar-Raqqah City risk an armed conflict with the SDF or pro-regime forces as well as the empowerment of Salafi-Jihadi group Ahrar al-Sham. The U.S. must work with its allies to both prevent an armed conflict between Turkey and the SDF that would detract from current anti-ISIS operations and while simultaneously setting conditions to ensure a representative governance structure for post-ISIS ar-Raqqah City. The Syrian Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have seized the majority of ISIS-held territory in the eastern countryside of ar-Raqqah in ongoing efforts to isolate the city. The SDF launched the third phase of Operation Euphrates Wrath on February 4 with the stated objective of seizing the eastern countryside of ar-Raqqah City. The SDF attacked south towards ar-Raqqah City along two axes from SDF-held territory east of the town of Ayn Issa, reportedly seizing 98 villages and hamlets northeast of ar-Raqqah City by February 12. The SDF connected these two axes on February 11 and was approximately 5 km northeast of ar-Raqqah City as of February 17. The SDF subsequently announced the second stage of phase three on February 17 and launched two axes of attack in a pincer movement to seize the Raqqa-Hasakah highway and encircle ISIS-held territory in Northern Deir ez Zour Province. The SDF simultaneously advanced south from newly seized territory on the Raqqah-Hasakah highway and seized the village of Judaydat Khabour on February 21, thereby weakening ISIS\u2019s ability to resupply ar-Raqqah City. The SDF are now positioned to complete the isolation of ar-Raqqah City and subsequently transition to the next phase of seizing the city (para. 1-2). Ramage, T. (2017).

The objective of the coming U.S.-backed offensive is the city of Raqqa, Islamic State's de facto capital, which U.S. officials think the hard-line group has been using as a hub to hatch plots against the West. Despite months of U.S. efforts to allay Turkish concerns, Ankara is insisting the offensive be carried out by local Arab fighters with support from Turkish troops, as opposed to the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, which in addition to Arabs includes Kurdish fighters who Turkey considers a threat. As Ankara warns of a major rupture in ties if its concerns are ignored, U.S. and Turkish military officials have been reviewing Turkish proposals for the Raqqa campaign in recent days, one U.S. \nofficial said. No decision has been reached, officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.\nA senior Turkish official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, estimated that as many as 10,000 fighters could be made available for the Raqqa campaign, in addition to Turkish and any U.S. forces backing them. U.S. officials, however, have questioned whether the Turkish-backed forces are up to the job, at least anytime soon, noting the difficulty Turkish-backed rebels had this week driving Islamic State from the town of al-Bab, which is a significantly smaller and easier target than Raqqa. In a reminder of the threat, even after al Bab was seized on Thursday, an Islamic State car bomb killed more than 50 people in a nearby Syrian village on Friday. It is also unclear how Turkish forces would get to Raqqa, perhaps by carving a path through Syrian-government-held or Kurdish-held territory. A U.S. intelligence official also noted that Turkey might want to clear the town of Manbij of Kurds before going to Raqqa. Turkish-backed forces still may need to be trained and, potentially, supplemented by a far larger number of American troops than the 500 special operations forces in Syria now - all factors that could slow and complicate the Raqqa campaign. \"To the extent that President Trump has expressed a desire to take Raqqa as quickly and forcibly as possible, the only force that's poised to do that is the SDF,\" said Blaise Misztal, the director of the national security program at the Bipartisan Policy Center (para. 1-10).

Al-Bab was ISIS' last significant holdout between the northern countryside of Aleppo and Raqqa, the group's de facto capital. Held by ISIS since 2013, al-Bab was recaptured after more than two months of fighting. The attack in Sousian village, a few miles north of the town, killed between 53 and 60 people, according to activist groups Aleppo Media Center and the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The groups said ISIS militants were believed to be behind the attack. Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency reported that 60 people were killed and at least 100 others wounded, adding that the car bomb targeted a security building for the Free Syrian Army, an association of rebel groups fighting ISIS. Dozens of injured Syrians are being treated at a hospital across the border in the Turkish town of Kilis, Anadolu said. Thirty-three of those killed in the blast have been identified, said Barry Abdullatif, founder of media activist group al-Bab City Coordination.

Rebel officials said that no official explanation had been given for the move this month following the jihadist assault, though several said they believed the main objective was to prevent arms and cash falling into Islamist militant hands. But they said they expected the aid freeze to be temporary. The halt in assistance, which has included salaries, training, ammunition and in some cases guided anti-tank missiles, is a response to jihadist attacks and has nothing to do with U.S. President Donald Trump replacing Barack Obama in January, two U.S. officials familiar with the CIA-led program said. The freeze reflects the troubles facing Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebels in the almost six-year-old revolt against Assad, who now appears militarily unassailable in his core western region largely thanks to direct intervention on his side by Russia and Iran. \"The reality is that you have changes in the area, and these changes inevitably have repercussions,\" said an official with one of the affected FSA rebel groups. He said no military assistance could \"enter at present until matters are organized. There is a new arrangement but nothing has crystallized yet\". The support funneled to vetted FSA factions has included contributions from Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia - states that have opposed Assad. It is one of several foreign aid channels to rebels. Others still function. The CIA declined comment on the reported freeze in support. A Qatari official said his government had nothing to say on the matter. Turkish officials said only they could not discuss \"operational details\". There was no word from Saudi Arabia. Reuters confirmed the freeze with officials from five of the FSA groups that have been recipients of financial and military support from the so-called \"MOM operations room\". It was also confirmed by two other senior FSA figures briefed on the matter. \nThey spoke on condition of anonymity given the covert nature of the CIA-backed program and the sensitivity of the subject. Several rebels believed the aid halt was temporary, with new arrangements expected, but there was no clarity yet. Confirming the freeze, two senior FSA sources said donor states were aiming to send the aid to one, unified fighting force - a coherence that has eluded rebels throughout Syria's civil war. One of the FSA officials said he did not expect the rebels to be abandoned as they represent the best hope for blocking a further expansion of Sunni jihadist influence in Syria, and to fight back against the growing role of Iran there (para. 1-11).

The US considers the only effective rebel fighting force that could be used against Raqqa are the Kurds, and for the US and Turkey to attack Raqqa (or support Sunni fighters against Raqqa ) requires the cooperation of the Kurds, which Turkey (with its historical animosity towards the Kurds) is not willing to agree to.

It is finding the next phase -- brokering an end to the fighting -- a tougher proposition. A round of Syria peace talks sponsored by Russia ended on Thursday with no joint communique, usually the minimum outcome of any diplomatic negotiation, and saw opposing Syrian groups exchanging angry tirades at each other and the brokers. With no concrete progress to report, media representatives at the talks venue in ex-Soviet Kazakhstan, were so hungry for a scrap of news that at one point a crowd formed around an Arabic speaker who they thought was a participant in the talks. He turned out to be another journalist.\nWestern diplomats, who say Russian President Vladimir Putin's campaign of air strikes has worsened the conflict, have, in private, reacted to Russia's tribulations as a peacemaker with variations on the phrase: \"We told you so.\" Russia proposed a series of negotiations in the Kazakh capital Astana late last year with the expectation that, as the predominant outside power in Syria following its military intervention, it could break a deadlock that had defied the repeated efforts of the big Western powers and U.N. mediators. Moscow's peace drive started hopefully, with the first Astana meeting in January. The Syrian rebels and government came together for the first time in 9 months, and agreement was reached to consolidate a shaky ceasefire. But by the second round this week, things had gone downhill. The Syrian rebels debated until the eleventh hour about whether to attend at all, finally sending a smaller delegation which arrived in the Kazakh capital a day late. Russia's efforts were hampered by the deep enmity between the rival Syrian sides, but also by contradictions among its co-sponsors. One of them, Turkey, is fiercely opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Russia and the third co-sponsor, Iran, are Assad's staunchest allies. Syrian government negotiator Bashar Jaafari said on Thursday that peace talks in Astana had not produced a communique because of the \"irresponsible\" late arrival of rebel participants and their Turkish backers which delayed the joint session by a day. He also criticized the rebels and Turkey for downgrading their delegations from the previous meeting.\n\"Turkey cannot ignite the fire and at the same time act as a firefighter,\" he told a briefing after the talks (para 1-11).

Trump described the ex-general, who rights groups criticize as authoritarian and repressive, as a \"fantastic guy\".\nSisi, the first foreign leader to congratulate Trump on his election victory, returned the favor last month after the newly inaugurated president barred citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States.\nEgypt, not on the list, refrained from speaking out against the ban on behalf of Muslim countries that often look to it for leadership. That silence spoke volumes about the changing tone of its relationship with the United States.\nFor Trump, Sisi appeals as an uncompromising leader who came to power by overthrowing the Muslim Brotherhood and is fighting Islamic State in northern Sinai and on his border with Libya.\nFor Sisi, Trump appeals as a U.S. leader who unlike Barack Obama is not interested in berating an old ally on human rights.\n\"The rhetoric alone of this Trump administration is much more forward leaning in its support towards Sisi than Obama,\" said one U.S. official, who declined to be named. \"I expect it to be a much closer relationship.\"\nEgypt is one of Washington's closest Middle East allies, and U.S. military aid has long cemented its historic 1979 peace deal with Israel.

The loyalists are simply pulled in too many directions to achieve a decisive victory.

There was a terrorist assault on nightclub in Istanbul. 29 people were killed. Club is known to be frequented by Westerners and let assume ISIS either inspired or directed the assault. ISIS claimed responsbility. WIth a coup, and assasination, an airport bombing and numerous terror attacks along the border there have been 20 such incidents-mass casualty of 5 or more there have been over 21 in last 2 years all or most were claimed by Erdogan to be Kurd or ISIS inspired. Every attack on the border or outside Diyankibur province (where a PKK war is  ongoing with Erdogan) has been inspired. \nI am inclined to believe that only assualts in DIiyankbir provoice where a NATO air base is located were Kurd related,.\nWe do not know whether the assasination of the Russian ambassador or other attacks, (other than Istnabul airprot were ISIS\nThe assasination and coup and repression  and purge of over 25,000 miltiary, police, media, teachers allged Gulenists have nothing to do with ISIS. 2.) Even before the coup after Istanbul and all these Turk  terror attacks which Erdogan attributes to ISIS,\nNot once  in 5 years has Erdogan sent the Turk army into Syria or in the last 3 year sent his army, the 2d largest NATO against Assad or ISIS. 3. The only deployment of Turkish troops is part of \"Euphrates Shield\" which is an  Erdogan operation with one purpose, clean the Turk border of the YPG, the Kurds. The YPG still controls the entire Turk border except for the area adjacent to Euphrates.Seen very very few Turk troop or tanks on film other than just crossing border, The Turk FSA is its proxy and comprises hundreds, at most, not thousands of trained and armed troops in combat in \nAl-Bab. The FSA did engage ISIS in one border village near river. 4. Al Bab is only 17 kilometers from Aleppo, not Raqqa and the battle agaisnt ISIS at Al-Bab has been  continuing since coalition forces entered Mosul. 5 Cease fire is like the last 28, will not last. Not a cease fire in place with partition-like KIssinger pulled in Sinai after Yom Kippur War in 1970  with the Egyptian 3d army was enveloped by the IDF. This is another cease fire that is not a cease fire as \"terrorists\" are excluded and ISIS and the Nusra front and FSA control overlaps east of Syria.  FIghting cotinues today all over Syria between Assad and the Sunni opposition in Idlib, in Al-Bab and in and around Aleppo. Just seems like a cease-fire as Putin has Russia and Assad airforce grounded for \"cease fire\" and \"peace talks\" 6.) Such talks in Astana wll not succeed as Iran and Assad will never agree to Assad leaving in a \"couple years\" or any partition of Syria. Putin can  and did  just did keep  Assad afloat, Assad was near defeat,now he is on brink of total victory.  Due to Russia. But Russia cannot force Assad out, ever without Iran approval not forthcomng, 7. Russia, Turkey. Assad, Iran all  had the sufficient resources to capture Raqqa 2 years ago. None have. None will. All expect and need US and YPG to do it. All the heavy lifting against Raqqa will be by US and YPG not FSA ( remember our FSA of 50 or was it 5), not Putin or Assad, Assad cannot even take back Palmyra. Russia  must redeploy its forces back to Russia. Except for the naval base at Tarsus and a couple of squadrons at Latakia, Putin cannot afford the contiuing financial losses, the warcan not remain popular for long  in Russia and even the UN  Security Council is  just 2 vote short of sanctIoning Putin  and Assad for war crimes. But for PRC and veto\nwould have occurred. Putin economy lost 1/3 of  net asset value due to  oil prices below 90 and sanctions.                 7. Erdogan is not 1 week 40 days, or 6 months away from Raqqa. Erdogan and FSA could not move on Raqqa now, and Erdogan will never use his army against ISIS. Erdogan will only use his army against YPG on border  \nTurks will not, FSA  cannot.\n8.) US forces are the only way Raqqa can be taken in 6 months.\n9.) Mosul attack began in mid-October with Al_Abadi promising victory by 1-1-17. Abadi admitted \"victory\" in Mosul will come in 3 more months. \n10.) There is no US coalition capable of taking Raqqa in 6 months.\nthose who believe Erdogan will change course and combat any force other YPG and the symbolic shamnbolic \nongoing  Al-bab op with FSA Fantasies: from WSJ \n\"Turkish forces are now closing in on the extremists\u2019 stronghold of al-Bab in Aleppo province and Turkish jets and artillery pounded Islamic State targets on Monday, the military said\"\n( So WSJ just reports what Erdogan controlled Media and Anatolia news service report) disgraceful- might as well base a factual story on Putin or Assad claims\" Both are \"liars and thugs\" Erdogan is same.

Yet that will pose a significant risk in itself, raising the possibility of inflaming the country's deeply rooted sectarian tensions. This danger has alarmed several U.S. partners, including the United Kingdom, and British Defense Secretary Michael Fallon has warned that Raqqa's Arab population may not welcome a Kurdish invasion\"\n\"The ally that could most impede Washington's plans, however, is Turkey. Ankara not only shares London's concerns of rivalries emerging between Arabs and Kurds, but it also holds great hostility toward the Kurdish YPG. Turkey, anxious to avoid relying on or strengthening the Kurds, has instead proposed an alternative: Postpone the Raqqa operation until the coalition gains enough Arab fighters to replace the YPG in the offensive. Turkey has even begun to train Arab fighters on its own side of the Syrian border, and it has promised to actively participate in the operation if the Kurds are excluded from it.\"\nand\n\"But Ankara's plan would not be put into practice fast enough for Washington's liking. The United States wants to start the Raqqa operation immediately, and since the Syrian Democratic Forces are the only group ready to do so, the United States appears to be intent on placing the offensive on their shoulders. Turkey's opposition could be problematic, though. Syria's Turkish-backed rebels are already clashing with Kurdish YPG units in northern Aleppo; further conflict, or perhaps a rebel push toward Manbij, could easily distract the Kurds from the Raqqa operation down the road\"\nMy thesis is that until Erdogan moves, the US and coalition offensive against Raqqa is on hold.\nThe Turkish army is NATO's second largest but as noted in my last forecast citing Anatolia News; The Turks and their FSA allies are still battling for Mambij.\n  A change of administration may  change this forecast. But as long as US waits on Erdogan, and its been several years, no significant progress will be made.\n Counter-intuitively one can argue that further YPG moves on Raqqa could be a powerful incentive for Erdogan to act on Raqqa. But to date such action is likely to involve targeting Kurds and forestalling siege of city.\n Moving Erdogan  or ignoring Erdogan  are options but impossible to assess now.\nWhen will the operation has begin? Not until forces in place. \n Mosul operation began in October. so for the moment Raqqa's days are numbered but there is no present expiration date for ISIS rule of Raqqa.

(At some point either the Kurds get offered an autonomous area in Syria or Assad, Iran or Turkey will seek to crush them in Syria)   "], [1034, "2016-12-16T06:55:55Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [23262, "2016-12-16T06:35:27Z", [0.03, 0.66, 0.31], ""], [368, "2016-12-15T21:21:29Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [691, "2016-12-15T19:57:18Z", [0.0, 0.56, 0.44], ""], [28380, "2016-12-15T16:06:25Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.85], ""], [24474, "2016-12-15T15:49:46Z", [0.0, 0.16, 0.84], "Analysis of battle for Mosul, with lessons for how ISIS may fight in Raqqa: http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-skeptics/the-battle-mosul-doomed-18740"], [14777, "2016-12-15T14:03:09Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.9], ""], [11080, "2016-12-15T10:52:43Z", [0.0, 0.26, 0.74], ""], [11080, "2016-12-15T10:52:06Z", [0.0, 0.32, 0.68], ""], [31471, "2016-12-15T10:03:04Z", [0.0, 0.17, 0.83], ""], [1034, "2016-12-15T08:13:23Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "Gibbons-Neff (2016) Dec 14, states that: The Islamic State\u2019s conquest of Palmyra appears to have netted the group a trove of weaponry, armor, ammunition and equipment that risks fueling a surge of gains by the militants in Syria at a time when attention has been diverted on the battle unfolding in Aleppo.\nPalmyra\u2019s fall comes less than a year after Syrian government forces, along with Iranian-backed militias and Russian special operations troops, retook the city from the Islamic State. The group seized the city in 2014, partially destroying a number of its world-renowned archaeological sites.\nThe recent militant offensive drove Syrian government troops almost completely from the city on Sunday. The Islamic State-linked news agency Amaq later posted images of Syrian and Russian equipment left behind by the retreating troops. One video shows the remains of a Russian forward operating base that had been established after the city was first retaken in March and was used to help with demining efforts there (para. 1-3).\nImages posted online Tuesday by the group also depicts fighters seizing what looks like a Syrian fire base to the west of the city. An independent researcher who runs a website that documents the Syrian conflict, puts the base just north of the government-held Tiyas air base. Images taken by the Islamic State show abandoned artillery pieces, machine guns and, in the background of one of the photos, the outline of what looks like an S-125 surface-to-air missile system and its associated targeting and tracking radar (para. 7). The S-125, known as a SA-3 to NATO countries, is a Soviet-era weapon that can hit targets flying at approximately 60,000 feet, and has a maximum effective range of 17 miles, according to U.S. military documents. It can be configured to fire two or four missiles from its rail system. If properly used, it could pose a threat to any aircraft flying in the area; however, systems such as the S-125 are complicated to use and are easily seen and targeted from the air (para. 7- 8).

Over the course of 2016, IS (also known as Daesh) has suffered a string of defeats in Syria, Iraq, and Libya, losing control of several towns and cities it had captured in the past two years.\nThe conquest of Palmyra, despite heavy bombing from the Russian forces, is a reminder of the threat the militant group continues to present despite numerous attacks and setbacks.\nIsis still holds control over large parts of northern Syria, including Raqqa, the Syrian de-facto capital, and is holding on to the city of Mosul, where the coalition forces, led by the Iraqi army, have failed to make significant gains ever since entering the eastern part of the city (para. 1-3).

Gen. Stephen Townsend told reporters there are still an estimated 3,000-5,000 IS fighters still defending Mosul.\nU.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter made an unannounced visit Sunday to an Iraqi air base where several hundred U.S. troops are helping Iraqi forces stage for their offensive to retake Mosul from IS (para. 1-3).\nIn Bahrain on Saturday, Carter announced he is sending another 200 troops to Syria to train and advise local fighters combatting IS.

The assault, which follows the capture of the neighboring Zahraa and Tahrir districts, is being led by the Counter Terrorism Service (CTS), a branch of the Iraqi special forces.\nMeanwhile, the Iraqi Army's 16th division arrived in the eastern part of Mosul city to compensate for heavy losses, primarily due to ISIS suicide bombings. These reinforcements will join the CTS, and elements of the 9th Armored Division, amid an ongoing push to reach the heart of Mosul.\nOn the southern axis, the Iraqi Armed Forces seized control of Qaryat Kahar\u012bz village which now can be used as a launching pad to enter Mosul's southern neighborhoods.\nMeanwhile, the Islamic State launched a major counter-offensive west of Qayyarah in a bid to capture its airfield and cut off the Iraqi Army's supply line to Mosul. Although initially successful, capturing 6 villages, the Iraqi Army swiftly responded and recaptured all lost sites, leaving the assault thwarted, and resulting in the death and arrest of 51 fighters.\nAn Iraqi military source informs Al-Masdar News that at least 2800 ISIS fighters have been killed or captured since the campaign to liberate Mosul, dubbed operation \"We Are Coming, Nineveh\", began on October 16th.\nOn the other hand, ISIS' Amaq Agency claims 2671 Iraqi and Kurdish troops have been killed during the offensive while 124 VBIED's (suicide trucks) have struck anti-ISIS forces.\nAcross the border, in Syria, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have advanced to within 25 kilometers of another ISIS stronghold, none other than Raqqa, the de facto Islamic State capital (para. 1-7).

The U.S.-backed Syria Democratic Forces, which include Kurdish, Arab and Turkmen fighters, have driven IS from large swaths of territory, but Turkey views the Syrian Kurds who dominate the group as an extension of the Kurdish insurgency raging in its southeast.\nTurkey has sent its own forces across the border to back Syrian opposition fighters, and has suggested they lead the offensive to retake Raqqa. The Turkey-backed forces, now pushing toward the IS stronghold of al-Bab, have clashed with IS as well as the SDF. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Turkey-backed opposition fighters captured six villages near al-Bab on Tuesday and are now about 4 miles (7 kilometers) from the town.\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told reporters that the U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph Dunford, told Turkish officials during a recent visit that Kurdish-led forces would only have a role in encircling Raqqa and would not enter the city. \u201cWe hope that this will be the case and we expect that our partners keep their promises,\u201d Cavusoglu said. He said \u201clocal\u201d fighters aided by Turkish special forces should drive IS out of Raqqa, and suggested that residents of the mainly Sunni Arab city might not welcome Kurdish forces (para. 1-7).

Why is Raqqa likely to be tougher than Mosul? In some respects, Raqqa could be considered a far easier military objective. It is much smaller than Mosul, with far fewer civilians at risk of being made homeless, or caught in the crossfire of a protracted urban battle.\nThe biggest challenge is finding troops to bring the fight on the ground against ISIS.\nIraq, despite its long history of conflict, is far more stable than Syria. There is an Iraqi central government with security forces that largely cooperate with the semi-autonomous Iraqi Kurdistan regional government against their common ISIS enemy. Syria, however, is a patchwork of multiple conflicts being simultaneously fought between a dizzying array of armed groups. Each faction seems to enjoy the support of rival foreign patrons.\nWhile Washington says its main objective is to eliminate ISIS in Syria, the Syrian government and Syrian rebels are far more busy trying to eliminate each other Para. 1-8).

Another said some of the needed Arab forces were still in training. Like seven other officials interviewed for this report, they requested anonymity to discuss the issue. U.S. Marine General Joseph Dunford, the top U.S. military officer, played down the idea that seizing Raqqa would be quick or easy, saying the first job was sealing off the city. \"We always advertised that the isolation phase is going to take months,\" Dunford was quoted as saying on Sunday by a U.S. defense department reporter traveling with him in Turkey. Dunford's visit to Ankara came as the Obama administration is enmeshed in a delicate balancing act between NATO ally Turkey and rival Syrian Kurdish forces trained and equipped by the United States. The U.S. plan for Raqqa calls for an assault force of thousands of fighters from the Kurdish Peoples Defense Units, known as the YPG, and Arabs whose job it would be to take and hold the city itself, U.S. officials said. However, U.S. special operations forces in northern Syria have yet to recruit enough Arabs to take and hold the Arab-dominated city, they said. Some U.S. officials and experts doubt that the United States will be able to soon field an Arab force large and strong to defeat thousands of Islamic State militants who have had months to prepare a final stand. They pointed out that some 25,000 Iraqi troops, militiamen and Kurdish peshmerga fighters are involved in the offensive to wrest Mosul from an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 militants. \"Raqqa is every bit as infested as Mosul, perhaps even more so,\" said Thomas Lynch, a National Defense University fellow and retired Army officer. \"But there is an enormous investment by this administration in terms of going after Raqqa before it leaves office.\"(para. 4-11).

I can't see the US and other outsiders wanting to stir up more trouble by invading Syria to capture Raqqa (which would be the case if not invited by Assad)  and I can't see Assad and the US making a deal to jointly capture Raqqa while war crimes are being committed in Aleppo.  So while Raqqa might be bombed I don't see it being captured until after Aleppo has fallen, and even then I would expect a delay before Assad moved to Raqqa.

Top U.S. officials have met in recent weeks with members of the anti-Islamic State coalition, including Turkey, Kurdish leaders in Syria and the U.K., trying to hammer out an agreement to launch an offensive soon on the city of Raqqa. Such an operation would aim to isolate the extremists in the Syrian city, limit their ability to reinforce its satellite strongholds across Iraq and Syria and seal off escape routes, as the flight of fighters is both a concern for the region and a terrorist threat to Europe. The plan is complicated by the limited American military role on the ground in Syria, where a few dozen Special Operation Forces work with Turkey and its allies, supported by U.S. and coalition airstrikes. Iraqi coalition forces launched an offensive against Islamic State in Mosul on Monday. Government troops and some 5,000 Kurdish Peshmerga forces advanced toward the outskirts of Iraq's second-largest city.\nThat leaves the U.S. to rely on a rancorous alliance that is challenged by distrust between Turkey and the Kurds and between Kurdish fighters and Arab Sunni forces. The U.S. is trying to deliver a crippling blow to Islamic State before President Barack Obama leaves office in January.\"    Assad and Russia are presently occupied with Aleppo and neither seems to have any interests or forces that require rapid reduction of Raqqa.

Photo: EPA.\nBy DION NISSENBAUM in Istanbul and  CAROL E. LEE in Ankara\nUpdated Aug. 24, 2016 6:12 a.m. ET\n20 COMMENTS\nTurkish and American military forces launched a major offensive in northwestern Syria against Islamic State militants early Wednesday as they try to sever the extremist group\u2019s vital supply routes and deter Kurdish fighters from seizing a key border town, according to officials from both countries. Turkish special forces, aided by American military advisers, U.S. drones and Turkish artillery units, moved into northern Syria before dawn as part of the coordinated campaign to push Islamic State out of a strategic town on the Euphrates River, officials said. Turkish jets bombed Islamic State forces inside Syria, according to Turkey\u2019s state-run Anadolu news agency, in what are believed to be the first airstrikes by Turkey inside Syria since November, when Turkish pilots shot down a Russian warplane that briefly strayed into Turkish airspace. Turkish tanks also moved into Syria as the offensive gathered momentum early Wednesday, the news agency said. Meanwhile, hundreds of Turkish-backed Syrian rebels were massed at the border, poised to retake Jarabulus, one of Islamic State\u2019s last remaining gateways used by the group to ferry reinforcements and supplies from Turkey into its de facto capital in Raqqa. Turkish artillery units had been pounding Islamic State forces holding the Syrian town for two days as the military\u2014shaken by last month\u2019s thwarted coup attempt\u2014looks to re-establish its role as a key player in the fight on its doorstep. U.S. drones based at Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey are carrying out surveillance missions over Jarabulus, and American special operations forces are working with Turkish military officers on the Turkish side of the border to plan the offensive, officials said. \"\n\nHere is Strafors sit reps for this\n\"Appears as though the battle for the Syrian city of Jarabulus, one of the last strongholds of the Islamic State, will soon begin. Some 1,500 rebels fighting for the Free Syrian Army have reportedly been deployed to the Turkish district of Karkamis, which lies directly across the border from Jarabulus. The Turkish government is evacuating the city, with police calling on residents to leave the area in light of recent mortar fire. Turkey has said it will support the rebels' operation. To that end, the military has intensified its artillery fire into Syria over the past 24 hours, striking Islamic State and Kurdish People's Protection Unit targets as more tanks and armored vehicles make their way to Karkamis. Still, Ankara is not expected to send many \u2014 if any \u2014 ground forces across the border. Meanwhile, Russian aircraft are said to have launched airstrikes on Jarabulus, but it is unclear how closely, if at all, these strikes were coordinated with the government in Ankara. If the rebels wrest control of Jarabulus from the Islamic State, they will be able to put some distance between the jihadist group and Turkey. And as proxies for Turkey, which is anxious as ever to halt Kurdish expansion, they also hope to prevent the Syrian Democratic Forces, a militia composed primarily of Syrian Kurds, from pushing too far west after gaining control of several strategic towns in the north already.  Aug. 22: Rebels Prepare To Retake Jarabulus \"A group of Syrian rebels is preparing to launch an attack on one of the last major towns controlled by the Islamic State along the Syria-Turkey border. Members of the Free Syrian Army and various other militias have massed in Turkey ahead of the assault on Jarabulus, which is scheduled to begin sometime within the next few days. The operation's purpose is twofold: By recapturing Jarabulus, the Free Syrian Army hopes to not only push the Islamic State from the Turkish border but also to limit the Syrian Democratic Forces from extending their reach to the west. Earlier this month the Kurdish-dominated group seized the city of Manbij, just 32 kilometers (20 miles) south of Jarabulus, and Kurdish militias elsewhere in Syria have gained control of several strategic towns in the northern Aleppo province \u2014 a development with which Turkey, the Free Syrian Army's backer, is not pleased. In fact, Turkey has already conducted several airstrikes and has fired rounds of artillery shelling in and around Jarabulus\"\n\"https://www.stratfor.com/analysis/iraq-syria-battlespace- and Wall Street Journal indicates today that Assad and US backed Kurds and Sunnis are in \na \"cease fire\" Page A-7 WSJ August 24  and is Turkey actually fighting to assist YPG, no way."], [28505, "2016-08-24T07:25:21Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "ISiS will source and  spend their tesources in a more defendable region elsewhere"], [26759, "2016-08-23T21:58:27Z", [0.13, 0.61, 0.26], ""], [691, "2016-08-23T19:26:51Z", [0.01, 0.46, 0.53], ""], [368, "2016-08-23T16:49:25Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [2965, "2016-08-23T14:18:46Z", [0.0, 0.28, 0.72], "http://www.wsj.com/articles/turkey-strikes-islamic-state-targets-after-wedding-bombing-1471948983\nGAZIANTEP, Turkey\u2014Turkey shelled Islamic State-held territory across the border in Syria on Tuesday, keeping up a retaliation campaign as the country mourned a weekend bombing that ripped through a wedding celebration and killed 54 people.

Assad and allies seem to see the continued existence of ISIL as a useful fig leaf to cover what they are doing in the civil war. Their thinking seems to be that as long as ISIL commits atrocities they (Assad & co) have an excuse to also commit, slightly less heinous atrocities, on anyone who does not support Assad. Its clear that Assad & co have put a lot more effort into trying to capture Aleppo than they have in trying to capture Raqqa. I would not expect Assad to  attack Raqqa until the non-ISIL rebels have been completely defeated.  Other non-ISIL forces in Syria include the Kurds. Like many of actors in this theatre the Kurds have unique allies and enemies. Their enemies include the Turks, ISIL and Assad, their friends and allies include the USA and Russia.  Attacking Raqqa would seem to be of little advantage to the Kurds. The Kurds do not want territory that has not got Kurds living in it and that does not further their aim of carving out a Kurdish majority autonomous statelet.  It makes more sence for the Kurds to aim to control a contiguous territory of Sysria from the northern border with  Turkey running from Kurdish Iraq as far west as their are Kurds.  They are likely to come into conflict with ISIL as ISIL attempt to keep supply routes from Raqqa to Turkey open. But I don't see the Kurds attacking Raqqa unless as part of s general settlement of the Syrian civil war.\nThe Iranians also have or control forces in Syria. Although they support Assad they do not necessarily have the same objectives. The Iranians might be more interested in attacking Raqqa, but the problem might be that to do so they would be supporting on the ground, the air war that the USA and the West have been conducting against ISIL.\nOther non-ISIL sunni Syrians are hard pressed around Aleppo and in no state to attack Raqqa. \nThe US and the West have multiple political issues to deal with, which I think will mean that no overwhelming force will be aimed at Raqqa until after Mosul has been recaptured and until after the next US President takes office in January 2017, even if the new President takes the decision to try and capture Raqqa it would take more than 5 months to do so. \nhttp://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/raqqa-will-not-fall-until-arab-tribes-fight-the-islamic-state"], [691, "2016-08-08T20:15:46Z", [0.02, 0.5, 0.48], ""], [368, "2016-08-08T17:34:06Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [241, "2016-08-08T16:44:16Z", [0.4, 0.55, 0.05], ""], [241, "2016-08-08T16:43:26Z", [0.35, 0.6, 0.05], ""], [28154, "2016-08-08T16:17:59Z", [0.15, 0.8, 0.05], ""], [23234, "2016-08-08T10:13:35Z", [0.09, 0.83, 0.08], ""], [14414, "2016-08-08T07:52:05Z", [0.0, 0.2, 0.8], ""], [1669, "2016-08-07T21:19:21Z", [0.05, 0.2, 0.75], ""], [691, "2016-08-07T17:46:35Z", [0.02, 0.5, 0.48], ""], [28129, "2016-08-07T15:37:50Z", [0.65, 0.35, 0.0], ""], [25641, "2016-08-07T14:52:54Z", [0.04, 0.27, 0.69], ""], [1646, "2016-08-07T14:21:03Z", [0.01, 0.35, 0.64], ""], [15621, "2016-08-07T13:59:23Z", [0.15, 0.45, 0.4], "See comments on Mosul, May be attempt to take both at same time "], [241, "2016-08-07T09:36:54Z", [0.3, 0.6, 0.1], ""], [27729, "2016-08-07T08:44:52Z", [0.06, 0.36, 0.58], ""], [1269, "2016-08-07T01:02:30Z", [0.02, 0.03, 0.95], ""], [368, "2016-08-06T19:18:02Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [28037, "2016-08-05T21:28:38Z", [0.1, 0.6, 0.3], ""], [15548, "2016-08-05T19:15:32Z", [0.0, 0.23, 0.77], ""], [368, "2016-08-05T18:14:35Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [691, "2016-08-05T17:43:32Z", [0.02, 0.5, 0.48], ""], [241, "2016-08-05T14:00:37Z", [0.2, 0.7, 0.1], ""], [241, "2016-08-05T13:47:37Z", [0.3, 0.6, 0.1], ""], [1708, "2016-08-05T11:22:54Z", [0.0, 0.35, 0.65], ""], [10759, "2016-08-05T10:14:17Z", [0.18, 0.4, 0.42], ""], [4634, "2016-08-05T10:13:45Z", [0.18, 0.4, 0.42], ""], [25875, "2016-08-04T20:50:25Z", [0.15, 0.31, 0.54], ""], [368, "2016-08-04T19:45:01Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [691, "2016-08-04T18:58:55Z", [0.02, 0.5, 0.48], ""], [241, "2016-08-04T13:56:17Z", [0.33, 0.57, 0.1], ""], [12302, "2016-08-04T12:14:34Z", [0.01, 0.45, 0.54], ""], [241, "2016-08-04T11:01:51Z", [0.35, 0.5, 0.15], ""], [9755, "2016-08-03T21:45:52Z", [0.0, 0.7, 0.3], ""], [691, "2016-08-03T19:15:57Z", [0.02, 0.5, 0.48], ""], [368, "2016-08-03T19:04:10Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [28032, "2016-08-03T14:58:29Z", [0.19, 0.28, 0.53], ""], [13320, "2016-08-03T14:01:58Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [691, "2016-08-02T20:51:41Z", [0.02, 0.5, 0.48], ""], [24474, "2016-08-02T20:50:43Z", [0.08, 0.71, 0.21], ""], [368, "2016-08-02T18:13:17Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [241, "2016-08-02T16:56:59Z", [0.4, 0.45, 0.15], ""], [241, "2016-08-02T14:25:25Z", [0.15, 0.55, 0.3], ""], [15196, "2016-08-02T07:00:07Z", [0.0, 0.2, 0.8], ""], [1056, "2016-08-02T03:02:46Z", [0.1, 0.1, 0.8], "The Kurds are interested in securing access to their western cantons, and will not waste resources on Raqqa.

In the meantime, Pres. Erdogan finds himself in a truly uncomfortable spot following the Istanbul airport attack. Having looked the other way-- towards the Kurds-- while thousands of wannabe jihadis crossed the Syrian frontier, he effectively entered into a co-dependent relationship with Islamic State. That relationship has started to fray. Adding to his dyspepsia, the U.S. and Russia have differing preferred outcomes in Syria, a situation unlikely to be resolved before, or by the results of, the U.S. presidential election. Creeping chaos is not something he can weather indefinitely. But as a NATO member, his military options are constrained. The Obama administration has made it clear by word and deed that US boots will not be on the ground in Syria (with the exception of special forces). It's certainly possible that domestic political pressure to retaliate could build to the breaking point in the absence of coalition help, but that would put Turkey at the center, not just the front line, of the Syrian civil war until its resolution. His actions until now suggest that Pres. Erdogan has no such appetites.
