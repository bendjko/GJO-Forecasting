Trippi [Joe Trippi, a Democratic strategist for Espy who also worked on Jones\u2019s campaign]  said he believes the margin between the two candidates is of around 3 to 5 points.\n. . .\nPresident Trump is set to hold a couple of rallies on the eve of the runoff, visiting a state he won by 18 points in 2016 and one where he has an approval rating of 59 percent,. . . \n. . . \n\u201cEspy has about a 150,000-vote deficit.\n. . . Strategists say that for Espy to pull off an upset \u2014 and become the state\u2019s first black senator since Reconstruction\u2014 he would need to win at least 90 percent of non-white voters, while garnering around 25 percent of white voters.  African Americans make up about 38 percent of Mississippi\u2019s population and exit polling from CNN showed that black voters made up 33 percent of the electorate in the Nov. 6 election, with the overwhelming majority voting for Espy. Meanwhile, Hyde-Smith won 60 percent of white voters. To gin up enthusiasm, Espy has gotten some star power on the campaign trail from Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), two black lawmakers and potential presidential contenders.  Both sides are also spending heavily in the race, with national groups spending more than $3.6 million. The National Republican Senatorial Committee and GOP super PAC Senate Leadership Fund have each spent north of $1 million to elevate Hyde-Smith, while Democrats\u2019 Senate Majority PAC has spent at least half a million attacking the GOP senator.\n. . . \n. . .  Democrats are hoping that Hyde-Smith's comments will be enough to turn the race towards Espy, providing him with a similar coalition that carried Jones to the Senate from Alabama last year.  \u201cIt turns out when you compete and have a strong candidate, you can win and you can be competitive,\u201d Trippi said. \n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  Predictit has Hyde-Smith at only 89-90%"], [691, "2018-11-23T15:48:56Z", [0.99, 0.01], ""], [47482, "2018-11-23T09:51:05Z", [0.99, 0.01], "Splitting the diff between @Anneinak & @Christopher-Fenn"], [691, "2018-11-22T13:00:43Z", [0.99, 0.01], ""], [37512, "2018-11-22T05:42:56Z", [0.55, 0.45], ""], [29646, "2018-11-22T05:12:34Z", [0.95, 0.05], "Rating this one \u201cSolid Republican\u201d."], [46762, "2018-11-22T01:45:15Z", [0.94, 0.06], ""], [31450, "2018-11-21T23:52:25Z", [0.92, 0.08], "I would go all in on Hyde-Smith but she isn't exactly a good campaigner with the gaffes."], [82, "2018-11-21T23:27:02Z", [0.9, 0.1], "I was at 95, until some major gaffes by Hyde-smith.

The crowd is at 99%!  This is insanity!  It's the pitts to lose accuracy points because I don't think that Hyde-Smith has a 100% chance of being re-elected.  So, should I increase my forecast to 100% and risk the dreaded 2.0 Brier???    Let's say that 10% of Hyde-Smith's original support of 41% was moderates who might be turned off by her gaffes.  10% of 41% = 4%.   So 41%, less 4%, plus 16% from the other GOP candidate, that gives her 53%.    On the news tonight, Espy said he'd have to get 95% of the Afro-American vote (Afro-Americans are 37-38% of the voters) as well as some of the white vote.  Historically, Afro-American candidates in Mississippi \"top out\" at about 44% of the vote, so Espy will have to do something nobody has done since 1982.   So, this race may hinge on turnout.  One thing DJT is good at is firing  up his base, and he has an approval rating of 18% in Mississippi, so his campaigning could be very effective and clinch the deal.  However, Hyde-Smith's gaffes have activated the Democrats, who have sent in volunteers for a get-out-the-vote effort to help Espy. Predictit has Hyde-Smith @ 90%:  that seems sensical to me.

First, Hyde-Smith garnered 41.5% of the vote, while her Democratic competitor, Mike Espy (D) won only 40.6% (https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/live-updates/midterms/midterm-election-updates/mississippi-senate-race-heads-to-runoff/) Second, Republican State Senator Chris McDaniel (R) received 16.5% of the vote. It is rational to conclude that the majority of McDaniel's voters will back Hyde-Smith in the special election runoff, rather than electing a Democratic Senator (https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/12/mississippi-senate-race-cindy-hyde-smith-faces-mike-espy-in-runoff.html). Third, President Trump's approval rating in Mississippi is significantly high at 59% compared to a mere 36% unapproval rating. Therefore, it is rational to conclude that Mississippi voters will select Hyde-Smith, a candidate who will be more likely to support President Trump's policies and agenda. Fourth, President Trump announced that he will hold a rally in Mississippi on the eve of the election, in which, more likely than not, he will bolster support for Hyde-Smith by directing his supporters to elect her (https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/14/trump-mississippi-visit-hyde-smith-hanging-remark-990602). Lastly, despite controversy surrounding Hyde-Smith's recent statements, it is unlikely that Mississippi voters will elect a Democratic Senator to represent their state, as the last time a Democratic Senator was elected in Mississippi was 1982 (https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/416761-hyde-smiths-public-hanging-joke-shakes-up-mississippi-runoff)."], [5018, "2018-11-16T23:22:36Z", [0.92, 0.08], ""], [82, "2018-11-16T23:04:20Z", [0.9, 0.1], ""], [20284, "2018-11-16T21:58:09Z", [1.0, 0.0], "This is Mississippi.
