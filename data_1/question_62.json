There are rumours that the current crown prince, Mohammed bin Nayef, 56, could even eventually be moved aside for Mohammed bin Salman. \"Unsurprisingly, the prince\u2019s rise has caused ripples, and has antagonised some other members of the vast royal House of Saud who resent being shunted aside by the younger generation.

Often such analyses ignored the enduring foundations of Saudi rule: the ruthless determination to stay in power that kept family rivalries in check; the alliance with the Wahabbist establishment that provided the house of Saud with religious legitimacy; and the world\u2019s deepest reserves of oil that allowed Riyadh to buy loyalty and to fend off adversaries. \"Much of the \u201ccoming fall\u201d Saudiology was also based on the thin data and voluminous rumours that still surround one of the least transparent regimes in the world.

What is different this time is the lack of a clear line of succession, which raises the stakes. The customary cautious, consensual approach of Saudi princes is not going to win Mohammed bin Salman the throne. . . . \"One anecdote provides some insight into the prince\u2019s ambition. Just after he became Defence Minister, a Saudi-watching friend of mine showed me a digital photo doing the rounds. It was an image of Mohammed bin Salman that after a few seconds dissolved into a picture of the founder of the Saudi state, Ibn Saud, highlighting the similarities in their physical and, by implication, other features. \"Quite what Mohammed bin Nayef can do about this is not clear. Some speculate he is biding his time, giving the young prince enough rope to hang himself. But what gives the rivalry added \u00adpiquancy is the oil price problem. Some of this is Saudi Arabia\u2019s own doing. It has refused to cut oil production, keen to preserve its market share and deliver an economic poke in the eye to rival oil producers in Russia and Iran, as well as to the shale oil wildcatters of the US. The costs of this policy are rising. Saudi Arabia is not about to go broke, but that is not the point. Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil wealth funds the highly subsidised, little-taxed lifestyle at the heart of the house of Saud\u2019s political bargain with its people. If the royal family cannot deliver the free education and healthcare, cheap housing and easy jobs Saudis are used to, they might shift their political allegiance. . . . \n. . . \n\" . . . the economic reform being championed by Mohammed bin Salman as a \u00adcipher for his ambition is actually really needed by the Saudi state. This matters enormously in the region and for the global economy.\n. . . \n\"Much of this boils down to whether Mohammed bin Salman is some underestimated genius or a reckless pretender. In the interview with The Economist, he professed himself to be an admirer of Winston Churchill and the wartime British prime minister\u2019s line that opportunities come from crises. The question is, what opportunities will he seek: to advance Saudi Arabia\u2019s interests, or merely his own?

The Omani ruler Sultan Qaboos is an old man now but his tact and wisdom surely led him to no other conclusion than to avoid a project orchestrated by the hasty and ruthlessly ambitious bin Salman.\n. . . \n\". . .  this announcement and the accompanying press conference, a rare thing indeed when presided over by such a powerful member of the House of Saud, had little in reality to do with the war against Daesh. Rather it was another statement of intent, played out deliberately to an international audience, by the young prince in a very big hurry. \"Bin Salman in the few short months since his ailing father ascended the throne has accumulated vast swathes of power. Always the favoured son and his father\u2019s gatekeeper, he has strengthened his position incrementally and on an almost daily basis. \"The appointments as defence minister and deputy crown prince were followed by a consolidation of the royal court system which he now controls. He is chairman of the enormously powerful Council for Economic and Development Affairs. He oversees the operation of state-owned Saudi Aramco and runs the kingdom\u2019s sovereign wealth fund PIF (Public Investment Fund) with its assets of $5.3bn. And he strides the world stage meeting Vladimir Putin in Moscow and Barack Obama in Washington. \"Needless to say this 30-year-old\u2019s rapid rise within the tight and claustrophobic world of the Saudi royal hierarchy has raised many hackles among his elders. Rumours of a palace coup have swirled for months but remain just that: rumours. \"Before the death of King Abdullah in January, Interior Minister Mohammed bin Nayef was thought to be the most powerful man in the kingdom and the one considered in the West to be a trusted and effective ally in the war on extremism.  Highly respected in Washington and London for the pragmatic way in which he dealt with Saudi Arabia\u2019s internal security threats, the 57-year-old bin Nayef has had to tread a careful path since the accession of King Salman. He has had to watch, perhaps with impotent rage, his power base being significantly eroded.\nIndeed it is said amongst the cognoscenti in Riyadh that he sleeps with one eye open, wondering what move his youthful rival will next play against him.\n. . . \nMohammed bin Salman has told the West that he too shares their concern with \u201cfighting this disease (extremism) which has damaged the Islamic world.\u201d . . . He, not Mohammed bin Nayef, is the go-to guy on global terror and security. He, in his command centre in Riyadh, and not the interior minister will coordinate a transnational war on Islamist extremists. \"In the first blush of the announcement, this may be music to Western ears but it will grate harshly on those of Mohammed bin Nayef. Crown prince he may be, but as his power wanes and his presence diminishes so too do his chances of ever becoming king. \"For entirely different reasons the rest of us would do well to be wary too.

He asked aides to identify areas in need of reform and officials who could be promoted. His spadework led to what analysts describe as a tsunami reshuffle when the monarch assumed the throne in January, on the death of his half-brother King Abdullah. Never in the kingdom\u2019s history had so many royal decrees been issued at once, with dozens of new officials appointed to government. \"King Salman also broke with tradition by shifting power to the second generation of princes. Officials speak of a different \u201ctempo\u201d and a willingness to challenge the way things have been done in the past. They argue that the collapse in oil prices should be seen as an opportunity to clean up Saudi finances and diversify the economy. The sidelining of other royals and the accumulation of power in the hands of Mohammed bin Salman have, however, sparked speculation of royal infighting. \"Close watchers of the al-Sauds say dissent in the family is real, but that those who have lost out lack the momentum to present a threat to the king. Of greater concern to observers are perceptions of a power struggle between the crown prince and the deputy crown prince.\n\u201cUntil recently we had several independent power centres in Saudi Arabia, with each senior prince taking decisions, and there was no long-term planning. Now you can have a united decision-making process \u2014 but the big concern is that a lot of power is with one prince,\u201d says a Riyadh-based analyst. \"As Mohammed bin Salman looks to consolidate his position, the success or failure of his economic plans \u2014 and the war in Yemen \u2014 will be the yardsticks against which he is measured.  . . .\n\n\"The government has slashed public spending by a quarter,. . . . The swingeing $80bn in cuts, bringing spending down to $267bn, will be followed by more austerity next year . . .  Among the priority targets are energy subsidies that cost the treasury 13.2 per cent of gross domestic product, less than half of which go to households. Officials are studying ways of raising non-oil revenues via government fees and a sales tax. But they will broaden existing welfare payments to redistribute money to poor and middle-class Saudis who will be hit hardest by higher electricity, water and petrol prices. \"Sceptics say promises of reforms have been made in the past but not delivered. Arbitrary decision-making and the absence of checks and balances in the system also undermine fiscal discipline: when King Salman took over he announced a salary bonus for public sector employees and utilities investment totalling an estimated $30bn. \"An ingrained administration that is resistant to change is a further impediment.  . . . \n. . . \n\"There are signs that government cuts are damaging business confidence. The private sector, dependent on government spending, is reeling from the sharp retrenchment. \u201cThe business community feels there are too many sudden changes in regulations and where we\u2019re going. We need stability in the way we move forward,\u201d says Lama al-Sulaiman, vice-president of the chamber of commerce in Jeddah. \"The ruling family, backed by the clerical establishment, have for decades provided jobs and a cheap cost of living for their subjects in return for loyalty to the tribally based, authoritarian system of governance. At the height of the unrest that swept the Arab world, the government showered the population with salary increases and new social spending while cracking down on dissent. Five years on, moves to change the social contract threaten to upend that delicate balance of power as regional threats abound. \"Human rights groups say the government continues to use the judicial system to stifle dissent by jailing Shia and pro-democracy activists for anti-government activity, as well as religious crimes such as apostasy or insulting Islam. The number of executions this year has risen to the highest level in two decades, prompting increasing scrutiny of the tough judicial system that mirrors some of the punishments meted out by Isis in the areas it controls in Syria. \"The new Saudi regime boosted its popularity in the first months in office with the launch of a bombing campaign in Yemen as Houthi rebels moved south after taking over the capital Sana\u2019a.  . . . Thousands of civilian casualties have raised western concerns about the military campaign, which appears to have settled into a war of attrition, even as public support in Saudi Arabia remains strong. While there is some cautious talk in Riyadh about a truce, the fact is that the Saudis will have to pick up the cost of rebuilding its impoverished neighbour, having spent billions of dollars on helping to demolish it. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of frustration about how they\u2019ve run the campaign,\u201d says a senior western official amid concerns that jihadis have exploited the conflict to widen their presence in the country. \"Observers say the Yemen campaign has also reinforced anti-Shia sentiment in Saudi Arabia, where a Shia minority in the eastern province already feels marginalised. \u201cSupport for the campaign has been partly built on sectarianism and hatred towards the Shia,\u201d says one Riyadh-based observer.\n. . . \n\"Delivering a radically different Saudi economy and a more assertive foreign policy are in line with the aspirations of an overwhelmingly young Saudi population: 60 per cent are under the age of 30. A kingdom that is friends with the US, but more self-reliant, one that benefits from oil wealth but does not rely solely on it, are popular aspirations. \"But the first test facing the monarchy lies in implementation, whether on the economic front or on security. Saudi businessmen remember bitterly earlier periods of low oil prices and promises of diversification that were abandoned when the outlook for crude improved. The Yemen war, meanwhile, has not inspired greater confidence in Saudi military capabilities among its allies. \"The monarchy must also manage the impact of change on the relationship between rulers and ruled. Saudis are subjected to restrictions on free speech but they are active users of social media and public opinion cannot be ignored. There is growing awareness of corruption and the excessive spending of the royal elite, which could derail attempts to impose more austerity. \"Saudi Arabia is in desperate need of reform but the sweeping changes envisaged take the kingdom into uncharted territory, creating demands for popular representation, which has no place in the monarchy\u2019s vision of the future.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  In my mind, all of this does not add up to a change in leadership in the time-frame of this question.\n"], [11057, "2015-11-30T01:39:47Z", [0.74, 0.19, 0.04, 0.02, 0.01], ""], [12163, "2015-11-29T21:35:44Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [833, "2015-11-29T19:15:00Z", [0.98, 0.0, 0.02, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [12167, "2015-11-29T18:45:46Z", [0.95, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.02], ""], [11788, "2015-11-29T16:56:55Z", [0.95, 0.03, 0.01, 0.01, 0.0], ""], [691, "2015-11-29T14:48:49Z", [0.84, 0.09, 0.05, 0.01, 0.01], ""], [38, "2015-11-29T04:53:49Z", [0.79, 0.04, 0.01, 0.0, 0.16], "http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2015/11/28/saud-n28.html \"The Saudi regime faces a growing internal crisis that has become especially acute in recent months, after a stampede in September killed more than 2,000 during the annual Hajj pilgrimage in Mina, Mecca.

[I] meet people I really like and see intriguing countertrends. \". . . the conservative clergy is still part of the ruling bargain here - some of the most popular Twitter voices are religious firebrands - and those religious leaders still run the justice system and sentence liberal bloggers to flogging, and they're still in denial about how frustrated the world is with the ideology they've exported. \"But I also ran into something I didn't know: Something is stirring in this society. This is not your grandfather's Saudi Arabia. . . . \"Actually, it's not even my father's Saudi Arabia anymore - it is not even my generation's Saudi Arabia anymore,\" the country's 52-year-old foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, said to me.\n. . . \n\"It appears that conservatives here have a lot more competition now for the future identity of this country, thanks to several converging trends. First, most of Saudi Arabia is younger than 30. Second, a decade ago, King Abdullah said he'd pay the cost for any Saudi who wanted to study abroad. That's resulted in 200,000 Saudis studying overseas today (including 100,000 in the United States), and now 30,000 a year are coming back with Western degrees and joining the labor force. You now see women in offices everywhere, and several senior officials whispered to me how often the same conservatives who decry women in the workplace quietly lobby them to get their daughters into good schools or jobs. \"Finally, Twitter and YouTube exploded - a godsend for a closed society. Young Saudis are using Twitter to talk back to the government and to converse with one another on the issues of the day, producing more than 50 million tweets per month. \"What's been missing was a leadership ready to channel this energy into reform. Enter the new King Salman's son, Mohammed bin Salman, the 30-year-old deputy crown prince, who, along with the moderate crown prince, Mohammed bin Nayef, has embarked on a mission to transform how Saudi Arabia is governed. \"I spent an evening with Mohammed bin Salman at his office, and he wore me out. With staccato energy bursts, he laid out in detail his plans. His main projects are an online government dashboard that will transparently display the goals of each ministry, with monthly KPIs - key performance indicators - for which each minister will be held accountable. His idea is to get the whole country engaged in government performance. Ministers tell you: Since Mohammed arrived, big decisions that took two years to make now happen in two weeks.\n. . . \n\"Bottom line: There are still dark corners here exporting intolerant ideas. But they seem to now have real competition from both the grass roots and a leadership looking to build its legitimacy around performance, not just piety or family name. As one Saudi educator said to me, \"There is still resistance to change,\" but there is now much more \"resistance to the resistance.\"\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  \nThe saying is that all rebellions arise during times of rising expectations.  For younger Saudis, expectations of modernization may be rising.  However, older, more conservative Saudi's may see cultural and financial disaster on the horizon, which may cause them to rise up.  There's about 7,000 members of the Saudi Royal family and $38B was distributed around the kingdom when the new king ascended to the throne.

King Salman reportedly was hospitalized earlier in October for what was believed to be a condition brought about by his worsening Alzheimer\u2019s disease. In his \u201ctemporary absence,\u201d palace insiders say, the monarch\u2019s two crown princes took charge.  The 79-year-old monarch has since returned to work, meeting with US Secretary of State John Kerry and other foreign officials in recent weeks. \"But longtime observers say what palace officials refuse to admit publicly: King Salman is unlikely to continue his reign unaided. As a result, bitter infighting over his succession has begun and has exposed a sharp division between conservative and reformist branches in the royal family.\n. . . \n\"In Salman\u2019s absence, palace insiders say, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef took charge of interior security and Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the ailing king\u2019s son, handled foreign affairs, economic, and defense portfolios.  Yet because of Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s unfettered access to his father\u2019s advisers and his role in leading the war in Yemen, palace insiders say the young prince has assumed greater responsibility and at times has served as \u201cde facto head of state.\u201d\n\u201cAll final decisions pass first through Prince Mohammed bin Salman,\u201d one royal court official said. \"Under the current line of succession established by Salman, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, 56, would be next in line to the throne, followed by Prince Mohammed bin Salman, 30.  Both princes have supporters within and outside the kingdom. Mohammed bin Nayef has built ties with Washington by positioning Saudi Arabia as an ally in fighting terrorism, while Prince Mohammed bin Salman has styled himself as an economic liberalizer. \n. . . \n\"Still, battle over control of the kingdom is not a simple two-horse race. According to longtime Saudi observers, a wider struggle between reformers and conservatives is underway within the 271-year-old House of Saud. Reformists within the royal family quickly soured on King Salman. . . . \u201cThe Saudi government and Saudi Royal family have always been a balance between conservative forces and calls for change, and King Salman has swung in favor of the conservatives \u2013 this may have caused a backlash,\u201d says Frederic Wehrey, senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace\u2019s Middle East Program. \"Reformists reportedly also reject Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who they fear will continue his father\u2019s legacy. Instead, they favor another candidate for the throne: Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, son of the late Saudi founder Abdulaziz Ibn Saud, who they claim by birthright holds a more legitimate claim to the throne. \"In a rare public display of royal infighting, an unnamed prince published an open letter in September calling for King Salman\u2019s dismissal, extolling Prince Ahmed\u2019s credentials. Reformists say Prince Ahmed showed leniency towards political prisoners during his term as deputy interior minister. \"Among those clamoring for change in the palace are royals who object to King Salman\u2019s unorthodox succession plan, which leapfrogged 11 of Abdulaziz Ibn Saud\u2019s surviving sons (Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef are both grandsons of the late patriarch.) \u201cIt has long been an established rule in Saudi that the greatest threat to the ruler\u2019s power comes from his first constituency: the royal family,\u201d says Gregory Gause, a Gulf expert and professor of international affairs at Texas A&M University.  \u201cSince the 1960s, the way of avoiding conflict was power-sharing among a set of princes,\" he says. \"Salman has upset the tradition by consolidating a lot of power in those two princes and now we are seeing this playing out.\u201d \"A name being put forward by some conservatives is Prince Muqrin bin Abdulaziz, the former head of Saudi intelligence services. In April he was removed from the post of crown prince and the line of succession by King Salman. \"The removal of a Saudi king by disgruntled royals is not without precedent. In 1964, a group of Abdulaziz Ibn Saud\u2019s sons forced then-King Saud, their brother, to abdicate because of his reckless spending and erratic behavior.  While such an internal coup could occur, it would only take place under a broad agreement, observers say. When faced with external challenges, such as what Saudi Arabia sees as a growing threat posed by regional rival Iran, Saudi royals tend to close ranks in order to ensure stability, at least in the short term. \u201cAt the end of the day, this is a family that closes ranks in the face of external threats,\u201d Mr. Wehrey said. \u201cThere may be jockeying for power within the royal family \u2013 but even that jockeying has its limits.\u201d"], [2380, "2015-11-11T02:50:52Z", [0.99, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01], "No change.

Here are just a few items I suggest are at least interesting to consider:\n1) I believe we can safely assume that \"financial assets\" are those that, upon instruction, can be converted into cash in some reasonable time. Generally liquid assets, cash and near-cash equivalents. Let's just say everything but hard assets (physical property).\n2) Reports have it that the Saudi fortune, the so-called sovereign fund, which is entwined with the Kingdom, has experienced financial asset redemptions of anywhere from 12.5 to 20% over the course of the past twelve months. That is, simplistically speaking, the Saudi royals are calling their brokers with instructions to sell shares and send them the money. These redemptions, presumably, are going to expenses. The Saudis are, apparently, spending money far more rapidly than they are bringing it in.\n3) Simultaneously, we have the story that the Saudi \"strategy\" of flooding the market with cheap oil is oh-so \"successful.\" Everything must be done to preserve \"market share.\" Well, if you just stop to think about it, the basic idea of a market share strategy in a natural resource commodity market is rather ludicrous. Sure, there are the logistical relationships, and the financial pressure placed on competitors. etc. But a natural resource commodity market has certain characteristics. a) The commodities, unlike, say, a factory that is tooled to produce automobiles, do not go away when the owners go bankrupt. New owners come in, but the commodities, in this case oil, remain. b) In such a commodities market, buyers take whatever is offered by whomever it is offered. The fact that you sold me oil last month at the best price (for which I paid and thanked you) should have little impact on whom I buy oil from this month. A marketshare strategy in a natural resource commodities market is, frankly, baloney. Since (Units Sold [Market Share] x Price/Unit) = Income is the inescapable economic equation, we see that this strategy of maximizing/maintaining market share is only half the equation. The rational goal is to maximize income, not market share. Rather than suggesting the Saudis are irrational, I suggest that the story of maximizing marketshare be recognized as only a component in some larger scheme; and considered by itself as only a ruse, a cover story. But a cover story for what? At the surface, it would be a cover story for the Saudis' massive depletion of their financial assets. Lacking such a story, the world would have wondered where the Saudis were suddenly taking such a large percentage of their wealth. They are doing something with it, but what? What expenses have they converted their redemptions into? Yes, there are expenses of the Kingdom -- but what goes elsewhere in the wash? What activities would require such massively large secretive funding?\n4) Just for speculative consideration, couched in pure hyperbole for emphasis: What is it that the Saudis want so desperately that they are willing to spend hundreds of billions in bribery to obtain? And, who would be in a position to provide it for them? (There is, of course, the more mundane but only sightly less dramatic explanation for a marketshare strategy in a commodity market: to secretly acquire, after bankruptcy, through covert agents, the assets (the oil rights) of those competitive firms driven into bankruptcy.  This is the classic consolidation scheme that was used in early 20th century America. The problem with this scenario is that the oil assets are only just beginning to turn over now, slowly; so the Saudi financial assets would not have been required in such large quantities as have already been redeemed.) I simply do not buy the marketshare strategy at all. As to King Salman, he inherited the marketshare strategy (and whatever underlying scheme it is designed to obscure). The rumors of palace intrigue, and the implicit threats contained therein, are to keep him in line. His life is in some danger so long as the role of Saudi King is required for orchestration of the scheme. Only completion of the scheme or revelation of its secretive nature would remove the danger. I'm guessing that he continues to play the game."], [4568, "2015-10-24T08:53:06Z", [0.95, 0.02, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01], "The main question is on the health and longevity of King Salman.

Saudi Arabia has only had seven monarchs since 1932: Ibn Saud (1932-53), Saud (1953-64), Faisal (64-75) Khalid (1975-82), Fahd (1982-2005), Abdullah (2005-15), and Salman (2015-Present). Excluding Salman, the average reign of a Saudi King has been over 13 years. Most kings have also reigned until their death. The exceptions are Faisal, who was assassinated, and Saud, who was forced to abdicate.  2) King Salman in currently 79 years old. Using U.S. social security actuarial tables as a proxy (presumably Salman has access to some pretty top-notch doctors), the probability of a 79 year old male dying within the year is only about 5 per cent or so. However, it is worth noting that some outlets have reported that Salman is in ill health, though it is not entirely clear what ails him.  3) Given the size of the House of Saud (which has thousands of members), some inter-family politicking is to be expected, particularly at a time when there is less money to spread around. That being said, it isn't clear that the letters calling for the replacement of Salman and his heir are actually from a member of the royal family.  4) Salman and his heirs still appear to enjoy the support of a number of powerful actors, including the clerical establishment and the military. The rest of the royal family has also been relatively supportive (or at least silent). According to the Guardian, only one senior royal has publically endorsed the letter calling for Salman's replacement.
