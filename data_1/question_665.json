How long will it take for Uber to satisfy all of the demands from the TFL and how long will it take the TFL to validate that it has met those demands (List of offenses below).  I don't think that this is plausible by year end. 2) Mayor Says Give it to Them:  The reality is that Uber is allowed to operate anyhow, why not avoid legal expenses and the like and just offer Uber the license.  Given the recent commentary from the mayor (who has ultimate authority over the TFL), I see this as a probable event.  Since #1 is not plausible in the timeline, this is the only real alternative and the odds of it have increased substantially.  The question is, can the TFL actually do this when it has demands already on the table?
