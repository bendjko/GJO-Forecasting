Leaders from around the globe began adding their signatures to a treaty that bans nuclear weapons, although the world\u2019s nine nuclear-armed countries declined to sign it and denounced it as dangerously na\u00efve. President Hassan Rouhani of Iran, responding to Mr. Trump\u2019s denunciation of the Iran nuclear deal as \u201can embarrassment,\u201d defended the agreement in his own remarks to the General Assembly on Wednesday. Mr. Rouhani said the agreement could be \u201ca new model for global interactions.\u201d --https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/20/world/united-nations-general-assembly.html"], [31142, "2017-09-24T16:50:47Z", [0.0, 0.75, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2017-09-24T15:58:10Z", [0.0, 0.55, 0.45, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [12879, "2017-09-24T15:12:52Z", [0.0, 0.25, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [29145, "2017-09-24T14:59:51Z", [0.0, 0.2, 0.79, 0.01, 0.0], ""], [37368, "2017-09-24T13:54:20Z", [0.0, 0.83, 0.14, 0.03, 0.0], ""], [12302, "2017-09-24T13:26:56Z", [0.0, 0.13, 0.56, 0.3, 0.01], ""], [35033, "2017-09-24T08:33:32Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1646, "2017-09-24T01:42:39Z", [0.0, 0.45, 0.43, 0.12, 0.0], ""], [1646, "2017-09-24T01:41:53Z", [0.0, 0.2, 0.65, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [36505, "2017-09-23T20:39:55Z", [0.0, 0.65, 0.3, 0.04, 0.01], ""], [368, "2017-09-23T20:32:14Z", [0.01, 0.99, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [37368, "2017-09-23T13:42:53Z", [0.0, 0.8, 0.15, 0.04, 0.01], ""], [68, "2017-09-23T13:27:38Z", [0.0, 0.5, 0.4, 0.1, 0.0], "My initial thought was that all 122 nations who voted for this treaty would sign, but within the first three days, when practically all had high level presence at the UN, only 53 had signed by 22 September.
