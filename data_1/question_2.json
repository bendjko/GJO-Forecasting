The possible wildcard for these elections is the danger of falsifications that are expected to be implemented by the ruling party (AKP), and which may result in stealing the necessary 20 seats from the other parties; or in HDP (the main opposition party) not passing the threshold (which will boost the other parties greatly and give AKP the coveted majority).

The reason AKP didn't get a majority last time was because the HDP got more than 10% of the vote share and hence entered parliament. Polls till now indicate that the HDP is likely to retain its vote share this time. Thus, AKP's main hope is to take votes from the other parties, in particular the nationalist MHP. The hard line taken against terrorism may be helping them here. A combination of attracting MHP voters plus making it difficult for HDP supporters to turn out could come close to giving AKP the 18 additional seats needed for a majority. However, what has swayed me the most is Angela Merkel's indication that the EU is considering giving Turks (among other things) visa-free entry, in return for Turkey keeping Syrian refugees (Turkey is currently the only applicant to the EU which does not have this concession).  The AKP is bargaining hard at the moment, and this may attract some of the more liberal/secular voters as well, who have seen Turkey repeatedly rebuffed by Europe in the past. http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/merkels-visit-strikes-cynical-chord-in-turks.aspx?pageID=238&nID=90078&NewsCatID=416 http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/0d4495d4-7416-11e5-bdb1-e6e4767162cc.html?ftcamp=crm/email/20151019/nbe/InTodaysFT/product#axzz3p5rNxjM2"], [783, "2015-10-20T04:32:04Z", [0.15, 0.85, 0.0], "In a September 12th forecast, I wrote that his assets that would change his polling trend were:\nHe could win by declaring he is the war president and wrap the flag around him. \nHe could employ other means to convince and coerce non-supportive party opposition to support him that went to the MHP. His \"tough talk appears\" to have regained nationalists who were supporting the MHP, including bruising rhetorical attacks on the West, and the government\u2019s counter-terror operations against separatist Kurds (Dettmer, 2015). With just 12 days to go to the November 1 polls, Erdo\u011fan and top party officials have intensified their belligerent rhetoric, lambasting Europeans and the West in general and maintaining an 'us-verses-them' view of the country. The Kurds, members of other minority communities, leftists and opposition activists are being relegated to 'them' status in a politics of polarization which will make it highly difficult to agree on a coalition government after the November 1 polls, if the AKP fails to secure a majority (ibid). In general, he has returned to the rhetoric that allowed him to stay in power, He is angry that the US is supporting groups in Syria that he opposes and that the US will not permit a no-fly zone in Syria that will extend his influence. But he is framing it as an insult against Turkey and returns to an us against them strategy that has all but alienated his neighbors but not so much his voters. But his neighboring countries do not vote in the election.  He may gain votes from the National Action Party, but perhaps not enough to make the swap vote into a majority, that depends on how many voters he gathers from the MHP.  The opposition parties do not have adequate resources to finance a new campaign. Almost all opposition channels are banned from major cable TV operators as well as broadcasting platforms (Kiniklio\u011flu, 2015). This is a complaint other media have reported as well. Opposition newspapers have been sacked and Turkey ranks  #154 out of 180 by Reporters without Borders in Journalism freedom. https://index.rsf.org/#!/index-details/TUR\nThis gives the AKP more media coverage than the opposition groups in this election in Turkey.

Source: Dateline 9-13-15 Since Sept. 8, Turkey has been the scene of nationwide attacks on Kurds that are unprecedented since the PKK took up arms in 1984. The wave of violence erupted after two massive PKK bomb attacks killed 16 soldiers and 14 policemen on Sept. 6 and Sept. 8, respectively, spreading to almost all the provinces outside the Kurdish-majority regions of the southeast. Nationalist groups took to the streets, assaulting Kurdish civilians, Kurdish-owned businesses and offices of the pro-Kurdish Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party (HDP), which had emerged as Turkey\u2019s third-largest party in the June 7 elections, winning 13.1% of the vote and 80 seats in the 550-member parliament. The party\u2019s offices in 56 provinces and districts were stoned, vandalized and torched. The attacks reached a peak late Sept. 8 when a mob of some 500 people stormed HDP headquarters in downtown Ankara, ransacking and burning part of the building. Turkish nationalists, reported to have mobilized via social media, also attacked intercity buses carrying passengers to Kurdish-majority regions. Dozens of buses, singled out according to their license plates or company names, had their windows broken under hails of stones, while others were stopped and their passengers verbally and physically harassed. As a result, bus companies operating between the western regions and Diyarbakir, the largest city in the southeast, canceled services Sept. 9-10 to protest the violence. Impoverished Kurdish workers struggling to make a living from seasonal agricultural jobs across the country were not spared beatings and harassment. Meanwhile, one of the worst nights of horror unfolded Sept. 8 in the central Anatolian city of Kirsehir, where more than 20 Kurdish-owned businesses and shops, including the city\u2019s only bookstore, were torched. The local HDP office was vandalized, and vehicles bound for the southeast were stoned at the city\u2019s bus terminal. According to witnesses, the assailants, who numbered in the thousands, carried lists of their targets. Kirsehir Gov. Necati Senturk blamed the violence on \u201cprovocateurs who mingled into an innocent demonstration to condemn terrorism.\u201d\n http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/09/turkey-pkk-clashes-heading-to-turk-kurd-strife.html"], [710, "2015-09-14T12:59:30Z", [0.25, 0.75, 0.0], ""], [83, "2015-09-13T22:12:44Z", [0.65, 0.34, 0.01], "http://www.dailysabah.com/elections/2015/09/05/survey-ak-party-will-regain-overall-majority-in-early-elections Projection that MHP may lose votes of supporters due to failure of MHP to join a AKP coalition."], [254, "2015-09-13T20:42:51Z", [0.1, 0.9, 0.0], "Based on the latest info that I could find."], [38, "2015-09-13T17:20:08Z", [0.17, 0.83, 0.0], "Erdogan wants not only a majority but a supermajority so he can push through some changes to the Constitution which would give him more power.

A poll conducted by Varyans Research Company predicts that the AK Party will regain some votes it lost in the June 7 parliamentary election and hold an absolute majority after the early elections on Nov. 1 Ahead of the early elections to be held on Nov. 1, the latest survey by Varyans Research indicates that the Justice and Development Party (AK Party) has regained support over the past two months and that the party is close to recovering the overall majority it lost in the June 7 parliamentary elections. Turkey is moving toward an election after no party was able to grab a majority in the June 7 parliamentary elections. Before the critical snap election, questions have arisen over which way the nation will vote, whether the AK Party will manage to hold a majority and how the latest terror attacks by the PKK terrorist organization will affect the public's voting habits. The party lost nearly 9 percent of the vote on June 7 compared to the 2011 parliamentary election and that the reason behind the decrease is mainly the party's approach to the Kurdish issue. Underscoring that the discourse to be adopted by the party is of the utmost importance during this pre-election period, Sazkaya said: \"The government should ease people's lives [in eastern Turkey] and advance counterterrorism methods in cooperation with the region's people, while fighting terrorism.\"  Improvement should also be made in deputy candidate lists since candidate profiles play a crucial role in voting habits in provinces where Kurdish people are in the majority. \"The top figures in the party should also adopt an inclusive discourse for those who did not vote for the AK Party.  \"Nearly 60 percent want to see a party in power alone.  He remarked that some voters who supported the AK Party in previous elections but voted for the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) on June 7 might return to the AK Party due to the conflicting remarks and \"uncompromising stance\" by MHP Chairman Devlet Bah\u00e7eli over the coalition government. \"Both parties' voter profile is close to each other, and according to our research, the AK Party grassroots want to see the MHP as a coalition partner and vice versa. But, Bah\u00e7eli's stance toward the coalition talks created a disturbance among the voters, and it will probably result in a loss in the MHP's votes,\" he added.  According to the survey, the AK Party would be able to come to power alone by receiving 43.9 percent of the vote in the Nov. 1 elections with a 3 percent increase in its votes, while the CHP followed it with 26.2 percent with a 1.2 percent increase in its votes. The MHP appears to decrease to 14.1 percent from 16.3 percent while the HDP would decrease to 12.3 percent from 13.1 percent."], [83, "2015-09-05T00:35:05Z", [0.65, 0.34, 0.01], "Ergodan would like a two thirds majority to make constitutional changes to the power of the presidency. Currently, as a result of the June parliamentary elections, he has less than 1/2 of the seats (258 of 550), even preventing the formation of a majority government. What are the possibilities?\n---Less than a plurality: CHP with 132 seats (25.1% of the June vote) would need to overtake the AKP (258 seats, 40.7%)\n---Plurality: Maintain a lead over CHP\n---Majority: Requires a gain of 18 AKP seats over the June election result.  I see two obvious way that this could happen: 1) Parties are required to obtain 10% of the vote for representation in parliament. The Kurdish (HDP) party earned 13% of the vote and 80 seats in the June election, preventing an AKP majority. One strategy would be to prevent HDP from obtaining the 10% result in the November vote, freeing 80 seats, pushing AKP past the majority total.  Several sources indicate the campaign against the PKK, may be an attempt to split the Kurdish HDP vote. 2) Increasing the turn out in non Kurdish areas to a level where the HDP vote is less than 10%. I'll give Ergodan a 60% chance of keeping the HDP vote under 10%, in order to regain a majority.
