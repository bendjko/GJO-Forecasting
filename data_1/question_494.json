Aggregates weekly polls from 7 polling institutes, weighting each according to historical accuracy and adjusting for possible political bias. Using their 80% prediction interval as of 11.09.17 (AfD result to fall between 7.7% and 10.9%) I read off corresponding probabilities for results in the 0-5%, 5-10%, 10-15% and 15%+ brackets.\nAdditional data points considered:\n1. Previous Bundestag elections: of very limited use as the AfD has only contested one previous election (2013). Since then the AfD has radically overhauled its policy platform and leadership to the extent it is practically a different party. Seeking a \"cut-off point\" for the purposes of this prediction, I would say the AfD in its current form \"dates\" from Frauke Petry's assumption of the party leadership in July 2015 (https://www.ft.com/content/456815bc-9291-11e7-a9e6-11d2f0ebb7f0). \n2. Landtag elections: data too limited to have much predictive power but of some use as a sense check. In total the AfD has contested 14 Landtag elections, each in a different Land. 6 of these fell before its radical policy shift in July 2015 so I would say these are of very limited use for this forecast. The remaining 8 elections span the period March 2016 - May 2017:\n- differences between Laender: ignored for the purposes of this very simplistic sense check. I understand the Land electoral systems are broadly similar to the Bundestagwahl (i.e. based on overall voting proportions) and that AfD support has not tended to cluster strongly by geography (https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/afd-waehler-101.html)\n- time trend: the 8 election results follow a broad trend similar to national polling (per weekly poll aggregates) with the highest results in autumn 2016 and a fall back into the single digits in 2017. Supports the view that the best predictors of AfD vote share are events and trends at the national level. The simple average of the three 2017 Landtag election results is 6.5%: in the 5-10% range. \n3. Possible events between now and 24 September, not factored into today's polls, which could affect AfD result:\na) Events which would affect AfD support directly:\n- generally difficult to predict given AfD voting patterns not yet well-understood (https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/afd-waehler-101.htmlb). The rise in AfD support in autumn 2015 continuing into 2016 was associated with the migration crisis and policy response by the German government. However, a significant change in this policy area between now and 24 September is very unlikely. \nb) Events which would affect other parties' support and indirectly affect AfD's share of the vote:\n- too difficult to predict. AfD votes have not been drawn overwhelmingly from former supporters of any one party so an event increasing or reducing support for another party would not have a clear knock-on effect on AfD support.\n"], [691, "2017-09-16T12:06:33Z", [0.0, 0.88, 0.12, 0.0], ""], [38334, "2017-09-16T09:54:41Z", [0.01, 0.4, 0.54, 0.05], "AfD is gaining some ground in the latest polls.

On Sept. 24, it looks as though a party that has racist and nationalist tendencies will win seats in the Bundestag. The AfD is currently between 8 and 11 percent in public opinion polls. And the party won't just change the face of the German parliament, but likely also its culture of political debate. If the AfD ends up with around 10 percent of the vote, it will send 70 lawmakers to parliament. One of them will be Jens Maier, who is second on the AfD's state list from Saxony. Maier wasn't just present when Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, floor leader for the AfD in the state of Thuringia, notoriously referred to the Holocaust Memorial in Berlin as a \"monument to shame\" and called for a \"180-degree shift in our memory politics\" at a Dresden ballroom in January. He warmed up the crowd before H\u00f6cke's tirade. In a brief introduction, he said that after World War II, the Germans were told that they were no longer worth anything: \"I declare herewith this cult of guilt to finally be over!\" Maier crowed. The crowd went wild.\" Comment:   As Angela Merkel seems to be on a trajectory towards victory, the real motivation of this election lies in the makings of a coalition.  AfD is highly motivated and has already achieved much by having seats in 13 of 16 German states. Election polling confirms more support for AfD but it's really more about voter turnout.  The AfD narrative is validated not only by Trump's victory but also by his continued bold, anti-immigration, white supremacist rhetoric and actions . I believe the AfD will  get over 10% based on polling of course but the main thing is motivation for turnout. AfD understands this and yet there are also other forces in the third party category who want to stop them. Today, Merkel announced that she would not agree to any limit on refugees coming into Germany. She hasn't wavered on this so not sure it matters to most voters at this point except for the extremists.. giving them more motivation to vote; all about the turnout."], [11080, "2017-09-13T23:12:27Z", [0.0, 0.68, 0.32, 0.0], ""], [11080, "2017-09-13T23:09:25Z", [0.01, 0.7, 0.29, 0.0], ""], [37236, "2017-09-13T22:31:07Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], "No suprise here ...

Around two dozen young people from around Germany helped launch the \u201cWahl-O-Mat\u201d (roughly Vote-O-Meter) on Wednesday -- an online website that matches people with a party after they answer a series of policy questions (para 1-2). Merkel is widely expected to win a record-tying fourth term, with her CDU/CSU conservatives maintaining a two-digit lead over the SPD despite continuing concerns over her 2015 decision to allow in over a million migrants (para.6). A poll by the Allensbach institute last week showed that 46 percent of voters had not made up their minds on how to vote -- the highest rate since in two decades so close to an election, which is being held on Sept. 24 (para. 8). \u201cWe\u2019ve seen that about six percent of those who were not planning to participate in the election changed their minds after using the tool,\u201d he said (para 13). \u201cInterest is definitely higher in this election, but so is uncertainty.

They are different \npolls, and they see the AFD between 7 and 9 percent at the moment. http://www.wahlrecht.de/umfragen/.\nWhat will happen in September? First of all it is very unlikely that the AFD get less than 5 percent in the elections. Like in other Countries in Europe there is a potential for populist parties in germany. 12 Years with chancelor Angela Merkel, her decision to receiving a large number of refugees in 2015, the sanctions against russia, the feeling that politics and media are moving to the left or simply protest against the system are some reasons that the AFD is getting more than 5 percent. So, a number between 5% and 10% has the highest probability for me. Reasons for this forecast are the different internal problems of the party. For example problems in the states of germany. The parliamentary group of the parliament of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg had a problem with antisemitic members and was temporarily divided. In Saxony-Anhalt different wings of the party fight against each other. These problems are not very helpful for a good campaign for the upcoming election in september. \nhttps://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/AfD_Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg#Auseinandersetzung_um_Wolfgang_Gedeon\nhttps://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/AfD_Sachsen-Anhalt#Innerparteiliche_Konflikte But the core voters don't care that the party is moving more and more to the right the last years and that the internal problems of the AFD paralyse the campaign. The voters who are unhappy with the status quo of political system are a safe basis for the AFD.\nAlso, many ideas of the AFD are too extrem for the most voters in germany. The ideas of the party for example about culture, religion or family are not in common with the ideals of a large number of voters. \nBut is there a chance that the AFD will get more than 10 percent? Of course, there is a chance. For example if more terroristic attacks will happen in the Western World and especially in Germany. Key issues of the AFD are the higher public safety and the repatriation of refugees. Terrorist groups use the routes for refugees for their assassins and with the claim for more security and less refugees the AFD can probably get more votes in the election. Also in some polls the party already has 9 percent and there are also voters who make their decision very late.

Each country saw slight differences in when the high point was reached but by mid-2017 it can be seen that AfD's percentage had fallen from around a high point of around 14% a year ago to about 7% now. In the last 3 months it dropped by about 30%. If that trend continued at the same rate they would get about 5% on election day. \nOf course there is no reason to assume that the trend will continue or that it will be at the same rate. As the German election nears and campaigns start the changes are likely to be more volatile. In the 2013 German election AfD increased its support (according to the polls) between June and the election from about 3% to 4.7%  (having dropped from around 5% in the April).  Each country is of course different and even if general trends affect voters in all western countries, the electoral systems mean that voters wanting to make a protest vote or a negative vote or a tactical vote (by voting for an candidate they don't support to stop the candidate they hate getting elected) will do things differently. In the US for example there were really only two credible parties to vote for, in France the multiple rounds system allows a vote for who you like in the first round and a vote against who you hate in the second round, in the UK there are multiple parties but in each constituency tactical voting can be used to weaken or beat the party that has the most support, but less than majority support. In Germany where seats are proportional voters have less incentive to do negative or tactical voting so it would be expected that the votes cast would be close to what the polls had forecast. \nIn the June UK election the result was said to be a great shock, but the polls had showed support for the Conservatives was dropping very sharply and support for Labour was rising very sharply for the month before the election. This was so sharp that the composite polls (that that took the rolling average of all polls) were a few days behind the true trend, which did make it appear that a hung parliament was likely. \nIt seems very unlikely that any of the German parties will fight such a bad campaign as the UK Conservatives did (it was so bad that its surprising that no one has suggested that Mrs May's manifesto of spectacularly unpopular, irrelevant ideas must have been concocted by Russia to help Labour; did she really think that taking money from her pensioner supporters, and bringing back the school system from the 1950s and reintroducing fox hunting would bring in the votes?)

The hard indicators are the 2017-vote shares IN ELECTORAL STRONGHOLDS OF THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY in the West. If the AfD manages to \"win\", say, in Dortmund, they surely can win other precincts as well. In Dortmund (with 60,000 to 80,000 actual votes per precinct), the AfD's absolute and relative votes were: \u2014 4979 votes, or 9.2% in city precinct one (1/4),\n\u2014 3993 votes, or 7.9% in city precinct two (2/4),\n\u2014 6302 votes, or 8.7% in city precinct three (3/4),\n\u2014 5901 votes, or 7.5% in city precinct four (4/4). Hence, the performance of far-right conservatives within the boundaries of the two to four SPD-gerrymandered precincts and wards should be telling indicator to us. The Dortmund citizens steadily adopted the AfD as a ticket and the absolute and relative votes in this city grew from: \u2014 5188 votes, or 3.5% in federal elections 2013, precinct one (1/2),\n\u2014 5571 votes, or 4.1% in federal elections 2013, precinct two (2/2),\n\u2014 6835 votes, or 3.4% in city council elections 2014, citywide precinct,\n\u2014 11693 votes, or 5.9% in European parliamentary elections 2014, citywide precinct. They consistently touched the five-percent hurdle before the refugee crisis and they surely surpassed it afterwards.  The Dortmund case represents a speculative but reasonable MINIMUM VOTE OUTCOME AND FLOOR for the AfD in September. It is a university town with a large second-generation immigrant population from Turkey, Poland, Romania, foreign exchange students mainly from India and China on the one hand, and a vibrant Nazi youth community on the other. Resistance to right-wing positions is strongest, here, and right-wing resistance to that, too. Interestingly, the forces cancelled each other in terms of actual violence against refugees.

SPD leader Martin Schulz hopes to unseat Chancellor Angela Merkel in the Sept. 24 election, but the center-left party has lost momentum in the polls since making gains following his nomination in January. \"We'll reduce the tax burden for small and medium-sized incomes and we'll support families,\" Schulz told reporters. \"Our proposal is good not just for Germany but also for Europe,\" he said, adding it would help stimulate domestic demand and suck in more imports from other European countries. Schulz said the SPD would increase Germany's top income tax rate to 45 percent from 42 percent, while lifting the threshold from which the rate applied to 76,000 euros ($85,000) from around 54,000 euros. The SPD, currently the junior partner in Merkel's ruling coalition, would also raise the special income levy for those earning 250,000 euros or more to 48 percent from 45 percent. The plans highlight the SPD's aim of putting social justice at the heart of the election campaign.

For most of the time since December 2015, AfD's support has exceeded 10 % (touching 15 % at best), however since November 2016 the trend has been steadily downward and has reached 8 % in the beginning of June 2017.  Looking at the poll trends of the other parties, it seems AfD's support is most closely (inversely) correlated with CDU, which is intuitive for a \"protest\" party. The main driver behind the flux of support between the two parties seems to have been the migrant crisis, not so much terrorist attacks. There was no uptick in AfD support after the Berlin Christmas market attack for example, but the general rise and subsequent fall in support seems to have coincided with the onset and then abating of the migrant situation. All in all, I feel CDU is likely to finish strongly in the run up to the elections, leaving AfD with roughly 8-10 % of the vote.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_German_federal_election,_2017"], [34353, "2017-06-07T12:06:08Z", [0.05, 0.55, 0.35, 0.05], ""], [30594, "2017-06-07T09:46:11Z", [0.03, 0.55, 0.4, 0.02], "Nice question\u2026 I like! Given the polling averages, todays probability of the AfD exceeding 5 percent is 99,5 percent (see polling aggregation, here: https://www.inwt-statistics.de/blog-artikel-lesen/wahlprognose-fuer-die-bundestagswahl-2017.html#Prognose). So I think 5 percent is the lower end of the AfD's popular vote. So what is the upper end? The highest value ever measured was 15,5 on 26 September 2016 by INSA. This was a the climax of the refugee crisis\u2026 So, this is probably the upper end. (see all polls, here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_German_federal_election,_2017) What has to happen that the AfD has more than 15 percent? It is all about media agenda setting: Best would be a flood of refugees AND a terrorist attack AND integration policy becomes a big issue AND the Chancellor ignoring the problems, as she did in 2015/16. \n* Refugees crisis: rather unlikely; Merkel did all she could in EU (Frontex) and international relations (EU-Turkey relations; African policy) to lower the refugee inflow to Europe. She knows that this could strengthen the AfD very much - and that it could be disastrous for Italy, France etc. There is a big interest in strengthening pro-European parties, so leaders of European countries all will avoid strengthening right wing parties, i.e. avoiding a new refugee crisis. And many in the CDU do not want to see a situation like in 2015/16, again.\n* Terrorist attack: likely to very likely; I do not hope it but Germany is a target, for sure. If we have an attack it depends on its scope. CDU has built up some resilience regarding the AfD - but some voters did not forget how Merkel acted in 2015/16. AfD would profit from a large to medium scale terrorist attack, for sure.\n* Integration becomes a big issue in the campaign: likely, mostly because the SPD could set it on the agenda in order to gain a considerable vote share among leftist voters. That would directly help AfD. However, CDU is trying to make some hardliner statements on this issue, as well. They are prepared. \n* Chancellor that is ignoring the problems / reality: Extremely unlikely. Angela Merkel is the Queen of making strong policy shifts that do actually feel remarkably 'soft'\u2026 she did so many times: Euro crisis, atomic energy policy, refugees.\n* Even if all these key factors will be combined, it is not sure that the AfD will raise above 15 percent since the Government can act and will act - and, most notably, the Government has shifted credibly towards homeland security: so the voters will not blame the CDU so much. (And we should not forget: If there is somebody in the world who can somehow handle a crisis without harming herself: it is Angela Merkel!) - I think, given that the CDU - since 2015 - has done a lot to defend its policy position against the AfD: it is very unlikely that the AfD will have more than 15 percent of the popular vote.\n\nWhat has to happen that the AfD is below 5 percent? Clearly, controversies among the top party leaders. Unlikely, however. The party has removed notorious troublemakers. And everybody knows the golden rule of campaigning: Suspend all inner quarrels! May be, there could be a scandal - but even if: it would do harm only to some of the party leaders, not all. And the electorate of the AfD is rather stable: it consists of critics of the German refugee policy AND (never forget!) critics of the policies to 'rescue the Euro'\u2026 The AfD is not (only) a right-wing populist party, it - too - is a 'national liberal' party with outspoken liberal attitudes concerning economic policy, and it is cultivating a soft (!) Euroscepticism (comparable to the Cameron position in the UK). (One should not put the AfD in a basket with Trump, neither the Leave campaigners in UK, Geert Wilders, or Le Pen - that would be wrong.)\n\nWill it be below or above the 10 percent threshold? Very hard to say. Given the current polls and the momentum, it is more likely that they will be below 10 percent. However, as I pointed out when I discussed the Angela Merkel question several times: we still have to go about 14 weeks until election\u2026 that is very much. And the AfD is a party that can easily profit from Government failure and certain media agendas (which are hard to predict). Particularly for the AfD it is true: there is so much contingency! I would estimate that the 95 percent confidence interval for the AfD is somewhere between 6 and 12 percent. For the below 10 percent option (but more than 5 percent) some forecasters estimate more than 66 percent. That seems overrated to me. German electoral politics is comparably less complex, voters are comparably less volatile than in France and Italy - but still, there is considerable leeway. BTW: One should not expect underestimation of the AfD vote share by pollsters. They got it mostly right in the regional elections\u2026 And see the table of Nate Silver on over- and underestimation of right wing parties, here: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/le-pen-is-in-a-much-deeper-hole-than-trump-ever-was/. There is no (!) evidence that right wing parties are systematically underestimated by pollsters. - The best polling aggregation is this: https://www.inwt-statistics.de/blog-artikel-lesen/wahlprognose-fuer-die-bundestagswahl-2017.html#Prognose. A COMMENT ON THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM: \nThe 'second vote' (Zweitstimme) is the only vote that determines the seat share of a party in the Bundestag. The 'first vote' (Erststimme) does only determine which person will sit in parliament for the respective parties in a given one man district. It is theoretically possible to gain more mandates in the Erststimme (one man electoral districts, first-past-the-post) than you gained in the Zweitstimme (proportional representation). However, the seat shares of the proportional representation will be uphold by 'compensation mandates' (Ausgleichsmandate). THEREFORE: You cannot effectively vote for two parties! That is not possible. To cut a long story short: You can take the polls as a valid information of the seat share a party gets. Do not get confused. The important vote in Germany, the one that determines the majorities in the Bundestag is - paradoxically - the 'second vote' ('Zweitstimme'). - And read the question: They clearly refer to 'popular vote' - this is 'Zweitstimme' / 'second vote'. - On the evening of election day nobody in Germany cares about the 'first vote' (Erststimme). Do not do so, either! German electoral system is simple: proportional representation - no the-winner-takes-it-all troubles like in the UK and Electoral College. (In Germany, nobody can understand that there is a US President considered legitimate although he lost the popular vote\u2026 that seems crazy to us.)
