Dateline  7-19-2018  South Korean officials and workers are conducting repair work at the Gaeseong Industrial Complex in North Korea in a bid to open an inter-Korean liaison office there in August.  A Unification Ministry official in Seoul told reporters on Thursday that some of the South Korean group began staying in living quarters set up within the complex earlier this week to carry out the repair work, while others are commuting from home.  Since repair efforts began July second, all of the workers had commuted on a daily basis by crossing the Military Demarcation Line. The facilities in Gaeseong have not been used since South Korea pulled out from the joint industrial complex in February 2016, in the wake of the North's nuclear and missile provocations. The decision to open a liaison office inside Gaeseong was reached at the April 27th summit between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. --

Another factor that would now make it difficult to reopen the complex would be the fact that a U.N. sanctions related review would be needed.  When the complex was open South Korea firms would send the wages to a committee running the complex who would then distribute coupons or bills to the workers which was equal to 30-40 percent of the total wages.

Restarting Kaesong would throw cash at NK and subvert the UN Sanctions regime,  Yet it's not out of the question that SK leadership might go wobbly on this at some point.  SK stepped out of line late last year with an initial refusal not to allow deployment of THAAD.  Eventually they caved and went along with the US.  They still live in hope that appeasement can work.  Nothing will happen until the Olympics are over.

As the Q is worded, it should count, since it will have been announced that the joint is reopening.

This is crucial because South's leverage over the area was originally that it supplied the power / infrastructure to the zone. \n4) The Complex is Inside North Korea:  Thus, they can legally confiscate and utilize the facility even though it's production was largely financed by the South. \n5) Business Alternatives:  There were more than 100 companies operating in the facility at the time of it's closure.  With more than a year having passed, these companies have had time / and needed to transition to a more sustainable production alternative.

I will sit at consensus until we get some guidance. But, if the unilateral reopening by North Korea (if true and substantiated) counts, then it has already happened. I don't think there has been an announcement though."], [38, "2017-10-14T04:09:35Z", [0.11, 0.46, 0.06, 0.02, 0.35], "https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-company-owners-protest-kaesong/4067104.html \"South Korean companies that were forced to shut down operations in the Kaesong Industrial Complex in North Korea in 2016 have petitioned the government in Seoul to investigate reports that Pyongyang has reopened the facility without their consent. The North/South joint venture with South Korea was suspended last year to punish the Kim Jong Un government for conducting nuclear and missile tests, and to cut off a possible source of funding for Pyongyang\u2019s illicit weapons development program. \"The South Korean Unification Ministry could not confirm that the complex has been reopened, but did say that recent bus movements and illuminated street lamps in the site have been observed. \"The Corporate Association of Kaesong Industrial Complex that represents the 123 South Korean manufacturing companies that operated factories in the North Korean facility said Thursday it wants to send a delegation to inspect their property. \u201cIt is our asset, which we invested in according to North Korean law, and procedures set by both governments of the two Koreas. So as owners with rights to the assets, it is necessary for us to check the situation and status of our assets and find out whether the complex is really being operated or not,\u201d said Kim Seo-jin, with the Kaesong Industrial Complex Association. . . . \"To make the complex fully operational again, North Korea would also be hard pressed to replace the electricity supply that came from South Korea, according to the Kaesong business owners. . . .  \"Pyongyang responded to Seoul\u2019s decision in 2016 to suspend Kaesong operations by imposing military control over the site, freezing all assets of the Kaesong companies, and deporting the remaining South Korean managers and staff still there. . . .  \"The Kaesong association estimated its members left behind over $600 million in equipment and raw materials, and many of the Kaesong companies have been unable to recover . . .  \u201cThat's one of reasons why they want to reopen the complex. They sincerely want to reopen of the complex through immediate normalization of inter-Korean relations,\u201d said Kim with the Kaesong Industrial Complex Association. \"When Kaesong was shut down in 2016, the conservative government of then President Park Geun-hye claimed 70% of the $100 million in wages paid each year, which was given directly to the government in Pyongyang to distribute to the workers, was diverted to finance the North\u2019s illicit nuclear weapons program. However an official with the current pro-engagement administration of President Moon Jae-in has said there is no evidence that North Korea diverted Kaesong wages to its weapons programs.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  @amory 10.  It would be appreciated if GJ Admins would acknowledge that they were aware of what may be happening and why it does/doesn't satisfy this question. As events have unfolded, I have come to the conclusion that this situation is analogous to a gang breaking into a grocery store in its territory, taking over operation of the store, and declaring it open.  Such a scenario would not be considered a legal re-opening of the store; it would be considered an illegal looting even if the customers were paying for the merchandise.  Therefore while some factories may be operating, I'd say that Kaesong is not open. Does this situation bode well or ill for re-opening soon?  Clearly, SK businesses would like it to be re-opened, as, apparently, does the DPRK because of the foreign currency it gains through it, and the new SK government seems to be more pro-engagement.  So, I wouldn't be surprised if I started to read about negotiations to re-open it.  However, because of the increased sanctions and the possibility that DPRK is preparing to launch another missile, it may be politically very difficult to pull off.   And, thus far, the factory owners haven't even been able to inspect their property.   Another DPRK missile launch would kill it, I think.\n"], [368, "2017-10-13T23:50:49Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [1972, "2017-10-13T23:30:06Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [691, "2017-10-13T19:45:08Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [39938, "2017-10-13T09:46:43Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.9], ""], [368, "2017-10-12T19:10:59Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [28414, "2017-10-12T12:08:29Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [28414, "2017-10-12T12:08:11Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.8], ""], [37689, "2017-10-12T11:20:46Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [368, "2017-10-11T20:17:44Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [40652, "2017-10-11T07:35:09Z", [0.24, 0.51, 0.14, 0.06, 0.05], ""], [38, "2017-10-11T01:22:48Z", [0.5, 0.11, 0.02, 0.02, 0.35], ""], [368, "2017-10-10T18:46:58Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [23234, "2017-10-10T14:04:53Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.06, 0.91], ""], [28414, "2017-10-10T11:52:14Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [598, "2017-10-10T08:31:01Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.03, 0.97], ""], [368, "2017-10-09T20:32:37Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [12879, "2017-10-09T15:38:29Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [2965, "2017-10-09T14:22:17Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [28414, "2017-10-09T10:39:12Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [28414, "2017-10-09T08:29:55Z", [0.6, 0.4, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1639, "2017-10-09T05:29:04Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "https://amp.businessinsider.com/north-korea-restarts-work-at-kaesong-industrial-complex-2017-10 "], [31238, "2017-10-09T00:39:44Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [32122, "2017-10-09T00:09:09Z", [0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "At least the DPRK unilateral reopening will trigger negotiations to mutually reopen.

The main opposition Liberty Korea Party, in particular, called for a wholesale review of Moon's policy toward the provocative neighbor, stressing its Friday test of an intercontinental ballistic missile is reshaping the security landscape on the peninsula and beyond. \"The North's ICBM test is fundamentally changing the contours of security,\" Shim Jae-cheol, an LKP member and the National Assembly vice speaker, told Yonhap News Agency over the phone. \"We have to thoroughly review our policy.\"\n\"At a time when the international community seeks to achieve the North's denuclearization through pressure and sanctions, the pursuit of dialogue with the North would be ineffective. ... We fear it could rather cause misjudgment on the part of the North,\" Park said in a radio interview. Concerns about \"Korea passing\" have also emerged as Trump held phone talks first with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe over the North's latest missile test, with critics arguing that Seoul could be sidelined in security affairs involving the North. Capitalizing on public security concerns, the LKP redoubled its calls for the full-on deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery, a US missile defense system whose installation in the South has been suspended pending an environmental impact assessment. The ruling Democratic Party weighed in to defend the president, saying that the government would hold fast to its two-track approach of mixing dialogue and pressure, while it would sternly deal with the North's provocations. \"Even during wartime, dialogue continues,\" Kim Tae-nyeon, the DP policy chief, said. \"While building a robust defense system based on the South Korea-US alliance and applying sanctions and pressure, dialogue should also run in parallel.\" (Yonhap)\n"], [36686, "2017-08-04T16:35:57Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.35, 0.6], ""], [368, "2017-08-03T17:36:57Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [13377, "2017-08-03T15:03:42Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [12879, "2017-08-03T14:26:13Z", [0.01, 0.15, 0.25, 0.35, 0.24], ""], [691, "2017-08-03T12:10:42Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.01, 0.02, 0.96], ""], [29469, "2017-08-03T08:40:48Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.01, 0.98], "The current active missile programme and possible future nuclear tests, as well as DPRK's negative attitude towards the THAAD deployment, make this unlikely to happen any time soon."], [23355, "2017-08-03T08:25:41Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [19801, "2017-08-03T05:34:50Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.35, 0.6], "N.Korea Snubs Old Partner Hyundai Group\nPyongyang has also snubbed other overtures from the new administration in Seoul and South Korean civic groups in recent weeks.

Why it may re-open\n-it is a source of hard currency for DPRK, which needs it desperately\n-it has acted like a \"bridge\" between SK & DPRK\n-the new regime in SK seems eager to do anything and everything it can to keep channels of communication and interaction open with DPRK Why it may not open\n-It may be difficult to find interested businesses.  How many times can a business get yanked around and still be viable?  How many times has it been closed for political reasons almost overnight?  What would be the incentives for a business to be a part of it?  It was closed for 5 months in 2013, then open for about 30 months, then (now) closed since Feb 2016.  According to wikipedia, the 123 companies operating in Kaesong experienced losses equaling a combined \u00a3575 million ($944 million), during 5 months the last time it was closed.  What might the losses be this time, now that it has been closed for about 18 months? \n-international pressure may prevent it.  It seems to me that it would violate US & international sanctions. . . . U.S. economic sanctions against DPRK prohibit imports of key technologies and goods, such as computers\n-Who wants it to re-open?  and how much do they want it?  DPRK labor now costs more than it did when the park was created because of DPRK demands, so there's less profit to be made. \n-Will its re-opening be linked to some sort of sanctions relief for DPRK or agreement for DPRK to cease missile or nuke tests or for SK to not accept THAAD?    If so--and why wouldn't it be?--that will complicate/delay the re-opening.\n-talks would be complicated and difficult.
