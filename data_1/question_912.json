Xinhua reports an unknown number of homes and businesses were destroyed during two days of violence. -An \"organized group of youth\" attacked a celebration in the city of Awassa. Deaths were reported, but no figure is given.  -There have been reports of ethnically-motivated attacks in the Oromo region between the Oromo and Amhara groups. Details are not available. -Clashes were also reported in the Afar region between the Tigray and Afar groups. Details are not available.   The online Ethiopian news agency Borkena speculates that \"the power struggle within the ruling coalition might have pushed a certain faction from within to employ a strategy of manufacturing conflict so as to make the situation appear ungovernable to the new administration of Abiy Ahmed.\" These incidents remains mostly uncorroborated and vague. It would appear that it may be the case that organized groups are carrying out ethnically-motivated attacks targeting civilians, but the nature of the attacks, the level of organization and unity of the perpetrators, and the seemingly atomized, widespread nature of the attacks suggests that the level of violence does not yet rise to the level of resolving this question yet. More time is needed to monitor the situation to determine if these are one-off incidents or the start of a trend.  https://www.borkena.com/2018/06/12/ethnic-violence-now-affecting-gurage-in-central-ethiopia/ http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-06/14/c_137251988.htm https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/acleddata.com-Regional%20Overview%20%20Africa%2011%20June%202018.pdf https://www.borkena.com/2018/06/11/worsening-ethnic-conflict-in-guji-zone-left-at-least-75-dead/ -"], [172, "2018-06-13T22:39:04Z", [0.0], ""], [36132, "2018-06-12T14:50:23Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2018-06-11T12:53:56Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2018-06-08T12:55:35Z", [0.0], ""], [29033, "2018-06-06T20:51:25Z", [0.01], "Ethipoia has lifted its state of emergency two months earlier than expected.
