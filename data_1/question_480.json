While there may be resistance in the USA to requiring social media sites to be held responsible for their content, other countries (especially countries where the social media sites pay little tax and employ few people ) are likely to demand that similar rules are applied to social media as those applied to print media. This will would mean the social media sites would have to pay out large sums of money in fines or damages if they \"publish\" things such as fake news (and all types or other matter that is considered illegal in that country). The cost of ensuring that Twitter complies with the laws of all countries is likely to be higher than the revenue it can earn. In many ways online media is just following a similar path to other new media; first it spreads information free from control, then the authorities (and some citizens) realise that \"free speech\" needs be controlled. The only real argument is how much \"freedom\" and how much \"control\" is appropriate.

Almost every week there are demands that social media companies must remove links to terrorist sites, remove hate speech, remove links to copyright material, remove fake news, remove content that some group believes it anti-social for some reason.  In other words demands that social media companies are treated in a similar way to publishers.\nIn many respects this is to be expected as most types of new media are, in their early days, accused of disturbing society. Eventually laws are enacted to control the perceived abuses as society navigates it way between freedom of expression and censorship. \nThe difference with today's social media is that the scale of posts will make it very expensive for the sites to use people to judge if complainants have good cause to demand removal of offending posts . Eventually AI may be able provide editorial oversight. In the meantime governments that prioritize the rights of those who think they are being damaged by illegal content will not be very interested in how difficultly or expensive it is for the social media sites to control user content, and will fine the social media sites until they comply with new contend laws. \nObviously I do not know what the social media sites will do about it (e.g. they may be forced to \"know your customers\" so that the authorities can prosecute the users who post illegal material, or so that they can be sued by wronged people, or the social media sites may need the means of banning users that do not follow the rules, the social media may need to block different  posts in different legal jurisdictions.) But it seems pretty certain that many governments are going to crack down on the social media.

It has never made any profit. It cannot argue that it is growing market share and will be hugely profitable in the future, 2017 is the future. Assuming the board and shareholders are not totally incompetent, and that there is not some wondrous change likely to  boost its finances, it seems that Twitter does not actually have any value as an ongoing business. It has some value as a brand, but that is offset by a reputational problem. In order to comply with demands that all online media stop hosting hate posts, terrorist  propaganda, fake testimonials, fake news, scams, bullying etc. expensive controls will need to be put in place.  I believe that demands that online media police content will increase and this will add to the cost of operating (I am not making a judgement as to if this is justified, merely that particularly in Europe politicians are looking at big fines for social media that do not eliminate illegal content.)   My conclusion is that the only way anyone could make money from Twitter would be to reduce running costs, which would be very difficult to do while ensuring the material that is objected to is removed. The way to make money might be to liquidate it. I don't see Twitter have a value in the same way that a loss making newspaper would - in a newspaper the owner can push his/her view of the world, Twitter is the users views of the world. Maybe some e.g. D Trump would pay to post tweets, but I doubt that would be a viable business model (in case it is I will claim to have thought of it first; \"vanity tweets\". (hypocrisy alert; I am giving my views here, but I would not pay to post them).\nSo I don't see why anyone would want to buy a loss making company, that is likely to become more expensive to run.  I suspect the Twitter board think the company is worth more the amount of real assets it has.  But it looks like the board has realised that there is no way for them to turn it into a profitable company. So unless there is a mug with a lot of money to waste I don't see Twitter being sold."], [691, "2017-05-10T14:18:41Z", [0.5], ""], [1643, "2017-05-10T12:52:14Z", [0.1], "A list of possible acquirers: https://www.recode.net/2016/9/14/12876560/twitter-acquisition-options-google-facebook-apple Given the management trajectory, I would give an 80% chance that they are taken out at some point.  However, if I was a potential buyer I'm not sure if I have to do it this year.  Why not let TWTR management try out a few more cash generating ideas on their own dime before picking them up more cheaply?  Revenue is declining and there will most likely be an opportunity to pick them up later. My guess is that either Facebook ( they can bring in more advertising dollars via cross-promotions ) or a big telco ( another way to get timely streaming video in front of people and live the dream of being an app company ) eventually bats clean-up.  Peter Thiel is FB investor who backed Trump, thinks Twitter is a good asset and the management team is on drugs.
