The separatists are dependent on Russia and the fact of the primaries was just  to say \"If it is needed, we can organize and hold any elections in two-three weeks, with election campaign and all\". The elections is another matter - it is part of the Minsk agreement. And so far, the Minsk process was moving in Russia's interests. So, no elections were needed. But it all changed as the big picture changed: Alleppo and, to lesser extent, MH17 investigation. The most recent events - cancellation of Putin's visit to Paris and Germany's talk to impose new sanctions linked to Syria - put Minsk progress on jeopardy from Russia's point of view. So, to show the West its power now Russia can push for the Donetsk elections to embarrass the West, and Germany and France, in particular. Nothing prevents Russia then to get back to its previous position if Minsk process is resumed at earnest. The elections are scheduled for November 6, if I remember correctly. The preparation for them should start at least two weeks in advance. So for a week or so, I'll keep this 30% chance. If nothing is announced.

Such laws have not yet been passed and Ukraine has officially signaled that it does not plan to respect the agreement.

Elections in Donetsk were postponed not even once, but this time it looks different. This time the DNR announced two step system: first, primaries on October 2, and then the real elections (which in July were previously scheduled on November 6). Registration from September 13 to 17 led to more than 1000 (1095) candidates. http://riafan.ru/556571-doneck-gotovitsya-k-praimeriz-v-dnr-nachalas-predvybornaya-agitaciya (sorry, in Russian). The election commissions and boundaries are set up,  It looks eventual number of local parliament seats is 100 (at least it is the current number of seats in DNR: it\u2019s also 50 in LNR, but I am not sure do primaries include the other separatist republic or not). So it is roughly 10 to 1 candidates for primaries filter, which is quite a good competition.  In the last election two parties divided the parliament. So could we state we may expect democracy to win on November 6? Some doubts remain though. Firstly, why to have elections at all? In 2014 the parliaments in DNR and LNR (and actually, oddly, prime ministers as well) were elected for 4-year terms. Their time is not up yet. But these elections are part of the Minsk agreement between France, Germany, Ukraine and Russia, which were approved by separatists as well. Ukraine was supposed to change their laws and Constitution to accommodate separatists, then to have election under UKRANIAN laws, with control over borders going back to Ukraine. Ukraine does not want changes in the Constitution, as they would legitimize at least some of the demands of separatists who are considered terrorists. Hence, Ukraine talks about lack of safety there and \u201coccupation\u201d by Russia. Russia wants a thorn in Ukrainian side, one way or another, and Donbas government under their full control (one way or another). They want constitutional changes to incapacitate Ukraine. And, most of all, they want this as a part of settlement with the West. There is no real need for Russia for these elections to proceed without the latter.  So these elections are absurd without recognition by Ukraine. There have been some movements for grand settlement between Russia and the West \u2013 Putin talked to Merkel, Obama and Hollande on G20 sidelines, Germans and the French visited Kiev, but so far nothing out of it.  So despite all these pronouncements, I personally do not think  this is legit. Just for the show\u2026 But who am I?

From todays WSJ Editorial page- http://www.wsj.com/articles/putins-ukraine-games-1471993315\n\"Ukraine marks a quarter century of independence from the Soviet Union on Wednesday, and Vladimir Putin\u2019s idea of a birthday gift is to mass troops on its border. This could be a gambit to force a new round of diplomatic concessions from the West\u2014or the prelude to another war. The Kremlin\u2019s buildup includes deploying the S-400 air-defense system in Crimea and air and naval assets in the Black Sea, while conducting tank exercises in the Russian-occupied strip of Moldovan territory called Transnistria. In May the Kremlin formed a new motorized rifle division in Russia\u2019s western Rostov region, which borders Ukraine\u2019s separatist regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. Mr. Putin has also refused to grant the Kiev government control over its eastern borders, as he was required to do under last year\u2019s Minsk II Agreement. As a result, he can reinforce his proxies in eastern Ukraine with troops, materiel and missiles of the sort that brought down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in 2014. Then there is the Kremlin\u2019s rhetoric. Moscow earlier this month accused Ukraine of dispatching saboteurs to Crimea in an attempt to destabilize the peninsula ahead of Russian parliamentary \u201celections\u201d next month. The accusation suggests a classic Russian disinformation operation. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has said a military mobilization is possible and warned the West not to rule out a \u201cfull-scale Russian invasion\u201d of his country. That makes Washington\u2019s blas\u00e9 reaction all the more dangerous. The Pentagon believes the Russian buildup is a routine drill, though drills have been used historically as covers for invasion. Meanwhile, Vice President Joe Biden urged both sides to show restraint in a call Friday with Mr. Poroshenko, as if Kiev is guilty of any provocation except self-defense. President Obama has refused to provide Ukraine with the kinds of defensive arms that might deter the Russians. All of this recalls Russia\u2019s invasion of Georgia in August 2008, which took place as another American President was about to leave office. History may not repeat itself, but the West has given Mr. Putin little reason for pause if he does have designs on more Ukraine territory this year.\" I agree 100% it certainly does not portend elections before 1-1-2017\n does it portend a new Russian invasion?  \""], [61, "2016-08-24T14:16:20Z", [0.0, 0.23, 0.77], "Ukraine seemingly getting pressure to make it happen yet remaining resolute to mitigate Russian interference.

Ukrainian officials say the sabotage mission is pure \u201cfantasy,\u201d arguing the Kremlin is likely to use it as a pretext for a major escalation of the two-year-long conflict in east Ukraine, where Moscow-backed forces were occupying a large chunk of the Donbas region, including the cities of Donetsk and Luhansk. By August 2016, the conflict had killed 10,000 people since it began in April 2014. While casualties have continued at a much reduced level since spring 2015, by mid-2016 both sides returned to using heavy artillery, including howitzers and \u2018Grad\u2019 multiple rocket launchers. In July 2016, the United Nations reported that eight died and 65 were injured.
