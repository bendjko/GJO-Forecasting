On the other hand, and even predating this outburst, the killings were certainly being done in a more or less coordinated way by people who wanted to please him.  There is, I suspect, no rational way to score this, which has been the problem with the Philippines question all along:  Either people doing the president's bidding are one \"armed group,\" since they are acting as his minions;  or each individual police agency is counted separately.

Okay, everybody let\u2019s rehash some of the indicators for genocide prediction. The biggest indicator of genocide happening is previous genocides happening without changes of policies.  What do we need for a mass atrocities to be a Genocide? \nState led killings of civilians that are deliberate \nThe civilians are grouped\nKillings need to be organized\nThere has to be a great number of people who are killed (over 1000) I\u2019m not going to get into the nitty gritty on this part, the targeted group are drug users and cartels and the actors are the police.  List of indicators for genocides that I am looking for\nGenocide\nPolicies that single out groups of people \nHate speech \nPolitical Leaders being dickheads  Past Genocides:\nDuterte was inaugurated in 2016, between the dates of June 30th, 2016 to March 2017, an estimated 5000 people have died due to Duterte\u2019s war on drugs [1]. Using ACLEDdata as a source, this equates to approximately 285 acts of violence against civilians from police and military forces of the Philippines [2]. As a note, Acts of Violence are not distinguished from people who have died and people who have been hurt.   Base Rate: Subsection of Past Genocides\nThat\u2019s the past, let\u2019s talk about now.  Between 1st of January, 2018 and the 31st of August, 2018. There were 365 events from the Police Forces of the Philippines. [2]. That\u2019s an indicator that a genocide is possible from the state of the Philippines.  Continuing the trend of the policies. \nWhat would it take for the policies to continue? What would it take for the policies to stop.  Duterte needs to be in office \nDuterte won\u2019t detract his own policies\nDetractors from the policies can\u2019t be in his way President Duterte\u2019s policies of killing drug users has been something that he has been associated while he was the Mayor in Davao city [3]. And he\u2019s continuing to make statements about bloodshed continuing the bloodshed in the country [4].  He has also jailed politicians who have detracted from his position on the killings[5]. With previous history of past killings in Davao City, the statement, and jailings continuing, I find it unlikely that Duterte will detract from the genocides.  Other Indicators:\nDuterte commonly refers to the drug users and the cartel in a derogatory manner, which counts as hate speech. (I also think this is an overrated indicator) [5].  There is enough information here to see that the killings will continue at least until the end of the year.  All things considered, I\u2019d say there is an 80 percent chance of genocide before the end of the year.

According to Human Rights Watch's 'World Report 2018' released in the beginning of this year, President Duterte\u2019s extrajudicial war on drugs that began in June 2016, had resulted in the killing of more than 12,000 drug suspects by the end of 2017 (i.e. 12,000 civilians systematically killed by armed groups - as defined above - over 1.5 years). We do not know if the death toll is continuing at that rate. However, there are factors/developments that can drive a significantly high death rate.  In addition to the open-source information shared by cdob63, other media reports in June 2018 indicated that President Rodrigo Duterte (after consulting with the police and intelligence community) said he was considering arming community leaders, known as 'barangay' captains, with handguns. The intention is to mobilise the country's barangay captains to help fight crime and drugs. President Duterte said that  he vowed to provide the same legal protection to barangay captains as he did soldiers or police, and they \u201cwill never go to jail\u201d if they shot suspected criminals in the performance of their duty. There are currently 42,000 barangay captains in the country. The handguns would be provided for free, or private purchases subsidized. If the Duterte administration implements this policy, we can expect not only more gun-related violence in the Philippines but also the basis for the systematic killing of 1,000 or more civilians in the Philippines.  https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/01/18/philippines-dutertes-drug-war-claims-12000-lives\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-crime/philippines-aims-to-arm-community-leaders-to-help-fight-crime-drugs-idUSKBN1J90Q2\nhttp://news.abs-cbn.com/news/06/14/18/law-allows-barangay-chiefs-to-carry-guns-dilg-official\nhttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/06/13/pledge-arm-philippine-community-chiefs-sparks-wild-west-fears/"], [691, "2018-07-30T11:57:32Z", [0.41], "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-drugs/philippine-police-vow-surgical-and-chilling-war-on-drugs-crime-idUSKBN1KK0Z9?il=0 According to this story, the police have already identified almost 900 people they're planning to kill without bothering with trials and such.
