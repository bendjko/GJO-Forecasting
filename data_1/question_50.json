However, today's surprise announcement from the Japanese government seems to be fiscal stimulus, not monetary QE.  Even though the package appears to include ETF purchases, it looks like a Cabinet budget measure, not a BOJ announcement.  No bonds are issued to be hoovered up by BOJ.  I could be wrong, but this looks like budgetary spending/stimulus, not addtional QE.     TOKYO, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Japan's cabinet approved on Friday a $27 billion extra budget for the current fiscal year ending in March to revitalize growth in the world's third-largest economy. The 3.3213 trillion yen ($27.12 billion) extra stimulus budget features spending for steps to support the low-income elderly with cash benefits worth 30,000 yen per person and farmers hit by the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal. The extra budget adds to the initial outlay of 96.3 trillion yen, bringing the total amount of this fiscal year's general-account budget spending to 99.6 trillion yen. It compared with a 3.1 trillion yen extra budget spending for the last fiscal year. The budget underscores a challenge to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who must strike the right balance between fixing the industrial world's heaviest public debt burden and reviving the economy ahead of the upper house election around mid-2016. Japan narrowly dodged recession in the third quarter due to upward revision to capital expenditures and inventory, but any rebound is seen modest due to soft demand at home and overseas. To stick to fiscal discipline, the government will not issue extra bonds to fund the stimulus. It reduced its plans to issue new bonds by 444.7 billion yen from the initially planned 36.9 trillion yen for the current fiscal year. The government will tap sources such as unspent money from the previous year's budget and tax revenue that has exceeded initial budget forecasts."], [12630, "2015-12-18T18:19:41Z", [0.0], ""], [3514, "2015-12-18T17:20:44Z", [0.6], ""], [3514, "2015-12-18T16:39:14Z", [1.0], ""], [532, "2015-12-18T16:33:35Z", [0.0], ""], [3514, "2015-12-18T16:20:19Z", [0.6], "Unfortunately cant figure out how to respond to specific comments given all my browser extensions: \"even 60pc implies you think yes there will be another announcement if this one doesnt count. Again, up to you. You status as a trader makes me think you have a better understanding on this than me as to whether this counted as an increase in asset purchases as part of QE or just an expansion of the QE programme. You and @RJM seem confident it meets both criteria, @Jean-Pierre seems to think only the latter. Must confess, completely out of my depth now. Will have to trust the outcome is fair.

If the question were, \"Does Kuroda say there was an announced increase in asset purchases,\" I would respond with \"no.\"  If the question were \"was there a \"significant\" increase in asset purchases...\" I would respond with \"probably not.\"  Since the question is whether there is actually and literally any announced increase in asset purchases, my answer is yes, since the purchases of J-REITs and ETFs, both assets, has increased.  Since the increase was relatively small, and I don't know how GJP comes out when the answer is literally yes but relatively small and they'll probably be swayed by how everyone else seems to be voting, then I guess I should hedge w/ an answer less than 100%. As for the role of central bankers, I still recall when Bernanke was asked at a FOMC conference whether gold was money, to which he flatly responded \"no.\"  After the balancing act of growth vs inflation, the secondary job description of a central banker is to ensure people maintain trust in their fiat currency and to try to prevent speculators from jumping into obvious fundamental positions against the bank, which is where their political nature shines.  I bet against the words of central bankers all the time and win.  That's what most of the best global macro traders in history have done.

In this case, because markets sold the news, some journalist will rationalize it as \"not an increase.\" As for the increase in avg duration for the JGB purchases, the QE effect of that duration extension is actually to strengthen QE, as the duration weighted purchases are now significantly increased, even though the net increase in purchases is not literally increased.  The longer the term for a bond, the more volatile its price movements relative to yield changes (the definition of duration), and the bigger the creditor's commitment for a given nominal amount lent.  In other words, what's scarier when you lend money, when you agree to get repaid tomorrow, or when you agree to get repaid in 10 years?

Someone else said they need reform, which is true, but not politically easy and should already have been done but hasn't, and leadership isn't changing, w/ Abe around for awhile still.  Even if they do execute structural reform, easing should be done in conjunction until it appears deflation has been avoided and some semblance of inflation arrives.  The world is basically already in or entering a recession now, so Japan needs some sort of easing.  So the BOJ can take interest rates negative or increase equity purchases, or both, if it wants to ease.  I think they need to ease monetarily somehow.  So the question for me basically is whether they will buy more equities or not before the end of the year.  However, if they purchase equities, this will probably be done through the GPIF, which is not technically the BOJ.  So this makes my choice very easy.

Generally, it's expected that the eurozone and Japan (the two main non-U.S. developed markets for bond investors) will be relying on quantitative easing much longer than the United States, thus delaying their own rate hikes. But the market for high-quality non-U.S. government bonds, including German bunds and Japanese government bonds, can track U.S. Treasuries when investors seek safe-haven assets. If the Fed continues to delay the rate hike, it could be seen as a signal that it's concerned about economic growth and may stoke fears of slowing global growth, and German and Japanese government bonds could strengthen. Under the same scenario, the dollar is likely to weaken, which would boost issues denominated in euros or yen.
