India is \"also supporting the conspiracies being hatched by Afghanistan against Pakistan\", isn't giving any response to \"Pakistan's peace initiatives\" and is, like Afghanistan, involved in a \"blame game\" with Islamabad as the target, said Khawaja Asif, Pakistan's new foreign minister. In his first press conference since being appointed foreign minister, Asif also reportedly said that \"Pakistan's desire for peace and good relations with neighbours should not be construed as its weakness.\"... Asif made no comment about India's allegation that Pakistan is constructing six dams on the Indus river in Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir with China's assistance, as Minister of State for External Affairs V K Singh said in a written reply+ in Rajya Sabha  last week. The Indian government has in fact issued demarches to both Islamabad and Beijing over the constructions stating that it is in violation of India's sovereignty and territorial integrity.

More than 100 projects under construction\u2014over 40 since last year\u2014and others in development will yield at least a tenfold increase in the next decade to 10 gigawatts of power, they say. \u201cThere\u2019s such an energy shortage that any project you build will find a market,\u201d said Allard Nooy, CEO of InfraCo Asia, a development body funded by the U.K., Swiss and Australian governments that is financing one hydro project and seeking to develop two more. Still, power companies don\u2019t face an easy ride. Among the hurdles are natural ones: earthquakes, landslides and inland tsunamis from glacial lakes as warmer temperatures prompt ice melt. Two years ago a series of massive quakes killed 9,000 people and shattered the country. Opposition from environmental groups is another difficulty, especially for a new generation of dam projects. In the past, the World Bank and Japan\u2019s Asian Development Bank have withdrawn support for projects amid opposition from environmental groups that say large dams can damage natural habitats like wetlands, threaten migratory fish stocks, and displace traditional farming communities. The risks are also political. Instability has led to 21 leaders in the past 20 years. A decade-long civil war killed more than 16,000 people and ravaged the economy. But since the war ended in 2006, armed rebels have mainly swapped violence for politics. On Sunday, the poor nation of 30 million people held peaceful local elections, the first in decades, a vital step toward building a more stable democracy. The greater stability has boosted momentum for rising investment in the Himalayas\u2014a region dominated by Nepal, India and Bhutan that is considered the final development frontier in South Asia. Hydro energy projects are the biggest focus. \u201cThe only resource we have, like the Arabian countries have oil, is water,\u201d said Chhabi Gaire, project manager at the Rasuwagadhi Hydroelectric Project, a 111-megawatt plant under construction near China\u2019s border (para. 1-12).

The banners add: \u201cOur friendship is higher than the Himalayas and deeper than the deepest sea in the world, and sweeter than honey.\u201d That high, deep and sweet friendship is also worth a lot of money. The CPEC scheme, which will link western China to the Arabian Sea through Pakistan, is a cornerstone of the ambitious \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d, a 65-nation strong initiative that aims to create a modern Silk Road connecting the world\u2019s second-largest economy with Central Asia, Europe and Africa. It is the pet project of Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president, who described the infrastructure-driven scheme this week as \u201cthe project of the century\u201d when he met heads of state to discuss progress. On the surface, Pakistan is on schedule to be one of the largest beneficiaries of Mr Xi\u2019s ambition and arguably no country has as much to gain. Growth in gross domestic product is running at close to 5 per cent a year but it is not enough to absorb the 2m to 3m people entering the job market annually. \u201cPakistan has not been part of the world for a long time,\u201d says Khurram Dastgir Khan, the commerce minister. \u201cWe were in a dark bubble and we are only just emerging.

[But] China is the only game in town.\u201d Such concerns are an acknowledgment that Pakistan\u2019s economy has struggled, not only when compared with neighboring India but also against the likes of Bangladesh, which has built a large manufacturing base. Beijing is set to invest more than $55bn in its neighbor, building power plants, roads and railways to give its infrastructure a much-needed upgrade as it seeks to emerge from years of political instability. Estimates from the Pakistan Business Council suggest the projects could account for 20 per cent of the country\u2019s GDP over the next five years and boost growth by about 3 percentage points. But Pakistan\u2019s policymakers also hope the relationship \u2014 Beijing last month provided more than $1bn in loans to help Islamabad stave off a currency crisis \u2014 will insulate it from the possibility that China will use its investments as a way to grab resources, profits and political power from its smaller, poorer neighbor (para. 1-7).

Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s drive to bring homes to the country\u2019s 1.3 billion people, rising incomes and the best affordability in two decades will unleash a $1.3 trillion wave of investment in housing over the next seven years, according to CLSA India Pvt. The firm expects 60 million new homes to be built between 2018 and 2024, creating about 2 million jobs annually and giving a tailwind of as much as 75 basis points to India\u2019s gross domestic product. The volume of social and affordable housing will rise almost 70 percent to 10.5 million annually by 2024, exceeding the 33 percent increase in the premium market. \u201cThe housing sector is at a tipping point and will be the economy\u2019s next big growth driver,\u201d Mumbai-based analyst Mahesh Nandurkar and his colleagues wrote in a note last week. \u201cThe catalyst is the government\u2019s big push for an ambitious housing program.\u201d Modi has been on a mission to expand affordable housing in Asia\u2019s third-largest economy. In February, the government granted affordable-housing builders \u201cinfrastructure status,\u201d making them eligible for state incentives, subsidies, tax benefits and institutional funding. In June 2015, it announced a \u201cHousing for All\u201d program which aims to construct 20 million homes across the country and in December it announced rebates and interest waivers for home loans under the program. That\u2019s not all that\u2019s expected to fan demand. In the past five years, mortgage rates have dropped about 275 basis points to about 8.5 percent. Prices have remained stable while per-capita incomes have posted a compound annual growth rate of about 10 percent, according to the CLSA note. While India\u2019s real estate industry extended a slump after Modi\u2019s sudden decision to ban 86 percent of the nation\u2019s cash in November, affordable housing was growing the fastest before demonetization and the whole market has shown signs of snapping back (para. 1-8).

As per latest developments, it has been learnt that India has practically waged water war on Pakistan. India has accelerated construction of 100 dams along rivers that flow into Pakistan, thus, blatantly violating the Indus Water Treaty and international laws. International watchdogs have not taken any notice yet. Well-informed sources have revealed that India has completed preparations for construction of 24 hydro power projects on Chenab river, 52 on Jhelum river and 18 on Sindh river. The World Bank (WB) has also granted loan to India for construction of hydro power projects. In this pretext, if India bars water movement on Marala Head-works, Pakistan would lose 10 million acre rice production area. India has completed Phase-I of controversial Baglihar Dam on Chenab river. The 450MW Baglihar Dam is consuming 430 cusecs of water. Similarly, 690MW Salal Hydroelectric Power Station is consuming 14,550 cusecs of river water whereas 780MW Dul Hasti Hydroelectric Plant is consuming 7,522 cusecs of river water. In the meantime, India is rapidly summing up construction activities on 1200MW Sawalkot Dam, 1020MW Pakal Dul Dam, 560MW Ratle Dam, 1020MW Bharsar Hydro power project, 370MW Shamnot Hydro power project among several others notable projects in a bid to create worse water shortage in Pakistan in coming years. Several other hydroelectric projects, including Gyspa, Chattru, Shangling, Miyarm Tandi, Seli, Reoli Dugli, Bardang, Patam, Tinget and Purthi, are coming up in the ecologically vulnerable region of Himachal Pradesh but on Chenab river. Analysts call for concrete measures to counter Indian water aggression. Regrettably, no noticeable hydropower projects has been erected by Pakistan in the last two decades (para. 1-7).
