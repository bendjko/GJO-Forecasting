Socialist lawmakers then voted against Rajoy\u2019s candidacy in confidence votes on Aug. 31 and Sept. 2, in line with Sanchez\u2019s public pledges at the time. . . . \u201c. . . . Gonzalez told Cadena Ser radio on Wednesday. \u201cHe told me he would do one thing and then did the complete opposite.\u201d \"Ousting Sanchez may help end the nine-month deadlock that has paralyzed Spanish politics since the PP lost its majority in December when a first round of elections was held. If the rebels have their way, the party would likely appoint a temporary administrator who would then lead an abstention to let Rajoy take office. Andalusian President Susana Diaz is the most likely successor in the longer term.\n. . . \n\"The Socialist leader is trying to hang on until a meeting of the party\u2019s federal committee on Saturday to present a plan to form an alternative government to Rajoy. Such a move would require support from anti-austerity group Podemos, which has captured much of the Socialist vote since emerging two years ago, as well as smaller separatist parties from Catalonia. Both alliances would sit uneasily for many Socialists.\n. . . \n\"Sanchez has called for the party to hold a leadership election on Oct. 23 in a bid to flush out his opponents. While senior officials are pushing for a compromise to let Rajoy take office, their leader is betting that his stance would still win the backing of the rank-and-file membership. \"The pressure on Sanchez increased after the Socialists suffered losses in regional elections in Galicia and Basque Country on Sunday, falling behind Podemos in both ballots. Sanchez has posted the worst result in the Socialists\u2019 history in both of the general elections he\u2019s fought. Diaz, who runs the Socialists\u2019 stronghold in southern Spain, hinted Tuesday about a challenge to Sanchez.\n. . .\n\"Other Socialists leaders, including the regional presidents of Extremadura and Castilla-La Mancha have urged Sanchez to reconsider his stance. \n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  If this question is re-launched with another closing date, this information might be pertinent, however, because this question closes in 2 days, it's not.\n"], [1646, "2016-09-28T16:24:47Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-09-28T12:47:19Z", [0.0], ""], [23409, "2016-09-28T07:34:07Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2016-09-28T05:29:25Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-09-28T01:08:35Z", [0.0], ""], [21046, "2016-09-28T00:13:10Z", [0.0], ""], [23006, "2016-09-28T00:02:34Z", [0.2], ""], [1639, "2016-09-27T20:18:33Z", [0.0], "Adjusting downwards for passing of time "], [15477, "2016-09-27T18:53:41Z", [0.05], ""], [268, "2016-09-27T18:27:37Z", [0.0], ""], [28893, "2016-09-27T18:23:12Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2016-09-27T05:58:54Z", [0.0], ""], [28380, "2016-09-27T05:45:59Z", [0.1], "right. previous was way to positive and i forgot to adjust"], [29266, "2016-09-27T02:51:32Z", [0.0], ""], [38, "2016-09-27T01:41:47Z", [0.0], "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/spains-regional-elections-reaffirm-rajoy-in-galicia/Acting Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy\u2019s conservative Popular Party got a boost in regional elections Sunday, while the opposition Socialists lost ground. \"Residents of the Basque and Galicia regions voted in elections for 75-seat regional parliaments, but the results failed to indicate a clear path forward to ending the country\u2019s prolonged political stalemate.\n. . . \n\"The Socialist Party lost seats in both regions.

In mid-July, I started as an optimist, believing that the PSOE cannot afford to be blamed for causing new elections and will yield, probably by a few abstentions. However, at that time I didn't know (i) about the regional elections on Sep 25, and (ii) that even if the Aug 31-Sep 2 attempt to form a government fails, there will be another chance (by Oct 31) to form a government before new elections are triggered. The turning point for me was the PSOE leadership decision to wait out the regional elections. Then I realized that a government before that will be seen as a defeat for the PSOE, so they cannot afford to allow that (unless there were a revolt, but this didn't happen).  I wonder if there will be another question on whether  a government will be formed by October 31. I believe this will depend on the PSOE showing in the Galicia/Basque country elections. A strong showing may tempt them to go for new national elections, even though this will be a risky decision. A weak showing should normally force them to acquiesce and allow 11 abstentions. But this may be the end of Sanchez and others as leaders, so they may fight it.

However, with the centre-right Popular Party declining in popularity (ironically...), a left-wing bloc could well command close to 50% support. The left-wing parties are much more likely  than the right-wing PP to do a deal with the Catalan and/or Basque nationalist parties, which *could* give them enough support for a working government (albeit at some cost - the nationalists are likely to drive a hard bargain, and are less concerned than the others about the political process stalling, since this ultimately aids their cause).  It is also possible that the centrist 'Ciudadanos' party may hold the balance of power. They have been polling a solid 15% of late, and have some momentum. Importantly, 'Ciudadanos' may countenance a political alliance with either the left-bloc, or with the PP, making the formation of a government more likely still. Both Left and Right would probably rather bring C's in to the government than the nationalists (and C's are likely to have many more seats, and so make more useful coalition partners). Moreover, all the main leaders have acknowledged that another election is the least desirable option. Spain effectively 'shuts down' for August - businesses close, and many Spaniards go on holiday. An election during this month would be very unlikely. That means that, if there is to be another election in the short term, it would have to take place in July; coming so soon after the previous poll, this would be unlikely to produce a better outcome. The formation of a government (and, therefore, a successful vote of confidence) seems the most likely outcome at this stage. However, Spanish politics is notoriously unpredictable. Podemos, moreover, has no record in government, and significant ideological dissonance on the Left may be enough to stall a deal, especially if it is not struck quickly. The nationalist element is also important here - both Left and Right have deep-seated anxieties about the nationalist parties, and any attempt to include them in a government may be enough to ignite wider tensions. The longer negotiations take, the more likely it is that a vote of confidence would fail, especially if public opinion seems to be turning against the Left; therefore, I will consider revising this prediction down in a week if no government has been successfully formed by then."], [21046, "2016-06-23T22:40:21Z", [0.85], ""], [12302, "2016-06-23T18:29:24Z", [0.75], ""], [691, "2016-06-23T16:04:51Z", [0.44], ""], [19801, "2016-06-23T12:27:33Z", [0.65], "It\u2019s even less likely that Spain will face a third election.

This means no party has enough to form a government on its own, and more importantly no two left parties or right parties (categorizing Cuidadanos as right since they are to the right of Podemos and PSOE) have enough to form a government together. This leaves two possibilities:\n\n1- Things change in the next two weeks and either the left or the right \"surges\" ahead to get more than 50% of the seats. Let's assign this event a 40% chance.  If it's the right surging ahead (20% of the total), I think it would be easier for PP and Cuidadanos to either form a coalition or to have a PP government propped up by Cuidadanos (15% of the total). Otherwise if it's the left surging ahead (20%), it could be a little harder since chances are PSOE will have to be the junior partner unless Podemos concedes (10%? of the total). In short, while I'm assigning a 40% chance of a left or right tilt, I'm only assigning a 25% chance that this leads to a government.  2- Things stay the same and neither the left nor right surges (60%). Then, it's tough. Will they repeat the election a third time? I would say that's unpalatable to all parties involved. On the other hand, there is no way that the right coalition supports a Podemos led government (1%). It is also hard to imagine that the PSOE would be allowed to form a government as the third place finishers (2%).   Would the PSOE join a PP led government? or would they support it (PP or PP/C's) from the outside? That was a non-starter with the current prime minister, but could they change their minds, or could the PP's have a leadership coup to change the prime-minister and facilitate forming a government (10%)? Summing things up, I'm at 25+1+2+10, and let's round up to 40 for good measure, and to account for the fact that there would be pressure to form a government.
