Now, let's see this from McConnell's perspective:\n- the resolution dies anyway (whether by an under-60-votes-threshold vote, a lack of vote due to a filibuster, or by a regular-threshold-vote and a veto), so the question is who gets what out of the process itself;\n- I suppose it's more important for him to let Republican Senators go on record voting against the deal rather than just embarrass Reid and the White House at any price;\n- a successful filibuster denies the Republicans a chance to go on record;\n- while a yes/no vote gives them exactly that opportunity. So if the filibuster threat seems credible, it might be better for McConnell not to call Reid's bluff and just set up a 60-votes-threshold yes/no vote.\nAt this point, it does not seem credible to me - there are some of the undecided Democrats that might announce not just against the filibuster, but against the deal itself (Blumenthal, Peters, Wyden).

U.S. Republicans now are promoting an end run around the Iran nuclear deal that is apparently designed to persuade Iran to reject the agreement. The concept is for U.S. states to impose new sanctions against Iran in addition to the existing sanctions, primarily divestments similar to those imposed against South Africa during the era of apartheid.
