If Congress balks, Mr. Bannon has advised the president to issue a veto, which would trigger a government shutdown.\n~~~~~~\n from Politico playbook\n\"The debt ceiling needs to be lifted this fall, and government funding runs dry at the end of September. In his interview with the Weekly Standard, Bannon was more publicly clear-eyed about White House-Capitol Hill dynamics than anyone who works in the Trump administration. He said Trump will \u201csign a clean debt ceiling\u201d and will do a \u201cvery standard Republican version of taxes\u201d -- the \u201cstandard marginal tax cut.\u201d Bannon is voicing what many Republicans tell us behind the scenes. Needless to say, Bannon thinks this is a cop out. And it seems painfully obvious Breitbart will rally against this, causing serious headaches for Republican leaders with a lot on the line.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  These reports seem somewhat contradictory.

There has been recent reporting that Democrats may be trying to tie the debt ceiling vote to blocking tax cuts (https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-06-03/democrats-weigh-using-debt-ceiling-debate-to-thwart-gop-tax-cuts) and that the Freedom Caucus is looking to do the opposite with attaching spending cuts (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/06/01/trump-white-house-rejects-conservative-push-for-debt-ceiling-collision/?utm_term=.ae1ea6fbe5b3).  However, like AHCA, I believe there will be enough political pressure for Republicans to pass the measure themselves, at least in the House.  In the last 3 votes, Democrats have contributed a large number of votes in raising the ceiling (see previous WP link), and I see some chance (10%) in them taking a significant stand, but again, with political pressure, I think both parties will be forced to raise/suspend it."], [34353, "2017-06-04T15:58:57Z", [0.99], ""], [35217, "2017-06-04T15:49:16Z", [0.99], ""], [4660, "2017-06-04T15:41:36Z", [0.9], ""], [4660, "2017-06-04T15:40:58Z", [0.6], ""], [4066, "2017-06-03T21:28:29Z", [0.85], ""], [14847, "2017-06-03T21:08:14Z", [0.89], ""], [368, "2017-06-03T18:09:07Z", [1.0], ""], [34353, "2017-06-03T16:26:37Z", [0.99], ""], [35618, "2017-06-02T23:36:31Z", [1.0], ""], [35838, "2017-06-02T22:59:54Z", [0.98], ""], [35031, "2017-06-02T21:44:38Z", [0.98], ""], [368, "2017-06-02T19:41:37Z", [1.0], ""], [35893, "2017-06-02T11:17:50Z", [0.95], ""], [34353, "2017-06-02T11:07:56Z", [0.99], ""], [25655, "2017-06-02T07:50:57Z", [1.0], ""], [368, "2017-06-01T17:11:27Z", [1.0], ""], [25655, "2017-06-01T17:05:57Z", [1.0], ""], [34353, "2017-06-01T11:24:11Z", [0.99], ""], [691, "2017-06-01T11:22:55Z", [0.99], ""], [35814, "2017-06-01T10:13:38Z", [0.98], "The only reason I can think of that the ceiling will not be raised, suspended or even abolished would be an attempt by some representatives holding a grudge.
