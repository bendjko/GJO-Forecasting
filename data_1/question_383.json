a new electoral system that is expected to handicap the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement at a forthcoming national election and favor mainstream political blocs.  The bill has already been approved by the lower house thanks to a battery of confidence motions that swept aside all opposition and now only needs a green light from the head of state to become law. This is expected in the coming days. The voting system, a mix of proportional representation and first-past-the-post, will benefit parties that form pre-election coalitions -- something the 5-Star has always ruled out. With opinion polls pointing to a three-way split between the centre-left, centre-right and 5-Star, analysts say the new electoral law will not produce a clear-cut winner at the next election, which is due by May 2018.\""], [691, "2017-10-26T20:26:05Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [368, "2017-10-26T18:31:12Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [368, "2017-10-25T23:52:50Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0,

He blamed the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, saying they had \"killed off\" the deal. Italian assets gained on signs the accord was failing, with government bond yields falling and stocks rising as investors bet the breakdown of the accord would reduce the risk of a snap election this year. However, some politicians predicted that the row could make a vote in 2017 more likely, saying the government might decide to circumvent a divided parliament and introduce a new electoral system by decree. Italy's main parties -- the PD, 5-Star, Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia and the right-wing Northern League -- agreed last week that they would all support a proportional representation system based on the German electoral model. However, as soon as voting on the bill began in the lower house this week, the agreement began to look shaky. On Wednesday some 60 parliamentarians opposed it in secret ballots, with the PD and 5-Star blaming each other for the defections.\nFiano declared the deal dead on Thursday after an amendment, opposed by the PD, regarding elections in the autonomous northern region of Trentino Alto-Adige, was passed in a secret vote. PD lawmakers said the 5-Star had backed the measure. Alessandro Di Battista, one of 5-Star's most prominent deputies, accused the PD of wanting to scupper the new electoral law and using the Trentino vote as a pretext. \"For us the pact is still valid, we are in favor of this bill,\" he told reporters.\nVoting on the bill was suspended and the PD, Forza Italia and the Northern League convened meetings of their executive bodies to decide the next step. The Northern League called for a new electoral law to be introduced by emergency decree so that a snap vote could be held, and PD spokesman Matteo Richetti also suggested it would be better to go to the polls quickly. \"If parliament ... can't agree on an electoral law it's hard to argue that the legislature can carry on,\" he said.

Neither Mattarella nor Gentilloni can prevent that just because they want to.

But this is not guaranteed, as the draft law can be amended or he can change his mind. Anyway, 2018 warrants now only a small probability in my view. Differentiating between Q3 and Q4 is tougher. Given the situation with the electoral law, Sep 24 seems just about the only date in Q3 that may work. But this is Renzi's preferred date, and Grillo doesn't mind it either.

The Italians seem to have agreed on a form of voting that the three main parties are willing to support. But this agreement obviously makes the risk of early vote more likely. Of course there is still that pesky problem of EU budget deadlines\u2026\n\u201cItaly will not only adopt the German voting system, but may even end up voting on the same day - September 24 - or possibly a week earlier, as La Republica writes this morning\u201d \n\u201cFrankfurter Allgemeine\u2019s Rome correspondent sees a financial crisis coming up in the autumn because it will be impossible for the new government to agree on a 2018 budget in time. The article argues that both Renzi and Luigi Di Maio, the Five Star\u2019s top parliamentarian, both want early elections because they do not want to be bound by the 2018 austerity budget that would otherwise be decided for them by the current administration.\u201d\nhttps://www.eurointelligence.com/public.html\nSo it appears that my initial thoughts that the budget process was a reason to pause on elections was wrong. In fact, Five Start and Renzi may both want to hold earlier elections in order to get ahead of the budget process, even if that means missing the October deadline\nBut\u2026\nItalian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said parliament should decide between a general election as early as September or wait until the end of the legislature at the beginning of next year to hold fresh elections.\nhttp://www.politico.eu/article/italy-election-renzi-paolo-gentiloni-early-elections-should-not-disrupt-eu-commitments/\nBut it\u2019s not really up to him, it\u2019s Matarella. And most commentators believe that Matarella does not want to risk messing up the budget process, especially when there is a risk of either a M5S/LN coalition, or a PD/FI coalition, or a hung parliament. FWIW I appreciate that M5S has said they won\u2019t engage in any alliances but if they are that close to taking power they may change their tune.\nI think the framing of this question makes it a little hard. If September/October is the time frame then having the cut-off be September forces one to spread their bets across those two dates. I think that if they can\u2019t get the voting law approved before July, however, then there is no way Matarella will dissolve parliament. \nGiven the timing of the EU deadlines, I think the balance of the risk in 2017 has to fall towards the July-September bucket, but October is possible. \nDoes anyone know if there are specific constitutional guidelines for the election i.e. how many days after the dissolution of parliament it would have to happen?

As for the other parties: Italian Left 3.6%, Forza Italy 12.0%, Brothers of Italy 4.7%, Ncd 3, 1%, the Northern League 13,8%, Other parties 4.2%.\n____________________________\nCOMMENTS:  While the above first numbers seem favoring that the Italians will go to vote for a new government (53% is not a lot); popular sentiment is not quite that way. Italian have little faith and patience left for their Government/leaders. However, leaders are now divided: Renzi, who in case of elections and a majority in the seats of Parliament would become again PM; is thinking again. After all the NO at the referendum was a NO to him as PM than anything else. Perhaps he was told to hold his horses M5S are having internal troubles and scandals of their own. Particularly bad is the appointment of the Mayor of Rome, Ms. Raggi, an unexperienced and ingenuous too young lady, who seems to get into troubles endlessly. Salvini, leader of a minority party, and the most \"anti-EU/EURO-pro-Trump-Le Pen-Wilders\" will never made it to much as it will need to be in coalition with probably FI Berlusconi, who as he awaits another trial for corruption in April, and the Court in Strasbourg did not yet (if ever) give him the green light to a candidacy, just declared:\n\"You can not go to vote in June. The elections on November 1 are impossible. Lead the country to the polls in these conditions is irresponsible \" he obviously prefer Elections as late as possible (he thinks he doesn't age!) But the major deterrent to early elections may be the spread between Italian 10-year sovereign bonds and the benchmark German Bund.  The yield spread between French ten-year bonds and German rose to 72 basis points.

Following the Court's pronunciation, the Senate will now be elected based on a purely proportional system with preferences but with an election threshold set at 8% for individual parties and 20% for coalitions. In the House of Deputies on the other hand, there will be no coalitions or preferences, but a majority premium for the party that is granted at least 40% of the vote, with no second ballot. Mechanisms that are clearly at odds with each other and if applied without any changes, would wipe out the small parties in the upper house. The ruling now means that the parliament has to take steps to align the two electoral systems. A result that certainly empowers the current government. The tendency towards a return to a proportional electoral system, which many political forces have solicited, will almost automatically lead to the formation of a grand coalition government following the vote in February 2018. Perhaps out of inertia, or the need for a little propaganda, or perhaps because they haven't yet clearly reckoned with the effects of the Court's ruling, a few party leaders are calling for an immediate vote. These are skirmishes to little effect, seeing as one first has to await the publication of the motivations of the ruling (middle of February), and then engage in a reform which, as repeatedly called for by the President of the Italian Republic, Sergio Mattarella, shall provide the country with a uniform electoral law for both Houses of Parliament. The effect of the decision therefore strengthens the government led by Paolo Gentiloni, who will thus be in a position to keep working until the end of the legislature. \" Source: http://www.eastonline.eu/en/opinions/eastwest-online/political-weekly-news-italy-30-january-2017"], [32843, "2017-01-30T22:04:31Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "Constitutional issue now out of the way and the major parties seem to want to have an election pretty soon. http://www.politico.eu/article/italian-court-revises-election-law-clearing-way-for-new-poll-elections/\nAs things stand, Italy seems to have a government that is muddling through - if elections aren't called in an deliberate, timely fashion, I expect the first crisis will trigger them anyway."], [35, "2017-01-30T20:44:45Z", [0.0, 0.11, 0.55, 0.22, 0.12], ""], [368, "2017-01-30T18:46:50Z", [0.0, 0.75, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [601, "2017-01-30T18:02:50Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.15, 0.45, 0.25], "October, after current MPs and Senators vest in their pensions."], [28414, "2017-01-30T17:41:18Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.0, 0.45, 0.4], ""], [1639, "2017-01-30T17:31:34Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.0, 0.45, 0.4], "Mr Renzi and few others are agitating for elections as soon as possible.

He thus makes for an odd bedfellow of Beppe Grillo, the leader of the main opposition group, the populist Five Star Movement; and of Matteo Salvini, who leads the radical-right Northern League.\nStrong forces are pulling in the opposite direction. Silvio Berlusconi, the head of Forza Italia, needs to buy time: he hopes to wrest back the leadership of the right-wing camp from Mr Salvini and is waiting for the outcome of an appeal to the European Court of Human Rights against his conviction for tax fraud. If upheld, it would allow him to run again for office. There are more venal motives, too: if parliament is dissolved before September, almost two-thirds of the deputies and senators (those who entered parliament at the last election in 2013) will lose their right to a pension. Parliament could yet limp on to the end of its term in 2018.\nhttp://www.economist.com/news/europe/21715723-humiliated-voters-and-courts-former-prime-minister-still-hopes-retain-political\nThe Constitutional court rejected, just part of the \u201cItalicum,\u201d the electoral law of the previous Renzi government, therefore early elections could be more likely. It would be enough to make a few changes, to go to elections with two electoral systems in the House and Senate, as preferred by Gentiloni and the Quirinale (President).\nHowever, the EU is not particularly well-disposed towards the Italian government. Italy last year received 19 billion \u201cflexibility\u201d  on its fiscal consolidation, this year it has received other 7 but the EU - which has stretched the rules to the maximum - calls for a minimum intervention of 3.4 billion on the structural deficit. Italian debt is sailing at around 133% of GDP. The EU is demanding Italy to take actions to make the debt to decline.\nMr. Matteo Renzi, would be ready to \u201cchallenge the EU\u201d (while Gentiloni would be cautious). His strategy would be to defy the EU on the intervention towards the deficit; while also hoping to earn support, perhaps, by the Italians, when it comes time to go to the polls. The Treasury is preparing for the worst, checking possible effects of the spread in the case of a refusal to observe the EU demands. Practically checking that if the government saves 3.4 billion, would that cost twice as much on the markets, for a country that lives a year of political uncertainty, without even an A rating, and the ECB Quantitative Easing ECB being reduced.\n________________________\nCOMMENTS:  All of the above translates with a Mr. Renzi missing  his chair at Palazzo Chigi; (Gentiloni may be enjoying it and reluctant to let go; the aristocratic Gentiloni may even be more likable than Renzi).  Like all politicians Renzi counts on his popularity (is he really?) and in early elections to have a sufficient majority,  to be PM again. He never conducted a campaign before, he became PM because he maneuvered to withdraw support to the Letta Government (April to November 2013); he managed to oumaneuvered Berlusconi as well in that occasion.  Grillo or M5S, clamored for early elections immediately after the referendum, but he is now holding his horses as his party and leaders are entangled in scandals and many lack sufficient experience (the Mayor of Rome is a notable example) Lega Nord (LN) a Right-wing populist party led by Matteo Salvini; navigates on the fortunes of Le Pen, Trump, Wilders. Berlusconi, now old and sick, still hopes for early elections, although he cannot yet be a candidate as he is still awaiting a ruling from the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg; he however awaits a new trial in April. The new trial will focus on the accusation that the billionaire businessman paid more than 10m euros, between 2011 and 2015, to get witnesses to testify in his favour.

New elections are required by 23 May, 2017 (70 days after the expiration of the current parliamentary term).   Under the prior electorial law the Democratic Party (PD) won 297 seats, increased now to 303 seats, in the 630 seat Chamber of Deputies. Grillo's Populist party won 109, since reduced to 91.  This election law used closed party lists. Under the new Chamber of Deputies law:\nUnder the new \"Italicum\" election law, the rules have changed.  It is a two round system. The first round is proportional representation based open party lists.  Coalitions are not allowed, all parties must compete separatly. A second round, will be held in the event that no party obtains 40% of the available seats.  If the 40% threshold is passed in the first round, the party with the largest seat count is given 340 seats (54% of the 630 total seat count). The rest of the competing parties (with a minimum of 3% of the vote), recieve the remaining 290 seats in proportion to the percentage of the vote they obtained.\n  If no party achieves the 40% threshhold,  a second round of voting takes place with only the top two parties competing against each other for the prize of the 340 seat majority.  The remainder of the seats are then allocated as outlined in round one. \n  Current opinion polls show that neither of the leaders, PD or the M5S has 40% of the vote, although the second round polling lists M5S with an advantage.\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_next_Italian_general_election There are many complications. There are at least two possible legal challenges to the new Cambrr of Deputy law. The referendum to install the accompanying Senate reform law failed to be passed, leaving the Chamber and the Senate with differing election laws. Consider possible motivations for the PD to call early elections. If the new election law is used, M5S may get a 54% majority.  If the court challenges are allowed to play out, either the old election law will be used, or the opportunity is available to renegotiate the laws before another election, either option would be preferred to the M5S majority. Second, prior elections were held with closed, party selected, lists. The new law uses open lists , for the first time, anyone can run, possibly requiring a longer campaign to introduce the candidates.  PD also suggests that the restriction on coalitions in the first round of the elections should be changed (M5S is unlikely to have coalition partners).  If the current Chamber laws are upheld, there seems to be no reason for PD to call early elections.
