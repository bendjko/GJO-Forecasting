Despite multiple incidents of violence and intimidation by the president's supporters before the vote, the aftermath has been relatively calm thus far. Also as expected, the opposition Amizero y\u2019Abarundi has refused to accept the outcome. Yesterday they filed a petition with Burundi's Constitutional Court to annul the results.  A major concern of those who oppose the referendum is that, in addition to allowing the ruling party to strengthen its hold on power, it will allow the government to revise the system of ethnic quotas that were agreed upon as part of the Arusha Accords that ended the country's 13 year civil war. Like neighboring Rwanda, Burundi underwent a brutal war that pitted Hutu and against Tutsi. In the past, Nkurunziza's political machinations have led to an attempted coup and violent crackdowns on political protests.  In a sign that the government feels confident in its position domestically, discussions to end a 6-month-long ban on the BBC and VOA are underway.  https://www.independent.co.ug/burundi-opposition-goes-to-court-over-referendum-result/ https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/envoy-urges-dialogue-opposition-burundi-vote-55423674 http://www.iwacu-burundi.org/referendum-la-coalition-amizero-yabarundi-porte-plainte/ http://allafrica.com/stories/201805240383.html"], [172, "2018-05-26T00:35:01Z", [0.01], ""], [691, "2018-05-24T19:32:31Z", [0.02], ""], [23006, "2018-05-24T11:18:02Z", [0.0], ""], [32539, "2018-05-24T02:58:29Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2018-05-22T14:36:07Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2018-05-17T14:23:58Z", [0.0], ""], [172, "2018-05-16T22:27:55Z", [0.01], ""], [50568, "2018-05-14T16:50:58Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2018-05-14T12:24:40Z", [0.0], ""], [1333, "2018-05-13T15:40:56Z", [0.05], ""], [691, "2018-05-12T12:27:28Z", [0.0], ""], [3429, "2018-05-11T18:55:37Z", [0.01], "Yes, but will not break the 1000 civilian death mark."], [172, "2018-05-10T00:56:05Z", [0.01], ""], [33887, "2018-05-09T17:52:15Z", [1.0], ""], [29033, "2018-05-03T23:29:31Z", [0.09], "A referendum on May 18 in which President Pierre Nkurunziza will extend his term in office until 2034 is a potential flashpoint (it goes without saying that a \"yes\" win is a foregone conclusion...the vote will be neither free nor fair),  Some incidents of violence have been reported and a pro-government figure was recently jailed for threatening to drown opponents of the referndum.  http://www.irinnews.org/analysis/2018/05/03/burundi-disputed-referendum-threatens-deepen-neglected-humanitarian-crisis"], [1333, "2018-05-03T14:24:16Z", [0.0], ""], [29033, "2018-05-03T00:30:13Z", [0.02], "Although conditions appear to be conducive towards violence and instability, all is calm for the moment.
