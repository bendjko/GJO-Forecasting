The Pentagon uploaded slow-motion imagery of the test-flight, which showed a Tomahawk cruise missile emerging from a Mark 41 (Mk-41) Vertical Launch System.

However, Putin states that he is interested in expanding the arms control treaties. Furthermore, he declared that US counterparts, such as Trump and Pompeo, seem to share this goal.  An interesting statement by Putin is that he (or his government) are willing to expand the treaty to include all nuclear forces (a key strategic demand of the US). However, China seems unwilling to join any arms control treaty so far. Another aspect which prevents the extension of New START is the current development of new and prohibited missile systems by Russia and declaration by the US to do so soon.  A recent meeting between Russian and US officials to discuss fraught related to arms control is a strong indicator that the involved counterparties intend to start a formal discussion about the issues at hand. No further meetings have been agreed on, however, such talks represent a crucial step for possible future negotiations.  In the end, the likelihood for the start of formal negotiations will be adjusted by 6% in favour of \u2018yes\u2019. Both counterparties proved that they are able to discuss the issue despite recently deteriorating relations. Furthermore, the summer recess would be beneficial to kickstart informal talks without the burden of internal politics. On the other hand, upcoming military exercises, new sanctions and a climate of mistrust likely delay the next meeting as this area might be misused as a bargaining chip in a wider range of negotiations about several issues concerning the national security of both countries.

Arguing that Russia has been pushing for the nuclear arms treaty talks to begin, the US, in contrast, have been stalling and made no moves to move negotiations along. Consequently, Putin said that Russia will just not extent the treaty, if the US is not interested in beginning talks. Putin speaking so bluntly on the topic seems to underline Russia's dwindling desire to pursue these negotiations. In combination with recent remarks on Russia's arms production abilities, Putin seems to be emphasizing Russia's position as a leading military power and as such, a country that does not need treaties. \nJust around the same time, leading democrats send a letter to Trump urging him to engage with negotiations and seek an extension on the START treaty, as they feared the potential consequences of a lack of treaty.

In this update I decided to drastically change my approach as well as my forecast, considering mainly two articles I recently happened to read (https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/04/25/nuclear-security-arms-control-and-the-us-russia-relationship/ and https://www.rferl.org/a/putin-says-russia-prepared-to-drop-arms-control-treaty-if-u-s-not-interested-in-renewal/29984790.html). First of all, looking at the history of the arms control treaty between the two superpowers, it is noticeable how the first efforts generally begun from the US part, followed by a Russian side showing less interest in drafting a treaty to enhance their bargaining power. Apparently with the Trump administration, which will most likely still stand in October, thearm control barganining changed: the US are showing less interest in re-arranging the situation, even if facing the incoming end of the New START. Putin obviously can't show weakness, instead he has to show diplomatic muscles by saying that Russian security can be assured even without an arm control treaty. At this point it is not very likely that Trump and Putin will show signs of backstepping from their positions - thsi consideration relies purely from the consideration of the leaders' personality and constructed role in international politics. Moreover, \"U.S. and Russian officials in the past have held strategic stability talks to take a broad look at developments that affect their strategic relationship. Such talks are useful, particularly when new developments, such as those in the cyber and space domains, emerge and when Russian nuclear doctrine has provoked concern in Washington and led to changes in the U.S. nuclear posture. Even if strategic stability talks do not spin off specific negotiations, they provide a venue for the sides to exchange views and better understand the concerns of the other. During the Trump administration, a one-day session of strategic stability talks took place in September 2017. As of March 2019, it has not agreed to a second meeting\". If a new treaty or the extension of the New Start will happen, it will probably happen with the new US administration. \nIn a few months I will know if my previous approach would have been more accurate than this new one.

For this reason, the aim of this forecast is to a) find an applicable base rate and complement it by analyses of b) the interest of the USA and the Russian Federation and c) factors indicating the current political relations between both states. Both variables (b & c) have a positive/negative influence on the overall motivation for extending or signing an agreement.  A)\tPast trend of nuclear treaties: \nThis forecast will use the considerations of @Macbook_pro who bases his/her baseline on the assessed trends by @mbayer123 (examined probability of withdrawal from international treaties by Trump administration) and @IcemanPolitics (calculated a baseline through comparing years of nuclear agreements to the ones without). @Macbook_pro concludes that the timespan of 40 years is too long as the political environment changed fundamentally (e.g.: collapse of USSR). Furthermore, he/she emphasizes correctly the risk of a negative bias by only researching withdrawals of agreements. His/her result, before including the influence of an \u2018inside view\u2019 analysis, is 9,19% (final result after including inside view is 2,28%).  @Macbook_pro\u2019s inside view analysis seems correct, regarding the importance of potential economic benefits for the US and budgetary constraints in the case of Russia, but the estimated influence of these on the final base rate is, in my opinion, too high. As a consequence, this forecast will use the (\u2248) 9% base rate as starting point.  B)\tInterest in new/extended treaty:  \nThe current \u201cNew START\u201d agreement will expire in 2021 but includes the possibility for a five-year expansion until 2026. Trump first rejected a proposal of Putin to extend the New START treaty in February 2017. Later on, at the Helsinki summit in July 2018 both presidents didn\u2019t manage to reach an agreement again despite displaying good will. Both sides declared their interest to maintain the agreements. However, regarding US accusations that Russia isn\u2019t complying to agreed rules and Russia\u2019s position that it adheres to the rules at any time, make it seem less likely that both countries are able to reach an agreement soon. Furthermore, the Trump administration already requested a budget for the development of land-based intermediate missile systems and emphasized the strategic importance of its nuclear modernization program. Nonetheless, the Trump administration might oppose Obama\u2019s New START agreement and disagrees with its limits, but it could be that Trump is trying to draft a new arms control treaty which stipulates rules in line with US interests. According to US officials, including General John Hyten, New START supports US strategic interests after all. However, General Hyten stressed that the treaty has to be expanded in order to include new Russian nuclear capabilities which impose a threat to the USA.  However, Russian officials (like Anatoly Antonov, RU ambassador in USA) refuse to include new Russian weapons systems under New START or any other treaty. Russia will only decrease its military capabilities through a new agreement under the condition that the US will agree on limits of US military systems (such as ballistic missiles) as well. Regarding the central importance of nuclear deterrence for Russia\u2019s strategy, it seems unlikely that it will be willing to make generous concessions. Nevertheless, Russian officials stated that they would be willing to enter negotiations with Trump, but that they don\u2019t expect a breakthrough in arms control agreements regardless. Furthermore, in February 2019 Putin stated that he won\u2019t initiate negotiations with the US on nuclear arms agreements. A reason for this deliberate passivity could be that the country isn\u2019t interested in the maintenance of nuclear arms control treaties after all. According to Jon Huntsman of the Moscow Times, Russian officials informally checked if the US would agree to mutually end the INF treaty already in 2004 due to a secret development of a missile system which presumably violates the INF treaty. These aren\u2019t strong signs that Russia will accept any new agreement, however, there\u2019s still a possibility that Russian diplomats will enter into talks with the US in order to maintain a collaborative image on the international stage.   Another issue worth to mention is that the limitations stipulated in treaties/agreements like New START and INF don\u2019t address militarily emerging states like China. China\u2019s PLA rocket forces comprise of 95% missile systems which would violate INF limits. This explains the reluctance of Chinese officials to join arms control agreements and treaties as it would result in a loss of area-denial abilities \u2013 a crucial skill in the Chinese defence strategy. As a result, the US has a strategic disadvantage in regard to the deployment of such systems. This might decrease the US\u2019 interest to expand or sign new arms control agreements as it could use these systems to deter Chinese advances in contested regions such as the South or East China Sea. Russia also acknowledged China\u2019s stockpiling of such weapon systems and started to reach out to China in order to include the latter one in future agreements. C)\tPolitical relations between USA and Russia: \nThe INF treaty had been initiated by Reagan and Gorbachev to prohibit land-based intermediate range missiles. It doesn\u2019t include similar air- or sea-based missile systems. The US started to withdraw from the INF treaty based on their accusation of Russia for noncompliance with stipulated agreements after the latter had introduced a land-based cruise missile. Russia denies that it broke the treaty, as it claims that the latest missile system adheres to rules set out in the INF treaty. Russia on the other side accuses the US for being responsible for the recent deterioration of arms control treaties. It argues that the US withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (limiting missile defence systems) forced Russia to react by developing weapons which are able to circumvent these defence systems in order to maintain Russia\u2019s nuclear deterrence. More arms control treaties had been undermined in the last years such as the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces or the so-called Open Skies (stipulated limits for military surveillance activities). The implementation of the New START treaty represents an exception than the rule concerning the historical trend in the last two decades.  Furthermore, the US and Russia face each other as adversaries supporting different warring factions in conflicts such as the armed conflict in East Ukraine, the civil war with multiple factions in Syria, the struggle over control of two main camps in Libya or the different stance of both countries towards Iran and its regional politics. Indeed, these conflicts resemble the proxy wars of the cold war era. The result may be that both states will try to use negotiations over disarmament and/or the development of new nuclear capabilities as another bargaining chip against the other side, hence, reducing the chance that existing treaties will be expanded, or new ones agreed on. These opposing interests, as well as accusations of US politicians and the US media that Russia illegally influenced the US elections, resulted in the imposing of new sanctions against Russia by the US. Indeed, the US has increased steadily the number and the scope of these sanction programs against Russia and its strategic partners in the last years. Trump presumably good relationship with Putin is nullified, because the anti-Russia stance became the new common ground for bipartisan cooperation between Democrats and Republicans.  However, the current relation between both countries should be evaluated in the context of the 1980s, the decade before the first START treaty had been signed. Tensions between the USSR and the West soared due to USSR\u2019s Afghanistan invasion in 1979. The election of Reagan (1980) increased tensions further as the US president implemented his Reagan Doctrine which aimed to undermine the influence of the USSR by supporting resistance movements against communist governments across the globe. Military exercises of the US and its allies, like Able Archer in 1983, represented a new peak of mutual mistrust and a crisis comparable to the Cuban missile crisis. Relations between both countries started to improve when Gorbachev became the new general secretary of the USSR in 1985. Nonetheless, the START treaty was initiated in 1982 by Reagan at a time of extraordinary tensions. As a result, the current political relation between both countries could be evaluated as more stable than during the early 1980s, despite recent negative developments as mentioned before (or current remakes of military exercises by NATO or Russian troops). However, this doesn\u2019t mean that formal negotiations are more likely as higher tensions influence political actors to react by addressing and reducing these. The latest developments could also be interpreted as the first phase in a new cold war (as some foreign policy commentators do). This means that the pressure on both presidents to de-escalate might not be as high as it was back then.    The initial base rate of 9% will be decreased to a 4% probability that new formal negotiations will take place before the 1st of October. This probability will be decreased each month by 1% given the absence of significant events which support an increase of the assessed probability. As a result, there will be a 1% chance in September. The reason for this conclusion is that most actions and events tend to have a negative influence on the interest or motivation to enter formal negotiations. Economic circumstances (as described by @Macbook_pro), current and future developments of new (nuclear) weapon systems, the challenge through China\u2019s emerging military capabilities and ambitions, the recent trend of weakened or unilateral cancelled arms control treaties, the conflict of strategic interests and finally the limited amount of time left until the 1st of October. The two significant arguments for an increase of the probability aren\u2019t convincing enough after a second review. Both countries\u2019 presidents and their officials declared their interest in maintaining these arms control agreements but in the same time both states are unwilling to make concessions in order to reach a compromise. Another supportive argument is the comparison of the cold war to current times and the conclusion that tensions aren\u2019t as high as they once were. Considering the negative developments, this comparison turns out to be more counterproductive than supportive for arguing in favour of formal negotiations. Either both presidents aren\u2019t under as high pressure to find a compromise as the former presidents back then or the current events represent the first phase in a new cold war.

Both forecasters offer an interesting, but quite different approach to the asses the starting point in the outside view. It would be wise to use both insights and take an average (even through are pretty close right now). But first I will try to get around, some methodological traps.  Looking at historical data to find out, how many times USA and Soviet Union/Russia to get a feeling how common are the agreements. But the world order has changed. Most of the arms agreements listed in https://www.armscontrol.org/print/2556 are made under the bipolar world order (until the end of the Cold War) and during the total dominance of the USA - uni-polar world order. I would argue that the rise of BRICS countries, especially economic rise of China and Russia's aggressive behavior is a challenge to the hegemonic world order of the United States. That is why I suggest to shorten the time line to around 2000, even if its not given that we live in a multipolar world order, but I believe, as mentioned before rise of China and Russia has created different dynamics in the international system. That leaves us only with 2 agreements. SORT (2002) and New Start (2010) in 19 years. 2/19 = 10,5 %.  It would be efficient to look at not only how many international agreement Trump administration has pulled USA out, but also how many Trump has signed. Looking only on withdrawals creates a negative bias. However, after searching the internet for a database of international treaties, I give up. There are no good search engine which is up to date. If anybody knows a database \u2013 I would appreciate the tip. Anyhow, I will go with @mbayer123 \u2018s baserate of 14 %. The average of the two baselines is 12,25 % chance that the negotiations on arms control would begin this year.  As the date is 1 october it takes three month of a year, so lets say the baserate should go down by 25 % of 12,25 = 9 ,19 % is my base rate. So lets look on the inside view. I will stick with my augmentation in my earlier forecast: \nIt seems that Trumps idea of strengthening the economy also involves boosting the military production. The arms control only limits that cause. \nIn my opinion, hard line against European NATO allies for reaching 2% of GDP spending on military is also a part of Trumps strategy. \nOn the other side, Russia\u2019s economy is collapsing, but Putin needs a way to show the domestic crowd Russian international strength - focusing on military and framing that Russia will not be controlled by the US, is a great distraction from domestic problems. Domestic politics in both countries do not favor a new agreement soon. That must cut the base rate twice, one time per partner that need to be willing to negotiate. So 9,19 % / 2 = 4,56 % for USA. And once again for Russia. 4,56 % / 2 = 2,28 % is the final forecast.    \n"], [74021, "2019-05-22T08:25:42Z", [0.0], ""], [73905, "2019-05-22T01:44:17Z", [0.0], "Russia is getting increasingly aggressive since the war with Georgia back in August of 2008.

In my analysis, I mainly rely on an internal view. To my mind, there is a little relevance to analyse those type of treaties from the external view, for instance, looking at other similar treaties and how often they are extended, due to a shortage of data. There are not a lot of cases from other countries that could be weighty enough to compare it to the U.S. and Russia. As a result, we can only compare this case to the previous 5 treaties among the U.S and Russia, that started in 1969. Looking on past treaties and circumstances among them it is barely possible to find one pattern that we could rely on as the period is full of withdrawals, unfinished negotiations and etc.  From the internal view, circumstances changed a lot compared to the ones in 2010. As of today, as for Russia, Russia has started a war in Ukraine in 2014, meddled in the U.S Presidential Elections 2016, used a chemical weapon Novitchok in the UK and poisoned their own agent and his daughter in 2018. What is important, pieces of evidence are sound enough not to raise any doubts about Russia's involvement. Regarding the U.S, Trump's extraordinary personality is barely comparable to any of his predecessors. In this case, it is quite hard to see any coherent position towards Russia and its actions. Some days it looks like Putin is seen as an enemy, while another - as a friend. \nBesides that, there is some sound evidence why it is very unlikely for the negotiations to begin before October.\nFirst, both countries exchanged accusations of Nuclear Arms Control Treaty violations towards each other. As a result, the U.S suspended the treaty. \nSecond, there are obvious changes in the security environment. According to State Department Undersecretary Andrea Thompson, \u201cWhen the treaty was negotiated, the U.S was in a more benign security environment, where relations between the great powers were less tense and mistrustful\". She is specifically pointing to Russia\u2019s invasion and annexation of eastern Ukraine. Even though it could be argued that Russia's invasion of Georgia did not stop the U.S from signing the treaty with Russia in 2010, Ukraine's war cannot be seen from the same perspective. One of the reasons - United (almost) EU position towards Russia.\nThird, the important factor here is also a short time period (4,5 months). Even if could predict that despite many tensions the agreement might be reached in the future, there are no positive signs or nice gestures showing that it can be reached within 4-5 months from now.

Below are the main reasons why I believe that the new strategic arms reduction treaty between Russia and the US won\u2019t be amended in the nearest future. Additionally, I assume that there\u2019s very low likelihood that there\u2019s going to be a discussion about new treaty between the countries. \tFirst of all, I would definitely exclude the possibility of negotiations about a new treaty. If we look into the theory of arms controls and the history of previous agreements, we\u2019ll see that it\u2019s a difficult process, that is time consuming and there are certain events that lead to it. So far, the tense relations between Russia and the US haven\u2019t given us any reason to think that there might be another arms control treaty negotiation developing in the upcoming months. After Russia invaded Georgia in 2008, it might have been smart move from the US to reduce the number of strategic nuclear missile launchers by half in order to control Russian aggression. However, the invasion of Ukraine in 2014 proved that no treaty/negotiation is actually capable of decreasing the possibility of Russian military interventions in other states. Furthermore, the Russian interference in the US presidential elections and poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal further affected the relations between the countries.  \tSecond, New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) entered into force on February 5, 2011. It replaced the Treaty of Moscow (SORT), which was supposed to expire in December 2012. If the parties decide to extend or modify already existing treaty, it means it will most likely take place in 2020. However, after Trump pulled the US out of the Cold War-era Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty in February 2019, causing Russia\u2019s frustration, it is very unlikely that the parties will negotiate further extension or amendment of the New START. Trump has also demonstrated throughout his presidency that he doesn\u2019t trust the deals that were negotiated by Obama. Furthermore, Trump has said that \u201cFor too long, we have been held back by self-imposed limits while foreign competitors grow and they advance more than we have over the years\u201d. Pentagon has also announced that it is going to spend about a half trillion US dollars over a decade on new nuclear weapons, even though the poll from the Center of International and Security studies reveals that the US citizens actually prefer \u201ca more constrained nuclear posture\u201d and are very skeptical of weapons that already exist. Currently Trump has been discussing a possibility of highly ambitious treaty that will include Russia and China and all the weapons, warheads and missiles. Hence, negotiations regarding the extension/modification of the treaty isn\u2019t on the agenda of the US government.  \tFinally, if the parties will still decide to start negotiations regarding nuclear arms control, I believe that current frustration between them needs to reduce first and it will definitely need more than 5 months.

However, with that being said, October is still far away, and the situation could drastically change before then. It is also evident that the relationship is still strained, and that the two states disagree on many subjects, therefore the formal talks could not occur before 1. October, or not happen at all. Therefore 60% chance of it occurring. \nSources:  \nhttp://tass.com/world/1058332\nhttps://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/NewSTART\nhttps://www.state.gov/t/avc/newstart/#\nhttp://tass.com/defense/1058237\nhttps://www.nrk.no/urix/usa-og-russland-snakker-sammen-1.14550907"], [73202, "2019-05-14T16:20:24Z", [0.0], ""], [73189, "2019-05-14T00:22:29Z", [0.75], ""], [62808, "2019-05-13T21:39:13Z", [0.01], ""], [70978, "2019-05-13T19:28:55Z", [0.05], "Such moves are always slow, have a lot of obstacles to surmountmostly due to personal egoes blaming national pride... they're playing with fire though."], [69486, "2019-05-12T19:43:59Z", [0.05], "Russia is pushing the boundaries previously accepted by the USA and is currently in an expansionist phase.

The latest remarks of the Trump administration regarding this matter, supports this estimation. According to CNN, the Trump administration further follows the plan of a comprehensive and global arms non-proliferation treaty. This means that the administration does not only aim to expand the weapon systems covered in the treaties but also the countries that should be involved in it, including China. However, these plans are still in the early phase. Pompeo told lawmakers the US was in the \"very beginning of conversations about renewing\" the treaty. The Trump administration has not set out a timeline for negotiations or even raised the prospect with China and Russia. Given the amount of time it needs to prepare such a comprehensive strategy and given the obstacles, as described in my original forecast, e.g. in bringing China to the negotiation table, it seems to remain highly unlikely that formal negotiations will take place before October 1,2019. Thus, no adaptions regarding the forecast have to be made.  https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/25/politics/trump-nuclear-deal-russia-china/index.html"], [72818, "2019-05-02T21:11:49Z", [0.19], ""], [62808, "2019-05-02T20:57:01Z", [0.01], ""], [82, "2019-05-01T23:24:17Z", [0.01], "Current events in Venezuela are complicating the relationship between Washington and Moscow.

Pulling out of the INF could've been a way to increase pressure to bring Russia to the table and increase the US's bargaining position.

Of these, 6 are treaties or broader multinational agreements (KORUS, INF, NAFTA, JCPOA, TPP, Paris), and of those, 3 are either in the process of being renegotiated (NAFTA, KORUS) or an offer of renegotiation has been put on the table with the threat of pulling out (INF). Making a judgement based on multiple examples, the President by way of tweeting and otherwise likes to take credit for things or upend a process/agreement just to renegotiate and claim credit (Devos and Special Olympics, Government Shutdown). Since the Administration is pulling out of INF if the Russians do not come to the table, I leave a large chance that the President is willing to renegotiate on terms his administration feels are the most advantageous, and the Russians (https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2018/12/27/is-there-a-glimmer-of-hope-for-the-inf-treaty/) have shown support of continuing the treaty. This administration is arguably highly unpredictable, but given the President's priorities and personal take on treaties I give this more or less a 50/50 chance."], [67428, "2019-04-02T16:47:53Z", [0.05], "- There will be an extension/a new treaty\nI think that is very likely that Russia and the US will implement a new treaty or will introduce some modifications to the text because both of them they have recently increased their military capacity and updated their technologies.\nTo be more clear, I compare the current New START to the previous one, the START treaty negotiated in the \u201880s. At that time the tensions between the two superpowers was higher than today, and so was the fear of the capabilities and intentions of the other: that treaty reflected the suspicion and the uncertainty of those years, including strict limits on nuclear proliferation. Instead, the New START has been stipulated in 2009 and \u201cdoes not contain layers of limits and sublimits; each side can determine its own mix of land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), and heavy bombers.\u201d. It doesn\u2019t forbid the states to modernize strategic nuclear forces, even if the goal of predictability and transparency of their intention is still present. This fact has allowed Russia and US to develop their offensive nuclear technologies, so will be necessary to modernize the treaty too. I would also add that Russia is currently in a bad economic situation, and I can\u2019t imagine as a brilliant idea from Putin put himself in the position of raising the military expenditure in absence of an agreement with the US: this would mean more taxes and more dissatisfaction among the population.\nAnother reason, is the necessity of an agreement between the two powerful state about army proliferation. Indeed, after reciprocal accusations about not respecting the INF, both the State withdraw from it. So, now it is fundamental keeping at least another agreement alive and concrete, both to avoid the risk of proliferation and to not damage even more the historically troubled relations between Russia and US. \nIn addition, a renovation of this treaty would be an occasion to contrast the rise of China: indeed it has established a cooperation with European countries and is investing an impressive flow of money in infrastructure to control the markets in a not so far future (ex. The construction of BRI). In front of such a plan and because of the recent trade war that Trump has engaged with China, the US have better to keep Russia on its side at least in this field.\nIn addition, I argue that China is also developing its nuclear arms, which could be interpreted in two ways: as the reason why continuing having bilateral agreement between Russia and US is useless, because other big countries instead are becoming more aggressive, or as the reason why is necessary at least maintaining the order and pursuing cooperation, also signing bilateral agreements like this or even include the \u201cenemy\u201d (China) in order to control it. - But not before 1st October 2019\nDuring the summit in Helsinki in 2018 between Trump and Putin, trump has discussed the treaty, suggesting an extension but only after having resolved some problems. Previously, during a call, Trump had also rejected a first proposal made by Putin about the extension of the agreement. The Administration\u2019s Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) have confirmed that US will implement the treaty until 2021 but it was silent about the following years, in order to evaluate if it still represents an advantage to the national American security. From the other side, Russia\u2019s ambassador to the US A. Antonov have declared that the deterioration of arms control would be negative for both interests of Russia and US. These declarations make me assume that there will be an extension but later in time, after the 2021 deadline or in 2020. \nMoreover, nowadays there have been too many issues between Russia and US (the support by Russia to Assad in Syria, the Skripal case in UK, the contested Russian invasion of Crimea and the war, the cyber-attacks from Russia during the US elections), which have built a sort of cleavage between the two. However, behind the scenes and far away from the global press, I have the feeling that Trump doesn\u2019t want to provoke to much his adversary. This is the case of Crimea: Trump has recently sent arms to Ukraine but he didn\u2019t announce that out loud to the media press, as he did in 2018, in order to keep open the dialogue with Putin. (https://www.ilpost.it/2018/01/07/stati-uniti-vendita-armi-ucraina-trump/)\nAlso, during his campaign Trump has promised a rapprochement to Russia, that so far did not occur. The president in office could use that move in occasion of the new elections in 2020. Trump can at least start the negotiations during his next campaign, using its effort in a re-engagement with Russia as a demonstration that he maintains its promises and is trying to promote peace and cooperation between countries.

Due to the high degree of uncertainty in terms of the current US administration\u2019s international policies, and the discrepancy to former US government\u2019s policies, the forecast excludes the time prior Trump\u2019s election- even though there were already withdrawals prior, such as the US withdrawal from the Treaty on the Limitation of Missile Defence Systems (ABM Treaty). Following withdrawals were detected: \nOn January 23, 2017, Trump signed an executive order to renegotiate NAFTA, with the intention of obtaining a more favorable deal for American workers. Eventually, Canada, Mexico and the US agreed upon on replacing NAFTA with the USMCA treaty on September 30, 2017 after formal renegotiations (http://www.wongfleming.com/trump-updates-2018-trumps-treatment-of-international-treaties-immigrants-and-refugees/). \nOn January 23, 2017, Trump withdrew the US from the TPP Agreement, promoting closer economic cooperation between the signing states, without formal re-negotiations (Ibid.).\nOn January 23, 2017, Trump formally abandoned the TTIP negations for a free transatlantic economic zone and declared an \u201cend to the era of multinational trade agreements.\u201d (Ibid.) \nIn August 2017, Trump announced that the US would be withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement with the possibility of rejoining \u201cif the terms improved for the United States.\u201d Two formal negotiation sessions have taken place since then but only pro forma since the US cannot withdraw officially before three years after the agreement entered into force (Ibid.).\nOn October 12, 2017, the US notified the UN's culture and education body, UNESCO of their. decision to withdraw from the organization and to seek to establish a permanent observer mission to UNESCO instead. The United States has walked out of UNESCO once before under ex-president Ronald Reagan, who quit in 1984 over alleged financial mismanagement and claims of anti-US bias in some of its policies (https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2017/10/274748.htm).\nOn May 8, 2018 the US administration officially withdrew from the JCPOA Deal that in a nutshell aimed to block Iran from building nuclear weapons in exchange for the abolishment off a variety of sanctions. No formal re-negotiations have taken place since then. Instead, the US administration pressures its western partners and companies to abolish Iran-related business (https://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2018/05/281938.htm). \nOn June 19, 2018 the US left the UN Human Rights Council, \u201can organization that is not worthy of its name.\u201d No formal re-negotiations have taken place since then (https://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2018/06/283341.htm) . \nThis record of withdrawals from international treaties and organizations since 2017 stresses the attitude of the current US administration towards these regimes. Only in one out of the 7 cases (14%), real negotiations have taken place - considered the fact that those in the context of the Paris Climate Accord were just formal procedure. Particular meaningful for the question to be answered is the US\u2019 withdrawal from the JCPOA and the US\u2019 efforts to undermine other states\u2019 efforts to uphold it without the US.  Turning to the nuclear arms control treaty, the US administrations announced on February 1, 2019 that the US will suspend its obligations under the INF Treaty and initiate proceedings to withdraw from the Treaty. Thus the contract is completely suspended on August 2, 2019 (https://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2019-02/usa-steigen-aus-inf-abruestungsvertrag-aus). According to the US, there would still be a chance not to suspend the contract. However, Russia already declared one day later that they would suspend compliance with the treaty themselves (Ibid.). This is the worst starting position for the soon necessary extension of the New Start Treaty. Should it fail, from 2021 the strategic nuclear weapons of the USA and Russia would not be subject to any legally binding restrictions for the first time since 1968. \nBoth Russia and the US have several geo-strategic reasons to abolish the INF treaty. Next to the Trump administration\u2019s above demonstrated negative attitude towards international collaboration, the US accuses Russia - backed by its NATO allies - to violate the treaty\u2019s conditions. Respectively, Russia accuses the US to do the same. On top of that, China, not a contracting party of the INF treaty, and its INF arsenal, would also contribute to the strategic disadvantages  resulting from the treaty for the US, according to Trump. Consequently in order to enforce a solution, the US would increase its nuclear capacities, as long as there were no trilateral treatment in place. Russia, on the other hand is facing its neighboring states in the south and east in possession of INF systems, as well as the general mistrust against and rivalry with the US, further promoted by Putin (https://www.swp-berlin.org/publikation/der-inf-vertrag-vor-dem-aus/).  The above described context supports and reinforces the base rate assumption of the forecast at hand. While based upon the base rate a likelihood of 14% had to be estimated, the geo-political strategies of both actors and the US administration\u2019s strategy in the context of the JCPOA, further reduces these chances. Hence, the forecast at hand estimates a likelihood of 4% that formal negotiations will take place  before October 1, 2019."], [67423, "2019-03-30T19:36:11Z", [0.15], ""], [19801, "2019-03-29T05:15:37Z", [0.0], "U.S. Plans Flight Tests of INF-Treaty Range Missiles Defense Department officials told a group of reporters March 13 that the Pentagon is planning to test two types of conventional missiles currently prohibited by the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty by the end of this year.\nhttps://www.armscontrol.org/blog/2019-03-20/us-russian-nuclear-arms-control-watch-march-20-2019 Merkel\u2019s comments inspired Chinese State Councillor Yang Jiechi to respond that \u201cChina develops its capabilities strictly according to its defensive needs and doesn\u2019t pose a threat to anybody else.

The clearest and recent one is the accuses of the USA to Russia of having violated the INF (testing of the RS-26 Rubezh solid-fueled intercontinental ballistic missile) and the following unilateral decision to abandon the treaty. And this one has represented only the last step at least one-year period where Washington and Moscow have been touting nuclear weapons plans in what to many has seemed like a throwback to the Cold era. In addition. The very recent declaration of Russia says that it won\u2019t destroy missiles U.S. claimed by the USA as breaking INF made relations between 2 countries only worse.  Then, if Georgia should really join Nato (there are ongoing negotiation), Russia would go on a rampage and act in the less cooperative way possible (and maybe rather in the most aggressive possible). Furthermore, there are all those actions and events which have contributed in rising tension over the recent years (e.i. annexation of Crimea, Syria, disinformation campaign/accusations etc) which led to a huge lack of confidence from both sides. Last but not least, Trump more than one time has referred to the new Start as a \u201cbad deal\u201d implemented by the Obama administration.  Another key reading sees Russia and Usa less and less interested in bilateral agreement now that the nuclear threat might come by so many different actors. Particularly, the Usa are concerned by China and its quickly increasing nuclear program. Therefore, both Russia and the USA might abandon their long-lasting bilateral management of nuclear weapons and start a new path including (at least) China. However, doing so would also mean to recognize the legitimacy of existing nuclear programs and the definitive loss of their bilateral approach.\n\nThat said, overall I assess a 75% chance that a new nuclear arms control treaty or an extension/modification of an existing nuclear arms control treaty will NOT begin before 1 October 2019.  Nevertheless and although the crowd consensus is at 5%, I decided to leave a 25% chance for the following reasons:\n-Trump and Putin praised their intentions to continue nuclear arms control during the last Helsinki summit. Also Russia\u2019s ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov have recently stated that the deterioration of arms control would be against both interests of the two states.  Yes, they definitely could be just \u201cbon ton declarations\u201d, but they could also hide common concerns and the unwillingness of a new arms race. \n-The \u201cNew START\u201d has a much greater symbolic value of the INF. Letting it dying would mean put the word end to one of the cornerstones of the arms control process. In other words, it would mean throwing in the rubbish 50 years of difficult and long negotiations. Are the USA and Russia really willing to start a new arms race and with it a new Cold war (even though according to some scholars is already ongoing)? Russia is in a terrible economic condition and raising taxes to pay arms production and research would make it only worse. On the other hand, rising the military expenditure could cost to Trump votes, at least on the long run (although Trump claims that raising the military production would be beneficial for the economy). \n-The recent communication of the filing of the Trump-Russia investigation which Trump celebrated as a victory might also let him feel less judged in being more collaborative with Putin. \n-They have all the interest to make a new agreement which includes China as well and the expiry of the treaty could be a good \u201cexcuse\u201d.  That said,  I do not assess more than a 25% chance of negotiations starting before 1 October 2019 anyway. This because, even though for the reasons mentioned the two countries could perhaps opt for a new agreement or for the revision of the actual, I consider October 2019 still too early. As typical in Russian-American relationship, also in the case of a positive outcome they would before play the so-called chicken game (two players drive cars at each other, the first to swerve away and slow down loses and is humiliated as the chicken) and, hence, start negotiations at the closely to the very end of the expiring treaty or even after this occurs.

This led Russia to respond in kind and leave the INF. These recent developments do not bode well for negotiations of the NEW STAR deal.  However, Russia\u2019s ambassador to the US, Anatoly Antonov, recently expressed his concern over the deterioration of the arms control agreements; warning that no one wins a nuclear war (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/04/russia-us-nuclear-arms-weapons-control-crisis). This can be understood as a willingness on the Russian side to seek negotiations and continue the STAR deal. However, the ambassador simultaneously rejected that new negotiations should include new nuclear weapons and that Russia had been violating the INF in the first place.  (https://www.defenseone.com/politics/2019/03/new-new-start-nonstarter-russian-ambassador/155474/) The US seemingly is still undecided in relation to a renewal of the STAR deal. While the US is consulting with experts in regard to the potential for re-negotiating a nuclear arms control with the Russians, Andrea Thompson, the US Under Secretary of State Arms Control, expressed a sense of distrust in Russia\u2019s willingness to uphold their part of the deal. Seemingly indicating that a deal would not be beneficial, and that US had significant reservations as of now. (https://nationalinterest.org/feature/nuclear-arms-control-trump-era-46812).

Developments that had been stalled since the 1980s while the US had been part of the INF.

(https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/11/us-cruise-missile-development-russia-inf-treaty-) In conclusion, it seems the two parties are still at a good distance from being ready to commence any negotiations. The EU has been somewhat passive in relation to this; despite the very real security threat these developments could come to pose. Potentially, EU\u2019s involvement could bring the parties to the negotiation table.

Instead, I find very likely that Trump will engage in new negotiations, but when? Trump made a point of honour that during his presidency, he will be the man who succeeded in bringing Washington and Moscow closer together, and in particular on the crucial question of nuclear power. Thus, despite the dissent and strategic benefits (from a realistic point of view in IR) of the current situation \u2014 e.g deterrence towards China \u2014 I find most likely that Trump will seek to re-discuss with Moscow.

However, they need to resolve some of the \"existing problems related to the Treaty Implementation\" \n(such as Russian's noncompliance with the INF treaty and other arms control agreements). These problems will be conducive to delaying negotiations for an agreement, pending the resolution of these different, and given the New START 2021 deadline, perhaps October 2019 may seem a bit early. Indeed, the confidence gap between the two countries seems to push the percentages of success of the beginning of a negotiation of a new agreement or an extension before 1 October 2019 down.\nThe negotiation of an extension seems to be the only solution for the beginning of a negotiation before October 2019. The extension is supported by certain analysts of the American government, because it would allow certain advantages (limiting the number of deployed strategic nuclear weapons in Russia, avoiding misperceptions) and by providing additional five years to possibly reach new agreements on further reductions or transparency measures (source: https://fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/R41219.pdf). However, Trump and his administration seems unwilling to extend the treaty, preferring to redo another. Indeed, the U.S. President has said that it is one of many bad deals the Obama administration negotiated for the United States. In the idea of a new agreement,  some people explaining that the US and Russia could either renegotiate the treaty or replace it with something more like the 2002 Moscow Treaty. One possible option is to negotiate a new treaty that retains the most salient features of New START, such as limits on deployed forces and robust transparency and verification measures, but addresses matters of particular importance to the United States, such as the number of nonstrategic nuclear weapons possessed by Russia, or new types of nuclear delivery systems. However, in that case, it may not provide a capable or timely response to the expiration of New START. Indeed, Russia has been unwilling to accept limits on its nonstrategic nuclear delivery vehicles in the past, and any attempt to convince them to do so in the future may require the United States to agree to the elimination of its nuclear weapons deployed in Europe. Neither side is likely to accept the demands of the other, an effort to renegotiate New START would likely fail to produce a new treaty before its 2021 expiration (source : https://fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/R41219.pdf). In sum, there is more likelihood for a negotiation of a new treaty, but it is very likely that given the current state of US-Russian relations and the 2020 presidential US campaign, the beginning of negotiations will happen in 2020 or even in 2021.\n"], [23006, "2019-03-01T23:26:20Z", [0.01], ""], [691, "2019-03-01T19:54:44Z", [0.01], ""], [11430, "2019-02-28T19:52:10Z", [0.05], ""], [38548, "2019-02-28T16:57:56Z", [0.05], ""], [6518, "2019-02-27T23:27:10Z", [0.05], ""], [33217, "2019-02-27T22:11:46Z", [0.0], "absolutely not. \nIt is very likely that trump gets reelected, so they wont sign a treaty like this at least until 2025."], [11430, "2019-02-27T19:32:43Z", [0.05], "No advantage to either country to do a treaty."], [3110, "2019-02-27T15:08:26Z", [0.15], ""], [67669, "2019-02-27T14:10:58Z", [0.05], ""], [67416, "2019-02-27T13:40:12Z", [0.05], "It seems that Trumps idea of strengthening the economy also involves boosting the military production.

But \"new nuclear arms control treaty' in Q is pretty clear. That rules out a meeting where the agreement details aren't the sole focus; such as someone referring to modifying or eliminating, say, clause #.#; or section 1A,  (As opposed to a discussion about arms, treaties, or violations) 2) Russia doesn't think it has violated the agreement. So any discussions along lines of \"Russia, either you agree to stop violating, or else we [USA] will withdraw,\" is not negotiation. It's a diplomacy tactic to get one side to 1) comply with agreement,  or 2)  get one side to admit to a violation.  2A) Both of these would be precursors to 1) US formally withdrawing (or Russia)  or 2) US/Russia formally agreeing to some sort of change in international behaviour which would, one would seriously hope to expect, be ADDED to contract through formal negotiations. Really, would compliance be sorted with a handshake and a verbal agreement? I have to say \"No thanks.\" Arms reductions play-by rules really should be written down. 3) Russia  could still fancy themselves better off without restriction of treaty which is how the US views the agreement; as constraining them while allowing other countries (non-Russian ones like China and Iran) to potentially keep amassing weapons. Then Putin and Trump would formally agree (probably very nicely) to nix it together. Buds forever. 4) I don't think, even if we assume Russia has been in violation several times, since treaty inception (and it probably has - Second worse coverup in history?), Russia is not the bad guy in this treaty thing. Other countries are in Trump's crosshairs ( bad pun). Trump wants Russia's help to thwart Iran collecting Uranium and making parts; control Syrian hot potato/musical chair thing where $$$, trafficked goods, UN resources, etc all pass through that country and  trickle north, south, east and west to aid neighbouring country fights. Saudi Arabia seems to have its own wacky plans, Yemen, etc.  5) As Bolton says, START will be included  in Nov talks, but so might other topics (China? Syria?Trade? Oil?) or might be more of a quick televised meet-and-greet -- especially, since this would be the first time the two have met since the nasty election biz. The focus then wouldn't be on treaty so not, to my mind, formal negotiations. 6) If meeting is  short (10 minutes - 45 minutes? )  then more likley goes to 'discussion' bin, and not 'formal negotiation\" bin. 6) Trump tends to slam stuff out there as a tactic, to see where the chaff falls. Worked for him here, as Russia was taken off guard and adopted a friendly, rather than pugnacious tone which puts them mentally in the headspace of giving something (slight) up, as opposed to stubbornly holding fast.  7) The news articles say \"Putin emphasized the need to maintain a dialogue, saying he would be ready to meet with Trump in Paris during centenary commemorations next month marking the end of World War I.\" \"Dialogue\" goes to discussion bin, not negotiation, I think. Anyway, I just don't think question should resolve as yes based on Nov 11th meeting even if Putin and Trump talk about START, and even if they talk about withdrawing. That's just bro conversations.

On Monday, he held talks with Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev, after which he told Kommersant correspondent Yelena Chernenko about the reasons for the US withdrawal from the Treaty on the Elimination of Medium and Short Range Missiles (1987) and the upcoming meeting of Presidents Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. - How did your negotiations with Nikolai Patrushev go? Is it true that you came to Moscow primarily to bury the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles (INF)? - (Laughs.) Today was my second meeting with Nikolai Patrushev and the staff of the Russian Security Council. The first time I met them was before the summit in Helsinki. I came to prepare the ground for a meeting between Presidents Trump and Putin. Patrushev at the time seemed to be in South Africa. So I met with his deputy (Yuri Averyanov - \u201cKommersant\u201d ) and other colleagues. Patrushev and I first met in Geneva in August. In any case, this is the second meeting after Helsinki, it was scheduled about six weeks ago. Now is just the right time to meet. We arrived with a broad agenda. Many issues - for example, arms control and all related topics - were discussed in Geneva in August. We discussed them then and planned to do it again in Moscow. And we had these plans before the President\u2019s Saturday statement (on the US intention to withdraw from the INF Treaty. \u201cKommersant\u201d ). What you need to know about the agreement on the elimination of medium-range and shorter-range missiles\nHistory, the essence and importance of the contract - in the material \"b\" - So you are not a messenger from Trump, who came to discuss the details of the process of the US withdrawal from the treaty? - In my opinion, the President (Donald Trump - \u201cKommersant\u201d ) on Saturday made a very strong, clear and direct statement about his views (on the future of the INF Treaty - \u201cKommersant \u201d) and what will be the US foreign policy in this area. What to do with the contract and when to make it public - he decides as the president of the USA. What I did today (and I will do tomorrow) was the way the president\u2019s thoughts were explained and what the next steps might be. - Can you explain to us? What are the reasons for this decision? - Five or even more years ago, during the presidency of Barack Obama, the United States concluded that Russia committed substantial violations of the INF Treaty, was involved in the production and deployment of missiles that do not comply with the terms of the agreement. The Obama administration has called on Russia to return to fulfilling its obligations. The Trump administration called for the same. But based on Russian statements, it became clear that they (the authorities of the Russian Federation\u2014 \u201cKommersant\u201d ) do not at all believe that some kind of violation took place. And today, during the talks, my Russian interlocutors very clearly expressed their position - that this is not Russia that violates the INF Treaty, but the United States. Now, some say: \"This is just a negotiating move by President Trump, and if we could force Russia to return to the fulfillment of obligations, the treaty would be saved.\" But this is impossible from the point of view of logic. It is impossible to return to the implementation of the arrangements of someone who does not believe that something is breaking.\nThis is the reality we face. As the president said, Russia is doing what we think is considered a violation of the agreement, and we will not tolerate it without being able to respond. We do not think that withdrawal from the agreement is what creates the problem. We think that what Russia is doing in violation of the INF Treaty is the problem.\nSecond moment. No one except us in the world is bound by this treaty. Although this is technically incorrect: lawyers will tell you that the former USSR countries (with the exception of the three Baltic republics, which the US never recognized as part of the USSR), were also bound by the treaty when the USSR collapsed. But the remaining 11 countries do not have any ballistic missiles. That is, only two countries in the world are bound by the INF Treaty. One of these countries violates the agreement. Thus, there is only one country in the world bound by the terms of the document - the USA. And this is unacceptable. At the same time, we see that China, Iran, the DPRK - they all strengthen their potential with methods that would violate the INF Treaty, if these countries were its signatories. Fifteen years ago, it was possible that the agreement could be expanded and made multilateral. But today it is already impracticable in practice. And the threat from China is real - you can ask countries such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan or Australia what they think about the Chinese (missile. - \u201cKommersant\u201d ) potential. They are nervous about this. Many in Europe and the Middle East are nervous about Iran\u2019s potential. As the President explained on Saturday, this puts the United States in an unacceptable position. And that is why he promulgated the decision (on withdrawal from the INF Treaty. - \u201cKommersant\u201d ). - In the author\u2019s column in The Wall Street Journal in 2011, you stated that the INF Treaty \u201chas long outlived its usefulness and needs to be revised, or it must be abandoned.\u201d However, at that time no one blamed Russia for any violations. In this regard, there are assumptions that you are just looking for a pretext to withdraw from the contract. \u201cWe have not met with you before, but I can tell you that more than once in the past six months, journalists have told me:\u201c You wrote like this in a certain year, but this and that was said on television ... \u201dWatch ... What is said and written is already said and written. And I generally do not disown this. But now my job is not to make decisions in the field of national security, but to give advice on national security. And this principle is adhered to by all advisors. And the president, believe me, makes decisions himself. - Can Russia do something to make the United States change their mind about withdrawing from the treaty? - The President has already spoken on this topic. If Russia had eliminated all of its weapons, created in violation of this treaty, and if China did the same, the situation would be different. But I think that the probability of this is zero. - And there is no chance to make the treaty multilateral? In 2007, Russia and the United States at the UN spoke in favor of this, but this initiative was never implemented. - Yes, and this topic was discussed even back in 2001\u20132004, when I was working in the George Bush administration as deputy secretary of state for arms control and international security. Perhaps, if we, at a sufficiently early stage, took some action, it would be possible. But now, for example, between a third and a half of the total number of Chinese ballistic missiles do not conform to the INF Treaty. And supposing that they (the Chinese authorities\u2014 \u201cKommersant\u201d ) would destroy, perhaps more than half of their ballistic missiles, is simply unrealistic. - Do the United States plan to produce and deploy missiles in Europe that can quickly reach Moscow after withdrawing from the treaty? And will you do the same in Asia? - We have not made decisions on this. But I can say that this is another treaty anomaly. Technological anomaly. Now sea-based cruise missiles have a range that falls under the INF Treaty. But since they are located on American ships in the Baltic Sea, they do not violate the treaty. And if you move them to the coast of Poland, it will already be a violation. What was expected from the talks between Moscow and Washington on the INF But all this empty talk, not related to the more important problems. And the US sees a problem here in a global sense. We are concerned about the violation of the treaty by Russia, its possible actions in the European theater (military operations. \u201cKommersant\u201d ). But we are also concerned about the East Asian theater, the South Asian theater, the situation in Iran and the Middle East. These are global challenges that led to the conclusions and decisions that we made. - The European allies of the United States, including France and Germany, reacted negatively to the statement by Donald Trump about his intention to withdraw from the INF Treaty. Does the US not care about their opinion? - We consulted with them. The British Secretary of Defense said that he was strongly on the side of the United States in this matter. - But he was the only one. \u201cBut this is a very important country, considering its defense expenses.\u201d I am convinced that Japan and other countries will support us. We will continue to consult with our NATO allies on this issue. We have already begun this process and will continue it. - The Russian reaction was also extremely negative. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said that the US is \u201cblackmailing\u201d Russia ... - This is generally not true. Let's go back to the beginning of our conversation. This is a Russian breach of the INF Treaty brought us to the current point. And it lasted five years, if not more. - Your interlocutor, Nikolai Patrushev, must have made counterclaims to you in violation of the INF Treaty. Have you been able to address the concerns of the Russian side? - You know, in our Pentagon there are more lawyers per person than in the military department of any other country. And if something is not right, then it will definitely not escape from them and they will not fail to declare it. So I am absolutely sure that we do not violate the INF Treaty.\n- Let me ask you about the future of the Treaty on the Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms of 2010 (START-3.\u2014 \u201cKommersant\u201d). Russia proposes to extend its action, the US has already decided on this? - No, we haven't decided yet. But we were discussing START-3 today. This agreement expires in 2021. So we still have time. I have been involved in arms control for many years and I know that many decisions are made at the last moment. Now in the US there is a discussion of what to do with this agreement. One of the points that we consider important is to first resolve the issue with the INF Treaty. I talked about this with Nikolai Patrushev and others (representatives of the leadership of the Russian Federation\u2014 \u201cKommersant\u201d ), explained our logic, we try to be open in this regard. - Did you discuss the possible meeting between the two leaders and when it might happen? - Yes, we discussed this. And I told Nikolai Patrushev what opportunities we see in this regard. He said that he would hand over everything to President Putin. I do not want to anticipate the decision of the Russian president, but perhaps in the near future we will have something to tell you. - The press discussed Paris and Buenos Aires as possible places to meet. - Well ... You have identified two places where they (Presidents Putin and Tramp.\u2013 \u201cKommersant\u201d ) will both be (at multilateral meetings in November . - \u201cKommersant\u201d ). But we can also imagine a full-fledged summit, like the one that was in Helsinki, in some other place."], [28414, "2018-10-23T09:17:35Z", [1.0], "What the Security Council told about the five-hour meeting of Patrushev and Bolton\u200d\nhttps://www.gazeta.ru/politics/2018/10/22_a_12030313.shtml\nThe first day of the visit of Advisor to the American President John Bolton to Moscow was devoted to the dialogue (Rus for negotiations) on the START and INF Treaty. These topics were touched upon during the Bolton talks with the head of the Russian Security Council Nikolai Patrushev and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. The possibility of extending the START Treaty says that the United States is still ready to conduct a strategic dialogue with Russia, despite the desire to leave the INF Treaty, the expert said. The head of the Russian Security Council, Nikolai Patrushev, and US National Security Advisor to the President, John Bolton, held on Monday, October 22, a meeting that lasted five hours. As noted in a press release quoted by RIA Novosti , the parties exchanged views on the extension of the treaty on the reduction and limitation of strategic offensive arms (START) after 2021 for another five years. Bolton himself said that he and Patrushev had very serious discussions on arms limitation, the parties discussed various options for a new START treaty. In addition, he said that Now the United States better understand the Russian position, and they want to clarify the details. The START III Treaty between Russia and the United States entered into force in 2011. The agreement provides for the reduction of deployed strategic carriers on each side to 700 units and to 1,550 nuclear warheads. Messages about the possibility of extending the contract for 5 years until 2026, that is, when the term of stay of the current presidents of Russia and the United States, Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump , ends, gives some hope that this agreement can be maintained. As the leading IMEMO researcher Sergei Oznobishchev notes in an interview with Gazeta.Ru , \"The message of readiness to extend the treaty means that the United States is ready to conduct a strategic dialogue with Russia.\" According to the expert, \"we only need to send it in the right direction for us.\" It can be assumed that if the START III treaty is extended, it will become a kind of \u201cdeal\u201d between Donald Trump and Russia in the event of his withdrawal from the treaty on the elimination of medium and short-range missiles (DRSM). This agreement, signed in 1987, is considered the cornerstone of international security. According to this treaty, both the USSR and the USA destroyed a whole class of operational-tactical missiles in Europe. US President Donald Trump said earlier that the United States could withdraw from the INF Treaty, and accused Russia of violations of this agreement. However, this decision may not be final - Trump made it clear that a new version of the treaty is possible, if China also participates in it. It is known that China has a large number of medium-range missiles, and Washington sees them as a threat to their interests in the region and the interests of their allies. The topic of the INF Treaty was discussed not only during the meeting between Bolton and Patrushev , but also during the working dinner of Bolton and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, which took place on October 22 in the Foreign Ministry mansion. The reaction of the Russian Foreign Ministry on this issue is already known. Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia Sergei Ryabkov called the American position \"blackmail\". Some experts believe that Trump's statements are aimed at forcing Russia to influence China - it is beneficial for Washington to join Beijing in the treaty. Oznobishchev, on the other hand, believes that Trump, as a businessman, wants to conduct a definite deal with China, suggesting that China give up missiles in exchange for ending the trade war. However, according to the expert, such an agreement looks \"unrealistic.\" Trump's statements about a possible exit from the INF range caused an ambiguous reaction both within the United States and in the world. Republican Senator Bob Corker warned that the announcement of withdrawal from the treaty could lead to the cancellation of other agreements on weapons issues. However, Corker suggests that Trump\u2019s last statement can only mean his desire to put pressure on Moscow. In turn, British Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson said that the UK \"with full determination\" supports Washington in this matter, and called on Moscow to \"restore order,\" reports Financial Times . But German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said that Trump's intention \"raises difficult issues for us and Europe.\" It is worth noting that during the period of the \"cold war\" in the territory of Great Britain were American medium-range and short-range missiles, which provided a direct threat to the USSR. It is possible that after the UK\u2019s exit from the EU, missiles of this class may reappear there. Experts also believe that US missiles may also appear on the territory of Poland and Romania, where elements of the US missile defense are located. \u201cThe risk of a nuclear war in Europe is increasing by an order of magnitude,\u201d said Igor Korotchenko, editor-in-chief of the publication National Defense . He expressed this opinion on the program \u201cThe Right to Vote\u201d, which aired on Monday, October 22. To counter the United States in the event of their withdrawal from the INF Treaty, the expert suggests resuscitating the Molodets railway missile system. This complex is a train, inside which are located strategic missile systems. Experts do not exclude that in the event of the deployment of US missiles in Europe, Russia may deploy Iskander operational tactical complexes capable of carrying tactical nuclear weapons in the Kaliningrad Oblast, the European enclave of Russia. True, the press secretary of the Russian president, Dmitry Peskov, said that it is not yet possible to assess whether the statements of the American president Donald Trump about withdrawing from the treaty on the elimination of medium and shorter-range missiles (DDSMD) will affect the START-III treaty. According to the spokesman, in this situation it is necessary to wait for concrete steps by Washington, because now the US intentions were not supported by actions. \u201cIn this case, some hypothetical reasoning is possible, but hardly appropriate. We need to wait for concrete steps on the part of Washington, \u201dsaid Peskov, quoted by RIA Novosti. The Russian side may receive an answer to this question soon. Already on Tuesday, October 23, Bolton will meet with Russian President Putin, to whom he must set forth the considerations of the American president."], [15196, "2018-10-23T08:10:54Z", [0.9], ""], [41922, "2018-10-23T07:54:45Z", [1.0], ""], [26711, "2018-10-23T03:33:03Z", [0.25], ""], [32258, "2018-10-23T03:17:26Z", [0.51], "Great points @shivadiva"], [32258, "2018-10-23T03:11:07Z", [0.25], "Will formal negotiations between Russia and the United States on a new nuclear arms control treaty or an extension/modification of an existing nuclear arms control treaty begin before 1 October 2019?\n_____________\nI take this to mean that pulling out of INF without negotiations over extension or modification resolves as a No. To resolve as yes, formal negotiations must begin before a year from now on New Start or if pulling out of INF is just positioning to actually begin negotiations over the modification of INF. \nPossible.. so increasing."], [60033, "2018-10-23T02:31:38Z", [0.5], ""], [23006, "2018-10-23T02:01:35Z", [0.51], "Still in the planning stages.

Trump announced withdrawing on eve of a pre-planned meeting. But I think meeting was pre-planned as a diplomatic \u201cstability review, and topic was launched on its eve to take Russians by surprise. Sort of knock them off their feet and get them scrambling, prior to any formal negotiation. Itseems Trump did a fair bit of groundwork going back at least to February\u2019s Nuclear Posture Review, but probably before that too. As early as this summer, he had already sounded out European allies on his inclination to extend the  treaty (to include China?) or withdraw from it completely. \u201cAsked for comment on the future of the INF, a senior administration official said: \u201cAcross two administrations, the United States and our allies have attempted to bring Russia back into full and verifiable compliance with INF. Despite our objections, Russia continues to produce and field prohibited cruise misses and has ignored calls for transparency.\u201d \u201cThe US has started to brief allies with the possibility of withdrawal. But I don\u2019t believe there has been any kind of interagency process in the administration,\u201d said Jon Wolfsthal, a former senior director for non-proliferation and arms control at the NSC. The Trump administration\u2019s Nuclear Posture Review, released in February, called for the US to do research on its own ground-launched medium-range missiles as a way of pressuring Moscow back into INF compliance. It did not advocate leaving the treaty. That review was completed before Bolton came to the White House and he is now seeking to toughen the administration\u2019s nuclear stance further. Over the summer he brought into the White House another hardliner on arms control, Tim Morrison, the former Republican policy director on the House armed services committee, and between them they have taken the lead on arms control issues away from the state department. Provisional plans had been made to resume a strategic stability dialogue in September, led on the US side by Andrea Thompson, the under secretary for arms control at the state department and the Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov.\u201c Wow, New York Times finally broke an actual story. https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/19/us/politics/russia-nuclear-arms-treaty-trump-administration.html\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/19/john-bolton-russia-nuclear-arms-deal-trump-lobbying I\u2019m at 51% because Q timeline is quite long, and Q resolves on any result of formal negotiation, including staying, leaving for something new,  or amending.

We have consulted on this issue, and we will continue these consultations with other participants in this negotiation process. O. Bychkova\n- Why does this topic arise right now? Why not before? Why not a year ago, for example? D. Bolton\n- You know, the questions that we have now clarified, they have been discussed for some time, for a long time, so to speak. Maybe even 5 years in the United States these issues are, because Russia has violated the treaty on strategic offensive arms, on missile defense. And this was the position of the Obama Administration that it is necessary to change relations with Russia in this matter. And we concluded that Russia intends to develop medium-range missiles. And given this position of Russia, its intentions, this is one of the possible restrictions and violations of the treaty on the limitation of strategic weapons.

And it turns out a very unusual configuration, the situation for the United States and Russia: a bilateral agreement is no longer a monopoly agreement, do you understand? By a comprehensive agreement, let's say, as it was in the days of the Soviet Union.\nD. Bolton\n- Yes. And this is one of the reasons why we began the process of consultation with our European allies. And also with Asian partners. There are friends, allies - they are worried about the position of China. They were very unhappy to hear that decisions are not made without their participation. I have been doing this before, and now I am doing it. I was in Moscow in 2001, one of the leading negotiators for the missile defense treaty. And we went through all these reactions and processes of consultation and then, as now it happens. O. Bychkova\n- And what does China think about this? D. Bolton\n- The position of China over the past 24 hours has been determined: the Chinese really hope that the Americans will not withdraw from the ABM treaty. If I were Chinese, I would say the same thing. The Chinese are not parties to this treaty, and they want it to continue. O. Bychkova\n- And what will happen with the START Treaty? D. Bolton\n- Understand, the US government is now considering its position on the new Start and START treaty. And we discussed this issue with Nikolai Patrushev. We had talks in Geneva in August on this issue. We discussed various options for a new treaty on strategic offensive arms, but the US government has not yet developed its position. We are ready to negotiate, now, while now there is time for this process. We understand the Russian position now better, and we want to further clarify it, to see its details. O. Bychkova\n- And he will continue? D. Bolton\n- Yes, the contract is valid until 2021, so we still have a lot of time.\nO. Bychkova\n- Good. And tell me, please, what is the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed Ibn Salman, better than Putin? D. Bolton\n- I don't know anyone who could figure this out better than Mr. Putin. O. Bychkova\n- Well, from your point of view? Because in Saudi Arabia there are political assassinations, cyber attacks, political pressure on opponents, dictatorship. In 2001, President Bush looked into President Putin\u2019s eyes and saw his soul. D. Bolton\n- Looked into the soul of man, yes, through his eyes. O. Bychkova\n- Yes! And now it turns out that Trump sees the soul of Prince Salman, but not the soul of Putin. D. Bolton\n- Do you mean Mohammed Ben Salman? You know, the president said and repeatedly spoke out on this issue. He demands truth from the crown prince. We want to know the truth, and not, so to speak, talk. Why he died, first, we need to know. Who killed him? We want to know all the ins and outs of this process. Therefore, after returning from Saudi Arabia, the situation continues to be uncertain. We demand clarity, we are conducting these negotiations. Therefore, this question is still hanging. O. Bychkova\n- But you can imagine that something happens without the knowledge of the Crown Prince? D. Bolton\n- You know, I would not speculate about those things that we do not know. I am a lawyer by training, so I love working with facts, not with speculation. We spoke directly with the president and the crown prince that any participation in this matter should be investigated. And this consequence must be carried out carefully. And Secretary of State Pompeo is in contact with the Saudis, and this work is continuing on the consultations. O. Bychkova\n- And if, nevertheless, it turns out that the prince is related to this murder, what do you think should be done with the Saudis? What should be adequate answers? D. Bolton\n- Again, I would not like to hypothetically address this question, whether the crown prince is involved in this or is not involved in this case. So ... As I said, I would not make assumptions here. O. Bychkova\n- The US Department of Justice indicted the Russian woman for Russia's intervention in the 2018 American elections. What do you think is the most effective way to stop Russia? D. Bolton\n- I raised this issue today at the talks. I understand the Russian position on this issue. O. Bychkova\n- The American Justice Ministry indicted a Russian woman for Russia's interference in the American elections. What do you think is the most effective way to stop Russia?\nD. Bolton\n- You know, I raised this issue during the negotiations on Russia's intervention in the elections. I know the Russian position on this issue. Russian citizens are indeed condemned by the American courts for their actions if, indeed, it is proved that they are guilty. On the issue, in particular, about interference in the electoral process. I told our Russian colleagues today that I do not think from the point of view of their interference in our electoral process had any real effect. But another is important. The very desire to interfere in our affairs causes distrust of the Russians, of Russia. And I believe that it is impossible to tolerate, it should not be permissible. Therefore, such a cold-blooded, insolent intervention in the electoral process will be condemned with American legal entities. O. Bychkova\n- And did you discuss this today? D. Bolton\n- Yes, discussed. I expressed my position. O. BYCHKOVA\n- US imposes sanctions against Russia, but sanctions against Iran led to an increase in oil prices, which significantly helps Moscow to survive the US sanctions. What for? Why help Putin? D.Bolton\n- What do we do on Iran, it is because we believe that the Iranians are continuing to develop nuclear weapons. We do not think that they strategically abandoned it. And the same thing applies to international terrorism. Therefore, US sanctions in this sense should put maximum pressure on Tehran to change their behavior. One of the main problems is the sanctions that were imposed then, in early November. Many companies were waiting for the sanctions to be introduced, and they prepared in advance, starting to work with the procurement of Iranian oil, controlling markets and pricing. We ourselves entered the market, throwing out additional volumes of crude oil so that we could compensate for sanctions against Iran. President Trump certainly thinks about this better than many others, so we are increasing our own production and emissions to world oil markets. But the importance of these major changes in Iranian politics is our priority. Indeed, it is true that Russia, as an oil exporter, will benefit from rising oil prices. And we benefit from this as oil producers. But over time, the market will level off. O. Bychkova\n- Is it true that last year the American administration actively discussed the idea of \u200b\u200ba nuclear strike on North Korea? What do you think of it? D. Bolton\n- No, of course! No no no. Of course, the United States - well, definitely not. This is not a question and never discussed question, as far as I know. And I think that President Trump has clearly said that he will continue negotiations and this is the main direction of American foreign policy in this matter. I think we discussed this during the summit with the Koreans. And we are doing everything we need in order for North Korea to fulfill its obligations.

It's hard to say what Trump has or hasn't agreed on, but it does seem possible that even with general disapproval, skepticism, or criticism from the people who actually have to ratify any treat negotiated or signed by President Trump's team, a formal negotiation may very easily be started.  Given the timeline, I'm willing to keep it higher than 0-2%, but especially since Trump's ADHD method of political focus tends to shift quickly when he's bored or unhappy, and this seems to be something that would be good strategically for Russia (negotiate a treaty they haven't been following and don't plan to follow, but which the US will dither over violating as it would justify a bigger public reaction from Russia if the US did violate it even in any reasonable way), and I wouldn't put it above Putin to suggest opening negotiations, nor would I expect Trump to ignore Putin or respond negatively if Putin did reachd out.  By itself, I don't think it's the kind of thing Trump would lay plans for or care much about without prompting; it doesn't have any particular popular support nor connect to any prestige associations Trump would otherwise value, and it seems that pretty much no one with any power or sensibility thinks it would be useful to continue: the military is moving away already because they have to plan for the actual future that's presenting itself, and the attitude here and abroad is very much shaping up to building arsenals and strengthening world partners or partisans (except the US and Europe, it seems). https://freebeacon.com/national-security/trump-leaning-extending-arms-treaty/\nTrump administration officials expressed doubts the 2010 New START arms treaty will be extended over concerns about Moscow's failure to comply with that and several other arms treaties.  The Pentagon, meanwhile, is moving ahead with designing a new ground-based missile to counter Russia's illegal cruise missiles built in violation of the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Force (INF) Treaty.  Andrea Thompson, undersecretary of state for arms control and international security, told a Senate hearing Tuesday that Russia's new strategic weapons announced in February, are a factor in whether the United States will seek to extend New START.  \"No decision's been made at this time,\" she told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \"All options are on the table.\" Among the options being considered are withdrawing from New START; re-negotiating inspection and verification provisions as part of treaty extension; or adopting a more limited and simple agreement similar to the 2002 Moscow Treaty that called for significant reductions in strategic offensive arms.  \"Among issues to consider will be Russia's decision to manufacture compliance issues regarding U.S. weapons, and the uncertainty of whether or not Russia's recently announced strategic nuclear weapons will be held accountable under the treaty,\" Thompson explained in her prepared testimony. In response to U.S. questioning of Russian treaty violations, Moscow has responded with disinformation and false counter charges of U.S. noncompliance.  \"Russia's response to each of these situations is to employ its standard playbook of distraction, misinformation, and counter-accusations,\" Thompson said.   David Trachtenberg, deputy undersecretary of defense for policy, also said extension of New START is uncertain.  \"Any decision on extending the treaty will, and should be, based on a realistic assessment of whether the New START treaty remains in our national security interests in light of overall Russian arms control behavior,\" Trachtenberg testified.  Trachtenberg said the arms treaty provides for on-site inspections and monitoring that are useful and beneficial. However, he added: \"That said, what I find particularly troubling is the overall nature of Russian arms control behavior and what the Russians seem to be doing in terms of selectively complying with various provisions of treaties and selectively non-complying with others when they feel it's not in their interest.\" Russia has launched a large-scale nuclear modernization that includes new missiles and submarines in addition to new revolutionary arms.  The United States is investing more than $1.2 trillion over the next 30 years to modernize its aging nuclear forces, including new ground-based missiles, new missile submarines, and a new bomber.  Russian President Vladimir Putin in February disclosed several new strategic weapons systems violate new START.  The new arms include nuclear-armed hypersonic cruise missiles, a long-range nuclear-powered missile, and an underwater drone submarine capable of delivering a massive, multi-megaton nuclear warhead. Under New START, Russia is obligated to notify the United States that the new weapons are under development and will be counted under the treaty. Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) asked Thompson whether the announced new Russian weapons are covered under New START.  \"They would count as strategic weapons,\" she said, noting that the Russians have not made any notification of the new weapons.  Thompson also said the new strategic weapons under development by Russia have not been discussed in U.S.-Russian arms talks and she could not say if the U.S. side had asked the Russians about the New START-accountable weapons.  Rubio said that Putin's speech describing new strategic weapons should have triggered someone in charge of arms control to question the Russians about them and \"if that's true, you need to notify that [because] that violates START.\"  \"Senator we're taking action on it. We haven't done it through the formal New START process with our counterparts,\" Thompson said.  Rubio later commended Thompson for recognizing the need to determine whether Russia\u2019s new arms are covered under New START before any decision is made on extending the treaty.  \"These new kinds of strategic arms could be destabilizing, so the United States must directly raise its concerns about these emerging systems with the Russian Federation at every opportunity, if it truly hasn\u2019t done so already,\" Rubio told the Washington Free Beacon. Republicans and Democrats on the committee appeared divided over whether to extend New START.  Sen. Bob Menendez (D., N.J.) suggested that abandoning New START in 2021 could prompt the Pentagon to seek a \"larger and more expensive nuclear force.\"  Sen. James Risch, (R., Idaho), said he opposed the New START treaty when it was ratified by the Senate in 2010 and noted the difficulty of dealing with the Russians on any arms accords.  \"Trying to negotiate with people who are not negotiating in good faith is a problem,\" Risch said.  Risch opposed New START because \"I don't have any confidence that [the Russians] are negotiating in good faith,\" he said.  \"They're serial cheaters. They're serial liars and you have to look at the other things they are doing in the world to judge what kind of a mind these people have as far as whether they're acting in good faith,\" Risch said.   Thompson said in addition to the INF violations and potential New START violations, Moscow violated a ban on the use of chemical weapons in conducting the assassination attempt against a Russian defector and his daughter in England.  ...Moscow also is tacitly supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's use of chemical weapons attacks in Syria, she noted.  Trachtenberg said New START was concluded with the idea of building better relations with Russia. Since then, ties have deteriorated and \"we must be clear eyed about the threats we face,\" he said. In addition to INF and New START issues, Russia also is not adhering to the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty, the Budapest Memorandum on security assurances, the Helsinki Accords, and the Presidential Nuclear Initiatives on tactical nuclear arms, he said.  Moscow also is violating the Open Skies Treaty while selectively implementing the Vienna Document on exchanges of military information, Trachtenberg said.   Committee Chairman Sen. Bob Corker (R., Tenn.)said: \"Out of four agreements\u2014New START, the INF Treaty, the Open Skies Treaty, and the Chemical Weapons Convention\u2014we have significant problems with Russian compliance of three of them.\"  On the INF violation, Moscow is in material breach of the accord for deploying significant numbers of a new, intermediate-range, ground-launched cruise missiles called the SSC-8.  Thompson said the Trump administration has used diplomatic, military, and economic steps to pressure Russia to return to INF compliance.  Under recent legislation, the Pentagon is conducting INF treaty-compliant research into a new ground based missile that \"if completed, would be noncompliant with INF,\" she said.  \"This system is designed to be a direct counter to Russia, and the United States has made it clear that we will cease pursuing its development if Russia returns to compliance with the treaty,\" Thompson said.  Two Russian defense contractors involved in the SSC-8 missile, Novator Design Bureau and Titan Central Design Bureau, were sanctioned in September. \"The lack of any meaningful steps by Russia to return to compliance diminishes our hope that Russia has any interest in preserving the INF Treaty, despite Moscow\u2019s public statements to the contrary,\" Thompson noted. https://www.voanews.com/a/us-officials-express-doubts-on-future-of-nuke-pact-with-russia-/4576979.html\n...Several senators noted that U.S. lawmakers still don't know details of a private meeting in July between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki.  \"We remain largely in the dark as to what the two leaders discussed or agreed to during their two hour closed session,\" Menendez said. \"We do know that the Russian Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov told reporters that important verbal agreements were reached at the Helsinki summit on arms control issues.\"  Menendez added, \"Has the president reached key decisions with Russia on arms control treaties?

Moscow and Washington have been holding closed-door consultations on implementing the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF Treaty) and the New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty), Russian Ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov said, addressing a session of the Valdai International Discussion Club on Friday.\n          Putin calls for work to commence immediately on extending New START treaty\nAccording to him, the New START treaty is still in line with both countries\u2019 interests. \"The question is what is to be done, since the document will expire in 2021. We need this document and our president has put it clearly that we are ready to consider extending it,\" the Russian ambassador pointed out.\n          \"We have some questions concerning Washington\u2019s implementation of the treaty. We have been holding consultations with the US regarding our concerns, they are closed-door consultations,\" he said. \"We have also been sending notes through the Russian Foreign Ministry\u2019s channels, saying that problems still remain,\" he noted, adding that \"the Americans need to assess Russia\u2019s proposal and give a response about extending the document.\"  ... But it seems as though their questions are more preliminary (Is the US even going to meet the expectations of the current New START treaty) and not negotiating terms to the next one.\nhttp://tass.com/politics/1013798 Today Putin invited Trump to Moscow and, among other things, said, \"In Helsinki, we talked about the issues in which our states have a real stake. In 2021, the New Start treaty expires,\" he said, referring to a nuclear arms control treaty.  ...Are we going to extend it or not? Russia and the United States have a stake in that, the whole word has a stake in that, in not starting an arms race. If we don't start talks in 2021, the treaty will cease to exist.  ...Yes, we have contacts on a working level, but sometimes that's not enough, we need contacts at the highest political level.\" https://www.firstpost.com/world/russias-putin-tells-trump-be-my-guest-in-moscow-4838841.html   As Russian press reported after Helsinki, Russia is interested in discussions on New START and Syria/Middle East (now maybe Iran also?) and Trump has said that he is \"open\" to going.  https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44983285.  If they do begin discussions, I think timing works against them.  Republicans weren't generally enthusiastic about Helsinki, and although Trump generally pushes through things he wants or things his base / paying supporters want without regard to how it will rebound on him, I'm not sure how much he (or Putin) will care about New Start, though beginning formal discussions doesn't mean reaching a final agreement. I'm a little concerned that formal negotiations might not end up being publicized until after the fact, given the current administration's preference for and interest in closed-door meetings and secrecy to do what they wish rather than announce it and let public opinion shape the outcome.  Especially since this has been referenced multiple times since the Helsinki summit by Russian press but never even mentioned in US newspapers.  I suppose that, like the North Korea meetings, even phone conferences and scheduled discussions would still be known and rumored and perhaps require other US officials to meet or travel to discuss this. For now, other agencies seem to be looking forward as if discussions are likely to happen, even though we haven't heard much about it yet:\nhttps://www.europeanleadershipnetwork.org/commentary/post-helsinki-opportunities-for-new-start-and-the-inf-treaty/\nhttps://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2018/07/27/u-s-russia-relations-and-a-second-trump-putin-summit/"], [32258, "2018-07-27T17:05:34Z", [0.85], "https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2018-05/news/administration-review-new-start\n----------------------------------------\nPosted May 1, 2018\nThe Trump administration plans to conduct an interagency review on whether to extend the 2010 New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) with Russia, according to two Trump administration officials. Robert Soofer, deputy assistant secretary of defense for nuclear and missile defense policy, told the Senate Armed Services Committee on April 11 that the review would begin soon and assess the \u201cpros and cons\u201d of extending the treaty. Expiration of the accord in 2021, without a replacement, would remove numerical caps on U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals for the first time since the 1970s.\nFriedt noted that if the treaty expires with nothing to replace it, \u201cthen we will have less insight\u201d into Russia\u2019s nuclear forces. But she hinted that the administration will take its time before making its decision. An early extension would not \u201cnecessarily help\u201d improve the U.S.-Russian arms control relationship, she said. \u201cWe have until 2021, and I think we should look at it\nvery carefully.\u201d Some Republican members of Congress, such as Sen. Tom Cotton (Ark.), have expressed concern about a potential extension given Russia\u2019s violation of other arms control agreements and development of new nuclear weapons delivery systems not limited by New START. \u201cGiven that set of circumstances, I think we should take a serious second look at extending\u201d New START, he said at an April 11 Senate hearing. The House-passed version of the fiscal year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act would have prohibited the use of funds to extend New START unless Russia returns to compliance with the INF Treaty. (See ACT, September 2017.)

Preliminary talks were already held in Rome on 27 April, although it was originally planned to have them held in the middle of May.\" So if we consider now the current situation a bit. Putin called Trump about START re-processing. (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-putin-idUSKBN15O2A5) at the time it seemed that Trump didn't really know what it was about. Personally I begin to agree with the top specialists and diplomats about Trump's poor ability to negotiate in these matters (even though we can't deny the fact that he is one hell of a business man), but when it comes to Putin, he is a tactic with clever mind who is able to pull the strings of many, in my point of view Trump is hanging in these strings. Trump and Putin held a summit in Helsinki in 16.7.2018. In the public speech they covered the topic of denuclearization and world speech. (Finnish newspaper: https://www.hs.fi/ulkomaat/art-2000005759405.html) It seemed that they were only trying to speak to their voters. I would say that Putin sees it one the most important tasks now. But the question is whether there will be \"formal negotiations before October 2019?\" I'd say consider the previous process of START. It began right after the meeting between Obama and Medvedev. So if nothing happens in the next upcoming, let's say six months, I might decrease my chances on the matter.

In general I think this is likely to make US opinion even more mistrustful and reciprocal in nature.  However, President Trump has shown himself to be much more likely to be less concerned and more lenient toward Russian than the average American or US politician.  So I suppose it's possible.  Still, I think a more aggressive attitude on both sides is more likely than careful diplomatic discussions, as neither side benefits politically right now from a public discourse of relaxed tensions or peaceful diplomacy, even if we would all benefit from real checks that encourage safety.   Although I think neither side wants actual conflict, the appearance of readiness and reciprocal strength is appealing, and discussions about possible plans for negotiations help moderate that risk somewhat.  But not only does setting up formal negotiations usually take time, I think neither side is likely to agree to begin negotiations until they feel like they are in a rather stronger position than they are now.  Also, actually setting up and going to negotiations (or worse, agreeing to them) also limits some of the nationalistic pride felt (especially in Russia, but also growing in the US) at being a major economic and political world player that others have reason to treat cautiously.  If someone like Obama were in office, I'd put the likelihood much higher, since he preferred moderated, diplomatic foreign policy.  But Trump generally prefers to negotiate things he's sure he can win or look good at negotiating even if they fall through.  He might look good negotiating with Putin (and Putin could agree if he thought he could look like he was playing Trump) and managing a show of being someone who knows the right people and how to make deals that win points, but I don't see Putin needing such a treaty as much as the US and I think Trump is more likely to talk about than do it.  That's because ultimately I think Trump is more likely to look weaker through such negotiations than stronger.  Trump is far less interested in the pragmatics than the theatrics of politics and policies.   Likely the existing treaty will stand with a lot of talk and little move toward formal negotiations for some time.  So maybe by next Fall negotiations are possible, especially as the 10 year mark of the New START treaty approaches.  But if there is a move toward this, I don't think anything will be seriously discussed concerning \"formal negotiations\" until either late this year or early Spring next year.  And I think it's more likely that talk will be extended and real negotiations delayed, and as they get more realistic, more cautions and criticisms will come out about them and what it means.
