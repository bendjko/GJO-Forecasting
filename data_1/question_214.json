Pence can take responsibility for the recovery of Indiana's economy, which is tenuous but we know how politicians play things. Things are now tricky, if picked for VP he cannot be governor. Thus beyond considering whether he will just be re-elected there is the consideration of whether Trump will pick him as VP. This makes it very difficult, Trump has no political track record in choosing people, staffers, etc. Also hard to gauge to what degree the GOP are making the shortlist and Trump just gets to pick.  Trump has said he wants someone political, that can help pass through legislation and also well connected. That provides many options.\nSo I need to forecast whether Mike Pence will be the VP pick, and then as a consequence forecast his re-election. I will give him a 28% chance of being the VP pick given the wide range of people Trump has spoken to - so make his chance of re-election 72% then take some off from that given the tightness of the race and the aforementioned factors.
