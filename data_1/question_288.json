By measuring and analysing the shock waves caused by the blasts, and picked up by quake stations in China and neighbouring countries, researchers at the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei, Anhui province, said they were confident that they were all carried out from under the same mountain at the Punggye-ri test site.\nThis file handout picture obtained in April from French space agency National Centre for Space Studies shows a satellite image of North Korea's Punggye-ri nuclear test site, Photo: AFP\nNorth Korea tests nuclear bomb it says can be made into warhead for long-range missile The team from the seismic and deep earth physics laboratory made the claim in a statement posted on their website on Monday. Its leader, geophysicist Wen Lianxing, said that based on data collected by more than 100 earthquake monitoring centres in China, the margin of error was no more than 100 metres.\nWang Naiyan, the former chairman of the China Nuclear Society and senior researcher on China\u2019s nuclear weapons programme, said that if Wen\u2019s findings were reliable, there was a risk of a major environmental disaster. Another test might cause the whole mountain to cave in on itself, leaving only a hole from which radiation could escape and drift across the region, including China, he said.\n\u201cWe call it \u2018taking the roof off\u2019. If the mountain collapses and the hole is exposed, it will let out many bad things.\u201d\nSunday\u2019s blast was followed by an earthquake eight minutes later, which China\u2019s seismic authorities interpreted as a cave-in triggered by the explosion.\nHow China responded to previous North Korean nuclear tests Not every mountain was suitable for nuclear bomb testing. Wang said, adding that the peak had to be high, but the slopes relatively flat.\nBased on the fact that North Korea has a limited land area and bearing in mind the sensitivity of its nuclear programme, it most likely does not have too many suitable peaks to choose from.\nHow long the mountain would continue to stand would also depend on where the North Koreans placed the bombs, Wang said.\n\u201cIf the bombs were planted at the bottom of vertically drilled tunnels, the explosion would do less damage,\u201d he said.\nBut vertical tunnels were difficult and expensive to build, and it was not easy to lay cables and sensors to collect data from the explosion, he said. Much easier was to bore a horizontal tunnel into the heart of the mountain, but this increased the risk of blowing off the top, he said.\nChina and Russia unite against North Korean nuclear test The increasing size of North Korea\u2019s nuclear bombs was also making \u201ctopping\u201d more likely, Wang said. \u201cA 100 kiloton bomb is a relatively large bomb. The North Korean government should stop the tests as they pose a huge threat not only to North Korea but to other countries, especially China,\u201d he said.\nWang added a caveat, however, saying that the calculations made by Wen and his team could be wrong. Quake waves travel at different speeds through different rocks, so it was not easy to make precise predictions based on seismic data, he said.\nIn the meantime, Chinese authorities, including the National Nuclear Safety Administration, would continue to closely monitor every nuclear test conducted by North Korea, Wang said.\nRadiation readings taken by the government on Monday showed nothing out of the ordinary.\nWen\u2019s team estimated that the energy released in the latest test was about 108.3 kilotons of TNT, or 7.8 times the amount released by the atomic bomb dropped by the US on the Japanese city Hiroshima in 1945. It also dwarfed all previous bombs tested by the North Korean military.\nNo radiation detected outside North Korea after nuclear test, say China, Japan\" Not constrained in development of nuke wmd and missiles at all\ndespite http://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2109533/china-condemns-north-korean-nuclear-test has miniaturized boosted warhead- does not have re entry yet-close 6-12 months\nmore icbm testing\nno real icbms yet \nbut a big part of Kim Jong Uns game \nis to threaten US with ICBM with deliverable wmd big part of plan threaten US neutralize US \nper ROK and Japan\nROK deployed THAAD today passed enviro permits\nso  this could decouple ROK US Japan\nthen ROK Japan get nukes\nnot good. for PRC\nbut the oil and gas that flow through Donghan continues\nthe tests stop for now\nlots of icbms"], [368, "2017-09-04T21:33:57Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2017-09-04T17:46:56Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [30364, "2017-09-04T16:21:54Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [53, "2017-09-04T14:23:41Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2017-09-04T12:04:33Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [31802, "2017-09-04T07:51:50Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [13377, "2017-09-04T07:10:46Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [30364, "2017-09-04T06:22:13Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [38675, "2017-09-04T02:38:36Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.85, 0.15], "according to al jazeera."], [23006, "2017-09-03T22:28:48Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.51, 0.49], ""], [484, "2017-09-03T21:39:47Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.7, 0.3], "(no change) Good summary (for a very short article): http://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/03/world/asia/north-korea-hydrogen-bomb.html Prodded by something like this there is a good chance reporters will delve a bit more and use some of the excellent online source material.

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un inspected an H-bomb, which can be fit on its ICBM during his visit to the Nuclear Weapons Institute, the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said. The institute has succeeded in making a \"more developed nuke,\" bringing about a \"signal turn\" in the country's nuclear weaponization, according to the report. Scientists \"further upgraded its technical performance at a higher ultra-modern level on the basis of precious successes made in the first H-bomb test,\" the KCNA said in an English dispatch. The H-bomb can be detonated even at high altitudes for extremely powerful EMP attacks, it added. \"All components of the H-bomb were homemade, and all the processes ranging from the production of weapons-grade nuclear materials to precision processing of components and their assembling were put on the Juche basis, thus enabling the country to produce powerful nuclear weapons as many as it wants, \" it added. Juche is its state ideology meaning self-reliance. In January 2016, North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test, which Pyongyang claimed to be a successful test of a hydrogen bomb. Outside experts said that it appeared to be a test of a boosted fission weapon, rather than an H-bomb. North Korea has carried out five nuclear tests since 2006, including two last year. It is seeking to develop a nuclear weapon small enough to be mounted on an ICBM. The announcement came amid heightened tensions after North Korea fired an intermediate-range ballistic missile over Japan last week. In July, North Korea tested two ICBMs, which analysts say could put much of the U.S. mainland within range, including Los Angeles and Chicago\n. NOT EVEN CLOSE\nSee SEOUL, Sept. 2 (Yonhap) -- North Korea said Saturday that any South Korean and United States attempt to locate its mobile missile launchers would be futile, issuing sarcastic remarks on a recent South Korean military drill to detect and destroy the North's transporter-erector-launcher (TEL). The South Korean Navy's special warfare troops carried out training to infiltrate into enemy territory and locate and destroy the North's TELs in the east coast region on Aug. 24, as part of the annual Ulchi-Freedom Guardian exercises held jointly with the U.S. The North has used TELs to move a ballistic missile and stand it upright to avoid surveillance by spy satellites. The Rodong Sinmun, the mouthpiece of the North's ruling Workers' Party, said in a commentary that the South Korean military's Aug. 24 drills targeting TELs was nothing but \"laughable.\"    \"Our strategic weapons are ready to thoroughly annihilate the strongholds of aggression and provocation from any unpredictable region and place anytime,\" said the commentary. \"The U.S. and Japan have mobilized all their intelligence assets for 24-hour surveillance on us but failed to detect the launch time and place of our ballistic missiles.\"    It then noted that even the U.S. highly evaluated the North Korean military for its camouflage, concealment and deception capabilities. \"Any attempt by the puppets to detect and destroy our TELs in advance is nothing but a silly dream. The puppets in South Korea will never avoid catastrophes as long as they continue to run amok,\" said the commentary. Another commentary in the same North Korean newspaper also harshly condemned Japan's moves to reinforce its missile defense systems to intercept the North's ballistic missiles. ycm@yna.co.kr\nH Bomb Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Site???\nnot in  the middle of Nevada desert and on this whole package testing  issue\n2 Los Alamos National Laboratory\nNational Security Science July 2014 3\nJoseph Martz, a technical staff member at Los Alamos since the 1980s, has\nheld a variety of positions during his 20 years in the Lab\u2019s Weapons Program.\nHis responsibilities have included leadership of the pit technology group,\nmanagement of enhanced surveillance in the Stockpile Stewardship Program,\nleadership of the weapon design division, and project head for the Reliable\nReplacement Warhead. NSS asked Martz for his thoughts on stockpile\nstewardship and its evolution over the last two decades. begin Martz \"Stockpile stewardship is a topic dear to my heart. I\u2019ve been fascinated by it, and I\u2019ve lived\nit\u2014mostly on the technical side but also on the policy side. From 2009 to 2010 at Stanford\nUniversity, I was a visiting scholar and the inaugural William J. Perry Fellow, working\nwith Perry, former secretary of defense, and Sig Hecker, former Los Alamos Lab director\n(1986\u20131997). Together we looked at nuclear deterrence, nuclear policy, and stockpile\nstewardship and at where all this was headed.\nThe Nuclear World Changes\nIn my career, the years from 1989 to 1992 were the most consequential period with respect to\nnuclear weapons. Three very important things happened during those years, and they led to\nprofound changes in U.S. nuclear policy. First, we had the fall of the Soviet Union, presaged by\nthe fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. The USSR dissolved on December 25, 1991, and the collapse\nof the USSR changed everything. The Cold War and its nuclear arms race were over, making an\nanachronism of MAD [Mutual Assured Destruction], the policy whereby, to deter nuclear war,\nthe United States and the Soviet Union each deployed enough nuclear weapons to ensure the\ncomplete destruction of the other.\nSecond, in 1989 the government halted work at the Rocky Flats Plant, outside of Denver,\nColorado, where plutonium pits for primaries [the nuclear triggers for thermonuclear\nweapons] were produced. That turned out to be a seminal moment in the history of the nuclear\nweapons complex because, frankly, it ended our ability to produce new weapons and effectively\nshut down the entire nuclear weapons production complex! Over the next 10 years, more than\n50 percent of the historic nuclear weapons complex was shuttered forever.\nThird, the Soviet Union had proposed a moratorium on nuclear testing and conducted its last\ntest on October 24, 1990. \u201cDivider,\u201d conducted on September 23, 1992, was the United States\u2019\nlast nuclear test. Shortly thereafter a moratorium on testing was legislatively mandated and has\nbeen followed by the United States.\nDETONATION\nFROM THE BOTTOM UP\nAn unarmed Minuteman III ICBM is launched out of a silo during a test at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California.\n(Photo: U.S. Air Force)\n4 Los Alamos National Laboratory\nAny one of those changes would have radically altered how\nthe Lab carried out its national security mission, but all\nthree events together put the Lab in unprecedented territory:\ninstead of designing and engineering new weapons for the\nnuclear stockpile, it would now maintain the stockpile. But\nthe cessation of nuclear testing meant the loss of the most\nimportant tool the weapons designers had used for 50 years\nto develop nuclear weapons and to ensure that the stockpile\nwas safe, secure, and reliable.\nBetween 1989 and 1992, three\nevents put Los Alamos in\nunprecedented territory.\nIn addition to closing the factories and putting a moratorium\non testing, we\u2019d also agreed not to develop new weapons.\nThat meant we\u2019d lose the means that, along with nuclear\ntesting, had developed and maintained the skills of weapons\ndesigners: the continued design and production of new,\nupgraded nuclear weapons. However, maintaining the\ndesigners\u2019 skills is vital because although the Cold War is\nover, shifts in global politics have engendered new national\nsecurity needs such as protecting the weapons with enhanced\nsecurity measures in the post-9/11 world. How were we going\nto manage an aging stockpile and remain agile in the face of\nchanging national security needs?\nInventing \u201cScience-Based\u201d Stewardship\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, President Bill Clinton\ncommissioned the first Nuclear Posture Review to examine\nthe role of nuclear weapons in a post-Soviet world. This\nreview (and every review since) reaffirmed the continued\nneed for U.S. nuclear deterrence, while also recognizing the\nchanging conditions and constraints in the global security\nenvironment. For itself and its allies, the United States would\ncontinue to maintain its nuclear stockpile, and nuclear\ndeterrence would remain a central element of our supreme\nnational security posture. But that presented the nuclear\nweapons laboratories with a huge technical challenge. How\ncould the nuclear weapons labs ensure that nuclear weapons\nremained safe, secure, and reliable in the absence of\nnuclear testing?\nThe question was particularly important because the weapons\nwere going to enter configurations that we had no experience\nwith; that is, because we weren\u2019t continuing production, the\nweapons we had would, by default, age beyond their design\nlife. Could we and our allies rely on these complicated weapons\nin spite of their aging? We would have to understand how\nage affected the weapons\u2019 performance, safety, and security\nand do that without any further nuclear testing.\nThis also meant finding new ways to train next-generation\ndesigners without the live tests the first generation had used.\nHow could we and our allies rely\non these aging weapons in the absence\nof further nuclear testing?\nRethinking Mission \u201cHow To\u2019s\u201d\nClearly, we had to rethink the entire problem of meeting our\nnational security mission. Leading that process was Vic Reis,\nwho at that time was assistant secretary for the Department\nof Energy (DOE) Defense Programs. He would be assisted by\nthe directors of the three DOE weapons laboratories.\nThe lab directors, with Reis\u2019s guidance, convened technical\nexperts from across the DOE weapons complex, and what the\nexperts came up with was the realization that maintaining the\nstockpile would require an approach that was the complete\ninverse of the one used during testing. I\u2019ll explain what\nthat means.\nThe1989 fall of the Berlin Wall was the beginning of the end of the Cold War.\n(Photo: Open source)\nContinued on p. 6\nNuclear weapons are complex devices operating at the\nextremes of physics, chemistry, and materials science.\nThe temperature, pressure, velocity, density, and energy\nproduced in a nuclear detonation are essentially\nunprecedented in human experience. Furthermore,\nthe need to ensure the safety and security of nuclear\ndevices leads to a great paradox: the weapon must\nbe designed to ensure that its exceptional destructive\npower does not manifest itself when not desired but\nalways does when required. And all the components\nthat produce both results must be designed to fit\nwithin a volume and mass of material smaller than a\nkitchen stove.\nA nuclear detonation can be viewed as a series of\ncascading, compounding events, each of which helps\namplify energy production for use in the next main\nstage. A modern thermonuclear weapon has two main\nstages: the primary and the secondary. The primary is\nessentially a fission bomb that releases energy from a\nrunaway fission chain reaction. That energy reaches\nthe secondary, setting it off. The fuel in the secondary\nundergoes both fission and thermonuclear fusion and\nreleases hundreds to thousands of times more energy\nthan a fission bomb does.\nDetonation of a modern thermonuclear weapon begins with an electrical signal to the\nprimary, a signal that is scrupulously controlled to ensure it is transmitted only when there\nis certainty that a detonation is desired. This signal fires detonators in the primary that ignite\na small charge of explosives, which in turn ignites the primary\u2019s main charge of explosives.\nThe symmetrical detonation of this main charge is essential for compressing a pit of fissile\nmaterial\u2014material capable of undergoing nuclear fission\u2014into a supercritical mass.\nPlutonium and uranium are the fissile materials most often used to make pits. When the pit is\ncompressed into a supercritical mass, a runaway fission chain reaction takes off, generating\ntremendous amounts of energy very rapidly.\nThe energy from the primary is manifested as radiation, such as x-ray and neutron radiation.\nThis radiation heats the weapon to temperatures exceeding the temperature of the sun. In\nmodern, two-stage thermonuclear weapons, the primary\u2019s radiation is reflected from the\nradiation case onto the secondary, a component containing both fission and fusion fuels. The\ntremendous amount of radiation energy absorbed by the secondary creates a crushing shock\nwave that compresses the secondary into a state that produces vast amounts of fission, fusion,\nand radiation energy.\nThe yield from the secondary greatly exceeds what the primary can create. In an atmospheric\ndetonation, the vast amount of radiation energy is absorbed by the air, creating a fireball that\nemanates thermal radiation and a tremendous shock wave, the sources of the direct damage\nfrom a nuclear explosion. Other effects of the nuclear detonation include direct radiation,\nboth x-rays and neutrons, as well as nuclear fallout in the form of fission products.\nNuclear Weapons 101\nImplosion\nPlutonium pit\nChemical\nexplosive\nImploding Primary\nModern Thermonuclear Weapon\nPrimary Secondary\nReentry vehicle\nRadiation Case\nNational Security Science July 2014 5\n6 Los Alamos National Laboratory\nFrom the Bottom Up\nNuclear testing was a wonderful tool. It was also the world\u2019s\nbiggest shortcut. It meant that we didn\u2019t have to understand\nall the details of a nuclear weapon and how it functions. (See\n\u201cNuclear Weapons 101.\u201d) During the nuclear testing era, we\nknew enough about how things work and how materials\nbehave to configure a device and make a prediction as to how\nit would perform. We then detonated it to see if it worked.\nIt usually did, but sometimes it didn\u2019t, and we didn\u2019t always\nunderstand why. Basically, we solved the problem of building\nsafety, security, and reliability into a weapon from the top\ndown: if the full device worked, its components must be\nworking. So we froze the design at this point and did our best\nto build systems that exactly replicated what we had tested.\nStockpile stewardship is all about\ndoing nuclear testing on a computer.\nIt\u2019s just damn hard on the computer!\nIn the post-testing era, we realized that without the top-down\napproach, we would have to piece together how nuclear\nweapons function from the bottom up\u2014that is, gather all the\nbasic science pieces underlying the behavior of each of the\nweapons\u2019 different materials and physical processes and then\nuse that information to calculate how the complete nuclear\nweapon would function.\nWe quickly realized the best way to do this was to represent\nall this basic science as a series of mathematical models and\nthen integrate all those models, along with copious amounts\nof data about physical properties, into a huge computer\ncalculation that would accurately predict a weapon\u2019s\nperformance.\nTo be sure the calculation was accurate, we would validate it\nby comparing its results with the data from past U.S. nuclear\ntests [over 1,000 of them] and the data from newly conducted\n\u201cintegrated\u201d experiments. Integrated experiments reproduce\nin the real world some portion of how weapons perform, for\nThe Rocky Flats Plant near Denver, Colorado, opened in 1952 to build plutonium pits for primaries, the triggers for thermonuclear weapons. Rocky Flats made\nthousands of pits per year in a plant with over 300,000 square feet of laboratory space. Pit production was temporarily halted in 1989 and completely\ndiscontinued in 1992.

Thus,\nintegrated tests would put real-world checks and balances on\nour virtual-world calculations of performance.\nThis was the bottom-up approach. It would enable weapons\ndesigners to make technically sound judgments about a\nweapon\u2019s performance without any new nuclear tests. In 1994,\nshortly after its conception, we named this approach \u201csciencebased\nstockpile stewardship,\u201d now the Stockpile Stewardship\nProgram. A colleague of mine, Jas Mercer-Smith, has a good\nline about this. He likes to say, \u201cStockpile stewardship is all\nabout doing nuclear testing in a computer. It\u2019s just damn hard\non the computer!\u201d\nFinding the Fundamental Science Pieces\nWe realized in the early 1990s not only that computer calculations\nof weapon performance were going to take a level of\ncomputing power that didn\u2019t exist at the time but also that the\nbasic science pieces for building those computer calculations\nwere missing as well.\nOne of the missing science pieces was an understanding of\nmany of the properties of weapon materials\u2014for example,\nthe strength and compressibility of many of the materials\nwithin the \u201cphysics package\u201d (the energy-producing part of\nthe weapon, containing explosives and fissile material)\u2014and\nhow those properties changed under extreme pressures,\ntemperatures, forces, and accelerations, especially after the\nmaterials aged.\nIn the nuclear testing era, we\u2019d never thoroughly characterized\nthe properties of the materials that went into the weapons\u2014\nwe hadn\u2019t needed to because the weapons were tested\nand regularly replaced. This limited characterization was no\nmore evident than for the most important material in the\nweapon: plutonium.\nFor example, we didn\u2019t understand the details of how the\nplutonium sphere [the \u201cpit\u201d inside the primary of a nuclear\nweapon] gets compressed when its surface is hit by a strong\nshock wave from high explosives. The pressure from the\nshock wave causes the plutonium not only to implode [move\ninward] but also to get denser because the atoms in the\nplutonium are forced closer together [compressed]. But how\nmuch pressure causes how much compression, that is, how\ngreat an increase in density?\nWe needed to put that quantitative information into our\ncomputer codes so they could accurately predict exactly\nwhen, during implosion, the subcritical pit would reach a\nsupercritical configuration needed to sustain a fission chain\nreaction. But we didn\u2019t have accurate experimental data to\ngive us that quantitative information. Since we didn\u2019t know\nthis, we certainly couldn\u2019t predict how decades of aging might\nchange plutonium\u2019s ability to compress. In fact, we didn\u2019t even\nThe Los Alamos Plutonium Facility opened in 1978 to support nuclear weapons development and testing. After Rocky Flats was shut down in 1992, DOE tasked\nLos Alamos to begin pit manufacturing. The Los Alamos facility was the only one in the nuclear weapons complex that could be modified to do that kind of\nwork. Compared with the 300,000 square feet at Rocky Flats, the Los alamos Plutonium Facility has only about 60,000 square feet of laboratory space in which\nLaboratory personnel can conduct almost all the plutonium science and all the pit production in the United States. (Photo: Los Alamos)\n8 Los Alamos National Laboratory\nknow whether its compressibility, strength, and metallurgical\nstability actually would be affected by aging. So one of the\nfirst things we had to do in stewardship was build the tools\nand facilities needed for measuring these types of material\nproperties in plutonium and in other key weapon materials.\nDuring the implosion of a primary,\na precise sequence of processes\nmust work together perfectly.\nIn 1997 I moved from the group that was charged with\nexamining pits and plutonium, and I asked to start a program\nto study aging in all the materials within the weapon. We\ncalled this work \u201cenhanced surveillance.\u201d Initially, enhanced\nsurveillance was a $7 million program at Los Alamos, but\nwithin a few years, it grew to five times that size. By 1999\nwe had 40 science projects at Los Alamos, and another 100\nprojects at other labs and sites, devoted to learning how the\nvarious materials would age and how that aging would affect\na weapon\u2019s performance. Some of the country\u2019s best chemists,\nengineers, and materials scientists became focused on aging\nnuclear weapons, and the success of their work formed a key\nbasis for the Stockpile Stewardship Program.\nAnother missing science piece was a detailed quantitative\nunderstanding of the other physical processes that go on\nduring a nuclear detonation. (See \u201cNuclear Weapons 101.\u201d)\nThrough experience and nuclear testing, these processes\nhad been partially measured and modeled, but never to\nthe degree that would make us confident that a bottom-up\ncalculation would be predictive, that is, would provide an\naccurate picture of exactly how all the processes fit together\ninto a working whole.\nTo do the basic science experiments needed to improve\nour understanding of these processes and convert that\nunderstanding into mathematical models for high-resolution,\n3D, bottom-up calculations of weapon performance,\nstewardship provided for a number of new research\nprograms. It also provided for new facilities at Los Alamos,\nLawrence Livermore, and Sandia National Laboratories.\nBy the year 2000, DOE had established nearly a dozen\n\u201ccampaigns\u201d to address these science issues. These campaigns\nhave made tremendous progress in filling in the gaps in the\nmyriad physics and materials issues of relevance to weapon\nassessment, and they continue to make advancements\nto this day.\nAccelerated Strategic Computing Initiative\nOne important campaign was about investing in powerful\nnew scientific computing capabilities\u2014advanced, fast\nsupercomputers and new computer codes\u2014to perform the\nbottom-up calculations, which would include all the new fundamental\nscience and data from new experiments. In other\nwords, we would take all the new data on material properties,\ncombine those data with the physics we learned, wrap\nall that into new weapons computer codes millions of lines\nlong and developed over many years and have the codes step\nthrough a detonation piece by piece. The codes would mock\nup the nuclear weapon virtually, first in two dimensions and\nultimately in three, using millions of pixels to model the exact\nshapes of weapon components. And the codes would track\nthe changes in each pixel for many tiny increments of time to\naccurately simulate the detonation.\nIn the mid-1990s, a full-system bottom-up calculation\u2014from\nthe detonation of high explosives to the final energy release\nof the entire warhead\u2014would have had to run for years to\nreach completion at our newly desired levels of detail. We\nneeded to reduce that running time from years to months,\nand we needed to do it as soon as possible because most of the\nweapons designers with testing experience would be retiring\nover the next decade or two. Their real-life testing experiences\nwould be critical to evaluating the accuracy of the computer\nmodels we hoped to generate.\nFor stockpile stewardship, Los Alamos scientists use 3D computer visualizations\n(like the one shown here) to understand the results of weapon\nperformance simulations. (Photo: Los Alamos)\nNational Security Science July 2014\nAt Nevada we built a state-of-the-art\ndynamic testing lab down in a mine.\nWe were running to beat the clock, so Reis, working at DOE,\ncreated ASCI, the Accelerated Strategic Computing Initiative.\nUnder that initiative, DOE and the computer industry began\nproducing, at an accelerated pace, computational platforms\nthat started to break records in terms of their capabilities. For\nexample, we reached 1,000 trillion calculations per second\n(petaflops) in 2008 with the Roadrunner supercomputer,\na milestone that was widely considered impossible in the\n1990s. Another important advance was the move to parallel\nprocessing. Thousands of processors were now used to\ncompute different parts of the same problem simultaneously.\nThese advances increased computational power from millions\nof calculations per second (megaflops) to trillions (teraflops)\nand eventually quadrillions (petaflops) of calculations\nper second. And all this was done to enable the massive\ncalculations that were needed for modeling a nuclear weapon.\nIntegrated-Test Facilities\nBut it wasn\u2019t enough to have the fundamental data in the new\ncodes and to run the new codes on the new supercomputers.\nWe also needed to validate the predictions from the new codes\nas correct, so we brought to bear the third major investment\nfor stewardship, namely, facilities where weapons designers,\nold and new, could do integrated tests that reproduced some\nbut not all aspects of weapon behavior. The real-world results\nfrom those integrated tests would provide a check on what the\ncodes predicted for the same phenomena.\nThe most common integrated test today is, as it was in the\ntesting era, the hydrodynamic test, or \u201chydrotest,\u201d a nonnuclear\ntest in which a replica of a primary undergoes implosion\nand the implosion is imaged by x-rays. These implosion\nexperiments are called hydrodynamic tests because, at the\nhigh pressures attained during implosion, the materials flow\nlike liquids. To keep the hydrotest nonnuclear, a surrogate\nmetal is used in place of plutonium.\nHydrotests at DARHT\nThe most important integrated test facility at Los Alamos is\nDARHT [pronounced \u201cdart\u201d], the Dual-Axis Radiographic\nHydrodynamic Test facility (see p. 41). At DARHT the\nhydrotest of a mock primary occurs inside a sealed steel test\nvessel, and two powerful x-ray machines set at a 90-degree\nangle to each other take simultaneous x-rays of the implosion\nprocess, giving us two views at one instant. One of the\nmachines takes a single image, and the other captures a fourimage\nsequence, thereby making a kind of a short \u201cmovie.\u201d\nDown in a mine called U1a, at the Nevada National Security Site, two members of the Los Alamos staff prepare the front end of Cygnus, a powerful x-ray\nmachine similar to DARHT. Two electron beams traverse the two parallel tubular sections (foreground and center) from right to left, are bent, and produce\nintense x-ray pulses behind the metal wall at the far left. The pulses emerge at a 60-degree angle to each other to record different views of an implosion\nexperiment as in the Gemini experiments (p. 10). (Photo: Los Alamos)\nContinued on p. 11\n9\nLos Alamos National Laboratory\nRevolutionary diagnostics at the U1a plutonium laboratory at the Nevada National\nSecurity Site (NNSS) have the potential to answer difficult questions about the aging of\nplutonium, pit manufacturing, features on a pit\u2019s surface, and certification of reused pits.\nIn that way, it is possible that they will save billions of dollars in pit production costs.\nThose diagnostics were in play during the recent Gemini experiments. Named after the\nconstellation Gemini (the twin brothers Castor and Pollux in Greek mythology), the series\nconsisted of twin hydrotests: scaled-down implosions that test material behavior in a\ncondition similar to that of a weapon primary. The first test, Castor, was designed with a\nsurrogate metal in place of plutonium. Pollux, which used plutonium, is referred to as a\nsubcrit because it did not use enough plutonium to achieve a critical mass. The United\nStates has used the NNSS to execute subcrits as part of stockpile stewardship since 1997.\nThe idea of the Gemini series was to compare the implosion behavior of a surrogate\nwith that of plutonium. The use of surrogate materials is highly desirable\u2014for example,\nthey are less expensive to use, and production is easier. Surrogates are routinely used\nwithin the Weapons Program, but we are still studying the limits of their applicability\nas representatives of plutonium in hydrotests and other experiments. To what extent can\nexperimenting with surrogates tell us how well aged plutonium pits or pits made with\nnew manufacturing processes implode? Do the data obtained from experiments with\nsurrogates contain gaps that affect the data\u2019s usefulness for validating the accuracy of the\nweapons codes? The Gemini experiments could help answer such questions.\nThe two shots were phenomenally successful. \u201cDiagnostic equipment fielded by our\nscientists resulted in more data of this kind collected in this single experiment [Pollux]\nthan in all other previous subcritical experiments,\u201d says NNSA Deputy Administrator for\nDefense Programs Don Cook.\n\u201cIn both Castor and Pollux, the new photon Doppler velocimetry (PDV) diagnostic tool\nused hundreds of laser beams to continuously monitor the velocity of hundreds of points\non the imploding material\u2014all recorded while the material was being driven inward by\nshock waves from high explosives. PDV produces 10,000 times more data than previous\ntechniques. It is like going from the dots and dashes of the Morse code to high-definition\nTV. Simultaneously, Cygnus, a powerful x-ray machine (see photo, p. 9), took x-ray\nsnapshots of the implosion from different angles. Used together, x-rays and PDV have the\npotential to detect effects from aging, processing changes, and features that could impact\nweapon performance.\u201d\nCook continues, \u201cThis type of data is critical for ensuring that our computer simulations\ncan accurately predict performance and thus is critical for continuing our confidence in\nthe safety and effectiveness of the nation\u2019s stockpile.\u201d\nGemini Experiments\nIn PDV the novel fiber-optic probe shown here measures the velocity distribution of the surface of an imploding pit (not shown) by\nusing hundreds of very thin laser beams. When each laser beam reflects off that surface, its frequency shifts in proportion to the surface\nvelocity at that point. Those shifts made by the different beams thus become a continuous time record of the velocity distribution.\n10\nNational Security Science July 2014 11\nDARHT\u2019s images have unprecedented resolution, and we\ncan compare them with our calculations to check whether\nthe calculations simulated the implosion correctly. These\ncapabilities make DARHT a unique experimental facility\nand critical to the stewardship program because having\nintegrated experimental data for direct comparison with\ncomputer simulations is absolutely key to validating our\ncodes and calculations. Lawrence Livermore also developed\nan important integrated-testing tool at the same time\u2014the\nNational Ignition Facility, NIF. While DARHT concentrates\non hydrodynamics in the implosion stage of a primary, NIF\nis used for studies of later elements of weapon function that\nare also important to model and understand. DARHT and\nNIF are used by scientists from each laboratory to gain new\nunderstandings of weapons performance and behavior.\nDARHT is a unique experimental\nfacility and critical to the\nstewardship program.\nNevada National Security Site\nBecause we don\u2019t use plutonium at DARHT, we needed to\nbuild a facility at the Nevada Test Site [now the Nevada\nNational Security Site] where we could do integrated tests\ninvolving plutonium and high explosives. By both executive\nand congressional order, such experiments would have to be\nsubcritical, \u201csubcrits.\u201d These are experiments that dynamically\ncompress plutonium with explosives but must never produce\na critical mass.\nOver 20 years ago at the Nevada site, a shaft and its\nsupporting network of tunnels were dug 963 feet below the\ndesert surface. This complex, called U1a, was built to contain\nan underground nuclear test, but the test never took place.\nOver the last15 years or so, U1a has been expanded and\nmodernized into a highly sophisticated, unique laboratory\nwith advanced diagnostics. Today, U1a is the only place in\nthe nation where high-explosives-driven plutonium testing\ntakes place. Cygnus (see photograph on p. 9), which is akin to\na miniature version of DARHT, is an example of an advanced\ndiagnostic at U1a. Cygnus takes x-ray pictures of plutonium\nas it is explosively imploded.\nRecently, in collaboration with National Security\nTechnologies, we added photon Doppler velocimetry, PDV,\nto our diagnostics. PDV uses hundreds of laser probe beams\n(see photo on opposite page) to provide substantially more\nand better data than previously possible, data that is used to\nbetter understand the dynamic behavior of nuclear materials.\nIn essence, we built a state-of-the-art plutonium-testing\nlaboratory in a mine, a lab that is revolutionizing our ability\nto understand and assess how nuclear weapons function. The\nrecent Gemini experiments (see opposite page), which won\nthe prestigious Secretary of Energy Achievement Award, were\nconducted at U1a.\nProton Radiography\nDARHT\u2019s x-rays let us take a sequence of four images of\nthe implosion of a surrogate weapon primary. Because it\nuses strong x-rays, DARHT is very good at imaging dense\nmaterials like metals. But many of a weapon\u2019s materials (such\nThe proton radiography facility at the Los alamos Neutron Science Center, where a powerful proton beam can take \u201cmovie\u201d images of a shock wave traveling\nthrough high explosives and other weapons materials. (Photo: Los Alamos)\nContinued from p. 9\nLos Alamos National Laboratory\nas explosives, foams, and cushions) aren\u2019t dense; they\u2019re\nrelatively lightweight. When DARHT is tuned to look for the\nmovement of metals, it can\u2019t easily image the movement of\nshocks in things like high explosives. This problem has been\nknown for many years, and some very clever scientists at Los\nAlamos figured out that protons\u2014the nuclei of hydrogen\natoms\u2014would make an excellent probe to image these lighter\nmaterials.\nHence, the science of proton radiography, pRad, was born.\nThe pRad facility, an outgrowth of the Los Alamos Neutron\nScience Center (LANSCE), uses protons to take images of\nmany of the materials in the physics package at high contrast.\nProton radiography is especially well suited to studies of the\nmovement of shock waves inside the explosives themselves.\nVery short pulses of protons, accelerated to over 80 percent\nof the speed of light, can penetrate these materials and\ncreate a sequence of 10 or more 2D \u201cmovie\u201d images of, say, a\ndetonation travelling through high explosives at\n17,000 miles per hour.\nWeapon Autopsies\nAn important element of stewardship is a surveillance\nprogram to monitor the aging of weapons in the stockpile.\nEach year the Navy and Air Force return several weapons of\neach type. Most of these are nondestructively examined and\nreturned to the military. A small number of these weapons\nundergo destructive evaluation. In essence, we perform\nan autopsy on them. The weapon is disassembled into its\ncomponents, and those components are sent back to their\nproduction agencies for evaluation. Pits are returned to Los\nAlamos, where we cut them open for detailed examination.\nPlutonium is extracted and subjected to a variety of tests\nto look for aging or for birth defects [flaws created during\noriginal manufacture]. These measurements are compared\nwith the manufacturing records for that specific unit, and\nchanges are noted that may have resulted from aging.\nCold War weapons were much\nlike Ferraris: complex and\nlightweight, with high performance\nbut little margin for error.\nDuring these surveillance operations, if we find a deviation\nfrom specifications, we report this as a Significant Finding\nNotification, or SFN. The designers evaluate each SFN, and\nif they feel it requires further assessment, they elevate the\nnotification to a Significant Finding Investigation, or SFI.\nFrom 1995 to 2005, the three weapons laboratories opened\nand investigated a total of 156 SFIs. Of these 156 SFIs, 75\nwere determined to be \u201cnonactionable.\u201d In these 75 cases,\nthe investigation and assessment revealed that no impact on\nsafety, security, or performance was anticipated.\nThe remaining 81 SFIs were deemed to be actionable, and\na component or material was changed, often as part of a\nscheduled refurbishment process, or a change was made to\nthe certification of the weapon, usually as a limitation in\nstorage, deployment, or military requirements. Using the\ntools of stewardship and the expert judgment of laboratory\nstaff, these SFIs are being closed. In FY 2013 three SFIs were\nclosed, and to date one SFI has been closed in FY 2014.\nPit Manufacturing\nWhen the Department of Energy closed the Rocky Flats\nPlant, the facility had not completed enough W88 pits to\nsupport destructive surveillance activities. As a consequence,\nit became apparent that the nation needed to restore its ability\nto make more pits. That mission was assigned to Los Alamos\nby then secretary of energy Hazel O\u2019Leary.\nU.S. Air Force missileers prepare a Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile\nfor a test launch at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.\n(Photo: U.S. Air Force)\n12\nNational Security Science July 2014\nThis became the pit rebuild program, active from 1997 to\n2010. In addition to resupplying pits for the Navy\u2019s W88\nwarheads, pit rebuild had three other important goals. One\nwas to capture some of the manufacturing technologies\npreviously used at Rocky Flats and put them to use at\nthe Lab\u2019s Plutonium Facility. The second was to develop\nreplacement technologies for those processes that couldn\u2019t be\nreplicated. The third was to demonstrate that we could certify\nthese newly rebuilt pits, along with certain new production\nmethods, using integrated experiments, simulations, and\nother tools of stewardship.\nRebooting Aged Weapons\nIt is important to understand the design goals and characteristics\nof the Cold War\u2013era stockpile, the stockpile we still\nhave today. Weapons designed during the Cold War placed\na premium on military characteristics designed to deter a\nspecific adversary, the Soviet Union. One of the design goals\nwas to stretch limited plutonium inventories as far as possible\nin order to build the most weapons from the limited supply of\nthis strategic material. We were in an arms race with the Soviet\nUnion, and every gram of plutonium mattered. If you could\nreduce the amount of plutonium in a weapon, you could build\na few more weapons.\nOptimizing yield to weight was\neverything. This didn\u2019t come for free.\nAt the same time, we wanted to optimize the yield-to-weight\nratio in warheads going onto missiles: we wanted the biggest\nyield for the least amount of plutonium and in the smallest\nand lightest warhead package. This allowed the nation to\nplace multiple warheads on a single missile, expanding the\ntarget set and enhancing Cold War deterrence. This was\nespecially true for warheads on strategic missiles, where\nweight was at an absolute premium. Optimizing yield to\nweight was everything in our designs. This didn\u2019t come for\nfree. The price we paid in optimizing lightweight designs\nfor maximum yield was less margin for error and greater\ncomplexity\u2014in some cases we made these warheads very\ncomplicated. The history of Cold War design at the national\nlaboratories is one of exceptional success; we\u2019re very proud of\nthe fact that we did, indeed, build very lightweight, compact,\nand powerful nuclear weapons. These weapons helped end\nthe Cold War.\nBut we also didn\u2019t leave much margin in the performance of\nthese designs. The margin for error was quite low. In these\ndesigns, even something small going wrong can affect the\nweapon\u2019s performance. We often compare weapon designs to\nsports cars. Cold War weapons were much like Ferraris:\ncomplex, high performance, and lightweight, with little margin\nfor error and with costly build and maintenance requirements.\nAnd it took not one nuclear test but in some cases up\nto a dozen to confirm that the highly optimized designs would\nwork under all kinds of environmental and combat conditions.\nWe tweaked these designs between tests to ensure they\nwere operating as we intended, given their tiny margins for\nerror.\nRecall that during the Cold War we designed weapons to stay\nin the stockpile for 10 to maybe 20 years, certainly not 50 or\n70 . . . or 100 years. New production and new designs had\nalways replaced older weapons in the stockpile. But all this\nchanged with the period from 1989 to 1992.\nThe result is that the age of our weapons today requires us\nto eventually refurbish and \u201clife extend\u201d each warhead. This\nrefurbishment is the work of the life-extension programs\n(LEPs). The LEPs are designed to refurbish, modify, update,\nor replace components to ensure that the weapons remain\nsafe, secure, and reliable for an additional 20 to 30 years. The\nLEPs were executed first for the W87 (a Livermore design)\nand then for the W76 (a Los Alamos design). The B61 bomb\n(also a Los Alamos design) LEP is now underway. Eventually,\nall the weapon types may be \u201crebooted\u201d in this fashion.\nTest launch of a Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile at\nVandenberg Air Force Base in California. (Photo: Open Source)\n13\n14 Los Alamos National Laboratory\nThe Silent Sentinels\nSome people say nuclear weapons aren\u2019t that important anymore.\nIn my mind nothing could be further from the truth.\nI recall a story from a few years ago. During a congressional\nhearing, a member of the military was asked, basically, what\nrole nuclear weapons still had. Why did we still need them?\nThe answer was, \u201cNuclear weapons function every day. They\nare our silent sentinels, reminding everyone of this country\u2019s\nultimate means of reprisal . . . . Those that would wish ill to\nthe United States must always calculate, have second thoughts,\nwhen contemplating an act against us.\u201d That\u2019s deterrence.\nAt a deep level, I don\u2019t like the fact that we have to threaten\nretaliation to maintain peace. However, that\u2019s the contradiction\nof deterrence. And from 1945 until today, it hasn\u2019t failed.\nIt still operates. Norris Bradbury [the Laboratory\u2019s second\ndirector] used to call new staff members into his office for a\nshort discussion. He would start by saying, \u201cIf the products of\nour work are ever again used in anger, then we will have failed\nin our mission. We don\u2019t build nuclear weapons to kill people.\nWe build nuclear weapons to buy time for our political leaders\nto find a better way.\u201d Bradbury understood the contradiction\nof nuclear weapons\u2014that we retain these objects of awful\ndestruction in order to preserve the ultimate peace.\nNuclear weapons have a destructive power that current\ngenerations have never witnessed. They\u2019ve never seen a\nnuclear weapon tested; it\u2019s only in the abstract that they can\nappreciate the awful power of these creations. Harold Agnew\n[the Laboratory\u2019s third director] proposed that once in every\ngeneration a nuclear weapon be detonated above ground,\nwith world leaders required to witness it and see for themselves\nits sheer size and power. If each generation of leaders\ndid this, they would surely never use a nuclear weapon.\nA Better Way\nIs there a better way? Can we achieve the benefit of deterrence\nwhile lessening the risks? These questions were a few\nthat I examined during my time at Stanford University. I\ncame to understand that the work of Los Alamos and the\nother weapons laboratories was growing in importance as the\ncountry and the world strove to reduce the sheer numbers\nof nuclear weapons. Indeed, could we find a roadmap to the\nvision Bradbury had of a better way?\nI\u2019ve come to believe that as stewardship has moved forward,\nthere\u2019s been a new kind of payoff. As we become really good\nat understanding how nuclear weapons work and more\nconfident that we can, with agility, reconstitute an arsenal to\nrespond to new threats, that capability itself becomes a growing\npart of the deterrent. This is the future. Several prescient\nLab staff members predicted this many years ago. Ted Gold\nand Rich Wagner, in consultation with John Immele, wrote\na paper in 1990, \u201cLong Shadows and Virtual Swords,\u201d which\nexamined this strategy. The weapons that we designed at\nLos Alamos are not the sole protectors of our security. The\nwork itself\u2014the science and engineering\u2014is also part of the\ndeterrent. Elements of this strategy, a capability-based deterrent,\nhave been adopted as part of the 2010 Nuclear Posture\nReview conducted by the Obama administration.\nWe build nuclear weapons to buy\ntime for our political leaders to\nfind a better way.\nThe most important element of stockpile stewardship and a\ncapability-based deterrent is the people. I\u2019ve been a witness\nto innovations that astound me to this day. The clever ideas,\ndedication, and work ethic of Los Alamos staff are extraordinary.\nThere have been achievements here in support of stewardship\nthat the previous generation couldn\u2019t have imagined.\nMy greatest pride comes from interacting with hundreds of\nexceptional scientists and engineers at the Laboratory. The\nchallenge in capability-based deterrence is ensuring an agile\ncapability. We must be able to respond to world developments\nwith sufficient agility so that no one doubts our ability\nto overwhelm and defeat an adversary.\nIn a very real sense, our deterrent will evolve so that it\u2019s not\njust the products of our work\u2014the nuclear systems we design\nand maintain\u2014but our work itself that will become the protector\nof our security. In this vision, the Laboratory is more\nimportant than it ever was, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re headed.\"\n~Joseph Martz"], [2965, "2017-09-03T02:45:42Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.97, 0.03], " H bomb fake news from DPRK"], [368, "2017-09-03T01:38:47Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [30364, "2017-09-03T01:30:42Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.45, 0.55], ""], [1646, "2017-09-03T01:01:27Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.25], "per @cmeinel "], [28414, "2017-09-02T23:29:31Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.9], ""], [37379, "2017-09-02T22:48:12Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.65, 0.35], "@Dsarin @cdob63 @SneakyPete531 @Censusguyz @JS @fburdine @Anneinak @Amazing-Criswell @Isgold7 @praedico Please help analyze this new data: I am totally puzzled by North Korea's claim just hours ago that they have installed an \"H-Bomb\" on one of their ICBMs.  Full text here:  Kim Jong Un Gives Guidance to Nuclear Weaponization\nDate: 03/09/2017 | Source: KCNA.kp (En)  Pyongyang, September 3 (KCNA) -- Respected Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un guided the work for nuclear weaponization on the spot. He was greeted by senior officials of the Department of Munitions Industry of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) and scientists of the Nuclear Weapons Institute before being briefed on the details of nuclear weaponization. The institute recently succeeded in making a more developed nuke, true to the strategic intention of the WPK for bringing about a signal turn in nuclear weaponization. He watched an H-bomb to be loaded into new ICBM. Saying that he felt the pride of indomitably bolstering up the nuclear forces at a great price while seeing the Juche-oriented thermonuclear weapon with super explosive power made by our own efforts and technology, he expressed great satisfaction over the fact that our scientists do anything without fail if the party is determined to do. He was acquainted himself with technical specifications and structural and operational characters of the H-bomb. The scientists further upgraded its technical performance at a higher ultra-modern level on the basis of precious successes made in the first H-bomb test. The H-bomb, the explosive power of which is adjustable from tens kiloton to hundreds kiloton, is a multi-functional thermonuclear nuke with great destructive power which can be detonated even at high altitudes for super-powerful EMP attack according to strategic goals. All components of the H-bomb were homemade and all the processes ranging from the production of weapons-grade nuclear materials to precision processing of components and their assembling were put on the Juche basis, thus enabling the country to produce powerful nuclear weapons as many as it wants, he said. Noting that the scientists, technicians, workers, soldiers and officials in the atomic power industry, who have made devoted efforts to raising the level of nuclear weaponization up to its perfection as intended by the Party, are creditable \"nuclear combatants\" of the Party who are upholding its line of simultaneously developing the two fronts with the strongest nukes, he highly praised their exploits. Underlining the need for the institute to dynamically conduct the campaign for successfully concluding the final-stage research and development for perfecting the state nuclear force, he set forth tasks to be fulfilled in the research into nukes.\n_________________________ Note that I have worked on this sort of thing in a classified role so I have some understanding of the technological hurdles.

The situation is reminiscent of when we responded to similar reports in mid-June that a nuclear test was imminent at that time.[3] Nonetheless, we remain firm in our previous assessments that the DPRK has, since April 2017, continued to maintain the site at a high state of readiness such that it could conduct a test on short notice, whenever the political decision is made to proceed with another test or tests. It is just that we cannot report that there is any observable evidence on the most recent commercial satellite imagery to show that such a decision has already been made.\nhttp://www.38north.org/2017/08/punggye083017/ ( Bermudez-Liu) 8-30-2017"], [368, "2017-08-31T23:09:46Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2017-08-31T16:20:42Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.44, 0.56], ""], [29266, "2017-08-31T16:16:10Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.9], ""], [12879, "2017-08-31T15:25:03Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.7, 0.3], ""], [34628, "2017-08-31T14:12:27Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.45, 0.55], ""], [1333, "2017-08-31T14:07:26Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.65, 0.35], ""], [67, "2017-08-31T02:37:50Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.4, 0.6], ""], [12302, "2017-08-31T01:15:17Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.25], "I follow @Anneinak on this and raise my forecast. 38 North at least to my knowledge has been spot on in these kind of questions so far.

I agree that the DPRK is not going to nuke anyone. I wish some of the press coverage of the whole issue were more nuanced and instructive. Comparison class is idiocy (technical term) that lead the US into Iraq the second time. 2. I believe that anyone who needs to consider what tools the DPRK has in their arsenal against the aggressors has already planned for a possible nuclear incident if things spiral out of control. This includes non-missile delivered surprises. 3. Following the #2 premise, I've decided that the DPRK probably does NOT need to test to make any more political statements. (This assumes a degree of rationality and control which I believe is correct even in spite of some ill-sourced factoids to the contrary.) 4. I am not convinced that the DPRK is satisfied with what nuclear testing they've done. If I were KJU (who has studied physics) I'd prefer at least two militarily useful nuclear packages. Probably at least one boosted and perhaps smaller in yield than some expect. What they have now may suffice in the interim, but won't be good enough for their long-term deterrence. If correct, what does one do? Testing on the Korean peninsula is out. (Except for the issue of security which is non-trivial,) Getting something interesting into a far-away place like the Indian Ocean wouldn't need first world resources or cloak and dagger capabilities.

Bermudez Jr. Recent commercial satellite imagery reveals several developments suggesting that North Korea may be accelerating the development of the sea-based leg of its nuclear forces. Of particular interest in the imagery is that netting or tarps have been suspended above both the fore and aft decks of the SINPO-class submarine obscuring any activity taking place beneath them. This was last done prior to the July 9, 2016 test of the Pukguksong-1, suggesting that the North may be preparing for a new series of \u201cat sea\u201d test launches, has undertaken modifications or upgrades to the submarine\u2019s launch systems, or is developing a more advanced version of the Pukguksong-1. Recent ejection tests of an SLBM also support the assessment that an at-sea SLBM test may be forthcoming. Additionally, imagery of the Mayang-do Navy Shipyard and Submarine Base shows the same number of ROMEO-class submarines that are usually berthed there, indicating that a recent spike in ROMEO activity in the East Sea (Sea of Japan) was a singular rather than force-wide event.\n-- http://www.38north.org/2017/08/sinpo081117/ From CHAMPS KNOW checklist: \nHunt for info.

However, a number of critical questions remain about how soon Pyongyang could field a reliable weapon, not the least of which is whether or not North Korea can shield a nuclear warhead from the rigors of re-entry into the earth's atmosphere at ICBM velocities. Video of the Hwasong-14 test has emerged that casts doubt on the North's ability to do so. The Japanese television station, NHK, has a weather camera mounted on the roof of its Hokkaido Prefecture affiliate, located in Muroran City. The camera looks east, across a bay, and in the direction where the Hwasong-14's re-entry vehicle (RV) crashed into the sea, about 200 km from Japan. Based on the camera's position, and the RV's impact point, the camera's view is obscured by the small mountain range located across the bay and the earth's curvature when the RV is about 2 km above the ocean's surface. Given the range, peak altitude and time of flight of the Hwasong-14 test, the RV is traveling at just over 6 km per second when it enters the atmosphere. At about 25 to 30 km altitude, the air is dense enough to slow and heat the RV. At about 20 km above sea level, the RV has become so hot that it begins to glow as its descent is recorded by the camera. It continues to slow and its temperature further rises as it approaches impact with the sea. In the video, peak radiance--when the clouds reflect the RVs radiance resulting in a bright flash--occurs when it is at 6 to 8 km altitude, and a fraction of a second before it passes through or behind a layer of clouds. Soon after the flash, the RV descends to roughly 4 or 5 km altitude, where the frictional forces that slow and heat the RV reach a maximum. At this point, the RV appears to be shedding small radiant objects and is trailed by an incandescent vapor. At an altitude of 3 to 4 km, the RV then dims and quickly disappears. This occurs before the RV passes behind the mountain range and is obscured from the camera's view, indicating that it disintegrated about the time it experienced maximum stressing loads. Had the RV survived the rigors of re-entry, it would have continued to glow until disappearing behind the mountains. In short, a reasonable conclusion based on the video evidence is that the Hwasong-14's re-entry vehicle did not survive during its second test. If this assessment accurately reflects reality, North Korea's engineers have yet to master re-entry technologies and more work remains before Kim Jong Un has an ICBM capable of striking the American mainland.\"\nSo Mr. Morrell is correct \nDPRK needs 2 more things to bake the cake and deliver under one hypothesis\ntests soon!  no deterrence- no sanctions will work DPRK trade up 40% www.bbc.com in 2017\nno diplomacy either-China will do nothing and DPRK  night lights via satellite show DPRK is gaining energy from PRC Power plants over Yalu www.bbc.com Morrell\n\"this  (7-4) is the first North Korean missile test of any kind that demonstrated the capability of reaching the homeland -- possibly as far east as Chicago.

They still have not demonstrated the other two things -- the ability to make a nuclear warhead small enough to fit on a missile and the ability of the warhead and the missile to actually work together as designed, particularly under the stress, pressure, and heat of the launch of the missile and the reentry of the warhead.  end Morrell\nbegin lsgold7\nThat means he will test soon unless North already has the  capabilities\nbegin Morell\n\"It is very important to note that just because the North has not demonstrated these last two capabilities does not mean that they don't have them.

If we slightly scale back South Korea-U.S. military drills and do not forward deploy U.S. strategic weapons, tensions will be eased and then we can assume that North Korea will not carry out provocations.\"\nhttp://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/northkorea/2017/06/22/0401000000AEN20170622010900315.html Check out this timeline just over last 30 hours  S.

Moon Chung-in, a foreign affairs scholar and special presidential adviser, made the remark during a Wilson Center seminar in Washington, saying President Moon has proposed the idea as part of an incremental solution to the nuclear standoff beginning with a freeze of the weapons programs. \"He proposed two things. One, if North Korea suspends its nuclear and missile activities, then we may consult with the United States to (on) scaling down ROK-US joint exercises and training.

The adviser later told reporters that U.S. strategic assets, such as aircraft carriers and nuclear-powered submarines, began participating in joint exercises only since several years ago, and scaling back their participation could help reduce tensions with the North. Chances are low for the North to accept the proposal, but it's still worth a try, he said. \"What's important is to reduce tensions,\" he said.\" and Moon is hedging his bets wisely http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2017/06/17/0301000000AEN20170617001400315.html\n\"SEOUL, June 17 (Yonhap) -- South Korea will soon begin the mass-production of its new mid-range hit-to-kill missile interceptor, code-named M-SAM, as it has passed an operational capability test, a defense official said Saturday.

When tensions rise between Pyongyang and Washington, China will likely continue calling for restraint and the need for dialogue. If China picks a side in these scenarios, it may close diplomatic doors that would be hard to reopen. North Korea can continue to advance its weapons programs and escalate its rhetoric against Beijing, but is unlikely to provoke the degree of response from China that the U.S. would find adequate. Beijing will not pressure North Korea into negotiations until it decides the time is right for negotiations, a process that is beyond the United States\u2019 control.

Pyongyang has recently launched different types of missiles, including a new intermediate-range ballistic missile and a surface-to-air missile. The provocations are expected to dampen Moon's dual-track approach of denuclearizing North Korea while seeking inter-Korean dialogue. He hosted his first National Security Council meeting Thursday, warning that Seoul will never back down in the face of the North's provocations. The latest test came about a week after the U.N. Security Council adopted a fresh sanctions resolution over its missiles. The North is banned from testing ballistic missiles under a set of U.N. sanctions. North Korea is developing nuclear and missile programs at an alarming pace with its stated goal of launching a nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of hitting the U.S. mainland\"\nand\n\" North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has observed the test-firing of a new surface-to-ship cruise missile, Pyongyang's state media said Friday, as the country is seeking to diversify its nuclear weapons and missiles. The country conducted the first test of the missile, which was unveiled at a military parade in April to mark the 105th birthday of late state founder Kim Il-sung, according to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). On Thursday, the North fired what appeared to be short-range anti-ship cruise missiles from its east coast in the latest series of missile tests in defiance of international sanctions, according to the South Korean military. They flew some 200 kilometers. The missile, whose capacity has been improved compared with the existing weaponry system, is a powerful weapon capable of hitting the enemy's ships from the ground, the KCNA said. It was developed by the Academy of National Defense Science, a blacklisted agency by the United Nations over its role in supporting North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.\nhttp://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/northkorea/2017/06/08/0401000000AEN20170608007451315.html\n@anneinak on 105 birthday of KIM I"], [14777, "2017-06-09T13:56:24Z", [0.0, 0.06, 0.34, 0.6], ""], [29145, "2017-06-09T08:59:22Z", [0.0, 0.2, 0.45, 0.35], ""], [2965, "2017-06-09T03:21:43Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.33, 0.66], ""], [1333, "2017-06-08T22:11:01Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.65, 0.35], ""], [368, "2017-06-08T18:59:55Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [32294, "2017-06-08T18:45:00Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.33, 0.67], ""], [4634, "2017-06-08T13:59:59Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6], ""], [691, "2017-06-08T12:19:53Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.73, 0.27], ""], [35957, "2017-06-07T22:31:29Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.75, 0.2], ""], [368, "2017-06-07T19:36:36Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [27101, "2017-06-07T17:19:21Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.35, 0.6], "update for passing of time"], [2965, "2017-06-07T16:30:13Z", [0.0, 0.07, 0.83, 0.1], ""], [241, "2017-06-07T13:54:08Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.33, 0.66], ""], [30364, "2017-06-07T12:45:16Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5], ""], [16652, "2017-06-07T08:48:06Z", [0.0, 0.4, 0.55, 0.05], ""], [31756, "2017-06-06T22:34:03Z", [0.0, 0.03, 0.25, 0.72], ""], [35060, "2017-06-06T20:50:40Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.7, 0.15], ""], [28091, "2017-06-06T18:51:11Z", [0.0, 0.2, 0.8, 0.0], ""], [368, "2017-06-06T18:37:58Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [22833, "2017-06-06T15:05:37Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.45, 0.55], ""], [14777, "2017-06-06T14:46:37Z", [0.0, 0.09, 0.32, 0.59], ""], [691, "2017-06-06T14:38:06Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.74, 0.26], ""], [31238, "2017-06-06T13:40:15Z", [0.0, 0.25, 0.3, 0.45], ""], [15621, "2017-06-06T09:57:51Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.45, 0.45], "Passage of time."], [2965, "2017-06-06T06:04:44Z", [0.0, 0.09, 0.81, 0.1], "pp.yonhapnews.co.kr/YNA/Basic/ForeignGallery/view.aspx?lang=EN&contents_id=PYH20170605167100320'\nKim III spent day watching air defense display\nde cap attack and carriers must have him thinking\ncomposite photo  for distribution in ROK only\"These composite photos carried by North Korea's daily Rodong Sinmun on June 5, 2017, shows the country's top leader Kim Jong-un and performances that he observed at the combat flight contest by the country's air force a day before.

Graham\n02 June 2017 Chicago Skyline SilhouetteAnalysts like Jack Liu and Jeffrey Lewis are to be commended for their interest in educating the public about North Korea\u2019s missile and nuclear programs and endeavoring to provide their readers with \u201cinformed analysis.\u201d However, in a series of recent articles, both analysts have written off the possibility of a nuclear electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack from North Korea as \u201cunlikely\u201d and \u201cscience fiction\u201d because they believe the 10 to 20 kiloton nuclear weapons currently possessed by North Korea are incapable of making an effective EMP attack. This dismisses the consensus view of EMP experts who have advanced degrees in physics and electrical engineering along with several decades of experience in the field\u2014with access to classified data throughout that time\u2014and who have conducted EMP tests on a wide variety of electronic systems, beginning in 1963. By way of background, the Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from Electromagnetic Pulse Attack was established by Congress in 2001 to advise the Congress, the President, the Department of Defense and other departments and agencies of the US Government on the nuclear EMP threat to military systems and civilian critical infrastructures. The EMP Commission was re-established in 2015 with its charter broadened to include natural EMP from solar storms, all manmade EMP threats, cyber-attack, sabotage and Combined-Arms Cyber Warfare. The EMP Commission charter gives it access to all relevant classified and unclassified data and the power to levy analysis upon the Department of Defense. In the interest of better informing 38 North readers about the EMP threat, we offer this commentary to correct errors of fact, analysis, and myths about EMP. Primitive and \u201cSuper-EMP\u201d Nuclear Weapons are Both EMP Threats The EMP Commission finds that even primitive, low-yield nuclear weapons are such a significant EMP threat that rogue states, like North Korea, or terrorists may well prefer using a nuclear weapon for EMP attack instead of destroying a city.[1] In its 2004 report, the Commission cautioned: \u201cCertain types of relatively low-yield nuclear weapons can be employed to generate potentially catastrophic EMP effects over wide geographic areas, and designs for variants of such weapons may have been illicitly trafficked for a quarter-century.\u201d In 2004, two Russian generals, both EMP experts, warned the EMP Commission that the design for Russia\u2019s super-EMP warhead, capable of generating high intensity EMP fields of 200,000 volts per meter, was \u201caccidentally\u201d transferred to North Korea, and that due to \u201cbrain drain,\u201d Russian scientists were in North Korea, helping with their missile and nuclear weapon programs. South Korean military intelligence told their press that Russian scientists are in North Korea helping develop an EMP nuclear weapon. In 2013, a Chinese military commentator stated North Korea has super-EMP nuclear weapons.[2] Super-EMP weapons are low-yield and designed to produce not a big kinetic explosion, but rather a high level of gamma rays, which generate the high-frequency E1 EMP that is most damaging to the broadest range of electronics. North Korean nuclear tests\u2014including the first in 2006, which was predicted to the EMP Commission two years in advance by the two Russian EMP experts\u2014mostly have yields consistent with the size of a super-EMP weapon. The Russian generals\u2019 accurate prediction of when the North would perform its first nuclear test, and the yield being consistent with a super-EMP weapon, indicates their warning about a North Korean super-EMP weapon should be taken very seriously. EMP Threat from Satellites While most analysts are fixated on when in the future North Korea will develop highly reliable intercontinental ballistic missiles, guidance systems, and reentry vehicles capable of striking a US city, the present threat from EMP is largely ignored. An EMP attack does not require an accurate guidance system because the area of effect, having a radius of hundreds or thousands of kilometers, is so large. No reentry vehicle is needed because the warhead is detonated at high-altitude, above the atmosphere. Missile reliability matters little because only one missile has to work to make an EMP attack. For instance, North Korea could make an EMP attack against the United States by launching a short-range missile off a freighter or submarine or by lofting a warhead to 30 kilometers burst height by balloon. While such lower-altitude EMP attacks would not cover the whole US mainland, as would an attack at higher-altitude (300 kilometers), even a balloon-lofted warhead detonated at 30 kilometers altitude could blackout the Eastern Grid that supports most of the population and generates 75 percent of US electricity. Moreover, an EMP attack could be made by a North Korean satellite. The design of an EMP or even a super-EMP weapon could be relatively small and lightweight, resembling the US W-79 Enhanced Radiation Warhead nuclear artillery shell of the 1980s, designed in the 1950s. Such a device could fit inside North Korea\u2019s Kwangmyongsong-3 (KMS-3) and Kwangmyongsong-4 (KMS-4) satellites that presently orbit the Earth. The south polar trajectory of KMS-3 and KMS-4 evades US Ballistic Missile Early Warning Radars and National Missile Defenses, resembling a Russian secret weapon developed during the Cold War, called the Fractional Orbital Bombardment System (FOBS) that would have used a nuclear-armed satellite to make a surprise EMP attack on the United States.[3]\"\nWilliam Graham 38 north.org \nfootnotes:\n[1] John S.

North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs are central to a strategy meant to stave off a threat greater than any foreign adversary: the undermining of the North Korean system. \u201cFor much of the Cold War, North and South Korea were at roughly comparable levels of economic and political development.. . .  But by the 1990s, the South enjoyed a booming economy and a blossoming democracy. . . . Kim Jong-il, then the leader, responded with the \u201cSongun,\u201d or military-first, policy, which marshaled the nation to prepare for a war said to be just around the corner. This policy sought to explain the country\u2019s shortages and rationing as necessary to maintain its immense military, to justify oppression as necessary to root out internal enemies and to rally the nationalism that often comes during wartime. \u201c. . . \u201cIt is the regime\u2019s awareness of a pending legitimacy crisis, not a fear of attack from without, which makes it behave ever more provocatively on the world stage.\u201d \u201cToday, the country and government appear to be stable. But this came at a cost: a permanent state of near-war to stave off the forces of history that would otherwise tear down North Korea.  \u201cA Perpetual State of Almost-War . . . .The Korean War [was] never officially resolved . . .  When Soviet protection fell away, North Korea became suddenly vulnerable against the vastly more powerful United States and its allies. Mr. Kim, unable to seek peace without risking a German-style reunification that would subsume the North under South Korean rule, sought to make any potential war too costly to consider.\n. . . \n\u201cAt first, analysts believe, weapons programs were intended to one day be traded away in a grand bargain with the United States.  But each round of provocation, in deliberately raising the risk of war, made the missile and nuclear programs not just symbolically useful but also strategically necessary. \u201cAfter imposing such threats on its neighbors, North Korea could hardly drop these programs without understandably fearing an attack. Disarmament, in this view, would invite annihilation.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  Conducting nuclear tests contributes to the existential threat narrative that the leadership of DPRK has promulgated for decades."], [241, "2017-05-12T19:49:18Z", [0.0, 0.2, 0.25, 0.55], ""], [35491, "2017-05-12T18:54:23Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [368, "2017-05-12T18:19:51Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [1708, "2017-05-12T15:01:14Z", [0.0, 0.5, 0.45, 0.05], ""], [35033, "2017-05-12T13:53:01Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [2965, "2017-05-12T13:47:13Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], "@dowser   rationale and mine\nTrump been wounded lost a lot of leverage vis a vis Putin, KIm III and Xi Ping \nhe is like a \" dead man walking\"\nSee https://www.wsj.com/articles/amid-uproar-over-comey-firing-sean-spicer-fulfills-military-duties-1494540119\nNice time to be patriotic\n when the rats flee the ships\ntrouble ahead for Trump"], [35377, "2017-05-12T10:20:53Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [11800, "2017-05-12T07:16:41Z", [0.0, 0.6, 0.3, 0.1], "When information doesn't flow freely, prediction becomes a gamble.

In recent years, North Korea has shelled South Korean islands and sunk a Naval corvette, claiming dozens of lives, including civilians. To fund its weapons program, the regime produces narcotics, fake currency and uses cybercrime across the globe.\nHowever, the broader point is that North Korea, for all its many and egregious faults, is a state hell-bent on survival. It might have nuclear weapons, but the regime cannot use them without guaranteeing its own destruction. That\u2019s how nuclear deterrents work.\n\u201cWhy are people panicking about North Korea?\u201d asks Daniel Pinkston, an East Asia expert at South Korea's Troy University. \u201cIt\u2019s secular, they want to survive and they are very cognizant of power balances. They are not suicidal.\u201d\nUnfortunately, there is little chance the regime will voluntarily give up its nuclear weapons. Kim Jong Un is very aware of the fates of Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi and Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, who were both toppled after abandoning their nuclear aspirations. He believes a nuclear bomb guarantees the security of his regime. And he might be right.\nNorth Korea already is a nuclear power. Its first nuclear test was over a decade ago, and analysts say it probably has enough material for a dozen bombs today.\nFrom the Soviet Union and China to India and Pakistan, each new member of the nuclear club has faced a frosty reception. There are few good reasons to welcome North Korea, not least the effect it would have on nuclear proliferation, most notable for Iran. But there are absolutely no good reasons to start another Korean War.\nhttp://time.com/4759066/north-korea-kim-jong-un-donald-trump-nuclear-weapons/ Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that the crisis over North Korea\u2019s nuclear program is deepening after the issue dominated talks with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Moscow.\nHe and Abe believe the situation on the Korean peninsula has \u201cseriously deteriorated,\u201d Putin said Thursday after the Kremlin meeting. \u201cWe call on all states involved in the region\u2019s affairs to refrain from military rhetoric and seek peaceful, constructive dialogue.\u201d A Freeze, to What End?\nThe strategy emerging from Mr. Trump\u2019s national security team comes down to this: Apply overwhelming pressure on the North, both military and economic, to freeze its testing and reduce its stockpile. Then use that opening to negotiate, with the ultimate goal of getting the North Koreans to give up all their weapons.\nMany experts, however, believe that is a fantasy, because Mr. Kim regards even a small arsenal as critical to his survival. The upside of the strategy, if it works, is that the \u201cnuclear freeze\u201d would delay for years the day the North can fit a small, reliable, well-tested weapon atop a large, reliable, well-tested missile. The downside is that it would leave the North Koreans with a small, potent arsenal \u2014 one the United States would be essentially acknowledging, if not accepting. That is why it will be hard for Mr. Trump to fulfill his vow to \u201csolve this problem.\u201d And every day, there is the chance of miscalculation, or an accident.\nAt any moment, Dr. Hecker said on a call to reporters organized by the Union of Concerned Scientists, a live weapon could turn into an accidental nuclear detonation or some other catastrophe.\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/24/world/asia/north-korea-nuclear-missile-program.html?_r=0 No activity of significance is noted at the West Portal, South Portal, Command Center Area or elsewhere in the facility.\nIt is unclear if the noted activity represents a \u201ctactical pause\u201d before a forthcoming nuclear test, a broader more prolonged \u201cstand down\u201d from testing or normal facility operations. Regardless, satellite imagery continues to indicate that the Punggye-ri nuclear test site appears able to conduct a sixth nuclear test at any time once the order is received from Pyongyang.\nhttp://38north.org\n_____________________________________\nCOMMMENTS:  This is a telling moment for both Kim Jun UN and Trump; Both need to prove their bombastic boastings to show the world. On one hand NK can do another show off test anytime, but at the same time they want to survive and they must be aware of how much they can push the envelope.\nOn the other we have Trump who is absolutely unexperienced in these matters [and almost everything else in the position he holds], he also is in the need of a show off and he may even not know how far he can push his envelope.\nIn this power show off the real minds behind are Putin, Abe, and Xi Jinping [not necessarily in that order] and they all prefer the status quo.

Pence used recent U.S. strikes in Syria and Afghanistan as examples to hold up to the North Korean regime, adding the Hermit Kingdom to the list of countries the Trump administration has threatened with military action. \u201cJust in the past two weeks, the world witnessed the strength and resolve of our new president in actions taken in Syria and Afghanistan,\" Pence said in a joint appearance with South Korean acting president Hwang Kyo-ahn. \"North Korea would do well not to test his resolve or the strength of the armed forces of the United States in this region,\" Pence said. Within the past two weeks, the U.S. Navy hit a Syrian air base with 59 Tomahawk missiles after the regime launched a chemical weapons attack on civilians, and dropped the largest non-nuclear device ever unleashed in combat on a warren of tunnels and caves used by Islamic State in Afghanistan. The Vice President\u2019s words are the Trump administration\u2019s harshest to date concerning the North, which is expected to conduct its sixth nuclear test in the upcoming days. He is following in the footsteps of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who recently said \u201caction\u201d must be taken to stop the North\u2019s nuclear program, and the president himself, who promised to \u201ctake care of\u201d the problem with or without China\u2019s help. McMaster joins in. While the Pentagon has generally shied away from warlike rhetorical flourishes, National Security Adviser Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster said Sunday that President Trump would not shy away from moving against North Korea, but \u201cwe do not want to telegraph in any way how we'll respond.\u201d \u201cWhat you saw last week with the president\u2019s decisive response to the Assad regime,\u201d McMaster continued, is \u201cthis national security team is capable of rapidly responding to those sorts of crises or incidents and events and providing the president with options. And our president is clearly comfortable making tough decisions and respond.\u201d The general did add a note of caution however, saying \u201cit\u2019s time for us to undertake all actions we can, short of a military option, to try to resolve this peacefully.\u201d Bulls on parade. On Friday, the North Korean regime flexed some muscle during an annual \u201cDay of the Sun\u201d military parade, where new platforms were rolled out for the first time. Analyst Jeffrey Lewis Tweeted out a great rundown of what we saw, while CNN dove deeper in what was there, and what wasn\u2019t. Nukes. But the impending nuclear test hangs over everything. Over the past five tests, North Korea has increased the explosive yield of its nuclear warheads, but just as important, it is using the tests \u201cto try out different modifications or warhead designs, such as producing lighter warheads that could fit on the tip of missile or using tritium gas to create a more powerful bomb through boosted fission,\u201d Kelsey Davenport, Director for Nonproliferation Policy at the Arms Control Association, told SitRep.  \u201cWe should also assume that North Korea can build a warhead small enough to fit on short or medium range ballistic missiles,\u201d Davenport continued. Robert Litwak of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars told the New York Times that the growing crisis with North Korea is like \u201cthe Cuban missile crisis in slow motion.\u201d \n"], [691, "2017-04-17T11:41:02Z", [0.0, 0.71, 0.29, 0.0], ""], [20156, "2017-04-17T05:55:38Z", [0.0, 0.6, 0.35, 0.05], ""], [1262, "2017-04-17T00:32:26Z", [0.0, 0.99, 0.01, 0.0], "Although the date considered the highest likelihood (4/15) has passed with only a missile failure, the expected nuke test has not yet occurred.

I'm quite hopeful, it's not, because last February (Oscars 2016, 2017) and last year (Brexit, FARC, Trump etc.) I've seen many of us being very \"sticky\" and slow to adjust to new information, including myself.

The report adds to concern that the North may be preparing to conduct what would be its sixth nuclear test. Last week, 38 North, a website specializing on North Korea analysis, also reported that commercial satellite imagery shows tunnel excavation work is continuing at the North's Punggye-ri nuclear test site in a suspected effort to prepare for a new nuclear explosion. It also said the site is capable of handling a new test on short notice. CNN said that U.S. satellites have watched the site for several weeks and seen fresh signs of digging and activity at tunnel entrances. No further details were given\" Tillerson has left Beijing calling for more sanctions  and PRC calling for more diplomacy.\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/us-tillerson-asia-china-idUSKBN16O2V9 \"The United States and China will work together to get nuclear-armed North Korea take \"a different course\", U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Saturday, softening previous criticism of Beijing after talks with his Chinese counterpart. China has been irritated at being repeatedly told by Washington to rein in North Korea's surging nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, one of a series of hurdles in ties between the world's two largest economies. But Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi described the talks with Tillerson as \"candid, pragmatic and productive\". The two sides appeared to have made some progress or put aside differences on difficult issues, at least in advance of a planned summit between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump.

Supporting negotiations with North Korea without preconditions would take a measure of strength and toughness going well beyond what is required to post a late-night tweet. Does Trump have what it takes to take the heat for agreeing that the United States should sit down with North Korea with no preconditions? Is he tough enough to take the pressure while negotiations are hammered out? Is he strong enough to consider incremental steps that could reduce nuclear dangers, then build support for those steps with our allies, Congress and the American people? Is he secure enough to risk negotiations failing\u2014as the odds for success are certainly not great? Is he tough enough to level now with the American people about the real risks of military action against North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile program and explain the consequences? We may know the answers to these questions quickly. North Korea\u2019s most recent test of a ballistic missile this month suggests they have begun probing the new American administration. North Korea may accelerate this process quickly, responding to US and South Korean military exercises beginning in March. That gives Trump and his national security team precious little time to formulate an approach to negotiations, let alone a strategy, for engaging Pyongyang. And time, as they say, may not be on our side. Particularly troubling is the dearth of senior officials and expertise in the relevant departments and agencies for the new president to draw upon. The White House National Security Council (NSC) staff is a mess. Even after the appointment of the highly respected Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster as the new National Security Advisor to replace the departed General Michael Flynn, the NSC may lack relevance if it is not given its historic mandate by the president to effectively coordinate foreign and national security policy across departments and agencies\u2014which will be critical in formulating and executing a new strategy with North Korea that may require years to implement and the involvement of several agencies. Key to the NSC\u2019s ability to do this will be the perception across the government that it knows the president\u2019s mind, and speaks for the president. This is not easy with Trump, to say the least. Rex Tillerson, our new Secretary of State and possibly the president\u2019s designee for conducting diplomacy with the North, is now the only Trump appointee in the Department. If he and the president have agreed on who they want to staff the upper echelons of Foggy Bottom and support him in these negotiations, it remains a mystery to outside observers. That said, what is known is that once nominated, it could still take months for the Trump/Tillerson team at State to be confirmed. The situation in the Pentagon is similar, with Secretary of Defense James Mattis still assembling\u2014and clearing with the White House\u2014his senior policy team. None of this bodes well for quick, agile, or thoughtful approaches to the issues surrounding North Korea. One thing is certain: we are past the point of hoping to muddle through, waiting for sanctions alone to do the trick or for the North Korean regime to collapse or transform itself in ways that solve this problem for us. In the absence of a new diplomatic initiative, the already dangerous situation on the Korean peninsula and the threat posed to America, will get worse. Leaders in Seoul\u2014now gripped by political turmoil that has the country on edge\u2014and Tokyo will get more nervous. The complications in the relationship between China and the United States will get more serious. And Kim Jong Un will get more reckless\" that is why I am at 75%. provocations are the pattern of a paranoid regime as are the assasination of potential heirs\" and Check out this piece.\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/north-korea-mocks-china-for-dancing-to-u-s-tune-1487852124\n\"North Korea appeared to lash out at Beijing in a state-media commentary published Thursday, aiming unusually pointed rhetoric at a powerful neighbor that Pyongyang has long relied on for economic and diplomatic support. The commentary, published by the state-controlled Korean Central News Agency, didn\u2019t name China but left little doubt about its target: \u201ca neighboring country, which often claims itself to be a \u2018friendly neighbor\u2019.\u201d The article lambasted China for playing down North Korea\u2019s nuclear capabilities and for curbing foreign trade\u2014an apparent reference to China\u2019s weekend announcement that it would suspend coal imports from North Korea for the rest of the year.\" \"While an early round of U.N. sanctions restricted coal imports from North Korea, China is widely believed to have used a so-called humanitarian exception to exceed that cap. That loophole was tightened in November\u2019s U.N. resolution, and North Korea\u2019s protest suggests that Beijing has made clear it intends to adhere to the new rule, said Adam Cathcart, a scholar who focuses on China-North Korea relations at the University of Leeds in the U.K. \u201cI would take this editorial as hard evidence that China has told North Korea it is narrowing the definition of coal exports for \u2018humanitarian purposes,\u2019\u201d Mr. Cathcart said, adding that it was rare for North Korea to criticize China so directly. Mr. Cathcart called the KCNA editorial \u201ca frontal assault,\u201d a shift from the oblique critiques of China that North Korea usually turns to when it expresses its displeasure. In Thursday\u2019s piece, North Korea even adopted a mocking tone, saying that the country is \u201cstyling itself a big power, is dancing to the tune of the U.S.\u201d The KCNA statement also vowed that cutting its exports wouldn\u2019t deter North Korea from developing its nuclear arsenal. \u201cIt is utterly childish to think that the DPRK would not manufacture nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic rockets if a few penny of money is cut off,\u201d it said, using the acronym for its formal name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. China\u2019s Foreign Ministry didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Most experts agree that North Korea's latest nuclear test in September 2016 will not be the last. And although no one can predict when the next test is coming, the rumor mill is heating up. Right now there are many factors coming together indicating that the isolated country could soon make the ground rumble by setting off a new device. \"North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un celebrates his birthday on January 8, and there previously have been two nuclear tests corresponding with birthdays in North Korea's ruling family.  . . . \"Experts are also looking with concern at the inauguration of US President-elect Donald Trump on January 20. This could present a welcome opportunity for Kim to demonstrate strength with an act of provocation. \nKim's New Year's  speech broadcast on state television also lent credibility to this speculation. . . .  \"Along with North Korea experts, the press, especially in South Korea, is currently preoccupied with speculation over the intentions of its neighbor.  . . .  North Korea could take advantage of the political chaos in the South to carry out further provocations. In the current political climate, this would present a volatile situation for the South. . . . The current provisional government is in no condition to deal with this kind of situation.\"\n. . . \n\"Amidst speculation and strategic forecasting, maintaining a cautious tone is also advised in South Korea. . . .  \"Sungtae Park, an international security specialist at the US Council on Foreign Relations, recently wrote in \"The Diplomat\" that the strategy of the new US administration will play a decisive role for North Korea.  . . .  the most important factor is the place North Korea takes on the Trump Administration's list of priorities. If North Korea outranks other foreign policy objectives, and if Trump is willing to use sanctions and even military force against North Korea, according to Park, there is still the problem of diplomacy. \"Is the US ready to send a top negotiator to North Korea who would meet for talks with Kim Jong Un without preconditions?\" he said, adding that this would be the only way to create new space for diplomacy. \"North Korea expert R\u00fcdiger Frank, professor of East Asian Studies at the University of Vienna told DW after the last nuclear test in September 2016 that an entirely new approach was necessary. He said that the  attempts of the international community to prevent North Korea from developing further nuclear weapons were a \"colossal failure.\" \"We saw how sanctions were tightened again and again, both diplomatically and economically,\" said Frank. \"In March 2016, the severest sanctions so far were applied, which affected nearly every sector of North Korea's foreign commerce. And still, the North Koreans continued.\"\nFrom this perspective, one could conclude that the entire strategy since the first nuclear test in 2006 has been wrong. \"If we continue like this, we shouldn't wonder when there is a sixth, seventh and eighth test,\" said Frank. \"No one can say right now if a sixth North Korean nuclear test is imminent or if they will take advantage of political transformations in the US and South Korea to fire missiles. \n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  I keep a watch on 38North's website which analyzes satellite photos.

This claim is wholly unsubstantiated, and almost certainly not true \u2013 particularly where Europe is concerned. The \u201cUS homeland\u201d might generously be interpreted to include the island of Guam. At 3,500 km from North Korean launch sites, it could be just within range of North Korea\u2019s Musudan missile. And the Musudan barely works, exploding in seven out of eight tests so far. But by a generous interpretation, North Korean missiles could possibly reach sovereign US territory that is home to some 125,000 US citizens. Not Hawaii or Alaska, and not the US mainland; one territory in the North Pacific. Europe, by any standard, is completely out of reach. Even the Ural Mountains, traditionally Europe\u2019s eastern border, are some 5,000 km from North Korea. And really, when the ROK talks about \u201cEurope\u201d being within reach, they don\u2019t mean nuking Perm or Chelyabinsk, they mean NATO. NATO\u2019s borders start at 7,000 km from North Korean launch sites, twice the distance North Korean existing missiles can reach. Seoul may be referring to the threat posed by North Korea\u2019s KN-08 and KN-14 road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles, which probably will be able reach Europe or the US West Coast. But those missiles don\u2019t exist, except as parade mock-ups and engineering test articles. When they are completed, they will require years of flight testing to reach operational status, with no doubt many more catastrophic failures. We\u2019ve been watching closely for those tests, and seen only ground tests of isolated components. Seoul has been watching as closely was we have, understands that these missiles are a threat for 2020 or beyond, so why are they making this claim now?

Based on another article they seem closer to launching their sub than an 7500km missile. 38 North says:\nDecember 20, 2016 at 5:28 pm\nThanks Peter. We\u2019ll make the change.

Guam is at 13 degrees N latitude. One legal definition may be found in Annex 1 of the South Pacific Nuclear Weapons Free Zone. Small areas north of the Equator adjacent to parties to the Treaty are included, as are Australian islands in the Indian Ocean. Guam is not in the South Pacific!

Pyongyang on Friday set off its most powerful nuclear explosion to date, saying it had mastered the ability to mount a warhead on a ballistic missile and vowing to continue strengthening its nuclear power. (Reporting by Ju-min Park and Jack Kim; Editing by Peter Cooney; \"\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/northkorea-nuclear-tunnel-idUSS6N14Q044\nThe Diplomat analysis:\n\"Next, there\u2019s the matter of the sixth test. With Friday\u2019s detonation, 2016 became the first year since North Korean detonated its first nuclear device in 2006 to see more than one nuclear test. (Somewhat sadly for the cause of global nonproliferation, Pyongyang\u2019s fifth test came just days before the 20th anniversary of the signing of the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty.) Two data points, of course, don\u2019t portend a trend, but Pyongyang\u2019s sixth test will be a matter of time. South Korean government sources are already telling the press that Pyongyang is gearing up to use a previously unused tunnel at its Punggye-ri testing site to carry out another test.  (For dates, keep October 10, the founding anniversary of the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea, in mind; the date also would mark the decennial of North Korea\u2019s first nuclear test.) Even with the ongoing debates over yield estimates, North Korea is learning quite a bit about nuclear bomb design with each successive test. Another test six to seven months from now would additionally confirm suspicions that North Korea\u2019s HEU and Plutonium stockpiles are comfortable enough for it to carry on testing. The nightmare scenario of a nuclear test from North Korea is an atmospheric detonation over the Sea of Japan involving a Hwasong-10 intermediate-range ballistic missile or Hwasong-13 intercontinental ballistic missile. (The last atmospheric nuclear test was carried out by China in October 1980; India and Pakistan\u2019s 1998 tests were subterranean.)\"\nSee http://thediplomat.com/2016/09/north-koreas-5th-nuclear-test-sends-a-clear-message-but-whos-listening/ The ongoing naval exercises with ROK will be seen as a provocation by DPRK \"The USS Ronald Reagan (CVN-76), the flagship of the Yokosuka, Japan-based Carrier Strike Group Five of the U.S. Navy, will sail to South Korea's Yellow and South Seas to participate in a joint naval exercise with South Korea, slated for Oct. 10-15, the official said\" http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/ne\nand \n\"The USS Ronald Reagan will take part in the combined maritime exercise between the U.S. and South Korean militaries to be carried out in the western and southern seas,\" the official noted.

But the North Koreans aren\u2019t simply repeating old failures.  And they aren\u2019t taking the slow path to developing a reliable system, with a year or so between each test to analyze the data and make improvements. That has been their practice in the past, and it is what we expected this time once they had one successful flight for the cameras. Instead, they are continuing with an aggressive test schedule that involves, at least this time, demonstrating new operational capabilities. That increases the probability of individual tests failing, but it means they will learn more with each test even if it does result in failure. If they continue at this rate, the Musudan intermediate-range ballistic missile could enter operational service sometime next year\u2013much sooner than had previously been expected\"\nand:http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/northkorea/2016/10/18/69/0401000000AEN20161018001300315F.html\n\"The members of the Security Council strongly condemned the most recent failed ballistic missile launch,\" the UNSC said in a press statement unanimously adopted after holding an emergency meeting.\n\"This attempted launch is in grave violation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's international obligations under UNSC resolutions,\" it added.\nThe statement called upon its member countries to \"redouble their efforts\" to fully enforce measures that have been imposed on the North, in particular, the Resolution 2270 adopted in March following its fourth nuclear test earlier in the year. The UNSC also reiterated the importance of keeping peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in the Northeast Asian region, and voiced their commitment to a \"peaceful, diplomatic and political solution\" to the current stalemate over the North's nuclear and missile development programs.

The North has evaded a decade of U.N. sanctions to develop the uranium enrichment process, enabling it to run an effectively self-sufficient nuclear program that is capable of producing around six nuclear bombs a year, they said. The true nuclear capability of the isolated and secretive state is impossible to verify. But after Pyongyang conducted its fifth and most powerful nuclear test last week and, according to South Korea, was preparing for another, it appears to have no shortage of material to test with.\"  quoting Reuters\nhttp://www.korea.net/NewsFocus/Policies/view?articleId=141496\nand the last test followed a missile launch \n\"North Korea appeared to carry out its fifth underground nuclear test on Sept. 9, coinciding with the 68th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The test occurred less than a day after U.S. President Barack Obama left Asia following his attendance at the G-20 and Association of Southeast Asian Nations summits. The test also follows by a few days the most recent series of North Korean Rodong medium-range ballistic missile tests. According to initial reports, a 5.3 magnitude earthquake was detected near the site of North Korea's previous nuclear tests. The seismic signature is similar to previous North Korean tests.\"\nhttps://www.stratfor.com/analysis/north-korea-fifth-nuclear-test  \"On October 13 President  Park stated: \"North Korea carried out its fourth nuclear weapons test at the beginning of the year, followed by a fifth test just last month. The countless provocations, through missile blasts in this year alone, demonstrate the North's fanatical obsession with its weapons programs. This is an indication that the Northern regime will not give up the development of its nuclear weapons, and will likely carry out more nuclear tests and missile launches in the future.\"  \"The North Korean regime now threatens to use its nuclear weapons on the South,\" the president said. \"This is proof that the North's nuclear weapons program is a verifiable threat, a threat that directly targets the Republic of Korea and its people,\" she said.  \"It is for this reason that our government had to make the decision to deploy the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system (THAAD) on the Korean Peninsula, to safeguard our citizens against the North's nuclear threats. Moving forward, I will not compromise on decisions involving the protection of our country and its citizens, regardless of any difficulties that may arrive as I carry out my duties.\"   http://www.korea.net/NewsFocus/Policies/view?articleId=141496 About 90 minutes ago Pentagon announced another failed DPRK ballistic test.\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/us-korea-north-usa-idUSKBN12F0S2\n'The U.S. military detected a failed North Korean test launch of an intermediate ballistic missile near the northwestern city of Kusong, the Pentagon said on Saturday. ( Reuters 1:11 PM PDT) \"We strongly condemn this and North Korea\u2019s other recent missile tests,\" said U.S. Navy Commander Gary Ross, a Pentagon spokesman. \"We intend to raise our concerns at the UN to bolster international resolve in holding the DPRK accountable for these actions.\" Ross said the U.S. commitment to the defense of its allies in the region, including South Korea and Japan, was \"iron-clad\" in the face of such North Korean actions. The Pentagon said the missile launch did not pose a threat to North America.\" Hence, I conclude that a nuclear test is likely before 1-1-2017. I also base this on Pakistans development and assume that progress is similar based on AQ Khan blueprints. In one year Pakistan completed 5 tests.\nhttp://nuclearweaponarchive.org/P\n\"Pakistan's Nuclear Weapons Program\n1998: The Year of Testing\n\"On 6 April 1998 Pakistan conducted its first test of the Ghauri. Pakistani media reports credited the missile with a 1100 km test flight and an apogee of 350 km, but information on the impact point shows that the flight distance was no more than 800 km. The system had a claimed range of 1500 km. While Pakistan has stated publicly that the missile was designed and produced indigenously it was, in fact, a North Korea produced No-dong. This was the second test of a No-dong, and it is believed that DPRK observers were present [Bermudez 1998a]. Although this test did not actually influence India's preparations for the tests held 5 weeks later, it did help create the atmosphere of tension in which the tests were conducted\"\nand then\n\"On 28 May at 15:00 UCT Prime Minister Sharif began his televised address (pre-announced four hours before) with the statement: \"Today, we have settled a score and have carried out five successful nuclear tests.\"\nIn a later address to Pakistani and foreign reporters, Sharif said:\n\"Pakistan today successfully conducted five nuclear tests. The results were as expected. There was no release of radioactivity. I congratulate all Pakistani scientists, engineers and technicians for their dedicated team work and expertise in mastering complex and advanced technologies. The entire nation takes justifiable pride in the accomplishments of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, Dr. A.Q. Khan Research Laboratories and all affiliated Organizations... Our security, and the peace and stability of the entire region, was gravely threatened. As any self-respecting nation, we had no choice left for us. Our hand was forced by the present Indian leadership's reckless actions. We could not ignore the magnitude of the threat... Under no circumstances would the Pakistani nation compromise on matters pertaining to its life and existence. Our decision to exercise the nuclear option has been taken in the interest of national self-defence. These weapons are to deter aggression, whether nuclear or conventional.\"\n\"Six devices constituted a large part of the then available highly enriched uranium, perhaps 90 kg consumed out of 210 kg on hand (although once it had spent a couple of years processing its stockpile of low enriched uranium, this would rise to 800 kg or so). A great deal of Pakistan's immediate nuclear resources would be consumed for quite a gamble on useful results.\"\n I highly recommend this link which details from Pakistani sources including,  A. Q. Khan    fascinating and a basis for forecasts here. Finally I am basing the forecast on satellite imagery. This is a vital website for forecasts and policy at John Hopkins-Nitze Institute:\nhttp://38north.org/2016/10/sohae100816/\n\"A 38 North exclusive with analysis by Jack Liu. Summary Commercial satellite imagery from October 1 supports recent reports of increased activity at the Sohae Satellite Launching Station, including crates on the launch pad next to the gantry tower and vehicles near the fuel and oxidizer buildings. However, since both the gantry tower and the assembly structures on the launch pad are covered, it is unclear whether this activity is related to launch preparations or other operations. Additionally, work continues at the vertical engine test stand. Launch Pad Recent commercial satellite imagery from October 1 shows crates next to the gantry tower on the launch pad and several large vehicles in front of the newly built fuel/oxidizer bunker. However, environmental covers make it impossible to observe if a space launch vehicle or related components are located at the gantry tower or have been moved into the assembly structures.\" The ballistic test today occurred 14 days later \"and Recent commercial satellite imagery of the Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Site from October 1 indicates continuing activity at all three tunnel complexes that could be used to conduct a nuclear test. Activity at the North Portal where the September 9 test occurred, may be for a number of purposes including collecting post-test data, sealing the portal or preparing for another test. There is also increased activity near one of the two entrances at the South Portal where excavation stopped in 2012. The purpose of this activity is also unclear although the portal is assumed to be capable of supporting a nuclear test once a decision is made to move forward\"\nhttp://38north.org/2016/10/punggye100616/.\ncc:@dowser"], [368, "2016-10-15T19:18:39Z", [0.1, 0.9, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [28531, "2016-10-15T18:33:23Z", [0.19, 0.32, 0.2, 0.29], ""], [691, "2016-10-15T14:46:51Z", [0.25, 0.72, 0.03, 0.0], ""], [691, "2016-10-14T21:19:09Z", [0.25, 0.72, 0.03, 0.0], ""], [2965, "2016-10-14T19:27:11Z", [0.79, 0.21, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [368, "2016-10-14T19:17:55Z", [0.1, 0.9, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [12879, "2016-10-14T16:52:12Z", [0.95, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [22245, "2016-10-14T15:57:21Z", [0.6, 0.4, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [29507, "2016-10-14T15:01:42Z", [0.05, 0.15, 0.05, 0.75], ""], [1023, "2016-10-14T14:21:54Z", [0.85, 0.15, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [15621, "2016-10-14T13:33:08Z", [0.03, 0.24, 0.3, 0.43], "Feel it may be next year."], [29568, "2016-10-14T08:31:15Z", [0.15, 0.6, 0.15, 0.1], ""], [29568, "2016-10-14T08:29:56Z", [0.25, 0.5, 0.15, 0.1], ""], [14613, "2016-10-13T21:50:04Z", [0.5, 0.49, 0.01, 0.0], ""], [16181, "2016-10-13T21:02:10Z", [0.85, 0.15, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [22833, "2016-10-13T20:40:47Z", [0.3, 0.45, 0.25, 0.0], ""], [22833, "2016-10-13T20:39:50Z", [0.35, 0.45, 0.2, 0.0], ""], [368, "2016-10-13T20:32:25Z", [0.85, 0.15, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2016-10-13T19:39:40Z", [0.25, 0.72, 0.03, 0.0], ""], [29507, "2016-10-13T19:26:11Z", [0.05, 0.15, 0.05, 0.75], "Once every 3 year pattern, and low stockpile of material.  2 already this year means highly unlikely will see one by end of 2017"], [3225, "2016-10-13T19:09:51Z", [0.65, 0.35, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [2965, "2016-10-13T14:20:18Z", [0.81, 0.19, 0.0, 0.0], "Time and no event this past Monday\n"], [28414, "2016-10-13T08:38:05Z", [0.05, 0.15, 0.1, 0.7], ""], [29145, "2016-10-13T06:02:56Z", [0.01, 0.09, 0.2, 0.7], ""], [368, "2016-10-12T22:14:31Z", [0.85, 0.15, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2016-10-12T20:12:04Z", [0.27, 0.71, 0.02, 0.0], ""], [2965, "2016-10-12T13:35:20Z", [0.87, 0.13, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [29539, "2016-10-12T11:35:08Z", [0.05, 0.55, 0.1, 0.3], "April 25th: Foundation Day (85 years ago) of the Korean Revolutionary Army (1932)"], [28414, "2016-10-12T09:13:37Z", [0.3, 0.2, 0.15, 0.35], ""], [3895, "2016-10-12T09:06:00Z", [0.67, 0.32, 0.01, 0.0], "going down a bit since the significant dates of 9th/10th October passed without incident.

Monitoring stations from the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization detect the seismic activity from the test. The type of device tested remains unclear, although experts doubt it was of a hydrogen bomb based on seismic evidence.  February 7, 2016: North Korea launches a long-range ballistic missile carrying what it has said is an earth observation satellite in defiance of United Nations sanctions barring it from using ballistic missile technology, drawing strong international condemnation from other governments which believe it will advance North Korea's military ballistic missile capabilities. March 2, 2016: The UN Security Council unanimously adopts Resolution 2270 condemning the nuclear test and launch of early 2016, and demanding that North Korea not conduct further tests and immediately suspend all activities related to its ballistic missile program. Resolution 2270 expands existing sanctions on North Korea by adding to the list of sanctioned individuals and entities, introducing new financial sanctions, and banning states from supplying aviation fuel and other specified minerals to North Korea. Resolution 2270 also introduces a requirement that UN member states inspect all cargo in transit to or from North Korea for illicit goods and arms.

The tests are reported as a failure.  May 6-9, 2016: North Korea holds its seventh Congress for its ruling Korean Workers' Party. During the Congress, Kim Jong Un describes North Korea's nuclear policy, saying North Korea \"will not use a nuclear weapon unless its sovereignty is encroached upon by any aggressive hostile forces with nukes, as it had already declared.\" May 30, 2016: North Korea tests another intermediate-range Musudan missile.  May 31, 2016: Satellite imagery analysis from 38 North assess that North Korea is \"preparing to commence or has already begun\u201d reprocessing nuclear material to separate additional plutonium for weapons use. June 21, 2016: North Korea conducts two additional intermediate-range Musudan ballistic missile tests, bringing the total number of Musudan tests to six since April. One of the tests is a partial success, as the missile flew an estimated 400 kilometers. The other explodes in midflight after approximately 150 kilometers. June 22, 2016: The UN Security Council holds an emergency session to consider North Korea's missile tests.  June 23, 2016: The Securirty Council releases a statement strongly condemning North Korea's recent ballistic missile launches and calls on member states to fully implement UN Security Council measures imposed by council resolutions.  July 6, 2016: North Korea signals a willingness to resume negotiations on denuclearization and defines denuclearization in a statement by a government spokesperson.   July 6, 2016: The US Department of Treasury announces designations on top North Korean officials, including the leader, Kim Jong Un, over ties to human rights abuses in North Korea.  July 8, 2016: South Korea and the United States announce a decision to deploy the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense battery (THAAD), to South Korea. The missile defense system is \"a defenisve measure to ensure the security\" of South Korea. THAAD is designed to intercept short and medium-range ballistic missiles.  August 3, 2016: North Korea fires a medium-range ballistic missile, the Nodong. The missile splashes down in Japan's economic exclusion zone, about 200 kilometers off of Japan's coast.  August 24, 2016: North Korea tests an SLBM, the KN-11. The missile ejects from a submarine and flies approximately 500 kilometers on a lofted trajectory before splashing down in the ocean. The test appears to be a success.  September 5, 2016: North Korea tests three medium-range ballistic missiles simultaneously. The missiles travel about 1,000 kilometers.

So, my best guess is that they will run another test in 6-24 months, since they do seem to be increasing the frequency of these tests.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_weapons_tests_of_North_Korea\n"], [577, "2016-10-02T14:44:26Z", [0.04, 0.37, 0.36, 0.23], ""], [26704, "2016-10-02T14:40:11Z", [0.14, 0.63, 0.21, 0.02], "N Korea is determined to show the world that it can and will remain defiant"], [29375, "2016-10-02T01:10:33Z", [0.05, 0.35, 0.6, 0.0], ""], [27798, "2016-10-01T20:53:51Z", [0.05, 0.8, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [368, "2016-10-01T20:11:37Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [23744, "2016-10-01T17:36:25Z", [0.03, 0.85, 0.1, 0.02], ""], [691, "2016-10-01T16:32:23Z", [0.12, 0.63, 0.25, 0.0], ""], [554, "2016-10-01T09:58:45Z", [0.39, 0.45, 0.08, 0.08], ""], [196, "2016-10-01T03:27:13Z", [0.4, 0.3, 0.15, 0.15], ""], [691, "2016-09-30T20:18:19Z", [0.16, 0.6, 0.24, 0.0], ""], [14613, "2016-09-30T19:47:06Z", [0.97, 0.02, 0.01, 0.0], ""], [368, "2016-09-30T19:33:53Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [23206, "2016-09-30T16:08:01Z", [0.1, 0.36, 0.26, 0.28], "I'm sort of following JamesK27's idea of nuclear tests as a Poission process, but I don't think it's fair to assume that the timing of nuclear tests are completely independent of previous tests.

While not as much is known about the Hagap facility, it would likely serve a similar purpose to the Kumchang-ri facility, possibly as a uranium enrichment facility..\nYONGJO-RI URANIUM ENRICHMENT FACILITY\nThe Yongjo-ri complex was initially thought to be just a missile base, but its hidden location in mountainous terrain makes it a potential site for clandestine activities. It has been suspected of being a uranium enrichment facility.\nCHEONMA-SAN URANIUM ENRICHMENT FACILITY\nAccording to South Korean media quoting an alleged Chinese intelligence report, North Korea operates a clandestine uranium enrichment plant at Cheonma-San; a large underground complex buried 2.5 kilometers into a mountain. The site allegedly houses several large chambers where uranium ore is processed into yellowcake.\nKUMNHO-CHIGU LIGHT WATER REACTOR\nThe light-water reactor in Kumnho-chigu has no direct role in the North Korean nuclear weapons program as it does not produce fissile materials that can be used in a nuclear device. Therefore, it does not result in any expertise that has not already been achieved through other facilities.\nTAECHON GAS-COOLED REACTOR\nNorth Korea planned to build a 200MWe reactor at Taechon for the production of plutonium and electricity generation. Construction, however, was suspended indefinitely in return for oil deliveries to North Korea.  South Korean politicians have claimed that North Korea produces plutonium at an underground facility on an island in a man-made lake in Taechon. This alleged facility would be able to extract plutonium, ready for use in nuclear weapons, from spent fuel used by the Yongbyon reactor.\nYONGBYON GAS-COOLED REACTOR\nThe 5 MWe Experimental Power Reactor at Yongbyon was brought online in late 1985. It is a gas-cooled, graphite-moderated reactor that used natural uranium as fuel. The reactor produces plutonium, which can be used for nuclear weapons without further enrichment. The Yongbyon facility houses a reprocessing plant that extracts plutonium from the spent reactor fuel. Yongbyon also hosts an enrichment site that houses gas-centrifuges that can process natural uranium into weapons grade uranium.\nPAKCHON URANIUM MILL\nNorth Korea has acknowledged the existence of a uranium concentrate pilot plant in Pakchon. This concentrate, also known as \u201cyellowcake,\u201d is an essential step in the production of nuclear fuel for reactors.\nSUNCHON URANIUM MINE\nSince the sixties, the Sunchon area has hosted uranium mining and processing operations.

The North also made clear that it will not give in to growing international pressure to dissuade it from pushing forward with its nuclear ambitions, further clouding outlooks for any imminent breakthrough, they predicted.

That's because of an unprecedented series of North Korean missile launches - more than 30 of them this year, according to Bruce Bennett, a senior defense analyst with the California-based Rand Corp. That's far more launches than in any previous year in North Korea's history. The previous high, by Bennett's count, was 16 in 2014. Besides that, the country's dictatorial leader, Kim Jong Un, has conducted five underground nuclear explosions, two of them this year. The last one occurred Sept. 9: a blast of about 10 kilotons, roughly the size of the 1945 nuclear bomb dropped by the United States on Hiroshima, Japan, Bennett said. \"Since Kim Jong Un took over we've seen a lot of changes. There's been an enormous investment in the missile and nuclear program,\" said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Center for Nonproliferation Studies in Monterey, California. \"You see this kind of a huge uptick in activity.\" The escalation could be one way for the nation's 32-year-old leader to project strength in the face of continued international sanctions and isolation, experts say. \"He's pretty clearly not the most capable person,\" Bennett said. \"He figures if he has 100 or 200 nuclear weapons - including (some directed) against the U.S. - no one's going to mess with him.\" For decades, battle-watch teams like the one Col\u00f3n leads have staffed the underground command post at Offutt around the clock, every day of the year. Until 1992 it was run by the Air Force's Strategic Air Command. Now it's the domain of StratCom, which took over SAC's nuclear responsibilities after the Cold War and has since added missions including cyberwarfare, space defense and weapons of mass destruction. \"StratCom's role just keeps getting bigger and bigger,\" said Brig. Gen. John Shaw, StratCom's deputy director of global operations. Kim's missile launches have kept StratCom's watch-standers busier than usual this year. Under the terms of international treaties, countries are supposed to give notice of missile launches as a warning so that aircraft and ships can avoid the area. North Korea used to comply; but lately, Kim hasn't bothered. Which means that alarm can ding quite unexpectedly - as it did at 3:29 p.m. on Aug. 23, during one of Col\u00f3n's recent shifts. Heat sensors on U.S. space satellites instantly detect a rocket launch anywhere on Earth, Shaw said, and the underground command post is alerted. \"Within seconds we got the indicators. Within minutes we're on a conference call,\" Col\u00f3n said. \"Because it's early afternoon, all the bosses already (were) here.\" He quickly notifies Shaw; Maj. Gen. Heidi Brown, StratCom's director of global operations; and Adm. Cecil Haney, StratCom's four-star commander. All necessary personnel are brought together in a videoconference. He also calls other military commands, including U.S. Pacific Command in Hawaii and the North American Air Defense Command in Colorado Springs, Colorado, as well as the Pentagon's National Military Command Center. \"There's a lot of people watching these global events,\" Col\u00f3n said. \"We're constantly in contact. I have data coming in from around the world.\" During the Aug. 23 launch, the StratCom team determined North Korea had launched a KN-11 missile from a GORAE-class ballistic-missile submarine near the port of Sinpo, on the country's east coast. Radar sites in Japan soon picked up the rocket and allowed Col\u00f3n's battle-watch team to follow its path live. \"We have the ability to see what the ground-based radars are seeing,\" said Robert Fabrizzio, StratCom's senior space and missile defense analyst. \"Immediately we know who it came from, where it's going and what type of missile it is.\" Sometimes the North Koreans launch more than one missile. On Sept. 4 they launched three Nodong-1 sub-based missiles simultaneously, and on July 18 they launched three missiles within an hour. But on Aug. 23 the team followed just one: the KN-11 that flew 300 miles southeast - straight in the direction of Tokyo, until it fell harmlessly into the Sea of Japan. \"Once you realize this is probably just going to hit the water, you can end the conference call,\" Col\u00f3n said. Even with the crisis past, the battle watch team's work isn't over. Tapes of the incident are replayed to glean intelligence for reports that are sent up the chain of command. Those reports help the StratCom commander offer military options to the president and his top defense advisers. \"Adm. Haney's job is to give the best possible advice,\" said Julie Ziegenhorn, a StratCom spokeswoman. Col\u00f3n also reviews his team's performance.\"\nAll rights reserved Stratfor from Lexis-Nexis Daily Mail (blog) paywall\nBut after Pyongyang conducted its fifth and most powerful nuclear test last week and, according to South Korea, was preparing for another, it appears to have no shortage of material to test with\" Summary\n body\n\"Assessments by weapons experts say the North has evaded a decade of UN sanctions to develop the uranium enrichment process, enabling it to run an effectively self-sufficient nuclear programme that is capable of producing around six nuclear bombs a year. Meanwhile, North Korea today accused the United States of pushing the Korean Peninsula to 'the point of explosion' after it dispatched two huge bombers in a show of force against Pyongyang. The supersonic B-1B Lancers flew over South Korea Tuesday as Washington vowed its 'unshakeable commitment' to defend its allies in the region following the North's fifth nuclear test. Washington called the demonstration 'just one example of the full range of military capabilities'. It took similar military actions following previous atomic tests. North Korea labelled the flyover by the 'infamous' nuclear bombers as Washington's attempt to seek 'an opportunity of mounting a preemptive nuclear attack,' referring to US plans to deploy further strategic assets to the peninsula. 'These extremely reckless provocations of the US imperialist warmongers are pushing the situation on the Korean peninsula to the point of explosion hour by hour,' the state-run KCNA news agency said. It warned that the North Korean army was fully armed with 'all means for military counteraction' to strike back at any enemy attack in 'a single blow'. Washington is planning to send the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier the USS Ronald Reagan and the Japan-based Carrier Strike Group Five to South Korean waters next month for a joint naval exercise, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency.  South Korea hosts 28,000 US troops as the two Koreas technically remain at war since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice instead of a peace treaty. The bombers' flight came after the North on Friday carried out what it described as a 'nuclear warhead test' and vowed to take further measures to increase its nuclear strike force 'in quality and in quantity'.   The true nuclear capability of the isolated and secretive state is impossible to verify.  But after Pyongyang conducted its fifth and most powerful nuclear test last week and, according to South Korea, was preparing for another, it appears to have no shortage of material to test with. North Korea has an abundance of uranium reserves and has been working covertly for well over a decade on a project to enrich the material to weapons-grade level, experts have said. That project, believed to have been expanded significantly, is likely the source of up to 330lbs of highly enriched uranium a year, said Siegfried Hecker, a leading expert on the North's nuclear programme. That quantity is enough for roughly six nuclear bombs, Hecker, who toured the North's main Yongbyon nuclear facility in 2010, wrote in a report on the 38 North website of Johns Hopkins University in Washington published on Monday. Added to an estimated 32- to 54 kilogram plutonium stockpile, the North will have sufficient fissile material for about 20 bombs by the end of 2016, Hecker said. North Korea said its latest test proved it was capable of mounting a nuclear warhead on a medium-range ballistic missile, but its claims to be able to miniaturise a nuclear device have never been independently verified. Assessments of the North's plutonium stockpile are generally consistent and believed to be accurate because experts and governments can estimate plutonium production levels from telltale signs of reactor operation in satellite imagery. South Korean Defence Minister Han Min-koo this year estimated the North's plutonium stockpile at about 40 kilogrammes. But Hecker, a former director of the US Los Alamos National Laboratory, where nuclear weapons have been designed, has called North Korea's uranium enrichment programme 'their new nuclear wildcard,' because Western experts do not know how advanced it is."], [16168, "2016-09-21T12:50:31Z", [0.6, 0.25, 0.15, 0.0], "test site is already prepared and China will not restrain them"], [29069, "2016-09-21T12:46:15Z", [0.05, 0.25, 0.65, 0.05], ""], [22833, "2016-09-21T12:44:20Z", [0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0], ""], [29069, "2016-09-21T12:43:43Z", [0.05, 0.55, 0.35, 0.05], "Comment deleted on Sep 21, 2016 12:46PM UTC"], [19801, "2016-09-21T12:41:35Z", [0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0], "6 tests to date, but recent 2 tests have happened only 9 month apart. 1.6 years between tests on\naverage.
