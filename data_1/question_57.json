In France, the national economic situation is the key issue driving a wedge between domestic interests and the current EU policy in regard to Russia.  On April 28th, French lawmakers passed a non-binding vote . . . . calling for the end of anti-Russian sanctions. The procedure . . .  was meant to spur the government to engage in a debate concerning the rationality of sanctions on Russia. It followed a call that Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron issued in January 2016 to lift EU sanctions against Russia. Macron\u2019s objective was to end the sanctions regime against Moscow by the summer of 2016 in a bid to restore economic relations between France and Russia and enable the country\u2019s export-oriented sectors to regain access to the lost market. A similar rationale pushed Prime Minister Matteo Renzi to call for a review of EU sanctions against Moscow in late 2015. \"The vote built upon a strong opposition by some sectors of the French economy to the EU-wide policy in regards to Moscow. During nationwide protests held between July and September 2015, French farmers demonstrated against their dire economic situation. Protesters criticised the government for a multitude of reasons including heavy regulation and taxation that weigh heavily on their finances. The demonstrators also voiced a clear opposition to France\u2019s participation in the EU sanctions against Russia that led to Moscow\u2019s counter-measures. The latter have been having a major impact on the farmers\u2019 export-driven meat and dairy production. \"Within the first five months of 2015, the French agricultural sector lost tens of millions of euros because of the negative backlash of EU sanctions. Anti-sanctions protests held by European farmers took place throughout the EU in summer 2015 as labour unions\u2019 officials claimed that the policy toward Russia cost European farmers approximately EUR 5.5 billion. \"On April 6th, the Netherlands held a referendum over the EU Association Agreement with Ukraine. The result of the poll . . . was a clear message of disagreement from a portion of the Dutch electorate in regards to the national government and the EU\u2019s policy over Ukraine, and indirectly Russia. Approximately 60% of those voting expressed their opposition to trade agreements as well as a visa-free policy between the EU and Ukraine. While only over a third of Dutch voted, the result marked a tendency within certain portions of the western European electorate.\n. . . \n\"As the referendum was non-binding, it is highly likely that the Dutch government will proceed with its EU-oriented policy toward Ukraine. The EU has devoted too much political capital toward the integration of the eastern European country and may push through with its policy regardless. The European Commission already proposed a visa-free travel arrangement to Ukraine.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  The way I read this, although the wider electorate opposes the sanctions, governments have too much invested for the EU to drop them.   However, somebody is going to blink first, and I think it will not be Putin; it will be one of the EU countries.  After somebody lifts their sanction on Russia, I think Putin will begin an immediate review of Russia's counter-sanctions, but I think he'll not hurry to lift them--just to rub it in that we gave in first, and to try to show that Russia isn't hurting."], [368, "2016-05-13T17:20:12Z", [0.95, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2016-05-13T14:00:38Z", [0.9, 0.09, 0.01, 0.0], ""], [1708, "2016-05-13T12:42:45Z", [0.85, 0.15, 0.0, 0.0], "Continued Syrian campaign, USA missile defense in Romania and Poland"], [392, "2016-05-13T01:45:18Z", [0.85, 0.15, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [14166, "2016-05-12T20:32:48Z", [0.72, 0.2, 0.0, 0.08], ""], [368, "2016-05-12T19:28:29Z", [0.95, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2016-05-12T14:34:46Z", [0.9, 0.09, 0.01, 0.0], ""], [11471, "2016-05-12T12:39:38Z", [0.5, 0.25, 0.05, 0.2], ""], [15471, "2016-05-12T09:59:56Z", [0.8, 0.18, 0.02, 0.0], ""], [1529, "2016-05-12T06:02:38Z", [0.49, 0.5, 0.01, 0.0], ""], [691, "2016-05-12T03:36:43Z", [0.9, 0.09, 0.01, 0.0], ""], [368, "2016-05-11T21:43:02Z", [0.95, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [12302, "2016-05-11T00:04:04Z", [0.94, 0.05, 0.01, 0.0], ""], [368, "2016-05-10T19:05:33Z", [0.95, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [51, "2016-05-10T13:59:17Z", [0.9, 0.07, 0.03, 0.0], "I cannot believe I am going to try another Russia / food sanctions question.

Putin has shown the ability and willingness to make changes quickly. He has the power, and the loyalty behind him, so he can change quickly across multiple scenarios, e.g., removing some Russian support from Syria; recently re-engaging with the West (through Lavrov): http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/04/19/kerry-and-lavrov-the-odd-couple-of-the-new-cold-war.html. Of course the Western sanctions irked the Russians and, thus the tit-for-tat response, but it seems to me a couple bigger forces are the drivers impacting this IFP. (1) Oil prices have stayed low and will probably remain so, thereby causing ongoing and substantial pressures on the Russian economy, budget, balance of payments, etc.; (2) there appears to be a relative stabilization developing across the Crimea area (not solved, and still risky). Interestingly, Russia has seemed to signal a possible way forward between itself and Ukraine that may start to minimize their mutual conflict, e.g, (4/19/16) \"Last week Kerry and Lavrov discussed on the phone peace terms for the wars in Ukraine, Syria and Nagorno-Karabakh. Although they disagreed about many major issues, including the conditions for a peace agreement in Ukraine\".  Poroshenko hopes Nadezhda Savchenko will be back in Ukraine within weeks. http://tass.ru/en/world/872136 And as an increasing sign of possible movement behind the scenes, there is this from the French Economy Minister: http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/france-hopes-to-see-russia-sanctions-lifted-this-summer-french-economy-minister-1269643 None of this says a big warm and fuzzy is just around the corner, but does indicate shifting landscapes (or calmer waters) behind the scenes.

Western powers also say they have satellite images, videos and other evidence to show Russia is providing weapons to the rebels and that Moscow has troops engaged in the conflict that erupted following Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea in 2014. \"Russia denies such accusations. \"We must not forget that this was an incursion into the sovereign territory of Ukraine, Russia annexed Crimea illegally in international law,\" Hammond said. \"Of course, reforms and steps are needed on the Ukrainian side as well. But we should never equate the two. Russia is the aggressor in this conflict.\" \"Extended at the end of last year, the Minsk peace deal signed by Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany aims to give Ukraine back control of its border with Russia, see all heavy weapons withdrawn, return hostages and allow an internationally monitored local election in the east. \" Hammond told a news conference: \"Russia ignores the norms of international conduct and breaks the rules of the international system.

He has officially not taken part in any previous high-level negotiations with the United States, until now. Analysts said Surkov's involvement indicates Russia is trying now to bring a resolution to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine as a means of seeking relief from Western sanctions \u2014 which have combined with a collapse in global oil prices to deal real damage to the Russian economy. http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/russia-pushing-for-an-endgame-in-ukraine/556437.html http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/USDRUB:CUR\nhttp://www.bloomberg.com/quote/CO1:COM"], [16168, "2016-01-21T19:49:10Z", [0.98, 0.02, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [231, "2016-01-21T04:23:00Z", [0.77, 0.15, 0.0, 0.08], ""], [4634, "2016-01-20T18:28:48Z", [0.6, 0.15, 0.05, 0.2], ""], [10759, "2016-01-20T18:27:45Z", [0.6, 0.15, 0.05, 0.2], ""], [14847, "2016-01-20T16:20:33Z", [0.26, 0.68, 0.06, 0.0], ""], [14847, "2016-01-20T15:55:49Z", [0.19, 0.68, 0.12, 0.01], ""], [691, "2016-01-20T12:41:01Z", [0.58, 0.42, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [102, "2016-01-20T02:41:50Z", [0.68, 0.25, 0.07, 0.0], ""], [38, "2016-01-20T01:45:22Z", [0.95, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0], "http://hungarytoday.hu/news/pm-orban-meet-president-putin-moscow-february-95802  \" . . . .Putin has proposed a meeting with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n as part of his quest to find allies to counterbalance the European Union\u2019s economic sanctions in place against Russia. . . .\n. . .  \n\"Although PM Orb\u00e1n also voted to lengthen the sanctions against Russia, he claimed that Europe \u201cshot itself in the foot\u201d by imposing them because such measures are always against the national interest of economies producing for export.

They said ambassadors from the EU's 28 member states were to meet next week on Wednesday to roll-over punitive measures first adopted after the July 2014 downing of a Malaysia Airlines jet, blamed on pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine. \"It is looking like it will be a rollover for another six months,\" one diplomatic source told AFP.\nAmid differences over what line to take as Brussels and Washington seek Russia's help to resolve the Syrian conflict, the sources said the simplest option was to extend the measures.\n. . . \n\"There was a discussion. Poland wanted to put more sanctions on Russia, others less, so in the end there was a tendency to leave them as they are and extend them for six months,\" another diplomatic source said. \"We want to do this without too much fuss and we do not want to discuss the issue at the summit in December,\" the source said. \"Many eastern European member states are notably more critical of Moscow, fearing Russian intervention in Ukraine shows it wants to reassert its Soviet era influence in the region. \"EU leaders meet December 17-18 for a summit likely to dominated by the twin migrant and Syrian crises which have left the 28-nation bloc scrambling to find an effective response. \"In March, EU leaders agreed to link the economic sanctions to Russia's full implementation of a ceasefire brokered by France and Germany in Minsk. The first diplomatic source said the decision \"will allow us to step back a bit, give us some time\" to see what happens next with the Minsk peace accords. A fresh Franco-German initiative helped bolster the Minsk accord in September, producing a marked decline in ceasefire violations and hopes the agreement might stick after the rebels agreed to postpone elections in areas they control until next year. However, Ukraine has still not regained control of its eastern border with Russia - a key element - and complains that the rebels have not pulled back heavy weapons and allowed international monitors free access. \"The EU has also imposed separate travel ban and asset freeze sanctions on Russian and Ukrainian individuals held responsible for backing the rebels, which run to March, and for those involved in Moscow's annexation of Crimea, which run to June.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  The West won't be lifting sanctions for at least 6 months, it seems, and I do not see Putin crying \"uncle\"."], [689, "2015-12-04T05:35:13Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [689, "2015-12-04T05:33:31Z", [0.9, 0.0, 0.01, 0.09], ""], [73, "2015-12-04T03:40:04Z", [0.45, 0.09, 0.45, 0.01], ""], [11057, "2015-12-04T03:23:04Z", [0.73, 0.27, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [368, "2015-12-03T20:34:22Z", [0.99, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2015-12-03T18:12:19Z", [0.37, 0.63, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [12302, "2015-12-02T23:03:17Z", [0.4, 0.6, 0.0, 0.0], "In light of the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and Syria, the intensifying turkish-russian conflict and the invitation of Montenegro to join the NATO, I don't expect any changes soon (rather I believe, that new countries will be added to the list).

Rather, it is a question of which countries in the coalition are likely to drop their sanctions of Russia.  That game theory is complex, and I do not have a high degree of certainty here.  Assumptions:\na) EU will stick together\nb) The countries who most want to end sanctions (for economic reasons) are in the EU \nc) The US and EU are unlikely to put much space between them given the numerous fronts they are dealing with Russia on today (Ukraine, Syria, Iran, etc) As a consequence, I would guess it is more likely than not that it will be all-or-nothing outcome, and the most critical thing to know is whether EU is serious about ending sanctions as a result of improvements in Ukraine / how hard-line a stance they will take. Tusk is signaling they are not satisfied as of today: http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/11/04/us-ukraine-russia-eu-sanctions-idUSKCN0ST1YR20151104  Although individual leaders (Hollande) have been more positive, each has political reasons to do so.  Ending sanctions is a pretty big deal given the leverage they provide, and so I would expect we will see softer language and increased cooperation ahead of that.  The situation remains somewhat fluid, so it's hard to imagine the EU would move forward in giving up its big stick quite yet.  None: 60% - better than a coin flip, but uncertain situation\n1-5: 2%, most unlikely outcome.  Would mean someone outside EU settles alone, or EU breaks.  Can't really see a path to this happening, but never say never.\nMore than 5, not all:  5% - EU settles, but US or other outliers remain.  This is possible, but I do not think it is likely.\nAll:  33% - EU settles, others fall in line.  I'm not holding my breath, but things really have improved in Ukraine, and obvious economic and political incentives on both sides to end sanctions.

The food embargo policy, though criticised within Russia, is not sufficiently impactful to induce a politically-motivated reversal. Russia has suffered economically as a result of the sanctions imposed on it however Putin will not lift sanctions unilaterally, in an effort to trigger a lifting of sanctions imposed upon it, as it would demonstrate political weakness. I see a stalemate remaining unless France can indeed mobilse sufficient support internationally to begin the process of lifting the sanctions on Russia.
