The protests started over the rising costs of bread and fuel, but have since widened to call for the overthrow of President Omar al-Bashir.  In less than a week, the demonstrations which began on December 19 in the city of Atbara quickly spread across the country, including to the capital Khartoum. In some cities, security forces have used tear gas on protesters and witnesses report the use of batons and live ammunition by riot police. Protesters have attempted to storm official buildings and set fire to tyres in the streets.  At least 12 people have been killed, according to official estimates. Opposition groups say the death toll is higher.
