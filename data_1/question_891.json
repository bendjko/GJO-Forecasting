I also looked at the Honda Clarity sales/leases which had a similar uplift starting Nov '17 but haven't had the same drop from Dec '17 onward.

Total world wide sales at 1035, for the quarter.  Based on the same sales ratios between Japan and US, expected sales for q2 is 1255.  However, the official tracker does not give you means to track japanese sales.  So should this figure only be us sales?\nThe official tracker does let you track european sales, however.

I don't think the merits of hydrogen technology will matter all that much for this question. A more important consideration is that the general public is relatively unfamiliar with hydrogen relative to EVs or hybrids and this is not going to change in three months. Also, this is subjective (and I place almost zero weight on it) but the Mirai is a strange looking car. Poor aesthetics mean that it will take more to convince somebody to buy something unfamiliar.

A bit of a silly question for us to forecast on if we can't see the monthly sales data. Need to find another source. I'm surprised there isn't a central govt database besides VIN. Since VINs are random selections given to each chassis/engine as they're made based on the manufacturers make and model we can't really use that.

Some facts:  1.   Greater range than most EVs at 312 miles. \n2.  No reduction in range in cold Weather. \n3.  Fillup time measured in 3-5 minutes, not 3-5 hours. \n4.  Contrary to car enthusiasts, who claim that battery technology has room to grow and fuel cells do not - \nFuel cells have room to shrink.  Current projections will decrease the size of the fuel cell by 50% in the next generation decreasing the cost of the vehicle and increasing the range.  Toyota is rolling out hydrogen refueling stations as promised.  30 in CA, to which 19 will be added this year and a further 12 between Boston  and NYC. Toyota has a history of meticulous engineering and smooth rollouts.   Straightline linear projects of last years sales is over 1500.   I believe they will add more incremental.

Thus, for now, I do not expect overall demand for fuel cell cars to jump drastically. Toyota has sold 379 units in during Jan & Feb of 2018. To exceed the various thresholds, Toyota will have to average the following monthly sales for the next 4 months:\n900 --> average 104/mo\n1200 --> average 164/mo\n1500 --> average 224/mo\n1800 --> average 355/mo\nToyota has sold an average of 226 Mirai's over the past 6 months. If this continues, Toyota will be on track to sell over 1500 cars in by June 30. However, the Mirai sales curve has been declining by an average of 67 cars/mo. from its peak in December. This suggests that the sustainable rate will be less than the baseline predicted rate of 226 cars/mo.  How much lower depends on 3 major factors: (1) fuel cell car sales growth depends on easy access to refueling stations. With no major increases in refueling stations predicted over the next 4 months, car sales will remain constrained. (2) Vehicle cost and design remain a serious limitations. Compared to the Camry, the Mirai costs $25k more. Styling of the Mirai is also undesirable. (3) The Mirai faces serious competition from the Honda Clarity Hybrid. The Mirai lacks EV ability. No driver wants to be stranded with an empty tank. As a result, Clarity sales figures have skyrocketed compared to the Mirai, with 3512 sold in the past 3 months vs. 675.  I believe Honda will continue to cannibalize FC vehicle sales from Toyota until Toyota responds such as improving styling, dropping the cost, or offering a hybrid version.  With these 3 factors, I predict that Mirai sales will remain flat at 166/mo through June, putting it on track to sell slightly more than 1200 cars by mid-year. I have a difficult time seeing sales plummet to less than 104/mo. over the next 4 months. https://www.thecarconnection.com/car-compare-results/honda_fcx-clarity_2018-vs-toyota_mirai_2018"], [5018, "2018-03-04T15:55:45Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0], ""], [36147, "2018-03-04T14:39:26Z", [0.07, 0.18, 0.42, 0.28, 0.05], ""], [34267, "2018-03-04T14:36:01Z", [0.05, 0.2, 0.5, 0.2, 0.05], ""], [46376, "2018-03-04T11:56:34Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.7, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [19801, "2018-03-04T10:41:52Z", [0.0, 0.3, 0.65, 0.05, 0.0], "Last year total was 2017 \t1.838.
