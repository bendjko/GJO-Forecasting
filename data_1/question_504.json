If the current rate of casualties within the question's time-frame (~12 found through various web searches), and the fact that we are 2/3 through the time period, seems to point to about 18 total fatalities before July 1st, barring any changes in the political / skirmish situation.

Estimates for the entirety of 2017 show about 50 combat deaths, which included 2 deadly attacks in February (not included in the time period for the question). Since June 2017, fighting in the region has been mostly limited to occasional skirmishes and disputes. Although data on all fatalities (not just combat) is not readily available, I would expect that lower levels of fighting between either Armenia or Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan would result in a reduced number of civilian and third-party casualties as well. The number of fatalities for this time period is already in the 10-99 range and there is a low chance fatalities will exceed 99 in the given time period due to this reduced fighting. For this reason, I think there is an 88% chance that between 20 June 2017 and 1 July 2018 there will be 10-99 fatalities and only a 12% chance for 100-999 fatalities. I think there is a 0% chance for 1,000 or more fatalities because that would require a scale of fighting that would severely interrupt oil and gas exports in the region, which goes against the broader interests Azerbaijan. \nhttps://www.cfr.org/interactives/global-conflict-tracker?marker=23#!/conflict/nagorno-karabakh-conflict\nhttps://eurasianet.org/s/karabakh-more-relative-calm-ahead-in-2018\n"], [52343, "2018-02-13T01:10:35Z", [0.0, 0.55, 0.45, 0.0], ""], [1034, "2018-02-12T16:58:42Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2018-02-12T15:13:24Z", [0.0, 0.97, 0.03, 0.0], ""], [1034, "2018-02-11T20:47:53Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1034, "2018-02-11T00:27:24Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2018-02-10T12:58:24Z", [0.0, 0.97, 0.03, 0.0], ""], [52113, "2018-02-10T03:42:53Z", [0.0, 0.25, 0.72, 0.03], ""], [1034, "2018-02-09T20:49:48Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1034, "2018-02-08T22:13:09Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2018-02-08T12:43:25Z", [0.0, 0.97, 0.03, 0.0], ""], [1646, "2018-02-08T00:28:37Z", [0.0, 0.97, 0.03, 0.0], ""], [23006, "2018-02-07T02:44:28Z", [0.0, 0.99, 0.01, 0.0], "http://www.dw.com/en/russia-deploys-nuclear-capable-missile-system-in-kaliningrad-reports/a-42474925?maca=en-RSS_en_Flipboard-9487-xml-media I'm closer to 10 than 99 so not raising yet"], [1034, "2018-02-06T21:20:18Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [40342, "2018-02-06T14:45:32Z", [0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.1], ""], [19801, "2018-02-06T06:38:49Z", [0.0, 0.95, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [23006, "2018-02-05T02:46:29Z", [0.0, 0.99, 0.01, 0.0], ""], [1034, "2018-02-04T21:46:33Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1034, "2018-02-03T19:58:58Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2018-02-03T18:47:09Z", [0.0, 0.97, 0.03, 0.0], ""], [1034, "2018-02-02T19:20:34Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1993, "2018-02-02T07:27:36Z", [0.0, 0.95, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [1034, "2018-02-01T08:47:28Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [50048, "2018-01-31T14:43:26Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1034, "2018-01-30T17:29:36Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [31485, "2018-01-30T09:10:41Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2018-01-29T21:16:40Z", [0.0, 0.97, 0.03, 0.0], ""], [1034, "2018-01-29T17:11:10Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [49001, "2018-01-28T22:15:53Z", [0.05, 0.85, 0.05, 0.05], "Everything recently has been very low casualty conflict, so if that continues, which with the current air of rebellion in different areas seems likely, more tit-for-tat retaliation seems likely, but I don\u2019t think Russia will allow a large scale escalation in it\u2019s sphere of influence."], [1034, "2018-01-27T21:47:21Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1034, "2018-01-26T18:34:45Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1034, "2018-01-25T18:24:03Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2018-01-25T13:07:37Z", [0.0, 0.97, 0.03, 0.0], ""], [1646, "2018-01-24T20:55:29Z", [0.0, 0.92, 0.08, 0.0], ""], [691, "2018-01-24T20:39:45Z", [0.0, 0.97, 0.03, 0.0], ""], [1034, "2018-01-24T17:37:04Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2018-01-24T16:10:12Z", [0.05, 0.9, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [36967, "2018-01-24T15:12:20Z", [0.1, 0.85, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [13377, "2018-01-23T20:03:10Z", [0.0, 0.9, 0.08, 0.02], ""], [46854, "2018-01-23T19:53:36Z", [0.15, 0.8, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [1034, "2018-01-23T17:41:38Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [37053, "2018-01-22T16:37:36Z", [0.0, 0.95, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [36309, "2018-01-22T02:53:44Z", [0.0, 0.95, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [1034, "2018-01-21T18:32:31Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1034, "2018-01-20T18:04:34Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2018-01-19T15:58:04Z", [0.0, 0.94, 0.06, 0.0], ""], [4634, "2018-01-19T15:19:23Z", [0.0, 0.9, 0.08, 0.02], ""], [31756, "2018-01-19T12:36:15Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [46458, "2018-01-19T09:30:44Z", [0.0, 0.8, 0.2, 0.0], "A Guess?"], [1034, "2018-01-19T08:47:58Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1034, "2018-01-18T17:12:22Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [34353, "2018-01-18T12:11:41Z", [0.0, 0.97, 0.03, 0.0], ""], [13377, "2018-01-18T03:59:38Z", [0.0, 0.95, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [172, "2018-01-17T22:00:36Z", [0.0, 0.95, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [46208, "2018-01-17T21:01:11Z", [0.0, 0.7, 0.15, 0.15], ""], [45821, "2018-01-17T18:09:45Z", [0.3, 0.6, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [41922, "2018-01-17T09:11:24Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], "\nThis is part of bigger picture.\nIn Nagorno-Karabakh conflict,  Armenia (Nagorno-Karabakh Defense Army) is backed by Russia and Azerbaijan is backed by Turkey. Nothing serious will happen here without Putin's or Erdogan's permission.  It was clearly seen in 2015/2016 when Turkey downed Russian fighter jet over Syria conflict in Nagorno Karabakh escalated and casualties skyrocketed. After 2016 failed coup in Turkey relations between Putin and Erdogan improved significantly. Probably thanks to the fact that Putin warned Erdogan. Why he did it despite recently dawned plane? Putin needed ally in Syria rather then foe as well as he  took opportunity to create disagreement among strong NATO members Turkey and USA. Now Erdogans blames USA for supporting failed coup.  There is also Soccer World cup happening in Russia in June/July 2018. Putin won't let any conflict involving Russia during that time.

ICG highlight that the two parties are \u201ccloser to war than at any stage since 1994\u201d (https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/caucasus/nagorno-karabakh-azerbaijan/244-nagorno-karabakhs-gathering-war-clouds). The climate \u2013 as has been noted by journalists and think tanks, is certainly increasingly strained, but it seems more likely that associated violence would play out as an increasing number of small scale skirmishes rather than a conflict that would claim over 1000 lives. I believe this primarily because neither side benefits from full scale, wide ranging conflict, and nor do the main international actors, including Russia. While it cannot be ruled out entirely that either an ill-judged decision or an unintentional escalation could lead to a conflict protracted enough to kill over 1000 people, it is therefore less likely than the other alternatives. Two other options remain, and while I expect that any casualty toll will fall into these two buckets it is not easy to choose between the two. Ultimately, historical figures suggest that the baseline is under 100 casualties a year. The trend appears to be towards increasing violence (certainly the last 3 years have seen increasingly bad flare-ups), and with early ceasefire breaches and continuing bellicose rhetoric it tilts me to upgrade the possibility that deaths may rise above the historical baseline. If there were to be one or more escalations like last April that nonetheless remained brief and contained that would also strengthen the likelihood of the final toll falling between 100-999. This leads me to strengthen that bucket, despite the lower historical average. \n"], [1034, "2017-07-11T06:08:28Z", [0.0, 0.85, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [35569, "2017-07-11T03:21:32Z", [0.0, 0.8, 0.2, 0.0], "Azerbaijan is the state that holds the most power in the conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region.

Clearly occuring, on average, at least annually. Poltical situation in AM and AZ not markedly changed from the recent past. In Armenia, the nationalist Dashnaqs   (who might be expected to take a harder line than the majoritarian Republicans, who themselves have close links with NK)  have been in governing coalition since early 2016. Azerbaijan leadership has remained, in many regards, subsequently unchanged for years. The president is given to ranting fairly frequently (including on Twitter - English version https://twitter.com/presidentaz ) aggressively about the evils of \"Armenian aggression\" , and nationalism (and the rewriting of history with regards to anything that pertains to Armenia or Armenians) is a fervent obsesssion. External political situation. The conflict has been \"managed\" above all by the Minsk Group of the OSCE (co-chairs: USA, France, Russia).   However - it may not be a priority of the current US Administration, while in practice in recent years Russia has taken a greater leadership stance, while selling weapons to both parties.  In theory Russia might be expected to be a closer ally of Armenia, but, as with other networks on relationships in the Caucasus - never mind the greater Middle East - it's complicated.  Could Macron (as the new president of a country that has a non-negligiable Armenian diaspora) push for a de-escalation of tensions between AM and AZ? It's not impossible, but also clearly not uppermost on his in-tray. Foreseeable factors that might promote escalation? None immediately obvious. Next elections in Armenia (which tend to be at least semi-competitive) aren't due until 2022 (although there is the potential for tensions relating to changes in the constitutional balance of powers).  Next elections in Azerbaijan, for the president (the outcome of which is pretty much determined in advance), are due in October 2018, a bit beyond the time span under consideration here. Measures by the de facto Karabakh authorities could also be a trigger. So, stagnation and continuation of existing levels of tension/conflict might be the most probable outcome,unless some major escalation occurs. There could be numerous triggers for this (even tied into the greater Russia-Turkey relations).
