In Congress, incumbents have a higher probability of winning reelection. In November of 2004, 401 of the 435 sitting members of the U.S. House of Representatives sought reelection. Of those 401, all but five were reelected. In other words, incumbents seeking reelection to the House had a better than 99% success rate. In the U.S. Senate, only one incumbent seeking reelection was defeated. Twenty-five of twenty-six (96%) were reelected. I assume this can translate to governors. With this, I make my baseline estimate at 78%. A recent poll states that there is a dead even tie in North Carolina between Pat McCrory (41%) and Roy Cooper (41%). This makes things very difficult to predict. North Carolina is a swing state and is divided by Republicans and Democrats. Because of this I lower my estimate by 20%. In this state, it seems that the incumbency effect will not nearly be as strong. 58%. http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2015/PPP_Release_NC_52416.pdf Why would Pat McCrory be re-elected? According to this article, as of May 26, Pat McCrory has a 5 point lead, 45% to 40% against Cooper despite the recent outrage for the HB2. This is subject to change but with this I increase my probability slightly (2-4%) to 62%. http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/05/26/transgender-north-carolina-mccrory-15-points/ Why would he not be re-elected? Recently, Pat McCrory has signed House Bill 2 which is also called Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act which mandates that people can only go into bathrooms that correspond with the gender on their birth certificate. This affects many gay, lesbian, transgender, and intersex people. In North Carolina, it has sparked public outrage, caused music performers to cancel shows, and motivated certain companies to pull out investments. The Center for American Progress estimates that this will cost the state half a billion dollars in lost private sector economic activity. The United States Department of Justice has filed two lawsuits against McCrory stating that this violates federal civil rights laws. This will obviously make democratic voters vote against him but because North Carolina has a very even Republican and Democratic split, I don\u2019t see this lowering his chances by too much.

During that time, he was seen as a moderate conservative and enjoyed bipartisan support. During the 2012 race, he campaigned as a strict conservative, enjoying support from the tea party movement and other far-right groups. McCrory, however, disputed criticism that he had shifted his views. \nAn analysis of Republican governors by Nate Silver of the New York Times in April 2013 ranked McCrory as the ninth most conservative governor in the country.\nhttps://ballotpedia.org/Pat_McCrory\n https://www.patmccrory.com/2016/06/02/attorney-general-reverses-course-federal-litigation/\nOn the Friday before Memorial Day weekend, Attorney General Roy Cooper told a federal court that his office intends to appear on behalf of the State of North Carolina in the lawsuit involving the U.S. Department of Justice. This quiet reversal of the Attorney General\u2019s public position comes after his office repeatedly indicated he would not defend the state in any lawsuit involving a common-sense law to protect privacy in bathrooms, locker rooms and shower facilities.\nHis filings also indicate that his office engaged in conversations with the U.S. Department of Justice prior to entering the case. The Attorney General reversed his position without consulting any of the defendants in the lawsuit, and he did not make any public announcement that he had entered the case to represent the State of North Carolina.\nBoth the Attorney General and his campaign made public statements as recently as yesterday that undermine the state\u2019s position and contradict the legal filings by his office. Therefore, in light of the conflicting statements by the Attorney General, Governor McCrory filed notice in federal court that his administration intends to represent and defend the State of North Carolina in its lawsuit.\n(It seems that the Gov. doubt the tenacity with which the AG will defend the states position, so there is a fight over who has standing, with the Gov.Office insisting that THEY will represent the state in this matter.) Governor Pat McCrory has maintained that HB2 is a commonsense bill, meant to preserve the safety and privacy of individuals in their most vulnerable and private of places \u2013 the bathrooms and shower rooms around North Carolina. Attorney General Roy Cooper, Democrat challenger for the Governor\u2019s seat, has towed the social justice warrior line and declared the bill \u201canti-transgender,\u201d refusing to do his job and defend the state against the lawsuit brought by Obama\u2019s Department of (social) Justice.\nOn Thursday, Governor McCrory\u2019s office revealed that AG Cooper had quietly filed with federal court his office\u2019s intentions to defend the state against the federal lawsuit.\nThe filing came the Friday before Memorial Day weekend, with little fanfare.\nWhile Cooper\u2019s office insists the filing was just an admission that the state deserves a defense, and a request for an extension of time to find representation, McCrory spokesman, Ricky Diaz, is calling for Cooper to resign, based on conflicting statements and neglecting his duties, as AG.\nhttp://www.redstate.com/sweetie15/2016/06/03/nc-gov.-pat-mccrorys-spokesman-calls-attorney-general-roy-cooper-resign-failure-job/"], [83, "2016-06-04T23:07:42Z", [0.5], ""], [22243, "2016-06-04T22:21:49Z", [0.48], ""], [1333, "2016-06-04T22:14:20Z", [0.75], ""], [5863, "2016-06-04T21:16:28Z", [0.35], ""], [21964, "2016-06-04T11:50:26Z", [0.8], ""], [500, "2016-06-04T10:03:23Z", [1.0], ""], [484, "2016-06-04T03:24:59Z", [0.45], "Inclination may be yes, but economic blow back might be hard to ignore."], [4782, "2016-06-04T02:40:17Z", [0.5], ""], [556, "2016-06-04T00:45:15Z", [0.45], "I just hate to start at 50%, so I'm starting slightly under. \nhttp://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/governor/\nBut I'll be watching the polls closely.
