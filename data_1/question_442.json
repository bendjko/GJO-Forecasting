On the face of it their desire for changing or scrapping the agreement is the current difficulty of forming a Northern Ireland  Government, but there is a strong suspicion is that their real motive is that the GFA creates a problem for Brexit (only Brexiteers have suggested that the GFA needs to be changed). It is the GFA that established, and continues to ensure, that the border between NI and Eire has no physical presence, which contradicts the UK Governments position that Brexit will mean leaving the Single Market and Customs Union, which legally means there must be a physical border between NI and Eire.  It is the GFA that also gives the voters of NI the right to hold a referendum on union with Ireland, so no GFA, no right to the referendum in this question. What would happen without the GFA (or a replacement agreed and approved by the people of NI) I don't know, but I suspect that not many people in Ireland and NI are in any hurry to find out.   The irony is that the GFA was put to a referendum on 1998 and 71% of of NI voters approved it.  What was put to voters, and overwhelmingly approved, was not a vague  idea for a peace deal, but a fully detailed peace deal that had taken years of negotiations. It is strange that the Brexiteers believe that the referendum on Brexit (no details, certainly no agreement yet 20 months after the referendum) won by a small margin represents \"the will of the people\", cannot be changed and no vote can be allowed on the final deal agreed, while the GFA referendum can be thrown out because it is inconvenient. I hope we do not need to wait for 20 years before \"the will of the people\" on Brexit can be reconsidered. Of course NI did not want Brexit either, but I guess that can be ignored. https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/20/ireland-kate-hoey-good-friday-agreement-remarks\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/21/mps-accuse-kate-hoey-of-putting-brexit-before-northern-ireland-peace"], [691, "2018-02-21T19:27:51Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2018-02-21T19:05:50Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2018-02-21T06:33:29Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2018-02-21T02:45:23Z", [0.0], ""], [22994, "2018-02-20T14:16:31Z", [0.05], ""], [1034, "2018-02-20T06:03:27Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2018-02-20T02:31:19Z", [0.0], ""], [37224, "2018-02-19T13:56:55Z", [0.01], "It appears that the inability to come to agreement regarding a power sharing government has monopolized attention away from the Brexit vote.

The UK Government depends of Parliamentary support in Westminster from the DUP, so has no leverage over the DUP in creating a new devolved NI government. The DUP risks pushing opinion in the UK in general and in NI in particular towards the idea that a united Ireland would be less trouble that the status quo. For example a United Ireland would solve the Irish border problem that could wreck Brexit so Brexiteers might see the DUP as a Brexit block, but without the DUP May's government would fall so maybe there would be no Brexit.

Thus, if nothing changes, the situation is gravitating towards option 3.

The problem of what Brexit deal would keep the Irish border totally open is made clear, but the consequence of not keeping it open is not fully explored, but only considered in relation to the DUP support for the May government. If the UK proposes a deal with the EU that would result in a hard Irish border the polls show that most voters in N. I. would support the idea of a referendum to unite with Ireland. Bloomberg have considered what the DUP might do in that case, but have not considered that the DUP's views do not match the majority view of Brexit (most in N.I. were against Brexit) nor that the peace agreement requires that if the population demands it a referendum on a united Ireland must be held. The polls also show that if the Brexit deal would result in a hard Irish border and a referendum on a united Ireland were called it would (according to the recent polls) result in a united Ireland. This is regardless of the support for the political parties, and regardless of religious background. Breaking up the U.K. is not something that the Conservative Party of Mrs May would contemplate. For many of its voters that would be a worse outcome than no Brexit. \nSo in my view the question of a united Ireland referendum is part of a row of dominoes; if May insists on leaving the EU Single Market and Customs Union a hard Irish border becomes certain; if there is a hard Irish border, N.I. would unite with Ireland and leave the UK (with the risk that Scotland would also leave the UK); the breakup of the UK is not what the Brexit supporters want; so the UK will not risk it happening. If N.I remains in the Single Market/Customs union in order keep the Irish border open, but the rest of the UK does not that will still lead to demands for a united Ireland (and for Scotland to have a similar deal.) \nSo which ever way May's government approaches it, the logical contradictions do not allow both leaving the EU Single Market/Customs union and keeping an open border with Ireland.      https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-03/the-year-that-makes-or-breaks-brexit P.S. My experience of \"problem solving\" is that you should start by establishing what the \"problem\" is, not start by thinking about setting red lines on what \"solutions\" you want or don't want. So with Brexit a list of what the problems are with the status quo would be good idea. What is wrong with the existing \"Freedom of Movement\", what is wrong with the existing EU Trade deals, what is wrong with the ECJ?  What are the EU rules that cause problems? We know that the EU Single Market and Customs union allow an open border with Ireland (and the whole EU) but I have not heard much about the problems it currently causes. We are told that it prevents the UK making deals with third countries, but that problem could be solved by the EU making deals with third countries (as it is with Canada and Japan and has with South Korea, as has been discussed with India, USA, Australia & New Zealand etc.) Many say that Brexit is really a vote against \"Freedom of Movement\" but some say its too many EU migrants, some say its the wrong sort of migrants. The EU Freedom of Movement rules allow for restrictions in cases of social or economic problems, so why is the UK not explaining what its problem is and looking to deal with that? If there are bad EU rules lets know what they are so they can be discussed, maybe other EU countries also think they are bad. If as a Systems Analyst and Systems Designer I had approached Brexit in the way that the UK Government has I suspect I would not have completed any successful projects.

It appears to me that Brexit is sightly more palatable than integration.   http://www.irishnews.com/news/2017/03/11/news/are-we-any-closer-to-a-border-poll--960596/"], [1034, "2018-01-02T17:33:30Z", [0.0], ""], [45695, "2018-01-02T16:35:14Z", [0.75], ""], [45695, "2018-01-02T16:14:46Z", [0.75], ""], [691, "2018-01-02T13:35:45Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2018-01-01T21:41:27Z", [0.0], ""], [43691, "2018-01-01T21:08:09Z", [0.51], ""], [44308, "2018-01-01T14:29:58Z", [0.0], ""], [45284, "2018-01-01T11:54:27Z", [0.15], "UK is focused almost myopically on Brexit and anything that threatens  to derail the plan or even that focus will be ignored"], [21884, "2018-01-01T04:39:01Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-12-31T19:02:16Z", [0.0], ""], [43870, "2017-12-31T17:07:46Z", [0.15], ""], [1034, "2017-12-31T16:05:09Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-12-31T13:59:37Z", [0.0], ""], [43682, "2017-12-31T11:08:33Z", [0.02], ""], [368, "2017-12-31T03:32:54Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-12-30T21:14:36Z", [0.0], ""], [73, "2017-12-30T19:55:31Z", [0.0], ""], [11800, "2017-12-30T11:30:05Z", [0.0], "I rather judge that there will be set a second vote on Brexit execution, rather than on this single very issue."], [1034, "2017-12-30T11:08:24Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-12-29T21:03:06Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-12-29T08:57:23Z", [0.0], ""], [21884, "2017-12-29T03:10:30Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-12-29T01:53:40Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-12-28T11:32:06Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-12-27T21:25:50Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-12-27T07:48:07Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-12-27T01:56:12Z", [0.0], ""], [530, "2017-12-26T21:15:24Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-12-26T20:32:33Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-12-26T05:43:18Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-12-25T21:51:32Z", [0.0], ""], [43055, "2017-12-25T16:32:27Z", [0.25], "The question should be will the UK government allow a referendum?"], [1034, "2017-12-25T07:45:06Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-12-25T01:01:49Z", [0.0], ""], [42612, "2017-12-24T08:15:08Z", [0.17], ""], [21884, "2017-12-24T06:41:13Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-12-24T05:56:27Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-12-24T02:36:57Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-12-23T07:57:27Z", [0.0], ""], [42794, "2017-12-23T04:58:42Z", [0.45], ""], [368, "2017-12-23T03:20:08Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-12-22T21:33:19Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-12-22T17:39:19Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-12-22T11:11:53Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-12-21T23:45:04Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-12-21T15:23:30Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-12-20T19:15:32Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-12-20T05:15:43Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-12-20T02:47:41Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-12-19T22:29:36Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-12-19T05:26:19Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-12-19T05:24:13Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-12-19T01:01:57Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-12-18T05:35:43Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-12-18T02:51:06Z", [0.0], ""], [30400, "2017-12-17T17:18:01Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-12-17T07:01:03Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-12-16T20:49:53Z", [0.0], ""], [37379, "2017-12-16T19:22:25Z", [0.02], "Dateline 12-13-2017 In the early hours of Friday morning, as British Prime Minister Theresa May was driven home from Downing Street to catch two hours of sleep ahead of her dash to Brussels, an opinion poll was published in Northern Ireland. It reported a sensational result. For the first time, a majority in Northern Ireland (51 percent after factoring out undecideds, nonvoters, and spoilers) supported unification under the Irish Republic to remain in the European Union in the event of a \u201chard\u201d Brexit. London\u2019s \u201chard\u201d Brexit plans, which entail leaving the EU\u2019s internal market and customs union as well as its political structures, had caused the solid, pro-U.K. \u201cUnionist\u201d majority that had existed since Northern Ireland\u2019s creation in 1921, to evaporate. The Good Friday Agreement of 1998 brought Northern Ireland\u2019s sectarian conflict to an end and abolished the militarized frontier with the Republic of Ireland. The reintroduction of a hard border, staffed by customs officers managing the EU\u2019s external boundary, would not just bring back memories of past violence, it would provide targets for Irish republican terrorists at which to aim.  -- http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/12/13/theresa-may-just-negotiated-away-the-united-kingdom/"], [1034, "2017-12-16T05:32:43Z", [0.0], ""], [41270, "2017-12-15T19:39:12Z", [0.0], ""], [14493, "2017-12-15T18:40:24Z", [0.0], "In a set of polls conducted in December 2017 in Northern Ireland the the majority (excluding don't knows) would be in favour of a border poll on the status of NI if there is no deal on Brexit with the EU, and if that poll took place most would prefer uniting with Eire and staying in the EU, to remaining in the UK and leaving the EU. \nThe UK failing to have any Brexit deal with the EU is not very likely (5% to 10% chance?) and its likely that negotiations will still be taking place when this question ends, so its very unlikely that this question will be \"Yes\".

The political crisis that deepened dramatically late on Monday has left the country\u2019s two main parties with less than 24 hours to head off a general election in a dispute that cast a shadow over a key Brexit summit next month Ireland will play a major role at the meeting, telling EU leaders whether it believes sufficient progress has been made on the future of the border between EU-member Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland. The pressure on Deputy Prime Minister Frances Fitzgerald of Varadkar\u2019s Fine Gael party mounted on Monday following the release of fresh documents about her disputed handling of a police whistleblower who alleged corruption in the force. Fianna Fail, whose backing Varadkar requires from the opposition benches to keep his government functioning, has said it will move a motion of no confidence in Fitzgerald at 2000 GMT on Tuesday unless she quits, a position that hardened on Monday (para. 1-5).

As the UK economy in general and N.I. economy in particular seem to be heading for permanent low growth the risk of a United Ireland might seem more attractive. Clearly a united Ireland would not appeal to all in N.I. and a referendum would be very divisive, so the UK government would try and avoid anything that encourages the idea. For this reason the UK priority will be (ought to be) to avoid giving any reason for people in N.I. to think a United Ireland would be better than remaining in the UK. For that reason having an open border with Eire even if it means N.I. staying in the EU Customs Union is a lower risk than having a hard border. If Republicans don't like the Brexit deal they can campaign to resolve it by uniting with Eire; if the Unionists don't like the Brexit deal all they could do would be to allow May's UK government to fall, which would probably result in a new UK government without the DUP that would still not give the Unionists what they wanted. So regarding the Customs Union and N.I it seems to be \"heads I win, tails you lose\".\nI think the real question will turn out to be does the whole UK remain in the EU Customs Union or is N.I, in and the rest of the UK out. That will be more difficult to square with the Brexit vote, as areas like Scotland and London will demand that they should not be made to suffer being out, when they voted to Remain.

Sinn Fein must reach out and compromise if Northern Ireland is to avoid a \u201cspeedy\u201d return to direct rule from London, the head of the Democratic Unionist Party said on Thursday. Irish nationalists Sinn Fein and the DUP have failed to reach agreement on reforming a power-sharing government since a March election and each has blamed the other for missing repeated deadlines. Continued failure would force the British government to bypass the regional assembly and revert to direct rule from London for the first time in a decade, a move that could destabilize the political balance in the province. The British and Irish governments, who are facilitating the talks, have warned that failing to reach an agreement would have \u201cprofound and serious\u201d implications and limit Northern Ireland\u2019s influence in Brexit negotiations, although no one is forecasting a return to serious violence (para. 1-4).

A third round of Brexit talks takes place more than a year after Britons voted in a referendum to leave the European Union, delivering an unprecedented blow to the post-World War Two European integration (para 1-2). Britain will present in detail its several papers released last week on issues ranging from customs arrangements to data sharing. They have often ventured out into the future relationship between London and what will become a 27-state EU (para. 5). The bloc wants to settle chief separation aspects first and has already signaled the slow progress so far means jumpstarting talks about a new accord with Britain is now less likely in October, as had been expected (para. 8). The Irish issue, extremely delicate because of the violent history between the two communities there, is fraught with economic consequences and politically complex (para 12). On money, the EU and Britain seem to be seas apart on agreeing how much London should pay the bloc on departure to account for previous commitments. Sides expect no major leaps forward this week in the talks aimed at unraveling more than 40 years of union (para. 12-14). Baczynska, G. & Blenkinsop, P. (2017).

But the new British proposals for future ties with the EU have been dismissed in Brussels as \u201cfantasy\u201d and no more than an \u201cintra-UK debate\u201d. European officials have suggested that Britain should instead stick to a previously agreed timetable for Brexit negotiations. For Britain, the release over two weeks of a series of strategy and discussion documents was intended to counter criticism that it was unprepared for the talks, and to speed up negotiations that have moved slowly over the past 14 months (para 1-3). INTRA-UK DEBATE\" After pointing to what he saw as lack of clarity on Britain\u2019s future relationship with the European Court of Justice, a European Commission spokesman said: \u201cYou will not be surprised to hear me refraining from injecting myself into an intra-UK debate on their positions\u201d (para 13). He and other EU officials said Brussels\u2019 stance was the same: Britain should first focus on making progress on the three main issues in the initial phase of talks - the rights of expatriates, Britain\u2019s border with EU member state Ireland, and a financial settlement (para 13-14). WARNING The gap in viewpoints in some areas - namely the financial settlement, role of the European court and future trade and customs arrangements - suggests talks next week between Barnier and British Brexit minister David Davis will be difficult and both sides have not set the bar high for progress (para. 21).

A lot of Irish magic will be needed if the proposals set out there are going to have any chance of success. \"Three policies have commanded particular attention. On trade, most exchanges between Northern Ireland and the Republic would be regarded as local, and nothing to do with international rules at all. Except much hair-splitting about what constitutes small and medium-sized business. For the rest, tariff matters and payments would be handled by a whole new, hi-tech system \u2013 the UK\u2019s track record of digital project management does not bode well. \"As for the movement of people, well there would essentially be no need for change. Any risk that the Northern Irish-Republic of Ireland border could become a \u201cback-door\u201d into the UK (or vice versa) would be minimised because the Irish Republic is not \u2013 and would not be \u2013 a member of the Schengen, so the UK and Ireland could keep their own special passport-free regime, while keeping the outer borders secure. \"Except that there are no passport or ID checks between the UK and Ireland, whatever sort of papers you carry. Indeed, the only way, travelling by road, you know you have crossed from the Republic into Northern Ireland is a sign saying that the speed limit is now posted in miles per hour. Any indication that you are crossing into another country is vanishingly discreet. Like it or not, there is a \u201cback door\u201d (which predates both countries\u2019 EU membership). Whether this longstanding \u201cspecial arrangement\u201d can continue after Brexit is another matter. How feasible is a \u201csoft\u201d border between a member and non-member of the EU?\n. . . \nThe position with Northern Ireland is infinitely more difficult [than with Scotland]. And it was made more so because a majority of the Northern Irish voted to remain in the European Union. The margin (56 - 44 per cent) was not as sweeping as in Scotland (62 - 38 per cent), but it was solid. It was also bigger than the margin of victory for Leave in the UK as a whole (52-48), but also in England (53 - 47 per cent). \"One reason why Northern Ireland, despite its unionist majority, voted more like Scotland than England or Wales may be that people on both sides of the sectarian divide saw EU membership as a kind of guarantee for the continuation of the Good Friday agreement that had (mostly) brought peace. Without the EU, the relatively relaxed relations with the Republic, the free movement of people and free trade across the border would all be called into question. \"This is where we are now, with the UK trying desperately to hold on to the gains from EU membership as they relate to Northern Ireland, while preparing to break from the EU in almost every other respect. It is neither a logical nor comfortable position. . . .  \"Happily \u2013 and unhappily \u2013 there is a solution, which is as simple and obvious as it is elusive. The one sure way to enshrine free movement, free trade, and regulatory clarity in relations between the two parts of Ireland is to put them back together. The North would thus remain in the EU \u2013 which is what a majority of those who took part in the referendum voted for \u2013 while the rest of the UK, aka Great Britain, would leave. The only border needed would be the sea. \"How feasible would this be? Alas, despite the pro-EU vote in Northern Ireland, not at all \u2013 at least in the short term. The Northern Ireland parties may be finding it hard to form a new power-sharing government, now that the politicians who made peace have left the scene, and the unionist share of the vote may be declining, but a forced march to unity risks the peace. \"The differences are not to be underestimated. From a distance, it is easy to condemn the recent clashes in the American south as \u201conly\u201d about a monument. But monuments \u2013 and flags \u2013 cannot be dismissed lightly. Over the decades they have sealed Ireland\u2019s division. One person\u2019s patriot is another\u2019s traitor. The two communities remain fenced off from each other in Belfast and (London)Derry; if they find it so hard to share a city, how can they share a country? \"And yet... Is it really beyond the bounds of wise statespeople to devise a solution? Would a clearly federated state not be possible; a state, what is more, with world-class guarantees for the rights of what would become the Protestant minority? Is the fear that would precipitate a resort to arms really still there? \"Since the Brexit vote, the unity question has been very quietly, very tentatively, reopened, after 10 years in which the Good Friday Agreement had pronounced it closed. But a twist of fate \u2013 the Conservatives\u2019 need for the DUP\u2019s parliamentary votes \u2013 at once enhanced the status of the DUP in Northern Ireland and regrettably put any new thinking on hold. \"But such an obvious remedy to the Brexit-Northern Ireland conundrum cannot remain off limits for ever. Demographic change in the North is already affecting elections there. Socially and economically, the Republic is a very different country from the one it was before it joined the EU. Arguably, the country that has changed least, in its institutional attitudes, is the UK. \"If only it could fully accept the Republic of Ireland as an independent sovereign state, with no need for colonial-era privileges such as passport-free travel and votes in UK elections. If only it chose to halt the generous protection that stunts Northern Ireland\u2019s development and allows a loyalist minority to live in the past. If the UK made moves in this direction, some of the biggest stumbling blocks in the Brexit negotiations would melt away \u2013 with the bonus of normalised relations between Great Britain and Ireland \u2013 even if, in the end, we decided not to leave.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  I do not see a referendum being called prior to the actual Brexit.

The European Union has floated a figure of 60 billion euros and wants significant progress on settling Britain's liabilities before talks can start on complex issues such as future trading arrangements. The government department responsible for Brexit talks declined to comment on the Sunday Telegraph article. So far, Britain has given no official indication of how much it would be willing to pay. The newspaper said British officials were likely to offer to pay 10 billion euros a year for three years after leaving the EU in March 2019, then finalize the total alongside detailed trade talks. Payments would only be made as part of a deal that included a trade agreement, the newspaper added. \"We know (the EU's) position is 60 billion euros, but the actual bottom line is 50 billion euros. Ours is closer to 30 billion euros but the actual landing zone is 40 billion euros, even if the public and politicians are not all there yet,\" the newspaper quoted one \"senior Whitehall source\" as saying (para 1-6).

The uncertainty coincided with the EU's top negotiator warning that formal talks are set to be delayed, eating up more of the two-year divorce timetable. Negotiations on the future relationship between Britain and the EU are now less likely to start in October because of a lack of progress at the initial stage of talks about the breakup, Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has told EU ambassadors. Britain responded that it was confident that enough progress could be made to start the second stage of talks but as Prime Minister Theresa May holidayed in Italy, her ministers engaged in a public debate about how Brexit should look (para. 1-4). Brexit Transition Hammond's tone, meanwhile, is sharply different that of some other senior ministers in May's cabinet who want a cleaner break with the EU including swift controls on immigration (para. 14). \"A transitional deal will delay all the benefits of being able to control our laws, trade and borders. We need to get on with it,\" said Richard Tice, a Brexiteer who helped fund one of the Leave campaigns in the EU referendum (para. 14-15).

The border between the Irish Republic, a member of the European Union, and the British province of Northern Ireland will be the only land frontier between the United Kingdom and the EU once Britain leaves the bloc in early 2019. Politicians in London, Dublin, Belfast and Brussels have all said they want to avoid the return of a \"hard border\" but Ian Paisley Jr of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) warned of exactly that when he reacted strongly to a report that Dublin wanted the Irish Sea to effectively be the post-Brexit border. \"1 of 2 things will now happen 1. A very hard border 2. Ireland will wise up and leave the EU,\" Paisley Jr, a member of the British parliament, said on Twitter, linking to the report in the Times newspaper. The report said the Irish government's preferred option for customs and immigration checks to be located away from the land border and at ports and airports instead would effectively draw a new border in the Irish sea. Officials from the Irish government agency responsible for customs checks said in May that such checks 10-15 kilometers from the frontier were being considered and then Irish finance minister Michael Noonan raised the possibility of control points at airports and ports over a year ago. Such a scenario would be unacceptable to the eurosceptic DUP which was the only major Northern Irish party to campaign for Brexit and which wants to boost the union with Britain in the face of calls by Northern Irish nationalists to unite both sides of the Irish border (para 1-7).

U.K. Brexit Secretary David Davis and the EU\u2019s top negotiator Michel Barnier returned to the negotiating table in Brussels for the first time since the official opening of talks on June 19, with the focus on U.K. and EU citizens\u2019 rights after Brexit and how much London must pay to cover the U.K.\u2019s outstanding financial commitments to the bloc. The two sides also are due to discuss how to manage the U.K.\u2019s border with Ireland after withdrawal, expected in March 2019. The EU has insisted progress must be made on these and other separation issues before it will consider discussing future economic ties to the U.K., highlighting the challenge of agreeing a far-reaching settlement on Brexit within the 18 months remaining for talks (para. 1-4). Despite such differences, analysts say that the two sides should be able to reach a deal on citizens\u2019 rights, but a much bigger disagreement looms over money (para. 8). The EU estimates the U.K. is on the hook for upward of \u20ac60 billion euros ($69 billion) in spending pledges made but not yet fulfilled. The prospect of payment on such a scale is political dynamite in the U.K., where advocates of Brexit won last year\u2019s referendum in part on a promise to stop sending Brussels any money at all. Boris Johnson, U.K. foreign secretary, last week dismissed such demands as \u201cextortionate\u201d and agreed with a colleague in Parliament that the EU could \u201cgo whistle\u201d for such a sum.

The economic impact of a \"cliff-edge\" Brexit, alongside the failure of the Conservatives to win a majority in the general election, should lead to a rethink of the position that \"no deal is better than a bad deal\", Sky News reported, citing at least 30 Conservative lawmakers. Sky quoted a former minister saying \"no deal is now dead\", and anticipating a transition phase of five to 10 years inside the European Economic Area. May is eight seats short of a majority in Britain's parliament amid increasingly evident cracks in her own party just as crucial Brexit negotiations get under way. She sets out her policy plans in parliament on Wednesday without an arrangement giving her government enough support to pass legislation. She needs the support of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which is expected to use its 10 votes to back her in exchange for a series of agreements (para. 1-5).

Kenny will ask the other 26 leaders meeting in Brussels to endorse a negotiating plan for Britain's withdrawal to give a political endorsement to what Irish and EU legal experts say is the position in international law of such territorial changes. \"It would merely state the obvious, i.e. that also a united Ireland would continue being a member of the EU,\" a source close to preparations for the European Council said. \"The EU does of course not take a stance on the possibility of a united Ireland.

The demands are contained in a paper, seen by Reuters on Thursday, that outlines \"key elements\" of directives for Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, who will launch talks on a Brexit treaty after Britain holds a general election on June 8. Prime Minister Theresa May has put ending \"free movement\" of workers from other EU states, budget contributions to Brussels and oversight by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) among central planks of her plans for leaving the European Union, due to happen in March 2019 after a two-year negotiating period. But in language that echoes a tough line taken by the 27 other EU leaders who will endorse a common position at a summit on April 29, the paper spells out Brussels' aim to protect the rights of 3 million EU citizens living in Britain, extract cash from London to cover a wide range of existing commitments and ensure EU judges can hold Britain to the treaty after Brexit. It does not put a figure on what Britain might owe -- May's ministers dismiss an estimate of 60 billion euros ($64 billion) floated by the EU -- but said the exit treaty should both set a \"global amount\" to honor financial obligations, subject to later adjustments. It will be fixed in euros, not pounds. And there would also be \"a schedule of annual payments\". That would reflect the fact that loans and guarantees made by the EU while Britain is a member extend well beyond 2019. During this transition period, rules would be enforced by the ECJ, the paper states, in one of numerous references to the Luxembourg judges' continuing role in Britain. It said the EU might consider an \"alternative dispute settlement\" system for the treaty, but only if that was \"equivalent\" to the ECJ.

New elections would leave the British province without a government for two more months during Britain's crucial talks to exit the European Union, and would give Sinn Fein a chance to become the largest party in Northern Ireland for the first time. \"The legislation is very clear: if there isn't an agreement we need to go to an election,\" said Conor Murphy, speaking to journalists on behalf of Sinn Fein's negotiating team. Northern Ireland has been in a political crisis since Sinn Fein pulled out of government in January, sparking a March 2 election that ended the majority which the pro-British unionists had enjoyed in the province for almost a century. Sinn Fein shocked many observers by getting very close to becoming the largest party in what would be a dramatic transformation of the province's politics.

While approximately 55% of Northern Irish voted to stay in the EU, a September 2016 Ipsos MORI poll, 63% of Northern Irish indicated they would vote to remain a part of the UK if a border referendum vote were held. This poll was held between August and September 2016, over a month after the referendum vote to leave the EU (Brexit). While the Nationalists have made recent gains, and there are indications of an increasing sense of nationalism, there have not been sufficient indications that Sinn Fein can rally enough votes to for a successful referendum. While a date for a referendum could be announced without this support, it could potentially be a politically fraught decision for the Nationalists, with failure bolstering the support of the Unionists. Instead, they are likely to continue calling for a referendum \"as soon as possible,\" while allowing time to observe the effects of Britain's Article 50 process and to continue building support for independence. With all that, the possibility exists that Northern Ireland could announce a date for a referendum before July 1, 2018. If the 2014 Scottish independence referendum serves as an example, it would take several months after the elections (about 8, in Scotland's case) to organize sufficiently to announce a date, followed by several years of preparation work before the actual referendum. And in the Scottish case, the Scottish National Party had won a majority of Parliament seats, thus gaining a mandate to hold the referendum. Sinn Fein does not have a mandate, even after the gains in the most recent election, and the next election is not scheduled until 2022. The July 1, 2018 date may be met if nationalist sentiment grows in the next several months, but based on the most recent, post-Brexit polling data, there is not sufficient interest by Northern Irish to leave the UK at this point.
