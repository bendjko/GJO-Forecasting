It is only designed to make the driving experience easier.  This is far from full autonomy.  Tesla autopilot cars have to first safely navigate within and around other traffic first before they can focus attention on navigating traffic lights- and this goes beyond merely stopping at them.  Musk himself in an April 2019 interview estimated that by the middle of 2020, Tesla\u2019s autonomous system will have improved to the point where drivers will not have to pay attention to the road.  At this investors event, Musk made a series of bold predictions today about the ability for his company\u2019s cars to completely drive themselves- and Musk thinks it will happen sooner than most of his competitors \u2014 perhaps as soon as the end of this year.  A release can mean many things- and in the context of this forecast, it is assessed by the forecaster that \"release\" means available to the general public.  https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/22/18510828/tesla-elon-musk-autonomy-day-investor-comments-self-driving-cars-predictions.

If that is not enough, just this year, Musk admitted mistakes caused Tesla's Model 3 production delays.   http://fortune.com/2018/06/05/tesla-elon-musk-model-3-production-delay/.  Ironic he stated, \u201cOne of the biggest mistakes we made was trying to automate things that are super easy for a person to do, but really hard for a robot to do,\u201d Musk said.  Remember, Musk is known for\u00a0setting ambitious goals and timelines\u00a0for the electric car company, but he isn\u2019t known for hitting them.\u00a0 Plus a recent partnership between SpaceX and NASA is going to divert development attention and resources from the navigable autopilot features. https://www.nasa.gov/spacex.  A goal\u2019s emphasis is on the definite objective while ambition can also refer to the level of determination that is applied for the pursuit of the goal.

The feature is as it sounds: divers using the Autosteer feature will get a warning if they\u2019re about to run a stop light. The company says that the new safety feature is designed to help improve safe driving around stop lights, and is rolling out in a new software update, 2019.8.3. The notification pops up for drivers that are using Autosteer, and if they\u2019re driving fast enough that they might run a red light. The feature won\u2019t apply the car\u2019s brakes, but it will provide a visual and audible signal that lets the driver know that they need to resume control of the car and slow down right away.\" [1] \n- \"A Tesla hacker found a new Autopilot feature dormant in Tesla\u2019s 2019.8.3 software update that allows the car to autonomously stop at red lights.\" [2] Evidence that it won't stop at recognition. \"Tesla has begun producing Model X and Model S vehicles with the latest Autopilot hardware to support Full Self-Driving capabilities. Dubbed \u201cHW3\u201d, the new hardware is Tesla\u2019s next iteration of its semi-autonomous driving-assist feature that includes Navigate on Autopilot, Advanced Summon, Auto Lane Change, Autopark, and the ability to respond to traffic lights.\" [3] The question remains whether the ability to stop at red lights is already sufficient for the question to resolve positively. I'd estimate 90% for that.\nI'm also not sure what the above implies about timelines. My best guess is 80% that the feature will be rolled out before the end of the year.

Tesla is unique from a training data standpoint, where drivers taking control over from Autopilot indicates a failure of some sort that has to be addressed.  It's a question of whether he'll launch it this year. I think he has to put it out there in order to get better data to further train the Autopilot system.

Despite the hefty price tag of Model 3, X, and S cars, one of the most distinguishing features of Tesla models is the autopilot feature. At this point in time, the autopilot feature is intended solely for highway trips where a driver would not encounter traffic lights, stops or roundabouts. The company plans to expand this feature to be fully self driving capable. On December 9, 2018 Elon Musk tweeted \"Already testing traffic lights, stop signs & roundabouts in development software. Your Tesla will soon be able to go from your garage at home to parking at work with no driver input at all.\" The company announced that these updates will be implemented \"soon\".  I have predicted a 5%  probability that Tesla will release an Autopilot feature designed to navigate traffic lights due to the difficulty of traffic light navigation and the time it takes to surpass legal issues regarding self-driving cars. I have no doubt that Tesla will eventually release a full Autopilot feature; however, it is highly unlikely they will do it by January 2020. Simply from Musk's tweet, it seems as though they are in the very beginning stages of the process and completion in under a year seems improbable.
