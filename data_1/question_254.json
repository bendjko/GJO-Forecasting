It predicts around 62 per cent of the registered supporters who paid \u00a325 for a vote last month will back the Labour leader's rival, Owen Smith.\nIt also believes he has the support of 60 per cent of members who joined before the 2015 general election. \"However, Corbyn is said to have the backing of two-thirds of the 150,000 people who joined the party between May 2015 and January 2016. \"Nevertheless, Saving Labour says Smith has a slim majority of trade union-affiliated members \u2013 and ultimately could edge the race by around 4,000 votes. \"The analysis will come as a surprise to many, who have seen Mr Corbyn attract huge crowds across the country in recent weeks,\" says the Daily Mirror.\n. . . \n\"Saving Labour's numbers are plausible - but they feel unlikely,\" says Stephen Bush at the New Statesman. He points out Smith would need \"big wins among trade unionists and registered supporters, both of which went for Corbyn by large margins last time\".\nHowever, he concedes that if \"last year\u2019s \u00a33ers were drawn from 'Old Labour in exile', it is possible this year's \u00a325ers are 'New Labour in exile'\".\n. . . \n\"The deadline for voters to choose between current leader Jeremy Corbyn and former work and pensions secretary Owen Smith is 21 September, with the winner announced three days later.   \"In recent days, a number of senior Labour politicians \u2013 including Scottish Labour Party leader Kezia Dugdale and London Mayor Sadiq Kahn \u2013 have come out in support of Smith, arguing that a party led by Corbyn would have no chance of winning the next general election. \"Most commentators \u2013 and bookies \u2013 predict Corbyn will be announced the winner at a special conference in Liverpool next month. \"Few believe Corbyn's soft-left challenger will prevail,\" says the New Statesmen."], [24242, "2016-08-30T18:19:18Z", [0.15, 0.85, 0.0], ""], [11858, "2016-08-30T13:26:52Z", [0.7, 0.3, 0.0], "There really has been no polling of Labour's \"selectorate\" since the race began in earnest.

Betfair give Smith a 12% of winning; Corbyn has gained 285 constituency party nominations, while Smith is on just 53.

I don\u2019t know a constituency... being polled where Corbyn is in front. At best he\u2019s neck and neck or Smith has a 20% lead.\u201d \u201cThere is a lot of switching from Jeremy to Owen.

Brighton is a traditionally left wing stronghold, which might be expected to strongly favour Corbyn. But, Jackson says, \u201cit has got relatively close between Jeremy and Owen recently\u201d. \u201cThere is a not insignificant group who voted for Jeremy last time and are not planning to vote for him this time. I think it is certainly not going to be a complete landslide.\u201d \"People are changing sides, he says, because \u201cthey like Jeremy\u2019s politics but in the last ten or eleven months in terms of practical leadership, they think he has not done well. The second broad theme is dissatisfaction from people on the EU referendum and the campaign for that\u201d. \"According to Bradshaw, the most common reason given by Labour members in Exeter who favour Smith is \u201celectability\u201d. \u201cThe second is unity. Those two things are connected. The third, quite a way behind, is Brexit\u201d, he says.  \"Corbyn\u2019s office remains confident of victory, and private polling has proved unreliable in the past. But Labour MPs argue that this time their research is based on a wider sample of Labour members than other polls. \u201cI completely accept that these findings might be exceptional - but it\u2019s quite a high level of sampling\u201d, says Bradshaw. \u201cI predicted previous Labour leaderships correctly based on my canvassing.\u201d \"Jones reckons Smith supporters have only emerged in recent days. \u201cThe hard to contacts are solid Smith and the easy to contacts are solid Corbyn\u201d, he says.  \"Saving Labour, a pro-Smith group, recently said it has recruited 70,000 of 140,000 of Labour\u2019s registered supporters, who, it says, are likely to vote for Smith.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENTS:  \nThe averages of the 8 polls from specific constituencies cited in this article are:  Smith 52%, Corbyn 36%, undecided 12%.

(a) New membership. being strongly pro-Corbyn  (And the current dispute over voting rights of members who joined in the previous six months may not have major impact here, as this applies to those who joined in the second half of 2015 as much as in the first half of 2016)  The various sects around him - notably those which operate under the name \"Momentum\" (legal name of one section: \"Jeremy for Labour\") have enthused many formerly \"non-political\" (or inactive far-left, or former Greens) to join the Labour Party, specifically to endorse what are regarded as Corbyn's worldview. The vast increase in party membership over the past year has been largely of these people - and it is largely true that such far-left viewpoints have largely lacked parliamentary representation in UK. It is highly probable that the expansion in Labour Party membership in the past year or so has been in large measure out of support for Corbyn, One anecdotal example of this (in one seat in which Labour increased their share of the vote, at the expense of the Greens) is this email, from the time of last year's leadership contest, from what was then my local farmers' market (in a constituency entirely unrepresentative of the UK populace overall, but fairly representative of those supporting Corbyn) :  \" The origins of democracy can be seen in the markets (agoras) of Greece and\nlater the forums of Rome. We believe our market has a social function beyond food and consumption. As such, you will find a stall from *'Oxford for Corbyn*' at this week's market promoting Jeremy Corbyn MP's campaign\nfor leader of the Labour Party, which has sparked such tremendous debate across the country. Whilst we believe our market itself should remain apolitical, we are excited to make room for politics, discussions and\ncampaigns.\".  (Needless to say, no stalls for any other leadership contenders' manifested themselves) 2. Constituency Labour Party votes.\nThe recent elections to Labour's National Executive Committee were a triumph for those allied to Corbyn http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/08/labour-must-allow-all-members-leadership-vote-court-rules  \"Results of the NEC elections showed that the six members elected to represent constituency Labour parties were Corbyn backers, while his critics, including current member Johanna Baxter, who recently complained about bullying in the party, and the comedian Eddie Izzard lost out.\" Moreover, the number of constituency parties backing Corbyn is far greater than those backing Smith.\nhttp://labourlist.org/2016/07/which-constituencies-have-had-confidence-votes-in-jeremy-corbyns-leadership/\n(This is purely symbolic, as the voting comprises individual members, but may also be indicative of the mood within the party).   But even in his native Wales only one constituency party has backed Smith.... 3). Owen Smith. He is an obscure figure (even more obscure than Corbyn was in his 32 years as a backbencher),  - almost completely unknown with the wider public, and even much of the paarty membership, but,  more importantly, has little substantive to distinguish himself from Corbyn. His policy proposals seem to be being laid out on a pitch that Corbyn has laid out - firmly to the (far) left, albeit with less overt or evident connections to extremists or policies that the general populace might be expected to regard as absurd (eg quasi-pacifism.)
