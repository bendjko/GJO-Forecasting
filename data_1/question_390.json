The South China Sea has long been the most, thorny issue for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), with different opinions among its 10 members on how to address China's assertiveness and its building and heavy arming of its artificial islands in disputed waters. Philippine foreign ministry spokesman Robespierre Bolivar gave no reason for the delay and said the statement would instead be released at the end of a series of regional events hosted by Manila in the next few days. \"The communique will be issued together with all the chairman's statements by the end of all the meetings,\" he said. ASEAN's problem in agreeing the wording highlight China's growing influence at a time of uncertainty whether the new U.S. administration will priorities relations with ASEAN, and try to check Beijing's controversial maritime activities. Diplomats from three ASEAN countries said the delay was because Vietnam, which is among four members with competing sovereignty claims with China, wanted the text to mention the need to avoid land reclamation and militarization (para. 1-6). China is extremely sensitive about ASEAN mentioning its expansion of its military capabilities on those islands and some members are concerned about possible repercussions of upsetting Beijing given its military and economic power (para.8). Three of China's seven reclaimed reefs have runways several kilometers\u2019 long, radar, surface-to-air missiles and storage facilities for fighter jets. \"It's only Vietnam holding out. Maybe, by tomorrow everything will be ironed out,\" said one diplomat involved in the drafting process (para. 8-10). Mogato, M. (2017).

Beijing is also increasingly positioning itself as a global free trade champion. \"If we can successfully conclude these negotiations quickly, it will be an important statement in favor of free trade and economic integration,\" Singapore's Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan told reporters in Beijing after meeting with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi. \"At this point in time, it is more necessary than ever before,\" he said.

Chinese President Xi Jinping is hosting dozens of world leaders and senior officials on Sunday for the country's biggest diplomatic showcase of the year, touting his vision of a new \"Silk Road\" that opens trade routes across the globe. Government officials from New Delhi did not travel, Indian officials said, although scholars from Indian think-tanks have flown to Beijing to attend some of the meetings at the forum. Indian foreign ministry spokesman Gopal Baglay, asked whether New Delhi was participating in the summit, said India could not accept a project that compromised its sovereignty. India is incensed that one of the key Belt and Road projects passes through Kashmir and Pakistan. The nuclear-armed rivals have fought two of their three wars over the disputed region. \"No country can accept a project that ignores its core concerns on sovereignty and territorial integrity,\" Baglay said. He also warned of the danger of debt. One of the criticisms of the Silk Road plan is that host countries may struggle to pay back loans for huge infrastructure projects being carried out and funded by Chinese companies and banks. \"Connectivity initiatives must follow principles of financial responsibility to avoid projects that would create unsustainable debt burden for communities,\" Baglay said. New Delhi's criticism of the Belt and Road initiative came as Xi pledged $124 billion to the plan, and called for the abandonment of old models based on rivalry and diplomatic power games (para. 1-8).

The debt binge is spread across companies, banks, governments and households and is inflating bubbles in everything from the price of steel rebar in Shanghai to property prices in Sydney. As the Federal Reserve raises borrowing costs, that means debt is again a concern. Exposure to China\u2019s slowdown, fluctuating commodity prices and currency volatility are just some of the risks. S&P Global Ratings estimates that of the almost $1 trillion in Asia corporate debt they rate that is due to mature by 2021, 63 percent of it is denominated in dollars and 7 percent in euros. To be sure, there are sizable buffers too. Governments have strengthened their international reserves, hedging of risks has improved and deeper local bond markets offer alternative sources of finance. And while the Fed is tightening, ongoing massive monetary easing in Europe and Japan provides an offset. Interest rates remain low by historical standards and reflation is helping bring down servicing costs. Still, the pace of borrowing is eye watering. A debt hangover in Asia matters because the region is the biggest contributor to global growth. Asia\u2019s expansion will probably exceed 5 percent in 2017 and 2018, compared with about 3.5 percent for the world, according to the International Monetary Fund (para. 1-5). Bloomberg News.

However, negotiations between the partners are far from complete, members are still distrustful of others, and different levels of economic development of countries are getting in the way of settling implementation schedules.

India has a huge trade deficit with China which it does not want to increase any further.

From the perspective of the ASEAN countries (the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia, Singapore, Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam), this U.S. economic disengagement from Asia is a leading indicator of a shift in American grand strategy away from an expansive, multi-faceted approach involving economic, political and military dimensions to one that is more narrowly focused on a military security strategy aimed at establishing a virtually impregnable defensive line (in a conventional military sense) in the Western Pacific running from Japan through Guam to Australia. Beijing\u2019s challenge will be how to take advantage of this window of opportunity to consolidate peacefully its embryonic 21st-century version of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Far from being a threat, the current incarnation of \u201cAmerica First\u201d may well be a boon to Beijing. Strategic Importance of ASEAN Neutrality A key element of the Middle Kingdom\u2019s grand strategy is to foster the neutrality of southeast Asian states in the event of serious conflict between Beijing and Washington. Ultimately, ASEAN neutrality means that no member country would host military facilities for the regular use of outside powers. From Beijing\u2019s national security viewpoint, southeast Asia is critical for two reasons. First, many of the countries\u2014most importantly the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Indonesia\u2014have overlapping and competing maritime claims in the South China Sea that could significantly impede China\u2019s efforts to establish a maritime cordon sanitaire beyond the customary 12-nautical-mile line along its eastern seaboard. Second, the countries sharing common land borders with China (Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam) serve as a buffer protecting China\u2019s vulnerable southeastern underbelly. Clearly, Beijing would prefer that its southeast Asian neighbors are not hostile and avoid policies that could adversely impact China\u2019s vital national security interests. To further this objective, Beijing has embraced an approach using the persuasive allure of soft power\u2014economic, financial and cultural incentives and inducements, with occasional demonstrations of coercive power, military actions and rhetorical saber rattling, to dissuade ASEAN member countries from banding together (and cooperating with the U.S.) to counterbalance China, and to encourage them to remain neutral in any larger struggle between Beijing and Washington over East Asian dominance. China\u2019s economic power provides the gravitational pull to keep the ASEAN countries within its sphere of influence. China is the economic engine of Asia, having displaced both the United States and Japan as the most important trading partner of the ASEAN countries. China is the single-largest provider of bilateral economic development aid to them. In addition, China is sponsoring multilateral institutions (from which the U.S. is conspicuously absent) such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), New Development Bank (NDB or BRICS Bank) and the BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement (BRICS CRA) to further reinforce and identify its central role in funding Asian economic development. The collapse of the American-sponsored TPP trade initiative due to the withdrawal of U.S. support provides a clear path for Beijing to assume the mantle of leadership and promote the Comprehensive Regional Economic Partnership (CREP), the regional trade alternative originally proposed by ASEAN and enthusiastically backed by China. Of course, there is an important cultural dimension that potentially enhances Beijing\u2019s economic soft power, as there are significant minority-ethnic Chinese communities with deep local roots and prominent commercial roles in each of the southeast Asian countries (with ethnic Chinese constituting the majority population of Singapore) (para. 1-3).

RCEP negotiations were formally launched in November 2012 at the ASEAN Summit in Cambodia. RCEP is viewed as an alternative to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement, which excludes China and India and includes several nations of the Americas. 2. The withdrawal of the US from the TPP has improved the chance of success for RCEP.  In withdrawing, the United States has left China in the driver\u2019s seat on Asia trade agreements. China is now leading the push for the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which excludes the United States but includes all the important Asian economies as well as Australia and New Zealand. In a memo written upon his departure as Obama\u2019s U.S. Trade Representative, Michael Froman warned that jettisoning the TPP \u201cwill be our loss and China\u2019s gain\u201d as the 16-country RCEP \u201cwould not protect labor and the environment, would not ensure Internet freedom, would not protect patents or trademarks or copyright from infringement, counterfeiting, and piracy, and would impose no disciplines on state-owned enterprises.\u201d 3.  The RCEP takes into account the East Asia Free Trade Agreement (EAFTA) and the Comprehensive Economic Partnership in East Asia (CEPEA) initiatives, with the difference that the RCEP is not working on a pre-determined membership. Instead, it is based on open accession which enables participation of any of the ASEAN FTA partners (China, Korea, Japan, India and Australia-New Zealand) at the outset or later when they are ready to join. The arrangement is also open to any other external economic partners, such as nations in Central Asia and remaining nations in South Asia and Oceania.\n4.  The RCEP seeks to achieve a modern and comprehensive trade agreement among members. The core of the negotiating agenda would cover trade in goods and services, investment, economic and technical cooperation and dispute settlement. The partnership would be a powerful vehicle to support the spread of global production networks and reduce the inefficiencies of multiple Asian trade agreements that exist presently.\n5.  Realizing these benefits depends on addressing several challenges during the negotiation phase. The first would be overcoming risks, arising from negotiating partners with different levels of development and varying interests. There is a flexibility clause built into the RCEP framework, worded as follows: \u201cRCEP will include appropriate forms of flexibility including provision for special and differential treatment, plus additional flexibility to the least-developed ASEAN Member States.\u201d This flexibility clause could help break deadlocks and protect national interests, but could also limit, change or curtail progress in achieving greater liberalization. By killing the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) without an alternative plan or vision, Trump has left our Asian allies twisting in the wind, with little choice but to sign on to the Chinese value proposition of providing money, infrastructure, and market access in return for settling in under China\u2019s economic and security umbrella.\nhttp://foreignpolicy.com/2017/02/03/towards-a-trump-pacific-partnership-a-way-forward-to-win-on-trade-with-china/\nIn his keynote speech, Xi warned that \u201cno one will emerge as a winner in a trade war\u201d and that the world\u2019s leaders must \u201csay no to protectionism.\u201d ______________________________________\nCOMMENTS: Beijing has been seriously outmaneuvering Washington for years; by withdrawing from the TPP, Trump is enhancing the chances of success of the RCEP. Unlike Trump\u2019s, Chinese retaliation is not a 6:00 a.m. Twitter tantrum but a well-studied and carefully targeted response that will deliver maximum punishment. Criticism: RCEP has been criticized by free culture activists for containing \"quite simply the worst provisions on copyright that [...] ever seen in a trade agreement.\n\"RCEP contains no requirement for countries to extend the copyright term beyond the minimum specified in the Berne Convention, which is usually the life of the author plus 50 years. This means that for countries that have not already extended their copyright term\u2014and have not signed and ratified the TPP\u2014RCEP would allow them to maintain their existing copyright term.\"\nFrankly, it is a little poor as criticism."], [29680, "2017-02-08T09:43:47Z", [0.45], "Persuaded by https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/439662 and consensus.
