This question will largely depend on the person judging the answer however.    The Saudi's have instituted a naval and air blockade, and yet simultaneously are the ones in charge of humanitarian relief efforts.   Deaths from famine, and the raging diptheria and cholera epidemics should squarely be counted as targetted killings of civilians.    Additionally, the Saudis have used indiscriminate bombing in civilian areas.  Some might defend this as less advanced armies do not have the expertise to conduct precision strikes, and there is some truth to that.   However, it is also true that the Houthis as well as other islamist groups have infiltrated civilian areas and the Saudis' have chosen to target those areas.   Under the rules of this challenge this seems to qualify as separate campaigns, but it should not.  Famine is just airstrikes by other means. Saleh's switching sides (and subsequent death) should have lessened financial support for the Houthi's.  Nonetheless there has been no significant progress in resolution of the war.  Iran will continue to view this as a valuable way to drain saudi dollars, with very good leverage for minimal investment.  Additionally, the Houthis themselves have a chance of hitting the 1000 mark with their campaign of firing on residetial areas in Taiz, and via their use of snipers. Infrastructure continues to degrade The Saudis are facing regional pressure from Iran; and seek to reinstall Hadi to power.   With oil prices stabilizing, and reforms to the economy, there is no immediate pressure for Saudi's to moderate their behavior. So: 20%, there is a significant chance of a national reconciliation.  The Houthi's have entered into negotionas and accepted them several times over the last few years.   8% chance the Houthi's collapse  there will be an immediate increase in fatalities as these areas are over run.  There is a roughly 5% chance that the Saud's recognize this fight is not worth the cost, (and/or have a coup) and change the terms of their engagement.  This equates to a 75% chance that the status quo or worse continues. 70% chance that fatalities administered by one side or the other will be counted as \"one campaign\"  .7 *.7 +.08, rounding down = 55% chance.
