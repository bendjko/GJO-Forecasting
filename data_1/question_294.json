At a meeting in Saint Petersburg between the Russian and Turkish presidents, an opportunistic convergence of minds could emerge between the two leaders. Pierini (2017) May 10, states that: In the wake of the failed putsch in Turkey on July 15 and the ensuing perplexities in Western military circles, questions have been asked about Ankara\u2019s reliability in NATO and in the coalition against the self-proclaimed Islamic State. My question today is different: Will Russia\u2019s long game of undermining the EU\u2019s cohesion, the U.S. status as the major superpower, or the role of NATO find fertile ground in post-coup Turkey? One hypothesis is that Russia may go for a long-term game-changing move and lure Turkey away from the West as part of a broader geopolitical reconfiguration. In Turkey, the state and the people are in shock, the army is being reorganized, and a wide-ranging purge is ongoing. Anti-Western sentiments are on the rise among a number of politicians and a large segment of the population. There is unease at the thought that Western powers are evaluating the coup\u2019s potential damage to NATO\u2019s second-largest conventional army, the possible consequences for the defense of Europe, and the implications for operations of the anti\u2013Islamic State coalition. Russia, for its part, has a long-standing policy of challenging NATO, the United States, and the EU, for example through the harassment of NATO\u2019s defenses around Europe or through its good relations with the most vocal anti-EU forces on European soil in, say, France, Hungary, or the UK. Similarly, the Russian military intervention in Syria that began in September 2015 illustrated a willingness to counter Western influence in the Middle East in addition to rescuing the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Against this complex background, the presidents of Russia and Turkey will meet in Saint Petersburg on August 9. Their first objective will be to close the dispute triggered by the downing of a Russian aircraft over Turkish territory in November 2015. Exports, construction contracts, and tourism have been badly affected by the resulting Russian sanctions, so reconciliation will bring welcome economic benefits to Turkey. Also, Russia\u2014already a major partner of Turkey in the energy sector, providing 58 percent of Turkey\u2019s gas consumption and building a nuclear power plant\u2014could resume work on the suspended Turkish Stream pipeline across the Black Sea, which would boost Turkey\u2019s hub as a gas supplier to Europe (para.1-5).

Mattis expressed optimism that Washington and Ankara would work through tensions after a half-hour discussion with Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim in London, which he described as \"honest, transparent and helpful.\" It was the highest-level talks between the two nations since Washington on Tuesday announced plans to back the YPG militia in an assault to retake the city of Raqqa from Islamic State. NATO ally Turkey views the YPG as the Syrian extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has fought an insurgency in southeast Turkey since 1984 and is considered a terrorist group by the United States, Turkey and Europe. \"We agree 100 percent with Turkey's concern about PKK ... and we support Turkey in its fight against PKK as a fellow NATO member,\" Mattis said. A U.S. official told Reuters that the United States was looking to boost intelligence cooperation with Turkey to support its fight against the PKK. The Wall Street Journal reported the effort could end up doubling the capacity of an intelligence sharing center in Ankara. It was unclear if the effort would be enough to soothe Turkey, however. Turkey has warned the United States that its decision to arm Kurdish forces fighting Islamic State in Syria could end up hurting Washington, and accused its NATO ally of siding with terrorists.

Gen. Mike Flynn, while serving as an adviser to the Trump campaign, met with top Turkish government ministers and discussed removing a Muslim cleric from the U.S. and taking him to Turkey, according to former Central Intelligence Agency Director James Woolsey, who attended, and others who were briefed on the meeting. The discussion late last summer involved ideas about how to get Fethullah Gulen, a cleric whom Turkey has accused of orchestrating last summer\u2019s failed military coup, to Turkey without going through the U.S. extradition legal process, according to Mr. Woolsey and those who were briefed. Mr. Woolsey told The Wall Street Journal he arrived at the meeting in New York on Sept. 19 in the middle of the discussion and found the topic startling and the actions being discussed possibly illegal. The Turkish ministers were interested in open-ended thinking on the subject, and the ideas were raised hypothetically, said the people who were briefed. The ministers in attendance included the son-in-law of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the country\u2019s foreign minister, foreign-lobbying disclosure documents show. Mr. Woolsey said the idea was \u201ca covert step in the dead of night to whisk this guy away.\u201d The discussion, he said, didn\u2019t include actual tactics for removing Mr. Gulen from his U.S. home. If specific plans had been discussed, Mr. Woolsey said, he would have spoken up and questioned their legality. It isn\u2019t known who raised the idea or what Mr. Flynn concluded about it. Price Floyd, a spokesman for Mr. Flynn, who was advising the Trump campaign on national security at the time of the meeting, disputed the account, saying \u201cat no time did Gen. Flynn discuss any illegal actions, non-judicial physical removal or any other such activities.\u201d Mr. Flynn served as President Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser for 24 days and resigned after he misled Vice President Mike Pence and others about his contact with a Russian diplomat. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is looking into whether Trump campaign officials collaborated with the Russian government to influence the presidential election. On March 2, weeks after Mr. Flynn\u2019s departure from the Trump administration, the Flynn Intel Group, his consulting firm, filed with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for the government of Turkey. Mr. Trump was unaware Mr. Flynn had been consulting on behalf of the Turkish government when he named him national security adviser, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said this month. In its filing, Mr. Flynn\u2019s firm said its work from August to November \u201ccould be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.\u201d The filing said his firm\u2019s fee, $530,000, wasn\u2019t paid by the government but by Inovo BV, a Dutch firm owned by a Turkish businessman, Ekim Alptekin.\nU.S.-Turkish relations deteriorated in the final year of the Obama administration over disagreements about extraditing Mr. Gulen and U.S. support for Syrian Kurdish forces battling Islamic State.

The bloc is divided between eastern European and Baltic Sea countries that see a new pipeline carrying Russian gas across the Baltic making the EU a hostage to Moscow - and those in northern Europe, most especially the main beneficiary Germany, for whom the economic benefits take priority. The result, EU sources say, is that the EU executive, the Commission, sensing that there may ultimately be no legal basis to block approval of Nord Stream 2, is delaying it as long as possible, hoping to get past 2019 - the date when Russia must renegotiate a gas transit deal with Ukraine. \"There's a difference between not supporting the project and having a legal basis to stop it,\" said one EU diplomat, adding that the aim for now was \"a break to avoid the project going anywhere in 2019\". And for now, that means doing nothing, to the intense frustration of members such as Denmark, whose prime minister challenged the Commission at a summit of EU leaders this month to make good on strong words criticizing the pipeline. Last summer, seven eastern member states, all formerly dominated by Moscow and at the center of an EU antitrust case accusing Gazprom of abusing its market dominance, sent a letter of protest to Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.

EU sources say the Commission is in fact cultivating uncertainty by hinting that the pipeline may fall foul of EU rules, in the hope of scaring off Western investors, for a time at least. And in fact, last July, Gazprom's Western partners - Uniper (EONGn.DE), Wintershall (BASFn.DE), Shell (RDSa.L), OMV (OMVV.VI) and Engie (ENGIE.PA) - did withdraw from pledges to provide 1.2 billion euros of equity for the pipeline, a twin to Nord Stream 1, which began pumping in 2011 (para. 1-7).

Russian forces have been active in the border area, setting up what they described as a \u201cmonitoring office\u201d that looked like a military deployment in videos broadcast in Russia. Ankara signaled its \u201cunease\u201d about the shooting and photographs of Russian soldiers posing with Kurdish fighters, said Huseyin Muftuoglu, foreign ministry spokesman. The Kurdish militia, known as the YPG, is considered a terrorist group by Ankara and was the primary target of Turkey\u2019s military excursion into Syria last year. Turkey\u2019s recent rapprochement with Russia has been described by government officials as a practical necessity for ending the fighting in Syria. The conflict has pushed nearly 3m refugees into Turkey and allowed the YPG to take advantage of US backing to create two large self-governed cantons alongside the border (para. 1-4). Imports of Russian wheat, maize and sunflower have been facing new obstacles since earlier this week, two Turkish importers said, but Turkish officials deny they amount to a ban or retaliation for Russian restrictions (para. 9).

Yilmaz, an expert in international relations, said Turkey is still expecting Russia to restore pre-crisis economic relations, as Moscow has not yet taken significant actions for import of Turkish products and a complete abolition of visa regime for Turkish citizens. \"During the meeting, Ankara intends to voice its position on the Gulen movement, accused of involvement in the attempted military coup in Turkey, as well as discuss Moscow's support for the Democratic Union Party (PYD) in Syria, which is considered by Ankara as a terrorist organization,\u201d he said. The expert added that in particular, Ankara expresses concern over the activity of PYD office in Moscow.\nYilmaz stressed that Turkey wants to purchase Russia's S-400 advanced surface-to-air missile systems to better protect its airspace, and it is expected to achieve progress in the matter in the meeting between the Russian and Turkish leaders. He added that Russia also hopes for Turkey\u2019s reciprocal understanding on a number of issues related to the Syrian conflict and NATO (para. 1-6). Azer News Website. (2017).

This should not come as a surprise, because the Russian ACF were kicked out of the Hamadan [military airbase] for 'ungentlemanly behavior' and 'arrogance'.

One of the two is likely to be disappointed.... Mr Erdogan decided to make friends with Mr Putin partly because having him as an enemy was so painful.

His fighter jets bombed Turkey\u2019s proxies inside Syria, including its ethnic cousins, the Turkmen, with impunity. Russia\u2019s missile defences denied Turkey access to the airspace over Syria. Russian sanctions cost Turkey at least $10bn in tourism and trade revenue.  Russia remains the stronger partner. Mr Erdogan\u2019s government has offered Rosatom, the Russian company building Turkey\u2019s first nuclear plant, sweeteners worth billions of dollars. It has endorsed Turkish Stream, a gas pipeline that would allow Russia to extend its grip over Turkey\u2019s and Europe\u2019s energy markets. (Turkey already depends on Russia for 55% of its natural gas imports.)

The government launched a massive crackdown following a failed coup attempt in July, while the country has seen an increase in attacks by the Islamic State terror group and by Kurdish separatists. Turkey\u2019s economy contracted in the third quarter of last year for the first time since 2009.\nA video released by the ruling Justice and Development party, or AKP, promised that a yes vote would result in lessened bureaucracy, faster growth and lasting political stability. \u201cTerror will fall off Turkey\u2019s agenda,\u201d the video\u2019s narrator says.\nCritics of the president say the changes would weaken democratic checks and balances, and object to the government\u2019s attempts to introduce the changes during a state of emergency first introduced after July\u2019s coup attempt.\nSince the failed coup, authorities have purged more than 140,000 civil servants and military personnel accused of supporting the alleged coup plotters.\nAround 40,000 people have been detained, including dozens of members of parliament, local political leaders and mayors from the pro-Kurdish mainstream opposition party.

Turkey has lost approximately four dozen soldiers since the start of its campaign in Syria in August.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin expressed condolences for the deaths in a call with Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, saying the friendly fire incident was due to poor coordination, according to the Russian news agency RIA.\nRussian-backed Syrian regime forces are positioned along the southern outskirts of al-Bab, while Turkey and allied Syrian rebels have the northern and western suburbs under their control.\nThe incident poses a fresh challenge to the protracted campaign by various international forces against Islamic State in Syria.\nTurkey has focused on seizing al-Bab, while the U.S. wants to prioritize a campaign to seize the terror group\u2019s de-facto capital of Raqqa. However, Turkish forces and their Syrian rebel allies have been bogged down around the town since November after seizing a more than 60-mile-long belt of territory along the Syrian-Turkish border from Islamic State.\nThe terror group had used the border area as a link between its so-called caliphate and the outside world, helping it to reinforce its fighters and launch terror attacks in Turkey and Western Europe. Many Islamic State fighters who survived Turkey\u2019s incursions in that area have fallen back to al-Bab.\nMomentum in the battle shifted this week, as Turkey announced the capture of strategic hilltops in the al-Bab suburbs, due in part to an uptick of air support and strikes by U.S.-led coalition fighter planes. Turkish officials said their troops were ready to thrust toward the center of town.\nU.S. officials hope that Turkey will succeed in al-Bab and free up Ankara\u2019s Syrian rebel allies to help in the fight for Raqqa.\nThat operation has stalled in part due to Turkey\u2019s insistence that the Syrian Kurdish fighters known as the YPG be sidelined from the battle. The Pentagon sees YPG fighters as the most capable local forces, but Turkey views them as a branch of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, which is designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the U.S. and Europe.\nThat tension also complicated an agreement between Ankara and Washington about the U.S. support role in al-Bab, according to U.S. and Turkish officials, leaving space for Russia to improve military coordination with Turkey (para. 1-10).

Montenegrin officials have publicly accused the Kremlin of trying to deter its membership by instigating an attempted coup against the government in October. Moscow has denied the charge. Formal U.S. backing for the Balkan nation\u2019s admission could emerge as the first flash-point between Washington and Moscow since Mr. Trump took office, current and former U.S. officials said. At the same time, they said, the Kremlin may believe that Mr. Trump can go only so far in moderating U.S. policies concerning Russia and wouldn\u2019t expect him to make a sudden, sharp reversal on a decision made by the Obama administration in 2015.\n\u201cWe would have been seen as caving to Russia and reneging on a commitment already made,\u201d said Douglas Lute, an ambassador to NATO under President Barack Obama. \u201cWe would have cracked the alliance.\u201d\nEither way, Mr. Trump\u2019s support for Montenegro is seen as critical to bolstering NATO and countering Russian aggression in Europe.\n\u201cOpponents of these processes, like Russia, tend to be the most active in the times when decisions still have to be made,\u201d said Lithuania\u2019s ambassador to NATO, Vytautas Leskevicius. \u201cAfter all 28 allies have ratified Montenegro\u2019s accession protocol, we may expect calmer times.\u201d\nTo date, 23 out of 28 NATO members have formally voted to accept Montenegro. Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain have yet to approve the country\u2019s membership bid, while the Greek parliament has passed a ratification measure but hasn\u2019t officially notified the alliance (para. 1-8).

The deepening ties threaten to marginalize the United States in the struggle to shape Syria\u2019s ultimate fate.\nThe air missions, which took place for about a week near the strategically important town of Al Bab, represent the Kremlin\u2019s first use of its military might to help the Turks in their fight against the militant group. The Russians seized an opening to try to build a military relationship with Turkey, a NATO member, as the United States has sought to keep the emphasis on taking Raqqa, the Islamic State\u2019s self-declared capital.\nThe Russian bombing is a remarkable turnabout from November 2015, when a Turkish F-16 fighter jet shot down a Russian Su-24 attack plane that had violated Turkey\u2019s airspace.\nRussia and Turkey had already been involved in a joint effort to establish a cease-fire in Syria \u2014 one that does not involve the United States. At the same time, ties between the United States and Turkey have come under growing strain as the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has become increasingly alarmed about the Kurdish forces known as the Y.P.G. The United States has aligned itself with those forces to combat the Islamic State in Syria.\nSome analysts say Russia appears to have arrived at an accommodation in which the Turks are moving to establish a security zone in northern Syria to preclude Syrian Kurds from setting up an autonomous region. In return, the Turks appear to be backing off their efforts to unseat President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, who, with Russian help, is strengthening his hold on the country\u2019s major cities to the south.\n\u201cThe Russian-Turkish rapprochement is largely tactical,\u201d said James F. Jeffrey, a former United States ambassador to Turkey. \u201cRussia can live for now with a Turkish enclave in northern Syria if it does not threaten the Assad regime. And it allows Russia to exploit the U.S. shift to Turkey\u2019s rival, the Y.P.G., by providing air support to the Turks against the Islamic State, which the U.S. inexplicably is not providing\u201d (para. 1-6).

Russia and Turkey not only agreed on the evacuation of Aleppo in the last days of 2016, which was described by Putin as \"the biggest humanitarian operation in the world,\" they also played a key role in establishing a nationwide cease-fire in war-torn Syria (para. 8). \"Turkey and Russia seem to be getting over the jet crisis and the murder of the Russian ambassador.

They need to make a lot of progress toward it. However, we should expect 'controlled optimism,' for relations in the next year,\" he said. New economic projects and the course of the Syrian crisis will likely give direction to the future of relations between the two countries in 2017.

Turkish contractors, who have suffered some of the largest losses because of the sanctions, had said in late June that construction projects worth $2 billion were ready for signing, but little progress has been made. In regard to fresh fruits and vegetables, top Turkish export items to Russia, only citrus exports have thus far received the green light to resume. According to figures by Turkey\u2019s Fresh Fruits and Vegetables Exporters Union, Russia, the sector\u2019s top buyer in 2015, fell to 18th place in October, with exports dropping by 99%. According to the Turkish Exports Assembly\u2019s October figures, total exports were down 5% compared with 2015. The organization\u2019s chairman, Mehmet Buyukeksi, said the improvement in ties with Russia over the past five months had yet to make an impact on exports. Disappointment is also gripping the tourism sector after initial optimism over the Putin-Erdogan meeting in August. Russia delayed the resumption of charter flights until October, when tourist season draws to a close. According to October figures, the largest losses in the tourism sector stemmed from the decline in Russian visitors. In the Mediterranean province of Antalya, the favorite Turkish destination of Russian holidaymakers, the number of Russian tourists was down more than 60% from 2015, and the drop in revenue exceeded $5 billion.\" (...) \"Turkey\u2019s deep disappointment with the pace of economic fence mending was perhaps best reflected in remarks Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci made earlier this month. Stressing that he had had numerous phone calls with Russian ministers, Zeybekci said, \u201cIf it goes on like this, we cannot say that all is fine in our relations with Russia. This could lead us to take measures against each other in economic terms, and we, too, will do what is necessary.\u201d\" In a presentation to parliament on the current state of Turkish-Russian economic ties last week, Zeybekci listed ongoing restrictions: visa-free travel remains suspended; restrictions on fresh fruits and vegetables exports continue; Turkish companies remain banned from six sectors; the ban on employing Turkish workers continues; and the number of transit documents for Turkish cargo trucks has been reduced from 9,000 to 2,000.

But I always had a more constructive approach and I hoped that our relations with our neighbor and trading partner will normalize. Even before the coup attempt, a month or two before, our relations began to normalize with Russia. So, it's a process of normalization of relations with Russia.

So, our first priority is to get back to the situation before the crisis and then build on. Russia is our main trading partner and we want to have a constructive relation mutually beneficial.

Also, fleeing ISIS fighters could easily reach Turkey and a reactivated visa system could help provide an easy route to Russia and  help them to realize their threat (1)\n1:   http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/isis-video-russia-vladimir-putin-youtube-jihad-threat-a7165916.html\n "], [1031, "2016-10-23T17:59:38Z", [0.15], ""], [691, "2016-10-23T15:45:53Z", [0.52], ""], [424, "2016-10-23T14:28:09Z", [0.51], ""], [29703, "2016-10-23T05:38:53Z", [0.05], ""], [28414, "2016-10-22T21:19:33Z", [0.33], ""], [28414, "2016-10-22T21:10:47Z", [0.35], ""], [368, "2016-10-22T19:48:25Z", [0.95], ""], [691, "2016-10-22T17:00:18Z", [0.54], ""], [14777, "2016-10-22T00:47:36Z", [0.6], ""], [27504, "2016-10-21T20:28:13Z", [0.15], ""], [368, "2016-10-21T18:29:55Z", [0.95], ""], [4273, "2016-10-21T17:49:20Z", [0.55], ""], [691, "2016-10-21T17:04:43Z", [0.55], ""], [29681, "2016-10-21T12:57:28Z", [0.25], ""], [4729, "2016-10-21T00:07:06Z", [0.75], ""], [4729, "2016-10-21T00:06:00Z", [0.1], ""], [691, "2016-10-20T22:09:38Z", [0.57], ""], [29674, "2016-10-20T20:26:20Z", [0.38], ""], [10759, "2016-10-20T05:44:26Z", [0.6], ""], [4634, "2016-10-20T05:44:16Z", [0.6], ""], [368, "2016-10-19T21:38:47Z", [0.95], ""], [151, "2016-10-19T20:27:23Z", [0.25], ""], [29664, "2016-10-19T20:04:35Z", [0.5], ""], [691, "2016-10-19T19:33:52Z", [0.6], ""], [14777, "2016-10-19T18:43:26Z", [0.63], ""], [1708, "2016-10-19T18:26:35Z", [0.65], ""], [15003, "2016-10-19T09:07:54Z", [0.6], ""], [19538, "2016-10-19T08:51:36Z", [0.15], ""], [29268, "2016-10-19T08:02:01Z", [0.0], ""], [22276, "2016-10-19T06:24:05Z", [0.75], "Yes, Turkey will  allow citizens to travel to Russia without a visa.

That Turks shouldn't enjoy visa-free travel to Russia yet due to the security reasons (meaning ISIS). While it sounds reasonable, the Turks enjoyed visa-free regime before, when ISIS was at the peak of their expansion. Furthermore, at that time Turkey had much less confrontational approach to ISIS as the latter fought the Kurds, the main adversary for Turkey. Meaning ISIS  fighters could penetrate Russia easier than now. This visa-free regime was cancelled completely for political reasons - to punish Turkey for downing of the Russian military plane. The Russian- Turkish relationships were restored again for poltical reasons - Erdogan apologized to the families of Russian pilots when seeking counterbalance to the West. So the visa-free regime can be restored purely for political reasons too. Besides, all this time Russians have enjoyed visa-free travel to go to Turkey (only some categories of visitors need business visas like, i believe, truck-drivers).
