Also this from Amy Howe at ScotusBlog\n\"...The only cases left from October are Epic Systems v. Lewis (arbitration) and Gill v. Whitford (redistricting). Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Neil Gorsuch have not yet written opinions from this sitting. Either way, that bodes well for the employers in Epic.\n       All of the opinions from the November sitting have been released. It was a light sitting by any standard, with only six decisions, which means that three justices \u2013 Roberts, Gorsuch, and Justice Anthony Kennedy \u2013 did not write at all. Gorsuch has already picked up an extra case in December, for which he wrote two opinions (SAS Institute v. Iancu and Murphy v. Smith); this likely means that Roberts and Kennedy will pick up extra opinions in April, which had 12 cases.\n       There are two cases outstanding from the court\u2019s December sitting, and (like October) they are both big ones: Carpenter v. United States (cellphone records) and Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission (same-sex wedding cakes).  Neither Roberts nor Kennedy has written yet for December, which makes for interesting possibilities. Four years ago, Roberts wrote for the court in Riley v. California, holding that police generally must get a warrant to search the digital information on the cellphone of someone who has been arrested, and he seemed more sympathetic to Carpenter than the government at the oral argument last year; if Roberts is instead writing in Masterpiece, it would seem to bode well for the baker....\" \nhttp://amylhowe.com/2018/05/16/reading-tea-leaves-mid-may-edition/"], [1056, "2018-05-19T14:26:35Z", [0.8], ""], [691, "2018-05-17T14:52:44Z", [0.49], ""], [974, "2018-05-16T17:48:07Z", [0.85], ""], [1333, "2018-05-16T15:08:36Z", [0.85], ""], [1333, "2018-05-16T14:24:11Z", [0.75], "This will come in on a Acts are Speech argument - like flag burning....being forced to make a cake was also being forced to make a statement - thus they were compelled to bake the cake unconstitutionally."], [37488, "2018-05-16T02:58:11Z", [0.65], ""], [4681, "2018-05-15T18:34:09Z", [0.75], ""], [32258, "2018-05-15T18:06:12Z", [0.02], "Had been at 0 since November and 20 for the last month.

The Eighth Amendment prevents excessive fines, and cruel and unusual punishment.

Kennedy holds the crucial vote and has said both things.  He asked whether a baker could put a sign in his window saying, \u201cWe do not bake cakes for gay weddings.\u201d A lawyer for the Trump administration, which supports the Colorado baker, said yes, so long as the cakes were custom made.  Justice Kennedy responded by saying\" \u201cYou would not think that an affront to the gay community?\u201d   But Justice Kennedy has also said that \"a state civil rights commission that had ruled against the baker had been \u201cneither tolerant nor respectful of Mr. Phillips\u2019s religious beliefs.\u201d Key is the bakers response, that \"he would not use his talents to convey a message of support for same-sex marriage as that would clash with his religious faith.\"  It's specially concerning to the Court that a decision in favor of the baker could undermine the 2015 that allowed same-sex marriage, \"by allowing all sorts of artists, artisans and professionals to refuse to provide goods and services for same-sex weddings.\"   Justice Kennedy said in arguments in December that \"the problem for is that so many of these examples \u2014 and a photographer can be included \u2014 do involve speech,\u201d and that \u201cIt means that there\u2019s basically an ability to boycott gay marriages.\u201d Justice Kennedy also seemed troubled by the Colorado Civil Rights Commission earlier ruling on he case that required the baker to \"retrain his employees, who included family members, and to tell them that a state anti-discrimination law overrode their religious beliefs.\"  In all, liberal justices \"questioned whether all sorts of people \u2014 tailors, hair stylists, makeup artists, chefs, architects \u2014 could refuse to supply goods and services for same-sex weddings\" while conservative justices considered \"whether artists can be required to convey messages with which they profoundly disagree.\"  One would think religious freedom and right to free speech principles will prevail in a majority conservative SCOTUS but then what happens to the discrimination that such a ruling would seem to open?

I will expand on my thought and clarify. I think there is only a 5% chance that SCOTUS will not find that the statute implicates 1st amendment rights under the specific circumstances of this case. I do actually think there is a 95% chance that SCOTUS will rule that 1st amendment rights are implicated here, but that does not mean they will invalidate the statute. More likely a compromise would be reached within the current Court. They will definitely recognize his religious liberties and wax poetic about that. But they will also wax poetic about LGBTQ rights, and the rights of artists like cake designers since that is the hook the cake shop is using. To balance these rights they will likely keep the anti-discrimination statute but allow an \"out\" of sorts. My best guess is that they will make it clear that such statutes cannot apply to businesses that are not open to the public. A business that is open to the public must serve the public. They cannot refuse a customer for discriminatory reasons. The only way for the cake shop to operate legally and decline customers such as these would be to change their business model to not be open to the public. So everyone wins. The cake designer and other persons at a business whose religious beliefs are violated by such a statute are free to do several things that may be mentioned in the opinion. They can leave their job, change locations to somewhere not covered by such a statute (eg, the feds have no such anti-discrimination statute and the majority of states do not yet either), engage in the political process to repeal or amend such a statute, or the one I think is most likely to happen: close their doors to the public and be completely be appointment only (like commissioning a painting or any kind of creative work by an artist. They could invoke copyright law and possibly say that the author of any copyrightable work has the right to decline to produce such a work, but only if they are not operating as a place of public accomodation open to the public. Creative works have strong legal protections, so that combined with the religious liberties aspect and the current Court means some kind of compromise is likely)."], [49645, "2018-01-24T00:53:29Z", [0.2], "SCOTUS has punted a lot of thorny social questions for very technical reasons.

SOEDA does put sexual orientation into a protected class but not for refusal of service, only for specific employment matters.

On the other hand, Justice Kennedy separately said:\n\"JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the problem for you is that so many of these examples -- and a photographer can be included -- do involve speech. It means that there's basically an ability to boycott gay marriages.\" I'm surprised Justice Kennedy did not seem too concerned by the fact that the baker refused to create a cake that may've been identical to that requested by a heterosexual couple whose marriage was agreeable to the baker's religion. See, for example, this exchange in particular: MR. COLE: If -- if he is not doing it on the basis of the identity -- a protected identity.

We just refuse to admit those who are engaged in interracial marriages or advocate interracial dating. And this Court said that's race discrimination. That's identity-based discrimination, even if you treat others similarly. But -- but I think one way to think about this case is -- is -- is analogize it to O'Brien, right? In O'Brien, nobody disputed that O'Brien's burning of the draft card to protest the Vietnam War was expressive. It was core political expression. But what the Court did was it didn't say, well, how expressive is it? Is it\nartistry; is it not? Is it core; is it not? It said what is the state trying to do here? Because it's expressive conduct.

Is this overburdening the baker or is the law protecting against discrimination in a way that doesn't unduly burden the baker? Because in limited situations, compelled expression could violate first amendment. But how that can that be judged here?  So back to the definition of art... just the mere request for a cake to be made was denied because it was for a same sex wedding. The \"art\" is the creation of the cake --- denied because of where it was going (SS wedding). We don't know what the cake would have looked like.. it could have been a request for plain.. we don't know.

So now, to the Supreme Court to get an its free speech not conduct ruling.   I recall there was some justice of the peace that refused to give out marriage certificates on this basis and was told then you can have that belief but you cannot have that job and discriminate against others with alternate belief systems / religious beliefs.   Right, crystallising my thoughts a little now.  On religion - Can I walk into a kosher restaurant and demand they serve me a nonkosher meal.  No - they would say thats not on the menu and they would say that to everyone.  Philips is saying I wont make you a wedding cake as two men / women, but I will make them a wedding cake.  cant see how that freedom of religion will win out here - thats a can of worms.  So can he refuse to write this as part of his service as a freedom of speech?  Well no-one is saying he cannot have his belief or freedoms, the courts to date are saying, that you can have your freedoms, but so can they and if you will make a cake for x then you must make same cake for y.  I dont buy into the Halloween cake thing as he wont sell a halloween cake to anyone, even his mom, here is saying i wont make you a wedding cake but i will them.  So, feels different to me.   So its really, must he be forced to do something he just doesnt want to.  thats the bit that gets me.  and I guess the bit the judges will struggle with.  I am assuming they will say, listen chap, you live in a diverse community.  if you want to stop selling wedding cakes, so be it - we wont force you to make wedding cakes, but if you make wedding cakes you will make them for everyone in your community and not just those you like the look of.  Now naturally, Phillips should then go back to the kitchen, and if he doesnt like the look of someone he should just say that he's too busy to take their order, not say - i am not making you a cake because my belief system is different to yours (which then makes you think his ability for free speech is hindered), and the answer to that in my mind is, you cannot go around saying \"i've got a bomb in my bag\" when you enter an airport and then claim freedon of speech as part of your defence / sue.  Freedom of speech comes with responsibilty / conventions, in this case he is offering a service, the convention for freedom of speech in service is it must be offered consistently - hence the rulings to date.  So, i can live with that consistency is king here, if you want to make and sell wedding cakes you must do so for everyone or stop for everyone.  If you want to speak out about your beliefs thats also fine, but dont confuse that with the convention youre in.

Colorado Civil Rights Commission. The case, in which a conservative Christian bakery owner seeks the right to discriminate against gay couples, is the latest attempt by conservatives to carve out special exemption for business owners to civil rights laws. If the briefs filed by the petitioner and its most influential allies are any indication, the strategy will likely be to portray this case as a unique one that would warrant a very narrow constitutional exception. But don\u2019t be fooled. If the state of Colorado\u2019s application of its laws is found to be unconstitutional, it would unleash a widespread assault on civil rights protections. In 2012, David Mullins and Charlie Craig visited Masterpiece Cakeshop in Lakewood, Colorado, to arrange for a cake to be made for their wedding reception. They were told by Jack Phillips, the store\u2019s owner, that he could not fulfill their order because his religious beliefs prevented him from preparing goods for same-sex wedding ceremonies (although he was otherwise willing to serve LBGT customers). Mullins and Craig sued Masterpiece under Colorado civil rights law, which forbids discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation by \u201cpublic accommodations\u201d (businesses or other institutions that are regularly open to the public). Mullins and Craig won: the Colorado Civil Rights Division agreed that Masterpiece had illegally discriminated against them, and its decision was upheld by the Colorado Court of Appeals. Masterpiece appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case. It would be natural to assume that this case will be argued on the basis of freedom of religion protections in the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The Supreme Court has recently given companies broad freedom to ignore laws in deference to the owner\u2019s religious faith. In Burwell v. Hobby Lobby the Court held that employers could reject requirements that taxpayer-subsidized employer-provided health insurance cover contraception if doing so would violate the religious beliefs. But while Masterpiece has raised religious freedom objections, the case is unlikely to turn on these grounds. Since the 1990 decision in Employment Division v. Smith, the Supreme Court has held that the free exercise of religion clause of the First Amendment is not violated when a religion-neutral law incidentally burdens an individual\u2019s religious beliefs, as long as that law did not intentionally target religious minorities. Colorado\u2019s application of civil rights law clearly did not violate the free exercise clause based on this precedent, so an argument solely on free religion grounds would be a certain loser. The Hobby Lobby ruling was based not on the First Amendment but on the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), a statute passed in response to Employment Division. Since the 1997 Supreme Court ruling in City of Boerne v. Flores, however, RFRA does not apply to state governments. It would therefore be nearly impossible for Masterpiece to prevail on a religious freedom claim. Backed up by a brief from the Trump administration\u2019s Department of Justice, Masterpiece will almost certainly focus on another part of the First Amendment: the free speech clause. The shop is arguing that, given the artistry involved in creating a custom wedding cake, compelling it to create a cake for a ceremony it morally disapproves of would violate its rights to freedom of speech and expression. Creating religious exceptions to generally applicable laws would make civil rights statutes very difficult to enforce, since discrimination based on race, gender, or sexual orientation can all be defended on religious grounds. If applied logically, a religious exemption would quickly mean that civil rights laws exist only at the pleasure of the employer. Recognizing this liability in a free expression argument, Masterpiece will likely claim that a free expression exemption applies only in the very narrow context of a mom-and-pop bakery being asked to make something for a particular ceremony. Most employees of most companies, they will argue, are not engaged in activity that is similarly expressive. But as the libertarian legal scholars Dale Carpenter and Eugene Volokh argue in their persuasive amicus brief on behalf of Colorado, if Masterpiece\u2019s free speech claim were accepted by the Court, it would \u201capply to a vast range of conduct.\u201d Many of the activities employees and their supervisors engage in on the job have elements as potentially \u201cexpressive\u201d as baking a cake, and this is true of both tiny storefronts and Fortune 500 corporations. \u201c[Restaurant chain] Subway calls its sandwich-makers \u2018sandwich artists,\u2019\u201d Carpenter and Volokh observe, \u201c[b]ut a restaurant may not refuse to cook or prepare a table for certain customers on the ground that it would be a free speech compulsion.\u201d Similarly, a florist who didn\u2019t want to participate in a same-sex wedding could declare themselves \u201cfloral artists,\u201d hotel receptionists could declare themselves \u201cphone answering artists,\u201d and so on. It is unclear about where the line would end up being drawn should the Court accept Masterpiece\u2019s free speech argument. But even if it ended up being fairly narrow, it would still require extensive litigation to find out. And it\u2019s likely that in practice the exceptions would not be narrow at all. The wise approach for the Supreme Court would be to follow the lead of the Colorado court and uphold the sound judgement of the state\u2019s civil rights commission: that while Jack Phillips is entitled to his beliefs, when he opens a business to the public he is required to follow state laws and treat his customers equally.\n"], [42, "2017-11-08T01:27:36Z", [0.25], "refusal on religious grounds in a private bakery may outweigh any anti-discrimination laws"], [8670, "2017-11-08T00:52:51Z", [0.09], ""], [41273, "2017-11-07T22:34:58Z", [0.05], ""], [41273, "2017-11-07T22:31:20Z", [0.15], ""], [38096, "2017-11-07T21:39:54Z", [0.85], ""], [745, "2017-11-07T18:58:01Z", [0.1], ""], [12879, "2017-11-07T17:37:42Z", [0.25], ""], [4431, "2017-11-07T13:56:37Z", [0.15], ""], [40165, "2017-11-07T12:47:25Z", [1.0], ""], [38516, "2017-11-07T02:17:22Z", [0.75], "The supreme court will realize that any law forcing someone to abandon their religious beliefs is unconstitutional"], [23006, "2017-11-06T22:33:07Z", [0.02], "I see this as a business transaction not an expression of art (even if the cakemaker is a unique cakemaker) whick cakemaker provided with limits.

For example, a taxicab cannot discriminate against any prospective passenger because it falls under common carrier law. But Uber or Lyft can discriminate because they're ostensibly accepting a \"contract\" proffered by someone who wants a ride. So I suppose it's possible that Masterpiece can be found to have two identities - one as a public accommodation, which would require Masterpiece to sell cakes to anyone who could pay for one, and the other as a \"contractor\" which would permit Masterpiece to accept or reject assignments as it pleased. I have no idea if this scenario could play out in legal terms, but bring it up because I would like to know if it's possible from the Supreme Court to find for Masterpiece, but not base its decision on the 1st amendment, but rather on statute law governing the obligations of public accommodations vs. contractors.

(gays, lesbians, Jews, Muslims, and Protestants need not apply) Or being able to say, I'm an \"artist\" and therefore have the rights to express my art even though I'm in a business that is open to the public?  If a person feels so strongly about such topics, perhaps they need to change how they do business or what business they are in... For example, saying they don't produce halloween cakes is fine (regardless of why they don't make them) because they won't make them for anyone. But being in the business of wedding cakes is quite different as you put yourself right in the middle of religion and set yourself up for discriminating against those with whom you disagree. Masterpiece talks about freedom of expression; which in this case would mean certain speech. The details of what the cake would look like or what it would say never became part of this case because Phillips stopped the couple from even ordering by virtue of them being homosexuals who wanted to marry. That was enough for Phillips; was never about the \"specifics\" of the speech or art that he uses as a defense. The reverse, ie. censorship (cases) involved \"specifics\".

I may switch answer choice... Note: for questions in the SCOTUS challenge I am limiting self to 0 and 100% as answer choices, which do not reflect my assessment of the actual probabilities. I think this case is entirely up to whatever Justice Kennedy wants to do. I'm not sure of what he'll do.  Kennedy has a track record penning opinions that defend the free exercise of religion. \nFor example, he joined a fairly recent opinion by Justice Alito preventing the federal government from requiring a corporation to provide contraceptives. Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 2751 (2014). In addition to joining the majority's vote, Justice Kennedy separately concurred: \"Free exercise in this sense implicates more than just freedom of belief... It means, too, the right to express those beliefs and to establish one's religious (or nonreligious) self-definition in the political, civic, and economic life of our larger community. But in a complex society and an era of pervasive governmental regulation, defining the proper realm for free exercise can be difficult. In these cases the plaintiffs deem it necessary to exercise their religious beliefs within the context of their own closely held, for-profit corporations...\" Id. (citations omitted).  Kennedy wrote the Court's opinion holding that members of the Santeria religion may not be prohibited by a discriminatory law targeting their practice of animal sacrifice. Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 US 520 (1993).  But Justice Kennedy found the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act exceeded proper exercise of the enforcement power over states in City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 US 507 (1997). In that case, Justice Kennedy opined \"Requiring a State to demonstrate a compelling interest and show that it has adopted the least restrictive means of achieving that interest is the most demanding test known to constitutional law. If compelling interest' really means what it says many laws will not meet the test. [The test] would open the prospect of constitutionally required religious exemptions from civic obligations of almost every conceivable kind... Even assuming RFRA would be interpreted in effect to mandate some lesser test... the statute nevertheless would require searching judicial scrutiny of state law with the attendant likelihood of invalidation. This is a considerable congressional intrusion into the States' traditional prerogatives and general authority to regulate for the health and welfare of their citizens.\" Id. at 534 (internal quotations, and citations omitted). He went on, \"When the exercise of religion has been burdened in an incidental way by a law of general application, it does not follow that the persons affected have been burdened any more than other citizens, let alone burdened because of their religious beliefs. In addition, the Act imposes in every case a least restrictive means requirement... which also indicates that the legislation is broader than is appropriate if the goal is to prevent and remedy constitutional violations.\") Id. at 535. Petitioner (cake-shop/cake-artist) in this case asserts the first-amendment right to free exercise of religion explored in the above cases. From Respondents' point of view, the shop is compelled to make the cake by Colorado's public accommodation laws, which protect people against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Kennedy is the author of landmark opinions that acknowledged now important Constitutional rights of people who are same-sex. Lawrence v. Texas (right to engage in certain intimate sexual contact); Obergefell v. Hodges (right to marry). I expect the votes to be 5-4, split along the same lines as Obergefell except that Gorsuch replaces Scalia's dissent. (This could be wrong to the extent Justices who dissented or disagree with Obergefell nevertheless find it somehow to be a precedent they are bound to follow to a conclusion they dislike. But I highly doubt it. Roberts, for example, couldn't've sounded more frustrated and disappointed about Obergefell.[2]) If I'm wrong and the law is found violative of first amendment rights, Kennedy may not write the opinion. If the forecast is correct, I think Kennedy will almost certainly write the opinion.
