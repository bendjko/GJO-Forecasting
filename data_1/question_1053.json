Increasing my forecast from 2 to 5%.\n~~~~~~~\nhttps://thebulletin.org/2019/12/santa-kim-is-coming-to-town-with-north-korean-gifts-that-keep-on-giving/ \" . . .Kim is likely gearing up for one of three possibilities: a second launch of the Hwasong-15 ICBM (the same one launched once in November 2017); the inaugural flight-test of a solid propellant ICBM or intermediate-range ballistic missile; or the inaugural launch of a new-generation of space launch vehicle. The \u201cvery important\u201d test that was carried out on December 7 at the Sohae Satellite Launching Ground\u2019s static liquid propellant engine test stand would suggest that Kim\u2019s scientists have just tested a large liquid propellant engine; that is a reliable short- to medium-term indicator of new launch activity. In March 2017, at Sohae, Kim oversaw the first-ever test of the RD-250-variant engine that would weeks later see (unsuccessful) testing under the Hwasong-12 intermediate-range ballistic missile. In late-June 2017, Kim similarly oversaw the testing of the upper-stage engine of the Hwasong-14, which was launched just weeks later. There is reason to expect that whatever North Korea does will include something qualitatively new. For instance, if Kim does order a second test of the Hwasong-15 ICBM, we may expect to see a new type of indigenously built heavy launch vehicle. That would be a notable development, as it would indicate that North Korea had managed to successfully wean itself off its reliance on the six-odd heavy logging trucks that it had imported under false pretext from China and converted for use as transporter-erector-launchers. Separately, Kim may choose to use a new launch to overfly Japan into the northern Pacific with an ICBM\u2014something North Korea has never done before. A recent statement hinting that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe should expect to see a ballistic missile suggests that whatever may be coming is likely to either splash down in the waters around Japan or overfly the country. Kim may also choose to demonstrate a multiple reentry vehicle capability off the Hwasong-15. Perhaps the most interesting option for North Korea, however, would be a space launch. Unlike missile tests, which are revealed to the world only when they happen, North Korea insists that its space activities are entirely civilian in nature and peaceful. In the past, this has meant that it goes to pains to behave like a \u201cnormal\u201d country, issuing warnings to respectable international organizations like the International Maritime Organization indicating hazard zones for spent rocket stages falling back to earth. There hasn\u2019t been a satellite launch in North Korea since February 2016 and, in late-2017 and early-2018, there were strong signs that Pyongyang was hard at work at a successor generation of space launch vehicles to the Unha-3, which launched the Kwangmyongsong-4 satellite in 2016. North Korean space program officials have indicated interest in geosynchronous orbit payloads and earth-observation satellites. None of North Korea\u2019s previous orbital payloads are known to have performed useful remote sensing work; that may be about to change. In the present political context, the advantage of a space launch would be for North Korea to engineer a crisis with the Trump administration. The administration\u2014at least with Iran\u2014has made clear that, from their view, space launch vehicles and ICBMs are birds of a feather (even though, in practice, this relationship is overstated and largely misunderstood). Could Trump overlook an announced space launch by North Korea\u2014or would he seek to rush to the negotiating table to prevent that from happening as he approaches an election? Pyongyang may be betting on the latter, hoping to pull off a \u201creverse Leap Day Deal,\u201d where a space launch announcement salvages diplomacy with the United States rather than scuttling it. But that\u2019s just the \u201cChristmas gift.\u201d Exhausting the possible range of other \u201cgifts\u201d that might lie ahead into 2020 is less simple. After the December 7 test, Kim Yong Chol, formerly Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s negotiating counterpart, released a statement in which he underscored that North Korea\u2019s objective was to \u201csurprise\u201d President Trump. That\u2019s not a particularly comforting assertion, as North Korea potentially has plenty of surprises up its sleeve. Two of its threats from 2017\u2014to bracket the waters around Guam with ballistic missiles and to conduct an atmospheric nuclear test\u2014were never formally taken off the table. Recently, too, North Korea demonstrated that it has a new ballistic missile submarine under construction. Over the course of 2020, North Korea could also look to conduct a test of its new Pukguksong-3 submarine-launched ballistic missile off of either that submarine or its older Gorae-class submarine. Separately, analysts have noticed intriguing activity at the ever-mysterious experimental light water reactor at the Yongbyon nuclear complex. Could a formal start-up of that reactor lie ahead? During his 2019 New Year\u2019s Day address, Kim did spend considerable time discussing domestic sources of electricity, including \u201catomic power.\u201d Any or all of these \u201csurprises\u201d may lie ahead. In his statement, Kim Yong Chol indicated that North Korea was returning to its old risk-acceptant ways, underscoring that Pyongyang had \u201cnothing to lose.\u201d In short, Kim has a long list of options to choose from\u2014and he\u2019s probably checking it twice before he makes his mind up. In fact, an official statement from Pyongyang released Thursday notes that the United States\u2019 decision to call a new session of the United Nations Security Council to discuss North Korean missile launches \u201chelped us make a definite decision on what way to choose,\u201d suggesting that Kim had been keeping his options open. Kim and the US election. President Trump\u2019s recent reaction to North Korea\u2019s test at Sohae contained a curious assertion: Kim \u201cdoes not want to void his special relationship with the President of the United States or interfere with the US Presidential Election in November.\u201d Trump has famously been unwilling to acknowledge the well-substantiated Russian state-backed effort to interfere in the 2016 election, so it is curious that North Korea\u2014a country that has not publicly, credibly been accused of election interference\u2014came under his microscope. Could the president have an unpublicized deal with Kim to hold off on missile and nuclear testing through the 2020 US elections? Publicly available evidence would suggest no, but complete accounts of the president\u2019s discussions with Kim Jong Un are not readily available. The president, after Singapore, made a habit of emphasizing that his diplomacy had gotten North Korea to stop launching ballistic missiles and conducting nuclear tests. In April 2018, Kim Jong Un, at the fourth plenum of the 7th Central Committee of the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea, announced a unilateral moratorium on ICBM and nuclear tests\u2014with the reasoning that North Korea\u2018s development efforts through 2017 were so robust that no further testing was required. Trump still used the moratorium to great effect, convincing many of his supporters that his bold and personal diplomacy with Kim had gotten results that no American leaders had gotten in the past. (Kim\u2019s father agreed to a long-range missile testing moratorium in 1999 that lasted through July 2006.) Kim Jong Un, however, does have leverage to engineer a crisis at an inopportune time. With an election less than eleven months away, Trump has reason to stay Kim\u2019s hand from signing any ICBM test orders, lest the fiction of the \u201cSingapore process\u201d erode completely in the eyes of the American public. But, as 2017 showed, North Korea\u2019s search for leverage in the form of qualitatively advancing its nuclear forces can push decision-makers in Washington toward dangerous ends. Where Trump\u2019s instincts during the diplomatic process with Kim were to express his feelings through heartfelt letters, hand-written and delivered to Kim\u2019s desk, the president may find himself once again drawn to expressing himself through \u201cfire and fury,\u201d sparking a new crisis."], [81096, "2019-12-15T07:47:57Z", [0.02], "NK language suggests \"gift\" would occur after 1/1 deadline"], [691, "2019-12-14T19:53:13Z", [0.02], "They seem still to be at the bench-test stage, but the impending \"Christmas gift\" may yet be an ICBM launch.

These threats have not been the only ones made by North Korea recently. On Oct. 24, Kim Gye Gwan, an adviser to the country\u2019s Foreign Ministry, said \u201cwe want to see how wisely the US will pass the end of the year.\u201d If this statement was gently worded, it was only in relation to the far harsher statement from Kim Yong-chol, vice chairman of the Central Committee of the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea.  On Oct. 27, Kim released a statement in his capacity as chairman of the Korea Asia-Pacific Peace Committee, saying, \u201cThe US is seriously mistaken if it is of the idea of passing off in peace [at] the end of this year.\u201d While alternating between its hard and soft line approaches North Korea is simultaneously leaving open the possibility of a return to past provocations.  Relations between North Korea and the US do not seem to be progressing. Lee Soo-hyuck, South Korea\u2019s ambassador to the US, told journalists on Oct. 31 that he did not believe that there was any communication between the U.S. and North Korea, and admitted that he did not believe it likely that negotiations between the two countries would restart in November.  SOUTH KOREA\u2019S SPY AGENCY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT PROSPECTS FOR US-DPRK TALKS Not everyone is so pessimistic about prospects for US-DPRK talks. On Monday, during the parliamentary audit at the South Korean National Assembly, the National Intelligence Service (NIS) predicted that \u201cNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un will aim to resume US-DPRK summit talks in December, and, at the earliest, hold negotiations in November.\u201d  According to Lee Hye-hoon, the chairman of the National Assembly\u2019s intelligence committee, \u201cThe NIS predicts that North Korea\u2019s goal is to hold a US-DPRK summit this December.\u201d Throwing some cold water on that prediction, the NIS then claimed that it had not made any reference to a specific timeline for the third US-North Korean summit. That being said, based on the agency\u2019s briefings of the intelligence committee in the National Assembly, and its references to negotiations between the US and North Korea in November and early December, the NIS appears optimistic about the possibility of talks between the U.S. and North Korea by the end of this year. How the NIS views prospects for US-North Korean talks is significant, particularly when compared to the opinions held by run-of-the-mill North Korea observers. The NIS is South Korea\u2019s intelligence agency and presumably bases its predictions on facts, which makes them worthy of special consideration. The NIS has not specifically mentioned the facts that form the background to their prediction; nonetheless, it would be foolish to ignore their views.  OUTCOME OF US-DPRK TALKS UNCERTAIN AS TWO SIDES CONTINUE PUSH-AND-PULL North Korea\u2019s latest barrage of provocative statements are not as contradictory to the negotiations process between the US and the DPRK as they may seem. Intensifying tension through the creation of a crisis is a common way to bring two sides to the negotiation table. Embedded in North Korea\u2019s constant references to its \u201climited patience\u201d might actually be a plea to the US to re-enter negotiations before it\u2019s \u201ctoo late.\u201d   At the same time, North Korea\u2019s provocative statements may not lead to a positive outcome. While crises can lead to negotiations, it is uncertain at this moment whether that will be the case. We cannot rule out the possibility that North Korea may be building up a case to justify any future actions in another, more negative, direction should US-North Korean talks fail to bear any fruit.\n~~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  I am expecting DJT to jump at the chance for headlines about anything other than impeachment.

October 17, 2019  Headlines on Wednesday around the world have underscored the striking ridiculousness of North Korea\u2019s latest propaganda demonstration. Yes, that\u2019s indeed North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, astride a pale white horse, in the snow around the mythical Mount Paektu. But it\u2019d be a mistake to brush off this latest North Korean spectacle as just another example of the country\u2019s seeming innate strangeness. The Kim-on-a-horse demonstration this week follows a long pattern of gradual and growing mythmaking around Kim Jong Un this year. . . .  While as suryong, or the supreme leader, his authority is unquestioned atop North Korea\u2019s monolithic political system, Kim Jong Un\u2019s place in internal propaganda remains below that of his father Kim Jong Il and especially his grandfather \u2014 the national founder \u2014 Kim Il Sung. In the days before the October 10 anniversary, which marks the founding of the predecessor to what eventually became the all-encompassing Workers\u2019 Party of Korea, North Korean state television ran a prominent new documentary lionizing Kim Jong Un.. . .underscoring his leadership of the ongoing ideological project outlined his in April 20, 2018, \u201cnew strategic line\u201d to focus all efforts on the economy. (In April 2018, Kim declared that his prior line of byungjin, or the simultaneous pursuit of a nuclear deterrent and economic strength, had been successfully accomplished in 2017).\n. . .\nNorth Korean propaganda isn\u2019t merely an aesthetic; it has a purpose. In context, Kim Jong Un\u2019s snowbound horseback joyride augurs a potential shift in national strategy in the weeks and months ahead. Indeed, with his New Year\u2019s Day warning this year of a \u201cnew way\u201d ahead should diplomacy with the United States lead to a dead end, Kim may be getting ready to take his country down a different path. The Korean Central News Agency\u2019s accompanying text to the images of Kim on a horse, however, tell an interesting story. The article references \u201cheadwinds\u201d and \u201carduous struggle,\u201d the latter an evocation of the \u201carduous march,\u201d or late-1990s famine in North Korea. With relief from international sanctions appearing a remote possibility as talks with the United States go nowhere, the message here is that harder economic times may lie ahead. But the message isn\u2019t doom-and-gloom: KCNA suggests that the purpose of Kim\u2019s visit to Mount Paektu has to do with his will to pursue economic renewal \u201cby its own efforts.\u201d\n. . .\n. . .  Kim was telling the party that they\u2019d have to buckle up and work hard; sanctions relief wasn\u2019t imminent. Now on horseback, he\u2019s reiterating that same message. Finally, the closing lines of the English translation of the KCNA article accompanying Kim\u2019s horseback photos has drawn attention. Kim, it is said, has promised to \u201cstrike the world with wonder again.\u201d That sounds ominous, but it may not necessarily indicate something like an intercontinental-range ballistic missile or nuclear test, breaking the April 2018 self-enforced moratorium. Instead, given the economic themes of this event, Kim may be poetically presaging something like a satellite launch. The space program has mostly been dormant in the propaganda sphere since the February 2016 launch of the Kwangmyongsong-4 satellite. Under Kim Jong Un, the space program has received considerable attention and has been set up as the paramount exemplar of North Korea\u2019s self-reliant, scientific capabilities. The first months of 2020 may have Kim looking to the stars once again.\n~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  It seems that KJU has his engineers focused on improving SLBMs.  DPRK's current SLBMs don't come close to being ICBMs.  My understanding is that because of the highly mobile launch pad of a sub, SLBMs don't need to have the range of ICBMs, so won't cause this question to resolve as \"yes\" even if beefed up.

The sample size is extremely small and such events are to a significant extent dictated by geopolitical concerns that evolve over time. Inside view:\n- Kim suspended all ICBM tests in 2018. [3]  \n- Capability: the clearly have the capability and I'd be surprised if they didn't have at least one other missile they could test.\n- Motivation: potential motivations are (1) testing of new designs and (2) signaling. This has to be counterbalanced against the costs of using up a rocket.\n- (1) seems unlikely. Kim seems to view his arsenal as complete. [2] The current design seem to fulfill the relevant requirements of reaching US mainland. It's not clear what the added benefits of a second design are. There are economies of scale from using one design. It also imposes the cost of potential geopolitical disadvantages, given the suspension.\n- (2) seems more likely but harder to evaluate. Non-ICBM missile tests seem to be mainly a response to military exercises [4] ICBM testing in terms of signaling is mainly relevant for US relations and internal stakeholders. However, it's not clear at all what another test would signal if it's the same technology, except for some general: \"We find the SQ unacceptable\". There also seems to be some sort of relevant deadline by the end of this year. [4] Overall, I don't think there is no strong case for NK to test ICBM for signaling reasons. Miscellaneous evidence:\n- Kim visiting potentially relevant facilities. [2] Based on all of this, my gut says 12%.

To me it seems that an announcement of no summit this year or a failed summit would greatly increase the chance of a test, but given the commitment to negotiations on both side, I think there is a 15% chance they won't happen. Therefore, I'd adjust from 25% to 20%. Kim's speech at the beginning of the year demonstrated a positive position and Trump seems to want to talk. This is by far one of the most promising developments in US-NK relationships and that can't be discounted. Further, when viewing this in the broader geo-political landscape the US may be willing to make economic concessions to China in return for their help with North Korea. The North could present challenges for China in the negotiation process, and given their struggling economy I don't think they would want to bring another risk to the trade discussion table. A deal with China on NK is something I think the current administration would view very positively (both at home and abroad).  Accounting for this is tricky. If trade talks break down I think there is a higher probability NK will start testing (30%). If a trade deal is struck with no mention of NK, I also think tests are more likely to commence because Kim will feel \"left in the cold\" (15%). If trade talks include NK (maybe not overtly) then I think missile test become less likely (55%). I think the last scenario is the mostly likely because in it, no party loses greatly. China gets an economic concessions, the US gets geo-political concessions, and NK will likely be compensated in some form by China for their cooperation.
