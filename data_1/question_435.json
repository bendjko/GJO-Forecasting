When the question mentions \"between 16 March 2017 and 16 March 2018\", is it INCLUSIVE of those dates?? My natural reading would be \"No\".  If you are AT one point, you are not BETWEEN than point and another. However, the FAQ suggests that the resolution will be \"Yes\".  The FAQ says, \"if the forecasting question asks about an event occurring before 31 December 2015, the deadline is 23:59:59 Pacific on 31 December 2015\".  This strongly suggests that terms like BEFORE or BETWEEN are inclusive of the described dates.  It also strongly suggests that we are using PST times unless a question otherwise mentions. A conflict exists between the date in the question (16 March) and the date in the explanation (14 March).  In such a case, it is highly likely that the \"explanation\" is a typo and will be ignored for purposes of resolution. On that basis, my best guess is that the GJO interpretation will be that the submission WAS before the deadline. However, the submission is of dubious legality, as (if I understand correctly) the Philippines Senate needs to, but has not, ratified the withdrawal.  So has the PHILIPPINES submitted written notification, or has PRESIDENT DUTERTE? My best guess for GJO's interpretation: though the submission might be rejected on this basis by the UN, or might be subsequently retracted by the Philippines Senate, the adjudicators for this question are likely to recognise Duterte (and the Philippines' ambassador) as duly-appointed officers of the Philippines government, and thus yesterday's actions will count as \"submit written notification\". However, this question will not close and resolve until midnight (PST) tonight (ie. today's forecasts should stand), as there is a (very small) chance a 2nd nation could submit written notification in the next 4 hours! *************************\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\nMinimal either way for me.
