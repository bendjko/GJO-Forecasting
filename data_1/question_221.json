This versatile system can carry a number weapons \u2013 tactical, ballistic missiles or cruise missiles, capable of hitting targets at ranges up to 415 \u2013 500 km, but, according to several sources, a new type of cruise missile designated 9M729 was tested with that system, extending its operational strike range far beyond the parameters allowed by the INF treaty.

new American INF-class missile might play right into Russian hands. The Russians have been trying to maneuver the United States into abrogating the INF treaty first given their own violation of the accord.

The Americans worry restrictions over flights across Kaliningrad Oblast\u2019s airspace, Russia\u2019s westernmost territory, have been applied to conceal the deployment of sophisticated weaponry in the province couched between Poland and Lithuania along the Baltic Sea. \"There have been reports about all kinds of sophisticated radar systems \u2013 air defense, area denial capabilities \u2013 designed to keep NATO warships and airships away,\" Michael Carpenter, former US deputy assistant secretary of defense, told the Manhattan-based newspaper Tuesday. \u201cIf they have that sort of weaponry, we would like to have more transparency about what is there,\" said Carpenter.\n US officials also allege observation flights near Russia\u2019s borders with South Ossetia and Abkhazia have been in restricted in violation of the treaty, according to the WSJ. Comparable restrictions might be placed on Hawaiian and Alaskan airspace, the newspaper reported. Russian officials have been apprised of Washington\u2019s pending restrictions.\n On Tuesday, General Joseph Dunford, US chairman of the Joints Chiefs of Staff, confirmed the US would like to remain a signatory but will scrap it \"if Russia is not in compliance.\"\nKremlin spokesman Dimitry Peskov countered that any and all complaints should be handled professionally in compliance with the treaty.\" Definition:\nFail-Deadly: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-deadly\nFail-deadly is a concept in nuclear military strategy that encourages deterrence by guaranteeing an immediate, automatic, and overwhelming response to an attack. The term fail-deadly was coined as a contrast to fail-safe.\nFail-deadly operation is an example of second-strike strategy, in that aggressors are discouraged from attempting a first strike attack. Under fail-deadly nuclear deterrence, policies and procedures controlling the retaliatory strike authorize launch even if the existing command and control structure has already been neutralized by a first strike. The deterrent efficacy of such a system clearly depends on other nuclear-armed nations' having foreknowledge of it. The Soviet Union used a fail-deadly system known as Dead Hand (codenamed \"Perimeter\"); it is not certain if Russia still uses it.\nFail-deadly can refer to specific technology components, or the controls system as a whole. The United Kingdom's fail-deadly policies delegated strike authority to submarine commanders in the event of a loss of command (using a letter of last resort), ensuring that even when uncoordinated, nuclear retaliation could be carried out.\nAn example of the implementation of such a strategy could be: Ballistic missile submarines are ordered to surface at periodic intervals to receive communications indicating that no change has occurred in the defense condition. Should the submarines be unable to receive the proper command and control signals indicating normal, peacetime conditions, their orders would be to launch their nuclear missiles under the assumption that command and control structures had been destroyed in a nuclear attack and that retaliation was therefore necessary. All available means of verification and all due caution would naturally be applied. This approach is obviously exceptionally dangerous for a variety of reasons. The strategy's true value is in deterrence against attack on command, control, communications, and computer (see C4I) networks by any potential adversary.\nFail-deadly is also associated with massive retaliation, a deterrence strategy which ensures that the counterstrike will be conducted on a larger scale than the initial attack.\nA dead man's switch can be used as a fail-deadly instrument, for instance a switch which must be constantly held to prevent the triggering of an explosive. This would ensure that a suicide bombing is not prevented by killing the person that has the bomb.\"\nSource: Wikipedia Affirming forecast."], [368, "2017-09-30T20:55:38Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-09-30T07:16:13Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-09-29T20:08:46Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-09-29T18:32:33Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-09-29T18:17:16Z", [0.0], ""], [39740, "2017-09-28T22:16:01Z", [0.3], ""], [691, "2017-09-28T20:39:01Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-09-28T19:51:56Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-09-27T21:17:31Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-09-27T04:25:47Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-09-26T19:56:38Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-09-26T18:18:26Z", [0.0], ""], [12828, "2017-09-26T17:19:41Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-09-25T18:28:41Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-09-25T17:28:11Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-09-25T01:15:10Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-09-24T19:18:51Z", [0.0], ""], [10745, "2017-09-24T17:29:35Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-09-24T15:46:44Z", [0.0], ""], [39997, "2017-09-24T00:26:13Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-09-23T20:45:07Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-09-23T12:54:27Z", [0.0], ""], [35636, "2017-09-23T05:40:16Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-09-23T05:36:04Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-09-22T20:54:54Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-09-22T20:39:53Z", [0.0], ""], [40124, "2017-09-22T16:32:31Z", [1.0], ""], [691, "2017-09-21T22:56:27Z", [0.0], ""], [601, "2017-09-21T21:54:57Z", [0.01], ""], [39835, "2017-09-21T20:11:05Z", [1.0], ""], [39724, "2017-09-21T19:58:13Z", [0.0], ""], [39938, "2017-09-21T19:48:24Z", [0.05], ""], [39847, "2017-09-21T19:20:40Z", [1.0], ""], [39792, "2017-09-21T19:00:58Z", [0.05], ""], [39859, "2017-09-21T18:57:07Z", [0.0], ""], [39620, "2017-09-21T18:49:18Z", [0.0], ""], [39665, "2017-09-21T18:41:29Z", [0.0], ""], [39715, "2017-09-21T18:29:16Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-09-21T18:28:24Z", [0.0], ""], [39562, "2017-09-21T18:12:17Z", [0.3], ""], [39284, "2017-09-21T17:26:40Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-09-20T19:59:41Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-09-20T19:56:33Z", [0.0], ""], [32258, "2017-09-20T16:22:25Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-09-20T05:04:14Z", [0.0], ""], [3363, "2017-09-19T18:39:49Z", [0.03], ""], [368, "2017-09-19T18:37:15Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-09-18T19:34:55Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-09-18T15:03:26Z", [0.0], ""], [1333, "2017-09-18T08:47:44Z", [0.05], ""], [1034, "2017-09-18T04:42:51Z", [0.0], ""], [6303, "2017-09-18T04:31:38Z", [0.0], "Based on general news and GJP consensus."], [484, "2017-09-17T22:30:37Z", [0.02], "(no change) What would Russia do if DT throws a bone to the neocons who haven't met a treaty they like?

The United States, in order to bring Russia back into compliance, will have to adopt strategies that are specifically tailored to the conditions that exist today\u2014conditions that include possible NATO reluctance to host new nuclear-capable weapons systems and Putin\u2019s aggressive approach to foreign affairs.\nOne possible approach involves capitalizing on Russia\u2019s refusal to admit that it is in violation of the treaty, despite its having been presented with evidence of the infraction\u2014and Moscow\u2019s preference, if the treaty is indeed to fail, that blame land on the United States. Unfortunately, that is precisely where blame would land if Washington were to develop an intermediate-range missile system that, if tested and deployed, would violate the treaty. If, on the other hand, the United States shared with its allies indisputable evidence of Russia\u2019s violation, pressure on Moscow to come back into compliance would mount. In addition to publicizing Russia\u2019s violation, the United States should also offer Russia a way to save face and return to compliance without having to admit a violation.\nIf the time ever comes for the United States to remind Russia just how much it hated the deployment of US missiles in Europe, it could do so without violating the INF Treaty. Steven Pifer, a non-resident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has suggested that the United States could deploy additional conventional air- and sea-launched cruise missiles to Europe. These systems exhibit several advantages: They would not violate the INF Treaty, which only covers ground-based systems; they are already in the US arsenal; and they would be easy to remove if Russia returned to compliance.\nThe original negotiations toward the INF Treaty offer valuable lessons about handling Russia\u2019s violation of the agreement\u2014but simply matching Russia\u2019s violation with a new violation is not a viable solution. Negotiations succeed and fail for a number of complex reasons, including who is in power, who is at the table, and how the international community views (and whether it supports) the negotiations. To save the INF Treaty, the United States must develop strategies that both acknowledge\u2014and take advantage of\u2014circumstances that exist today.\"\n"], [368, "2017-09-16T21:42:06Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-09-16T14:53:34Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-09-15T20:30:56Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-09-15T19:57:36Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-09-14T20:30:26Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-09-14T20:26:24Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-09-14T02:11:40Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-09-13T20:39:08Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-09-13T01:21:17Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-09-12T17:50:45Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-09-11T20:22:22Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-09-10T19:55:03Z", [0.0], ""], [755, "2017-09-10T18:25:13Z", [0.01], "Comments: Forget carriers.

It is also known as 55R6M \"Triumfator-M.\"\nThe S-500 is a new generation surface-to-air missile system. It is designed for intercepting and destroying intercontinental ballistic missiles as well as hypersonic cruise missiles and aircraft, for air defense against Airborne Early Warning and Control, and for jamming aircraft. With a planned range of 600 km (370 mi) for Anti Ballistic Missile (ABM) and 400 km (250 mi) for the air defense, the S-500 would be able to detect and simultaneously engage up to 10 ballistic supersonic targets flying at a speed of 5 kilometres per second (3.1 mi/s; 18,000 km/h; 11,000 mph)[5][6] to a limit of 7 km/s (4.3 mi/s; 25,000 km/h; 16,000 mph). It also aims at destroying hypersonic cruise missiles and other aerial targets at speeds of higher than Mach 5 as well as spacecraft. The altitude of a target engaged can be as high as 180\u2013200 km (110\u2013120 mi). It is effective against ballistic missiles with a launch range of 3,500 km (2,200 mi), the radar reaches a radius of 3,000 km (1,300 km for the EPR 0,1 square meter).\nThe system will be highly mobile and will have rapid deployability. Experts believe that the system's capabilities can affect enemy intercontinental ballistic missiles at the middle and end portions of flight, but reports by Almaz-Antey say that the external target designation system (RLS Voronezh-DM and missile defense system A-135 radar Don-2N) will be capable of mid-early flight portion interceptions of enemy ballistic missiles, which is one of the final stages of the S-500 project.\" \"Five batteries of S-500 missiles are planned to be in service by 2020. The S-500s will work with S-400s and will replace S-300 air defence missiles. The Russian military will start deploying S-500 missile systems in 2016, with a total of 10 batteries to be ordered. The first units will be deployed around Moscow and the country's central area. The targets it will defend against include: ballistic missiles, hypersonic cruise missiles, unmanned aerial vehicles, low-orbit satellites, and space weapons launched from hypersonic aircraft, drones, and hypersonic orbital platforms. A naval version is the likely armament for the new Leader-class air-defense destroyers due to enter service in 2023-25.\nResponse time of less than 4 seconds (S-400 less than 10).\"\nSource: Wikipedia WaayTV, April 6, 'As America's ICBM defense system gets ready for first ever full-scale test in May, new report calls for increased funding': http://www.waaytv.com/redstone_alabama/as-america-s-icbm-defense-system-gets-ready-for-first/article_49c4f666-1b27-11e7-b029-b3f11e0dc44f.html Ground-Based Midcourse Defense: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground-Based_Midcourse_Defense\nGround-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) is the United States' anti-ballistic missile system for intercepting incoming warheads in space, during the midcourse phase of ballistic trajectory flight. It is a major component of the American missile defense strategy to counter ballistic missiles, including intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) carrying nuclear, chemical, biological or conventional warheads. GMD is administered by the U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA), while the operational control and execution is provided by the U.S. Army, and support functions are provided by the U.S. Air Force. Previously known as National Missile Defense (NMD), the name was changed in 2002 to differentiate it from other U.S. missile defense programs, such as space-based and sea-based intercept programs, or defense targeting the boost phase and reentry flight phases.\" Source: Wikipedia Breaking Defense, April 7, 'Austal Pushes Big Missiles For Small Ships: LCS & VLS': http://breakingdefense.com/2017/04/austal-pushes-big-missiles-for-small-ships-lcs-vls/ Breaking Defense, March 13, 'Army\u2019s Multi-Domain Battle Gains Traction Across Services: The Face Of Future War': http://breakingdefense.com/2017/03/armys-multi-domain-battle-gains-traction-across-services/\nClip from above Defense article:\n\"In fact, there\u2019s already at least one weapon in the works directly inspired by Multi-Domain Battle: a version of the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMs) modified to strike ships at sea.

Mark Milley have called for the Army to sink ships, and the Marines are interested as well. That\u2019s a capability the ground services have lacked since the Coastal Artillery disbanded in 1950. Reviving it in the form of long-range precision missiles is the most dramatic and tangible example of the kind of change Multi-Domain Battle can bring \u2014 but it\u2019s far from the only one.\nHarris has also called for the Army and Navy to link their separate missile defense networks.

That will be extremely dangerous\u201d with the possibility of miscalculation in a crisis by either side. Even in a world with a number of nations possessing nuclear weapons, there would be no treaty between the holders of 90 percent of those strategic weapons that control their placement or size of their stockpiles, he said.\nIgor Ivanov, a former Russian foreign minister and now president of the Russia International Affairs Council, said the relationship \u201calmost brings to life old ghosts of the Cold War\u201d where there were no agreements. Instead there was a philosophy of Mutually Assured Destruction as warding off nuclear catastrophe.\n\u201cU.S.-Russian dialogue on nuclear weapons has to be resumed\u201d or it sends a signal to other nations that Moscow and Washington are not concerned about their placement, numbers or possible proliferation to other countries.\n\u201cWe cannot postpone solutions\u201d on large issues such as Ukraine, nuclear weapons, weaponization of cyber and space and smaller issues like cooperation in the Arctic, business and economic ties even in the face of sanctions, or cultural and scientific exchanges.\n\u201cThere is no alternative to cooperation,\u201d Ivanov said.\nDetails on how to approach these issues will be in the soon to be released \u201cRoadmap for U.S.-Russia Relations.\u201d The project of finding ways to rebuild trust began in 2015.\nOleg Stepanov, director of the planning department in Russia\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs, said. \u201cMore friendship [between leaders] brought us to a cautionary tale\u201d that there were not enough ties to sustain a relationship. \u201cThe building was too flimsy to survive.\u201d\nThe \u201cgreat mistake\u201d of the last few years \u201chas been continued sniping at each other,\u201d rather than expanding dialogue and listening to each other.

It was designed for extended range anti-air warfare (ER-AAW) purposes providing capability against fixed and rotary-wing aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, and anti-ship cruise missiles in flight, both over sea and land. It can also be used as a high speed anti-ship missile. The missile uses the airframe of the earlier SM-2ER Block IV (RIM-156A) missile, adding the active radar homing seeker from the AIM-120C AMRAAM in place of the semi-active seeker of the previous design. This will improve the capability of the Standard missile against highly agile targets, and targets beyond the effective range of the launching vessels' target illumination radars. Initial operating capability was planned for 2013 and was achieved on November 27, 2013. The SM-6 is not meant to replace the SM-2 series of missiles, but will serve alongside and provide extended range and increased firepower. It was approved for export in January 2017.\nSource: Wikipedia"], [691, "2017-03-16T12:38:25Z", [0.02], ""], [1034, "2017-03-16T05:46:49Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-03-16T00:57:17Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-03-15T05:58:10Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-03-14T18:15:17Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-03-14T17:42:32Z", [0.04], ""], [1034, "2017-03-14T05:12:00Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-03-13T23:28:21Z", [0.0], ""], [4273, "2017-03-13T19:17:10Z", [0.2], ""], [30400, "2017-03-13T08:28:42Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-03-13T05:14:54Z", [0.0], ""], [30396, "2017-03-13T00:26:14Z", [0.25], ""], [4273, "2017-03-12T23:35:00Z", [0.25], ""], [368, "2017-03-12T21:45:15Z", [0.0], ""], [34323, "2017-03-12T19:43:11Z", [0.25], ""], [10692, "2017-03-12T18:35:23Z", [0.0], ""], [32122, "2017-03-12T16:08:40Z", [0.0], "Hard to see what they gain by overtly withdrawing.

The Kh-101 uses GLONASS, the Russian satellite navigation system, for trajectory correction and is reported to have an accuracy of five to six meters.\nThe Kh-101 is likely meant to replace the Kh-55, a subsonic air-launched cruise missile which has been in service since 1983.\" Comments: Check out the range of this puppy.

Located in the Pushkino district of Moscow it is a quadrangular truncated pyramid 33 metres (108 ft) tall with sides 130 metres (427 ft) long at the bottom, and 90 metres (295 ft) long at the top. Each of its four faces has an 18 metres (59 ft) diameter Ultra high frequency band radar giving 360 degree coverage. The system is run by an Elbrus-2 (Russian: \u042d\u043b\u044c\u0431\u0440\u0443\u0441-2) supercomputer.\nIt has a range of 3700 km for targets the size of a typical ICBM warhead.\nUnder the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty both the United States and the Soviet Union had to designate one area to protect from missile attack. The USA chose North Dakota and the Soviet Union chose Moscow.

The development of the MIRV technology is reported to be in response to the deployment of the United States national missile defense system which degrades China's nuclear deterrence capability.

Classifying ballistic missiles by range is done mostly for convenience, in principle there is very little difference between a low-performance ICBM and a high-performance IRBM. The range definition used here is used within the U.S. Missile Defense Agency. Some other sources include an additional category, the long-range ballistic missile (LRBM), to describe missiles with a range between IRBMs and true ICBMs. The more modern term theater ballistic missile encompasses MRBMs and SRBMs, including any ballistic missile with a range under 3,500 km (2,175 mi).\nIRBMs are currently operated by the People's Republic of China, India, Israel, and possibly North Korea. The United States, USSR, United Kingdom, and France were former operators. Source: Wikipedia Comments: Wouldn't surprise me if the SS-26 is already easily upgradable for longer ranges.

The foundation took a leading role in the conservative movement during the presidency of Ronald Reagan, whose policies were taken from Heritage's policy study Mandate for Leadership. Heritage has since continued to have a significant influence in U.S. public policy making, and is considered to be one of the most influential conservative research organizations in the United States. After the 2016 election of Donald Trump as U.S. President, Heritage played a major role in shaping his transition team.

It\u2019s expected to dock in Kaliningrad today with its alarming cargo.\nThe Iskander-M system, called SS-26 by NATO, is the replacement of the Scud missile of American Gulf War memory. It has a range of 300 miles and can carry either a conventional or a nuclear warhead. An Iskander-M based in Kaliningrad can strike targets deep in Poland and across the whole Baltic region. Make no mistake, this is primarily an offensive weapons system.\nThere\u2019s a reason that the Kremlin promised to not ship this missile system to Kaliningrad back in 2009, in exchange for President Obama\u2019s scuppering of missile defense in Poland and the Czech Republic. Activating an Iskander-M unit in Kaliningrad, west of the Baltic republics, is rightly seen as destabilizing by NATO\u2019s whole eastern flank which, despite security promises by the White House, remains vulnerable to Russian attack.

Russia\u2019s power projection in these regions has been further extended by the deployment of the S-400 air defense system to Crimea in August 2016 and to Syria in November 2015. Advanced air defense systems create A2AD \u201cbubbles\u201d that prevent Russia\u2019s opponents from establishing air supremacy in strategically significant theaters. The Baltic States, much of Ukraine and the Black Sea, northern Poland, Syria and parts of Turkey fall under Russian A2AD bubbles created by S-300 and S-400 air defense systems. Russia operates advanced air defense not only within its own territory, but from sites in Syria and occupied Crimea, as well as cooperatively through the Joint Air Defense Network in Belarus and Armenia. Russia can use these systems to impede the ability of the U.S. to defend its NATO allies by disrupting the ability of US air forces to access conflict zones in the event of a crisis.

It is impossible to know how sincere the Russians are about this fear, but they say it a lot. And it certainly helps raise concern about what might be going on at Deveselu, which makes Putin happy.\nThe whole thing reads like a pretty classic Russian disinformation operation. A few anonymous sources make a claim in an obscure foreign newspaper. That allows Russia\u2019s state media to \u201ccover\u201d the allegations without quite taking responsibility for them. The story gets redistributed by the usual nitwits \u2014 looking at you, Breitbart! \u2014 and useful idiots connect the dots for Moscow. And, thanks to the geniuses in the Defense Department\u2019s press shop who \u201cneither confirm nor deny\u201d any story about the location of U.S. nuclear weapons, Russian media are having a ball.\" Even if Russia is paranoid, the increasing performance of missile defense interceptors means that the missiles could also be used to attack ground targets. I asked my friend David Wright to model an SM-3 Block IIB interceptor based in Poland converted to a nuclear weapon, and, sure enough, it would violate the 1987 INF Treaty and pose a threat to Moscow.\nAs far as I can tell, no one in the United States is planning to do this, but one reason the Russians may be suspicious is that they may be thinking about it themselves. John Krempasky likes to say the easiest way to figure out what the Russians are up to is to look at what they are accusing the United States of doing. He has a point. Many countries have adapted surface-to-air missiles to have surface-to-surface roles, including Russia and the United States. Some foreign observers are already warning that it is Russia that is planning on converting its most advanced air defense missiles into intermediate-range nuclear weapons.\" Comments: Clinton in the WH will only fuel this paranoia.

To begin with, there is Russia\u2019s violation of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty by testing a ground-launched cruise missile to intermediate range. While such a missile likely will not pose a direct threat to the United States, it constitutes a treaty violation and would threaten U.S. allies, as well as other countries, in Europe and Asia. The outside world has less visibility regarding Russia\u2019s nonstrategic arsenal than Russia\u2019s strategic forces. It appears, however, that the military has developed a range of nonstrategic nuclear capabilities, including cruise missiles, short-range ballistic missiles and aircraft. By contrast, the United States has steadily reduced the number and types of weapons in its nonstrategic nuclear arsenal, which now consists solely of the B61 nuclear bomb. Of particular concern is Russia\u2019s apparent focus on low-yield nuclear weapons\u2014which one official has referred to as a \u201cnuclear scalpel\u201d\u2014coupled with its nuclear \u201cde-escalation\u201d doctrine. That doctrine envisages escalating to de-escalate, that is, using low-yield nuclear weapons as a means to terminate a conventional conflict on terms favorable to the Kremlin. Russia\u2019s unclassified national security strategy says that nuclear weapons would be used only in the event of an attack with weapons of mass destruction on Russia or one of its allies, or in the event of an attack on Russia with conventional forces in which the fate of the state is at stake. The \u201cde-escalation\u201d doctrine, Putin\u2019s references to nuclear weapons in his public statements and the broad modernization of Russia\u2019s nonstrategic nuclear forces suggest that the classified strategy could envisage use of those weapons in wider circumstances. That risks lowering the nuclear threshold. And once a nuclear weapon\u2014any nuclear weapon\u2014is used, the possibility of catastrophic escalation would increase dramatically. Nuclear Triad: \n\u201cA nuclear triad refers to the nuclear weapons delivery of a strategic nuclear arsenal which consists of three components, traditionally strategic bombers, intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), and submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). The purpose of having a three-branched nuclear capability is to significantly reduce the possibility that an enemy could destroy all of a nation's nuclear forces in a first-strike attack; this, in turn, ensures a credible threat of a second strike, and thus increases a nation's nuclear deterrence.\u201d https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_triad 5) RU asymmetric warfare strategy. \nAsymmetric Warfare\n\u201cAsymmetric warfare (or Asymmetric engagement) is war between belligerents whose relative military power differs significantly, or whose strategy or tactics differ significantly. This is typically a war between a standing, professional army and an insurgency or resistance movement. Asymmetric warfare can describe a conflict in which the resources of two belligerents differ in essence and in the struggle, interact and attempt to exploit each other's characteristic weaknesses. Such struggles often involve strategies and tactics of unconventional warfare, the weaker combatants attempting to use strategy to offset deficiencies in quantity or quality. Such strategies may not necessarily be militarized. This is in contrast to symmetric warfare, where two powers have similar military power and resources and rely on tactics that are similar overall, differing only in details and execution.\u201d https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_warfare 6) While the RU economy is weak, this has not stopped Putin from pursuing aggressive policies: Stratfor, July 12, \u2018U.S. Nuclear Overtures Would Likely Fall on Deaf Ears\u2019: https://www.stratfor.com/geopolitical-diary/us-nuclear-overtures-would-likely-fall-deaf-ears-0\nClips from Stratfor article:\n\u201cDespite the current treaty, Russia's ever-changing military doctrine continues to prioritize the country's nuclear forces and willingness to strike first \u2014 a change from Soviet policy. Its present doctrine, drawn up by Medvedev in 2009, resembles the aggressive doctrines of the 1960s and 1970s under Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid Brezhnev as Russia settled into a prolonged Cold War with the West. In recent months, Russia has been restructuring its military forces in its Western Military District, while during the weekend, NATO agreed to expand its forces in the east. Moscow is keenly aware of its overall conventional military weakness compared with NATO, particularly as Russia's defense funding continues to grow tight. So its long-term strategy will be to lean on its powerful nuclear arsenal as the ultimate deterrent. Russia is considering moving nuclear-capable missiles to Kaliningrad, near the Baltic-Polish borders, and to Crimea, the former Ukrainian territory on the Black Sea. But even if the United States were to follow Obama's dream of initiating global arms control, Russia couldn't simply back down \u2014 it has other nuclear rivals, such as China, to worry about. For the United States, China is still a nascent nuclear power with limited mobility. But for Russia, which shares more than 4,000 kilometers (about 2,500 miles) of border with China, mobility is not an issue. In addition, in its recent Defense White Papers, Russia has expanded the conditions under which it would be willing to use nuclear weapons to include non-nuclear adversaries, such as invading armies.\u201d Source: Wikipedia\n"], [368, "2016-07-22T19:29:45Z", [0.01], ""], [27666, "2016-07-22T10:38:07Z", [0.0], ""], [12302, "2016-07-21T17:09:11Z", [0.05], ""], [12302, "2016-07-21T17:08:56Z", [0.07], ""], [368, "2016-07-21T16:45:10Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2016-07-20T22:03:41Z", [0.01], ""], [691, "2016-07-20T16:43:25Z", [0.1], ""], [6600, "2016-07-20T02:24:45Z", [0.0], ""], [484, "2016-07-19T23:27:30Z", [0.25], "(no change) I didn't see anything in the US Republican party platform: https://prod-static-ngop-pbl.s3.amazonaws.com/media/documents/DRAFT_12_FINAL[1]-ben_1468872234.pdf addressing either the INF or New START."], [368, "2016-07-19T19:51:57Z", [0.0], ""], [484, "2016-07-19T02:53:23Z", [0.25], "Down 5% since the consensus is dropping.

He is unlikely to significantly abandon these treaties. (Unless he has a solid expectation of being able to quickly re-frame various details of them to his advantage or he sees them as being irrelevant based on new grand military moves.) He is almost certain to officially threaten to do so and in fact has already raised such threats. These treaties are almost a virtual reality analogue to the weapons themselves. The threats of using nuclear weapons as with the threat of leaving the treaties are more machivellian weapons than the actual execution.  I think there remains a small but very real chance Putin will go very large very fast - invade more of eastern Europe beyond Ukraine or make a new large scale intervention into the middle east for example, during the gap between US election and inauguration. This raises the real but minuscule specter of dissolving the nuclear treaties de facto - by deploying nuclear weapons.  I have to put a 2% chance on it just to identify a genuine panapoly of threat.
