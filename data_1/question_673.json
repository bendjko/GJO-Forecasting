While both teams have their dedicated fan bases, it's not necessarily a must-watch match-up. Beyond the normal Sunday programming, there's the Season Finale of the The Deuce on HBO (season finales tend to draw more viewership from what I can tell). But perhaps more importantly, and what is most affecting my forecast, is that Game 5 of the World Series is scheduled for Sunday night at the same time. Looking at the viewership of the World Series, comparing that to the viewership of SNF, and recognizing that some of those same sports fans will have to choose between the two programs, I think SNF ends up losing viewership. After all, it's just Week 8 in the NFL, and while both teams are playing to improve their divisional rankings and thus guarantee a playoff spot, it will not likely compete with the championship series for the MLB. And Game 5 could be the deciding game if either LA or Houston sweep the other in Games 3 and 4 (series tied at 1-1).  So yeah, the World Series will pull viewership away from SNF, which will already be competing with the normal Sunday night programming."], [12879, "2017-10-27T17:07:12Z", [0.01, 0.01, 0.23, 0.25, 0.5], ""]], "open_date": "2017-10-27T17:00:14Z", "close_date": "2017-10-30T06:59:14Z"}
