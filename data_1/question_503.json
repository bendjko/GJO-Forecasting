When a whole people have been subjected to ethnic cleansing all the way to holocaust, they get really, really determined. Similarly, consider these issues for the Kurds:\n* Ongoing ethnic cleansing including razing of entire cities in Turkey\n* Saddam Hussein's ethnic cleansing with wholesale gassing of entire cities\n* ISIS's war on \"heretics\" such as the Kurds (Yazidis being among the Kurdish peoples) leading them to slaughter all \"heretic\" adult men and enslave or murder their women and children, subjecting even children to rape as a stated religious/ideological goal.\n* Recent news of Israel and Kurdistan possibly forging an alliance. Note: Israel has plenty of nuclear weapons and the means to employ them in defense of the Kurds. So amid all this finger wagging by Turkey, the U.S., Iran, Iraq's central government -- how much leverage do these nay sayers have?  Turkey already is killing and imprisoning Kurds and razing their cities, and infiltrating troops into Iraq. What worse could they do? The U.S. won't dare participate in slaughtering Kurds because (1) they are our best allies in fighting ISIS; (2) They fight like Israelis, including their women, and we know how that went when Israel's neighbors have invaded even though this was before their nuclear weapons existed; (3) Kurds have lots of political support int he U.S., including among Trump's base. Iran won't invade Kurdistan because (1) this would risk massive uprising in its Kurd-dominated region; (2) this would risk direct military conflict with the U.S.; (3) Sanctions might return, at least on the U.S. side.

Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani, the commander of Iran\u2019s powerful Quds Force, and Brett McGurk, the US special anti-IS envoy accompanied by US Ambassador Douglas Silliman, were shuttling this week between Baghdad, Erbil and Sulaimaniyah to convince all sides to come to an agreement. \"Both the Iranians and the Americans were in agreement about the referendum and reiterated that it should not take place,\" a source briefed about the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan\u2019s (PUK) separate meetings with American and Iranian officials on Sept. 11 told Al-Monitor. Both Iran and the United States also separately conveyed similar messages to Gorran movement officials. The latter believe that the referendum should be postponed until regional and international support is secured. \"We will not support you, and you will be on your own,\" a Gorran official told Al-Monitor when recounting a meeting with the American ambassador. Indeed, \u201cThe United States is 100% opposed to the referendum on September 25,\u201d Weshyar Omar, who was part of the Gorran delegation meeting with the Americans on Sept. 13, quoted McGurk as saying. \"Until now, we have held back the [Hashid Shaabi, or Popular Mobilization Units (PMU)] from attacking, but I will not bother to do that anymore,\" Soleimani warned the senior PUK officials, the source briefed on the meeting told Al-Monitor. \"Just look at Mandali and what happened there. That is the beginning,\" he cautioned, referring to the Sept. 11 incident in which a group of over a hundred Iranian-backed Iraqi militia fighters arrived in the disputed subdistrict of Mandali in Diyala province, 100 kilometers (62 miles) northeast of Baghdad, and forced the Kurdish head of the town\u2019s council out of his job and announced that the town will not be included in the Kurdistan referendum. The incident came three days after Hadi Ameri, the head of the Badr Brigade \u2014 an important component of the PMU \u2014 warned that Iraq will stay united and if the Kurdistan referendum went ahead it could create a civil war in the country. In a direct challenge to the Kurds, on Sept. 12 and 13 respectively, Diyala and Salahuddin provincial councils canceled the plans to hold the referendum in disputed areas within their provincial boundaries. -- http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/09/iran-us-kurdistan-referendum-soleimani-mcgurk-barzani.html#ixzz4sluce62n"], [14880, "2017-09-15T16:04:10Z", [0.95, 0.0, 0.05], ""], [1333, "2017-09-15T15:25:46Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [4273, "2017-09-15T13:26:29Z", [0.75, 0.0, 0.25], ""], [28414, "2017-09-15T09:08:06Z", [0.63, 0.0, 0.37], ""], [68, "2017-09-15T07:06:12Z", [0.85, 0.0, 0.15], "http://www.kurdistan24.net/en/video/eb66278b-ac31-4945-8d49-d5d3302c7e3e The pressure is on. \"ERBIL, Kurdistan Region (Kurdistan 24) \u2013 The United States has proposed an \u201calternative path\u201d to the Kurdistan Region\u2019s upcoming independence referendum, a senior US official, Brett McGurk, US Special Presidential Envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter the Islamic State (IS), explained at the end of a visit in Erbil......On Thursday, less than two weeks before the scheduled vote, McGurk publicly discussed the plan, although without providing any details........His subsequent remarks suggest the plan failed to address Kurdish concerns. \u201cIf the only aim is to postpone the referendum, the postponement will never happen,\u201d President Barzani said in Zakho, after meeting with the group of diplomats.\""], [4634, "2017-09-15T05:31:43Z", [0.65, 0.03, 0.32], "http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/09/iran-us-kurdistan-referendum-soleimani-mcgurk-barzani.html"], [37609, "2017-09-15T03:17:57Z", [0.7, 0.0, 0.3], "It's not up to Barzini to decide if the referendum is held or not.

The vote is \u201cdefinitely happening\u201d on Sept. 25, Kirkuk Governor Najmuddin Kareem told Reuters after a majority of the provincial council voted in favor of taking part. Only 24 of the 41 council members attended Tuesday\u2019s vote, with 23 voting in favor of participating in the referendum.

Unrest is growing in Iraq as the Kurdish referendum grows nearer. Soon, the Iraq that we have known since the end of WWII could be drawing new borders. At the same time, the conflict between the Shi\u2019a (supported by Iran) and the Sunni (Saudi-UAE) could be heating up again. Regional actors and political friction have added fuel to the fire, in the first signs that the strong Shi\u2019a majority is experiencing internal instability. One of the main leaders of the region\u2019s Shi\u2019a has broken ranks in Iran\u2019s Shi\u2019a led government factions just as Sunni power players in the Arab Gulf are expecting a collapse of the Shi\u2019a power triangle of Iran-Iraq-Syria. The unexpected visit of Shi\u2019ite cleric and power broker Muqtada Al Sadr to Saudi Arabia and the UAE has stirred unrest in the region. On the 30th of July, Al Sadr and Saudi crown prince Mohammed Bin Salman met in Jeddah, discussing possible cooperation between the Sunni Wahhabi Kingdom and Shi\u2019a led Iraq. Al Sadr\u2019s meeting with MBS is significant, as it could lead to a change in Iraq\u2019s pro-Iran political military position. This would signal a major success for the anti-Iran GCC front, but it would put severe pressure on Tehran in its quest to construct a Shi\u2019a land bridge between Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon. A political thaw between Baghdad and Riyadh has occurred in recent months with a number of high-ranking ministers and officials meeting regularly. Still, official diplomatic relations remain very cold (para. 1-5). Still, the September 25 non-binding referendum could be a watershed in Kurdish and Iraqi politics. Until now, the Kurdish region has been one of the most tranquil regions in Iraq, when not taking into account the harsh military operations against Daesh around Mosul. The semi-autonomous Kurdish nation has also established trade and economic relations with Turkey and Iran (para 16). In the Iraqi constitution, supported by the U.S. after 2003, Kurdistan has received a semi-autonomous status. As in the whole region, political powers are tribe or family related, resulting in power politics and corruption. The Barzani-Talabani rule is no different from other parts in the Middle East. Kurdish politics are ruled by the two former Peshmerga leaders, now dividing the Kurdish arena between themselves. Since October 2015, the Kurdish Parliament has not met while Kurdish president Masoud Barzani has overstayed his tenure by four years. The economic situation is slightly depressed, largely due to declining oil and gas revenues, a conflict with the Baghdad government about financial disbursements of revenues and a rising debt portfolio (para 16-17).

Once ISIS is militarily defeated, I'm thinking that Iraq & Syria will turn their militarys against the Kurds and shrink the area under Kurdish control.

While outside pressure to stop the controversial referendum has been constant, the deadliest blow might, however, come from within. Ordinary Kurds, in particular those in Sulaimaniyah, are angry about the government's mismanagement of the economy, and many appear ready to express their dissatisfaction in their approach to the referendum.

Those interviewed include police officers, teachers, peshmerga, shopkeepers, taxi drivers and civil servants, the overwhelming majority of whom reject the referendum outright. They consider it a ploy by the current leadership to distract attention from its failure to efficiently run the government and manage the economy for the last 25 years, since the establishment of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in 1992. Sulaimaniyah, nestled between several mountain ranges, is the largest province in the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, the other two being Dahuk and Erbil. Sulaimaniyah is home to around 2 million of the region's total indigenous population of 5.2 million people. The anger and frustration among them is palpable. \u201cWhy should I vote yes in the referendum?\u201d Shaho Mahyaddin, a father of two, asked rhetorically. \u201cAfter 17 years of being a traffic police officer, what do I have? No electricity. No water. I have no house or investment. I have nothing. The only thing I had was my salary [$980 a month], but over the last two years, they have cut it by more than 30%. How can I feed two children on that amount?\"  Reeling from low oil prices, the KRG last year resorted to cutting the salaries of public sector employees \u2014 a bloated 1.4 million-person workforce \u2014 by up to 65% to counter the economic meltdown. The move had serious adverse effects for the economy, including a decline in purchasing power. Traders in the bazaar, already hit hard by the economic crisis, are now also worried about the possible impact of the upcoming referendum. \u201cPeople are buying only essential goods, such as flour and rice, because they are worried about the day after the referendum,\u201d said Dashtawan, an assistant in a shop selling kitchen wares. \u201cThis July was the worst month in terms of trading in the bazaar for me, even worse than when Daesh attacked,\u201d referring to the Islamic State offensive in summer 2014. Dashtawan said that with only few exceptions, the majority of the people he knows in the bazaar are angry about the economy and are very likely to vote no at the polls.  \u201cWe have had this business since 1953, but it has never been this bad,\u201d said Najat, who has worked in his father\u2019s tea house in Sulaimaniyah's main bazaar since he was 15. Najat said his business has been in decline for the last three years, since Baghdad and Erbil began having serious disputes. \u201cI used to sell about 400 teas per day, but now it is around 120,\u201d said Najat, as he poured tea for the only customer in the little tea house. \u201cDespite this, I will vote yes in the referendum, because this is a once in a lifetime chance, and we should not miss it.\u201d Many civil servants have spent their savings since early 2014, when Baghdad refused to disburse Kurdistan's share of funding in the national budget, and salaries were cut. With no social security net, many residents are anxious about the negative impact of the referendum. Teachers are one group that has been particularly hit by the financial crisis, with cuts to their salaries of almost 70%. \u201cI will go to the polls, and I will mark a resolute no,\u201d said Nesar, a primary school teacher from Halabja who has taught for 18 years. \u201cThe government has slashed my salary of $900 by 65%.\u201d When Al-Monitor asked whether he would vote yes if the government reinstated his salary, he responded, \u201cNo, because I have no trust whatsoever in the current leadership.\u201d It is ironic that under the British and other regimes in Iraq, the people of Sulaimaniyah have always been rebellious, including at the forefront of the independence movements, but 25 years of Kurdish rule have turned them against a referendum for independence. During parliamentary elections in September 1930, the Kurds of Sulaimaniyah called on the British government, which held the League of Nations mandate over Iraq, to allow them to create an independent state as a British protectorate so they would not be at the mercy of an Arab king in Baghdad. When the Sulaimaniyah Kurds realized the futility of their effort, anger grew toward the British and what the Kurds saw as their betrayal. Rejecting Baghdad Arab rule, they poured into the streets while most of the rest of Kurdistan remained silent. By the end of election day, 14 residents were dead and many more wounded, killed or injured at the hands of British and Iraqi forces. In the second half of the 20th century, the people of Sulaimaniyah rebelled several more times. Ordinary Kurds were only too happy to name their children after a famous peshmerga commander or a battle that the peshmerga won against the Iraqi army. They have supported the peshmerga with whatever they could, but many are now scratching their heads and looking for answers to what went wrong. These days it is difficult to mention the name of a certain former peshmerga commander turned politician and not elicit a curse from the average Kurd. The people today despise or have no patience for their Kurdish rulers. \u201cThe main problem is the trust between the public and the political elite,\u201d said Abdulbaset Ismail, who fought for four years as a peshmerga commander against the Iraqi army in the 1980s. \u201cWe fought to free the Kurds from the yoke of the Iraqi state, but I never thought we would create this mess.\u201d Ismail, whose nom de guerre in the mountain was Halo Soor, is driving a taxi these days in Erbil and has difficulty making ends meet. He had commanded a unit of 26 peshmerga in the mountains, 24 of whom lost their life fighting the Iraqi army in the pursuit of Kurdish independence. \u201cDon't get me wrong. I am all for independence, but not under the banner of these thieves,\u201d Ismail asserted. Asked if he would vote on Sept. 25, he replied, \u201cI\u2019d rather cut off my index finger than vote in the referendum.\u201d\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  I need to think about this.

Unfortunately, a great deal has changed since then, thanks to war, the U.S. retreat from the region and the Kurds\u2019 own dysfunctions. As the Islamic State slowly crumbles to its south and west, Kurdistan is politically and economically broken. President Masoud Barzani remains in office four years after his term ended, and parliament has not met in almost two years. The government is deeply in debt and can scarcely afford to pay the three-quarters of the workforce who are state employees. The army and security services are divided into rival factions. Barzani\u2019s reaction to this distress has been to schedule a referendum on Kurdish independence for Sept. 25. The initiative has been rejected not just by the Iraqi federal government, but also by Kurdistan\u2019s powerful neighbors Iran and Turkey, as well as the United States. More significantly, it is being viewed even by staunchly pro-independence Kurds as evidence that the region\u2019s politics have reached a dangerous dead end. The referendum is \u201can excuse by Kurdish leaders to remain in power,\u201d says Shaswar Abdulwahid Qadir, the owner of Kurdistan\u2019s independent NRT television network. \u201cThe younger generation doesn\u2019t know anything about their fight in the mountains against Saddam Hussein. So the old leaders need another excuse to run the country for another 26 years.\u201d Those bitter words reflect Qadir\u2019s perspective as one of a rising generation of Kurds \u2014 and Iraqis \u2014 struggling over how to create stable political institutions and a working economy amid the mess of sectarian conflicts, extremist movements and corrupt establishments littered across the post-Islamic State landscape. Their challenge, like it or not, is \u201cnation-building\u201d \u2014 and they desperately need U.S. help (para. 1-5). Diehl, J. (2017).

But Baghdad opposes talk of secession, and with the United States committed to a one-Iraq policy, it\u2019s going to be an uphill fight. Falah Mustafa Bakir, the head of the Kurdistan Regional Government\u2019s Department of Foreign Relations, told Foreign Policy during a visit to Washington that the message he hoped to convey to his American counterparts was that \u201can independent Kurdistan is a solution and not a problem.\u201d \u201cThe United States can play a very important role,\u201d Bakir told FP. \u201cIt has leverage, and it has tools, in order to be the broker \u2026 in bringing Erbil and Baghdad to this process of negotiation.\u201d Iraqi Kurds, who are concentrated in the country\u2019s autonomous northern region, have long chafed under centralized rule. In the 1990s under Saddam Hussein, they were the targets of a genocidal campaign that forced hundreds of thousands of Kurds to flee into the mountains for safety. The 2005 Iraqi Constitution established the autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government, or KRG, which gained international acclaim for the role of its Peshmerga militias in the fight against the Islamic State. But many Kurds believe Baghdad has failed to respect their rights. Under the constitution, the Kurdish region is guaranteed a 17 percent cut of the national budget. But in 2014, following a dispute over oil sales, then-Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki refused to send the requisite payment, sparking a financial crisis (para. 1-6). Allen-Ebrahimian, B. (2017).

Here\u2019s what you need to know. Kaplan and Mardini (2017) June 2, states that: Amid the backdrop of a fight against the Islamic State, the Kurdistan region of Iraq plans to hold an important vote to determine its direction on statehood. Earlier this month, Kurdistan Regional Government President Masoud Barzani announced that a long-awaited referendum on independence would be held Sept. 25, 2017. Importantly, the vote will not only take place within the borders of the Kurdistan region, but also within disputed territories that are now under de facto Kurdish control since their liberation from the Islamic State. Barzani has called for a referendum many times before, but this time an official date has been set and the vote will probably take place. An informal referendum passed overwhelmingly in the Kurdistan region in January 2005, and there is good reason to believe a positive result will be replicated in this year\u2019s official process. A step toward independence The referendum is not equivalent of a declaration of independence. Nor will it trigger any immediate change to the nature of Kurdish sovereignty in northern Iraq, as the vote has neither a legal framework to empower the referendum as a binding measure, nor support from the international community. The referendum will simply ask voters if they want an independent Kurdish state. However, the referendum is a way for Iraqi Kurds to signal their intention to pursue independence more aggressively in a post-Islamic State Iraq, and the vote will likely give Kurds more leverage in that process. Why now? A strategy to solidify territorial gains. The referendum is also viewed as a way for the Kurds to help legitimize their hold on newly gained territory from the fight against the Islamic State. After nearly three years of war, the Kurdistan Region has gained control over many of the disputed territories in contention with the central government in Baghdad, most importantly the oil-rich city of Kirkuk. Knowing that their bargaining position vis-\u00e0-vis Baghdad (and Washington) will diminish once the fight against the Islamic State ends, and with the battle for Mosul reaching its final stages, the Kurds are acting fast to solidify their territorial gains before pressure is refocused to withdraw from those areas. A pro-independence vote in Kurdish-held disputed territories will undermine American and Iraqi efforts to have those territories returned to Iraqi control. Creating future bargaining power The referendum will be used as a mechanism to gain political leverage over Baghdad. Since the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003, Iraq\u2019s divisive sectarian politics sometimes award a united Kurdish front a powerful brokerage role, especially in the high-stakes government formation processes that have followed a national election. However, this influence is limited in the areas of sustainment and enforcement. For example, during the 2010 government formation stalemate, the Kurds backed Nouri al-Maliki for a second term as prime minister in exchange for his agreeing to enforce Kurdish interests. Maliki took the deal and sealed his premiership, but the Kurds could not keep him from reneging on those agreements shortly thereafter (para. 1-7). Kaplan, M., L. & Mardini, R. (2017).

What was his reaction to your announcement? MB: It\u2019s true but we have also discussed this issue previously. I called his excellency Prime Minster Abadi on this specific issue and I explained to him that this referendum is a normal, legal right of our people, and that afterwards we want negotiate the results of the referendum in a peaceful way through dialogue. He had an understanding of that. We told him that we want to solve this issue with Baghdad through peace and not through violence. He was receptive and understanding. He was positive. FP: You mentioned that any move towards independence would be done in a framework of negotiations with Baghdad. In those negotiations, would you settle for anything less than full sovereignty?
