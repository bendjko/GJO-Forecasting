I'm using Presidential polling and making adjustments. Most people, especially these days, vote straight ticket so presidential voles should be a reasonable estimate.  Hillary is polling about 6 points ahead. I estimated gerrymandering based on the 2014 election. In this election, the GOP won 51% of the vote and 57% of the seats, whereas Dems won 45% of the votes and 43% of the seats. This seems like a GOP advantage of 6% I would estimate that contrary to straight ticket voting, there would be some republicans who will vote GOP down ballot but against Trump. I figure 2% adjustment to the GOP. I've noticed a little anti-GOP sentiment among some Trump supporters. I think the actual numbers on this would be low. I put it at 1%. Trump's claim that the election is rigged should depress turnout. I estimate 3%. Hillary had a superior ground game. Normally the two parties both do this and it cancels out. I would estimate this could be 5% at the presidential level, although I don't think it matches up the House of Reps seats, especially because the Dems have not expected to be competitive until later. I put this at 1%. I think Dems have a few low quality candidates in the seat they need to win. This may cost them 1%. Democrats seem to be winning in new voter registrations, although this may not be in the right areas. I put it at 1%. Altogether, this puts Democrats 3% ahead, which is far from the consensus. Perhaps others have seen something I have not. There is also the potential for reactions to Trump's scandals to be delayed and not fully reflected in the polls.

I am struggling a bit  to put my probability estimate here within a coherent framework.  I liked @Marschat 's recent answer on this topic from last week: https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/341473 . I think where I differ vs. the 8% probability they came up with is along 3 key dimensions: 1) baseline numbers of generic democratic advantage seem to be moving a bit (+7% this morning in latest WSJ/NBC poll http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/2016_generic_congressional_vote-5279.html).  This is moving into the zone that PEC estimates is needed for democrats to control the house (http://election.princeton.edu/house-polling-margin/).  Obviously 28 days remaining is an eternity, but that's where we are today. 2) Turnout is obviously one of the key questions in determining here. Trump's recent issues in past couple wks (tape, debates, etc), would seem likely to depress turnout.  I can't quantify it (and would welcome opposing views), but it stands to reason that if folks aren't motivated by top of the ticket, they may be less likely to turn out.  3) Ticket-splitting is another key question (will Conservatives who vote Hillary or Johnson support House R's)? I have long thought the answer is probably \"Yes,\" on basis that I think people are usually pretty rational. The last couple days have raised a related and intriguing question though, which is - will hardcore Trump supporters vote for House R's who are not backing him? He seems to be encouraging them not to in his recent tweets: https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/785854588654092290 . This article sums up status quo before these tweets, including some references that private polling of house GOP members have started seeing some drop-off in down-ticket support: http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/donald-trump-campaign-republicans-229577.  For record, at least ~32 House members are actively not supporting trump, and that doesn't include Paul Ryan who said yesterday morning he won't campaign w/ him and won't defend him (https://twitter.com/Taniel/status/785161346409259008).

His estimate is that they'll need at least a 6% margin due to gerrymandering and geographic clustering of Democrats in urban areas.  This is a surprisingly large margin, but the last few elections have been trending in that direction, so it may be correct, and the polls don't have the Democrats quite reaching that number. In addition, I think we're at the point in the election where the House race ratings are going to be pretty accurate.  However, you only have to go back to 2010 election to find an election where the ratings were significantly off in one direction ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2010#Predictions ).  The Republicans gained about 10 more seats than the average of the ratings suggested they would, including some misses in some districts that were expected to be pretty favorable to Democrats.

But, if Hillary were to maintain her present lead up til November, \"some of the conditions for big democratic gains might start to emerge, and 2016 could turn into a so-called wave election\" (when one party makes big gains across the nation and across the board in the Senate, House, state governments and the presidency).  The article notes that, typically, most of the big waves tend to come at the expense of the president's party, when presidential approval rating is below 50% and they are more likely during midterm elections.  In terms of the effect of Hillary's significant lead over Trump, the article notes that Nixon's huge victory in 1972 didn't give Republicans the House.  Neither Reagan's, nor Bush I or Bill Clinton.  Gains in all those were modest.   Yet, the article says, if Hillary won by 7-8 points, there is a chance the Democrats will retake the House because the relationship between presidential and down-ballot vote is showing to be tightening.  The article also notes that so far, Trump doesn't seem to have done enough damage to the rest of the party to put the House in question.  The Cook Political Report estimated that 36 Republican seats are either toss ups or leaning Republican.  Many GOP voters with reservations about Trump are sticking by their party.   Well-educated white voters, says the article, are supporting Hillary by 12 points, but, among them, the House Republicans still have the edge.

The uneven turnout results in a big Clinton win, with down-ballot voting that also secures the Senate for Democrats. A strategic targeting of congressional races by an emboldened populace wins the House, sealing Democratic control of the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives. \"So goes the pitch of attorney Stephen Schear and filmmaker Theo Schear, who just launched letstakethehouse.org in a bid to take on the toughest piece of the triumvirate puzzle: the House of Representatives.\n. . . \n\"Their group has identified 37 races nationwide that Democrats have a fighting chance to win if they can match or exceed the funding of their Republican rivals. Democratic fundraising deficits range from $60,000 to $1.9 million in the races identified. Thirty wins would take back the House, assuming Democrats hold their current seats. \"Schear joked that the project\u2019s goal to raise $20 million might seem daunting to the group of 20 or so activists that showed up for the first party, a group well below the 1 percent. But the record of people power harnessed by the Bernie Sanders campaign, which raised over $220 million, indicates that small-donation funding of $20 million spread across 37 races (approximately $540,000 each) is possible, if a public already energized by Sanders\u2019 populist appeal buys into the idea.\n. . . \n\"The activists\u2019 targeting strategy takes a page from the Republican super PAC playbook, which makes a practice of targeting vulnerable seats. One of the \u201cLet\u2019s Take the House\u201d candidates, Colleen Deacon, is vying to retake New York\u2019s 24th congressional seat (Syracuse) from Republican John Katko, who benefited from Republican super PAC targeting in the midterm election. New York 2014, a super PAC funded almost exclusively by five millionaires and billionaires, bought Katko a 10-day media blitz in 2014 that secured the seat in a district that had gone solidly for Obama\u2014with double-digit leads\u2014in both the 2008 and 2012 elections. \"While the pro-Obama demographics of the 24th district indicate that Deacon could win back the seat, Katko has $1 million more in the bank in the crucial early days of the campaign. \u201cLet\u2019s Take the House\u201d activists see this as a winnable race if the playing field can be leveled. There are seats like that all over the country, they say, in which Republicans have the advantage only because they have the money. So Schear and friends are raising the call for party time. \u201cIf we can raise enough money to counter the Republicans\u2019 current fundraising edge in swing House races, we can party ourselves into power,\u201d he said.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  This organization is predicated on the belief stated in the last sentence:  that money wins elections.

It acknowledges that it appears unlikely, however, it also describes how the political landscape is changing due to Trump's candidacy.

Yet Issa managed to win with just 51.2 percent of the vote against a little-known, unfunded Democratic challenger, Doug Applegate, who rang up 45.4 percent. Applegate was such a long shot that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the campaign arm of House Democrats, all but ignored his race.

Jeff Denham, R-Turlock (Stanislaus County), received a less comfortable 46.9 percent of the vote in a district Obama also won twice and where Latinos constitute 26 percent of eligible voters. But his second-time Democratic challenger, Michael Eggman, whom Denham defeated by double digits in 2014, fell below 30 percent of the vote. \"Some Democrats think their best target may be Rep.

In the four previous presidential races, only once has an eventual nominee ever led another by a margin that large in the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll. \"Behind Mr. Trump\u2019s deficit lie negative evaluations of him by a series of crucial target groups. They include millennial voters (80 percent unfavorable in Washington Post/ABC News polling this spring), white women (68 percent), Hispanics (85 percent) and white college graduates (74 percent). \"Given current boundaries for House members\u2019 districts, Mr. Wasserman has identified dozens of Republican-held districts with one or more of six \u201crisk factors\u201d that could give Democrats a chance if Mrs. Clinton routs Mr. Trump at the top of the ticket. \"They include the 26 Republican-held districts that Mr. Obama carried in 2012, districts where Latinos and Asians make up at least 20 percent of the electorate and districts where at least 25 percent of adults hold a college degree. \"Forty Republican incumbents have at least three of the six risk factors. Retirements by Republican incumbents have left Democrats in position to compete for an additional 10 seats this fall.\n. . . \n\"Democratic unity, or the lack of it, will play a critical role if Hillary Clinton, as expected, overcomes a feisty challenge from Bernie Sanders. To have a chance at recapturing the House, Mr. Wasserman said, \u201cDemocrats need Bernie to voice strong support for Clinton, and to campaign for her actively in the fall to drive out his voters.\u201d \"Even if he does, House Democrats face an uphill fight. Not since 1980, when Ronald Reagan walloped the Democratic incumbent, Jimmy Carter, has a party gained at least 30 House seats while winning a presidential election. \"Mr. Reagan\u2019s popular-vote margin that year: just under 10 percentage points.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  This piece outlines the very best possible scenario for Ds, based on a 10% gap between Clinton & Trump.

Here's a stab at answering that question. First, the basics: There are 435 Congressional seats with voting rights, though 1 of these seats is currently empty. There are also 6 seats (from the U.S. territories, commonwealths, and the District of Columbia) without voting rights. Since the question is about control over the House, I'll ignore the seats without voting rights. (Sorry, folks. You really should have voting rights, but I can't fix that here.) So, in lieu of further vacancies, a party needs at least 218 seats to control the House. (I ignore here the complications raised by the election of third-party candidates, as this is unlikely to be relevant in 2016.) At the moment, the Rs have 246 seats, and the Ds have 188. So the Ds would have to win a net of 30 seats from the Rs to gain control of the House.  That's a lot of seats! But it's not like we've never seen such a thing. As recently as 2010, Rs picked up 63 seats in a single election cycle. A smart thing to do would be to look through all of the recent elections, and see what the average amount of change has been. But I've been struggling to find these data in a digestible form[1]. I ended up working with a data set that had the virtue of going back to the beginning of our Republic but which also had a number of annoying typos in it[2], which I think I've managed to correct. I limited my number crunching to all of the elections following 1921, the first year in which the number of Congressional Representatives was fixed at 435. In the average House election (whatever that means), Ds lose 2 seats, and Rs pick up 2.33. Why aren't these numbers symmetrical, you ask? Third-party candidates. More importantly, there's is a ton of variance. The standard deviation for the Ds is 36.23 and for the R is 37.07. On no less than 18 occasions (out of 51 possibilities), one party picked up at least 30 seats.  1914 election: R Pres (Taft) in office during election, Rs pick up 66 seats\n1920 election: D Pres (Wilson) in office during election, Ds lose 59 seats\n1922 election: R Pres (Harding) in office during election, Rs lose 75 seats\n1928 election: R Pres (Harding) in office during election, Rs pick up 30 seats\n1930 election: R Pres (Hoover) in office during election, Rs lose 53 seats\n1932 election: R Pres (Hoover) in office during election, Rs lose 101 seats\n1938 election: D Pres (Roosevelt) in office during election, Ds lose 71 seats\n1942 election: D Pres (Roosevelt) in office during election, Ds lose 45 seats\n1946 election: D Pres (Truman) in office during election, Ds lose 55 seats\n1948 election: D Pres (Truman) in office during election, Ds pick up 75 seats\n1958 election: R Pres (Ike) in office during election, Rs lose 48 seats\n1964 election: D Pres (LBJ) in office during election, Ds pick up 36 seats\n1966 election: D Pres (LBJ) in office during election, Ds lose 47 seats\n1974 election: R Pres (Ford) in office during election, Rs lose 48 seats\n1980 election: D Pres (Carter) in office during election, Ds lose 36 seats\n1994 election: D Pres (Clinton) in office during election, Ds lose 54 seats\n2006 election: R Pres (Bush II) in office during election, Rs lose 33 seats\n2010 election: D Pres (Obama) in office during election, Ds lose 63 seats Bad news for the Ds: The majority (78%) of the time, the party that loses 30 or more seats in the House is the party with the sitting president at the time of the election. Worse news for Ds: The party with a sitting president loses on average 13.3 seats per House election. Slightly better news for the Ds: Given the high level of variance, there is a 0.123 probability of picking up 30 or more seats if your party holds the White House. (I haven't shown my work here because it was tedious to do and, I reckon, would be even more so to look at.) So far, so good. But foxes are supposed to have more than one trick up their furry little sleeves. So let's try it from another angle. According to the Cook Political Report, there are 65 district races that are to at least some degree competitive[3]. 19 of these are currently held by Ds, and the remaining 46 are held by Rs. That leaves 169 safe seats for the Ds and 200 safe seats for the Rs. The question, then, is this: How likely is it that the Ds can win 49 of the 65 (or more) of the competitive seat?[4] Glad you asked. CPR ranks these races as Solid R, Likely R, Leans R, Tossup, Leans D, Likely D, and Solid D. On the basis of CPR's own assessment of their levels of accuracy[5] and a little bit of body English, I'm translating these qualitative judgments into quantitative judgments as follows: Solid R: 0.997 probability of an R victory, 0.003 probability of a D victory\nLikely R: 0.95 probability of an R victory, 0.05 probability of a D victory\nLeans R: 0.85 probability of an R victory, 0.15 probability of a D victory\nTossup: 0.50 probability of an R victory, 0.50 probability of a D victory\nLeans D: 0.15 probability of an R victory, 0.85 probability of a D victory\nLikely D: 0.05 probability of an R victory, 0.95 probability of a D victory\nSolid D: 0.003 probability of an R victory, 0.997 probability of a D victory The average expected outcome is that Ds win 29 (rounding up from 28.79) of the 65 contested seats. That gets them to 197 total seats in the House, a nice outcome with their party holding the White House but far short of a majority. I ran a 1,000 round Monte Carlo simulation, and not once did Ds win more than 40 of these 65 seats (though they did hit 39 on a few occasions). Since Ds need to win 49 of the 65 competitive seats to take control of the House, I'm pretty damn pessimistic about their chances.  \"Unless...unless it's 1964 all over again,\" you might say. As we saw above, in 1964 LBJ ran as an unelected incumbent against an extremely unpopular R candidate, Barry Goldwater, who won the nomination after a highly contentious convention. Sound familiar? LBJ won the presidency in a landslide, and the Ds netted themselves 36 seats, 6 more than they need in 2016[6]. But I'd urge caution about betting the farm on another 1964. Marx's line about history repeating itself \"the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce\" has to be taken with a grain of salt. He was, after all, referring to \"all great world-historic facts and personages\"[7]. Honestly I don't think either Barry Goldwater or Donald Trump count as great world-historic personages, and I don't their runs for office are great world-historic facts. And Marx was at a point in his career where the pithy phrase was sometimes more important than the carefully reasoned analysis. Anyway, it's unwise to become fixated on a single data point when so much data is available. In 2003, we were obsessed with Munich, and anyone who voiced doubts about going to war with Iraq was an Attlee-esque appeaser, never mind the many, many dis-analogies. Sure, Mr. Trump could bomb as a general election candidate and drag down a lot of R House Representatives with him; I don't deny that for a second. But Rs running for House seats have been running away from Mr. Trump for some time now[8], and there are reports that the Koch brothers are shifting their considerable financial resources away from the presidential race (where they don't like what's on the menu) to Congressional and state-level races[9] where money makes a bigger difference. If we can see the risk to Rs in the House, it's no surprise that they can too and that they're acting tactically to try to counter the risk.  TL;DR: The historical data suggests something like a 12% chance that the Ds will retake the House, while the race-by-race data suggests a lot less, probably less than 1%. I'll blend these odds a nock it up 3% because treating the House races as if they were independent from one another (or, more properly, as if they were independent of common factors like who's at the top of the ticket) is obviously inadequate. So, for the moment at least, the Ds have a 10% of taking the House, while the Rs have a 90% of keeping it. --- [1] Brookings has the numbers since 1946, but they're in PDF format and not easily importable to a spreadsheet: http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Research/Files/Reports/2013/07/vital-statistics-congress-mann-ornstein/Vital-Statistics-Chapter-2--Congressional-Elections.pdf [2] http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0774721.html [3] http://cookpolitical.com/house/charts/race-ratings [4] That is to say, they need to win 19 of the 65 to break even and another 30 of the remaining 46 to take control.

Mr. Trump has no high-dollar donor network and has given little indication that he is willing to tap into his fortune to give the party the hundreds of millions of dollars it will require to finance its campaigns in the fall.\n. . .\n\"In the 2012 elections, the R.N.C. raised more than $409 million. The party has raised $135 million this election, but what is deeply concerning to many Republican candidates, contributors and strategists is that it only had a little more than $16 million on hand, along with nearly $2 million in debt, at the end of March. Mr. Spicer stressed that this was partly because the committee had already begun paying to send staff members to battleground states, well ahead of the same time four years ago. \"But the party\u2019s modest cash availability underscores how much hangs in the balance with its nominee. The minute Trump gets the nomination, the party is going to have to raise another three or four hundred million,\u201d said Al Hoffman, a Florida-based Republican donor. . . .  Mr. Hoffman, a former R.N.C. finance chairman, . . .  said he had little appetite to raise money for a Trump-led party and would probably focus his efforts this year on helping a local House candidate and assisting the re-election of his friend, Senator John McCain of Arizona. And he emphasized that he was not alone. \u201cAll the donors I\u2019ve talked to have said they want to sit out the presidential and just focus on the Senate and House,\u201d Mr. Hoffman said. \"Ray Washburne, a Republican fund-raiser from Dallas who also previously served as a national committee finance chairman, said, \u201cThere\u2019s a big switch to doing the Senate races and trying to hold onto the Senate.\u201d \"Mr. Washburne said Mr. Trump, who has relied on mostly small-dollar contributors in addition to about $36 million of his own money, showed no sign of being prepared for the fund-raising demands of a presidential general election. \u201cThe Trump group has done nothing about putting together a finance team at all,\u201d he said.  . . .  even as donors have asked him . . . how they could help Mr. Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t even know who the hell to tell them to call,\u201d Mr. Washburne said. \"This sort of unease about Mr. Trump, along with the dislike many of the party\u2019s business-oriented donors have for the hard-line Mr. Cruz, has prompted the R.N.C. to begin privately assuring donors that it will create a so-called Senate Trust fund. Money earmarked for that fund will go entirely to initiatives aimed at retaining the Senate \u2014 including hiring field operatives and opposition researchers and bolstering digital efforts. . . . \n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  The financial picture for the RNC seems to suggest that there will be significantly less support for House races than in the past, both because of decreased support for state party operations and because it sounds like the focus is going to be on retaining the Senate.   This suggests 2 things to me:  1) the RNC considers keeping control of the House reasonably likely, and 2) a few weak GOP House candidates may be considered somewhat expendable by the GOP, and therefore more vulnerable. So, for purposes of this forecast, I'm thinking that the GOP will retain control of the House, but with a smaller margin.\n"], [691, "2016-04-22T12:19:04Z", [0.16, 0.84], ""], [102, "2016-04-22T03:37:08Z", [0.17, 0.83], "https://larswericson.wordpress.com/2016/04/22/gitrep-21apr16pm/"], [24130, "2016-04-21T20:28:11Z", [0.16, 0.84], ""], [22457, "2016-04-21T20:19:37Z", [0.5, 0.5], ""], [38, "2016-04-21T20:07:46Z", [0.26, 0.74], "http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/the-2016-blast#ixzz46UdPB77x   \"POLITICO\u2019s Shane Goldmacher reports Roe told Republican Party leaders today that Donald Trump\u2019s nomination would be . . .  disastrous for non-presidential GOP candidates . . .\"\n. . . \n\"Roe predicted it is \u201chighly likely\u201d that the GOP contest will go to a contested convention . . .

They would thus need 22-24 of the remaining 39 seats, but Cook has just 9 \"likely Democrat\" and 5 \"lean Democrat\".  In the extreme case of the Democrats winning all the tossups being defended by Republicans they would gain only 18 seats overall, and would need to win all of the 13 \"lean Republican\" seats to gain 31.  There's a similar analysis by Rothenberg and Gonzales on 25 March.  http://rothenberggonzales.com/ratings/house\nThey say Dems have 183 safe seats compared to 218 for the Republicans, with just 34 seats in play, 27 of which are Republican. Further, of those 34, they consider 7 as Republican favored\" so the Democrats are unlikely to win 30. (Thanks to @Jean-Pierre for pointing me to the two references I've used above). Even though there could be a Democratic landslide at the Presidential level, in which case the Senate could change hands too, the House seems likely to remain Republican because of the way district boundaries have been drawn by mostly Republican state legislatures.  In addition, there's an interesting article suggesting a long term shift from Democrats to Republicans in areas where \"fracking\" and shale oil have improved local economies. http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/the-surprising-link-between-fracking-and-republican-power-in-congress/?utm\nIf that's the case, then the Democrats may find it difficult to reverse many of the Republican gains made in recent election cycles, as some hitherto \"purple\" states are trending further to \"red\"."], [19912, "2016-04-01T05:41:25Z", [0.05, 0.95], ""], [241, "2016-04-01T04:02:57Z", [0.25, 0.75], ""], [10267, "2016-04-01T03:42:44Z", [0.0, 1.0], ""], [102, "2016-04-01T02:06:02Z", [0.15, 0.85], "https://larswericson.wordpress.com/2016/04/01/gitrep-31mar16pm/"], [19170, "2016-03-31T21:33:07Z", [0.25, 0.75], ""], [368, "2016-03-31T19:59:25Z", [0.05, 0.95], ""], [691, "2016-03-31T17:53:06Z", [0.14, 0.86], ""], [484, "2016-03-31T16:13:17Z", [0.1, 0.9], "Up 10% R.

And the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is mounting a late push to stretch the political map by recruiting candidates in as many as 10 conservative-leaning House districts, in states like Florida and Kansas, where analysts believe Mr. Trump will harm Republicans. \"The Democratic committee, eager to cut into the Republicans\u2019 majority, has begun a large data project to model both support for and opposition to Mr. Trump. . . .  its data team was studying which of Mr. Trump\u2019s ideas and comments would be most offensive to key voting blocs, and how best to project those themes in congressional races. \"Gov. Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut, chairman of the Democratic Governors\u2019 Association, said Republicans had a no-win situation on their hands: They could either run from Mr. Trump and risk depressing Republican turnout, or embrace him and have to defend \u201cviews that are abhorrent\u201d to many people.\n. . . \n\"Both sides believe it is too early to measure the precise effect Mr. Trump will have on other elections this fall, in part because Mr. Trump has shown himself to be an unpredictable candidate with few compunctions about changing proposals and themes of his candidacy. \"Mr. Trump has said he anticipates that Republicans will ultimately embrace him in the general election; Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, predicted he would buoy Republicans down the ballot. \u201cIt is clear he has brought millions of voters to the party, received tremendous support and garnered millions more votes than any of his opponents,\u201d Ms. Hicks said. \"Still, the hope among Republicans is that Mr. Trump will be seen by many voters as a self-contained phenomenon: a one-man celebrity road show who does not reflect the totality or the values of the Republican Party.\n. . . \n\"And conservative groups tied to the billionaire donors Charles G. and David H. Koch are planning a major offensive this spring aimed at keeping the Senate in Republican hands, said James Davis, a spokesman for the Koch-backed group Freedom Partners. \"Josh Holmes, a top political adviser to the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said Republicans expected to be able to distinguish their candidates from Mr. Trump . . . \n. . . .\n\"But Democrats have already begun a concerted push to link Republicans running for other offices to Mr. Trump. \n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  It's early.

Bob Dold and Carlos Curbelo \u2014 are already sounding the alarm against Trump and his rhetoric on women, Hispanics and other groups. The party\u2019s outside groups are preparing an intensified fundraising push to help defend the chamber. The respected Cook Political Report downgraded Republicans\u2019 chances in 10 districts Friday. And though the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which has been stung by overzealous predictions in past years, won\u2019t say outright that the majority is in play, the party is clearly thinking about it. \"Democrats already had reasonable odds of flipping a dozen or so House seats. But DCCC Chairman Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n recently started highlighting \u201creach\u201d districts . . .  that broaden Democrats\u2019 target list enough to take back the chamber \u2014 if local candidates can take advantage of the sudden opportunity. Strategists are now turning their attention to moderate suburbs around Detroit, Minneapolis, Washington and other areas where House Democrats have struggled in recent years but Trump has already shown weakness.\n~~~~~~~\n\"A handful of particularly vulnerable Republicans have already distanced themselves from Trump.\n. . . \n\"But most House Republicans are keeping quiet. \u201cThe hardest part about it is having to answer every time the nominee says something,\u201d one worried Republican consultant said. \u201cIf he says this, \u2018Do you agree?\u2019 If he says that, \u2018Do you agree?\u2019 That\u2019s the hardest part, not being able to control your race more. I think Trump makes every district tougher and every state tougher for a Republican.\u201d \"To combat that, Republican outside groups are planning a bigger-than-expected fundraising push to protect the House. \"I think there are lots of major donors who may have been budgeting to play in presidential who are now saying we need to make sure we keep the House and the Senate,\u201d said one top GOP strategist, who requested anonymity to describe private conversations.\n. . . \n\"The National Republican Congressional Committee remains bullish on maintaining its majority. \u201cHouse Democrats have been pushing their far-fetched fantasy about a wave election sweeping them to a majority every cycle since voters rejected Nancy Pelosi\u2019s speakership in 2010,\u201d said Katie Martin, the NRCC\u2019s communications director. \u201cHere in the real world, a combination of their recruiting failures in races across the country and their own presidential candidate\u2019s abysmal favorability ratings ensure that Democrats\u2019 chances of winning the majority this year are as laughable as they were in 2012 and 2014.\u201d \"One major question mark for Democrats is whether they have the candidates to ride a wave, if Trump generates one in their favor. With the filing deadline approaching in Colorado, Democrats still don\u2019t have a candidate in GOP Rep. Scott Tipton\u2019s district, which the party targeted as recently as 2012 and which has a substantial Latino population. Bill Phillips, the Democratic candidate in Mica\u2019s Florida district \u2014 one of the seats Luj\u00e1n mentioned last week \u2014 had less than $20,000 in his campaign account to start the year. In key California districts, Democrats face primaries and feuding between local activists and the national party.\n~~~~~~\n\"And both parties caution that, more than seven months from Election Day, they don\u2019t yet have enough polling data on individual House races to make a definitive judgment on the state of play. This summer, the effort will kick into high gear, after Republican delegates either nominate Trump at their convention in Cleveland or rally behind another candidate after multiple ballots. \"Democrats need to net at least 30 seats to retake the House \u2014 the same number they flipped to take the majority in the 2006 wave. . . .  A potential path toward 30 seats, once thought to be outside the realm of possibility, has become clearer for Democrats in recent days. Luj\u00e1n ducked when asked whether Democrats could win back the House at a news conference last week, but his committee is actively preparing to compete in districts that weren\u2019t on the radar months ago. Democrats are targeting seats with \u201chigh numbers of independent voters, socially moderate voters, millennials and minority voters,\u201d Luj\u00e1n said.\n\u201cWe are going to keep recruiting through filing day because of this momentum that has been created by Donald Trump,\u201d Luj\u00e1n added.\n. . . \nNational Democrats say they\u2019re also looking closely at a collection of socially moderate suburban districts. Many of them haven\u2019t elected Democrats in years, but they have high proportions of the college-educated voters who have been least keen on Trump in the GOP presidential primary so far. Democrats figure that lack of enthusiasm could weigh down Republican House members in November.\n~~~~~~~\n\u201cThe hard part is that a lot of people are making absolute statements about what Trump is going to do for the electorate, but it\u2019s shown to be an incredibly unpredictable impact so far,\u201d said Matt Rexroad, a Republican consultant who\u2019s advising Knight.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  To me, this all adds up to \"unlikely but not impossible\" for Democrats, hence my 65% forecast for Republicans.\n"], [16272, "2016-03-21T19:09:33Z", [0.32, 0.68], ""], [17073, "2016-03-21T19:07:06Z", [0.55, 0.45], ""], [16915, "2016-03-21T18:15:02Z", [0.51, 0.49], ""], [12630, "2016-03-21T17:35:32Z", [0.11, 0.89], ""], [15097, "2016-03-21T16:24:47Z", [0.15, 0.85], ""], [22671, "2016-03-21T16:19:19Z", [0.75, 0.25], ""], [22670, "2016-03-21T15:50:33Z", [0.1, 0.9], ""], [22661, "2016-03-21T13:45:54Z", [0.4, 0.6], ""], [14421, "2016-03-21T13:16:11Z", [0.25, 0.75], ""], [691, "2016-03-21T12:59:42Z", [0.13, 0.87], ""], [21, "2016-03-21T12:57:48Z", [0.25, 0.75], ""], [16646, "2016-03-21T12:46:45Z", [0.1, 0.9], ""], [241, "2016-03-21T12:23:22Z", [0.25, 0.75], "http://www.vox.com/2016/3/18/11265196/can-democrats-win-the-house"], [19778, "2016-03-21T09:57:53Z", [0.25, 0.75], ""], [15964, "2016-03-21T09:42:10Z", [0.05, 0.95], ""], [19145, "2016-03-21T09:16:40Z", [0.1, 0.9], ""], [19856, "2016-03-21T07:51:22Z", [0.0, 1.0], ""], [21380, "2016-03-21T05:57:38Z", [0.65, 0.35], ""], [14709, "2016-03-21T04:41:19Z", [0.65, 0.35], ""], [20015, "2016-03-21T04:27:08Z", [0.3, 0.7], ""], [102, "2016-03-21T04:01:42Z", [0.14, 0.86], "https://larswericson.wordpress.com/2016/03/21/gitrep-20mar16pm/"], [4306, "2016-03-21T03:50:01Z", [0.05, 0.95], "Gerrymandering has made it almost impossible for 42nd to take back the house"], [10267, "2016-03-21T03:26:59Z", [0.0, 1.0], ""], [17304, "2016-03-21T01:36:49Z", [0.25, 0.75], ""], [409, "2016-03-20T23:43:38Z", [0.05, 0.95], ""], [20764, "2016-03-20T23:14:51Z", [0.3, 0.7], "The house is designed to allow local people to choose local candidates.

I need to think more about this, but I would like to make one point now that I've been thinking a lot about:  Is the conventional wisdom regarding the down-ballot effects of a Trump ticket correct? Conventional wisdom (and many comments) seem to assume there is some chance (even a high chance), that having Trump on the top of the ticket will suppress support for R senate & house candidates.  Although clearly possible, this strikes me as quite unlikely.  Down-ballot effects (as I understand them), are driven by low turn-out, caused by voter apathy / weak appeal for top-of-ticket.  If the #nevertrump folks stay home (i.e. the R's & I's who say they won't vote for him), then I would grant that that's bad for the Republicans across the ticket.  I also would grant that past precedent provides some evidence to suggest this is often the case when you have a President that lacks appeal with important parts of the base. This is a unusual year though, and it appears to me that most people seem quite invested in and motivated by the political process and potential outcomes here (both Trump supporters and the #nevertrump crowd).  I wouldn't be that surprised if there are reasonable %'s of moderate republicans and/or independents who cannot come around to Trump and who either vote for Hillary or a 3rd party, while still supporting down-ballot republican senators and representatives.  I also wouldn't be that surprised if ultimately a good chunk of \"traditional\" republicans who currently say they can't support him ultimately do vote for Trump.  What I WOULD be very surprised by is low turn-out amongst republicans and conservative-leaning independents this year.  I would also be VERY surprised if all the #neverTrump voters who are currently supporting Kasich/Rubio/Cruz/etc and say they would vote for Hillary vs. Trump somehow also find it in their hearts to also support Democratic congressmen.  Denying Trump is one thing, changing your political views is another. It's way to early to have a clear view on individual races here, but I think it's reasonably clear we're going to have a hard fought (very nasty) fight for President with huge stakes for the direction of the country.  I would guess most voters will strongly dislike both Trump and Hillary by the time we get to November (and maybe a 3rd party candidate too if anyone else runs).  That said, I don't see anything to suggest apathy or low turnout, and I don't sense a mood in the electorate that is swinging to Democrats (swinging populist, sure), so I'm not so sure we can so easily translate discord about the top of the ticket on the R side into poor chances for the down-ticket.  Trump will almost certainly win nomination, and he will also almost certainly bring in many new R voters.  He might not keep many of the current R voters, but my money is on most of those folks still voting for someone and also largely remaining conservative in their choices."], [20785, "2016-03-16T22:32:19Z", [0.29, 0.71], ""], [254, "2016-03-16T22:07:18Z", [0.25, 0.75], "Clinton should help democrats but probably not enough."], [22393, "2016-03-16T21:36:39Z", [0.75, 0.25], ""], [16510, "2016-03-16T21:20:46Z", [0.15, 0.85], ""], [19383, "2016-03-16T19:30:15Z", [0.65, 0.35], ""], [22391, "2016-03-16T19:26:21Z", [0.05, 0.95], ""], [22389, "2016-03-16T19:02:11Z", [0.7, 0.3], ""], [12006, "2016-03-16T18:29:17Z", [0.35, 0.65], ""], [12763, "2016-03-16T18:00:15Z", [0.05, 0.95], ""], [13859, "2016-03-16T17:19:07Z", [0.15, 0.85], ""], [12268, "2016-03-16T16:29:20Z", [0.25, 0.75], ""], [14777, "2016-03-16T15:35:02Z", [0.23, 0.77], ""], [21691, "2016-03-16T15:26:34Z", [0.15, 0.85], ""], [22371, "2016-03-16T15:22:12Z", [0.82, 0.18], ""], [691, "2016-03-16T14:51:41Z", [0.09, 0.91], ""], [22363, "2016-03-16T13:38:01Z", [0.01, 0.99], "Gerrymandered districts.

I'm still holding 5% for the democrats simply because the presidential primaries have indicated that this election is a bit bizarre and a big departure from historic elections. There is a small chance of a black swan like upset. Also, Democrats tend to have better turnout in presidential elections, but this factor tends to be driven by who the presidential candidate is and who they are running against. \n"], [17977, "2016-03-13T16:34:31Z", [0.4, 0.6], ""], [6552, "2016-03-13T15:56:54Z", [0.35, 0.65], ""], [19311, "2016-03-13T15:39:11Z", [0.1, 0.9], ""], [22130, "2016-03-13T15:28:48Z", [0.55, 0.45], ""], [15036, "2016-03-13T15:25:36Z", [0.25, 0.75], "It seems clear that Dems have a good chance of shortening the gap, but turning 30 seats in a single election is unlikely given a Democrat leaving the White House and rampant partisanship.

In the last two congressional elections held along side presidential elections, the Democrats gained 8 and 24 seats respectively.  Congressional elections held during midterms tend to result in more significant gains/changes and they tend to benefit Democrats.   The Republicans Party currently holds their largest majority in the House since 1928.   The Democratic Party is likely to gain some seats but it is not expected to be able to gain a majority of them.  Here is what is available: - Three Republican representatives resigned from their seats and another died in office in 2015. Special elections are usually held to replace reps who leave office before their term ends. It appears that there is only one vacant seat.  - Retiring incumbents.  6 Democrats and 18 Republicans\n- Incumbents seeking a Senate Seat leaving their House seat for grabs:  7 Democrats, 5 Republicans\n- 1 Democrat, in Delaware, is running for governor.  There are 24 seats that are considered contested (the so called battleground races where the winning margin is expected at less than 5% or the election is a toss up).  So far, 4 of them are leaning Republican, 4 are leaning Democrat, and the rest are a toss up.
