Summary:\nThis problem can be viewed as an economic problem primarily. The South China Sea is the most used trade route in the world, where every country has a stake in it. China is attempting to expand into an economic superpower in the coming decade [3].  There is so much to lose if something escalates to a confrontation. Due to the increased tensions between the United States and China the threat escalates. I\u2019m going to put this at a 17 percent likelihood.  Introduction: \nThe South China Sea, is a sea that is south of China (I don\u2019t care, I laughed writing this).  The South China Sea matters because 3.5 trillion dollars worth of trade go through there every year. Which is about 30 percent of the global maritime trade [1]. Which is about 1/5 of the total World trade and 2.2 Billion people live near the South China Sea. So if a confrontation happened, it would mess up the for everyone.   Base Rate: Okay, let\u2019s get into the down and dirty with all the details. Let\u2019s start with a base rate of 10% likelyhood based on the GJOpen.The base rate is always the hardest part for me, figuring out what I can measure empirically that can act as an accurate predictor of future events. So I\u2019m going to write down a bunch of bullshit that could be a base rate until I figure out which one I really want to go with. What would it take for this to happen? \nLet\u2019s think about this logically, if something were to happen, it would happen near disputed land within the South China Sea, because other countries would be entering their territory. Using that as an assumption, the most likely places it would be would be near the Island\u2019s that they\u2019re building on. And if there is a conflict it will most likely be with Zhanijang, where the People\u2019s Liberation Navy is stationed.  If there was a lethal confrontation with the Phillipines, where China attacks the Phillipines that would could potentially start a war with the United States. China doesn\u2019t want that smoke. As of September 30th, a chinese ship came 45 yards to a new a US ship [2]. That\u2019s enough information to upgrade it 4% to 14% likelihood. All of this is in with rising tensions between the United States and China, we can upgrade the probability by 3% to 17%. What is the probability of other countries confronting China.  Taiwan\nNot very likely, quite frankly, they\u2019re too far away from the disputed islands, not enough skin in the game.  Philippines\nDuterte is a fan of China. And the countries that should be watched are the Philippines and China. And the Philippines exported 15 billions dollars of goods to China.  \tMalaysia\n\tNot very likely.

The Pentagon accused the Chinese Navy of using \u201can unsafe and unprofessional maneuver\u201d when one of its destroyers challenged an American destroyer, the Decatur, as it sailed on Sunday near one of the disputed islets that China claims in the Spratly archipelago. The Chinese ship \u201cconducted a series of increasingly aggressive maneuvers,\u201d coming within 45 yards of the bow of the Decatur, a guided-missile cruiser on what the Pentagon described as a routine mission in international waters. The Chinese Navy\u2019s actions forced the Decatur to maneuver to avoid a collision, a spokesman for the Pacific Fleet, Capt. Charlie Brown, said in a statement. .  . .  The encounter on Sunday occurred within 12 nautical miles of Gaven Reef, a pair of outcroppings in the sea that China has expanded and fortified with weaponry since 2014. As tensions have increased over trade and other issues, the United States and other nations have intensified naval and aerial patrols in the sea to signal that the territories there remain in international waters. Britain, France and Japan have also conducted operations there in recent months, creating what many in China view as a coordinated campaign. China\u2019s defense and foreign ministries each released statements on Tuesday sharply criticizing the United States, though not disputing details of the American accusations involving the Decatur. \u201cThe United States has repeatedly sent military ships to South China Sea islands and its adjacent waters, threatened China\u2019s sovereignty and security, seriously damaged the relations between the two countries and militaries, and endangered regional peace and stability,\u201d Senior Col. Wu Qian, a spokesman for China\u2019s Ministry of National Defense, said in a statement. In 2016, an arbitration panel under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, ruling in an appeal brought by the Philippines, did not support China\u2019s claims to Gaven Reef, among other shoals and maritime features in the sea. China has ignored the ruling, however, and the fortification of seven artificial islands it has built there has made Chinese control of those waters virtually a fait accompli. China once brushed aside American accusations of \u201cmilitarizing\u201d the South China Sea \u2014 something the country\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, vowed publicly not to do during an appearance with President Barack Obama in 2015. In recent months, though, officials in Beijing have shifted the focus of their arguments. They now cite patrols like the one on Sunday as justification for the installation of defensive weaponry there. In his statement, Colonel Wu called on the United States to end its \u201cunlawful provocations\u201d against China\u2019s sovereignty. The United States has for years routinely patrolled the seas as part of what it calls \u201cfreedom of navigation operations.\u201d The patrols, officials say, are not intended to challenge any claims but rather to assert the right to \u201cinnocent passage\u201d within the 12 nautical miles of a coastline that are considered territorial waters under international law. With an ambitious naval modernization program well underway, China has become increasingly assertive in challenging patrols in the Spratlys and the Paracels, another disputed archipelago to the north. That has increased the risk of dangerous encounters on the high seas, adding one more irritant to relations that have deteriorated sharply because of the Trump administration\u2019s decision to impose tariffs on many imports from China. Last week, China abruptly canceled an annual security meeting planned for this month with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in Beijing, not long after calling off trade talks in Washington. It also denied a request by another American warship, the Wasp, to make a port visit in Hong Kong. In lieu of a port visit, the Wasp, an amphibious assault carrier with a contingent of Marines, also sailed through the region, though separately from the Decatur.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  It's incidents like this that remind me that though neither side wants fatalities, both are playing a game of chicken, more often, and that this increases the risk of a fatal confrontation."], [61341, "2018-10-02T20:20:00Z", [0.11], ""], [368, "2018-10-02T20:14:40Z", [0.0], ""], [58782, "2018-10-02T10:54:04Z", [0.0], ""], [34725, "2018-10-02T10:06:33Z", [0.0], ""], [67, "2018-10-02T01:04:03Z", [0.05], ""], [368, "2018-10-01T18:25:16Z", [0.0], ""], [61325, "2018-10-01T14:37:23Z", [0.15], ""], [691, "2018-10-01T11:28:53Z", [0.0], ""], [61316, "2018-10-01T02:59:51Z", [0.0], "China is constantly calls for the countries involved with the disputed islands with China to seat down and talk, so lethal confrontation is not going to happen "], [58593, "2018-09-30T22:33:39Z", [0.1], "China would not engage the US Navy; however, if a small regional power like Tailand or even Australia were to infringe upon their presumed territorial waters....you never know."], [61308, "2018-09-30T22:12:32Z", [0.0], ""], [2965, "2018-09-30T21:15:46Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2018-09-30T19:30:38Z", [0.0], ""], [61303, "2018-09-30T19:23:33Z", [0.05], "China will decide to restrain itself rather than risk hurting its economy."], [61302, "2018-09-30T19:08:09Z", [0.35], ""], [61265, "2018-09-30T17:34:10Z", [0.05], "China rules more with each passing day.

I think China's massive investment in this area and expansion of military exercises, trials of new military equipment, claims of threats from others, and military bases off the coast of the Philippines in the Spratly Islands, among other things, make it clear that they intend very much to claim and eventually enforce exclusive rights in this area.  And while I think Vietnam and Philippines can do very little on their own about this, I think the US and UK are continuing to move through the area in their \"normal\" way but on heightened alert to show that they don't plan to let China claim exclusive rights.  The fact that China is making a big deal about the \"provocation\" of a UK warship getting too close to the Paracel Islands, that they sent military vehicles to warn them off, suggests that China wants to continue to clearly stake to their claim but not yet actually enforce it.  The fact that the UK vessel was careful to stay exactly 12 nautical miles from the Island group in strict observation of an internationally recognized territorial limitation suggests that they are purposefully rejecting China's claims.  And will continue to do so.  And I think China will continue to expand their military, and in fact, this theater of aggression gives China the opportunity of openly expanding and exploring naval military development without unusual scrutiny (or at least any more than military agencies of various nations would otherwise give).  I think there is little likelihood for the time being of any slip up unless it comes from Vietnam or Philippines, and even then very small.  But eventually there will be some excuse of international political threat which will justify China's enforcement of their claims, and after having made them for years it will no doubt seem much more reasonable (to China and its allies) and justify warning shots.  And I imagine that the US and UK and others will then stand down rather than engage in direct confrontation unless there is some direct declaration of war already at hand.  The more realistic the threat, the less likely accidents are likely to happen unless they're staged on purpose to precipitate an event.

Subi reef in the Spratlys archipelago of the hotly contested South China Sea and, regional security experts believe, could soon be home to China\u2019s first troops based in the maritime heart of Southeast Asia. Private sector data analysis reviewed by Reuters shows Subi, some 1,200 km (750 miles) from China\u2019s coast, is now home to nearly 400 individual buildings \u2013 far more than other Chinese islands. Subi could be the future location of hundreds of People\u2019s Liberation Army marines, as well as a possible administrative hub as China cements its claim with a civilian presence, security analysts and diplomatic sources say.\n. . . \nSenior Western diplomats describe the placement of troops or jet fighters on the islands as a looming test of international efforts to curb China\u2019s determination to dominate the vital trade waterway. Subi is the largest of China\u2019s seven man-made outposts in the Spratlys. The so-called \u201cBig Three\u201d of Subi, Mischief and Fiery Cross reefs all share similar infrastructure \u2013 including emplacements for missiles, 3km runways, extensive storage facilities and a range of installations that can track satellites, foreign military activity and communications. Mischief and Fiery Cross each house almost 190 individual buildings and structures, according to the Earthrise analysis. . . .  While the data shows well developed infrastructure on some on islands such as Vietnam's Spratly Island, the Philippines' Thitu Island and Taiwan's Itu Aba, the scale and development by Beijing dwarfs its rivals. (For a multimedia package on the data, click tmsnrt.rs/2J3cWne) The number of buildings on Subi makes it similar in size to Woody Island in the Paracels, a Beijing-controlled group much closer to China also claimed by Vietnam. Woody is the base and surveillance post which foreign military attaches say is the headquarters of the military division across the South China Sea, reporting to the PLA\u2019s southern theater command. Koh and other analysts said the facilities on Subi, Mischief and Fiery Cross could each hold a regiment - between 1,500 to 2,400 troops. China\u2019s precise intentions remain unclear and Chinese experts say much will depend on whether Beijing feels threatened by regional security trends, particularly U.S. activity such as its so-called \u201cfreedom of navigation patrols\u201d.\n. . . \nBeijing has consistently said the facilities on its reclaimed islands are for civilian use and necessary self-defense purposes. China blames Washington for militarizing the region with their freedom of navigation patrols. Ding Duo, a researcher at the Chinese government-backed National Institute for South China Sea Studies, said Beijing needs a military presence in the Spratlys to protect its civilian infrastructure. \u201cAs for how big that presence is depends on the threat assessment China has going forward for the Nansha Islands,\u201d he said, using the Chinese name for the Spratlys. \u201cThe Nansha region faces severe military pressure, especially since Trump took office and increased freedom of navigation patrols. So China has raised its threat assessment.\u201d The White House said this month it had raised concerns with China about its latest militarization after CNBC reported anti-ship cruise missiles and surface-to-air missile systems had been installed on Subi, Mischief and Fiery Cross. [nL1N1SA1VE] This weekend, China revealed bombers had conducted take-off and landing training on some of its islands and reefs in preparation for what it called \u201cthe battle for the South China Sea\u201d. [nL3N1SR08Q]\n. . . \nOn Wednesday, the Pentagon withdrew an invitation for China to join a major naval drill because of Beijing\u2019s continued militarization of its islands in the South China Sea. [nL2N1SU1KU] Admiral Philip Davidson, the nominee to be the next commander of all U.S. forces in the Pacific, said last month the bases were now complete and lacked only deployed forces. \u201cAny forces deployed to the islands would easily overwhelm the military forces of any other South China Sea-claimants,\u201d Davidson told a congressional panel. So far, repeated U.S. naval patrols close to Chinese features and growing international naval deployments through the region have had little obvious impact on Beijing\u2019s plans. \u201cThere is a real sense among Western nations that a new strategy is needed, but there is little sign anything meaningful coalescing,\u201d said one senior Western diplomat familiar with discussions across several countries. \u201cThe deployment of jet fighters \u2013 even temporarily \u2013 will sorely test that lack of a cohesive response.\u201d Already large Chinese amphibious landing vessels and other ships have used the full-scale naval wharves at Fiery Cross, Subi and Mischief \u2013 pointing to what foreign naval officers describe as virtually a permanent presence throughout hotly contested waters. Chinese forces are using their island holdings to police of what Chinese naval officers tell other navies is a \u201cmilitary alert zone\u201d \u2013 an ambiguous term that both Asian and Western military officials say holds no basis in international law. People briefed on recent Western intelligence reports describe an intensifying pattern of radio challenges to foreign military ships and aircraft delivered from Chinese naval ships and monitoring stations on Fiery Cross. Australian officials recently publicized a \u201crobust but polite\u201d Chinese challenge to three of its naval ships plying the South China Sea en route to Vietnam. Sources say such exchanges between Chinese and foreign militaries are far more frequent than is widely known. \u201cThey have become the rule rather than the exception across significant areas of the South China Sea,\u201d one person familiar with recent Western security reports told Reuters. Ships and aircraft from India, France, Japan, New Zealand and rival claimants Vietnam, Malaysia and the Philippines have also been similarly warned, according to regional military officials and analysts. With the claimed \u201cmilitary alert zone\u201d having no basis in international law or military practice, foreign naval officials routinely stress they are in international waters and continue on their way. Zhang Baohui, a Chinese security expert at Hong Kong\u2019s Lingnan University, said Beijing was likely to be cautious about any offensive moves, such as the stationing of combat aircraft. \u201cNow the islands are complete, I think we will see a degree of caution in Beijing\u2019s next moves,\u201d he said. \u201cSustaining that presence so far from the Chinese coast is a massive undertaking, and I think the deployment of troops and jet fighters would really cross a threshold for China\u2019s neighbors.\u201d U.S. military officials insist they are leaving little to chance, warning the bases are already helping China project military power into areas once dominated by its neighbors. \u201cIn short, China is now capable of controlling the South China Sea in scenarios short of war with the United States,\u201d Davidson said in his testimony last month.\n"], [8670, "2018-07-15T15:24:08Z", [0.35], ""], [59865, "2018-07-15T13:54:43Z", [0.95], ""], [29984, "2018-07-15T13:09:47Z", [0.05], ""], [64, "2018-07-15T03:24:11Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2018-07-14T21:13:02Z", [0.0], ""], [44381, "2018-07-14T18:01:49Z", [0.11], ""], [368, "2018-07-14T01:27:12Z", [0.0], ""], [37488, "2018-07-13T04:16:17Z", [0.08], "https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/International-Relations/Duterte-under-pressure-to-press-South-China-Sea-claims\nhttps://www.chathamhouse.org/expert/comment/two-years-south-china-sea-ruling-remains-battleground-rules-based-order\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2018/07/01/china-will-lose-the-south-china-sea-game/#36e385ec3575\nhttps://www.scmp.com/week-asia/geopolitics/article/2153118/snubbed-worlds-biggest-war-game-will-beijing-make-waves-south\nhttps://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/07/09/1832007/philippines-us-kick-naval-drills-south-china-sea\nhttp://www.eastasiaforum.org/2018/06/29/the-world-is-pushing-back-in-the-south-china-sea/\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/05/us-intel-report-china-quietly-testing-electronic-warfare-assets-on-sp.html\nhttps://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/07/07/asia-pacific/chinas-hainan-province-invites-individuals-develop-uninhabited-islands-south-china-sea/#.W0gmnNJKgdU"], [55854, "2018-07-13T01:09:00Z", [0.2], ""], [3345, "2018-07-12T20:25:07Z", [0.9], ""], [368, "2018-07-12T19:11:18Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2018-07-12T14:10:50Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2018-07-12T12:29:23Z", [0.01], ""], [172, "2018-07-12T00:43:48Z", [0.08], ""], [59826, "2018-07-11T22:25:28Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2018-07-11T18:35:00Z", [0.0], ""], [59818, "2018-07-11T18:06:36Z", [0.08], ""], [47812, "2018-07-11T02:20:17Z", [0.07], ""], [368, "2018-07-10T16:22:05Z", [0.0], ""], [59794, "2018-07-10T11:33:42Z", [0.02], ""], [59793, "2018-07-10T11:30:23Z", [0.05], ""], [20879, "2018-07-10T11:15:17Z", [0.02], ""], [59792, "2018-07-10T10:01:25Z", [0.2], "I don't see a chance for any nation to challenge the Chinese at this time.

The Chinese confronted the American ships and warned them to leave, the Ministry of National Defense said in a statement posted on its website, but other details of the encounter were not immediately clear.\n . . . \nThe high-seas confrontation, while not unprecedented, came as tensions have been rising between the United States and China . . . \nIn recent months, China has appeared more determined to defend its claims in the South China Sea, reinforcing and arming its bases in the Paracel Islands and farther south in the Spratly Islands, even though the various islands, reefs, shoals and other outcroppings are also claimed by Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan and others. On May 18 China announced that it had for the first time landed its H-6K strategic bomber on an outpost in the Paracels, Woody Island. Earlier in the month the United States also formally protested the deployment of missiles and radar equipment on three artificial islands China has built in the Spratly Islands. American officials accused Beijing of breaking a promise the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, made in 2015 when he said China did not intend to militarize the disputed territories. In retaliation for the deployment, the Pentagon last week rescinded an invitation for China to participate in a multinational naval exercise this summer near Hawaii. The two American warships involved on Sunday were carrying out maneuvers known as \u201cfreedom of navigation operations.\u201d [FONO] The operations, which the Obama administration curtailed somewhat but which picked up again under President Trump, are intended to exercise what the United States says are its rights under international law. China, whose claims on the islands in the Paracel and Spratly Islands are not recognized, argues that passage within 12 nautical miles constitutes a violation of the country\u2019s territory under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. In April, Chinese ships and aircraft challenged three vessels of the Australian Navy as they traveled to port calls in Vietnam.\n~~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT: Since DJT has increased the number of FONO operations, the chances of some sort of military confrontation will increase.

China absolutely wants and will pursue expansion but gradually, being aggressive only in clearly \"defense\" of their established \"routines\" and territories, if they can now be called that.  But I think China doesn't want any confrontation, especially with a wild card like Trump involved, though it might consider small confrontations a cost of doing the kind of business they're doing.  Frankly a military show of force is a much better use of money than actual use of force.  However, I think there are still areas where confrontation is a real possibility.  Military exercises and aggression from personnel on ships is not unknown and although probably formally forbidden, may still result in an unexpected skirmish (maybe it's just my opinion about the fanatical culture within Chinese military, esp those patrolling the Pacific coasts).  There may be some issues over Taiwan as well, as this is a timely moment for China to enforce what they've long wanted to - now they have the economic leverage and are less likely to hedge about their political control in public/media to countries traditionally thinking poorly of Communism or China's uses of power.  On the other hand, Taiwan has few real allies left and none who could really off them real military support.  Plenty of neighboring countries might wish to depress China's growing power or expansion but they'll surely rely as much on diplomacy as possible and appease what they can rather than oppose or confront, and possibly Taiwan is probably already past the point of fighting for - a symbolic loss that we've long expected.  Pretty likely something will happen in the next 3 years, but probably not very likely it will happen this year.   US ships may be the biggest wild card - we're much more likely that others to be aggressive in a confrontation that results in a skirmish, though I think both US military officials and Chinese govt. officials probably really to avoid that at this point: too early for China and too risky for US (or Britain or Australia, etc).

Of those ten years only two (1974 and 1988 contained an actual lethal confrontation) which gives me a P/B 0.2. To calculate the dependent probability 0.227 x 0.2 = 0.045 which I'll round up to 5%. Factors:\n1. Bi-lateral relations between claimant states: We seem to be in an environment of stable relations between claimant states but China did announce a large South Chins Sea exercise and it is possible it will involve sensitive areas like the Paracels and the Spratly Islands. So I will increase this to 15%.\n2. American or other non-claimant state activities: None of these activities are out of historical norms. The US carrier strike group did depart bringing this factor back down to a point that won't affect the base rate. 5%\n3. Attempts to make gains or further militarize the environment: China may further militarize its outposts that may in turn provoke a response from other claimant states that gets out of hand (since China began land reclamation in 2013 we've seen militarization each year with no lethal response so 1.0 for further militarization and 0 for response to give a 50% probability); Vietnam could attempt to conduct further oil exploration after embarrassingly backing down in 2017 and now apparently again in 2018 (3 years out of the past 8 Vietnam has attempted and each year backed down from China so 0.375 for possible oil exploration and 0 for not backing down to give a 19%; China could start land reclamation around Scarborough Reef in the SCS (since we are not sure how many times China has intended to do so, if at all, but we do think there were some threats made by Obama in 2016 for China to back down so its probably less than a 50/50 but probably more than a 1/4 chance so I'll ball park it at 38%); and the Philippines is making noise about re-starting oil exploration around Reed Bank but also talking about doing joint projects with the Chinese.  It could conduct law enforcement against fishing that could provoke a lethal response from China (these have also occurred 2 out of the past 7 years and the Philippines backed down each time so that leaves another 14%).

Of those ten years only two (1974 and 1988 contained an actual lethal confrontation) which gives me a P/B 0.2. To calculate the dependent probability 0.227 x 0.2 = 0.045 which I'll round up to 5%. Factors:\n1. Bi-lateral relations between claimant states: We seem to be in an environment of stable relations between claimant states so I don't currently have this factor altering the base rate. 5%\n2. American or other non-claimant state activities: None of these activities are out of historical norms. The current presence of a US carrier strike group does slightly increase the potential for a lethal confrontation. 10%\n3. Attempts to make gains or further militarize the environment: China may further militarize its outposts that may in turn provoke a response from other claimant states that gets out of hand (since China began land reclamation in 2013 we've seen militarization each year with no lethal response so 1.0 for further militarization and 0 for response to give a 50% probability); Vietnam could attempt to conduct further oil exploration after embarrassingly backing down in 2017 (2 years out of the past 7 Vietnam has attempted and each year backed down from China so 0.285 for possible oil exploration and 0 for not backing down to give a 14%; China could start land reclamation around Scarborough Reef in the SCS (since we are not sure how many times China has intended to do so, if at all but we do think there were some threats made by Obama in 2016 for China to back down its probably less than a 50/50 but probably more than a 1/4 chance so I'll ball park it at 38%); and the Philippines is making noise about re-starting oil exploration around Reed Bank or it could conduct law enforcement against fishing that could provoke a lethal response from China (these have also occurred 2 out of the past 7 years and the Philippines backed down each time so that leaves another 14%).

Initially, before conducting any research, I assigned a much lower probability of this event happening, but the likelihood of a lethal confrontation is much greater than previously expected.  The Council on Foreign Relations argues that the territorial dispute over 8 islands between China and Japan, which is critical to U.S. interests, has escalated in the recent months.  Chinese vessels have increased incursions into the disputed waters and due to this, Japan has increased its military capabilities, such as radar and missile systems, which led to the same actions by China in response.  China has built large naval warships to guard its vessels to maintain strategic advantage, which has presented serious concerns to Japan.  Consequently, Chinese aircraft have approached Japan\u2019s airspace over 570 times, which has caused the Japanese military to scramble its jets 199 times as a response.  Although these events are concerning, it is pertinent to many major powers, including the United States, that no lethal confrontation takes place, which would undoubtedly cause additional casualties between the two historical enemies.  Both countries stand on completely inverse ideological and political spectrums, which may or may not influence future confrontations.

Probably of most relevance, a lethal confrontation in the Gulf of Tonkin, while technically not \"in the SCS\", would probably be reported as a \"SCS territorial dispute.\"  Also of relevance, I am choosing to exclude a conflict in the Yellow Sea (which could conceivably be reported as occurring in the ECS), which means that I can exclude the whole North Korean littoral zone. BASELINE ASSUMPTIONS\nProbability of lethal confrontation in SCS is much greater than in the ECS.  Why?  There are more actors, the governmental actors are less \"rational\" (I'm looking at the Philippines here), there are ongoing developments, and the Chinese seem to be more aggressively pushing their luck in the SCS.  As a result, I will try to estimate a risk for the SCS, and nudge it slightly upward to account for the ECS risk. Period of interest is 60 years.  That is, between the first formal disputations about ownership of the various SCS islands in the late 1950's (a product of throwing up national ownership of the seas for the first time) and the late 2010's.  During that time, there have been 3 lethal confrontations in the SCS:\n1974:  Conflict in the Paracel Islands between Chinese and South Vietnamese armed forces, with deaths on both sides.\n1988:  Johnson South Reef Skirmish between Chinese and Vietnamese armed forces, with Vietnamese deaths.\n2001:  Hainan Island Incident, where a US spy plane collided with a Chinese fighter, resulting in the (presumed) death of the Chinese pilot. [Please let me know if I have missed any \"lethal confrontations\" here ...] So 3 lethal confrontations in 60 years means a baseline risk of about (3/60=) 5% in the next 365 days (= odds of 1:19). MODIFICATIONS FROM BASELINE\nEvents since 2012, driven by increased Chinese assertiveness and construction, have increased the risk from baseline.  However, other claimant nations' willingness to push back against the Chinese depends in large part on their belief that the US would back them up.  I think the present administration's inconsistent foreign policy means that other claimant nations will be less likely to put their neck on the chopping block.  And the short-staffing in the Department of State means that there is difficulty following multiple crises simultaneously in an effective manner, and North Korea is dominating the attention span of the Executive branch at the moment.  In short, the risks are probably lower now than they would have been under a different US administration. On the other hand, does this de facto capitulation mean that China will become _more_ aggressive?  Maybe ... but maybe the Chinese leadership are playing a long game, happy to entrench their recent gains, and make further steady gains with little resistance. Overall, I'd put the Risk Ratio at 2x for the SCS in 2018, compared to the Baseline.  That means odds of 2:19, or 9.5%.  Round this up to 11% to allow for a 1.5% risk (odds of 1:66) of a lethal confrontation in the ECS."], [45072, "2018-01-01T00:00:59Z", [0.5], ""], [45071, "2017-12-31T23:56:05Z", [0.0], ""], [45069, "2017-12-31T23:55:44Z", [0.6], "China is flexing its muscles and has no fear of Trump or even Russia.

To refocus, it is clear to me that China is on a mission to eventually match U.S. revenue output.
