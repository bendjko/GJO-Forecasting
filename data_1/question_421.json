The army chief\u2019s commendation medal to Major Gogoi who had tied a Kashmiri to an army jeep and used him as a human shield last month was criticised by rights activists, and by former army generals.\nA video of the incident had triggered a row with many condemning it. Farooq Dar, who was tied to the jeep, said he was not a militant or a stone-thrower, and was only returning home after casting his vote in the by-election when he was hauled away. He said that he still suffered from physical and mental trauma after being paraded on the jeep\u2019s bonnet with a sign slung around his neck, warning stone-pelters of the consequences.\n\u201cPeople are throwing stones at us, people are throwing petrol bombs at us.

Then I would have been happy. Then I could do what I want to do,\u201d he said.\nHe also said that if people in any country lose fear of the army, then the country was doomed. \u201cAdversaries must be afraid of you and at the same time your people must be afraid of you. We are a \u2018friendly\u2019 army, but when we are called to restore law and order, people have to be afraid of us,\u201d he said, and asserted that \u2018maximum restraint\u2019 was being maintained while handling the situation in the disputed state.\" Adjusting down on time constraints."], [35838, "2017-05-29T14:10:56Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-05-29T05:17:55Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-05-29T00:40:36Z", [0.0], ""], [35815, "2017-05-28T22:12:15Z", [0.0], ""], [24159, "2017-05-28T14:39:21Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-05-28T06:55:53Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-05-27T21:42:15Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-05-27T06:09:03Z", [0.0], ""], [35806, "2017-05-26T19:25:35Z", [0.01], "There's always a chance- but given current affairs it is extremely unlikely "], [368, "2017-05-26T16:46:50Z", [0.0], ""], [21800, "2017-05-26T07:03:17Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-05-26T04:55:27Z", [0.0], ""], [755, "2017-05-26T03:42:19Z", [0.05], "Adjusting down solely on time constraints.

On Sunday, April 9, elections were held for a parliamentary seat left vacant in the main city of Srinagar after a lawmaker resigned in protest against last summer\u2019s killings. A majority stayed away, with only 7 percent turning up to vote. Young Kashmiris \u2014 fed up, brutalized, growing up in the most densely militarized zone in the world \u2014 surrounded polling stations to protest Indian rule. Some protesters threw stones at the polling booths and the troops stationed there. The troops responded as they do, with shooting, beating and blinding protesters and bystanders alike. Eight people were shot dead. Among those killed was 12-year-old schoolboy, Faizan Fayaz Dar, who was shot in the back of his head, the BBC reported from his village. Dirges rang from Kashmiri homes and graveyards. We have seen this before, like a tragic war film on a loop: young corpses floating on the shoulders of families and friends for that ultimate journey. Last year, during a four-month siege, nearly 100 people were killed and hundreds blinded, as Indian paramilitaries rained bullets and millions of buckshot pellets on protesting crowds. Now the response of the Indian state has turned even more ferocious. By the end of the week, three more youths had been killed, including a 17-year-old street vendor whose forehead was cracked open with a bullet. A college campus was raided by paramilitaries in full military gear, accompanied by an armored vehicle, injuring around 50 students. Earlier in the week, as the Indian Army was patrolling central Kashmir, soldiers chanced upon Farooq Ahmad Dar, a 26-year-old shawl weaver, who was returning home from a funeral prayer. As an artisan, Mr. Ahmad works with his hands, making filigree-like embroidery on \u201ccashmere\u201d shawls. The soldiers assaulted him, wounding his hands and arms. After the assault, the soldiers tied him up to the front of a jeep, strapped on a handwritten placard and paraded him through several villages for hours as a live trophy \u2014 a \u201chuman shield\u201d at the front of an armed posse (para. 1-7).

Police have filed a case against the army over the incident, in which soldiers are accused of seizing a 24-year old shawl weaver on April 9, strapping him to the front of their vehicle and then parading him through villages. A video of the episode circulated widely on social media, in a reminder for some of alleged human rights abuses perpetrated by Indian security forces as they struggle to contain a separatist insurgency that is now in its 28th year. Army spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Rajesh Kalia said the veracity of the video was being ascertained, adding, \"Action will be taken against those found guilty of misconduct.\" Protests last week followed a botched by-election in which at least eight people were killed. Over the weekend two more videos circulated on social media showing workers of the ruling political party in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir renouncing mainstream politics, one of them beside a man wielding a gun (para. 1-6).

It was established in 1968 following the intelligence failures of the Sino-Indian and Indo-Pakistani wars, which persuaded the Government of India to create a specialised, independent agency dedicated to foreign intelligence gathering; previously, both domestic and foreign intelligence had been the purview of the Intelligence Bureau.\nDuring the nine-year tenure of its first Director, Rameshwar Nath Kao, R&AW quickly came to prominence in the global intelligence community, playing a role in major events such as the independence of Bangladesh and the accession of the state of Sikkim to India. The agency's primary function is gathering foreign intelligence, engaging in counter-terrorism, promoting counter-proliferation, advising Indian policymakers, and advancing India's foreign strategic interests. It is also involved in the security of India's nuclear programme.

Some sort of ground offensive is always being conducted if you count the operations taken up by Indian military forces against the terrorists and their local sympathisers, but that is unlikely to resolve this question as per my understanding.
