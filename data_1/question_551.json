As a more cynical alternative, I underestimated the willingness of the Catalan government to fabricate a realistic-sounding result in the absence of a valid voting process. In review:\nMy forecast of a \"Yes, independence\" vote sat at around 65-70% from my initial forecast on 15 August until 25 September ago.  (The only exception was dropping the probability to around 50% for a week or so after the bombings.)  This was ahead of the crowd until about 10 Sep, when the consensus trend rose to meet this. Consensus trend swung radically to \"No\" on 22 September, in the setting of a rush of new participants.    I defected to a weak \"No\" on 25 September after the dissolution of the Electoral Syndicate.  I had envisioned the \"Yes, independence\" outcome as an illegal and potentially-being-suppressed vote, but a vote that was at least organised to a degree.  The dismissal of the Electoral Syndicate made this much less likely.  I was slow to envision how the ultimately-chaotic \"drop your own write-in ballot into a unmarked box on the street\" could lead to an official vote count and result.  (Does anyone else find it suspicious how quickly an exact result was declared?) I really only went all-in on the \"No\" response (that is, more strongly \"No\" that the consensus trend) from 27 September to 1 October.  Hopefully that won't cause too much damage.

On the basis of the comparison class of the 2015 referendum, I think it is highly likely that the scorer of this question will resolve it as YES. This despite the many irregularities in this process, as detailed, for example, by @sevedb in many of her recent forecasts, and as most recently noted by @dsarin.  Much of this process of mass peaceful protests and an irregular voting process reminds me of the early history of the breakaway region of Ukraine. I hope this does not lead to civil war -- again -- in Spain. People still are alive who remember their civil war. When I visited the region of Andalucia flying in a hot air balloon in the 2001 World Air Games, I saw guard posts still standing but not being used and noticed that across that broad landscape, there were no fences around any of its fields of sunflowers, wheat, and pastures It gave me the impression that the central government saw threat of civil war as something that had not receded very far.  I'm wondering whether these many small fortifications might still exist in Catalan, and whether there are no fences to slow movements of troops. On the other hand, Catalan has considerable rough terrain well suited to guerrilla action. My feeling is that one way or another, today's show of forces by both sides will not play out well.

I am feeling utterly cyclothymic about this whole question.  And that is using the clear Yes/No criterion of \"Will the Catalan government declare an official result?\"  (Discussion and explanation about that criterion here: https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/582952)  If the GJO judges are using a different criterion, who knows??? So it really comes down to two main factors:\n1.  Will the Catalan government be able to declare a result?\n2.  If they can declare a result, will they choose to do so and make it official? CAN THEY?\nI have this at p= 0.40 today (up from 0.20 previously).   I think people will turn out.  I think the police forces will fail to prevent people turning out lodging ballots.  I think there'll be plenty of social media posts of people voting \"Leave\". However, despite the zeitgeist, newspaper stories, and Catalan Government cheerleading, I have major doubts about the processes that will be rolled out tomorrow.  I have doubts that ballot boxes and papers will be available at all, or even most, polling stations.  I have major doubts about whether electoral officials will turn up on the day.   I think there is a good chance we will see polling stations with thousands of people queuing ... and only a single official with a single ballot box and a few hundred papers ... and perhaps no electoral roll.  The police won't even have to make an arrest.  They'll just take the official's name and say, \"Go home now, or we will fine you thousands of euro next week\".  There may be insufficient officials to maintain ballot box security, or make a valid count at the end of the day.  (Running elections is hard work, and that is in the best of circumstances.) So I think it is still somewhat less that 50% likely that, within the next few days, the Catalan Government will wind up with any sort of reliable count on it's desk of i) total number of votes cast and counted and ii) how those votes were cast.  (Or rather, a reliable count that is large enough to warrant a result.  It is possible they might have a \"reliable count\" for a couple of percent of the electorate, and a \"guess count\" for many more.) WILL THEY?\nSo let's assume the Catalan Government, by Wednesday morning, has a (reasonably) reliable result showing a 20% turnout and a result 95% in favour of independence.  Would they declare that as an official result? I have this at p= 0.60 today (up from 0.50 previously). Regardless of the results in front of them, the vote will be clearly compromised.  There will be numerous reports of people wanting to vote, but being unable to.  There will quickly be reports of numerous \"irregularities\" in balloting procedures, and substandard scrutiny of the count.  (See the newspaper reports about irregularities in how the electoral officials have been contacted.)  International observers will, in some small degree, be present.  The Catalan Government thinks this is good: it will show \"oppression\" by Spanish forces.  More likely those observers will say: \"This vote was a complete shambles.\" It is a near certainty that _no-one_ will honestly believe that the results are truly indicative of the public will. So does the Catalan Government declare that result?  I have discussed the possible motivations for the Catalan government here: https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/583622 (see about half-way down).  I am not sure whether the pro-independence cause is better served in a hearts-and-minds sense by claiming:\ni)  \"We cannot declare a result!  Our vote was robbed!  The will of the people was thwarted!  The Spanish are fascists!\"; or\nii)  \"We won!  We declare unilateral independence!\" ... and trying to trigger a Spanish military response. Trouble is that the Catalan Government has been giving _seriously_ mixed messages on whether there will be unilateral declaration of independence (\"DUI\" in Catalan) after a \"Leave\" vote.  If there is no intent to have a DUI, then there is _no_ reason to declare an official win for the \"Leave\" vote.  On the other hand, there is certainly a sense of momentum within the Catalan leadership bunker, and they may well have personal motivations to declare a win for \"Leave\".  So I think it is a little more likely than not that, if the Catalan Government can declare a win for \"Leave\", that they will. As an aside, if we get the low-probability outcome of the \"Remain\" vote getting a majority, I think it is a certainty that the Catalan Government would declare: \"The vote was disrupted; we can't declare a result.\"  So it is now p<0.005 that a vote will be held and \"Remain\" will win (ie. 0% with rounding)."], [23234, "2017-09-29T22:39:33Z", [0.55, 0.05, 0.4], "Comment deleted on Sep 30, 2017 04:53PM UTC"], [13377, "2017-09-29T20:23:30Z", [0.95, 0.0, 0.05], ""], [38, "2017-09-29T20:17:55Z", [0.95, 0.0, 0.05], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/world/europe/catalonia-spain-referendum.html?emc=edit_mbae_20170928&nl=&nlid=77825025&te=1&_r=0 I'm looking at the restrictive clauses in this question:\n1) Before 1 Jan 2018:  yep, the  vote will be this Sunday 2) will the Catalan government:  yep.   \" . . . about 750 of the almost 950 mayors of Catalonia have vowed to facilitate the referendum . . . \" The question doesn't ask if the NATIONAL government will hold it, or if it will be considered legal or binding by the NATIONAL government. 3) hold a public vote:  yep.

If the public do not know if they are eligible to vote or not, or if those eligible to vote do not know how and where to caste their ballot I would not count it as a public vote.

If the public are informed of where the polling station are and when they are open, then that information would be known to the police. If the police know when and where polling will take place they can prevent access to these places, remove list of eligible voters, arrest those administering the votes and confiscate ballot boxes, The public could demonstrate against this, but I can't see how the results of any vote if the voters have to fight their way past the police could be considered valid, unless there was an incredibly high turnout 80% with more than 50% of the total electorate supporting one side and no chance of vote tampering.

Why, so can I, or so can any man; But will they come when you do call for them?  -- Shakespeare] Dateline 9-27-2017 A senior judge at the High Court in Catalonia issued an order on Wednesday evening which did three key things in relation to the anti-referendum policing measures in Catalonia as regards Sunday's vote. Firstly, the new order\u2014a copy of which has been obtained by The Spain Report\u2014tells all police forces in the region, Catalan Police (Mossos), Civil Guard, National Police and local police to work together to shut down the referendum, in very similar terms to the order issued by the Public Prosecutor's Office on Tuesday. Officers must prevent public buildings and premises from being used as polling stations or to otherwise prepare or organise the referendum between now and Sunday, October 1. If any are opened or used for those purposes, the police are to close them down. The police must also seize any materials being used to prepare or hold the referendum, including computers, with the addition in the new order of instructions to go after the logistical and vote counting centres. The judge reaffirmed the role of the Home Office appointed policing coordinator, a Civil Guard colonel, for the next few days in Catalonia. Secondly, the High Court judge tells the Public Prosecutor's Office that she is now in charge of anti-referendum policing orders\u2014given that a criminal investigation has now been opened and is being processed through the courts\u2014and that the Public Prosecutor's Office must stop issuing its own policing orders. The second part of the order, related to the public prosecutor, is a standard part of Spanish procedural law when an investigating judge takes over initial investigations by a prosecutor. Thirdly, the High Court ruling on Wednesday provided the first judicial interpretation of the Catalan government's actions to ignore previous court orders on the referendum and preparations for it. The judge was ruling on complaints filed by the Public Prosecutor's Office against the members of the regional Catalan government for disobeying Constitutional Court rulings on the referendum. The Catalan government, she said, was \"clearly\" not paying attention to those rulings, or to those orders issued by the High Court shutting down referendum websites. Such a \"reluctant\" attitude, and the \"provision of all means at their disposal\" to hold the suspended referendum on Sunday \"clearly infringes the decisions of the Constitutional Court\". -- https://www.thespainreport.com/articles/1162-170927204600-judge-at-high-court-in-catalonia-orders-police-to-close-down-referendum-and-takes-control-from-prosecutor"], [23234, "2017-09-27T21:13:39Z", [0.55, 0.04, 0.41], ""], [368, "2017-09-27T20:58:25Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [23006, "2017-09-27T19:39:59Z", [0.8, 0.2, 0.0], "Charlie Munger's dog aka Deprival-Superreaction tendency  +20% If they were blas\u00e9 about voting in this referendum before, which I believe the majority were, they certainly are not now."], [1333, "2017-09-27T17:27:59Z", [0.15, 0.0, 0.85], ""], [37379, "2017-09-27T16:52:06Z", [0.32, 0.0, 0.68], "On the one hand, school sleep-ins are planned to keep them open Sunday as polling places.

Despite what their Catalonian boss, Forn, has said (https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/582828), the Mossos are visiting polling stations and collecting names and numbers (http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20170926/431584086522/mossos-colegios-electorales-preguntan-1-o-referendum.html).  I think that the idea that the Mossos will \"facilitate the referendum\" is wishful thinking.  At best (for the Leave side), _some_ Mossos agents might be less-than-full-compliant with orders coming from the Prosecutor's Office.  2.  Official orders have come down that police will be physically stationed at polling stations to keep them closed all day Sunday (http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20170926/431578437386/fiscalia-ordena-mossos-precinten-desalojen-puntos-votacion-referendum-1o.html).  Assuming the Mossos/National Guard/etc are generally compliant with this order, it is hard to see how voting will occur.   3.  Puigdemont is continuing to press people to turn out and have their say (http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20170926/431581125649/puigdemont-catalunya-no-olvidara-ataques-rajoy.html), without providing any practical rebuttal to how a vote might go ahead given the tightening restrictions in place.   This fits a broad pattern of the Catalan Government's pronouncements over the last month:\n\"Trust us local mayors, we have a secret plan to make sure that you won't be fined by the Spanish Government\";\n\"We've dismissed the Electoral Syndicate, but trust us, we have secret plans to make sure the election will be officiated anyway\";\n\"The ballot boxes and ballot papers have been confiscated, but trust us, we have secret back up plans\"; \n\"The notifications to polling officials have not been sent out, but trust us, we have other ways of contacting those 45,000 people in the next 12 hours\"; and now\n\"Polling places will be closed by police?  Turn up and vote anyway to 'spoil the forecasts', as we have a secret plan for how you will be able to vote despite having no electoral officials, no balloting materials, and now no open polling booths.\"\nIn no case has the Catalan Government publicly announced how the very real obstacles to holding an election will be overcome.  I understand the importance of keeping things quiet to prevent the Spanish Government from preempting your \"secret\" contingency plans.  But the conclusion I am drawing is that there _are_ no contingency plans.  Can you blame me? So some analysis ...\nThe Catalan Government is holding this vote to see a benefit for the Leave cause.  This benefit might be in one of three ways.\n1)  Leave wins the vote, and the vote is generally seen as a mandate to unilaterally declare independence.\n2)  Leave wins the vote, and by strong enough a margin that the Catalan Government can negotiate with the Spanish Government from a position of power.\n3)  The process of holding a vote triggers a disproportionate response from the Spanish Government, such that the Remain cause is weakened in the hearts & minds of Catalans in the longer term. At the moment, it is highly unlikely that, even if a vote is held, it will be seen to be reflective of the general Catalan will.  So they don't gain 1) or 2).  The largest Leave party in Catalonia has announced that there will be no unilateral declaration of independence.  So they are renouncing 1) as an objective.  And lastly, even if the Spanish Government did not interfere, the likely outcome would have been a win to \"Leave\" based on a low turnout (as in 2014), or else a higher turnout but a \"Remain\" or a very close \"Leave\" win ... neither of which appreciably strengthen the hand of the Catalan Government against the Spanish Government. That leaves the likely objective of the vote as: create maximum chaos and media coverage of repression of \"ordinary Catalans\", and thereby weaken the legitimacy of the Spanish State and its instruments of repression.  And it may well be that this _always_ was the intent of holding a vote, given the pro-Leave parties and pro-Leave populace represented only half of Catalonia.  Perhaps if things lined up perfectly (highish turnout, and \"Leave\" wins by a respectable margin), they might have jumped at a unilateral declaration of independence ... but even then I wonder if they expected that that truly would have resulted in an independent Catalonia, or would such a declaration have been an even sharper provocation to Spain to send in the troops. I see it as entirely likely that Puigdemont will continue to howl for Catalans to turn up on the day, and continue to promise that there will be both an opportunity to vote, and a result declared.  This will maximise the opportunity for violent confrontation with police.  Once that happens on Sunday however, I see _no_ benefit to the Catalan Government declaring a result.  Any declared \"Leave\" result from such a compromised voting process would be scoffed at by the international community and the Spanish Government, and thus does not help reach objectives 1) and 2).  And if \"maximum resentment\" is the aim, then it looks better to declare _after_ Sunday that the vote was \"oppressed\" by the diabolical Spanish Government. DECREASE probability that the Catalan Government are able to hold a vote and declare a result: 0.35 -> 0.20\nNo ballot boxes, no ballot papers, no Electoral Syndicate, no notification to prospective electoral officials, no open polling places ... and I'm pretty sure there are no \"secret plans\" to deal with these barriers.  Some locations may have some votes collected and counted, but not enough to declare a result even if the Catalan Government wanted to (see below). DECREASE probability that the Catalan Government, if able to hold a vote, chooses to proceed with the vote: 0.80 -> 0.50\n... and I'm not even sure that the Catalan Government _wants_ to declare a result.  I think that even if, on Monday evening, they get a trickle of results back from a few booths that were able to open, with perhaps 5-10% turnout and 95% voting for independence, the \"maximum resentment\" objective is better achieved by claiming \"They took our votes\" than saying \"Leave has won\".

But apparently 45,000 of the 55,000 notifications have yet to be sent out.  So once again, who will be actually running this election on the day?? 2.  The main party in the pro-independence coalition that makes up the Catalan Government has now announced that a \"Yes\" vote will _not_ be followed by a unilateral declaration of independence; it is \"absolutely ruled out.\"  (See http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20170926/431574607143/pdecat-dui-descartada.html)  The main aim of the \"referendum\" now is to produce a result that can be used in future negotiations with the Spanish Government: \"I cannot imagine that [after a vote for independence], Spanish institutions will not understand that the time for dialogue has arrived.\" What to make of this?  On one hand, a softer line from the Catalan Government means that the Spanish Government is less likely to \"go nuclear\" and activate Article 155 (which they are running out of time to do) or call in the troops ... which means that at least some kind of vote goes ahead.  On the other hand, this reinforces the perception that elements of the Catalan Government are starting to fear the personal legal consequences of defying Spanish law ... which means that there is a chance that the Catalan Government, as they did with the Electoral Syndicate being dismissed, might capitulate and cancel the vote in the next couple of days. DECREASE probability that the Catalan Government are able to hold a vote and declare a result: 0.40 -> 0.35 So I see people turning up to vote, but no officials in place, and perhaps no ballot boxes or ballot papers.

I'm also decreasing probability to zero of a NO vote winning because this heavy handed behavior is likely to convert undecided citizens into supporters of independence. Comparison class: when  the revolt began in Ukraine's Donbas and Luhansk provinces, the central  government sent in troops. When troops encountered crowds of unarmed, peaceful citizens, including a high percentage of women, they backed down.  Will Spain's outside police be willing to drag peaceful would-be voters away from the polls? Will they even be able to find where the ballots are being accepted from citizens?  My guess is that if the people of Catalan can maintain peaceful resistance, avoid the temptation to riot, they have a fighting chance to pull off this referendum and thus lead Catalan President Carles Puigdemont to declare that YES has won. If he has to make this declaration from jail -- comparison class, Martin Luther King, \"Letter from a Birmingham Jail.\" He would be a hero to his people.   Dateline 9-25-2017 Spain\u2019s attorney general has refused to rule out the possibility of arresting the Catalan president, as the region\u2019s pro-sovereignty government prepares to defy Madrid by holding an independence referendum on Sunday. Jos\u00e9 Manuel Maza said that Carles Puigdemont could face action for disobedience, breaching public duties and misuse of public funds for proceeding with the poll after Spain\u2019s constitutional court suspended the hastily passed legislation underpinning the vote. Maza said the regional president could be arrested for misuse of public funds as the crime carries a jail sentence. On Monday, he told Onda Cero radio that although such a move had not been judged \u201ctimely\u201d as yet, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s a decision that\u2019s always available.\u201d Speaking days after Spanish police arrested 14 Catalan officials, seized almost 10m ballot papers and chartered ferries to accommodate the thousands of extra police officers who are being sent to Catalonia to stop the referendum, Maza rejected suggestions that the government was being heavy-handed. -- https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/25/spain-attorney-general-refuses-rule-out-arrest-catalan-president"], [23234, "2017-09-26T03:53:55Z", [0.5, 0.05, 0.45], ""], [23234, "2017-09-25T21:07:15Z", [0.42, 0.05, 0.53], "Comment deleted on Oct 02, 2017 02:05AM UTC"], [37379, "2017-09-25T20:42:40Z", [0.39, 0.02, 0.59], "Following @Ken_Burn's excellent data and analysis at https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/582119"], [691, "2017-09-25T18:28:13Z", [0.47, 0.15, 0.38], ""], [368, "2017-09-25T17:05:24Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [23006, "2017-09-25T16:26:45Z", [0.22, 0.27, 0.51], ""], [24, "2017-09-25T14:20:43Z", [0.35, 0.3, 0.35], ""], [23234, "2017-09-25T13:49:24Z", [0.48, 0.07, 0.45], ""], [28414, "2017-09-25T10:56:21Z", [0.35, 0.0, 0.65], ""], [14493, "2017-09-25T10:41:07Z", [0.35, 0.0, 0.65], "This question could turn on what counts as \"a public vote\". If the Spanish government disrupts the distribution of voting cards and access to polling locations, and only (say) 10% of people get to caste some sort  of vote somewhere and the votes get counted by people unknown and no one really trusts the result as reflecting public opinion, can this really be called \"a public vote on independence\"? If Russia announced that a similar (illegal) exercise in Eastern Ukraine had shown that the public there wanted to become part of Russia, no one would regard it as a real public vote. So I would suggest that even if some voting takes place in Catalonia, in the present circumstance it would not pass the test of showing what the public really thought. \nI have asked Spanish friends for their views. It would be expected that supporters of Rajoy and the PP would be against the referendum, so I was more interested what younger people who had more sympathy with Podemos (left wing populist party) and who spoke Catalan (or Valenciano) thought. The view was that the situation is a mess with both sides trying to provoke conflict; that the Catalans and the rest of Spain had agreed to the Spanish Constitution that says the referendum is illegal and the Catalan government should do things the legal way (try and get the Spanish constitution changed first); the Spanish Government is determined to  stop the vote and they have replaced the 'Mossos de Esquadra' (the autonomous Catalan police force) by National Police from outside Catalonia (my friends find this very significant) the Guardia Civil (the para-military police who's role is to protect the Spanish State from civil unrest) is also involved. So summing up, they think the Spanish Government has the means to prevent the vote and has the law on its side, and that if the Catalan officials don't back down they will face serious legal consequences. They also think that Catalan independence is a distraction from dealing with the real problems that they perceive; corruption by all political groups (particularly the PP but also other parties including regional governments), very high unemployment for young people in particular.   \nSo my \"NO\" mean no meaningful public vote, even if some polling takes place. \n\n"], [28414, "2017-09-25T09:38:26Z", [0.4, 0.0, 0.6], ""], [28414, "2017-09-25T08:31:17Z", [0.5, 0.0, 0.5], ""], [38319, "2017-09-25T08:17:05Z", [0.39, 0.02, 0.59], "How did I miss this???

Because Syndicate board members would each be subject to daily fines of 12,000 euro (!), starting on Friday, the Catalan Government (perhaps at the request of the individual Syndicate members) instead immediately discharged the Syndicate, and thanked the board members for their service. This has a couple of implications: 1.  Who the heck is running this vote?  Apparently, the election will now be officiated by \"public entities, academics, and international observers\".  (I thought the international community pretty much thought this vote was illegal ...)  So people will be turning up to vote, but no-one will be centrally responsible for making sure voting procedures will be followed, and no-one is officially responsible for counting the vote!  Now I would not put it past the Catalan Government to declare, \"We had a vote and independence won ... but we cannot give you exact results\", but it does raise the chance that people vote, but no official result is declared by the Catalan Government.  By my interpretation, this would _not_ count as \"the Catalan Government holding a vote\" (holding a vote includes declaring a result). 2.  Secondly, it means that the Catalan Government _is_ somewhat sensitive to the Constitutional Court issuing massive fines to those holding the vote.  I really thought that their attitude would have been more along the lines of, \"We'll be an independent nation in a couple of months, so good luck getting those fines to stick.\"  At this point, I think there is now a chance (albeit small) that elements of the Catalan Government blink first even if the Spanish Government _doesn't_ activate Article 155 or send troops on the streets.

The Spanish courts have ruled the vote illegal, and the Catalan police force, the Mossos d\u2019Esquadra, is expected to work alongside thousands of state police, brought especially to the region, to prevent it. The Spanish interior ministry told all local and national police forces on Saturday they had been temporarily placed under a single chain of command reporting directly to the interior ministry in Madrid. The ministry would directly co-ordinate all police operations in Catalonia as the government prepares to forcibly prevent the referendum. But the pro-independence Catalan regional government has said it will not comply with the ruling, opening up another front in a rapidly escalating conflict between Madrid and Catalonia that threatens to turn into an acute constitutional crisis. https://www.ft.com/content/c12596c0-a06f-11e7-9e4f-7f5e6a7c98a2\n"], [32540, "2017-09-25T02:32:53Z", [0.85, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [691, "2017-09-25T01:14:45Z", [0.33, 0.32, 0.35], "The Catalan government is pretty adamant about holding this election, despite the hefty interventions from Madrid.

Ultimately, it is in the hands of the Spanish Government's response.   They have the ability to absolutely prevent the vote if they so choose (armed intervention, or activating Article 155), but that would only be at an unacceptable political cost.  Use of that level of force could well lose them Catalonia in the long term. They will probably try to prevent the vote with the current, more moderate approach.  I see the current approach as firm, practical; it retains the support of Catalans who support \"Remain\" and are resentful of the actions of a Catalan governing coalition that did not win a majority of the popular vote in 2015 and rushed an illegal enabling act through parliament on 6 September.  My best guess is that this approach will not actually prevent a vote occurring - the current response is insufficient to stop the vote next Sunday - but it will make the vote so anaemic that it will have no legitimacy.  Also, it is least likely to swing \"undecideds\" into the \"Leave\" camp in the longer-term. They could go a little too strong on the response.  That is, strong enough to upset the local Catalonian police, the Mossos, but not strong enough to completely prevent the vote.  The Spanish Government's dependence on the Mossos is problematic.  Firstly, even with the importation of police from the rest of Spain in the last few days, the Mossos are still going to be the majority of \"feet on the ground\" enacting the will of the Spanish Government.  Secondly, being a Catalonian force, there would a significant number, if not a majority, of members of the Mossos who are pro-independence.  So far, the Mossos has officially agreed to follow the legitimate orders of the Spanish Government, and ignore the illegal directions of the Catalan Government.  And so far, the actions of the Mossos have been in keeping with this alignment.  However, there are some public disputes between the Mossos and the (more pro-Remain) National Guard during joint operations, and the Mossos civilian leadership have rejected the placement of the Mossos under direct centralised control (http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-41373977).  It is conceivable that some members of the Mossos will engage in passive resistance to Spanish Government orders that they disagree with.  And the Spanish Government needs to Mossos to completely shut down the vote.  So, overall ... DECREASE probability that the vote will be able to go ahead: 0.70 -> 0.60\nThe Spanish Government is increasing the pressure, but I think it is still less than 50% likely that they will actually pull the trigger on Article 155 (and they are running out of time to do the preliminary requirements if they do intend to activate Article 155), or force troops onto the street.  And anything short of that will still mean _some_ sort of vote goes ahead (because the Catalan Government will not cancel the vote themselves). NO CHANGE in the probability that, if the vote goes ahead, independence will win: 0.90\nI've seen nothing yet that would be likely to swing voters from \"Leave\" to \"Remain\" or vice versa, or to sway undecideds into one camp or another.  Use of Article 155, or of force by the Spanish Government, _would_ change this.  Otherwise, \"Remain\" will probably remain home, and refuse to take part in an \"illegal\" vote.

I don't expect  the national government to send in the army  or Guardia Civil to  physically stop people voting, but who knows they might. Its just a case of who blinks first, Spain has said it will not allow it, the Catalan Parliament has said will take place. \nRajoy (Spanish PM) is in a bind. On the face of it, allowing a legal referendum would seem the most sensible thing for him to do, because the polls show that most people in Catalonia do not want independence.  The problem is that if Catalonia is given the option of splitting from Spain then the Basque areas (Pais Vasco) would want one as well, and even towns or cities might demand the same, it could even lead to the Catalan parts of France wanting to re-unite with the Catalan parts of Spain and the Basque parts of France wanting to unite with the Basques on the Spanish side of the Pyrenese. In short a redrawing of the map. For this reason Spain and the EU would not want referendums of this type. \nAs far as similarities with Brexit are concerned I suppose there are some. There are closer similarities to the Scottish independence referendum. As Mrs May has said there are people who strongly feel that they are from somewhere specific and there are people who (as she says) who are from anywhere. It seems that \"somewhere\" people don't trust or much like people who don't identify with the same \"somewhere\". \"Anywhere\" people don't much care where people are from they just identify as having things in common with some people and having less in common with some other people, geography (and race and colour) is not a big issue. According to Boris Johnson and Mrs May its wrong for British Citizens to also feel European or part of western civilization, they should just restrict their loyalties to being British. As many of my friends and family live in other countries and/ or are citizens  of other countries this seems odd to me. As Boris (until he got a US tax demand) had duel US/UK citizenship, I find his view odd. \nIn my view all nationalism and \"independence\" \"Brexit\" etc. is more about blaming people who are not like \"us\" than rational reasoning.  Today on TV I heard  a Brexiteer call for more international cooperation to shut down IS web sites and an acknowledgement that leaving the EU would mean some cost to the economy, which would be worth it because it would mean the UK did not need to accept EU (i.e. international) rules. A naive person might think that a united EU might be better placed to deal with international terrorists than 28 separate countries would be.  Another Johnson, Dr Samuel Johnson, famously said \"patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel\", today he might have said \"nationalism is the last refuge of the desperate politician\".    \n "], [1333, "2017-09-19T14:09:57Z", [0.45, 0.0, 0.55], ""], [73, "2017-09-19T14:00:36Z", [0.5, 0.0, 0.5], ""], [36188, "2017-09-19T09:23:03Z", [0.53, 0.16, 0.31], ""], [37379, "2017-09-19T08:38:51Z", [0.75, 0.05, 0.2], ""], [38319, "2017-09-19T08:18:37Z", [0.67, 0.13, 0.2], "Spanish government appears to be slowly but steadily lining up the instruments of state against the Catalan government.

If the Catalan government tries to use that result to press ahead with independence, _then_ I think you would see Spanish troops on the streets, and mass arrests. None of this will stop a vote.  The only measure that I think will stop _any_ vote is activation of Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution, which would suspend the Catalan Government.  Once suspended, any vote that is held would be ad hoc, locally based, and would not be declared by the (now dissolved) Catalan Government.  As I understand it, activation of Article 155 needs Rajoy to give the Catalan Government due warning (http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20170919/431389589072/articulo-155-aplicacion-1o.html).

Ever since Carles Puigdemont\u2019s government called the referendum for 1 October, the central government in Madrid has been doing everything in its power to ensure that it does not happen. Madrid says the referendum is unconstitutional and so are the laws the Catalan parliament passed a week ago, which will in effect disconnect Catalonia from Spanish legislative and administrative control if the Yes vote prevails. If the Catalan government\u2019s strategy has been to provoke a reaction from Madrid, it has succeeded. While refusing to discuss the issue, the Spanish government has lashed out with a series of threats, including taking control of Catalonia\u2019s finances by 18 September and abolishing its regional autonomy. It has threatened to bar Catalan leaders from holding office and even warned them that they could face jail. The attorney general has also said that any mayor who allows local authority buildings to be used as polling stations could face prosecution. Meanwhile, mayors who say they will not facilitate the referendum are being picketed and sent hate mail by pro-secessionists. Anyone printing or distributing ballot papers or supplying ballot boxes risks prosecution, and the government has even threatened to cut off the electricity to schools serving as polling stations. It has warned postal workers against handling electoral material.

Maybe Rajoy understands that as long as there is a bigger No vote this time compared to 2014 (80% Yes), then the case to invalidate any \"win\" is stronger politically.

That, and the response it triggers in the Spanish government has the potential to massively swing how things turn out.

(2)  INCREASE probability that the CG will be able to hold an unconstitutional vote: 0.80 -> 0.90\nA few recent articles have given otherwise-ignorant me a bit of an insight into how a vote might be organised, or blocked.\nFirst, Puigdemont can only be sacked by the SG if he ignores a specific ruling of the Constitutional Court (http://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2017/09/03/533913/Spain-Catalonia-leader-referendum).  So it is hard for the SG to \"premptively strike\" at the CG to prevent _any_ vote being held.  Though, like Artur Mas, Puigedemont could well be sacked _after_ the fact.\nSecondly, while the SG can insist that Catalan public money cannot be spent holding a vote, it appears unable to actually prevent that money being spent.  It can only claim that money back through the court system.  The court case about reclaiming the costs of the 2014 vote has only just been finalised (http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-4855422/Leaders-Catalonia-enraged-tab-independence-vote.html).  And additional to that, while the money that employs the officials who would officiate at a vote comes from the SG, the officials are employed by generally-independent-minded local governments (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-05/catalonia-reaches-the-rubicon-as-rajoy-vows-no-independence-vote).  Once again, the SG may well hold the money in theory, and be able to claim it back in the long term, but it seems to have little way of completely blocking _any_ kind of vote if the CG (and the local governments) are intent on pressing ahead. (3)  INCREASE probability CG will choose to press ahead with vote: 0.90 -> 0.95\nIf anything, I think that a fall in support for independence increases the chance that the CG will press ahead with a vote in the most confrontational way possible.  Their only hope of getting a majority of Catalans on-board with independence in the next couple of years is provoking a disproportionate response from the SG, and bringing moderates and undecideds over to their side.  If they can get Spanish troops on the streets, or the SG attempting to suspend the entire CG via Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution (https://politica.elpais.com/politica/2017/09/02/actualidad/1504359069_648989.html), then the independence movement has a chance.

The Catalan government\u2019s decree officially calling the referendum is expected to be approved in the second half of August. The\u00a0Government of Spain\u00a0opposes any Catalan self-determination referendum, maintaining that the\u00a0Spanish Constitution\u00a0does not allow for a vote on the independence of any Spanish region while also deeming it as illegal without its consent; an interpretation also favoured by the not binding Catalan Statutory Guarantees Council.\nIn the absence of constitutional grounds, the Catalan government invokes the right to self-determination for calling the referendum. However, the\u00a0Council of Europe, when consulted by\u00a0Carles Puigdemont, president of Catalan government, said that any referendum must be carried out \u201cin full compliance with the constitution\u201d. So far, the Catalan government has tried but failed to get international support; in particular, Spain\u2019s European partners see Catalonia\u2019s status as a strictly internal matter. Background\nThe ballot was initially scheduled for no later than 17 September 2017, a result of an election pledge made by pro-independence parties ahead of the\u00a02015 Catalan election\u00a0(during the previous legislature, the Catalan government had held\u00a0a non-binding \"citizen participation process\"\u00a0about the question).\nThe election resulted in a\u00a0minority government\u00a0for the\u00a0Together for Yescoalition (JxS\u00ed), which had won a plurality of MPs (62 of the 135 seats), plus conditional support from the 10\u00a0CUP-CC\u00a0MPs. Shortly after the government was formed, it resolved to hold a referendum on independence. Shortly after the referendum was announced, attention focused on the issue of the\u00a0ballot boxes, since the Government of Spain is in charge of providing them, whereas for this not State-sanctioned vote, the Generalitat would have to put them in place, potentially risking prosecution for misuse of public funds. On 24 March, the Spanish Public Prosecutor's Office in Catalonia had already announced an inquiry to determine whether a referendum is in the planning.\nTendering by the Catalan government for materials such as ballot papers and envelopes for a putative regional election in the region are thought by some to be an attempt to covertly organize the referendum.\nIn terms of its organization, besides the\u00a0unconstitutionality\u00a0of the poll, the\u00a0electoral roll\u00a0is one of the main points in contention, since this is managed by the National Institute of Statistics, an autonomous organization placed under the jurisdiction of the government of Spain. To have access to its data, polls must have been authorized by the\u00a0Spanish Congress, something which is out of the question in this case.[23]Without an undisputed access to the electoral roll, the results can be deemed unreliable. Similar difficulties could be met when it comes to the\u00a0electoral commission\u00a0to be formed for monitoring the polling and results. An official announcement by the Generalitat suggested that Catalan residents overseas willing to vote would have to register. By the end of June 2017, out of 285,000 Catalans living abroad and eligible to vote, 5,000 had registered. Tensions within the Catalan government\nOn July 3, president Puigdemont sacked his Minister for Enterprise,\u00a0Jordi Baiget, who, in the face of the legal challenges, had just expressed doubts regarding the referendum taking place as envisioned by the Catalan government. Then, on July 14, Puigdemont proceeded with a\u00a0cabinet reshuffle, replacing three additional ministers in his cabinet (the ones responsible for Presidency, Education and Interior) in a move widely seen as a removal of the remainder hesitant voices within his cabinet in regards to the referendum issue. On July 17, the\u00a0Catalan police\u00a0chief resigned without giving any reason. The regional police force is seen as key to enforcing any court orders sought by the Spanish government challenging the secession vote. Additional isolated resignations have been noted among some of the high-level civil servants potentially playing a role with the vote's organization. Economic repercussions\nAs of August 2017 the\u00a0spread\u00a0between Spanish 10-year government debt and German bonds was close to its narrowest in seven years; however, since the start of July the yield on the Catalan government\u2019s bonds had jumped by about 50 basis points, signaling unease among investors in regards to the referendum. Pollsters generally started using the proposed referendum question (\"Do you want Catalonia to be an independent state in the form of a republic?\") after it was revealed in early June 2017. The Opinion Studies Center (CEO) polled respondents on their intentions rather than asking them the actual referendum question. In its March 2017 poll, aside from asking respondents whether they would want Catalonia to become an independent state, it asked their intents in the event of a referendum on the independence of Catalonia being called and organized by the Generalitat without agreement from the Spanish Government.

My thoughts on the various subquestions follows.  \"In light of the attacks ...\" *  Will Catalan and Spanish governments be more or less likely to negotiate a legitimate referendum?  Perhaps very slightly _less_, as Spanish government less willing to be \"distracted\" by Catalan independence issues.  Not enough change to bother modifying forecast.\n*  If there is a legitimate referendum, will independence be more or less likely to win?  Less.  However, not enough to shift overall percentage of this outcome by more than 1%.\n*  If there is no successful negotiation between the CG and SG, will the CG be more or less able to hold a public vote?  No change.\n*  If the CG is _able_ to hold a vote in defiance of the SG, will they be more or less likely to choose to have a vote?  Significantly less.  Any attempt by the CG to promote an October 1st vote for the next couple of weeks will be seen to be tasteless.   So the likelihood of the vote being deferred must have jumped, potentially until 2018.  Given the falling support for independence in polls, a deferral \"because of the terrorist attacks\" also gives a face-saving out for those in favour of independence tho think the timing is wrong.  Overall, probability of JxSi choosing to hold a public vote down from 90% to 70%.\n*  If non-binding vote is held by CG, will independence be more or less likely to win?  Less.  I think that \"remain\" voters would be a little more likely to turn out to register their disgust at JxSi pushing a vote despite the attacks, rather than remain at home.  Independence win down from 95% to 80%. Net effect: Deferral of vote into 2018 much more likely, a \"no\" vote somewhat more likely.

They know that even if the \"yes\" vote won the illegal result would not stand and before it was really decided to give Catalonia independence another legal referendum in which they could vote \"no\" would need to be held.  \nhttps://elpais.com/elpais/2017/08/13/opinion/1502635109_453757.html"], [691, "2017-08-14T16:52:54Z", [0.49, 0.1, 0.41], ""], [38268, "2017-08-14T10:19:12Z", [0.4, 0.05, 0.55], "Vote will be unofficial and challenged by Spanish government"], [35398, "2017-08-14T04:21:54Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [21290, "2017-08-14T03:19:20Z", [0.63, 0.25, 0.12], "i am catalan. and I see that the governement of catalonia will do whatever it takes to do the referendum"], [37006, "2017-08-14T01:37:31Z", [0.55, 0.25, 0.2], ""], [368, "2017-08-13T13:39:54Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [691, "2017-08-13T12:34:55Z", [0.59, 0.1, 0.31], ""], [36188, "2017-08-13T11:44:07Z", [0.33, 0.27, 0.4], "I think the main question here is whether the vote will be legal or not.
