The RAND safety expectation versus the Google reported driven miles suggest an announcement today would indicate a risk appetite for Google. Recently, Google has lost key autonomous vehicle engineers, executives and several other AV leaders.  Job postings to replace these people are posted.  My first thought is young talented professionals want to be part of a progressive organization with a vision that will be realized before they turn 40.  Google may be taking the risk aversion route and allowing Uber and others take on the Risk.

Also considering Google (GOOG) stock price near all time highs, uncertainty of the FED and GOOG monthly chart indicating distribution I suspect an announcement could come in the next couple weeks.
