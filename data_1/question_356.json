At the very least, DON'T raise rates!  This is supported by their announcement to leave rates at \"present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of net asset purchases\" (NAP runs till at least December 2017). I'm leaning towards Maintain because I've been relatively convinced by the argument that the ECB is interested in using other strategies rather than cutting rates to achieve the stimulus it wants to achieve.  Negative deposit rates have started to create phenomena we haven't seen before (see Economist article) and many believe the ECB is slightly worried about the effects the negative interest rates are having (e.g. costs of deposit rate passed onto consumers).  I think that Draghi still sees conventional interest rate manipulation as a valid strategy but not right now. Inside View - I'm not sure I have time to do this, but someone ought to do some sort of analysis into the language Draghi uses at his press conferences and whether we can intimate any details of future announcements from previous ones.  Did his language at the December announcement belie any information for the January conference?   The text on the web that I quoted above is non-committal either way.
