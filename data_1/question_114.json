Russia has shown signs in recent days, particularly when it comes to Ukraine, that it is willing to compromise. On Tuesday, representatives from the Donetsk and Luhansk people's republics, the separatist territories that Russia backs in eastern Ukraine, announced that they would postpone their local elections, scheduled for this week, until July 24. Ostensibly, the delay will allow more time for negotiations. The West and the Ukrainian government in Kiev have both maintained that elections should wait until necessary security components of the Minsk peace agreement have been implemented.

No one is going to militarily remove Russia from Crimea and, in classic Russian strategy, wants a buffer in Ukraine and extends military base Voronezh.\nIf they have a Donetsk election during the Ukraine political transition, Russia perhaps is accused of a coup and given reasons by opponents to impose sanctions.

Examining how these groups have behaved with regard to negotiation in the past and now. Some factors include: military success Eastern Ukraine, economic strength at home, political strength at home, political influence abroad and economic influence abroad. Each of these counted as 1 point.  My model multiplies the number of points for each actor times .2 to determine the willingness to negotiate (taking into consideration whether strength or weakness makes an actor more or less willing to negotiate).  Last I averaged the pro-Donbas scores (giving their average a weight of 2) and averaged the anti-Donbas scores (with a weight of 1), and then divided by 3. This then gave me an estimated probability of a negotiated agreement in Ukraine.\nBut then I took the statistic that 25% of all civil wars end in negotiation as my Bayesian prior. This lowers my prediction to 20%. I take this as an estimate for a year, making the probability per month 1.6. Since two months remain in the question, this gives a 3% chance of a negotiated settlement occurring.  I took this as a base, and added in the fact that Leader of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic in eastern Ukraine Alexander Zakharchenko said in February that he did not expect local elections in the DPR until 2017.  I thus decreased the possibility to 2%, leaving open a small amount of probability for the unforeseen.\n"], [20031, "2016-03-04T16:16:29Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [601, "2016-03-04T15:56:38Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [24, "2016-03-04T14:37:14Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "Raising NO to 100%, largely in repsonse to this\nhttp://www.rferl.org/content/france-germany-ukraine-russian-diplomats-aim-election-eastern-ukraine-midyear-minsk-accord/27588523.html International pressures to get elections held in the DNR and LNR by \"mid-year\" - with June being specifically mentioned as the intended date.

Prior to that report, Ukraine claims they saw the highest number of attacks recorded since August, 2015 (Ibid).  The Ukraine government is becoming more divided and dysfunctional, causing doubt as to whether the agreements it made with Russia will continue after an inevitable shake up of leadership in the administration (Doff, 2016).  A weak and divided government works as much to Russia's goals as a Russian  backed Ukraine. The corruption has not disappeared in the Western backed Ukraine government, further preventing Ukraine from becoming a central and effective  authority (\"Ambassador: France supports Ukraine, but will not hide truth,\" 2016). They are 130 of 168 in the corruption index, next to Russia (Transparency International, n.d.). Ukraine is becoming less an issue and more a financial and resource burden (Doff, 2016) for Europe whose attention has moved to the refugees, and terrorism. \nIf there is no election due to uncertainty and instability, the worst case scenario within reason is a censure of Russia by the West and a sanction and a promise to have an election when the area is secure to do so in the non-NATO and non-EU country. A non-vote gives Russia more leverage in a region that will vote for Russia or is militarily superior army in Donetsk.   A pre-mature vote and a victory gives Russia nothing else to leverage and a green light for Western Ukraine to become by default a more Western ally. As in the case of Iran and the Russian built nuclear plant which took almost 20 years to build (World Nuclear News, 2014), delaying the goal gives Russia leverage than if they complete a Ukraine agreement.

The next best thing for Moscow having more influence in Ukraine is for Ukraine to have a dysfunctional government. It is not so much the election, which is an 'absolute' decision, with little room to maneuver after the vote, but what is gained from the concept of discussing a future election. Or, as T S Eliot wrote: Between the idea\nAnd the reality\nBetween the motion\nAnd the act\nFalls the Shadow There are light military skirmishes in the disputed East areas and the political disagreements, or horse trading, continues between Kiev and Moscow and the pro-Russian factions.  Ukrainian members of the Minsk Trilateral group believe the Steinmeier Forumula is 'unrealistic.'  Alexander Zakharchenko says that no Ukrainian parties are permitted in the Donbas elections. President Poroshenko wants a return of prisoners, a pullback of Russians and weapons, a resolution on displaced persons, and a ceasefire.  However, if the Russians agree to follow the Minsk Agreement in following the norm of the Ukraine elections, then Russia could equally have access to a questionable and corrupt election strategy in Donbas.  These are long ,dragging, expectations from all parties and as these demands become a  lengthened stalemate; it becomes an elephant in the room. It becomes an elephant in the room for Europe which cannot complete a plan for Ukraine without thinking, but what of the East, how does that effect the EU's strategic and commercial agreements with Kyiv and Russia? The Ukraine economy is slowing and loans are due and the conflict in the East is both reducing funds and resources for the EU, Ukraine, Russia and the global banks.  This is more of a discussion between the US and Russia than with the EU. I do not think that Ukraine is a high priority for the US as it would rather Russia turn its attention to Ukraine and spend its resources and funding on that conflict, the way Russia involved itself in forcing the US to turn more attention and resources in the conflicts it had in Afghanistan and Iraq when backing Iran and other US opponents in the wars. In other words, payback is fair play. But Russia believes it needs Ukraine as a buffer whereas the EU has less a need for them as a strategic defense in the Northern European plain.  For Russia, it goes beyond  political support.  However, this stasis conflict could also work for Russia's advantage in breakaway and factional areas such as Transdneister or Moldova or South Ossetia where any perceived provocation against Russia in Ukraine could have repercussions in the spring within and beyond the Ukrainian disputed region.  As long as Russia hangs the Eastern disputed region out to dry, the non-NATO Ukraine hangs in the shadow with it.

This means that Moscow will NOT allow the conflict-regions to hold elections because \"elections could have derailed efforts, redoubled in recent weeks, to forge a lasting settlement to the...conflict\" http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/67a5bc68-6c3e-11e5-aca9-d87542bf8673.html#axzz3xwphCEhZ (slightly dated, yes - argument is still 100% valid, however). \nThe rebels will do nothing without Russia's go-ahead. Certainly not elections. This rules out holding elections that Ukraine will not recognize (thus, the 0% chance given to the NOREC option).  It therefore comes down to how quickly negotiations will take place. Right now, they're \"stalled\"\nhttp://sputniknews.com/europe/20160122/1033528400/ukraine-contact-group-results.html . Moscow's terms are for Ukraine to have a permanent (not transitional) constitution that gives the breakaway regions autonomy.

If this is the case (and it may be the case), then the conflict will become \"frozen\" (like in Ossetia, Abkhazia and Transnistria). Elections may eventually take place, but not soon (and not within the time-frame specified by the question).  If the negotiations between Russia and the US are genuine (as seems to be the case), then the United States will have to put enough pressure on an unruly Kievan government to install a permanent constitution with autonomy clauses that appease Russia. Russia will then want to see \n1. The constitution implemented\n2.

In short: I believe that either \n1. Elections will not take place within the given span of time \n2.
