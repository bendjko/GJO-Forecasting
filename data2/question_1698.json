Electric cars, known in China as new energy vehicles (NEVs), will be driving the ambitious growth agenda in the world\u2019s largest automotive market for the next five years. Putting more NEVs on China\u2019s roads fulfil several policy objectives at once: besides stimulating domestic consumption to support the economic recovery, the push for electrification - where one in five vehicles in circulation is an NEV - also contributes to President Xi Jinping\u2019s target of making China carbon neutral by 2060. To promote the switch to electrification, China\u2019s central government and local authorities are providing a slew of tax incentives to encourage carmakers to assemble NEVs, cash subsidies to make NEVs affordable to consumers and policy stimulus to accelerate technological innovation in the sector. The total number of NEVs - inclusive of all-electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids and fuel-cell vehicles - may balloon to 5.42 million units by 2025, from last year\u2019s 1.17 million, according to research by the global market research firm International Data Corporation.  NEV sales may jump to 20 per cent of all new car sales by 2025, up to one in every two new cars sold by 2035, from just 5 per cent now, according to a forecast by the China Society of Automotive Engineers (CSAE). Carmakers are already rushing to roll out new designs with ever-further driving range to convince consumers to ditch their internal combustion engines (ICEs) for electric vehicles. Of the 785 new models unveiled in September at the Beijing Auto Show, 160 - or one in every five - was an electric model. The ultimate goal of NEVs is the battery-powered automobile (BEV) with zero emissions at the point of use, also the shared focus of many automotive start-ups, according to The Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank. Battery-driven cars will make up 95 per cent of NEV sales in 2045, with hybrids making up the rest, the CSAE said. Tesla still holds a strong position in the race for electric vehicle leadership in China with the early introduction of its Model Y this year to a rousing reception. \nBut three of the most exciting start-ups churning out NEVs to challenge Tesla are Chinese companies listed in New York and Nasdaq stock exchanges: NIO and Li Auto both based in Beijing, and Xpeng of Guangzhou.  They count some of China\u2019s largest technology behemoths like Alibaba Group Holding and Tencent Holdings as their financial backers. \nThe growth in demand for NEVs is attracting more companies to join the fray. Huawei Technologies, Baidu and Foxconn, and the traditional makers of ICEs such as Volvo Cars\u2019 owner Geely Automobile Holdings, General Motors, Volkswagen and BMW have all unveiled their plans to bring decades of car making experience and the dozens of models at their disposal into the NEV industry."], [88783, "2021-02-06T14:53:25Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.12, 0.49, 0.39], ""], [94872, "2021-02-06T02:46:35Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.11, 0.48, 0.41], ""], [691, "2021-02-05T17:24:49Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.29, 0.51, 0.2], ""], [84880, "2021-02-05T03:26:23Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.49, 0.5], "Minimum 2.21 mil if flat sales.
