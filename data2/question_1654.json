In the same time frame, there were 636 \"Intubations COVID\". Even under consideration of an increased discharge for four days (07 July:543; 08 July:538; 09 July:512; 10 July: 541. Compare to 05 July: 475; 06 July: 424) this does not really explain how they managed to have 35 ICU beds per day (!) at hand for an \"excess in intubations over fatalities\" without seeing the number of total ICU beds increase. It's magic. (Discharges are patients with milder symptoms in approx. 80% of the cases, patients from the Inpatient-, ED-cohort).\n/The solution must lie in the rebranding of beds in the Emergency Department, without adding them to the count of total ICU beds, even though these beds had the same functionalities. The single highest jump in the number of \"Patients seen in the Emergency Department (ED)\" in the \"COVID-19-ED\" tab under \"Hospital COVID-19 Specific Metrics\" happened:\non 07 July 2020 (2,008), up from 1,385 on 06 July 2020.\nThis number remained higher than the 06 July value every single day until 18 July 2020, while an estimated staggering number of 3,850 additional patients have been seen in the ED. Considering the fact that on 07 July 2020 there were just 145 ICU beds available and it at that specific day only took 61 additional ICU patients to hit the threshold of 95% capacity, one must conclude that hospitals in Arizona - by general standards - ran at 100% or higher of capacity on every single day between 07 July 2020 and 18 July 2020. The only exceptions here will be a few hospitals in the counties Graham, Greenlee and La Paz.\n/This is what is called \"Crisis standards of care\", which was enacted in Arizona in the beginning of July 2020 and will have been effective on 07 July 2020. The topic of data reliability is raised here: https://www.propublica.org/article/how-many-people-in-the-us-are-hospitalized-with-covid-19-who-knows Instead of providing better information to the public, the move on by the so called \"Coronavirus Task Force\" of 10 July 2020 only made things worse. The data collected from the HHS reveals, for instance, that coverage of reporting  of hispital beds in use is low, according to healthdata.gov, the data outlet of the HHS  https://healthdata.gov/dataset/covid-19-reported-patient-impact-and-hospital-capacity-state/resource/38e07d07-40a2-4749#{query:{filters:[{type:!term,field:!state,term:!az}]},view-grid:{hiddenColumns:[!inpatient_beds,!inpatient_beds_coverage,!inpatient_beds_used,!inpatient_beds_used_coverage,!inpatient_beds_utilization,!inpatient_beds_utilization_coverage,!inpatient_beds_utilization_numerator,!inpatient_beds_utilization_denominator],columnsWidth:[{column:!state,width:159},{column:!inpatient_beds,width:179},{column:!inpatient_beds_coverage,width:275},{column:!inpatient_beds_used,width:208},{column:!adult_icu_bed_covid_utilization_numerator,width:474},{column:!adult_icu_bed_covid_utilization_denominator,width:482},{column:!adult_icu_bed_utilization,width:260},{column:!adult_icu_bed_utilization_coverage,width:385},{column:!adult_icu_bed_utilization_numerator,width:423},{column:!adult_icu_bed_utilization_denominator,width:413},{column:!reporting_cutoff_start,width:195},{column:!entry_id,width:102}]}} \"Inpatient beds used COVID Coverage\": 86%\n\"Staffed Adult ICU Bed Occupancy Coverage\":62%\n\"Percent of Inpatients with COVID Coverage\": 69% [Percent of Inpatients with COVID Coverage numerator: 1932) \"Adult ICU bed COVID Utilization Coverage\": 50%\n\"Adult ICU bed COVID Utilization Coverage Numerator\": 452\n\"Adult ICU bed COVID Utilization Coverage Denominator\": 1049\n\"Adult ICU bed Utilization\": 0.83984747...\n\"Adult ICU bed Utilization Coverage\": 52%\n\"Adult ICU bed Utilization Numerator\": 881\n\"Adult ICU bed Utilization Denominator\": 1049\n\"Reporting Cutoff\": 2020-07-27 Why is there a reporting cutoff on 27 July 2020? What happened to the data after that day? What is especially revealing: the HHS statistics cover only 1,049 or 52% of all Adult ICU beds. This means in total there must be at least 2,017 of them.\nOn 27 July 2020 ADHS reported 1,433 adult ICU beds in use, 272 adult ICU beds available (which totals 1,705, at a ratio of 84.05% for utilization.\nThe Healthdata.gov data now suggest there are 2017 or more adult ICU beds in Arizona, 312 more than state health official reported on, \"covered\"... Even though their coverage rate is at 84.53% (1,705 out of 2017 beds covered), it's not a full coverage of 100%. It's just a bit less bad than the data provided by the HHS. Strangely, the two different coverage ratios\n50% for \"Adult ICU bed COVID Utilization Coverage\" and\n52% for \"Adult ICU bed Utilization Coverage\",\nby using the same denominator of 1,049, as they do, this implies an even higher total of Adult ICU beds in Arizona of 2,098 an a secret reserve of 81 beds they have, build as needed, or just make up in order to prevent the statistics from being as bad. If this is true, no wonder the \"Adult Intensive Care Unit Beds Available\"-ratio could never fall below the 8.62% as of 07 July 2020, if there exist beds that go uncovered, and there exist 81 phantom beds."], [68688, "2020-08-06T22:21:55Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [52131, "2020-08-06T20:42:20Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [94837, "2020-08-06T19:06:45Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [75863, "2020-08-06T16:28:54Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [691, "2020-08-06T16:26:52Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [93565, "2020-08-06T09:47:05Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [93565, "2020-08-06T09:46:26Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], "Comment deleted on Aug 06, 2020 09:47AM UTC"], [21884, "2020-08-06T01:55:33Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [62808, "2020-08-06T00:37:45Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [57400, "2020-08-05T23:15:49Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [75863, "2020-08-05T19:32:53Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [13974, "2020-08-05T17:41:49Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [88422, "2020-08-05T17:37:48Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [80764, "2020-08-05T17:14:25Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [93087, "2020-08-05T15:42:35Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [91903, "2020-08-05T12:52:35Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [86710, "2020-08-04T23:43:56Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [691, "2020-08-04T14:29:23Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [75863, "2020-08-04T14:00:11Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [62808, "2020-08-03T22:01:02Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [94792, "2020-08-03T21:23:57Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [88452, "2020-08-03T19:00:10Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [57778, "2020-08-03T13:28:47Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [783, "2020-08-03T06:52:01Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [19127, "2020-08-03T06:18:51Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [93310, "2020-08-03T04:30:16Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "85% as of August 1st.

Quote from linked article (https://www.thedailybeast.com/arizona-doctors-say-gov-doug-ducey-steered-state-into-covid-19-surge): One ICU physician in Tucson, who asked not to be named for fear of employer retaliation, said the official numbers actually underplayed the severity of the crisis. When hospitals reported that 90 percent of their ICU beds and half of their ventilators were in use, the physician said, those numbers included the extra beds and machines they\u2019d brought in for the pandemic. If those percentages ever reached 100, there would be no feasible way for the hospital to scale up. \u201cIf you were going by our pre-COVID capacity, we would be actually operating at 120 percent of capacity,\u201d the physician said, adding that the hospital where they work had run out of its own ventilator supply and was now using those supplied by FEMA."], [13974, "2020-07-17T17:06:29Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.09, 0.9], ""], [92357, "2020-07-17T15:55:23Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.15, 0.85], ""], [86785, "2020-07-17T14:59:26Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.11, 0.87], ""], [691, "2020-07-17T14:49:57Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95], "Not sure where they're putting the sick folks, but not in Arizona ICU beds."], [56128, "2020-07-17T13:41:52Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.9], "The governor is in hiding, being in AZ, the data does not reflect the current condition of the hospitals.

But it is unclear though: the graphic does not contain numbers and it only shows from April 1 onwards. Right now Arizona is still increasing their numbers of ICU beds: 1730 as of today. Thus for this question to be closed, we would need 1644 occupied beds. The question is the following: are they aiming for a fixed minimum percentage of free ICU beds or for a free minimum number of free ICU beds? I would say that it would be easier to aim for the second: the number of free beds have been moving from 150-200 during the last two weeks, despite the fact that the number of occupied ICU beds have reached yesterday a new record (1556). However it is also true that we have been stuck at the 10% level (of free ICU beds) for the last two weeks.

Some of these cases seem to have been put to the ICU afterwards, as the number of \"ICU Beds for COVID-19\" have inclined more sharply after 02 July 2020 than before (723 on 01 July 2020; 741 on 02 July 2020; 796 on 03 July 2020; 821 on 04 July 2020). This is maybe a replication of the observation from Texas medical system, where patients come to see a doctor first very (almost too) late, when symptoms and lack of oxigen have become harmful and ICU treatment is mandatory. As a consequence, the relation of ICU Beds (COVID-19)/ED patients (COVID-19) seems to increase over time, which suggests increasingly scarce ICU beds.\nAs the number of \"Intubations Performed for Respiratory Distress\" have been about 60 per day on average between 20 June 2020 and 02 July 2020, I'd say on 03/04 July 2020 alone there have been more than 90 additional (above average) intubations, which will block an ICU bed in the short term, as the recovery from COVID-19 will take at least two weeks, once an intubation has become necessary. If this trend in intubations continues, it will be ever harder to discharge patients from ICU beds soon.\nEven when the number of \"COVID-19 Patients Discharged from the hospital\" is rising (which also just reflects the increase in \"Inpatient  COVID-19 patients\"), my guess is the discharge which has peaked on 04 July 2020 may not be enough to keep patients from being stuck to 95% (or rather 96%) of ICU beds very soon.

So I'm just using that. Around 3 weeks ago it was 79-80% and today it's 90-91%. So I'll call that 11% in 21 days, ~0.5% / day. We need 4-5% more to get there, which would put a midpoint of my estimate at around 8-10 days from now, or roughly July 13-15. The variance around this trend isn't that big. The biggest daily swings are around 2-3% with a strong reversion to the mean.  So at this point  Before July 9: 10% not impossible but getting to be long odds I think.

Also having beds is one thing, but staffing those beds is another. => the governor etc will fight like hell to avoid this scenario\n2) Arizona has shown that they can expand ICU capacity and I assume they are going nuts to bring more beds on line.\n3) the curve for Arizona keeps going up, so I see no reason to believe there is a peak coming soon enough to prevent passing 5%. \n4) discharges don't necessarily mean that patients got better. I assume these could be discharges from ICU to regular beds, LTACs or SNFs.  @ManuPV @Jayce @Anneinak @pstamp "], [85984, "2020-07-05T18:21:44Z", [0.0, 0.02, 0.02, 0.02, 0.94], "Dropped to 89 % today as the denominator, namely the ICU capacity number looks like it's increasing. \nFolks this isn't happening.

Although it might trigger additional funding to have capacity filled to a certain level. It's hard to know the incentives in play. It's noteworthy that a month ago they thought they would be full by July and authorized additional beds which they haven't needed. This is more evidence things are slowing down.

I don't have any idea what beta is, so I've \"backed it out\" here by using a range of estimates for R0 based on a subjective reading of recent history."], [57778, "2020-07-02T00:19:29Z", [0.0, 0.43, 0.3, 0.02, 0.25], ""], [86785, "2020-07-01T23:50:46Z", [0.0, 0.11, 0.16, 0.13, 0.6], ""], [38, "2020-07-01T23:07:47Z", [0.0, 0.51, 0.25, 0.04, 0.2], ""], [92379, "2020-07-01T22:14:06Z", [0.0, 0.95, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2020-07-01T19:12:36Z", [0.0, 0.55, 0.25, 0.2, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2020-07-01T19:09:39Z", [0.0, 0.65, 0.25, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [89135, "2020-07-01T18:52:45Z", [0.0, 0.95, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0], "Going back to my original after it jumped from 86% yesterday to 89% today.

I think it's fairly unlikely this was thanks to traffic from us, but Arizonans have greater need of this data than we do...] ANTICIPATED CRITICAL CASE LOAD: In other contexts, 5-8% of cases become critically ill.[1] These figures come from earlier outbreaks (e.g. Wuhan), and probably overestimate given under-ascertainment of mild/asymptomatic infections (cf. why raw case fatality ratios typically overestimate the infection fatality ratio for COVID-19. A dumb correction for this would be ~3%, highly sensitive to how avidly AZ tests (which I only have vague steers on - more later). 3% of ~1600 cases (the daily figure on June 12) gives 48 new expected critical cases, or 5% of ICU capacity. You would not need many of these days (~4) to exhaust present ICU capacity on this assumption (especially given how epi curves and reporting lags work, meaning one probably shouldn't expect this rising trend to reverse immediately) TIME LAGS TO PRESENTATION Hospitalizations for COVID-19 in AZ in the last few days were not huge (IIRC the graph before the dashboard went down, it was on a downward trend). I fear this is falsely reassuring due to expected lag times. Incubation periods average 5-6 days, and time from symptom onset to critical illness ~~9 days. The two upshots are 1) if there is indeed a surge in infections, you would not expect this to translate into critical cases immediately (thus the regrettable expectation the benign trends in hospitalizations etc. will reverse); 2) If most testing is screening on asymptomatic individuals (cf. the drive-thrus), this expected burden of critical cases may arise later - either pushing probability in the second time period versus the first, and giving time for AZ to respond by expanding ICU capacity (more later). ALAS PROBABLY NOT AN ARTEFACT OF TESTING MORE AZ has ramped up testing, including the use of serology tests (which can potentially pick up those who were infected and have recovered). One hope would be therefore that the apparent surge in positive tests is owed to these things rather than increasing incidence of infection.  Unfortunately, it does not seem a lot of the apparent surge can be attributed to this: 1) serology tests are the minority, so the numbers cannot be heavily inflated by recovered infections (which is in any case upper-bounded by some time-lagged prevalence); 2) % positives for PCR are rising - you would expect this proportion to fall if the increased cases were owed to increased testing rather than increased incidence. RESPONSE EFFICACY Media reports indicate AZ state gov concern and attempt to mitigate (e.g. hospitals activating emergency plans). Regrettably I am pessimistic on how effective this can prove, although more uncertainty attaches to how this is reported. The responses I see are these: a) preserving present capacity (e.g. cancelling elective operations); b) triage; c) expanding critical care capacity; d) reducing incidence a: One can 'free up' ICU beds by eliminating elective demand. This only gets you so far - there are many reasons besides COVID-19 for non-elective ICU admissions. My impression 'back in the day' was also these tended to be shorter stay (and so this may have already happened leaving limited further room to manoeuvre). b: Triaging ICU could effectively increase available capacity, by declining to escalate treatment for patients least likely to benefit. I think this is a minor factor: firstly, as if ICUs were heavily overdemanded, one would not leave 5% of available beds idle; secondly, my impression is the clinical ethos in the US is particularly loathe to limit care for a patient for reasons 'outside' their clinical condition, so I doubt there will be a lot of pre-emptive triage to preserve capacity for an anticipated influx of critically ill. c: Hospital emergency responses typically include means of expanding critical care resources, through a mix of reassigning staff, repurposing clinical areas, and so on. Thus the denominator of ICU beds available could increase. Yet i) these tend not to be hugely impressive - maybe a small multiple, and typically needing weeks to spin up; ii) it's not clear whether this 'improvised capacity' (e.g. if you open a 'CPAP/HFNO' ward for severely ill cases) would be counted as ICU beds. In any case, if you get to this stage ICU is typically full (cf. Lombardy, etc.)  MISC Listing qualitative considerations either way then reading tea-leaves to aggregate them is typically not a great forecasting technique. I'd like to evaluate other places more carefully to get a clearer sense on how to benchmark these considerations. I expect there will be a lot more resolution in the next few days with data on hospitalizations etc. I'd expect my guesses in these buckets to change by 20+%. I am surprised at the crowd putting a lot of mass in buckets 1m+ away. The likely outcomes seem more bimodal to me.\n\n[1] https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-critical-care-and-airway-management-issues?sectionName=CLINICAL%20FEATURES%20IN%20CRITICALLY%20ILL%20PATIENTS&topicRef=126981&anchor=H1984494400&source=see_link\n"], [90868, "2020-06-13T03:50:36Z", [0.05, 0.25, 0.3, 0.3, 0.1], ""], [89882, "2020-06-13T02:17:22Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.4, 0.6], ""], [90836, "2020-06-13T02:09:32Z", [0.8, 0.15, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0], "Coronavirus cases in Arizona have nearly doubled in the past two weeks, and the media is reporting that hospitals are currently at 84% capacity.

If we also assume no existing beds free up nor additional capacity is added, that means 5% of the total 1,665 beds is ~83 beds. Those 83 beds removed from the remaining 337 beds as of June 11th implies 254 beds would need to be used to get to the 5% level. That shows us there are still 29 additional beds available or two more days of available capacity above the 5% level. All this said, intubations aren\u2019t the same thing as ICU bed usage to my knowledge. I\u2019d assume ICU bed usage is slightly higher than intubations. And, the current rate of hospitalizations in Arizona appears to be increasing at this time. Additionally, it often takes quite some time for people to come out of ICU once they\u2019re admitted, so the rate of already utilized beds becoming available is likely to decrease. So, we could easily see those additional 29 beds used within that time frame. The only caveat I\u2019d like to add is that excess capacity being added is a game changer.
