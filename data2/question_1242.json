Out of the 2nd debate lineup [1], 10 have qualified to the third debate [2]. I assume all have a 0% chance of dropping out now. Three have dropped out. That leaves 7 candidates left:\n- Steyer\n- Gabbard\n- Williamson\n- de Blasio\n- Bullock\n- Bennet\n- Delaney Delaney [3] and Bullock [4] have vowed to stay in the race. I conservatively assume 3% chance of counting for this question. Williamson is getting the national attention that supposedly motivated her to run, so I assume the chances are very low, 5%. Steyer is largely self-funded which gives his campaigns plenty of oxygen even if he doesn't qualify for the debates and allows him to harbor hopes that they may break out eventually. Steyer came close to qualifying for the 3rd debate [4] and may qualify for the 4th. I would assign a 3% chance of dropping out. That leaves Gabbard, de Blasio and Bennet. More research is required on these three. @Chrisp provides some valuable insights here [5]. In particular, Chrisp argues that de Blasio needs the platform. Let's assume 20% for him. Both Gabbard and Bennet had relatively large amount of fundraising cash on hand at the beginning of July [6] (relative to other minor candidates, although this is not a great metric. Let's assume 50% for each of them. According to this analysis, there is 41% chance that two or more candidates will drop out. @Anneinak, you mentioned you've read some candidates have committed to staying tin the race longer? Have I covered them? Are there any others?

I did think inslee was on the way out, as I've posted in my last few predictions.  I know that most people, with 2 out, will be shifting to 3-4.    But that feels pre-mature to me.  It is still very early in the primary season.   We are still what .. 6 months earlier than the republican debates last cycle?   Also, both Trump, Obama showed that TV is not the sine-qua-non it once was.    The requirements for the October debate are the same as for the September debate.   People that are hitting the donors numbers will have cash to continue.  So - my inclination is to go all in  on 1-2.  Ie, no more will drop out prior to the debate. \nThe qualifying date is Wednesday- but Finding out the dates of the qualifying polls would solidify that for me, but so far, no joy.  On the chopping block for the most likely to drop:  Gillibrand and Ryan. \nGillibrand has been absolutely embarassing.  What this campaign has exposed is the fact that being appointed to position, she has no debate skills, no campaigning skills.    On the larger, strategic front she is a clintonista, and a new-yorker.  In other words, she does very little to bring people outside the typical democrats over.   Does nothing for the ticket. \nAs she won re-election in 2018, she has absolutely no pressure to drop out.   Gillibrand is short on the donors and 3 polls short of qualifying.  But no real pressure.  Daughter/grand daughter of the Albany Democrat machine. My gut feel is that Gillibrand is an opportunist, running for vice-president.    But to be considered for VP - she has to get more votes, more eye-balls.  She's in till she runs out of money... Tim Ryan - very different story.   Ran as an underdog - and won.   Of course, it did help that the incumbent was in jail.   District is solidly democrat.   Ohio is a swing state - and winning it would drive a dagger into Trump's re-election plans.   He opposed Nancy Pelosi for speaker - which can't make life in the House comfortable, Pelosi notoriously holding grudges.  Final comments:  Bennet:  Bennet will benefit from Hickenlooper voters, and as of today, I make him likely to make October after missing September.   Bennet also has superb staff with strong ties to the DCCC.  So.  92-8.  And all in on 1-2 next friday if no one else drop out.  \nConfidence: 20% (highly variable, no actual data/insight into the campaigns.)

Realistically O'Rourke seems unlikely to drop out given he's gone on the offense against Trump on gun reform and been making a big public push there.

To be on the next debate stage, candidates must have more than 2% support in at least four national polls or polls from early-voting states, such as Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina. The candidates must also raise funds from at least 130,000 individual donors and show that they have 400 unique donors from at least 20 different states. All qualifying donations must be made before August 28 and must be endorsed by DNC-approved donation tools such as ActBlue. \nDemocratic candidates are introduced before the second of two Democratic presidential primary debates...\nAP Photo/Carlos Osorio\nDemocratic candidates are introduced before the second of two Democratic presidential primary debates hosted by CNN this week.

A spokesman for Mr. Steyer said he was \u201con track to collect the required number of donors to make the September debate stage\u201d but did not give a number.

It's not about how many candidates will qualify for the 3rd round of debates, but how many will withdraw or suspend their campaigns.  Oops!   The DNC deadline is Aug 28th; this question asks \"as of Sept 12th\", 2 weeks later.  The question I'm asking myself now is, how many of the candidates that don't make the cut for the 3rd debate will withdraw in the  2 weeks after the debate participation deadline?

To make this forecast, I make some additional assumptions: Argument/Method #1 (Base Rates) * Let's assume the race started in July (more precisely what I mean is that dropping out begins to be a possibility in July). That's 7 months to the caucuses. \n* In total there were 21 candidates. 1 has already dropped out (Salwell)\n* For now, I assume linear trend in candidate-drop-out per month This suggests there will be 7 drop outs by the first caucuses (assuming they are in Feb) (68% confidence interval of 5-9 and 95% of 2-11), and using the linear assumption, there would be 1 per month (95% interval is 0-2 roughly speaking). This is consistent with what we observed in July. Argument/Method #2 (another historical perspective) The previous method is agnostic to the schedule of the actual race. It is important to acknowledge that this race is occurring sooner than in the past ( the debates are taking place sooner, perhaps owing to the large candidate field).\n\nIn the 2016 GOP primary (the closest historical analog in terms of the large number of candidates), the drop-outs were: 2 in September, 1 in November, and 2 in December. [2] Two candidates had dropped out by the beginning of the 3rd debate [4]. This is consistent with my numbers above. Argument/Method #3 (Inside View) This candidate field larger than any in my historical data set and we have to acknowledge that a larger field will see more drop outs (there is only so much donor money to go around and support to garner).  Most haven't yet qualified for the third debate. [3] On the other hand, why would a candidate drop out this early? For candidates that are clearly behind, is participation in the debate absolutely necessary to fulfill the goals they had when joining the race:\n* raising ones profile for e.g. a Senate run - My impression there is plenty of time to register for Senate races (late in the fall if I remember correctly). So there doesn't seem to be a rush from that standpoint. \n* raising the prominence of a given issue (e.g. Inslee with climate change) - not qualifying for a debate significantly reduces ones chances of doing this so this may provide impetus for candidates to drop out Therefore I am shifting the distribution up. Still \"five or more\" would be very surprising given the historical record. Forecasters whom I respect such as @Anneinak and @MaRott are allocating a high chance for five or more to drop out. I wonder if that is purely based on qualification for the 3rd debate?

By the fifth debate, only a total of 3 candidates dropped out.  By the Iowa primary, there were still 12 candidates (a total of 5 dropped out by that time).  The drop-out rate was not high after each debate.   However, the Republican debates were divided into two tiers using poll data.  While the second-tier candidates were not invited to the first-tier debates, they still have debate and coverage exposure, albeit much less, in the second-tier debates.   The situation is different in this Democratic primary and debates.  For the third Democratic debate, the number of participants will be cut down significantly.  To be invited, a candidate has to have more than 130,000 donors and have at least 2% polling in 4 qualified polls.  As of today, there are 8 candidates that have past these thresholds [2].   Two candidates have the number of donors but need another poll to qualify.  Three more candidates have some potential, albeit small, to get there.  The rest (11) candidates are not even close to qualifying.  It seems clear that at least half of the candidates will not qualify to the debates, and therefore it will be only one debate with about 10 people \u2013 there is no second tier debate like the 2016 Republican debates.  Without exposure from debates, there is no way that these candidates can survive.  Will they drop out before this third debate?  They may not for a while.  However, the answer to the forecast is easier because the choices are 0, 1-2, 3-4 and 5 or more.  It would be much harder if there are more choices at numbers greater than 5.  But it is what it is.  I am going all the way in forecasting 100% for five or more candidates to drop out.

I feel there\u2019s a fair likelihood that at least one or two others who miss the next debate (likely 8-10 of those in the second debate) will also drop out, possibly just before the next debate once the time to qualify passed, while the rest stubbornly stay in or give the news that they\u2019re dropping out during or immediately after the third debates to minimize the media attention on their dropout. I think there\u2019s an equal chance of many more dropping out or none at all.
