Interestingly, the number of new deaths peaked only once, on 31 July 2020 (1,595), followed by a smaller high on 07 August 2020 (1,437).\n/This indicates there is a loose correlation with a time lag for Brazil of maybe 7 to 8 days. After changing to the 3rd bin yesterday, I now decided to roll back partially, because of one thing that has caught my attention in the graph: after a declining trend in new cases for most of August 2020 (consecutive highs are always lower than the previous one), for the first time in two weeks the weekly high rose again and on 06 September 2020 surpassed 51k new cases again.\nI predict a change in general trend of new cases there, and predict it will be associated with a change in trend of new deaths around 14 September 2020, after which, I assume, the weekly lows (e.g. 366 deaths on 01 September 2020) will lie at 850 or higher for the remaining two weeks. The death toll of 5 of the 7 weekdays should then be no lower than 1,200. The last two days of the question, Wednesday 30 September 2020 and Thursday 01 October 2020, are weekdays that use to turn out strong after the weekly lows that use to be on Mondays and Tuesdays.\nI can imagine that the last two days will bring values of 1,400 each. All put together, the sum of new deaths in my projection between 14 September and 01 October 2020 could be 18,200 fatalities. Combined with the 126,203 as of 07 Sept 2020, the total excluding the period 08 September through 13 September 2020 would be 144,400 fatalities.\nTo me, it will all come down to how fast any rise in new cases will feed into the number of new fatalities, and whether the six days between today Tuesday (low number expected) 08 September and Sunday (possibly a lower number, too) 13 September 2020 will turn out with a sum of 6,000 or more fatalities (1,000 per day on average).

As in many other places, the weekly number of deaths has been following a clearly discernible exponential (in this case decreasing) pattern: DeathBR (day_n) - DeathBR (day_n-7) = x  (DeathBR (day_n-7) - DeathBR (day_n-14) )  for the last 21 days, the mean and variance of x has been: x = 0.980 +/- 0.033 which, curiously, is not enough to distinguish in a statistical significant way whether the deaths are simply growing linearly or whether they are showing a soft exponential decrease. Now, to end below the 150K bucket, we need x < 0.987, which is like 0.25 sigmas below the central value. From this, it is about a 58% probability to end up below 150K, but I remove a bit of probability just in case there is a big revision of the data, maybe going up (more probably) or down (that could also happen). Yet this revision does not need to move things from one bucket to another. Now, of course there is a fly in the ointment here: the error I have provided for x is for the change of one week to the next. The correct way to calculate the probability will be to notice that there are five weeks, and thus we are throwing the dice of \"how many cases we will have next week\" five times. This indicates that the real variance over five weeks is 1/sqrt(5) the one I gave, which will sharpen the probabilities of being below 150K to 68% (instead of 58%). However I have decided to err on the \"overestimate my own errors\" side. EDIT: the last comment is only correct if I want to calculate the expected weekly deaths in five weeks time. But we are summing, and thus error compound in a more complicated manner (the error of the first week will be sigma, for the second week sigma / sqrt(2), for the third, sigma / sqrt(3), etc., then the error of their sum would be sigma * sqrt(1 + 1/4 + 1/9 + 1/16 + 1/25) = 1.21 sigma, which actually it is extremely close to sigma and this is probably why this approach has been somehow useful in the past, despite being so crude."], [93502, "2020-08-23T12:02:47Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.33, 0.67, 0.0], "As of today, Aug 22nd, Brazil has 113,358 deaths.\nThe daily average of the last 7 days is 976 deaths per day (weekends tend to report less deaths, so the averaging must be made on a weekly basis - or multiples of a week).\nWith 9 days remaining in August and 30 days in September, the projected deaths total by end of September is 151.422.\nStill a close call, but it seems that the 150k will likely be crossed, the 1.422 extra projected is equivalent of almost two days\u2019 worth of casualties, therefore a significant \u2018buffer\u2019.

Last 7 days had an average of 987 deaths per day. The week before looks about the same. So, if we take the bookends approach:\n- To reach to 120k deaths it needs to be average of only 370 deaths per day until end of Sept. Too low, which means the 120k threshhold is bound to be crossed (assuming reporting continues and is not politically manipulated, I will choose to ignore any political manipulation of numbers).\n- With a low average of 600 deaths per day for the next 54 days, we get to ~133k deaths by end of Sept.\n- With a high average of 1000 deaths per day for the next 54 days, we get to ~155k deaths by end of Sept.\n- I expect today's average of 987 to drop in September, assuming the country gets over the peak. But, between 600 and 1,000 average deaths, it will be closer to the high, maybe 800-900.\n- The 150k threshold is crossed when average is ~925 deaths per day.\n- So, between the 120-150k and the 150-180k bracket, I am leaning somewhat more towards the lower.\n- If it is a normal distribution, with a mean of 800 deaths per day, and a P90 of 1000 deaths/day, then the 925 deaths per day sits at  cumulative probability of 56%. I round up to 60% because I believe in it slowing down, more than I believe in maintaining a plateau of 800 or increasing, so I believe my normal distribution should be skewed to the lower end of it.

I\u00b4d like to add something to the equation, which leads me away from the crowd and especially from the more experienced people here.\nSimple idea: if the setting is relatively under control (most important: concerning numbers of tests), it makes sense to look at other numbers: ratio of active cases vs. recovered; critical cases; cases/1 M population; most important for this question: deaths/1 M population. Believe it or not: Brazil does not look so bad with those numbers. In other words: to go from 88K to 150K in 2 months (after having analyzed many other countries) they would need to be much worse.

On one hand the population is younger than in developed countries (an advantage) and on the other a very high proportion of poor and extremely poor people make up the general population, affecting health and access to healthcare. There's the risk of Bolsorano attempting (again) to suppress coronavirus data, making it difficult for the WHO to publish accurate results. Another risk is the WHO ceasing to publish Brazil data in the event of Brazil withdrawing from the WHO (which Bolsorano has threatened previously). He seems to have threatened this on the back of the US announcement to withdraw themselves, but considering Trump's dwindling poll numbers and the court and public backlash at home that forced Bolsorano to restart Covid data publication, he may take a step back to wait and see how Trump's handling of the virus plays out in the US election in early November.

Every week there are about 7000 new deaths. It is difficult to say whether this is due to misreporting or because the pandemic is not in its explosive phase anymore. During May one could observe a stay increase in the numbers of deaths. Now, if this trend continues, we should end up with 150K deaths by the deadline. Just between the two buckets. If this trend is reversed and somehow Brazil bends the curve, we will below this number. Besides, the new Dexamethasone treatment could reduce the number of deaths, somewhere between 20-30% for people with respiratory complications, which could decrease the weekly deaths into the 4000-5500 range in a best case scenario. This indicates that we might need to err on the low side, instead of the high side as usual. The first thing is to determine the minimum number of deaths that we can expect: if the new cases curve somehow bended today, we will still have at least two more weeks of a linear regime before seeing a bending of deaths. This puts us into the 70K deaths minimum. Now, if somehow the deaths begin to reduce by a factor of 0.8-0.9 per week (somehow in the range of the reduction in Italy (0.75) or the US (0.88) for weekly deaths), this will add to about 98-133K deaths. This would be the floor. Besides this, from time to time there are revisions on the numbers of deaths. This could happen in Brazil, and most probably would be a revision upwards. If this is the case, the higher buckets will become more probable. Yet this is too optimistic: the inflection point is probably going to come later. But for the moment let us assume that this happens and that we take the value in the middle: 116K deaths. This excludes the first bucket and makes the second bucket improbable.

If that were to hold, the projection (using a 2% growth rate) would be around 365k, deaths by October. 90k would be reached by July 21st, and 180k by Aug 25th. This seems to be the \"do nothing\" result, which Bolsonaro isn't quite doing, but he also sure isn't projecting a clear message [2]. This may leave the local authorities to do much of the work of keeping things in check, much like has happened in the US -- which has resulted in a patchwork of rules and outbreaks. The US growth rate of deaths for the past few weeks has been closer to 0.5 -1% [3]. The highest reached when NY was at its worst, was around 7-10% increase. With that in mind, I'd predict 2% for the next couple weeks, probably a higher spike to 10% for a week, then a drop to 1% for a month, then 0.5% for the duration. That puts the total at 200k.
