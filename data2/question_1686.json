There are around 300 players going to the \"bubble.\" (24 teams, about 12 players per team). So, 22 or more cases suggests a pretty large outbreak - about 2 teams worth of players. I think the season will be called off before it reaches that level. So, I'm going go with the crowd essentially, but under on the 22 or more just because it seems almost impossible that more than 22 players get it without the season being called off previously.  I think some clarification regarding the term \"end of the season\" would be nice. If they put the season on pause, and then later cancel it, would positive cases in between the pause and the cancellation count?

If a suspension period does not, that could present an extremely long testing window. (Assuming that for at least some meaningful period of a suspension, players would choose/be compelled to remain \"residing\" in the bubble.) I have requested a clarification from admins on this question. For now, I am assuming that only an official \"season is over\" announcement will count.\n-How many positives before they shut it down? (I'm assuming that they will pause games with even one or a few cases, but wouldn't cancel without a broader cluster.  That said, during such a pause, many more cases would likely be discovered.) To the extent that 16 players have tested positive in recent days, and NBA is forging ahead, I assume that level of positive tests falls within NBA's \"expected\" realm for any given point in time.  If that is the case, the total number of positives over a period of time could be substantially higher without prompting them to pull the plug on the season. I appreciate @ikresnak's comment here:  \"MLS had a similar testing protocol and 10 players tested positive on single team. Basketball courts are 1) indoors, 2) smaller, and 3) the game requires much more physical contact.\" Thanks to @Bobbiekar52 for tip on the most helpful article I read on this. [1] Excerpt: \"The occurrence of a small or otherwise expected number of COVID-19 cases will not require a decision to suspend or cancel the resumption of the 2019-20 season.\"  Big picture, I think the specific framing of this question sets up a high likelihood of an extended window between the first positives and the official \"end\", skewing the probability very heavily toward the high side.
