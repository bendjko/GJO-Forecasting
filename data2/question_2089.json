This assumes then that the Fed will first have to signal its intent to taper before it begins to signal its intent to raise rates.  With a tapering announcement likely at some point in the fourth quarter (likely at the November or December FOMC meeting), the probability of an announced increase in the target  funds rate prior to the December FOMC meeting is exceedingly low.   An announced increase in the target funds rate by the December FOMC meeting would only likely occur if the economy continues to overshoot the Fed's estimates and inflation significantly exceeds the Fed target rate (2% PCE deflator).   An announced lowering of the target funds rate would only occur if there were a sudden exogenous shock (e.g., large scale terror attack; vaccine resistant variant of the COVID-19; financial crisis; geopolitical conflict) that caused a massive economic/financial market dislocation. I would estimate that the probability that the Fed raises the target range for the funds rate would be about five times more likely than the Fed reducing its target range for the funds rate (which would imply negative rates).

Thus, in spite of lots of 'talk' of tapering, IMO there's little probability of an increase in the FED target rate. Even if the FED should, as forward guidance, advise that tapering will begin in Q4/21 or Q1/22, that is still, relatively speaking, very accommodative and unlikely to affect the reserve target rate within the time frames of this question. Additionally, the apparent slowdown in China and the fear of growing Delta variant Covid cases is likely to keep a cap on economic activity in the next 3-5 months.
