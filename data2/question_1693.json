Will it stay there?   The momentum of the Dow Oil Index is flat.   However, Chevron is supposed to be in much better financial shape than its competitors.    The stock rose on heavy volume, which I suspect indicates that a significant portion of those who watch and invest in this stock think there has been a fundamental change in value as a result of the merger.   I read the articles cited by @jayce and  @Censusguyz.   The Forbes article cited by Jayce lists comments on the purchase by four analysts, which were all positive and so was the CNBC article.  This supports my hunch that the high trading volume and increase in price was the result of a change in Chevron's  fundamental valuation.  The CNBC article said that Chevron is using its superior financial condition during the downturn to purchase \"high quality assets\" such as Noble Energy.   The article cited Noble Energy's access to the Leviathan natural gas field, which is the largest in the eastern Mediterranean and only came online last year.   Noble Energy was said to have a better than average free cash flow in the article.  The annual 2019 annual report also boasted of its free cash flow, yet I could not understand the report.   Noble Energy has lost a lot of money in the last few years, and I could not figure out how a company could lose money and have a large free cash flow at the same time. In any event, I am sure Chevron examined the financial records of Noble carefully and would have figured it out if the free cash flow was a myth.    Also, the CNBC article quoted a energy industry analyst.  I read that industry specific analysts are supposed to have much better track records than analysts who deal with companies in multiple sectors or all sectors.  All in all, I suspect Chevron as stated by @jayce is a stong buy.      https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblackmon/2020/07/20/chevrons-deal-to-buy-noble-energy-attracts-positive-analyst-reviews/#4bd4c5852459\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/20/chevron-to-buy-noble-energy-in-a-5-billion-deal.html"], [90167, "2020-07-21T19:55:38Z", [0.0, 0.16, 0.68, 0.16, 0.0], ""], [22689, "2020-07-21T18:58:43Z", [0.05, 0.5, 0.45, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [14027, "2020-07-21T18:49:19Z", [0.0, 0.13, 0.43, 0.43, 0.01], ""], [88010, "2020-07-21T18:44:51Z", [0.0, 0.09, 0.65, 0.25, 0.01], ""], [13306, "2020-07-21T17:49:18Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.3, 0.45, 0.1], ""], [84880, "2020-07-21T16:53:46Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.69, 0.15, 0.01], "I should've updated this sooner.
