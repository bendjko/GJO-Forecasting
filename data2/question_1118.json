End of Day Market CAP, April 26,2019: Microsoft: $995.323B\nApple: $963.332B\nAmazon: $960.357B\nAlphabet: $886.093B The forecast at hand assigns the highest probability to Microsoft being the first company, crossing the trillion-dollar threshold, determined by the end-of-day Market Cap reported by Bloomberg. This is due to the fact that Microsoft been the only one of the former mentioned companies so far, crossing the threshold in 2019, namely on April 25 ($130,51 per share). However, even if it passed the threshold throughout the day, by the end of the day it went down again, thus closing only at $129.15 per share and missing the trillion dollar threshold (https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/MSFT.O/key-developments). One day later, on April 26, closing value kept raising to $129,89 per share to a a 995.323 billion dollar value (https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MSFT:US). With only, little missing to to cross the significant trillion dollar threshold. A further growth can be expected due to the great revenue numbers, in all its business segments, which should promote further stock buying.  (https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/25/18515623/microsoft-worth-1-trillion-dollars-stock-price-value). From my limited point of expertise, the forecast at hand sees Microsoft\u2019s great advantage, particularly over Apple in its growing cloud service, as well as its office products and linkedin that are less in danger of a general market over-saturation than for instance Apple\u2019s hardware products and still have significant growing capacities. However, even in the hardware  sector Microsoft is strong due to its Windows, Xbox and Surface products. Amazon closed on April 26,2019 as third after Microsoft and Apple with an End of Day Market CAP of $960.357B. However, the forecast at hand, estimates the company to be the second most likely to pass the one trillion dollar threshold. The reason therefore is the expected iPhone release   in September (see below), which is rather late given the time frame of the question at hand. Furthermore, unlike Apple Amazon is less at risk of a market over-saturation. Particularly Amazon\u2019s North America business keeps growing and is at an all-time high, aligned with booming sales in its growing ad division and a highly profitable cloud computing business (https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/4/17819160/amazon-worth-1-trillion-dollars-stock-price-value). The forecast at hand assumes a another advantage in terms of growing chances in its rather (in relative terms) weak performance outside of North America, which leaves great growing opportunities for Amazon.  Apple closed on April 26, 2019 as second after Microsoft as of $963,332B. In order to estimate its chances to hit the $1 trillion threshold first, another forecast is within this forecast is needed, namely the release date of its 2019 iphone. This is due to the fact that until today iPhone sales make up nearly 60% of Apple\u2019s entire revenue (https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/26/18109784/microsoft-apple-market-cap-2018-valuable-company). Hence, the success of the new iPhone release will heavily determine its End of Day Market Cap. So far, Apple have always announced and presented its new iPhone in September (https://www.imore.com/iphone-2019), which is why the forecast at hand expects its to do the same this year. However, this means that this will happen at the end of the time period of the question at hand, making it realistic that both Microsoft and Amazon will bypass the threshold sooner (see former arguments). On top of that, the forecast at hand attests Apple and its iphones to be vulnerable to market over-saturation, as well as strong and growing competing through Google in this segment (https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/27/technology/27apple.html). Alphabet closed as least valuable company on April 26, 2019 as of$886.093B and unlike the other three companies never got close to the one trillion dollar threshold and also the developments of both end-of-day Market Cap data in 2019, as well as in the last two years do not speak in favor of Alphabet being the first one passing the one trillion dollar threshold. Based upon this analysis (based upon a limited expertise), the forecast at hand estimates a likelihood of 60% that Mircrosoft will be the first one to pass the one trillion dollar threshold, followed by Amazon with a 20% likelihood, Apple with a 10% likelihood and Alphabet and non of them with a 5% likelihood, respectively.

My fear is leaving out too many data or focusing too much on some of them, chosen randomly. Such a procedure would be incomplete and erroneous. I don\u2019t want to work too much with number if I\u2019m not enough confident on them, because there is the risk of simplifying the calculation, overlooking information, and reaching an inconsistent outcome, very hard to consider as valuable. \nSo, I will start my analysis using numbers but just to have an overview of the current and recent situation of the companies, then I will focus on some more discursive argumentations.\nHowever, I\u2019ll show how the differences between the companies are sometimes very subtle and is difficult to make predictions. 26/04/2019: rankings of market cap (MK) and growth rate (GR) from 1st Jan 2019 to 24th April 2019 ( calculations: MK=(t1-t0)/t0 )\nApple\nMK 967.953B, GR 31,33% 967.817B\nMicrosoft\nMK 989.653B, GR 20,74% (MK increased a lot compared to yesterday, when it was lower than AppleMK)\nAmazon\nMK 936.009B, GR 24,70%\nAlphabet\nMK 879.588B, GR 20,00% Alphabet: it has never reached the $1trillion market cap, and the graphic show a lot of up and downs, both considering the more recent period (from 1 Jan 2019) and the last two years, 2018 and 2019. Currently, it has the lowest market cap among the four companies and its discontinuous rate of growth make me assess its probability of reaching the aim of $1T to 0%. Microsoft: It has a growth rate not so different from Amazon and a market cap higher that Alphabet. It never reached the $1T either in the past, but after a negative period in the end of 2018 (in which all the 4 companies passed through), its growth happened to be higher than usual.\nSome years ago Microsoft has lost the smartphone software market to Apple and Google, which let him behind in the race, but Microsoft has reached other solutions, like the cloud business.\nEven if it\u2019s behind in the foundational parts of the cloud computing basis (selling access to raw computing power and data storage), Microsoft also has a significant cloud applications business, in the shape of the online service Office 365 and business applications such as customer relationship management. The cloud is strongly contributing to the company\u2019s growth. This business can help in cementing its position on the market. Microsoft also has a significant cloud applications business, in the shape of the online service Office 365 and business applications such as customer relationship management. \nMoreover, yesterday Microsoft happened to push its valuation across $1tn before pulling back slightly (so, not a end-of-day market cap), which is a good signal for the growth of the company and for its investors. Indeed, the market cap formula is MK=total numbers of shares*price of shares, where the price of the shares could be overestimated or underestimated, if compared to their real value, because it reflects the market price and how much the investors are available to spend on them. So, the general enthusiasm for the Microsoft success can increase investors\u2019 interests. \nIn the end, Microsoft is a real challenger because its cloud services product is second only to Amazon, it has invested in growth on LinkedIn and GitHUb and it\u2019s considered the safest between these four big market capitalization companies. Amazon: It has been the second company to reach the 1tn goal last year. In these days it is announcing that it will close its online store in China that allows the country\u2019s consumers to buy from Chinese merchants after facing difficulties in competing with the domestic Alibaba and JD.com, extremely aggressive and competitive. However, the \u201cMad Money\u201d host favoured Amazon in the race to 1tn. its stock still ended 2018 up 28 percent and it\u2019s \u201cseeing earnings growth after years of earnings losses coupled with revenue expansion, a common model for growing tech companies.\u201d Moreover, Amazon can count on three main business, the cloud-based Amazon Web Services, the advertising business and the consumer-facing retail segment, which look to be performing strongly. Apple: in 2018 it has been the first company to reach the $1trillion market cap. \nHowever, it can\u2019t be excluded that its race is going to decrease. Indeed, even if it\u2019s a big market cap enterprise, which usually make its value higher and the investors are motivated on buying its shares because they guarantee long-term profits and low risk rate, it can take quite a hard hit. \nThe reason is that there may never be another product as profitable as the iPhone. The iPhone makes up more than 60 per cent of Apple\u2019s revenues. But in the end of 2018 some leaks from Chinese electronics manufacturers or cautious comments from Apple\u2019s suppliers in their own earnings calls out doubts over the iPhone\u2019s performance. Apple\u2019s value on the market started to fall. Moreover, the company second largest source of incomes is the \u201cServices\u201d business: not iPad, Mac or other devices but something closely related to iPhone. Therefore, if the values of iPhones are going to fall, so will do the current growth of the services. Also, iPhones latest new models don\u2019t show very innovative changes compared to the previous ones, and currently exists a general trend in preferring cheaper smartphone: people seem less available to spend a big amount of money on phones. Apple slowdown in iPhone sales (not only in China) could represent a boost to the Chinese market and pull away from the 1tn goal.\nHowever, it remains the society with the current highest growth rate and, usually, the highest market cap (not today). https://www.ft.com/content/b5f66f16-5f61-11e8-9334-2218e7146b04\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/cd023464-675e-11e9-9adc-98bf1d35a056\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/1ffe020c-6191-11e9-b285-3acd5d43599e\nhttps://www.ig.com/it/glossario-trading/definizione-di-capitalizzazione-di-mercato\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/320d606c-5c3a-11e8-9334-2218e7146b04\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/10/cramer-tracks-race-back-to-1-trillion-amazon-leads-apple-lags.html "], [67430, "2019-04-26T11:42:06Z", [0.0, 0.25, 0.2, 0.55, 0.0], "Today, 26th April, the market capitalization of the 4 companies is as follows: - Alphabet: $879,588 billion\n- Amazon: $936,009 billion\n- Apple: $967,953 billion\n- Microsoft: $989, 653 billion I personally don't think that calculating the date by accounting for the past growth rate is a good system, as shown by Microsoft's growth in the past few weeks. I rather prefer to look at what is expected by the companies in the future. Alphabet is very far behind, and nothing happening in the near future seems to indicate that it will rise to the point to first hit the target. Apple became the first US company to hit the mark, last August, but its current market cap is just the second best. Last January, Apple reported revenue of $84.3 billion, a decline of 5 percent from one year ago, mainly caused by revenue from iPhone declining 15 percent from the prior year. Apple is scheduled to report earnings on April 30, and the company is expected to provide more information about new services offerings focused on gaming, videos, and news, as well as an update on its capital-allocation program. That will probably be a decisive date. (https://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-stock-bounces-back-toward-1-trillion-market-cap-2019-04-09).  Amazon briefly joined Apple a month later but now has a value of \"only\" $936 billion. The company is in a very solid position, with its  growth being driven by the loyalty of its prime customers, who pay an annual fee in return for \u201cfree\u201d shipping on all purchases. Even with the huge number of prime members, there\u2019s further potential for expansion. (https://www.investingdaily.com/43704/our-amazon-stock-prediction-in-2019-buy-or-sell/). There is no good reason to exclude that Amazon hits the target again, but whether it can do so before Microsoft is the real issue. Microsoft crossed the barrier for its first time during last Wednesday trading, when shares jumped more than 4% on better-than-expected earnings and revenue.

Microsoft is experiencing increasing success in their cloud storage products and have seen significant growth in users in this particular area. \nDue to Apple\u2019s high growth rate and the fact that they have previously reached the 1 trillion market capitalization, I deem it most likely that they will be the first to company to reach this mark in 2019. \n"], [62087, "2019-04-19T04:08:01Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.5, 0.4, 0.0], ""], [63817, "2019-04-18T22:48:01Z", [0.25, 0.55, 0.15, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [57797, "2019-04-18T21:10:07Z", [0.0, 0.2, 0.44, 0.34, 0.02], ""], [38, "2019-04-18T16:43:49Z", [0.0, 0.11, 0.33, 0.56, 0.0], "according to Bloomberg MS's  growth rate is nearly double Apple's.

We will travel space with a mirror type sail. Pushed by our own suns rays. We will learn about gravataional wavez and what they do to the human body and mind. These radio waves effect how humans interact with each other. By knowing this. We can control depression easier. There will also be no such thing as blind anymore. Dr will be able to grow organs in a ptree dish and full function brain. We will have prostetics made cheaper and more realistic to touch and feel. Computers and organism will be come one. Human and computer. We will come to a point in human history where we will have to choose which direction the rest of humanity lays. Either AI will have regulations and not be allowed to control hurt or up a human being. There must be extreme thought in this as it will determine if human kind still exist. We could choose the last route and that seems to be the norm so eventually and people find this statement crazy and it would never happen. Its already happening.

Indeed, the company has already reached it, and it has little percentage of evolution to achieve to reach the level. In addition, between the last quarter of 2018 and the first 2019, they had the highest growth percentage, at 24.4%. However, the big drop recorded between the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2018 largely destabilized Apple, where the average market cap of 2018 was in decline. Apple seems most likely but nothing is assured, especially against Amazon.\n- Amazon between the last quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 has a growth rate almost similar to Apple. Moreover, it needs little percentage of evolution to reach the 1T, only 2% more than Apple. Especially, Amazon has very well out of the recession period of the last quarter of 2018, much more than Apple. If we take this period off, Amazon has a much stronger growth in 2018 than all the others. In addition, Amazon has already reached 1T.\n- Microsoft also seems very well placed to reach the 1T, even if the probabilities are lower, especially because of its correct growth but not explosive in 2018 (although the company has shown resilience to the recession of the last quarter of 2018), its average market cap for 2018 was the third. Microsoft is second in the market cap of April 5, but its growth between the last quarter of 2018 and the first of 2019 is lower than Apple and Amazon.\n- However, it should be noted that the first three are very close in the race and therefore a specific event (announcement of a product, scandal) could tip the victory in this race for one of the companies.\n- Finally, it seems than for 2019, the 1T level will be a normal gap for market cap.\n- Nevertheless, in the case of an specific event, and a new period of recession, it is possible that none of the above can reach the 1T level before the end of October.

It does not feign the ability to understand or project future market fluctuations.  As of today (7/4) market capitalisation of the four companies in question stand at: Alphabet: 840.58\nAmazon: 902.48\nApple: 928.91\nMicrosoft:  919.82 To project which of these will reach a market capitalisation of 1trillion first, the growth rates of each will be calculated. For each month, growth rates were calculated using the formula: (period 1 - period 0)/ period 0 = growth rate for that month. For each time period, average monthly growth rates were calculated. Next to monthly growth rates are the projected number of months it will take to reach 1 trillion based on that rate, using April 1 end-of-day market capitalisation. Using the formula, we are solving for n: 1T= Market Cap x (1+R)^n, where R is growth rate. Monthly growth rates in the last 35 months:\nAlphabet: 1.611% \u2014> 6.64 months\nAmazon: 3.228% \u2014> 3.07 months\nApple: 2.09% \u2014> 4.41 months\nMicrosoft: 2.686% \u2014> 3 months Monthly growth rates in the last 24 months:\nAlphabet: 1.654% \u2014> 6.46 months\nAmazon: 3.416% \u2014> 2.9 months\nApple: 1.621% \u2014> 5.67 months\nMicrosoft: 2.718% \u2014> 2.93 months Monthly growth rates in the last 12 months:\nAlphabet: 1.557% \u2014> 6.86 months\nAmazon: 2.648% \u2014> 3.73 months\nApple: 1.541% \u2014> 5.96 months\nMicrosoft: 2.795% \u2014> 2.85 months Monthly growth rates in the last 6 months:\nAlphabet: 0.043% \u2014> 246.6 months\nAmazon: -1.112% \u2014> experience negative growth rates, excluded\nApple: -2.022% \u2014> experience negative growth rates, excluded\nMicrosoft: 0.914% \u2014> 8.62 months Monthly growth rates in the last 3 months:\nAlphabet: 4.376% \u2014> 2.48 months\nAmazon: 5.66%% \u2014> 1.77 months\nApple: 6.756% \u2014> 1.39 months\nMicrosoft: 5.789% \u2014> 1.39 months Thus, based on April 1 market capitalisation:\nAlphabet: when using 4 of the 5 growth rates computed, Alphabet is projected to reach 1T last. It also has the lowest market capitalisation today. With a (comparatively) 'bad' starting position and respectively lower growth rates, it is considered highly unlikely to be first to 1T (1%). Amazon: If we look to long-term growth rates (35 and 24 months), it would be reasonable to assume Amazon would come in first or a close second to reaching 1T before October 31. However, the behaviour of the market in the last 6 months radically changes this. More recent growth rates suggest Amazon will be defeated by Apple and Microsoft. Since 1T is impending, and all companies are relatively close, greater emphasis is placed on the last three months. Based on three month projections, Amazon will reach 1T in 1 month and 24 days (from April 1) \u2014 just 12 days after Microsoft and Apple. This is close. While expected to come third, Amazon has an advantage over, say Microsoft, in that it has met the 1T before. This is considered in this forecast, and bolsters the forecast slightly. It is forecasted to be beat out by two other companies, but its history suggests it could make a rapid come back. Thus it is given 14%.  Microsoft & Apple: Using each of the growth rates, excluding one, Microsoft comes out on top (in one instance equal with Apple, using 3 month growth rates). Based on this information alone, one might expect Microsoft to be first to 1T. However, Microsoft is winning in the long run because it did not experience as great a dip in the second half of last year \u2014 which has has the affect of reducing calculated growth rates, for apple especially, across the board. Again, given the time frame we are looking at, it is more relevant to look to the last three months\u2019 growth rates. This would put both Microsoft and Apple at reaching 1T on the same day, one month and 12 days from April 1. This is based on April 1 values, remember, where Microsoft was in a stronger position (924.55 billion compared to Apple\u2019s 912.84). But, the previous calculations have been based on April 1 and incorporated growth rates up and until this date. If we look to what\u2019s occurred on the market between April 1 and the closing market cap. on Friday, Apple was the only company to experience a growth. Today, it is at 928.91 billion compared to Microsoft\u2019s 919.82. Given Apple\u2019s strong position in the last three months, and it\u2019s capacity to recover from last year\u2019s downfall (and still retain relatively high growth rates in the long term), it appears to be in the best position to reach 1T. Considering Microsoft\u2019s consistency, they are in a strong position but, based on historical data, will be pipped by Apple. Apple is given 55% while Microsoft is given 30%. Considering other factors:\nIn the last three years, June has not been a good month for any of the tech companies. Thus, growth rates may be expected to fall off when June hits. Meaning that if one of the companies does not reach the 1T mark before June, the forecast \u2014 which placed emphasis on the past three months\u2019 growth rates \u2014 may be off."], [13377, "2019-04-07T09:43:56Z", [0.08, 0.2, 0.07, 0.07, 0.58], ""], [14027, "2019-04-06T23:42:30Z", [0.01, 0.17, 0.31, 0.29, 0.22], "From the April 5 closing prices the required increases for each of the four to reach $1T (according to Bloomberg.com) are as follows: Apple -- 7.7%\nMicrosoft -- 8.7%\nAmazon -- 10.8%\nAlphabet -- 18.2% For NOTA to be correct none of the four can increase to $1T.

Given this little disclaimer, here is what I believe after some research: According to the trends provided by Bloomberg, Apple and Amazon already reached 1 trillion in 2018. However, then both titles have dropped quite a lot.  Today\u2019s (April 5) market capitalization of these brands is: \n-Apple: 927.496\n-Microsoft: 920.129\n-Amazon: 893.429\n-Alphabet: 841.817 Looking at these numbers, we can already establish who is closet to 1 trillion, Both Microsoft and Apple are not that far, with Apple slightly bigger but more or less both need around a 8-9% increase to reach 1 trillion. Then there is Amazon and finally Alphabet.  That said, looking at the one-year growth rate on the same website, we can see that after the dramatic drop in January, both Amazon and Apple started a sharp growth (albeit some up and down). Microsoft suffered a smaller drop in January and, although being still behind apple and amazon, the brand is growing at an incredible rate and seems unstoppable. Alphabet, which driving force is Google, is also growing quickly after a negative period at the end of the last year. However, this brand looks more prone to ups and downs than the others.  Concluding, it is very difficult to assess who will win this race or whether it will be won by someone in the first place. Many factors play a role and predicting the unpredictable market is very hard, especially for a non-expert like me For this reason, I will not assess too different probabilities to the 4 possible outcomes. while I consider more unlikely the option \"none of the above\". That said, I assess that Apple has the biggest chance because generally when they announce new products, they notice a boom in the market. Considering that October is in 6 months only and that in this period normally new Apple stuff (the new I-phone for sure) comes out, I have reason to believe they have the major chance to reach 1 trillion again.

Given the fact that any kind of market study, estimation over the actions' value, and analysis over the growth of a comany would be not only terribly wrong, but also offensive in regards to the experts and students of the subject, I have to try to do this forecast anyway, hoping that Tetlock's right and non experts tend to do better forecasts rather than experts. The only indicator I could possibly express my opinion about in this regard is the potential of a company from now to the end of october. To understand this, I made a naive research about these companies' new products, and I tried to immagine their impact on their actual end-of-day market capitalization. First of all, I had to understand what alphabet is - as already stated, my ignorance in the matter is deep, but if even for you it's the first time hearing about alphabet, here's some help (https://www.lifewire.com/understanding-google-and-alphabet-4116085). Alphabet seems indeed a promising enterprise, Cramer is absolutely crazy about it, and recently they announced \"Backstory, a cybersecurity product designed to help companies figure out how to protect themselves from hackers.\" (https://www.businessinsider.com/alphabet-chronicle-backstory-splunk-2019-3?r=US&IR=T&IR=T). Then we have Amazon, which, together with Apple, already hit the trillion, and whose program in innovation is pretty outstanding (https://www.aboutamazon.com/innovation). Apple seems on the verge to annouce some new products, such as the new MacBook Pro, a MacBook Air, a new IPad and IPhone XI (https://www.techradar.com/news/the-big-three-in-2019-apple-google-and-microsofts-upcoming-hardware-year). If I understood things correctly, Google's performace can help Alphabet, and a new Google assistant system seems to be on the way (https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/10/18175524/google-assistant-devices-ces-2019-tvs-soundbars-smart-speakers-kitchen-bathroom-cars). Finally, Microsoft may release the new Surface Book 3, maybe a new XBox, the Surface Pro 7 and Surface Phone. \nThat said, the forecast is just about what I think is going to have more effect on the market. Right now Microsoft is leading, followed by Apple, Amazon and Alphabet. Nevertheless, I think it's still not Alphabet's time to beat Apple and Amazon. Moreover, I think Apple's and Amazon's innovations can have a stronger impact - and consider that new products can be ordered and delivered by Amazon itself, through its new innovative delivery and packaging systems. Hence, if one of the companies will reach the trillion, I think it will be Amazon, even though Apple stands absolutely a chance. That said, I think the most likely outcome will be that none of the companies will reach the trillion by the end of october. I don't even know how to explain it, I will just say that every company is more than 100 billions away from the trillion, and I don't think they'll be able to reach that result before november."], [1333, "2019-03-28T20:29:19Z", [0.1, 0.14, 0.15, 0.11, 0.5], ""], [41922, "2019-03-28T09:57:50Z", [0.0, 0.08, 0.16, 0.16, 0.6], ""], [1333, "2019-03-27T18:31:56Z", [0.1, 0.15, 0.15, 0.11, 0.49], ""], [42298, "2019-03-26T16:50:47Z", [0.11, 0.12, 0.18, 0.19, 0.4], ""], [1333, "2019-03-26T16:03:11Z", [0.12, 0.15, 0.15, 0.11, 0.47], ""], [1333, "2019-03-26T15:55:44Z", [0.12, 0.15, 0.15, 0.12, 0.46], "Over the next 25 years, 87% of voters believe Facebook will have to deal with significant competition that will challenge its dominance.

Voters also overwhelmingly believe that Google, Amazon, and Apple will face significant competition over the coming quarter of a century. However, most believe those companies will survive. Just 26% believe Apple will go out of business, 23% say the same about Google, and 20% think Amazon will disappear. Other survey data shows that 55% of voters believe Facebook has too much power today. However, just 21% believe the federal government should impose regulations on social media companies to ensure equal opportunities for all points of view. The reluctance to embrace a political solution may stem partly from the belief that companies like Facebook will face significant competition.
