Deaths for the week ending June 5 = cases for the week ending May 15 * 7-day average case fatality rate (CFR) on June 5. On the JHU webpage today for cases in the past week, ending May 15: 237,017. This will likely be revised slightly upward, to perhaps about 240k. \nThen the 7-day average of cases/day on May 15 = 237k/7 to 240k/7 = 33.9k to 34.3k. 7-day CFR on June 5 = 7-day average of deaths/day on June 5 / 7-day average of cases/day on May 15. The 7-day CFR has been declining since vaccination started, but the pace of the decline has slowed recently. The 7-day CFR may now have plateaued around 1.00% +/- fluctuations as large as 0.05%. It's possible that it may continue to decline further, but clearly at a pace slower than its previous 0.1%/10 days, as vaccination rates have slowed. It could also start to increase a bit as many people stop wearing masks indoors, thereby increasing the exposure of vulnerable people, both vaccinated and unvaccinated, to the virus, but such an effect wouldn't be seen until after the forecast period, because any such people are only now just starting to get sick. The most recent values of the 7-day CFR were 1.02%, 1.02%, 1.00%, 1.00%; over the past 28 days, values have ranged from 0.95% to 1.16%. Thus, I think it's extremely likely that the 7-day CFR could reach 1.26%, as that would require a faster increase over the next 21 days than the decline observed over the past 28 days and is not plausible. On June 5, I think the 7-day CFR will likely be in the range ~0.9% to ~1.1%, tending towards lower or higher values depending on whether vaccinations or the effects of behavioral complacency predominate, respectively. For deaths to be <1500, the 7-day CFR on June 5 would need to be <= ~0.63%. I don't think there's any chance of that happening.\nFor deaths to be >3000, the 7-day CFR on June 5 would need to be >= ~1.26%. I also don't think there's any chance of that happening.\nThus, I believe there is now a 100% chance that deaths will be in the second forecast bin. Update 5/20: Still forecasting bin 2. The 7-day CFR has been bouncing around a bit; I wonder whether the numbers are just getting so small that we're seeing more noise.

Previously, the 7-day CFR was declining by 0.1% every ~10 days; perhaps it'll stretch out to ~15 days? If it stretched out to 0.1%/15 days, then the 7-day CFR would be just under 0.8%.

However, JHU cases are inevitably going to be slightly different. On their website, their 7-day average cases/day for the past week is 184 = 0.2k smaller than the nytimes number. They will also increase case counts over time with back reporting. But suppose their number ends up being 0.2k smaller than the nytimes number. Then the total JHU deaths for the week could be slightly lower, realistically no lower than 7 * 33.0k * 0.007 = 1617, still firmly in bin 2.

Expertise and treatments have become more effective at preventing deaths over time, particularly in countries with more robust heath systems, and especially so now in countries with widespread vaccine distribution. In the US from mid-March to Mid-April for example, the rolling 7-day av. case rate increased from a low of 55K to a high of 72K, but in the related period (allowing for ~15day lag of course)  the number of deaths dropped 15%.

Cases are continuing to decline very slightly more slowly than my linear forecast. Current projection (R^2 = 0.995): 33.1k 7-day average of cases/day on May 15. So far, this prediction has been 1) 32.2k, 2) 32.6k, 3) 32.9k, 4) 33.1k. 8 more days to go. Will it end up around 35k? Based on the last 4 days alone, it could also be 31.8k.\nThe 7-day CFR is still on track to be 0.68 on June 5.\nThen total deaths for week ending June 5:\n7-day CFR on June 5, total deaths\n0.0068, 33.1k * 0.0068 * 7 = 1576, today's best estimate\n0.0065, 33.1k * 0.0065 * 7 = 1506, today's lower bound\n0.0071, 33.1k * 0.0071 * 7 = 1645, today's upper bound\n0.0065, 32.2k * 0.0065 * 7 = 1465, using lowest case projection so far and lowest 7-day CFR = current lower bound\n0.0068, 35k * 0.0068 * 7 = 1666, projecting cases to May 15, best projected estimate?\n0.0065, 35k * 0.0065 * 7 = 1593, projecting cases to May 15, one possible lower bound\n0.0071, 35k * 0.0071 * 7 = 1740, projecting cases to May 15, best projected upper bound?\n0.0065, 31.8k * 0.0065 * 7 = 1447, projecting cases to May 15 based only on the past 4 days, a better lower bound? So, today's prediction is for just over 1,500 deaths in the forecast period, and somewhere in the range from 1,447 to 1,740 deaths, slightly more into the 2nd bin. Cases continue to decline more slowly than each day's linear forecast for 3 days in a row now, but time will tell. Cases could equally end up under 32k.

This forecast relies on cases continuing to decline, on a linear forecast downward in the 7-day average of cases/day through May 15 (9 more days of data), and on a linear projection for a continuing decline in the case fatality rate (CFR) through June 5. Cases: Linearly projecting 7-day average cases/day from April 14 forward to May 15 (3 weeks before June 5; R^2 = 0.995), the 7-day average of cases/day on May 15 will be ~32.9k/day. So far, this prediction has been 1) 32.2k, 2) 32.6k, 3) 32.9k, so there is some variability in this forecast, and it's possible that cases are slowing ever so slightly more slowly than linearly. Need to watch this carefully. CFR: 3 week lag in deaths after cases. Before vaccinations, deaths were 1.7% of cases diagnosed 3 weeks before. Now, the 7-day average of deaths/day is 1.0% of the 7-day average of cases/day 3 weeks ago and has been at 1.0% for the past 7 days; I'll call this the \"7-day CFR.\" The 7-day CFR was 1.1% for 10 days, from April 20 to 29. There are 30 forecast days left. Projecting linearly and allowing 10 days per 0.1% reduction in the CFR (i.e., 0.01%/day), the 7-day CFR will be 0.7% or possibly as low as 0.6% by June 5. An excessively precise forecast is 0.68% => 0.0068 +/- 0.00013 (std dev); the largest error in this forecast since 4/19 is 0.0003, which happened once. Unfortunately, this question's forecast will need that level of precision because it's right on the line between forecast bins. The downward trend in the 7-day CFR needs to be watched to see whether it slows down.

This forecast relies on that trend continuing, on a linear forecast downward in the 7-day average of cases/day through May 15 (11 more days of data), and on a linear projection for a continuing decline in the case fatality rate. Deaths today are from cases confirmed 3 weeks ago (on average). Before vaccinations, deaths were 1.7% of cases 3 weeks previously. Now, the 7-day average of deaths/day is 1.0% of the 7-day average of cases/day 3 weeks ago and has been at 1.0% for the past 5 days. The confirmed case fatality rate (CFR) was 1.1% for 10 days, from April 20 to 29. There are 32 forecast days left. Projecting linearly and allowing 10 days per 0.1% reduction in the CFR, the CFR may be 0.7% or possibly as low as 0.6% by June 5 (excessively precise forecast ~0.68%). To answer this question, it would be useful to project 7-day average cases/day forward to 3 weeks before June 5, or May 15. Linearly projecting cases from April 14 onward (R^2 = 0.984), the 7-day average of cases/day on May 15 will be ~32.2k/day. If the 7-day average of deaths/day on June 5 is 1.0% of the 7-day average of cases/day on May 15, then the 7-day average of deaths/day on June 5 would be ~32.2k * 0.010 = ~322. Then the total deaths for the week would be ~322 * 7 = ~2254. This is likely an upper bound, as the CFR will likely continue to fall. If deaths were 0.5% of cases, then the total would be ~32.2k * 0.005 = ~1125. This is likely a lower bound. If the 7-day average of deaths/day on June 5 is 0.7% of the 7-day average of cases/day on May 15, then the 7-day average deaths/day on June 5 would be ~32.2k * 0.007 = ~225, corresponding to 225 * 7 = 1,575 deaths in the week ending June 5. If CFR = 0.6%, then the 7-day average deaths/day on June 5 would be ~32.2k * 0.006 = ~193, corresponding to 1,350 deaths in the week ending June 5. To forecast to an excessive level of precision, if CFR = 0.68%, then deaths for the week would be 32,151 * .0068 * 7 = 1,530. So, my prediction is for just over 1,500 deaths in the forecast period, somewhere in the range from 1,350 to 1,575 deaths, and my subjective 95% confidence interval is about 1,125 to 2,254. The number likely wouldn't be as high as 2254, but it also likely wouldn't be as low as 1125. I will assign slightly more weight to the lower forecast bin.
