The UAE is aggressively rolling out 3rd doses, including giving the powerful Pfizer vaccines to top up those who previously got Sinovac.  I'm extremely hazy on the formula for herd immunity and I suspect there really isn't one for C19. You can't really plug in 1\u20131/R0 when immunity is less than full for those previously infected or fully vaccinated and different studies give you different numbers. However, just about every expert says the herd immunity threshold from vaccination is 90%. Even the naysayers will say something like: \"Herd immunity is impossible. It would take 90% of the total population being vaccinated!\" It's kind of pointless for an amateur like me to get into the weeds on various degrees of immunity to the delta variant and try to plug in numbers. I would probably get the math wrong anyway. However, now that the 90% threshold has been passed for at least some degree of vaccination, I'm betting the UAE is at herd immunity, especially considering that aggressive masking requirements are still in place.

The term \"herd immunity\" is fraught with a lot of suboptimal thinking (to be diplomatic), but in the case of the UAE, 90% of residents have gotten at least the 1st dose. Contrast with  Gibraltar, which is not 99% vaccinated as widely reported but is in reality more like 80% because they are not vaccinating anyone under 16 and have a higher population of children per capita than does the UAE. I am no expert on herd immunity, but from the papers I have seen through Google Scholar, I can tell there is a huge difference between having 80% of your population highly resistant to an infection and 90%. That's because if you invert it, you see that a 20% non-resistant population is double a 10% non-resistant one! The UAE is also vigorously distributing 3rd doses, in contrast to Gibraltar which has not yet begun to do that, so \"fully vaccinated\" has a stronger meaning in the UAE.  As a Persian Gulf monarchy, an additional advantage that the UAE has from a public health standpoint is the ability to be very strict with its masking requirements. Here's one example: https://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/ph1or5/fine_for_lowering_mask/ If you lower your mask for even a moment, and a policeman sees it, you get an immediate fine.
