One justification for this discrepancy is that even if Tories don\u2019t get a majority, it will take some time for a new PM to be selected, which could take us beyond Dec 31. For example, if Tories get the largest minority they will take a crack at forming a government and negotiations with the Scottish party and the Lib Dems will follow. Or if Labour is given the chance to form a government, then it will have to negotiate with the same parties which will take some time as well. But how high is the probability for that?

And the average from the the FT poll tracker ( https://www.ft.com/content/263615ca-d873-11e9-8f9b-77216ebe1f17 ) run through those same two sites predicts a Conservative majority of 84 / 70. Analysis: In the raw popular support, the Conservatives seem to be averaging the same overall support that they had on polling day in 2017; all the polls (except the Independent's) have them within the margin of error on the 43.43% they got that year. Labour support, however, is way down, with the Liberal Democrats way up. The Brexit Party seems to be polling ahead of UKIP's 2017 results, though it's small enough that polling errors might be an issue. It is notable that many polls are only polling Brexit Party in constituencies where it's running, which is substantially fewer constituencies than UKIP was running in in 2017. So, there are perhaps two paths to Labour managing to recover. The first is Johnson making a serious blunder like May did on long-term care and scaring voters currently voting their Brexit preference into swapping to a \"Stop the Tories\" vote. The problem with that is that everybody remembers what happened to May, and is presumably going to do his best to avoid that. The second is anti-Brexit voters currently supporting the LibDem/Green/Cymru alliance looking at a Conservative majority and deciding they prefer Labour's wishy-washiness to Johnson being able to push through his deal. The problem with the second is that a good deal of the anti-Brexit coalition is from a \"Brexit is bad for business\" perspective, and neither Corbyn's comments on the sort of Brexit he wants nor his new back-to-the-Seventies Labour manifesto do anything but push that sort of voter away from Labour."], [74102, "2019-11-23T03:56:37Z", [0.0, 0.21, 0.0, 0.79], ""], [1624, "2019-11-23T02:30:44Z", [0.02, 0.0, 0.0, 0.98], ""], [62808, "2019-11-23T01:22:24Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [172, "2019-11-23T00:57:01Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.0, 0.85], "I am beginning to waver.

(Of course Corbyn supporters can say that they were right all the time as they have known all along that there is no problem where the answer is not to spend more money.) A good policy for Corbyn would be to say that the NHS would fully pay for care of the elderly. Mrs May's support collapsed in 2917 when she announced that the elderly would not be covered for social care, so I guess the reverse policy would get millions of old people worried about dementia care costs to switch from Conservative to Labour overnight. Even if it only gave BJ a scare so he was forced to also promise the same it would help Labour because it would be yet another uncosted Conservative promise that would probably not be delivered and spoil the Conservatives chances at the next election. And if BJ did deliver it he would have to raise taxes to pay for it, which would also be a black mark for the Conservatives.

Re-enforced by the decision of the Supreme Court, the delays to Brexit by parliament by a coalition including many who say they want to stop Brexit. Labours nuanced position is partly caught up in being seen as delaying it and will be difficult for it to pitch against a far simpler \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d. The split in the leave camp is between the Conservatives and The Brexit Party. Since the summer the Brexit party has gradually seen its support decrease from the high point of the European elections to around 10%-11%, that support has gone to the Conservatives who in the poll of polls are averaging around 34-35%. Key to the Conservatives will be maintaining that position and squeezing the Brexit party support even more. Nigel Farage should not be underestimated however the previous performance of UKIP at elections never fulfilled the promise of expectations of their supporters. The remain camp is split between several parties with labour trying to straddle both camps. Labours average polling on the poll of polls is around 24-25%. With Lib Dem\u2019s around 18%. There is a big issue of how good polling companies are and recent years they have performed poorly not calling the referendum itself and the last election as two examples. So we have to be very careful about putting too much faith in the numbers. The conservatives have managed to so far secure the position as the change candidates shoring up their support and the queens speech was full of sweetners for working class voters on the NHS, police funding etc. They are currently outflanking labour from this point of view. Now we shouldn\u2019t underestimate Jeremy Corbyn however, last time he was seen as the insurgent and change candidate and last time he was up against Theresa May. His task will be harder this time against a formidable campaigner and voters have had a lot longer to assess him and currently labour and his polling is at the lowest ever. It won\u2019t be so easy this time for them. However it shouldn\u2019t be ruled out completely that he and labour will start to squeeze the minor parties but the question is how much they can gain from this. One advantage for labour is that the conservatives have potentially run out of allies in parliament, it has advantages and disadvantages for the conservatives, although I would expect the DUP to repeat their confidence and support if push came to shove. Whereas Labour would stand a better chance if it was the biggest party or a larger party in a hung parliament to not necessarily have a coalition but possibly a confidence and supply arrangement with one or two parties. I have more or less ruled out a leader from another party or a new conservative leader. History and current evidence does not support those conclusions. But at the moment the strongest likelihood is either a conservative majority or them at a similar level in a hung parliament all of which favour BJ remaining prime minister.

The first question is whether any party will win a decisive enough victory that they will be able to form a government or if there will need to be a coalition.  The UK is currently divided after the Brexit vote with a majority (albeit a slim one) voting in favor of leaving the EU.  Aside from the intricacies of the problems with Brexit itself, the main issue at this point is that some parties are pushing hard for delays or in the case of the Lib Dems a reversal in Brexit altogether.  It is likely that this will turn into a referendum on which party best represents the \"political will of the people\".  I also think the uncertainty is weighing on the masses.  With Brexit inevitable, it is likely that the people will back the Boris Johnson and his Conservative Party as he has continued to pledge to deliver a Brexit (even reckless no-deal Brexit).  The clear conclusion for anyone who is either Pro-Brexit or has resigned to a Brexit whether in favor originally or not is to back the Conservative Party.

A GE (according to the BBC) needs a gap of at least 5 weeks between the date it is called and the date it is held because Parliament needs to be closed for 25 working days. A GE will not take place in Christmas week, and  a GE in the week before that would be very unpopular. By my calculation the earliest GE possible if it were called today would be 28th Nov. \nIn order to call a GE today parliament would need to vote with 2/3 MPs supporting the plan. This seems very unlikely as that would require Labour to support the plan, and Labour has said they will not support a GE before A50 has been extended. I take this to mean they would not vote for a GE before 1st Nov. (In case BJ managed to somehow cancel any extension offered or the EU failed to offer the extension.) Its also unlikely that Labour would want Parliament closed in the next two or three weeks.) So I think that only leaves the week in which 12 December is in,  which a GE could be fitted in.  Other ways to hold a GE include a Short Bill (where MPs pass a Bill that says the Fixed Term Parliament Act is suspended. That would be easier to pass than the 2/3 of MPs vote, but that would take a few days to pass and then presumably the Opposition Parties would vote against it if the vote was held before 1st Nov. So that would also not get a GE before 12th December. To get that through BJ would need to  be supported by all the Conservatives that he has thrown out of the party and the DUP. I don't see why they would want to help him (the ex-Conservative MPs would lose their seats, the DUP would probably lose seats.) The SNP and LibDems are  keen to get an election, but I doubt that they would want to annoy Labour who they might need voting support from later.)   The No Confidence vote route would not lead to a GE before Jan if Corbyn waits until after 1 Nov to trigger it as the process on this route takes 7 weeks. But that would only happen anyway if Corbyn called No Confidence and then failed in getting made PM. It looks very unlikely that Opposition MPs plus Conservatives who don't like BJ, would call No Confidence in BJ but this appears to be the only way that a Labour PM could happen before 1st Jan.\nIf a GE did happen it seems very unlikely that Corby would become PM. It would probably give the Conservatives the most seats and might give the Conservatives the majority.

Yes, it seems very likely that there will be a general election (>95%). A general election takes 5 weeks to conduct [1] so there is enough time to hold one before 2020.  All of the major parties (Con, Lab, Lib Dem, SNP) seem to be keen to go ahead with an election once the chance of a 'no deal' Brexit has been mitigated against. As it seems certain that there will be an extension agreed with the EU after the Letwin amendment was passed by parliament this weekend the barriers to a general election seem to have dropped. Will there be legal action that forces the current PM out before 2020? Very unlikely (<5%). It doesn't seem like there is enough evidence for this to happen. So this makes it likely that Boris Johnson will be leading the Conservative Party into the next general election. UK politics do seem to be largely about leaders (my supposition) so the current polling isn't likely to be invalidated soon. Will there be a vote of no confidence in the current PM that replaces him as leader of the Conservative Party? Again, very unlikely (<5%). Boris Johnson was only recently elected by this Conservative Party and won convincingly. Will there be a vote of no-confidence in the current government that creates a stable government able to stay in power beyond late November 2019 (five week lead-in for election)?  It doesn't seem like there is an appetite for this once an extension with the EU has been agreed (<20%). Who would win a general election? Current polling suggests that Conservatives have 35% of the vote and Labour 25% [2]. The last election saw Labour come from a low of 25% 04/04/2017 to 40% of the vote at the election 08/06/2017 [2]. In the same election, the Conservatives won 42.4% of the vote having had around 46% 04/04/2017 (high of 47% 11/05/2017)[2]. Both main parties are bleeding support to the Brexit Party and the Liberal Democrats in a reversal of what happened in the run-up to the 2017 general election (swap Brexit Party for UKIP). Conservative Party has indicated that they will not go into coalition with the Brexit Part [3].\nSNP have indicated that they would not enter a coalition with any party but would be willing to enter a confidence & supply agreement if the terms were right. I\u2019m sorry but I can\u2019t find a reference for this.\nThe Liberal Democrats have said that they won\u2019t support a Labour government under Jeremy Corbyn even in the event of a hung parliament (4). The first past the post system makes it very unlikely that any party other than Labour or Conservative would be able to form a government. In summary, I think there will be a general election and it will essentially be a contest between the incumbant and the Labour Party. Current polling suggests a Conservative win but this picture was similar in the run-up to the last election as well where the end result was only a 2.5% difference between Labour and Conservative. I believe the gap in the polls will narrow in an election campaign but it is likely that the Conservative Party will end up forming a minority government. 1. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-49004486\n2. https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/united-kingdom/\n3. https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/09/23/boris-johnson-promises-tories-will-not-make-pact-nigel-farages/\n4. https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/23/jo-swinson-rules-out-lib-dem-pact-with-labour-under-jeremy-corbyn"], [76701, "2019-10-20T15:39:32Z", [0.5, 0.3, 0.0, 0.2], ""], [80185, "2019-10-20T12:55:21Z", [0.2, 0.2, 0.05, 0.55], ""], [29907, "2019-10-20T11:03:46Z", [0.02, 0.1, 0.02, 0.86], ""], [78237, "2019-10-20T10:55:15Z", [0.03, 0.4, 0.03, 0.54], ""], [79906, "2019-10-20T09:56:04Z", [0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.9], "I'm revising my forecast in view of recent develoemts.

The other menchaism for a new PM would be a GE. Labour has stated that a vote of no confidence or GE would not be supported by the party until a deal on Brexit was passed. Without the support of Labour MP's, 245, the Govt would be short, 28 votes, of the two thrids required, 433 votes, to call a GE. This again, is significant and I'll attribute one third to it, 19.33 %, and subtract this from 38.66 % to arrive at 19.34 %, rounded. I also considered time frames for a GE. For reasons I've discussed elsewhere on this thread, a GE within the next 2 weeks is unlikely. This would require the support of Labour whom have stated that Brexit must be completed prior to any election. Calling a GE following 31 October puts it in November, with a possible election date in December. I don't view this as likely given its Xmas period, holidays, and so. While I can't rule it out completely, I'll half the remaining third of 19.34 % to 9.67 %, rounded to 10 %. Depending on next week, I may revise further.

As there remain 2.5 months till the end of the year, this gives a 7% probability of decay. But that depends wildly on how the probability distribution peaks: the probability at the beginning could be lower or higher, so lets say from 4 to 14%. Outside view 2: in this case we ignore Cameron, and take May as the quintessential example of a PM under Brexit conditions. She survived about five crises before resigning: 1 vote of no confidence, 3 defeats for the first version of May's deal, plus a modified version that could not even made it into a vote. However the number of crises could be counted differently depending on the criterion used. Assuming that her resignation was a 50/50 event at the moment it did happen, then if we notice that (1-0.13)^5 = 0.493, this gives a 13% probability of resignation (or being ousted) after a crisis. Resignation only equates a new prime minister with the pass of time, which means that if Boris Johnson resigns at the end of November or later, there will be no new PM till 2020. If it is a vote of no confidence, this could happen faster and the window could extend to mid-December. According to outside view 2, we must find which are the pending crises till the end of November and for each compound a 13% probability of resigning, being kicked out, etc. The only crisis in sight is Super Saturday, 19th of October, and the crisis is not bound to happen as there could be the promise of a deal in sight. If we assume a 50% of a crisis, we end up with a 6.5% of being kicked out, or a 7% after rounding. To this we can add a 3% that Boris decides to resign in order for another person to send the extension letter. Total 10% of resignation. Now notice that both outside view 1 and 2 yield very similar probabilities, indicating that it might be a good anchor after all. But it's Brexit and our intuitions might be challenged by the unbound creativity of the British parliamentary system. Now, resignation could be followed or not by a general election. This gives a large advantage to the conservative party regarding a potential new PM. If we assume a 50% chance of no election, we have a 5% probability of a new conservative PM. If there is an election, I will put the remaining 5% as 2% conservative, 2% labor, 1% other. Total: 7% conservative, 2% labor, 1% other. To do list: update from the inside view. Note to myself: check whether an update is required after the Queen's speech (14 October), EU council meeting (17-18 October) and Super Saturday / Doomsday Saturday (19 October)."], [1333, "2019-10-12T16:22:35Z", [0.4, 0.05, 0.05, 0.5], ""], [78587, "2019-10-12T14:24:01Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [63914, "2019-10-12T13:09:00Z", [0.2, 0.25, 0.5, 0.05], "December 5th currently favoured as the date.

Its possible that remain MPs could topple him in a vote of no confidence if they have no alternative to stop Brexit.

(Para. 1). There is one group, led by Germany, whose priority is to avoid a no-deal Brexit in order to minimize disruption to industrial supply chains. Another group, led by France, seeks to stop the UK from exploiting the opportunities for regulatory arbitrage. The French fear that a Singapore on Thames might undercut EU standards on social policy and the environment. Then there is a third group that wants the UK to reverse Brexit altogether, as a symbol of the fightback against the rising global tide of populism. What all three have in common is a lack of interest in agreeing to engage with UK prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s proposals for the withdrawal deal. They are reassured that the Brexit extension bill passed by the House of Commons has removed the threat of an immediate no-deal Brexit. Legal documents submitted to a Scottish court state that Mr Johnson intends to comply with the requirements of the Benn Act and seek a Brexit delay if he cannot secure a deal. But even if the deadline is extended once more, the EU should think twice before rejecting the latest UK plan. It is trivially true that an extension buys time, avoids disruption on the day, and maybe even opens up a theoretical path towards a Brexit reversal. But rejection would still be a short-sighted strategy. If the process is allowed to stray past the current October 31 deadline, the EU will have to live with the consequences of rejecting the deal (Para. 1-4). **\nReference\n**\nM\u00fcnchau, W. (2019).

Yes, someone from the Conservative, Labor or other Party occurs if:\na) Boris Johnson dies or resigns \nb) a vote of confidence occurs and a new prime minster is chosen\nc) a new election is called and a new prime minister is chosen.  From looking at this slate of outcomes, No seem way more probable than any of the Yes outcomes, especially in such a short time frame. The big question marks hanging over all of this are whether a vote of no confidence occurs and what happens with Brexit. If for some reason Boris Johnson is removed from office, it seems highly probable the conservatives remain in power.

Boris has been PM since the summer, so it would be highly unusual to see a change in PM so soon. It would be the shortest change since certainly since 1945 (starting from there as that is the modern era of politics, expanding the base rate past this is in my view unlikely to add any new information). To change a PM, the current PM has to resign, die, or lose the confidence of the House of Commons at which point a general election would USUALLY be held. However, since the introduction of the fixed terms parliaments act, a scenario in which a PM could take office without a dissolution of Parliament is now possible. But  although this is possible, it is unlikely given that such a scenario has not happened before. The new leader of a government in order to obtain an extension would be either from the Labour, Lib Dem parties or an Independent. As it currently stands, the Benn act compels the PM to ask for an extension if no deal is passed by the HoC. A deal could be passed in which the current PM would remain PM, as a coalition is not formed against him. There is the possibility that he resigns rather than ask for an extension, but the PM has the excuse that he was forced to do so by parliament or asks for an extension via another mechanism.  It seems like the most likely course of action that an extension is sought by some means, but then there is a general election, which could still happen by 2020 and change the PM. Given the polling numbers, I think that it is likely Boris remains PM.  This question is mainly tied up in what happens before the end of october, and there a lot of things that would have to happen for that to change, some of the highly unusual. I think that Boris will remain PM until the end of 2019."], [63835, "2019-10-02T22:54:07Z", [0.5, 0.17, 0.0, 0.33], "Today had the announcement of an 8-day prorogue and a challenge by the PM to the House to hold a no-confidence vote.\nThe queen's assent to another prorogue is not guaranteed (at least not to me) --- and her refusal would carry great symbolism.\nWatching the September House of Commons maneuverings gave me the sense that what holds back a no-confidence vote is who would serve as caretaker PM.  Corbyn seems to have no runway. So it would likely be a rogue Conservative who could get his party and enough splinter votes for a majority.\nThe PM had campaigned for hard Brexit in the absence of a renegotiated withdrawal agreement. He has since floated the idea of refusing to ask for A50 extension as Oct 31 approaches. This would be in the face of recent law that mandates the PM to ask the EU for the extension. \nI've also now read about a conflict of interest investigation underway re: Jennifer Arcuri and some  sponsorship/grants she or her company is said to have received while the PM was mayor of London.\nAnd then there are the unverified accounts of a personal relationship she may have also had with the then-mayor of London.

In a letter to European President Jean-Claude Juncker detailing his new proposals Wednesday, Johnson reiterated his opposition to the Irish \u201cbackstop\u201d \u2014 negotiated by his predecessor Theresa May to guarantee an open border on the island of Ireland. Johnson said his government was seeking a more decisive split from the European Union (Para. 5). \u201cIn these circumstances, the proposed \u2018backstop\u2019 is a bridge to nowhere, and a new way forward must be found,\u201d he wrote (Para. 5-6).\nThe E.U. has in the past resisted such checks on the grounds that they could jeopardize the delicate peace established by the 1998 Good Friday agreement (Para. 8).

Juncker cited \u201cpositive advances,\u201d especially the proposal to keep many Northern Ireland regulations aligned with E.U. standards. But he said that there were \u201cproblematic points\u201d related to Britain\u2019s apparent unwillingness to commit to keeping the border fully and permanently open (Para. 8-11). ***__\nReferences * Adam, K., Birnbaum, M. & Booth, W.
