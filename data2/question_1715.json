I\u2019m going to evaluate the factors that would move us up from there. Leaving aside the earth\u2019s variable orbit and tilt which affect global temperatures at a time scale far beyond what we\u2019re considering...\n\u201cThe combination of oceanic and atmospheric circulation drives global climate by redistributing heat and moisture\u201d [1] Of course, of interest to most humans discussing global temperatures today is the anthropogenic contribution to greenhouse gases in the atmosphere so I\u2019ll address that first. This is the primary analysis of the \u201catmospheric circulation\u201d and \u201credistributing heat\u201d portion of drivers of global surface temperatures. There are of course many gases that contribute to greenhouse effects in our atmosphere but the poster-child for the discussion typically centers around carbon dioxide (CO2). I will use CO2 as a proxy for all greenhouse gases as my conclusion as to its contribution to any prediction will apply broadly to any greenhouse gas. As of February 2020 the CO2 in earth\u2019s atmosphere was measured at 414 parts per million (ppm) [2] and is estimated to rise at about 2-3 ppm per year [3]. However, it is very difficult to correlate CO2 increases directly to global temperature increase simply because there are so many factors that determine what surface temperature will be [4]. Bottom line, extrapolating a CO2 level for any month going forward to predict temperature is very difficult if not impossible (at least today). I cannot draw out any contribution to move my prediction away from 0%. Going back to the drivers of global climate, from what I could learn, the primary consideration regarding the \u201coceanic... circulation\u201d is El Nino and La Nina [5]. There has been no significant ocean surface temperature changes that would drive either affect measured since early 2019 and (according to source) there is a higher probability of a La Nina affect (which would tend to drive surface temperatures down) than El Nino (tend to drive temps up) by the end of 2020 [6]. This would reduce the likelihood of reaching a 1.5C anomaly in the coming year but given the low probabilities and uncertainty of any change, I will not draw out any contribution to move my prediction away from 0%. The Solar Cycle can also be a factor in how much energy (heat) is actually hitting the earth. From the experts:\n\u201cThe current solar cycle, Cycle 24, is declining and predicted to reach solar minimum - the period when the Sun is least active - late in 2019 or 2020. Solar Cycle 25 Prediction Panel experts said Solar Cycle 25 may have a slow start, but is anticipated to peak with solar maximum occurring between 2023 and 2026\u2026\u201d [7].  No evidence to move the prediction away from 0%. Last, I looked at the \u201ctemperature anomaly\u201d (the difference to the 20th century average) data to determine how likely it will be that the surface temperature will vary from the 2019 anomaly of 0.99C. The average year-over-year (YoY) change for the last twenty years has been 0.09C and the maximum was 0.15C [8]. Working from the 2019 anomaly as a starting point and adding the YoY average, we\u2019d expect 2020 to come in around 1.08C and 2021 to be at 1.17C. Doing the same math with the max: 2020 ~ 1.14C, 2021 ~ 1.29C. Of course, these are yearly averages and any one monthly contribution could be higher. And the real value is likely not to be near the average at all but this gives us an idea of the range of temperature differences we've seen in recent history. I could not (easily) find the monthly data nor do I believe it is likely to change my conclusion given the YoY variance relative to the 1.5C in question. That being, just extrapolating on historical temperature anomaly changes, it seems very unlikely that any one month will exceed 1.5C in the next year. [Update: note, more discussion on using yearly vs monthly anomaly in replies] Conclusion: I\u2019ve found no compelling reason to move the prediction to a higher probability than \u201cvery near zero\u201d. However, I don\u2019t believe this warrants the \u201ccertainty\u201d of a 0% and so I will go with the obligatory whole-number prediction of 1% although I believe it is likely at least one factor smaller than this.
