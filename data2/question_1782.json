In particular, I think Russia is especially likely to carry out such an attack given its unprecedented meddling in the 2016 presidential election.  -----\nNext \u2014 has anything like this ever occurred? If not, is there a reasonable basis to think it will occur in this election? It seems like no voter data has ever been manipulated via a cyber attack, let alone have been outright altered. This was not even the case in the 2016 presidential election, when \"... Russian hackers stopped short of manipulating voter data\" [1]. This strikes me as being the result of geopolitical considerations \u2014 Russia surely knows that the cost to *actually* manipulating the results of an American election would be very high. So instead, Russia does what it does best: sow discord, cast doubt on the integrity of the election, and spread disinformation [2]. Russian state actors know that the costs to such activities are far lower than something as extreme as the outright altering election results or vote totals. \nThus, I think a repeat of 2016-style interference is *far* more likely than cyberattacks that alter vote totals and/or election results. Indeed, the actions that Russia has already taken to interfere in the 2020 presidential race are very similar to their interference activities in 2016 [3, 4]. ----\nFinally, even if a bad actor (in my view, probably the Russian state) *wanted* to carry out a cyberattack that alters vote totals and/or election results, could they do so? According to the AAAS EPI Center's Voting Technology and Security Program, \"Paper ballots, marked either by hand or machine, are the most effective way to ensure that the votes cast in an election reflect voters\u2019 intent. When every vote creates a paper trail that is routinely audited in a statistically-sound method, it provides assurance that votes have been tabulated correctly\" [5]. So, basically paper ballots are the most reliable and robust method of voting.  And guess what \u2014 California uses paper ballots! As per California Secretary of State Alex Padilla: \"Ballots cast in California are primarily cast on paper ballots. Historically, it has been asserted that paper trails associated with paper ballots allow for prompt detection of possible intrusions into the voting process. Therefore, voting systems that are direct record electronic systems must have the ability to provide a voter verified paper audit trail (VVPAT) for audit, recount, and manual tally purposes. Further, as a safeguard to ensure votes were accurately read and tallied, county elections officials are required to conduct a manual tally of one percent of the precincts as part of the official canvass of election results.\" [6] The use of paper ballots doesn't definitively preclude the possibility of tampering via a cyber attack, but it does make it *much* more difficult. ----\nOverall, I think such a cyberattack this year is very unlikely against *any* state in the US. And even if such an attack did occur, why would Russia go through the trouble of launching a cyberattack against a state that \n1) has at least mediocrely secure election infrastructure, relative to other states [7] \nand \n2) isn't even a swing state that could decide the election? Moreover, as others have noted, even if such a cyberattack did occur it would have to be made public before May for this to resolve positively \u2014 this is yet another reason to lean toward a no. I don't think the probability of such a cyberattack occurring and being disclosed in this time frame is actually 0%, but I think it's closer to 0% than to 1%.
