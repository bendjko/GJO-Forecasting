Lebanon has a history of taking a very long time to form a government and get a vote of confidence.  Due to Lebanon\u2019s sectarian power-sharing agreement, it is difficult under the best of circumstances to form a government within its sectarian political system.  According to the Economist (https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2018/12/21/why-lebanon-struggles-to-form-governments), it took two and a half years for Lebanon to elect its previous president, \u201cnine years to hold parliamentary elections, and 12 years to pass a budget\u2026Lebanon has spent nearly two and a half of the past 13 years without a government.\u201d  Political talks in Lebanon have a long history of dragging on for months with little resolution.    While the economic situation in Lebanon appears dire, the protestors have not been supportive of the new government in the media.  From a regional perspective, Lebanon will have a difficult time getting badly needed financial aid and support from Gulf countries due to the government being shaped by Hezbollah.  That being said, the new government may have the needed votes in Parliament to get a vote of confidence (https://www.lorientlejour.com/article/1203655/cap-sur-le-vote-de-confiance.html).   My dilemma with this forecast is given the severity of the economic situation and the growing protests, it would seem logical that Parliament would want to pass a confidence vote asap on a new government, but the historic base rate and precedent indicates that this situation will not end quickly.  Also, Lebanon has a long history of political strife, and the traditional power brokers are not involved with the current government.  There are ample opportunities for sectarian spoilers, which further decreases the chances of a confidence vote happening quickly.  The new government should be presenting its plan to Parliament soon.  Once that occurs, we should see some indicators based on Parliament\u2019s reaction and the reaction of the protestors to determine whether the vote of confidence will occur and whether the government has the needed support.  Since Parliament will be voting sooner than later, the forecast between now and 29 Feb is higher than the following months.  If the confidence vote fails, it most likely will take another few months to form a new government."], [56, "2020-01-25T16:32:25Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.05, 0.05, 0.8], ""], [74903, "2020-01-25T15:56:30Z", [0.0, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25], "This newspaper tell us that a majority could be find ( more than 65) https://www.lorientlejour.com/article/1203655/cap-sur-le-vote-de-confiance.html"], [1333, "2020-01-25T13:43:46Z", [0.0, 0.25, 0.25, 0.35, 0.15], ""], [691, "2020-01-24T15:11:19Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.08, 0.28, 0.63], ""], [31251, "2020-01-24T14:43:16Z", [0.0, 0.04, 0.09, 0.17, 0.7], ""], [81327, "2020-01-24T14:39:39Z", [0.0, 0.7, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1], "Though government is formed, Parliament has not yet voted.

It has little choice The prime minister's lack of communal backing will plague him in the months ahead, particularly when the government has to take tough economic measures. Young (2019) Dec 26, states that: Two things can be said about the efforts of Hezbollah and its allies in the Amal Movement and the Free Patriotic Movement (FPM) to push through a Lebanese government that would protect their interests, under the premiership of Hassan Diab (Para 1). First, they apparently succeeded in imposing Mr Diab on a large part of the protest movement that had been in the streets since October 17. And second, while the protesters may have taken a wait-and-see approach, Mr Diab does not enjoy support among his Sunni community. Having been named by several of the political parties associated with Lebanon\u2019s economic mismanagement, he will struggle to implement the structural reforms needed for the country to emerge from its financial crisis. While Mr Diab began forming his government last Saturday, the signs are that he would like to lead a government mainly of experts, even if named by the political parties. While this will not satisfy the demand of the protest movement for a government of independent technocrats, for now it could buy the parties in power time to breathe. With the economic situation deteriorating, people are inclined to give Mr Diab a chance. The Lebanese have few alternatives. The political crisis that started last October had dragged on for more than two months when Mr Diab was named. In the interim, the economy had come to a standstill as banks, in order to survive, imposed unofficial capital controls while severely reducing the amount of money people could withdraw from their accounts. The outcome was that many businesses, unable to operate effectively, laid off workers, provoking a rise in unemployment at the worst conceivable time (Para 1-4).\n*\nReference\n*\nYoung, M. (2019).

Lebanon has struggled to recover after its civil war that lasted 25 years (1975-1990) and has left the country in a critical state. Lebanon has one of the highest per capita debts. This has led to a large majority of people who can not afford to live in the country. This is just one of the major problems that thousands of people have been protesting to correct.  The political structure in Lebanon is probably one of the largest reasons for its political unrest. To create peace after the Civil war they made the government non-secular and required specific positions to be held by people of a certain religion. This bolstered the divide in the country and prevented any social changes from actually happening.  All these reasons and more suggest that this will not be decided in a reasonable time frame. The people have become outraged and taken to the streets and are demanding change and will continue to protest till actual change is made.

Since the resignation was accepted, a new government needs to be formed. Hence the \"vote of confidence.\" The article also discusses the process of forming a new Lebanese government. They say \"typically takes several months. It took Lebanon\u2019s factions 2 \u00bd years to agree on the current president, and it took nine months to form Hariri\u2019s now-embattled government.\"  The steps to forming a new government include \n1) The Council is formed by a Decree of the President of the Republic, which is countersigned by the Prime Minister. \n2) Within 30 days, the House of Deputies must approve the Government through a vote of confidence, which requires a simple majority. [2]  This suggests to me that this requires a new Prime Minster to be picked, which definitely will take time.  Let me know if I've gotten anything drastically wrong. I'm going to think more about the process of forming a government and try to establish a good base rate for how long these have taken in Lebanon's history.
