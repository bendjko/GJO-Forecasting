We last saw double-digit inflation in this category in Nov 2018, only 3 years ago. It took a subsequent 8 months for the annual inflation rate to drop below 5.5% (Jul 2019). In 2008 it took 4-5 months for a similar drop, but this coincides with the start of the Great Recession, which is highly unlikely to be a good macroeconomic model for the upcoming 6 months. In 1995-6 we went from almost 40% inflation to 15% deflation within a year; I have no idea why but I'd guess some kind of flare up in the US-Canada soft lumber trade dispute. Whatever the cause, probably not relevant to our current situation. So, in short, we don't have great base rates here.

According to IHS the US Paper Manufacturing PPI was at 162.6 in Oct this year vs 151.7 in May. The WW price trend for this commodity is much in line with US one due to globalization. And the expectations are that the current paper shortage will last at least up to the mid of 2022. There are other factors contributing to price increase like energy, transportation, inflation. Even if the shortage will phase out in the mid of 2022, the price will not immediately fall back to what is was before. In addition, there could be other factors that would push for a price increase even if the aforementioned ones will cease to affect the price trend. Sustainability is one of them.\n28-Jan-2022.
