As of this moment, Apple is trading at about 2.09T US dollars market cap. That's not super tight, but we have another two weeks to go. Now that a vaccine is moving, at least in the US, the price of oil might move up, which could be enough to boost Saudi Aramco to first place.

I did a lengthy simulation to provide an answer. Here's what I did: I fetched daily open prices of Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Saudi Aramco for several years from Yahoo Finance. I turned the daily prices into logarithmic daily returns and calculated median and mean absolute deviation (MAD) for each of the four series. The median and MAD are the maximum likelihood estimate parameters for a two-parameter Laplace distribution (aka double exponential distribution) , which is a very good distribution to model daily logarithmic returns of various assets. See how the empirical kernel density estimates and maximum likelihood Laplace distribution probability density curve align nicely in the graph that I did: https://pasteboard.co/JzCO9Gd.png Next, I checked the amount of trading days left this year. This is 39. I then proceeded to do a random walk simulation of laplace returns for 39 observations. Next I put these observations into exponent function to get the percentage returns from logarithmic returns and calculated the product of all 39 elements of this vector. I repeated the above procedure for 10000 times for each of the different random walks. These simulations are the year end prices for each of the stocks. Finally, I checked the number of shares outstanding for each of the companies, multiplied simulated year end share values with the outstanding shares and for Saudi Aramco also multiplied it with SAR/USD exchange rate. The probability was now easy to calculate. I have a data frame of 10000 rows with four columns corresponding to market prices of each company. I calculated the share of these 10000 simulations, in which AAPL is the most valuable and that is 79,3 %. I did not calculate betas for the stocks - so basically only idiosyncratic risk is present in the simulation. With MSFT, AAPL and AMZN, this might be a problem, but as they are further a part in current Market cap than Aramco and Apple, I suppose it's not such a big deal. Most of the cases in which APPL is not the largest are due to ARAMCO and that is in a different industry and country. !!!!! THE _NO_ CATEGORY IS ERRONEOUS !!!!! The event probabilities in the question do not sum up to one, because these are not mutually exclusive events. If AAPL is more valuable than MSFT and AMZN, but less than ARAMCO, then in this case AAPL is not the most valuable company in the world so it's a \"NO\" case. But at the same time it is a \"No, but the most valuable in the United States\" case. The correct last category ensuring mutual exclusivity should be: \n\"Not the most valuable anywhere AND not the most valuable in the US, but the most valuable elsewhere\". Ideally, there should be four categories to account for each permutation \n(the most valuable in the US, the most valuable elsewhere): \n1. (TRUE, FALSE) = No, but the most valuable in the United States, \n2. (TRUE, TRUE) = Yes, the most valuable in the world, \n3. (FALSE, FALSE) = Not the most valuable anywhere,\n4.

Looking at another perspective, Brand Value, Apple is slightly ahead of Google in the Forbes 2020 list - https://bit.ly/3p0YONN Looking at the 'most valuable' company, the definition of valuable is usually referred to as the number of shares in issue multiplied by x value.
