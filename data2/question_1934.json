Despite this and widespread international condemnation, the coup continues and the military remains firmly in control of all three branches of the government. More than 7,300 protestors of the coup remain imprisoned across the country.  What would have to happen for the government powers to be released from military control? 1) A rightfully elected president would need to be seated / reinstated, 2) article 417 of the Myanmar constitution would need to be recognized (only sitting president may declare a state of emergency), and 3)  the elected president would need to reverse the invocation of article 418 (transfers power of executive, legislative, and judicial branches to Commander-in-Chief of the military).  Given that the rightfully elected president, Aung San Suu Kyi was convicted and sentenced to 4 years in prison (possession of walkie-talkies and COVID 19 protocol violations) on January 10th 2022, and is again being tried for corruption charges it is highly improbable that she will be returned to control of the country in the next 5 days.  The Commander-in-Chief of the military, Gen Min Aung Hlaing - who is currently in power - has stated that the military will form a true democracy on behalf of the people, and that democratic elections will occur once the state of emergency has ended. It is equally as improbable that the state of emergency will be ended, a presidential election will occur, and that the a president other than Kyi will be seated prior to February 5th.

It seems like the two primary factors which forced the military to at least make concessions to democracy were widespread unrest driven by economic decline  and the personal popularity of Au Sang Suu Kyi. Another contributing factor may have been a desire to strengthen relations with the United States in order to reduce dependence on China.  But Au Sang Suu Kyi\u2019s international popularity has declined significantly as a result of the Rohingya crisis.  Her ability to rally international pressure against the regime is limited, particularly when western democracies are confronting a host of internal problems of their own. The regime has only experienced a small handful of defections by low-ranking officers , which suggests a high degree of internal cohesion. This contrasts greatly with the opposition, which is divided between many different  competing groups.   The most likely scenario that I can see which would threaten military rule would be a) renewed unrest driven by economic decline  combined with b) an internal crisis of leadership caused by a sudden incapacity on the part of Gen. Min Aung Hlaing. Such a crisis could be intensified by divisions of opinion with regards to China on the part of senior officers.

Hence, the period of democratic rule in Myanmar is significantly shorter in the country's history since independence from Britain in 1948, providing the military with the capabilities to rule the country. Also other parameters of military rule remain the same, mostly importantly, regional powers continue the traditional policy of non-interference and are unlikely to apply sanctions or other restrictive measures against the junta, shielding the latter from EU/US sanctions. In addition, the (armed) opposition to the military, the Ethnic Armed Organizations (EAO) and newly established Popular Defense Units (PDU) do not have much in common apart from their opposition to the military and frictions over the course of action already emerged; EAOs may also use the current crisis to negotiate with the military. A difference to the pre-2011 period is the population's ability to stage a blockade of the large parts of the economy through the use of social media.

It seems it's heading more towards civil war. So Myanmar would need a military defeat for this to happen. I'm happy to have got it very wrong in this question. You can't improve without making mistakes.  In particular, my learning is that if the military refuse to yield against people power, the military can usually hold on but the state simply slips into a failed state / civil war situation. So it will then come down to whether the military leaders value their personal power of a little bit above the overwhelming needs of the state and people they hope to lead. And the answer in many cases is no. So going forward, in developing a better model for these types of qs, Q1 is, will the military shoot? In Egypt, they didn't. In Syria they did. In Venezualla they did. In Myanmar they did. In Tunisia they didn't. Etc. If yes, the regime will fall. Q2 is, will the tyrants in power value their personal power above that of the overwhelming interests of the state and people they seek to lead? If yes, the regime will compromise and / or fall. If no, the state becomes a failed state and / or enters a civil war. But this will then become long and drawn out. Q3 is, if the regime chooses failed state / civil war, will there be outside intervention? If they have a major backer or there is no significant interest from the West (Mayanmar) then no.  I suppose there is also another end state to consider: the regime succeeds in crushing the demonstrations and restores fear based deterrence. So my mistake was that I did not see how this could end while the people still were protesting. Now I can: civil war / failed state. What I at least have achieved by getting this wrong is identifying all the end states: the army does not fire and the regime falls; the regime has some heart and compromises or falls; civil war / failed state; and external intervention. Now, all I need to do is build a model that can map the current state of domestic and geo-politics to the final end state. Which is much easier to do when one is aware of all the possible end states. And thinking about it more, the model is simply this. Forecast the probability of each of these end states and then ensure the sum of these probabilities add to 100%.

These things may have provided an opening for the military coup that took place.

The judiciary is not much different. However, there is a possibility given international force that they might relent. That however, is extremely unlikely.

This is not an area I have looked into and this will probably hurt my Brier. Safest to just stay out. But who cares about my Brier? My forecast is my forecast. I know from previous discussions with @cafebedouin that the average probability for these types of questions is about 5%. However, this is not a normal case. There is one big big factor at play here that does not seem to have been appreciated in the above forecasts that substantially boosts the likelihood of the coup ultimately failing: that the coup replaced a democratic regime rather than simply replacing one autocracy with another. Further, this coup goes against a democratic result that had been announced and certified. Normally coups include faking election results and stealing elections before the results are announced.  These matter. Stealing an election is much easier to do before the results have been announced and validated because that's not a genie that can be put easily back into a bottle. And the people who had to fight to bring down a regime will be vastly more motived to fight autocracy after they have already succeeded  just a few years ago and the moral of the police force and the army to fight for autocracy will be vastly less.  And indeed there are signs of the police refusing to fight for the regime.  It really comes down to a taste of freedom. Once people have had that taste, it becomes much harder to ever take it away, at least by force alone. And Feb 22 gives a good amount of time for the regime to fall.  The counter argument is I haven't done a full analysis of these kinds of problems yet so there is a high risk that @cafebedouin's flat 5% could still be right.  But given the size of the political forces the coup leaders are going against, I think the probability is more like 90%. However, @cafebedouin's ideas are also convincing. 60% represents a fair balance. In this case, though, the 60% is literally weight I give my forecast * 90% + weight I give @cafebedouin's ideas * forecast. Usually, I try to prod further and see if I end up moving entirely to my version or the counter argument, but I can't do that so this is the best I can do.  I know my absolute brier therefore must be poor, because @cafebedouin's advice and my forecast are mutually incompatible. But with most people going for the low %ages, my relative brier can still do very well if my forecast is decent.

Also, the near neighbours of Cambodia, Thailand and the Philippines have declared it to be an \u2018internal matter.\u2019\nThe Military may have considered the recent visit by China\u2019s foreign minister Wang Yi, who praised the Myanmar Generals and support for the \u2018deserved role in the course of national transformation and development.\u2019  to have provided a nod of acceptance of the coup.\nThe Chinese news agency, Xinhua have described the coup as a \u2018major cabinet reshuffle\u2019 and by a refusal, by China to condemn it, may have given the Military extra confidence.\nHistory shows that the military will not necessarily step down in one year, given that it took twenty years from the 1990 election to complete a promised transition to democracy. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-55902070  https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/06/asia/myanmar-coup-what-led-to-it-intl-hnk/index.html  https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/2/1/who-is-min-aung-hlaing  https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Myanmar-Coup/Fear-and-ambition-in-Myanmar-Why-top-general-triggered-the-coup  https://thediplomat.com/2021/02/what-the-myanmar-coup-means-for-china/  https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/05/world/asia/myanmar-coup-china-united-states.html  https://www.businessinsider.com/china-russia-block-un-security-council-condemn-myanmar-coup-2021-2  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/01/myanmar-coup-us-and-china-divided-in-response-to-army-takeover-aung-san-suu-kyi  https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/02/03/asia-pacific/myanmar-army-election/  https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/explained-myanmar-generals-are-back-in-charge-but-for-how-long/articleshow/80648652.cms\n"], [45594, "2021-02-14T09:11:29Z", [0.1], ""], [96757, "2021-02-14T06:08:49Z", [0.02], ""], [29646, "2021-02-14T05:27:37Z", [0.01], "A minimal 1% in the spirit of \u201canything is POSSIBLE\u201d.\nNo past evidence that the Myanmar military is eager to surrender the power that it has seized."], [86554, "2021-02-14T02:20:44Z", [0.01], ""], [98108, "2021-02-14T02:09:38Z", [0.02], "Reducing my forecast because the military is responding to protests with more repressive measures.

Looking at the history of military rule in Burma, the shortest interval of military rule seems to be two years and that was in the 1960s.[1]  Since then, the military junta of the day has regularly extended its states of emergency for years of military dictatorship.  As others have pointed out, Chinese support for the military government bilaterally and in international fora give the military regime cover at the UN.    Japan has also been notable for its silence after the coup, highlighting its close ties with Burma regardless of the regime, which gives further space to the military to prolong its rule.[2]  Additionally, South Korea, Singapore, and Thailand have invested heavily in Burma.[3]  With all of those investments essentially stranded, those companies will be loath to alienate the military rulers.  They will not be shy about lobbying their national governments to protect their interests in Burma, lessening chances of regional pressure to end the military regime. Nobel Prize Winner Aung Sang Suu Kyi's shocking and seemingly heartfelt defense of genocide against the Rohinyga people has also undercut support by her traditional allies in the Western NGO and human rights community.[4]  Washington, London, Ottawa, and Canberra will continue to issue statements of concern, urging the resumption of civilian government.  Nonetheless, leaders in these countries will have even less pressure from human rights groups and NGOs to engage  meaningful sanctions or other levers of power to force the Burmese military government back to barracks.
