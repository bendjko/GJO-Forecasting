Taxes are added by federal, state, and local governments. As of 2009, the federal tax is 18.4\u00a2 per gallon for gasoline and 24.4\u00a2 per gallon for diesel (excluding red diesel). Among individual states, the highest gasoline tax rates, including the federal taxes as of October 2018, are found in Pennsylvania (77.1\u00a2/gal), California (73.93\u00a2/gal), and Washington (67.8\u00a2/gal).\" Taxes are not only a way of generating revenues and cash flow for the state and federal budget, but also a way of influencing behavior (\"nudging\"), pricing negative externalities (\"external cost\", e.g. air pollution), changes in taxes are therefore a steering instrument to stimulate (lower taxes) or crowd out (raise taxes) demand for certain products, one of which gasoline is due to its high potential as an air pollutant. Thus, \n(i) it appears likely with a new federal government coming and a renewed focus on environment protection that the federal taxes on gasoline will not fall in absolute terms, and may even rise relative to production cost, transport and other lumps and their respective shares in the final retail price. As the retail price (as stated in the quote above) of the EIA statistics apparently contains taxes, these will have an increasing influence on the price per gallon for the remainder of this question and will prevent the retail gasonline prices to fall significantly, even if demand slows and/or crude oil markets see a price slump (barred a total collapse of the world oil market, once more).\n(ii) To the contrary, states with a traditional focus on environment protection, such as CA, states with a distressed budget, or states with certain issues caused by transportation may use tax raises on fuels in times of low fuel prices (~2.00 USD) to come up for increased spending without causing a major economic footprint or slowdown. Election year is almost over, so a rise in fuel taxation may be one of the first impertinences and hardships which politics may agree on without fear of the voter's rage.\nBoth federal and state taxes therefore have a smoothing, stabilizing effect on retail gasoline prices and also appear to put a \"floor\" price to it. A tax raise is even more likely during winter, as the seasonality of retail prices suggest falling prices: due to being \"off-driving-season\", but also because of the cheaper \"winter-grade fuel\":\n/\"Summer-grade fuel\" vs. \"Winter-grade fuel\", and \"transition season\"\nAs the name of the EIA's source \"Weekly U.S. All Grades All Formulations Retail Gasoline Prices\" suggests, fuels vary with respect to grade and formulation.\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20150530115419/http://auto.howstuffworks.com/fuel-efficiency/fuel-consumption/summer-fuel.htm\nBecause of a differing blend, different additives and different minimum requirements in Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP),\" up to 20 different types of boutique fuel blends are sold throughout the U.S. during the summer\", which tend to have a higher retail price due to more costly ingredients, an increased demand during driving season, and due to temporary refinery shutdown in the \"transition period\" (March to May) from winter-grade fuel to summer-grade fuel.\n(\"Depending on the part of the country, the EPA's standards mandate an RVP below 9.0 PSI or 7.8 PSI for summer-grade fuel. Some local regulations call for stricter standards. Because of these varying RVP standards, up to 20 different types of boutique fuel blends are sold throughout the U.S. during the summer.\"\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20150530161621/http://auto.howstuffworks.com/fuel-efficiency/fuel-consumption/summer-fuel1.htm )\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20150530210718/http://www.epa.gov/otaq/regs/fuels/r01051.pdf As the question started on 17 November 2020 and ends on 02 March 2021 at the latest, it spares any transition season:\nThe summer-to-winter transition begins in September already and is supposed to be completed already, as the main goal of the EPA's reformulation requirements was the prevention of toxic SMOG in metropolitan areas during summer.\nThe next transition, winter-to-summer, will not begin before March/April 2021.\nThus, there are no big erroneous jumps to be expected until 02 March 2021 due to a transition.\nHowever, the \"transition season\" and the difference between \"winter-grade fuel\" and \"summer-grade fuel\" can provide an explanation and outlook crucial to the resolution of this question.\nThe source offers the following trough of retail fuel prices in 2020 so far:\n  2020-Mar     03/16  \t2.343    \t03/23  \t2.217    \t03/30  \t2.103   \n  2020-Apr \t04/06  \t2.022    \t04/13  \t1.951    \t04/20  \t1.910    \t04/27  \t1.870    \t  \t   \n  2020-May \t05/04  \t1.883    \t05/11  \t1.941    \t05/18  \t1.969    \t05/25  \t2.049    \t  \t   \n  2020-Jun \t06/01  \t2.064    \t06/08  \t2.123  Average prices of less than1.95USD were recorded only in the four weeks between 14 April 2020 and 10 May 2020 (as reported on 20/27 April; 04/11 May 2020).\nIn the light of the \"transition problem\", I interpret the trough as follows:\n(i) \"winter-grade\" gasoline retail prices do not necessarily have to be low, or below 2.00USD, as the first three weeks of March 2020 (03/02: 2.514  -  03/09: 2.468   -  03/16: 2.343) show. Even in the five months of winter 2019/20 before, which probably are the classical \"winter-grade fuel season\", the retail gasoline price always averaged between 2.511USD and 2.742USD. The \"2019 Abqaiq\u2013Khurais attack\" had happened on 14 September 2019, causing strong oil market disruptions for the second half of September 2019.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Abqaiq%E2%80%93Khurais_attack\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/Brent_crude_oil_futures_prices%2C_August_2019_through_January_2020_%2849467835818%29.png\nEspecially for October and November 2019, the Weekly U.S. All Grades All Formulations Retail Gasoline Prices proved to be remarkably resilient to falling oil prices, and only after the military strike killing the Iranian general Soleimani on 02 January 2020, even retail gas prices joined the crude oil price in a prolonged decline.\nFrom this, one could extract some kind of \"political risk/uncertainty premium\" of about 10 to 12% or 25 to 30 USc per gallon, about the reaction of the US and their allies to the \"2019 Abqaiq\u2013Khurais attack\".\nThe Iranian retaliation has thus far not happened, but times (election result, transition of power-period to the new US administration) are pretty much still the same uncertain, and things could get worse still. Starting from the most recent price at 2.211USD, we could observe a risk premium added of 0.15 to 0.30USD per gallon, which could very well persist throughout the next months, which would drive the retail gas prices to about 2.35 to 2.50USD c.p. .\n(ii) I assume the price collapse of March to April 2020 is a more or less unique coincidence of failure from different parties, which is unlikely to repeat in that magnitude.\na) first, the 45 POTUS administration lacked knowledge, competence to analyze and probably intelligence about the true potential impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the global and domestic economy and the requirement to put in place a future strict mandate (from the public health perspective) as late as January and the beginning of February 2020. Instead, they chose to repeat China's conciliations, probably to avoid putting at risk the Chinese - U.S. trade and tariff negotiations to end the economic war between ChiMerica.\nb) When the 45 POTUS administration had received the intelligence and knew about the potential fall out, which according to the \"Woddward tapes\" happened in mid February 2020 at the latest, the administration failed to communicate a clear-cut response and explicit advisory to actors of the economy during following months. While some individuals of the administration still believed the virus would \"magically disappear\" (\"no impact on the economy or demand\" hypothesis), those voices who demanded an early enforced physical distancing, curfew and economic shut down included, were either silenced or undercut by a wall of noise and mixed messaging. The administration chose to cover up the expected impact, probably due to a major conflict of interest inherent in the facts that 45 POTUS is a \"business owner\" (Trump organization) himself, and that 2020 as an election year is especially sensitive with respect to unemployment rate, GDP growth, stock market performance (401k accounts). While the president advocated a \"full throttle economic activities\" response (\"Reopen the economy!\" \"Reopen schools!\" \"Reopen houses of worship!\" \"Liberate Michigan!\" and so on...) and pressured governors to end state mandates, even republican governors had to follow the logic of \"flattening the curve\", and, as a result, the U.S. had neither a strategy nor stringent communication nor a population educated enough to protect themselves.\nAmid this mixed messaging and downplaying, which lasted at least until the infamous \"total authority\" press conference on 13 April 2020,\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3QXrQDTDYo\nc) decision makers in the economy, in our case in the oil and refining industry, were likely blindfolded for weeks and month, likely for the entire spring, and due to the WH administration's\nfalse claims\nfalse data/falsified data\nincomplete data (e.g. testing volume and case confirmation)\nincomplete information made erroneous and wrong forecasts and predictions about the 2020 fuel demand, and, this is my key point, about the demand for the remainder of the 2020 \"winter-grade fuel\" season, which is likely not marketable during summer, even under pandemic conditions.\nd) based on wrong demand projections, the oil industry reacted late in reducing capacity in production or purchase of crude oil. As the whole process of reducing capacity requires preparation and (I would guess) at least two to four weeks of time, and the entire industry was hit by the widespread shut down in April by surprise (45 POTUS promised everybody it would not happen; the governors of both sides of the aisle found out it was inevitable), my assumption is that the refineries will have produced more than ample amounts of \"winter-grade fuel\" and they failed to adapt on short notice. Even if the oil industry had lowered capacity in e.g. refineries quicker, there would have been backlogs of crude or products in other places. The oil industry, it seems, is especially vulnerable to market impairments, and by and large depends on a swift, smooth and frictionless production and delivery more than other industries.\nd) As a consequence, from March 2020 the daily production of \"winter-grade fuel\" must have exceeded demand largely while exporting product could not offer relief: the global reduction in economic activity (and thus energy consumption) happened synchronously and the situation with an excess supply was similar in most G20 nations. As a consequence, storage and tankers were filled, however, they were unfortunately filled with \"winter-grade gasoline\", as the disruption happened *before* the transition season in refineries.\ne) During mandatory shut downs and even after these had ended, gasoline producers were likely forced to dump their inventory of \"winter-grade gasoline\" to the domestic market via the gasoline retailers at any price to rid themselves of it ahead of the April/May \"transition season\", and to free storage. That way, the average retail gasoline price came under pressure from a combination of differing parties, relations, practical constraints and timing coincidence, which likely is the main reason behind the sharp and prolonged drop in average prices between, say, 17 March and 18 May 2020. As mentioned before, I suggest it is very very unlikely, that this \"once-in-a-century\"-constellation of factors, which caused a drop of 0.08USD or 5% at maximum below the threshold of 1.95USD/gal, repeats, and if it does (maybe to a weaker extent), not only is there far more knowledge about this particular virus and an awareness of \"pandemics\" as a major threat to business in general, but the industries will have used the time over summer to increase preparedness, to elaborate detailed contingency planning, a \"playbook\" for market disruptions, and increase business continuity efforts and co-ordination with e.g. administrative bodies, banks, insurance companies etc. in order to safeguard a reliable production and supply, and avoid another widespread collapse.\n"], [13306, "2020-12-07T06:36:15Z", [0.08], ""], [94872, "2020-12-07T04:45:33Z", [0.15], ""], [75824, "2020-12-07T01:49:55Z", [0.14], "Outside view: \nSince 2010: total # of weeks = 569, # of weeks under $1.95/gallon = 10 (5 in 2016, 5 in 2020). % of weeks under $1.95 = 1.76%. # of weeks until March 2 = 12. Odds that no weeks under $1.95 before March 2 = (100-1.76)% ^ 12 = 80.8%. So odds that we will have 1+ weeks under $1.95 before March 2 = 100 - 80.8 = 19.2%. That's my baseline. Inside view: \nWhat determines gas price? 1) Crude oil prices; 2) refining; 3) distribution and marketing; 4) taxes. [1] I don't see refining, distribution, marketing, or taxes dramatically changing between now and March. And about 55-60% of gas price is determined by crude oil price anyway.  What determines crude oil price? 1) Spot prices; 2) Supply OPEC; 3) Supply non-OPEC; 4) Balance; 5) Financial markets; 6) Demand OPEC; 7) Demand non-OPEC. All of this is taken into account in EIA's Short Term Economic Outlook (STEO) seen in the first slide here [3]. EIA actually forecasts that crude oil will slightly increase in 2021, although beginning of 2021 (scope of this question) appears to be flat. Market futures also appear to be flat through 2021. This leads me to lower from the 19% baseline. OPEC: Latest OPEC meeting said they would keep oil production stable for rest of 2020, and start increasing demand slowly in 2021 with \"monthly meetings of oil ministers to reassess the balance of supply and demand.\" [4] It appears that OPEC will be monitoring this closely and adjust production accordingly so that prices don't drop too low. Also leads me to lower from my 19% baseline.  Forecast: so from the 19% outside view, I'll lower down to 14% given EIA forecast, market futures, and OPEC meeting. Will lower each week going forward.
