Like with the Emperor's new clothes, the negotiating power of the bully would be deminished if the smaller countries believed in their cooperation on the grounds of the higher principle. The US might choose to be the first to firmly oppose Chinas behaviour. This would give others the option to be safer, as followers.\nBut since the US has been in the intermittent habit of bullying since WWII, it would have to signal something for its behaviour to be felt to be predictable, if it wanted to increase likelihood of inspiring followers.

Thus, it is unclear how the virus from nocturnal bats found the way into the intermediate host and how the selection for optimal human propagation could take place there. The intermediate host hypothesis is therefore regarded as less likely\" This seems to largely agree with another recent paper in Scientific Reports [2] (different authors, different institutions, different countries - Australia vs Germany): \"It remains to be addressed whether SARS-CoV-2 is completely natural and was transmitted to humans by an intermediate animal vector or whether it might have arisen from a recombination event that occurred in a laboratory handling coronaviruses, inadvertently or intentionally, with the new virus being accidentally released into the local human population. [...] our study suggests that from the beginning of this pandemic the SARS-CoV-2 S protein already had very high, optimal binding to hACE2. There is minimal early evidence of selection pressure to further optimise binding, in contrast to what has been seen with other zoonotic viruses at the time of their entry into the human population.\" What seems to be remarkable in the SciRep paper is that, as explained by co-author Nikolai Petrovsky, their research was based on the assumption that \u201cthis was another natural transmission\u201d, but the results of their analysis \"shocked us\" and were \"not what we were expecting\". \u201cLooking just at the data you\u2019d say that it looked like this virus was designed to infect humans,\u201d he said [3]. On the IC investigation front itself: arguably no surprise for anyone here, but officials warn that the ongoing 90-day investigation ordered by president Biden might come up inconclusive [4]. But there are other possibly interesting hints in the WSJ article: \"The National Security Agency, the officials said, will look for clues in its vast stores of intercepted foreign electronic communications, most of which aren\u2019t analyzed in real time. The effort is being aided by experts from government labs, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health and other parts of the Department of Health and Human Services. Experts outside the government are being consulted, as are allied intelligence agencies.\" Regarding the possible dynamics unleashed by the apparent lift of censorship on the lab leak scenario, I have speculated earlier [5].

While the origins were not fully understood, it was believed to originate from bats. \"Coronaviruses are found in a diverse array of bat and bird species, which are believed to act as natural hosts\" The SARS outbreak is the most similar to the current COVID-19 pandemic because they both began in China, normalizing the lack of transparency from the Chinese government about these two outbreaks. The origins of SARS are still unconfirmed 18 years later, making it unlikely that the US intelligence agency will be able to perform an investigation that definitively says that the lab leak theory is more likely in 6 months.  The COVID-19 pandemic has a few defining features that we should not ignore when answering this question. Because most investigations into SARS have been scientific in nature (and not through intelligence community) it is possible that there has been information hidden from the scientific community the intelligence community could find out. The Wuhan Institute of Virology has been studying coronaviruses and there have been a few lab leak infections in the past.

Disease-causing pathogens have escaped labs before (https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/05/when-viruses-escape-the-lab/371202/), but there is not much data from virologists that indicates that the COVID-19 virus was created in a lab. In fact, there is a lack of any signatures of genetic manipulation. Considering all this information, let's say there's a ~20% chance the disease came from a lab.  Secondly, even if the US found such evidence, the intelligence community would have to decide whether or not to act on such information. China has significant international influence, such information could cause an international split. The US would also have to be quite certain with such a claim, as it would would have significant geopolitical consequences. I believe, however, the US would likely reveal such evidence if they found it, given current US-China relations (say 75% likelihood).  Finally, the time frame of this question is only 6 months from today. I think that finding evidence of a lab leak and announcing such information in such a short amount of time is quite unlikely.

First, it's worth noting that when Biden called for further reporting, he said two elements in the IC lean towards the human contact scenario and one leans towards the lab leak scenario, but the majority of elements do not believe there is sufficient information to assess one to be more likely than the other.  (1)\nOriginally, the \"lab leak\" theory was considered a conspiracy more than an actual possibility. Since it has rose to prominence, no new evidence has come out supporting the hypothesis that a lab leak was more probable, instead, many scientists, including David Relman, author of a letter calling for more exploration, are simply asking for more exploration of the topic. \"I am not saying I believe the virus came from a laboratory,\" says Relman but instead he believes the WHO report were too decisive in their conclusions. It seems most of the calls from experts to explore the lab leak possibility aren't out of evidence of a lab leak but rather a lack of conviction in the human contact hypothesis. Scientists involved in the WHO-led mission identified four hypotheses that they ranked in order of likelihood:\n-Likely to very-likely: virus spilled over via an intermediary host species\n-Possible to likely: the virus spilled over to humans directly from an animal reservoir\nResearchers who have analyzed its viral sequence have concluded that it doesn't have the genetic signature of a lab-created virus.  Thus, I would say the lab leak plausibility is significantly below 50%. Probably closer to 10-30% (2)\nBiden's task force was given a 90-day deadline. It's unlikely given how long researchers have been investigating the outbreak as well as how few IC individuals likely have access to areas of interest in Wuhan that those 90 days will be able to uncover anything definitive. Based off the past year, it seems unlikely that China will be wholly cooperative with further investigations into the lab. Finally, the repercussions of publicly saying a lab leak was more likely would be extreme, so it seems unlikely that that would be the official US IC position without any evidence.  The SARS outbreak took 15 years to identify the source. The most likely scenario seems to be that in 90 days Biden or the IC announces that there is not enough evidence to conclude lab leak or human contact, and it seems unlikely that the position will change to officially supporting the lab leak hypothesis in the next 6 months. \nThus, a 20% chance of lab leak being real coupled with a 30% chance of the IC finding enough evidence by the end of the year gives around a 6% chance.

The Ebola virus, which was discovered in 1976, is thought to have spread to humans from bats or nonhuman primates, but scientists still haven't identified the origin from a specific animal host.\u201d FTA:\nAt the heart of those suspicions is the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a research facility founded in the 1950s that was the first in China to receive the highest level of biosafety clearance. The institute's lab has a biosafety level of 4 (known as BSL-4, the highest level), meaning it is equipped to study the world's highest-risk infectious agents and toxins, those that require the strictest biocontainment measures. It's that designation, and the lab's location in the city where the outbreak was first reported, that made the institute an early suspect. Separately, a U.S. intelligence report disclosed that three researchers at the Wuhan institute sought treatment at a hospital after they fell ill in November 2019, as The Wall Street Journal first reported in May.\nDuring the WHO-led investigation this year, officials at the Wuhan institute said all staff members had tested negative for Covid-19 antibodies. Its leaders have been adamant that the virus didn't escape from the facility, but the Chinese government's reluctance to share records and test results has cast suspicion over what the lab's scientists knew \u2014 and when.\nAlthough they are far from conclusive, the intelligence report and the mine workers' mysterious illnesses have been presented as circumstantial evidence that scientists at the Wuhan institute were studying risky coronaviruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 and that the virus may have escaped from the lab, perhaps after an employee became infected. Chan acknowledged that it's \"definitely possible\" that the virus evolved in nature but added that all options should be kept on the table because neither the natural origins theory nor the lab leak hypothesis can be ruled out.\n\"All the evidence right now is circumstantial, and it's consistent with both lab and natural origins,\" she said. https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/lab-leak-theory-science-scientists-rcna1191 New Info Continues to Feed Lab-Leak COVID-19 Theories, at Least Circumstantially Yet another recent issue was a study published by Jesse Bloom, an evolutionary biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, who posted the study in the pre-publication website\u00a0bioRxiv.

But a large portion of US voters dislike or even hate brown skinned Muslims, so this isn't bothering them. The downsides of publicly stating that a Chinese lab accident is more probable than not are:\n(1) Asian Americans already are being increasingly targeted by hate groups on account of the pandemic. This would make it much worse. Indeed, some might be tortured and killed and their businesses damaged on account of such an announcement. These people also vote.\n (2) This would harm US/China relations without providing any benefit.

But what is near certain is that this is a very unlikely event. Here's my dig. If the military cannot say that the recent UFO videos are likely aliens, I doubt they can with COVID. Additionally, infectious diseases do not seem to be their forte, per se. And with Biden in command, who respects scientific analysis, it would be quite awkward for the intelligence community to go counter of scientific \"consensus\" like the Trump admin did, which is for the intel community to say that this virus originated from an animal in contrast to current and independent scientific conclusions. There have been two U.S. conclusions and one international conclusion by the WHO which all did not say that the lab accident theory is most probable. Further, if forecasters were to adopt the \"decrease due to passage of time\" theory, by now the probability should be less than 15% if the question had started at the start of the pandemic. For these reasons, very unlikely seems rational. I found a base rate of 20% derived from experts running simulations about this sort of hypothesis. To compliment this base rate, someone else here also mentioned that 75% of the time these things originate from natural origins. That leaves us with 20 and 25% chance that this thing did in fact leak out of a lab. Let's average these two figures and come up with 22.5%. Now you need to reduce this. Perhaps due to the time constraint and other restrictions that this question asks, there is a 10% chance that this theory holds. Therefore, we have a 2.25% chance. But even still questions remain that would help us ponder this question over the next several months. One question I have is how many animals are estimated to have an infectious disease compared to the amount of disease samples that Chinese labs possess? The answer to this will help us to estimate how much weight each theory should have. Other questions must be explored.

We know that the WHO concluded that there was insufficient evidence in support of the \"lab leak\" theory; however, many have questioned the WHO's probe, and the 'lab leak' theory has certainly gained more traction recently --  particularly after it was discovered that researchers from the Wuhan Institute of Virology displayed symptoms of COVID as early as November 2019. Several scientists have backed an investigation into the possibility that the virus came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, arguing that the that there has been no evidence of COVID in bats (the former CDC Director Robert Redfield is 'convinced' that it came from a lab). Others (including Fauci and current CDC director Walensky) have pushed back pretty strongly against this idea.

Perhaps the most thorough (albeit sympathetic) review for the lab leak hypothesis is a (lengthy\u2026)  investigative piece by Katherine Eban in Vanity Fair (June 3, 2021) [4].  Links do not abide in the article, but we learn about intelligent (albeit non-expert) investigators calling for the hypothesis to be taken seriously, like Nicholas Wade [5][6], Jamie Metzl [7], and Filippa Lentzos [8][9], as well as for the DRASTIC team [10][11]. IMO, one of the most interesting pieces of information in Eban\u2019s article is that a team in the State Department\u2019s Arms Control, Verification, and Compliance bureau had begun an investigation on the possibility of a lab leak (who ordered that still remains unclear) in 2020, ultimately resulting in a press statement [12] and a fact sheet [13] issued by the Department during the very last days of the Trump administration. But what is even more interesting is that Chris Ford, Assistant Secretary at the time, published his own account [14] shortly after the Vanity Fair article, answering to accusations of a cover-up attempt for the lab leak hypothesis. In his account, Ford (a China hawk himself) argues (convincingly, IMO) that the results of the subject investigation favoring a lab leak could *NOT* stand serious outside criticism. Nicholson Baker also has a thorough (lengthy\u2026) piece in the New York Magazine, written slightly earlier (January 2021) [15]. Other facts that may be useful for anyone interested in an informed forecast here: - It took no less than 15 (!) years to trace back the origin of the SARS virus [16].\n- Back in 1979, at least 66 people died in Yekaterinburg (then in Soviet Union) from pneumonia. American spies picked up clues about an anthrax lab leak, but leading American scientists voiced confidence in the Soviets\u2019 claim that the pathogen had jumped from animals to humans. It took no less than 13 years (and the collapse of the USSR) for the truth to be revealed (it was a leak from a military lab indeed) [17].\n- Israeli start-up Rootclaim has used Bayesian analysis to estimate the probability of an accidental leak at 83%; their methodology is open for inspection [18].\n- There are recent rumors from SpyTalk for a top Chinese official having defected to the US, carrying info about the Wuhan Lab (h/t @aaseawaf15) [19][20]\n- The (usually well-informed?)

Still, I doubt that the US, the WHO or any other stakeholder in the process of analysis will be granted \"unfettered access to virus samples, lab records and personnel, eyewitnesses, and whistleblowers\" or any other utilizable information by China in time for this question. If China finally allows more in-depth scrutiny into the site and documentation - probably in a gesture to exonerate themsleves publicly from the allegations - I find it very likely that those responsible will have made sure upfront that no traces lead to incriminatory evidence.\nMy main point is, whatever happens next with respect to China's international relations, the intelligence community will have difficulties to convincingly tip the balance of probabilities over the edge towards a laboratory accident.\nThis is particularly true when the Analytic Tradecraft Standards as outlined in the ICD 203 are rigorously respected [e.g. \"(1) Properly describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and methodologies\" with respect to political motivation, \"(3) Properly distinguishes between underlying intelligence information and analysts' assumptions and judgments\", \"( 4) Incorporates analysis of alternatives\", \"(7) Explains change to or consistency of analytic judgments\" with respect to a lack of new information available] and a substantiated theory is required in line with IC Analytic Standard b): \"Independent of political consideration: Analytic assessments must not be distorted by, nor shaped for, advocacy of a particular audience, agenda, or policy viewpoint. Analytic judgments must not be influenced by the force of preference for a particular policy.\" There's a risk analysts of the IC may present a theory \"shaped for\" the American public (which already has a large share of believers in a lab accident thanks to constant right-wing propaganda and narratives spread) in order to justify and gain the backing for a certain basic diplomatic intention underlying the future approach to the PRC or distract from the responsibilities not met or faulty decisions made by the former 45 WH administration during the pandemic, which caused a lamentable suffering and loss of lives to be mourned, in an attempt to re-write history by certain individuals and/or parties to appear eligible in their political future. How widespread political partisanship ingrained into the structures of the intelligence community or among analysts really is and how much continuity there is within the IC from one administration to the next is hard to judge, but could prove to be critical for this question.  The Pompeo documents indicate a  political motivation, but at least they honorably acknowledge the lack of pivotal facts and information.\nMy overall impression is that this status is not going to change much to justify a change in the current views of the IC as far as I know them and as far as they are public.

It is also clear that its suppression as a legitimate theory was more due to political bias or group think than it was the organic result of impartial empirical inquiry. Early last year The Lancet published a paper stigmatising the LLH as conspiratorial, which turned out to be organised by the person in charge of the organisation conducting gain of function research in the Wuhan Institute of Virology. This blatant conflict of interest was not declared. It seems the international epidemiological community's predominant incentive so far has been to protect its own, as communities do. Secondly, Trump politicised the virus (China Virus, Kung Flu) which then further stigmatised the LLH by its subsequent association with Trump. Therefore no respectable public figure could be seen to support the LLH without being seen to associate themselves with Trump, which no respectable public figure wants to do. Such is the way political partisanship poisons science. It always seemed exceedingly improbable that COVID-19 (a bat coronavirus) would happen to originate in a city which happened to have a laboratory dedicated to meddling with bat coronaviruses, and for that to be a coincidence. This also being a city situated hundreds/thousands of kilometres away from any significant bat population.  It is also worth noting that China is doing everything it can to test its wild animal populations to find the virus. This is natural, given this is absolutely in its interests. Despite its extensive attempts, it has been unable to do so thus far. The longer China fails to achieve this, the more probable the lab leak hypothesis becomes. However, the current lack of available and conclusive proof to confirm a lab leak hypothesis, and China's continued efforts to suppress the emergence of such evidence given its overwhelming interests to do so and its constitutionally secretive nature, means that the Intelligence Community will likely feel that it has insufficient grounds to officially declare a lab leak more probable than zoonotic origin before 2022. Both LLH and zoonotic origins remain legitimate possibilities and much more information is needed for institutions to be able to officially declare one more probable than the other.

But the Covid-19 outbreak, which has now led to 2,666 deaths and over 77,700 known infections, is thought to have originated in wildlife sold at a market in Wuhan in early December, prompting a massive rethink by authorities on how to manage the trade. China issued a temporary ban on wildlife trade to curb the spread of the virus at the end of January and began a widespread crackdown on breeding facilities in early February. The country\u2019s top legislative officials are now rushing to amend the country\u2019s wildlife protection law and possibly restructure regulations on the use of wildlife for food and traditional Chinese medicine.

So many people conflate \"laboratory accident\" with genetic engineering. The virus could have been released as a result of research activities at any point from sample collection to actual research to waste disposal. If a research worker in the field got Covid by walking into a bat cave to collect bats with insufficient PPE, or when obtaining virus samples from bats outside a bat cave with insufficient PPE or precautions, would either of those be a laboratory accident? Zoonoses and research accidents are not mutually exclusive events, and the concept of \"laboratory accident\" is vague and poorly defined and is used by very many people to mean many different things. But suppose we say that a laboratory accident means that a sample of the virus was in a laboratory and was released from that laboratory by accident, regardless of whether it was being stored or studied intentionally or whether its presence was incidental to some other work. How would we know whether the virus was released as a result of an accident? We'd know it was released in a lab accident if 1) someone finds a sample of it in a freezer, or 2) the intelligence community finds communications or data showing that someone had it in their freezer (and the only way they'd know that is if they had sequenced it). (Many early sequences were not released publicly, and many early patient samples were ordered destroyed; China was and is not eager to explore this possibility.) A variety of other information would offer supporting evidence, such as if any lab personnel had positive antibody test results very early on (supposedly they didn't, but those tests aren't perfect). There is no \"smoking gun\" signature of genetic engineering. Furin cleavage sites occur naturally. Moreover, if gain-of-function work was occurring, it would have been done at at least BSL3 if not BSL4, and I would expect that they would know what they are doing. Researchers who work at BSL3 and BSL4 are serious about what they do; accidents do happen but are uncommon. I think the most likely lab accident scenario would be from work characterizing bat coronavirus samples at BSL2, ironically most likely with the goal of understanding and mitigating their pandemic potential. It is also more plausible that BSL2 work could have been done sloppily or that there could have been a mistake. It would be much easier for a high-risk pathogen (that should be handled at BSL4) to escape BSL2 than BSL3 or BSL4. And we know that thousands of bat coronavirus samples were being studied at BSL2 at 2 institutes in Wuhan. So for me, this question really boils down to 2 other questions: 1) Does or will the intelligence community have evidence (communications, copies of lab notebook entries, sequence data, other data sets, etc.) that SARS-CoV-2 was present in a lab in Wuhan? 2) If so, would they release that information in the form of an assessment that a lab accident is a more probable scenario? I have no idea what the answer to 1) is. I'm in the very good company of many well-respected scientists who think that Covid could potentially have been released as a result of a lab accident. From my point of view, an accident related to sample collection is perhaps as plausible as a zoonotic origin unrelated to research, because the researchers live in a megacity, and that gives any zoonosis in a researcher a much better chance of spreading forward to new hosts. Moreover, the researchers purposefully interacted with countless bats. But who knows what information the intelligence community has. (And also, zoonosis during sample collection wouldn't count for this question.) Answering my question 2), I would think that if they had conclusive proof that the virus leaked out of a lab in Wuhan, that we would probably already have known about it. I'm not sure we would hear about anything short of conclusive proof, though, because it would sour relations with China in a way that devolves into \"he said, she said\" and doesn't offer clear benefit to the US. So, to summarize: it's possible that SARS-CoV-2 became pandemic as a result of a lab leak. I suspect that if the IC had conclusive proof that it was, then we'd know by now. If they don't, then I suspect we wouldn't hear much about whatever information they do have, and I don't think we'd hear for many years what would amount to an inflammatory claim (whether true or false) that a lab accident is a more probable scenario. PS A number of people here take as evidence for the lab leak hypothesis that China tried to cover up the virus' spread initially, or that they locked down forcefully. I believe that China tried to cover up its spread for much the same reason that local party officials tried to cover up events at Chernobyl: they didn't want to have to admit there was a problem. (And they were also not unique in the world in not wanting to acknowledge that there's a problem.) That doesn't say anything to me about the origin of the problem. As for locking down forcefully, it could just as well be argued that they waited too long and should have tamped its spread starting weeks earlier. I would argue that they locked down forcefully because of lessons learned from SARS. Indeed, following some initial missteps, China shared a remarkable amount of data quickly and addressed the virus' spread quickly, vastly more openly and quickly than after SARS. Moreover, whether one agrees or disagrees with their methods, they proved that Covid spread could be stopped. This had never been done before with any potentially pandemic virus that was this contagious.
