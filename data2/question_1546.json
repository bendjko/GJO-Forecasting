I just discovered GJO a few days ago. I'm happy to be here! I chose my first forecast based solely on the criteria of \"ending soonest\" and oh boy did I pick a doozy! On first inspection here, I found the overwhelming prevalence of \"0% No\" forecasts to be puzzling. I've been working my way through the training & master class here, and based on what I've been learning, I did not expect to see *any* 100% or 0% forecasts once I started participating ... How can there be such certainty? I suspect that AOC's national status as a media darling may be clouding judgement here, along with some potential political biases in her favor from participants. I started digging for information that could lead fellow forecasters to such absolute certainty, along with information supporting even a slight possibility of \"No\". It was a challenge to sift through all the strong emotion on social media, and biased news outlets attacking either AOC or her main competition, Michelle Caruso-Cabrera. After a couple hours of research, I decided that, not only is there little particularly strong evidence of a certain win by AOC, there is evidence against certainty in that A) Her support within her local district is not nearly as unanimous as the national conversation would have me believe, and B) Voter turnout is likely to be even lower than in 2018, because of a combination of COVID and overconfidence in the outcome. In 2018, AOC delivered a major upset by defeating incumbent Joseph Crowley in the primary. However, voter turnout was only ~11% of eligible voters. With fewer than 30,000 votes total, AOC won by a margin of only 4,000 votes, in a district with over 200,000 registered Democrats. My intuition is that turnout may be even lower than 30,000 this time. There will almost certainly be AOC supporters and detractors alike who stay home because they're convinced she has it in the bag, and don't want to risk the polls during the pandemic. https://ballotpedia.org/New_York%27s_14th_Congressional_District Further research for the case against an assured AOC victory led me to a poll from June 2019, conducted by an anti-AOC PAC. To be taken with a grain of salt owing to their obviously biased agenda; they found that, within AOC's 14th Congressional District, \"41.73% of her district is unfamiliar with Rep. AOC ... She has a more than 2:1 ratio of unfavorable (50.88%) to favorable (21.37%) in public opinion ... Only 8.91% were opposed to Amazon coming to the district, while 36.01% supported the Amazon HQ deal ... Only 10.75% thought she had their best interests in mind in quashing the Amazon deal - 32.60% said she didn't. ... 33.44% are ready to vote against her, and only 13.30% would vote for her.\" https://www.stoptheaoc.com/ - Anti-AOC PAC who conducted the poll https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/washington-secrets/poll-aoc-unliked-untrusted-unwanted-in-her-own-ny-district - Washington Examiner article about the poll https://www.allsides.com/news-source/washington-examiner  - AllSides.com analysis of Washington Examiner as a right-leaning publication Digging through the recent Twitter feeds of both AOC and her challenger MCC reveals toxic sentiment against both players. It appears that most of the social media engagement is from people outside the 14th district, but it does reveal that there is nothing like unanimous support for AOC, or against MCC. https://twitter.com/AOC https://twitter.com/MCaruso_Cabrera Given the above key points, as well as all the other fragments of information I found, I believe this contest will be far more of a craps shoot than most people realize. So, though I do think it's more likely than not she will win, it's not clear at all whether it will be by plurality or majority, and I will not be surprised in the least if we see an upset *of* AOC in 2020, just as we saw an upset *by* AOC in 2018. A final thought after investigating this question: even if she does lose this primary, I do feel confident it will not be the last we see of her on the political stage. A large number of recent articles from media outlets leaning to both sides are speculating that she may seek to upset Sen. Chuck Schumer in the 2022 Senate primary ... stay tuned. \ud83e\udd13"], [86233, "2020-06-22T17:57:40Z", [0.98, 0.02, 0.0], ""], [36132, "2020-06-22T17:23:53Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [92178, "2020-06-22T16:34:22Z", [0.85, 0.1, 0.05], ""], [86855, "2020-06-22T16:33:33Z", [0.65, 0.35, 0.0], ""], [92379, "2020-06-22T16:26:31Z", [0.99, 0.01, 0.0], ""], [88560, "2020-06-22T14:13:57Z", [0.97, 0.02, 0.01], ""], [29304, "2020-06-22T03:03:40Z", [0.85, 0.14, 0.01], ""], [92379, "2020-06-21T23:35:40Z", [0.85, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [92518, "2020-06-21T17:36:14Z", [0.88, 0.04, 0.08], ""], [529, "2020-06-21T16:33:25Z", [0.96, 0.04, 0.0], "Comment deleted on Jun 21, 2020 05:29PM UTC"], [89135, "2020-06-21T01:18:52Z", [0.95, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [89379, "2020-06-20T19:49:31Z", [0.8, 0.2, 0.0], ""], [81304, "2020-06-20T17:58:03Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [529, "2020-06-20T15:53:26Z", [0.96, 0.04, 0.0], "FWIW, a comment in the linked source claims a 52% approve 23% disapprove poll rating for AOC via Morning Consult.

New York uses a closed primary process (where the selection of a party's candidates is limited to registered party members). I have a feeling that the energy and enthusiasm that made AOC win the primary in 2018 are still present this year.  I have a feeling that the Hispanic population of NY's 14th congressional district will overwhelmingly vote for her in the primary.  I am forecasting that AOC will win a majority of votes in NY's 14th congressional district democratic primary.  I will monitor the events until June 23, 2020 and make any adjustments to my forecast if necessary.

Base rate of 92% for first two buckets.  Inside view:\n- 2018 primary: won 56.7% of the vote [1] \n- 5 Democratic challengers: \"Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s most coherent Democratic challenger to date is former longtime CNBC correspondent and anchor Michelle Caruso-Cabrera. Caruso-Cabrera, who published a book in 2011 called You Know I\u2019m Right: More Prosperity, Less Government, is a skeptic of big government and a proponent of free markets. Caruso-Cabrera is a relatively recent Democratic party member who registered her candidacy last week, appear to be preparing a more serious challenge as she seeks to take on Ocasio-Cortez in the Democratic primary.\n\u201cCaruso-Cabrero is as wild a card as AOC was two years ago,\u201d said Sheinkopf. \u201cCaruso-Cabrero is likely to lead a spirited challenge and could be very competitive.\" [2]\n- Endorsed by Sanders, frontrunner for presidential Democratic primary\n- Netflix documentary in 2019 may have raised awareness for voters that did not know about her [1]\n- Big criticism from challengers is that she opposed bringing an Amazon headquarters to NYC, losing 25k potential jobs. [3] [4] \n- $3.4 million raised [2]\n- Favorability April 2019: \"Fifty-two percent of the freshman congresswoman\u2019s registered constituents in The Bronx and the north-central portion of Queens view her favorably, compared to 33 percent who view her unfavorably. Fifty-nine percent of voters [in the Sienna poll] say that they are proud to have Ocasio-Cortez representing the district, and 61 percent agree that while many of her ideas on the economy, climate or healthcare may not become law soon, they think she is moving us towards a more fair and just society.\" [5]  I think inside view supports AOC being reelected, but Caruso-Cabrero is a wild card who will try and resonate with more moderate Democratic voters. Lowering base rate to 80% for first two buckets. Majority/Plurality: Unsure how to assign probabilities for majority/plurality split because I could not find any data on Democratic primaries, I believe because the incumbent has been unopposed. I think Caruso-Cabrero is the only real challenger, so if the race is only between the two of them, the winner will win majority (>50%). Assigning 90% probability to majority (80% * 90% = 72%).
