The ability of the US to enhance its influence in the Asia-Pacific area to arrest the potential domination and rise of China.

And that new understanding greatly changes my view on this question. Under TPA, the administration of the day has to formally notify Congress 90 days prior to commencing negotiations on a trade agreement.  I'm not a trade expert, but I could have easily and should have more closely read that CRS brief to which I offered a link!  If we do not see a Congressional notification by April 1, then this question is unlikely to be a \"yes\" within its terms of reference, even if the administration makes lots of news with a high-profile public diplomacy push to talk about trade in Asia.    Combined with my better understanding of TPA mechanics, I would note President Biden announced a major policy review of all national security agencies on February 4 with a central goal being refocusing foreign policy and national security agencies toward promoting the U.S. middle class.[1]  In particular, the memo states that a so-called \"Deputies Committee\" meeting will take place by April 4 to \"discuss challenges and opportunities for refocusing United States foreign policy to meet the needs of the American middle class.\"  The Deputies Committee is one step below the Principals Committee composed of the president, vice president, and cabinet secretaries who meet to decide U.S. policy. Further research also pointed to many statements during the campaign that a Biden administration would prioritize domestic recovery before embarking on \"disentangling\" the former administration's trade deals.[2] Another strike against a \"yes\" on this question now that I have a better understanding is that the USTR nominee who would lead negotiation strategy has not been confirmed by the Senate.  If she is confirmed in February, that still only leaves two months until the 90-day window for TPA would close. I am also pessimistic that any path exists right now to extend TPA when it expires in July.  Even without the filibuster, which still exists, I don't see Sherrod Brown, Bernie Sanders, Kirsten Gillibrand, Sheldon Whitehouse, Ed Markey, Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar, or Elizabeth Warren voting to extend TPA right now without a knock down drag out fight over incorporating climate change and even tougher labor protections into the negotiating authority granted for TPA.[3]  It is hard to see enough Republicans in the Senate being willing to break from the past president's trade policy to counteract the large number of Democrats above. In light of this new understanding on my part of that crucial word \"formally,\" I am lowering my forecast significantly.

There will be much less enthusiasm and push from the multinational corporations to re-join CPTPP, and there is still a lot of concern from labor and environmental groups.

I am quite pessimistic about the U.S.'s early rejoining of the CPTPP in the current political environment.  It is unlikely that any coalition of senators exists to ratify the CPTPP in its current form, given labor union opposition and Republicans who continue to support the former president's trade policies.  Additionally, President Biden has made supporting the American middle class a central feature of his foreign policy.[1]  Most credible, independent analysis of the CPTPP find it would lead to U.S. job losses in manufacturing while modestly increasing GDP and overall employment through increases in the agriculture and services sector.  Manufacturing jobs in export-oriented companies are the holy grail of middle class prosperity, since they pay well above average for low-skilled workers, something that the new administration is not likely to treat lightly.  Nonetheless, in diplomacy, announcing symbolic but non-binding gestures, like commencing trade talks, are a low-cost way to signal priorities to allies, partners, and competitors.  \"Formally\" is doing a lot of work in the question's construction on beginning renegotiation.  It really has no legal meaning that I'm aware in this context.  Congressionally-conferred Trade Promotion Authority to guarantee an up or down vote without amendments on trade agreements in the Senate will expire in July 2021.[2]  If we get to August 2021 without any announcement by the administration and TPA continues to be lapsed, it would not be a good sign for entering renegotiation of the CPTPP.  Trade partners generally do not wish to negotiate with American administrations lacking TPA, given the likelihood of a death by a thousand amendments for trade treaties. China's muscular role in the region, especially inking its own RCEP trade pact create strong incentives for the new Biden administration to find ways to symbolize a return to an active strategic presence in the region.  Biden said during the campaign that the idea was a good one but that he would seek renegotiation to protect workers and the environment.[3] [1] ttps://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/29409/biden-s-foreign-policy-for-the-middle-class-takes-shape\n[2] https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10038\n[3] https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/bidens-first-foreign-policy-move-reentering-international-agreements"], [67232, "2021-02-13T17:35:41Z", [0.99], ""], [67232, "2021-02-13T17:34:44Z", [0.95], ""], [484, "2021-02-13T16:06:13Z", [0.9], "Up 15% to be above the consensus.
