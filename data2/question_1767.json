Updated 20200908 Further to my forecasts below, Suga's popularity continues to grow as the formal LDP leadership race got underway today - https://reut.rs/3h6k3Ix and - https://bit.ly/3hb9C6P. It is also clear that the only three left in the contest at this stage are Ishiba, Kishida and Suga. However, Ishiba and Kishida's popularity, both amongst public and the all important factions within the LDP are insufficient to carry them to the leadership position. Ishiba's plan to use Nintendo's Animal Crossing game to garner public suport (https://bit.ly/2ZfcBoj) has been abandoned for fear of contravening the games terms of use. Thus Suga appears the frontrunner. Hence my above revised forecast leaving a small margin for Ishiba and Kishida in the unlikely event some misfortune befalls Suga. Updated 20200904: Further to my forecast below of 2 days ago, see Asahi Simbun polls showing Suga's public accpetance - https://bit.ly/33dbozp and how Suga has overtaken Ishiba in the public poularity stakes. Suga also appears to have Abe's support - see https://bit.ly/3bEEqvD. Suga therefore seems to have all the internal LDP support required for him to become leader of LDP and hence the most likely Prime Minister to succeed Abe. Also see also https://bit.ly/330KDh9 regarding probability for Inad and Noda. 2020902:\nThe LDP decided a few days ago to limit the selection process to the parliamentarians and select prefecture represenatives thus avoiding an internal election amongst its 1m members. This decision allowed for a quicker appointment of Abe's replacement and the date is set for 14 Sept. (See WP - https://wapo.st/3jEK6Z1) Yoshihide Suga, a long time allay of Abe's who is fully conversant with Abe's policies and who is Chief Cabinet Secretary has receievd some backing from party heavyweights, is the most likely successor. Ishiba, who stood against Abe previously does not seem to have the support of the party heirachy, whereas Suga does. Ishiba's support comes from the broader party members and thus the decision to exclude the broader party from the vote has given Suga a boost.

As\u014d, who served as prime minister himself (2008\u20139), was formerly a key member of the Taiy\u016bkai faction led by K\u014dno\u2019s father, Y\u014dhei, who served as foreign minister, LDP president, and speaker of the House of Representatives... Ishiba Shigeru: Political Heavyweight Ishiba Shigeru: A more traditional candidate is 61-year-old Ishiba Shigeru (eleventh-term lower house member). Ishiba is the leader of his own faction, albeit a small one (numbering just 20 members) and has held several cabinet posts. Stressing his policy experience and expertise in national security, having led the Defense Agency and later the Ministry of Defense, Ishiba is calling for a wholesale revision of the Constitution\u2019s war-renouncing Article 9. Kishida Fumio: 61-year-old Kishida Fumio (ninth-term lower house member), currently chairman of the LDP\u2019s Policy Research Council. Kishida\u2019s faction claims direct descent from the venerable K\u014dchikai, whence sprang many of Japan\u2019s mainstream conservative leaders. While waiting patiently in the wings, Kishida has steadily lost political influence and momentum; in recent opinion polls he has slipped below both Koizumi and Ishiba as the LDP politician deemed best suited to take over the top spot. Taro Kono: K\u014dno Tar\u014d belongs to the Shik\u014dkai faction led by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance As\u014d Tar\u014d, a staunch Abe ally. Either K\u014dno and Kat\u014d could emerge as a strong candidate if anointed as Abe\u2019s preferred successor, but neither has the power base needed to win a party election without the Abe camp\u2019s whole-hearted support. Yoshihide Suga: Finally, 69-year-old Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga Yoshihide (eighth-term lower house member) has attracted growing interest as a possible contender\u2014despite repeated denials by Suga himself. Born on a farm in Akita Prefecture, Suga worked his way through H\u014dsei University in Tokyo, worked as a secretary to a Diet member and a cabinet minister, and served in the Yokohama City Council before winning election to the Diet in 1996. A master of crisis management and policy negotiations, he mentors a group of about 40 young Diet politicians. Although Suga has consistently ruled out a bid for the top LDP post, the pundits are not prepared to count him out just yet. Someone else / Long-shots.\n- (Koizumi \"His father is former Prime Minister\" Shinjir\u014d): 37-year-old Koizumi Shinjir\u014d, a mere stripling by traditional LDP standards. Koizumi is a House of Representatives member in his fourth term, with no cabinet experience and no faction behind him. Yet in recent opinion polls, respondents have placed him up alongside former LDP Secretary General Ishiba Shigeru as the most suitable successor to Abe as prime minister.What Koizumi lacks in seniority, some might argue, he makes up for in pedigree. His father is former Prime Minister Koizumi Jun'ichir\u014d, who remained in office more than five and a half years (2001\u20136), thanks to an unusually high public approval rating. His grandfather, Koizumi Jun\u2019ya, served as director general of the Japan Defense Agency in the 1960s, and his great grandfather, Koizumi Matajir\u014d, was a communications minister (known for his colorful speeches and dragon tattoo) before World War II. In this sense, Koizumi certainly fits the profile of a \u201chereditary\u201d LDP politician. But more than his background, it is his mediagenic good looks, public-speaking skills, and memorable sound bites that have propelled him into the national spotlight at so young an age.This is not to suggest that the young Koizumi lacks substance. As director of the agriculture division of the LDP Policy Research Council, he has helped spearhead bold reforms, including measures to curtail the influence of the Japan Agriculture Group over the farming industry and government policy. As de facto leader of a group of young LDP lawmakers dedicated to social security reform and fiscal rehabilitation, he has called for free daycare and early-childhood education through a system of \u201cchildren\u2019s insurance,\u201d paid for by contributions from employers and workers. - (Kat\u014d Katsunobu): Kat\u014d is more aptly viewed as a member of Abe\u2019s inner circle. A close confidant and longtime supporter, he remained steadfastly loyal even after Abe stepped down as prime minister in 2007. After Abe led the LDP back to power in 2012, Kat\u014d was awarded a succession of cabinet posts\u2014deputy chief cabinet secretary, minister for promoting dynamic engagement of all citizens, and minister of health, labor, and welfare\u2014before being appointed chair of the LDP General Council.  - Noda Seiko: Another candidate who defies LDP stereotypes is 58-year-old Noda Seiko (ninth-term lower house member), former chair of the LDP General Council. Appointed minister of posts and telecommunications at the young age of 37, she is often mentioned as a likely candidate to become Japan\u2019s first woman prime minister. She has previously steered clear of factional politics, but her lack of a strong base within the LDP doomed her previous two bids for the party\u2019s top post. In 2015 and again in 2018, she announced plans to challenge Abe, arguing the need for open debate on the issues, but on both occasions she was forced to abandon her long-shot bid after failing to win the required endorsement of 20 LDP Diet members. Chastened by experience, she has since set about building a faction of her own ***\nMy own comments:\n- Aso: It strikes me as somewhat unlikely that he will be prime minister a second time. Isn't liked by my Japanese friends.\n- Ishiba: I thought that being against Article 9 was a big no-no.\n- Kishida: Used to be powerful\n- Kono: Possible successor.\n- Suga: Isn't bidding. \n- Others: Seem long-shots.
