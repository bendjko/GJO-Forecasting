One of them mentions that he is hoping things can return to a fuller reopening over the summer and into fall. In accordance with the planning fallacy, and averaging that general statement, we can assume July 1 is too soon. Another skepticism I have is the crowd's overconfidence in the question about <50,000 COVID cases over a 7 consecutive day period by a certain time this year. The consensus started quite high but has trended to low, where I have been on that question for some time. This tells me the crowd may be too optimistic in having life return to normal, especially by summer as it relates to this question. Side note: @smingers brings up a good point about residual reluctance to reopen despite being vaccinated. The strains are a big factor in this reluctance and the mayor and governor both agree to this perspective. I do not think restaurants will require proof of vaccination or proof of negative COVID test. However, the general trend for COVID in NYC has been quite good, coupled with the higher consensus of users with good brier scores compared to the GJO crowd consensus.

The evidence for making time is the ~40 day time period between 25% reopening around Valentine's Day to 50% capacity in late March. The evidence for the fourth wave is there but not particularly for NYC, where the cases remained flatlined. My forecast probability will be just above the crowd consensus. There is a chance that reopening will include those who are vaccinated. A new order may allow restaurants 85% reopening capacity but only for those vaccinated. However, I cannot see all restaurants adhering to \"only open to vaccinated population\" as this may cause an uproar. Perhaps if the next mandate comes before July, it would be another +25% to reach 75% capacity, but that is still not enough. But if you continue the trend, it would probably reach 100% opening by  July. Though is the COVID trend in early to mid March the same as the current trend? On the other hand, a user mentioned there will be less need for indoor dining during the summer months, which supports my point about restaurants investing lots of money to build outdoor dining extensions.

The likely approach is to go to 75% capacity next (based on my personal experience in my home community), but not for several weeks. Then they will want to stay at that level for some time before lifting restrictions further. Therefore, I don't think the timeline allows the question to resolves to yes.  In an effort to avoid confirmation bias, it's helpful to ask how this question could resolve in the affirmative. The most likely path would be for a more aggressive vaccination schedule leading to herd immunity in June. That would require roughly 8 million vaccines in the next 10 weeks, which is over 10x the current rate. Alternatively, there could be hidden immunity in the population already which could slow down transmission rates to a level at which the government relaxes mandates. Again, the timing for this question makes that difficult as transmission rates are currently high and three months isn't a lot of time.  The easiest way for me to be wrong is for the city to jump to 85% on the next step. However, there is no plan to phase indoor dining from 50% to 100% (I'd be surprised if they jump straight to 100% though).

Again, I think this question is really asking whether restaurants will be open for indoor dining at 100% capacity before July 1. On the one hand, the virus is currently spreading rapidly, and variants are around. On the other hand, immunity levels are also increasing rapidly, summer is around the corner, and it's going to be hard politically to defend restrictions when everyone who wants to be is vaccinated. On the third hand (ahem), Cuomo is under a lot of pressure politically, and the ultimate decision rests with him. But cases are currently so high and increasing so fast that I'm going to revise my forecast down drastically. I don't think they're going to be able to slow cases down fast enough to get to 100% capacity with indoor dining at 50% capacity as it is now. A lot of people are still unvaccinated and not immune, especially with respect to a number of the variants. ***** The science supports keeping restaurants at limited to no indoor capacity while the virus continues to spread at high levels. If the virus is spreading at high levels, then indoor dining at 100% capacity will help to keep spread at high levels, primarily among the unvaccinated, which includes all children, but also among the vaccinated. This will result in severe disease and death, including among the vaccinated, albeit at much reduced levels. Spread of the virus needs to be kept in check. For one thing, the vaccines aren't perfect: data so far suggests that the Pfizer/Moderna vaccines give ~90% protection from severe disease, and the jury is still out for deaths (0 deaths in a vaccinated group vs. ~5 in an unvaccinated group are not a basis for reliable or precise statistics), but that will probably also come in at around 90%, too. What does a 90% reduced risk of severe disease mean? It means that when a group of vaccinated people was compared with a matched group that wasn't vaccinated, 90% fewer people in the vaccinated group got severe disease than in the unvaccinated group. It doesn't mean a vaccinated person has a 10% chance of getting severely sick if they get sick. It doesn't mean that his or her chance of getting severely sick is cut by 90% if he or she gets sick, either. And it certainly doesn't mean that his or her chance of getting severely sick won't go up if he or she engages in more risky behavior than before. In short, someone who is vaccinated has a much reduced chance of getting sick, getting seriously sick, or dying, but that risk is about 10% of what it was before only if their behavior doesn't change, and it's NOT ZERO. More risky behavior will mean more serious disease and death. In other words, if people who were being careful before get vaccinated and then go out and engage in risky behaviors, such as eating indoors at restaurants, they will bring the benefits of vaccination down a serious notch. We might end up with effectively 80% or 70% protection vs. unvaccinated groups if people go out and do risky things. On top of that, there are the variants. Some are more transmissible, some are partial immune escape variants that partially escape vaccine protection, and some are both. The NYC variant is primarily an immune escape variant; B.1.1.7 is more transmissible (and more lethal). How will those play out if lots of vaccinated people dine indoors in restaurants, which is known to be a high risk factor for infection? In at least some places, half the new cases have been in people who ate indoors in restaurants. Thus, with the combination of a large percentage of people not getting vaccinated, and many of the remainder believing that they are now invulnerable to severe disease or death from Covid, indoor dining at restaurants would facilitate virus transmission. If the number of cases per day is high, then opening restaurants at 100% will help to keep it high, and some percentage of vaccinated people will become seriously ill and die, as well. Moreover, kids aren't vaccinated yet. Many appear to dismiss the possibility of severe disease in kids, but it does occur at low rates. It will occur at slightly higher rates with B.1.1.7 and other variants. Some choose to dismiss these risks, while others don't. In addition, well over 10% of people who have had SARSCoV2 infections, kids and adults, young and old, with asymptomatic, mild, moderate and severe cases, are developing long Covid. It is not a trivial consideration. The greater the spread, the greater number of long Covid cases and resulting disability, for some perhaps permanently. Finally, the more spread there is, the greater the opportunity for new variants to arise. NYC has already seen the emergence of one new variant. How many more are just getting started or will emerge if virus spread is allowed to continue at high levels? To summarize:\n1. Vaccines don't offer perfect protection.\n2. If restaurants are opened to 100% capacity, they will facilitate the spread of Covid.\n3. If SARSCoV2 is circulating at high levels, then indoor dining will help to keep those levels high, and some percentage of vaccinated people will become severely ill or die.\n4. When case numbers per day are high, the whole population is at risk, including children.\n5. Long Covid is an important consequence of SARSCoV2 infection that is not rare.\n6. Greater levels of virus spread mean greater opportunities for the spread of existing variants and the emergence of new variants. ****** But science, perceptions of science, and politics are all at play here. What will win? Most of the public does not appear to understand that getting vaccinated does not guarantee that they won't get severely sick or die, others accept the risks after vaccination, yet others dismiss the risks associated with Covid itself, and many dismiss the additional consequences of spread to kids, long Covid and the rise of variants. Some portions of these groups of people will likely push for restrictions to be lifted on all kinds of risky activities. But the bottom line is that I don't think restaurants will be opened to 100% capacity so long as the virus is circulating at high levels, and I don't foresee the number of cases/day being brought to low enough levels for quite some time. Communities in the US have shown a preference for allowing spread within a certain range, and for balancing levels of spread and death with restrictions, rather than eliminating both spread and restrictions, as has been accomplished in places such as New Zealand. The virus is currently being allowed to circulate at high and rapidly rising levels in NYC. At some point, additional control measures may need to be put in place to slow spread. Even high vaccination rates may not be enough to slow the spread of B.1.1.7, especially among the unvaccinated, and severe disease and deaths will still occur at reduced but substantial levels. So, even if many in the public don't understand the science, and even if the political pressure to open up restaurants gets even greater, I don't think there will be much choice but to keep restaurants below 100% capacity over the time frame of this forecast. ********* Update 4/17: \"\u201cWe talked about adjusting the valve between economic activity and economic constraint, depending on how we\u2019re doing with COVID, we\u2019re going to extend the 11 p.m. curfew for food and beverage to midnight, that will go into effect, Monday, April 19 for catered events,\u201d Cuomo said Wednesday afternoon. \u201cThe disease is still very much with us, you see it escalating in some states, you see it escalating in some countries.

Currently vaccinating at rate of ~375k doses/week. Say, ~1.5M doses/month. More mass vaccination sites are opening soon. NYC population ~8.4M. Most doses will be of Pfizer/Moderna.

Cuomo stop trying to control spread after most people are at least partially vaccinated? The need to prevent healthcare systems from being overwhelmed, and people from dying and getting long Covid, remains. But, cases are increasing now, and he still just opened restaurants up to 50% capacity.  Another aspect to consider about this question is that it asks whether restaurants will be allowed to be open at \"85% capacity or more\". Who opens at \"85% capacity\"? Or 90%? Or 95%? You're either going to be at 25%/35%, or 50%, or maybe 65%/75%, or 100%. Nobody is going to be splitting hairs that small. I can't imagine they'd even go to 65%/75% before 100%.
