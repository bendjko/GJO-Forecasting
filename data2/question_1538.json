This prediction change is a result of the domino effect of candidates dropping out and throwing their support behind Joe Biden rather than Bernie Sanders, as well as huge wins for Biden in the South that revived his campaign during Super Tuesday. The double digit margin in votes between Biden and Sanders that secured Biden's victory last night (March 17th, 2020) in the Arizona, Florida, and Illinois primaries seems but signal the end of any possibility  for Sanders to secure a national coalition of supporters. The remaining 2% of chance of the candidate not being chosen on the first ballot is accounting for a possible sudden failing in the eyes of Dem. voters for Biden to prove he is the only one who can defeat Trump ie. a health issue or major scandal."], [66626, "2020-03-18T21:15:32Z", [0.99], ""], [67414, "2020-03-18T19:52:25Z", [1.0], ""], [28153, "2020-03-18T16:24:10Z", [1.0], ""], [34353, "2020-03-18T15:22:10Z", [1.0], ""], [84645, "2020-03-18T13:59:03Z", [1.0], ""], [84791, "2020-03-18T12:38:06Z", [0.97], ""], [691, "2020-03-18T12:28:55Z", [1.0], ""], [40848, "2020-03-18T11:50:46Z", [0.99], ""], [85274, "2020-03-18T08:12:24Z", [1.0], ""], [85937, "2020-03-18T06:13:58Z", [0.95], ""], [85774, "2020-03-18T03:39:10Z", [1.0], ""], [86233, "2020-03-18T01:56:42Z", [1.0], ""], [16778, "2020-03-18T01:31:58Z", [1.0], ""], [63963, "2020-03-17T20:16:29Z", [1.0], ""], [85416, "2020-03-17T16:31:42Z", [0.9], ""], [77404, "2020-03-17T14:59:52Z", [1.0], ""], [2965, "2020-03-17T14:10:06Z", [1.0], ""], [57778, "2020-03-17T07:02:10Z", [0.97], ""], [79192, "2020-03-17T01:31:30Z", [0.98], ""], [26666, "2020-03-16T21:46:02Z", [0.98], ""], [35646, "2020-03-16T20:28:35Z", [0.93], ""], [745, "2020-03-16T20:15:33Z", [0.99], ""], [45594, "2020-03-16T18:16:12Z", [0.7], ""], [66012, "2020-03-16T17:48:25Z", [0.9], ""], [80764, "2020-03-16T15:54:27Z", [1.0], ""], [484, "2020-03-16T15:18:16Z", [1.0], "Up 5% considering how things appear to be heading."], [31275, "2020-03-16T13:53:38Z", [0.96], ""], [85199, "2020-03-16T08:18:33Z", [0.99], ""], [534, "2020-03-15T19:14:39Z", [0.96], ""], [65831, "2020-03-15T17:52:04Z", [0.99], "Fear of change."], [16933, "2020-03-15T15:53:10Z", [0.99], ""], [72737, "2020-03-15T14:28:37Z", [1.0], ""], [82010, "2020-03-15T13:28:59Z", [0.95], ""], [172, "2020-03-15T11:33:19Z", [1.0], ""], [56, "2020-03-15T03:01:01Z", [1.0], ""], [35646, "2020-03-15T02:38:35Z", [0.88], ""], [35646, "2020-03-15T02:38:21Z", [0.12], "Comment deleted on Mar 15, 2020 02:38AM UTC"], [45594, "2020-03-15T01:00:37Z", [0.7], ""], [86246, "2020-03-15T00:48:47Z", [1.0], "The days of the party convention deciding the candidate are long gone.

(I'm not entirely sure about this one). From an outside perspective, brokered conventions have never occurred in modern politics. The most recent brokered convention was in 1952.  The key to avoiding a brokered convention is candidates dropping out of the race; that frees up voters to switch to the leading candidates and allows the leading candidates to gain a majority of the delegates. My answer to this question is very contingent on candidates dropping out. I think that candidates haven't dropped out like normal for a variety of reasons (Iowa kerfuffle and the success of Klobuchar in NH). I think Nevada may bring some clarity and I anticipate candidates dropping out after Super Tuesday if it doesn't go their way. However, the longer candidates stick around the more likely they want to say because a brokered convention becomes more likely. So, I will be carefully monitoring candidates and whether they will drop out to answer this question. Right now I'm going with the outside view because of how little information we have on these candidates actual success in elections.
