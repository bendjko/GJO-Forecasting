From 29 December\n2020 (2.6 million cases) to yesterday (3.9 million cases), there has been an increase of approximately 1.3 \nmillion cases over 9 weeks, which averages to around 145,000 per week.

According to Time Magazine, Africa may have unique factors that contribute to the decrease in reported \nnumbers of cases. These include an average age of 19 years old and an overall smaller population of \npeople over the age of 50 when compared with other countries. As COVID seems to affect older\npopulations more than younger, this would indicate lower rates of infection will continue. \u201cThe fact that \ndiabetes, obesity and hypertension, some of the comorbidities that appear to make COVID-19 more \ndeadly, are also less common among the continent\u2019s population than they are in other parts of the\nworld\u201d also accounts for a projected decline in the number of reported cases (Baker).

There would need to be 1.1 million new cases in the next 25 days for the total confirmed cases to reach over 5 million. With the vaccine rollout, I do not believe that the number of new cases will reach 1.1 million.

This number alone means there is a 0% chance that fewer than 2.5 million cases could be reported.  1,051,972 more cases would need to be reported to cross the 5.0 million, inclusive, threshold, and with only 24 days left until the April 1, 2021 deadline, it is not improbable, but highly unlikely. So, I have predicted a 2% chance of cases reported being more than 5.0 million but fewer than 10.0 million.  \u201cThere are wide variations in testing rates and while some countries have reduced testing, others have maintained or even increased it at different points during the pandemic\u201d (Mwai 2021).  The lack of a consistent rate of testing across the continent means that cases which are still to be reported are only going to come out of large countries that have increased testing, such as South Africa.  \u201cFor Epi week 8 (22 - 28 February 2021), 67,608 new COVID-19 cases have been reported, which is a 10% decrease in the number of new cases reported compared to Epi week 7\u201d (Africa CDC).  To reach 1,051,972 new reported cases in 24 days, 43,832 cases would have to be reported daily.  The rate of reporting appears to be around 9,660 cases daily. This leads me to predict that cases reported will not rise above 5.0 million inclusive by April 1, 2021, so I am predicting a 98% chance that the number will remain between 2.5 million and 5.0 million.

Especially the factor of the spread among the population. Since there are 3,887,893 cases reported on February 27th and 3.5 million of those came from the 9 months' worth of numbers above, it's difficult to make a prediction.\u00a0 So I broke it down more to recent numbers on a weekly basis.\u00a0 Dec 26- 2644767\nDifference 163685\nJan 2- 2808452\nDifference 213066\nJan 9- 3021518\n213650\nJan 16- 3235168\nDifference 182350\nJan 23- 3417518\nDifference 136347\nJan 30- 3553865\nDifference 104672\nFeb 6- 3658537\nDifference 84312\nFeb 13- 3742849\nDifference 77033\nFeb 20- 3819882\nDifference 68011\nFeb 27- 3887893 Over the ten weeks, it works out to 142312.6 average. This number also isn't fair because of one very big factor, holidays. True to form, every time there is a holiday or big event, there's a large spike in coronavirus numbers two weeks after. In the US after any long weekend, i.e. memorial day, two weeks after there was a spike in cases. The same holds true for Africa but in this case, it was most likely due to the New Years' celebration. I looked into March and since there aren't many holidays, and I just have a hunch that Africa doesn't celebrate St. Patrick's Day as much as the rest of the world I'm going to go with a slightly less of a number of cases as seen by the decline between the end of January and now.\u00a0I started looking into other holidays as well: \n-International Women's Day (probably not going to be a gathering celebration)\n-The Prophet's Ascension (March 11th), celebrated in Somalia, but Somalia only has 8k reported cases, however, over the last month they've doubled their number of cases. So I'm going to factor that in as well and give them a double factor of 8k more over the next month and add that.\n-Commemoration of the Victory over Gaddafi (March 19th)- Libya. At the end of this month, Libya should be around 150-155k cases based on their steady trend over the last 3 months. I'm going to add an additional 10%(just a guess) spike to that number and add 15k additional for Libya.\n-Independence Day (March 20th)- Tunisia. 237k cases right now and most likely around 250k at the end of the month. I'll also add an arbitrary 10% to that number for the independence day celebration. 25k more for Tunisia. Since that puts the date around the 20th of March, I'm going to predict that the difference of less than two weeks will fall into my prediction below.  Those factors considered I'm going to estimate somewhere between 55,000-63,000 per week.\u00a0 Given the number on February 27th, 2021 was 3,887,893, that should put the numbers around: March 6th- 3,942,893-3,950,893\nMarch 13th- 3,997,893-4,013,893\nMarch 20th-4,052,893-4,076,893\nMarch 27th-4,107,893-4,139,893\nApril 1st-\u00a0 4,162,893-4,202,893\nHolidays addition- 8k/15k/25k\nRough estimate- 4,212,893-4252,893 I find it highly unlikely based on the previously reported numbers that there will be 1.2 million more in the entire month.  https://africacenter.org/spotlight/coronavirus-spreads-through-africa/\nhttps://www.qppstudio.net/public-holidays-by-date/march-19.htm\nhttps://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/somalia/\nhttps://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus////country/libya/\nhttps://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/tunisia/"], [691, "2021-03-07T15:00:24Z", [0.0, 0.99, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [27661, "2021-03-07T10:32:07Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [99144, "2021-03-07T04:48:58Z", [0.0, 0.75, 0.2, 0.04, 0.01], "As of March 5, 2021, the total cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in Africa is 3,948,029 cases (Africa CDC, 2021).

To get my estimate for April 1st, 2021, I calculated the number of weekly cases over the last month, and the number of monthly cases over the last 8 months.

Taking averages of these numbers over the last 8 months, you get an increase of roughly 434,000 cases per month. On the recent high end, there\u2019s an average increase of roughly 188,000 cases per week (taken beginning of December - beginning of January). On the recent low end, there\u2019s an average increase of roughly 140,000 cases per week (taken beginning of January - beginning of March) With a low weekly prediction, Africa would land at about 4.5 million cumulative COVID-19 cases on 04/01/2021. With a high weekly prediction, it would be at about 4.7 million cases. Based on monthly averages, Africa CDC would report about 4.4 million cases as of 04/01/2021. Because it is not 100% impossible for Africa CDC to report more than 20.0 million cases (as compared to reporting fewer than 2.5 million cases), I am therefore giving 1% probability to that statistic. Between 10.0 million and 20.0 million, inclusive, is a bit more probable, but still incredibly unlikely, so I am therefore giving it 4%. Africa CDC. (2021).

Given the first patient reported with COVID-19 in Africa was in Egypt on 14FEBUARY2021 (Al Jazeera, 2020), I divided the total number of reported cases by 12.5 adjusting for the months COVID-19 has been in Africa.

Since the first case of coronavirus in Africa was declared on 14 February 2020, this indicates an infection rate of approximately 311,791.2 people per month (total cases divided by 12.5 months).  Furthermore, with 317,628 active cases on the continent (total cases minus recoveries and deaths) each infected person would have to spread the virus to approximately 3.5 other people to infect an additional 1,102,610 within the next 31 days, thus breaking the \u201c5 million\u201d threshold to the next category.  Africa appears to have had two peaks in daily infections; one around 23 July 2020 with 19,612 new cases and one around 9 January 2021 with 36,173 new cases, but the current seven-day average appears to be between 10,000 and 10,150.  This rate does not show a significant difference from the average monthly infection rate, however, another spike similar to or greater than the one seen in January 2021 may provide a large enough deviation to surpass 5 million cases.  Since the January 2021 spike was slow growing over several months and the rate of infection is currently on a decline, it is unlikely that it would occur with enough speed to reach this number within the next 31 days.  Based on this information, I assess there is a 2% chance the number of cases could reach 5 million by 1 April 2021, and it is a certainty that it will not exceed 10 million cases within the same amount of time.

A rise in cases was spotted in November, by mid December they were hitting 10K cases per day, then 14K cases and ended the New Year with 18K cases. This increase is most likely from what might be termed a Holiday surge, lots of super spreader events, parties and ppl generally letting their guard down and the 501v.2 variant\n\nThey imposed tougher lock down restrictions on the 28th of December, there is also a concern that the 501v.2 variant will worsen the situation, although there seems to be some evidence that this may not be the case. The Eastern Cape were the 501v.2 broke out hit a daily high of 19K active cases, it has since gone down to just below 5K active cases and then up to 7323 with the holiday surge. The Western Cape and KZN have also shown step rises in the number of active cases (42K and 55K respectively) but despite the holiday surge their numbers have not seen a dramatic increase.  With the effect of the lock down restrictions expected to kick in soon cases numbers should start to decline, which means the total daily figures for Africa will go down as well. While this has not happened with lineage B.1.1.7  in the UK it may well be down to two factors, firstly 501v.2 is not as infectious and also it is summer in the Southern hemisphere\n\nCases in Egypt has seen a rise over the last few weeks, but they and a few other African countries will be implementing a vaccine program. South Africa may only start on a vaccine program by April, although they could locally manufacture the AZ Oxford Vax earlier. Either way with only 90 days to go I do not think this will have much effect on the outcome of this question Cases are increasing as a whole in a number of countries , it is not clear yet that the 501v.2 or another variant like lineage B.1.1.7  will cause volumes to increase substantially, but is a possibility that cannot be discounted Nigeria has seen a small increase in cases for the month of December, but on the whole have remained stable"], [94301, "2021-01-02T12:43:26Z", [0.0, 0.9, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [28153, "2021-01-02T11:09:05Z", [0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [94872, "2021-01-02T02:21:39Z", [0.0, 0.45, 0.55, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [57778, "2021-01-02T01:41:49Z", [0.0, 0.25, 0.71, 0.04, 0.0], ""], [80790, "2021-01-01T19:02:22Z", [0.0, 0.43, 0.53, 0.04, 0.0], "Current cases at 2.7m.

As of the 21 December Africa CDC recorded 2 526 520 cases over the 265 day period. The question is how many cases can occur within the 100 days that remain\n\nLet us look at the factors, we know that we are dealing with exponential growth, so numbers will be increasing at a faster rate until a break point is hit. An additional factor is the introduction of the 501v variant which is more infectious and has given rise to increasing numbers in South Africa Daily cases for the continent have increased from a average of 8K per day in September, then 9.5 in October, followed by 13.5K in November. December has been a bit a roller coaster, Morocco was coming out of its peak, Tunisia numbers had increased during November and have not gone down a lot, then 501v made SA numbers jump through the roof, so I would rather use a working average of 18.5K for December. One needs to bear in mind that at the start of December Morocco was coming off a average of 4.5K and SA was about 2.2K  -  This has now turned around to were Morocco are about 2.5K and SA up to about 9K and increasing In the short term I would expect Morocco\u2019s figures to drop, while SA figures might continue to rise due to the more infectious 501v variant.  There is however a change that I am seeing in the pattern that makes me wonder if there will be a continuous explosion in numbers.  Last time around the surge started in the Western Cape (WC) followed by the Eastern Cape (EC) then Kwa Zulu Natal (KZN) and onto Gauteng, then the rest of the country / provinces.  This time around there appears to be a difference, it started out in the EC with the 501v variant, then went to the WC and then onto KZN   Now it is currently starting up in Gauteng   There is however something odd going on, while cases were increasing rapidly in the WC and KZN they have started to flatten out in the EC  -  There could be various reasons for this, but it may be part of a trend, so I will be keeping a close watch on both in the near future\n\nWith 2\u00a0473\u00a0480 cases in 100 Days the Maths are fairly simple, it will require a sustained rate of 24.7K cases per day to take us to the next bucket. If we look at the history of the growth in numbers and also the nature of this infection, it would seem quite possible that this figure could be reached. The introduction of a faster spreading variant/s, in this case 501v is indeed a tool that should be used in modelling However\u2026  There remains a few problems, while it seems possible that the numbers could well increase, will they be counted? Can the health care systems in the affected countries cope with the sheer number of cases?  This is something that was spotted when working on the forecast for China earlier this year, were you had Lab test cases, suspected cases and unexplained deaths. The sad truth of the situation is for a lot of these countries there are finite resources and personnel. Studying some of the data I do not think SA could handle more than 200 \u2013 250K active cases for a sustained period of time. The two countries with the highest number of tests have the highest number of cases (SA & Morocco) Out of the 57 countries in Africa only five have done more than a million tests and only seven others have done more than half a million tests  (SA 6M  -  Morocco 4M  -  Ethiopia 1.7M  -  Egypt 1M  -  Kenya  1M) Looking at the difference between the UK and SA it should be noted that it is winter in the UK temperatures are low and they are only getting about 8 hours sunlight per day, in SA it is summer. While people tend to down play the part that weather may play, it might be the one thing that could help.  The News in the UK about the concern of the possible spread of 501v there is in itself very worrying  Nigeria and Egypt have seen an increase in cases but seem stable for now\n\nIn conclusion it seems there is a greater possibility that it may well go over the 5 Million mark by April, what happens in the next three weeks will be critical"], [96450, "2020-12-23T18:52:20Z", [0.0, 0.8, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2020-12-23T14:31:01Z", [0.0, 0.9, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [94872, "2020-12-23T03:34:47Z", [0.0, 0.85, 0.15, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [86678, "2020-12-22T16:52:45Z", [0.0, 0.99, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [79508, "2020-12-21T07:24:56Z", [0.0, 0.85, 0.15, 0.0, 0.0], "First 2.5 Million reached"], [94872, "2020-12-21T02:38:19Z", [0.0, 0.84, 0.16, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [88098, "2020-12-21T01:18:07Z", [0.0, 0.85, 0.15, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [38094, "2020-12-20T18:38:16Z", [0.0, 0.75, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0], "12/19 = 2,490,397....we are now into the second bucket with an elevated chance of going to the third bucket with new strain of the virus reported in South Africa which may change the game going forward."], [92346, "2020-12-20T16:52:44Z", [0.0, 0.8, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [20156, "2020-12-19T08:20:44Z", [0.0, 0.8, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [62808, "2020-12-19T03:48:11Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [84880, "2020-12-19T03:29:37Z", [0.0, 0.93, 0.07, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [79508, "2020-12-18T08:45:40Z", [0.0, 0.86, 0.14, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [57778, "2020-12-17T22:09:50Z", [0.0, 0.81, 0.19, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [79508, "2020-12-17T09:47:16Z", [0.0, 0.87, 0.13, 0.0, 0.0], "Will have next report on  22 December"], [45594, "2020-12-17T09:27:47Z", [0.05, 0.5, 0.2, 0.2, 0.05], ""], [34959, "2020-12-17T05:02:46Z", [0.0, 0.78, 0.22, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [57778, "2020-12-16T22:22:06Z", [0.0, 0.8, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [86554, "2020-12-16T08:06:20Z", [0.0, 0.83, 0.17, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [40584, "2020-12-15T02:16:27Z", [0.0, 0.9, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [57778, "2020-12-14T22:24:31Z", [0.0, 0.78, 0.22, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2020-12-14T21:48:26Z", [0.0, 0.92, 0.08, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [88766, "2020-12-14T14:08:19Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [57778, "2020-12-13T21:47:17Z", [0.0, 0.75, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2020-12-13T15:49:10Z", [0.0, 0.98, 0.02, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [27661, "2020-12-11T17:50:04Z", [0.0, 0.55, 0.43, 0.02, 0.0], ""], [88766, "2020-12-11T17:35:08Z", [0.0, 0.9, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [38094, "2020-12-11T16:55:36Z", [0.0, 0.9, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0], "Still not sure I believe the counts.\n12/10 = 2,323,845"], [34959, "2020-12-11T14:43:00Z", [0.0, 0.85, 0.15, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [79508, "2020-12-11T08:22:45Z", [0.0, 0.88, 0.12, 0.0, 0.0], "Going back to 3 November calculation,  second wave is taking off in SA  -  Morocco and Tunisia are calming down The big worry at the moment is Nigeria, they seem to be on an increasing pattern, they would need to be able to get through the holidays without things geting out of hand.

Two calculations I ran saw the 2.5 Million point would be reached by about 21 December,  This would then leave exactly 100 days to reach the next target of 2.5 Million which would require a sustained rate of 25K cases per day The main drivers of numbers for November were Morocco (137\u00a0252)  South Africa (64\u00a0552) and Tunisia (35\u00a0654) South Africa appears to be increasing with cases and Rt numbers rising in two provinces (Western and Eastern Cape)  They have not reported test numbers for four days, the case to test percentage is useful in seeing if there is a increasing or decreasing trend, for example when Morocco were recording 5K+ cases per day the test to positive rate was 20 \u2013 25% they are now recording less cases and accordingly the rate has gone down to about 17%  -  South Africa had risen from 8% test to case to over 10%  this tied in with the rise in numbers Madagascar with a Population of 28M is the lowest with only 373 cases in November (they like to Move it, move it)\n\nIt would be easy to say that it looks like it will take eight and a half months to reach 2.5 Million and for it to reach another 2.5 Million in three and a half months seems a bit of a tall task, but not impossible, given the nature of the infection.

There seems to be very little in the way of mass testing to find cases, as you have seen in other countries. There are plans afoot to introduce a less costly and quicker testing service, but from a model I have been working on I don't think this will gain much traction...  we shall see    Here are the top fifteen countries in Africa listed in order of the highest number of Total cases, with their daily average of new cases over a ten day period South Africa - Total cases to date 672 572  -  Daily average over the last ten days 1 291\nMorocco - Total cases to date  121\u00a0183 -  Daily average over the last ten days  2 136\nEgypt - Total cases to date 103\u00a0079  -  Daily average over the last ten days  117\nEthiopia - Total cases to date 74\u00a0584 -  Daily average over the last ten days    645\nNigeria - Total cases to date 58\u00a0647 -  Daily average over the last ten days   150\nAlgeria- Total cases to date 51\u00a0368 -  Daily average over the last ten days   174\nGhana - Total cases to date 46\u00a0482  -  Daily average over the last ten days  60\nKenya - Total cases to date 38\u00a0378 -  Daily average over the last ten days  154\nLibya - Total cases to date 34\u00a0014 -  Daily average over the last ten days  678  \nCameroon - Total cases to date 20\u00a0838 -  Daily average over the last ten days  40\nIvory Coast - Total cases to date 19\u00a0669  -  Daily average over the last ten days  40\nTunisia  - Total cases to date  17 405 -  Daily average over the last ten days  1 120\nMadagascar - Total cases to date 16\u00a0377 -  Daily average over the last ten days  35\nSenegal - Total cases to date 14\u00a0945 -  Daily average over the last ten days  25\nZambia - Total cases to date 14\u00a0715 -  Daily average over the last ten days   69 "], [28153, "2020-10-03T11:10:17Z", [0.06, 0.64, 0.3, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [57778, "2020-10-03T02:34:47Z", [0.02, 0.44, 0.5, 0.03, 0.01], ""], [87827, "2020-10-02T16:22:32Z", [0.3, 0.4, 0.25, 0.04, 0.01], "Skewing back down toward 2.5 million, it's looking more likely than the over 5 million option.

I am inclined to go along with the cold theory, being based in Africa I can personally confirm there have been some really bad cases of colds (Not Flu) going around the last few years   Coronavirus in Africa: Overcrowding might explain mystery of low death rate\nAndrew Harding  BBC Africa  03 September 2020 As the number of infections dips sharply in South Africa, and stays relatively low across much of the continent, experts are reaching towards a startling hypothesis. For months health experts have been warning that living conditions in poor, urban communities across Africa are likely to contribute to a rapid spread of coronavirus.  In the early stages of the pandemic, all the experts and all the modelling agreed that Africa was in trouble \"I thought we were heading towards a disaster, a complete meltdown,\" said Professor Shabir Madhi, South Africa's top virologist.  South Africa has still performed impressively well, as have many other parts of the continent, where hospital beds remain stubbornly empty, and where infection graphs have almost entirely avoided the pronounced peaks and sharp angles seen in so many other parts of the world. \"Most African countries don't have a peak. I don't understand why. I'm completely at sea,\" admitted Prof Karim The idea is that, by studying the PBMCs, the scientists might find evidence that people had been widely infected by other coronaviruses - those, for instance, responsible for many common colds - and that, as a result, they might enjoy some degree of immunity to Covid-19. \"I can't think of anything else that would explain the numbers of completely asymptomatic people we're seeing. The numbers are completely unbelievable,\" he said, savouring the irony of the possibility that Africa's entrenched poverty might \"for once\" work in the continent's favour. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-53998374"], [38094, "2020-09-11T03:23:19Z", [0.05, 0.95, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "9/9 = 1,322,452\nAug 11 there were 1,066,505 cases reported by Africa CDC\nFor a daily rate of 255,947 divided by 29 days =8,825 with 203 days left in the period yields 1,791,475 additional cases beyond the reported 1,322,452 for a total of about 3,113,927 at the end of the period."], [57778, "2020-09-11T01:01:47Z", [0.02, 0.49, 0.43, 0.04, 0.02], ""], [31275, "2020-09-10T19:41:38Z", [0.1, 0.6, 0.2, 0.08, 0.02], ""], [95669, "2020-09-10T12:27:49Z", [0.08, 0.3, 0.42, 0.18, 0.02], ""], [13306, "2020-09-10T07:38:18Z", [0.03, 0.6, 0.35, 0.02, 0.0], ""], [57778, "2020-09-09T22:19:08Z", [0.04, 0.39, 0.45, 0.09, 0.03], ""], [79508, "2020-09-09T21:47:56Z", [0.12, 0.88, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [88766, "2020-09-09T09:44:11Z", [0.1, 0.9, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [87064, "2020-09-09T09:08:14Z", [0.2, 0.8, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [19127, "2020-09-09T08:49:16Z", [0.05, 0.49, 0.28, 0.1, 0.08], ""], [38094, "2020-09-08T22:20:47Z", [0.05, 0.95, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "9/7 = 1,307,444\nAug 11 there were 1,066,505 cases reported by Africa CDC\nFor a daily rate of 240,939 divided by 27 days =8,923 with 205 days left in the period yields 1,829,351 additional cases beyond the reported 1,284,748 for a total of about 3,136,795 at the end of the period.\nAssume linearity as there are numerous clusters all on different trajectories and time scales and reporting methodoligies.

The combination of low testing capacity and the possibility that many cases have already been missed by testing leads me to believe there's a possibility that the outbreak in Africa is either flat or trending down overall as opposed to trending up, or at least approaching the peak faster than I previously expected. https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/08/pandemic-appears-have-spared-africa-so-far-scientists-are-struggling-explain-why\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-53181555"], [34959, "2020-08-18T05:22:10Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.49, 0.27, 0.09], ""], [88743, "2020-08-17T13:56:10Z", [0.01, 0.07, 0.35, 0.52, 0.05], ""], [40584, "2020-08-17T12:50:31Z", [0.25, 0.6, 0.15, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [79508, "2020-08-17T12:18:08Z", [0.2, 0.77, 0.02, 0.01, 0.0], ""], [8318, "2020-08-17T05:24:04Z", [0.88, 0.12, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [57778, "2020-08-17T00:37:40Z", [0.02, 0.25, 0.56, 0.14, 0.03], ""], [87427, "2020-08-16T22:39:58Z", [0.08, 0.17, 0.5, 0.25, 0.0], ""], [93118, "2020-08-16T21:34:06Z", [0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [88766, "2020-08-16T11:03:41Z", [0.38, 0.62, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [45594, "2020-08-16T07:41:54Z", [0.05, 0.2, 0.5, 0.2, 0.05], ""], [38094, "2020-08-16T04:31:39Z", [0.35, 0.6, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0], "Africa has been a statistical mystery to those following the numbers.

So far, around 1% of the population of South Africa have had Covid-19. Daily cases have been falling, but I am assuming an average of 7k/day until April for argument's sake.

This difference may be of some importance as it could well affect the outcome of this forecast In a nutshell you might well have a situation were all the cases are not going to be reported, the epidemic will have run its course and the only clues you may have could be the number of excess deaths. Let us look at what has transpired over the last twenty days 20 days ago: Please note this is sum total of figures from the start of the outbreak Nigeria (the most populous country in Africa) with a population over three times that of South Africa and who reported their first CV19 case before SA currently have reported 29 789 cases and 503 deaths (WHO SR-170)  South Africa which had a strict lockdown and currently still has a tobacco ban in place has reported 215 855 cases and 3 502 deaths - Which is currently just under half the total number of cases reported for Africa and is rising at about 9K daily Currently:\nNigeria have reported a total of 41 180 cases and 860 deaths (WHO SR-190)  an increase of just 11\u00a0391 cases and 367 deaths South Africa in the same period have reported 452 530 cases and 7 067 deaths  an increase of  236\u00a0675 cases and 3\u00a0565 deaths While the increases show a 37% and 50%  in numbers respectively, it is the base numbers that are more concerning, basically a tenth  -  SA currently have a tobacco and Alcohol ban in place, Nigeria are going to implement some restrictions on Alcohol due to rising numbers (closing Bars)"], [88452, "2020-07-30T09:31:14Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.6, 0.4, 0.0], ""], [57778, "2020-07-30T03:22:43Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.55, 0.25, 0.05], ""], [93, "2020-07-30T02:55:52Z", [0.0, 0.25, 0.45, 0.25, 0.05], ""], [93358, "2020-07-29T21:58:54Z", [0.0, 0.3, 0.45, 0.25, 0.0], ""], [93358, "2020-07-29T21:28:29Z", [0.0, 0.3, 0.45, 0.25, 0.0], ""], [94646, "2020-07-29T16:37:35Z", [0.09, 0.25, 0.4, 0.21, 0.05], "About half of the positive tests are from South Africa, which continues to struggle.

The virus has not behaved consistently from country to country or even regions within a country.\n2. So there is very little to extrapolate from as of June 2020. One has to base any early assumptions (july 2020) on understanding conditions that might affect the spread in Africa and its different regions.\n3. While spread in Africans in general may not be enhanced by the factors seen in the west, like: preexisting conditions such as obesity, hyper tension etc. Instead in Africa it will be effected dispropotionatly by malnutrition, urban slums, lack of basic hygiene in large parts of the population, extreme density and lack of ability to quarantine in many of the cities, and the lack of adequate ICU units in even major city will be contributing factors across most of the continent. \n4. Africa has managed to keep it numbers down by an early shut down that most African countries adopted and the stop in tourism also helped to keep the virus count down..\n5. African countries can not simply remain lockdown for much longer and starve its population. Plus it lacks the resources for the govt to feed them with a locked down economy, for more than a few months. \n6. Fall and Winter is the peak tourism period, as some countries open up for tourism esp from china and EU where the numbers are low right now, the numbers in Africa will pick up fast.\n7. Therefore once the lockdowns in these countries are lifted, which they have to be lifted in a couple of months to literally survive, the factors that make Africa vulnerable will be exposed.\n8. With a population of 1.2 Billion even a 2% would be around 22 million. The US with all its resources is expected to exceed 1% by Fall.. \n9. The final factor to consider is. In the absence of the ability to conduct large scale testing of even the dead. What assumptions will the African CDC use to calculate the number of cases across such a vastly varied continent, where basic testing is a luxury ? \n10. Based on how off they have been with their early assumptions with countries like India and Brazil which showed no early signs of contagion but have since exponentially gone up, CDC will take those two factors into account an err on the side of a grossly conservative high estimate. \n11. They will err on the side of a high estimate, also to keep the African countries from opening up too early unless there is a treatment or vaccine by then, which is a extremely low probability based on the history of vaccines.\n12. What that tells me is that the total number of cases being higher than 2% of the population is extremely likely.

I think environmental/living factors (household sizes, interconnectedness between population hubs, population density, etc.) are more important than the wealth/resources of African countries. African has very capable public health systems, and clearly a country's GDP is not very reflective of their ability to control Covid-19. I expect Africa may fare better than other continents: sparser, hotter, familiar with novel infections, distributed community-based healthcare, and by being late they have more knowledge of how the spread of this infection can be stopped/slowed (it doesn't seem like any country has actually learnt anything from other countries' failures, though). With this in mind, I have favoured lower numbers. The fact that Africa is later than others is probably because it is less connected with the rest of the world, but may also be due to the virus' inability to spread as well here. The WHO predicts 250 million people will catch it over the first year of the pandemic. When I looked into this in March for European countries, the unconfirmed cases were between 10 and 300 times larger than the number of confirmed cases, which isn't particularly helpful! I'll place 5% on >25 million confirmed cases with this information, though. Looking at the virus from a continental perspective is super interesting, Europe's trajectory is markedly different to the others (it looks logistic while the others look exponential still). When looking at confirmed cases as a proportion of population, Africa is where Asia was a month ago (which is seeing a doubling time of 70 days, but isn't a helpful comparison). The same comparison method would suggest Africa is where Europe was on March 26th (267,000 confirmed cases), whose case numbers have grown by nearly an order of magnitude in 3 months. Obviously, numbers are still growing, but I'm going to naively assume there will be a 10x growth (like Europe experienced) in the next few months as a minimum. That gives >4 million cases. Same comparison has South America in this position by April 29th. South America is probably more comparable to Africa than any other continent, and they've had case numbers grow 15x in just 2 months! And things are still getting rapidly worse. I'm going to take 20x current case numbers as the median for Africa, and will update as I see how South America progresses (I think things will turn out worse there than they do in Africa, though). 80% confidence interval = [4 mil, 8 mil, 18 mil] [Africa is a young continent and, while there may be confounding factors that reduce their resilience to the virus, I expect the mortality rate to be lower here than in the UK, for example.
