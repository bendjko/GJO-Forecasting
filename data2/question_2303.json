And another acquaintance just became a new pilot for United. All anecdotal, of course, but when I look at news articles, too, I expect today to be at least within 30k of 2.4M, even if it doesn't make it.

I crunched the numbers for the last couple of weekends, comparing Friday counts to Sunday counts. The weekend of May 6&8 (Mother's Day), Sunday's count was 98.6% of Friday's. \u00a0If that is the case this weekend, then today's count will be about 2,363,772. The weekend of May 13&15, Sunday's count was 1.018% of Friday's. \u00a0If that is the case this weekend, then today's count will be about 2,388,864. For Sunday's count to exceed 2.4m, it would need to be 1.0227% of Friday's. \u00a0 Saturday's count was very low, but I'm guessing that a lot of travelers this weekend are going to graduations which would be held on Saturday, so may be flying home today. Looking back since the beginning of the year, the Sunday count has exceeded the Friday count by more than 1.0227% six times (out of 18). \u00a0So, that would mean there was a 33% chance it might do so this weekend. HOWEVER, given the pilot shortage and that next weekend is Memorial Day weekend, I'm guessing that the airlines are running lean schedules this weekend, \"saving\" pilots for a \"fatter\" schedule next weekend. \u00a0So, am going to reduce my forecast to 30%.

Except around Easter, Fridays have averaged 2.5% greater than the day before, range 0.6%-4.6%. The most recent Friday was 2.0% higher than the day before. So I'll expect Friday's number to be between 2.342M and 2.435, probably closer to the expected average 2.5% higher number, 2.386M or just below. So I give Friday a ~48% chance of exceeding 2.4M, if we say that this week's numbers are likely to end up averaging ~89.5% of 2019 numbers, or a ~36% chance based on the typical pattern of Fridays vs. Thursdays. I give Sunday a ~50% chance of exceeding 2.4M, if we say that this week's numbers are likely to end up averaging ~89.5% of 2019 numbers, or looking at the ratios of Sundays to the Thursdays before, I get a ~40% chance that this coming Sunday will see 2.4M or more. If we average it all out to ~40% chance that today or Sunday will individually see 2.4M or more, and project the same odds for next weekend, this would give an 88% chance of seeing 2.4M either this weekend or next weekend. So I'll lower my forecast slightly to 85%.

The passenger count for 5/21/19 was 2,792,671. \u00a0I asked myself what % of the passenger count of that date in 2019 would it take to achieve a passenger count of 2,400,000 this year. \u00a0Answer = 85.9%. \u00a0That would make it seem that exceeding a passenger count of 2,400,000 on 5/21 is a slam dunk, EXCEPT, in 2019, 5/21 was Memorial Day weekend. \u00a0Not so this year. \u00a0 \u00a0I suspect that the counts for May 20 & 21 this year will be more in line with the counts for other May weekends which will only exceed 2,400,000 if they are more than about 92% of 2019. So, then I looked at the other high count days and asked myself which of them was most likely to exceed 2,400,000. There were 6 days of the remaining days this question will be open in which the counts in 2019 did not exceed 2,400,000, so those 6 days will have to exceed 100% of 2019 \u00a0(May 11, 12, 15, 18, 20 & 23). \u00a0Given what I have read about the reductions in capacity due to staffing issues at the airlines, I think that that is not going to happen! I calculated the % of 2019 that each of the remaining days would have to exceed: May 9 = this year's count would have to exceed 99.2% of the 2019 passenger count for that date May 10 = 95.5% May 13 = 91.9% May 14 = 90.1% May 16 = 91.6% May 17 = 90.7% May 19 = 97.1% May 20 = 89.7% \u00a0(Memorial Day weekend in 2019) May 21 = 85.9% \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"  With the exceptions of May 20 & 21, the higher the percentage required, the lower the likelihood that the threshold of 2,400,000 will be reached, and conversely, the lower the % required, the greater the likelihood that that day will exceed 2,400,000. In the last 7 days, this year's counts have averaged 87.8% of 2019.\u00a0 I think that what I'm seeing is the schedule reductions that the airlines have had to impose because of staffing constraints. To be honest, I've looked at these numbers so much and done so many different calculations (and discovered so many math errors and errors of logic), that I'm totally lacking in confidence. Bottomline: \u00a0I'm probably one of the outliers that mis-guessed the weight of the bull and dragged the average closer to its correct weight. \u00a0LOL. @zdevlinfoltz\u00a0 \u00a0 "], [88783, "2022-05-08T20:57:32Z", [0.95], ""], [1333, "2022-05-08T20:54:05Z", [0.74], ""], [99943, "2022-05-08T19:52:28Z", [0.9], "Just repeating my forecast.

So, in the absence of better data, I'm hypothesizing that they will see similar traffic. So far, these have been the percentages of 2019 traffic seen on each Friday and Sunday in the forecast period:Fridays: 90.2%, 91.7%, 89.5%, 94.1%, 90.9%, 89.4%, 87.6%; range [87.6%, 94.1%]; average 90.5%, SD = 2.05%Sundays: 93.1%, 91.9%, 89.5%, 93.7%, 94.0%, 91.5%, 90.1%; range [89.5%, 93.7%]; average 92.0%, SD = 1.74%.

So, conservatively, let's go with 50% for each of these 4 days. Then P(at least one day will see 2.4M) = (1 - 0.5^4) * 100% = 0.9375 * 100% = 93.75%. Even if we think that the probability that 2.4M won't be reached on each given day is as high as 75%, we would still getP(at least one day will see 2.4M) = (1 - 0.75x0.75x0.75x0.75) x 100% = 68%,just because there are 4 separate chances. I'll maintain my forecast at this level because we have yet to see what the trend will be over the next couple weeks, but I will probably adjust my forecast downward if the percentages trend further downward.

Each line in the TSA table shows numbers for each date in 2022 and the corresponding dates in each previous year, shifted so that the same day of the week is being compared. 5/1/22 is compared with 5/2/21, 5/3/20, and 5/5/19. (The date in the first line of the table today is 5/1/22, and the last line is 5/3/21; tomorrow, the line of data labeled 5/3/21 will be moved to the top of the table, labeled with 5/2/22, and the number for 5/2/22 will be added in the 2022 column.) So, the peak in the 2019 data currently shown in the table in the line labeled 5/21/21, which will shift to 5/20/22 with 2022 data, is actually for 5/24/19, which was the Friday before Memorial Day in 2019. But Memorial Day is on May 30 in 2022. So we can't expect the numbers around 5/20/22 to be nearly as high as on the corresponding date in 2019 (5/24/19). But we still have graduation season starting, and this coming weekend, Mother's Day, which is on May 8, 2022 and was also on May 12, 2019, which lines up perfectly in the table. Fridays and Sundays are most likely to see >2.4M, with Thursdays and Mondays just a bit behind. We have 3 more weekends left in the forecast period. This coming weekend (Mother's Day) probably won't see a day reach 2.4M, but the next weekend might. The past 2 Fridays have seen 2022 numbers at 89.4% and 90.9% of 2019 numbers. If Friday, May 13 sees 90.1% of 2019 travel, then 2.4M will be reached.

In 2021, throughout the entire forecast period, the pattern was reversed: the lowest numbers were mid-week, and Saturdays weren't quite as low. (Does this mean more travel was more business travel in 2021 than in 2019? I'm not sure what to make of this switch.) So far, 2022 has followed the same pattern as 2021.\n* The numbers were really low in 2020.\n* The numbers in 2021 were a bit more than half of those in 2019. The numbers on each day in this period in 2021 were an average of 61% of those in 2019. The numbers in 2021 also started to climb closer to the 2019 numbers throughout the forecast period (and beyond).\n* The numbers in 2022 in the forecast period so far are slightly beneath those in 2019 and track the shape of the 2019 curve very well.\n* 2-5 days each week in the forecast period in 2019 saw numbers above 2.4M. Here are some calculations from the data:\n* The numbers in 2022 in the forecast period have so far averaged ~90% of the 2019 numbers, ranging from 86% to 95% for each individual day.\n* Looking at 0.86 * the numbers in the remainder of the forecast period in 2019, 1 such number is >2.4M - barely (2,401,696 on Friday 5/20/22).\n* Looking at 0.90 * the numbers in the remainder of the forecast period in 2019, 2 such numbers are >2.4M (2,406,272 on 5/19/22, 2,513,403 on 5/20/22).\n* Looking at 0.95 * the numbers in the remainder of the forecast period in 2019, 15 such numbers are >2.4M (starting on 4/8/22).\nThus, if one assumes that no number in the forecast period will be below 86% of the number on the corresponding day in 2019, then we can expect at least one day to be over 2.4M.  But these percentages vary with the day of the week:\n* The peak percentages have occurred each Saturday so far in the forecast period and were 94%, 92% and 95%. Even if every Saturday were at 95% of 2019, no Saturday would exceed 2.4M.\n* The minimum percentages have occurred each Tuesday (and one Wednesday, same value) so far in the forecast period and were 86% (and Wed. 86%), 86%, and 88%. Even if every Tuesday and Wednesday were at 95% of 2019, no Tuesday or Wednesday would exceed 2.4M.\n* On Mondays, the percentages have been 89%, 90% and 90%. If Mondays see 89% or 90% of the corresponding days' numbers in 2019, then we can expect 0 Mondays to be over 2.4M.\n* This means that if a day in the forecast period sees 2.4M, it will almost certainly not be a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Saturday (which one can see just from looking at the numbers anyway). The only somewhat close possible exception would likely be Monday, May 9.\n* Peak travel days of the week are usually Fridays and Sundays. On Fridays, percentages have been 90%, 90%, and 92%. On Sundays, the percentages have been 93%, 92%, and 89%.\n* On Thursdays, the percentages have been 88%, 90% and 91%. \n* If we say that Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays will be at least 88% of the corresponding days in 2019, then we can expect Friday, May 20 to see more than 2.4M screened.\n* If Thursdays see <=89% of  the corresponding days' numbers in 2019, then we can expect 0 Thursdays at or over 2.4M. If Thursdays see 90% or 91% of the corresponding days' numbers in 2019, then we can expect 1 Thursday (May 19) over 2.4M. At 92% or 93%, we can expect 3 Thursdays over 2.4M.\n* If Fridays see 86-90% of the corresponding days' numbers in 2019, then we can expect 1 Friday (May 20) over 2.4M. If Fridays are all at 91% or 92% of 2019 Fridays, then we can expect  2 Fridays (May 13 and 20) to exceed 2.4M. At 93%, 3 Fridays can be expected to exceed 2.4M.\n* If Sundays see <=91% of the corresponding days' numbers in 2019, then we can expect 0 Sundays over 2.4M. If Sundays are all at 92-95% of 2019 Sundays, then we can expect Sunday, May 15 to exceed 2.4M. At 96%, there would be 3 Sundays >2.4M. With reported Covid case numbers are relatively low and continue to fall overall and that most people think the pandemic is over, and with all of the pent-up travel demand, I expect the daily numbers of travelers screened to increase slightly as a percentage of the corresponding numbers in 2019. I expect a small travel boost around Easter, followed by slightly lower numbers for the rest of April, and increases through May to a peak on May 20 and possibly May 22 in the forecast period. Given that Sunday, March 20 already saw 2,366,751 travelers, just shy of 2.4M and 93% of the corresponding day in 2019, and all the considerations above, I think it is all but certain that at least 2.4M will be screened on a single day in the forecast period. Any way I slice or dice it, I come out with at least one, assuming only that demand levels remain at a constant percentage of 2019 levels, on average. While the data are somewhat noisy, and it's possible that 2022 numbers in the forecast period will end up following a different pattern from those in 2019 (e.g., most importantly, around May 20-22), it would take a significant negative departure from current patterns to end up with no days at or over 2.4M. I suspect that if anything, 2022 travel numbers will increase slightly as a fraction of 2019 numbers. Update 4/10:\nFor each day, I calculate that day's number screened as a percentage of the corresponding day's number in 2019.

However, that day would be 5/27 this year, two days after the question closes. There's also a brief bump around Easter during the trough that the rest of April is. So the way I see it, there's a chance we hit it this Friday during a seasonal high, a chance around Easter, and a chance before Memorial day. Otherwise, normal Friday/weekend levels appear to peak right below it around 2.2M or 2.3M.  The 2019 peak on 3/15 of 2.63M was 3.6% higher than 3/8's 2.54M, and a 3.6% bump over 3/11 of this year's 2.29M would be 2.38M, so almost at the threshold. I don't know why that peak existed, so its tough to say whether it'll recur, and hard to outside rate with a single pre-COVID year of data. We'd need a 4.5% jump to hit 2.4M this Friday, so I'd put that as a ~30% chance.  The Easter jumps in 2019 were up to 2.59M, vs 2.54 for March weekends, or 2% higher. That's a smaller jump than the March peak was relative to its adjacent weeks. However, since its because of the Easter holiday, there's a chance that its higher this year with Omicron receding (if it continues receding). 2021 saw a rebound around Easter, but only to ~60% of 2019 levels. The Easter jump may be relatively higher this year as more people travel to visit family. ~30% chance there.  The last major candidate is the Friday before the Friday before Memorial day , which was 5/17 in 2019, and saw 2.66M people, or 4.7% above the March weekend level. It's not as big as the actual Friday before Memorial day, but its still a sizeable peak, as is the Sunday before the Sunday before Memorial day. That 4.7% bump is enough to put us right above the threshold. Outside rate there is probably 50/50 since its so tight, and I'm inclined to keep it around there due to uncertainty around the BA.2 variant, which may start to take off around before then (if it does). So ~50% chance there.  All those combined put us at a 76% chance of being above the threshold at least once. I'm bumping it a bit because we're early into the question, I'll decrease it over time and especially after this Friday if we don't hit the threshold then.

There are 11 Fridays in the forecast period so the cumulative probability for all Fridays is ~8.5%, and Sundays are next with a cumulative probability of ~4.6%.  The other days don't contribute much with a total cumulative probability for all weekdays of 16%.   These statistics are rough and I am not correctly accounting other seasonalities in the data.  I looked at this briefly but even in 2019 (to ignore pandemic impacts) there were no days in March, April, or May that got so far above the YTD average to hit an equivalent target that year.  Considering whether the YTD means are somehow off and will track back towards past levels, I can't really convince myself this is the case.  We have been in the world of high vaccine availability and intermittent new strain case spikes for a long time.  The Delta variant was discovered in 2020 and named in May 2021. It is easier to convince myself that the lower average travel numbers reflect some realisation that people are productive using video communications so travel spending has a poor return.  From the travel data there may be some evidence of this in that the weekday travel patterns of strong Sundays and Fridays in 2022 are different to 2019.  So 'return to normal' is not just an upward shift the mean.  So this says ignore the older data and trust the current mean and variance. I do have some doubts in my fancy math and quick spreadsheeting so I am adding another 4%.  This is on top of my lazy statistics that I think are overestimating by ignoring covariance with straight sums of the daily probabilities.

The gist is that airlines struggled to get revenue to recover with passenger counts because business travelers were staying home and they are extremely high margin ticket buyers. The revenue stuff isn't so relevant, but the missing business travelers might still be, and it might also alter the calculus for airlines when deciding how many and which flights to offer. Even though offices are starting to open up some, I'm skeptical that between economic concerns of inflation and probably fewer people being willing to take a European vacation at the moment, that we will continue to see a large recovery in airline travel. I don't think it's going to crater, but I think the ceiling might temporarily be lower than one would expect based on pure history.
