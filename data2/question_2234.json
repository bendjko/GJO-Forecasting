Though the WTO meeting on May 6 went \"well\" regarding the waivers, it is made clear that there are still no agreeable terms; just no outright rejections among member states.

Prior to last week, there were at least 29 countries (UK/Switzerland/EU) that dissented on this topic. Last week a draft document from the negotiation among the Quad members who previously dissented on the TRIPS waiver was released for all to review prior to the upcoming WTO meeting in June. A few issues still remain to be resolved though my estimate is that the fact that they released the draft assigns an 80% favorable probability that the TRIPS waiver will be passed with enough support of those mentioned and those not factored for. I think there is still a 30% chance that the dissenting countries will end up dissenting to stand in solidarity with core IP rules.

While there is a small level of public pressure in the EU, I cannot think of a scenario where it sharply rises two years into the pandemic.  There will be even less will to establish further precedent for TRIPS waivers if omicron is seen - as it increasingly is by European politicians - as the \"high transmissibility/low severity\" variant. European WTO delegates will not make it a consensus vote, and the price/benefit ration for rocking the boat will keep worsening for those who would hope to get a 3/4ths vote. If pharmaceutical companies continue investing into their COVID-19 IP - like updating to account for new variants [2] [3] - they will continue lobbying as severely as thus far to guarantee a return on those investments and not endanger future opportunities. One alternative scenario could be one where precisely a lower risk assessment of omicron combined with rapid development of antivirals [4] sees European countries shift to a strategy of managing COVID-19 with therapeutics rather than successive booster shots, which are much less popular with their citizens. In such a scenario, TRIPS waivers for vaccines could be seen as a good faith engagement - though the question remains of just how much potential pharmaceutical companies will see in a \"captive\" market in low-vaccination-rate countries. Also, this hinges on a majority of the big players releasing approved therapeutics, something which is still some time away.

Moreover, much will depend upon how much either side is willing to compromise. More than 100 countries backing the waiver say it will help save lives by allowing developing countries to produce COVID-19 vaccines. But a handful of countries, including some hosting major pharmaceutical firms such as Switzerland [also the United Kingdom, Germany & Norway], remain opposed. China in the same meeting described the discussions as circular, with no real progress achieved, according to one of the sources attending. India's delegate said that some members had done everything in their power to avoid meaningful engagement, Opponents said in Monday's discussions that it was not yet clear that a waiver would help remove barriers to vaccine equity such as raw material scarcity and supply chain issues, https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/year-after-covid-vaccine-waiver-proposal-wto-talks-are-deadlocked-2021-10-04/ While intellectual property rights are not the only reason for inequitable access to COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics, they are a significant barrier. Similarly, while a waiver is not the only means to tackle the lack of access to health technologies, it is an essential element in facilitating equitable access. ... there are ample precedents for WTO waivers, including in the area of intellectual property. The 2001 Doha Declaration, for example, was partly implemented through a time limited waiver furthering public health objectives relating to access to medicines. This situation persists despite the vast majority of WTO member states bearing obligations under either the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), which covers the rights to health and science and the principle of non-discrimination, or the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which includes the rights to life, equality and the principle of non-discrimination.\nOn November 8, the International Commission of Jurists published a legal opinion on the proposed waiver. The opinion, which has been endorsed by 140 experts worldwide, argues that member states of the WTO who are also party to either the ICESCR and ICCPR have, at the very least, an obligation to not oppose or obstruct the proposed waiver. Where such states obstruct the proposed waiver, they are acting in defiance of this legally binding obligation. https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2021/11/30/rich-countries-must-stop-blocking-the-covid-vaccine-patent-waiver The German government said while they support global vaccine supplies, \"the protection of intellectual property is a source of innovation and must remain so in the future.\"\nThe government, instead, said production capacity and quality control were the key impediments to widening access to vaccines \u2014 not intellectual property rights. While Albert Bourla, CEO of vaccine maker Pfizer said his company was \"not at all\" in favor of the waivers, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she would be open to discussion on the topic. https://www.dw.com/en/germany-rejects-us-push-to-waive-covid-vaccine-patents/a-57453453"], [86607, "2021-12-30T18:38:30Z", [0.08], ""], [80970, "2021-12-30T18:13:45Z", [0.0], "Lol c'mon now"]]}
