Capital Discipline with Strong Free Cash Flow:  After years of boom and bust cycles, it appears this time may be different in the near-term.  Large US shale oil and natural gas companies have shifted their focus to incorporate capital discipline.  Effectively, they are using their free cash flow from profitable wells to (A) return capital to shareholders and (B) pay down debt.  The first page of the PXD earnings presentation talks about paying an \"Inaugural Variable Dividend\" and throughout the EOG earnings presentation they reference paying down debt, returning capital to shareholders, and maintaining production (note: not increasing production). 2.  OPEC+ Micromanagement:  The body language out of the Saudi Arabia oil minister is that OPEC+ wants to keep the market slightly undersupplied through April 2022.  This means monitoring demand at a monthly frequency and adjusting production accordingly.  If the Delta variant persists and keeps demand from increasing, OPEC+ is likely to limit the amount of new production coming to the market.    3. Iran Talks with the US have Staled:  All indications that new supply from Iran coming to the market as a result of JCPOA negotiations is unlikely.   4. Covid-19:  This is the wildcard in my forecast for three of reasons (A) Vaccines are not approved for children under 12, (B) Global vaccination rates dramatically vary by country, and (C) New variants that further reduce vaccine efficacy.  From a demand modeling perspective, it is relatively easy to extrapolate current trends.  Further, if we have a significant increase in demand due to a waning of the pandemic demand will increase and OPEC+ will increase supply to avoid $80 per barrel oil prices or more.  OPEC+ does not want to incentivize US shale players to drill new wells.  At the same time, it is hard to model weaker-than-expected demand as this would imply a combination of a new variant, government lockdowns, and / or the unvaccinated becoming a large problem.  As a result, I see the demand skew (with respect to market expectations) with more downside risk. 5. The US Dollar:  A number of forecasters have indicated that the dollar may increase to decrease.  There are arguments for and against a change in the US dollar from real rate differentials, market positioning via futures, twin deficits in the US, relative monetary policy, etc.  From my perspective, the risk is fairly balanced in the next six months.  While I believe the US dollar should depreciate due to the large twin deficits (fiscal and trade), in the near-term a hawkish fed (i.e. starting a tapering program) and strong real growth from a consumer that has significant savings may keep the US dollar supported.  2022 may be the year of US dollar weakness as the world reopens from Covid-19.

Supply:  Oil and OPEC+ have been surprisingly well disciplined.  While the forecast period still have 5+ months, and I'm skeptical production discipline remains into 2022, I have to acknowledge this surprise [https://www.naturalgasintel.com/eps-to-repeat-capital-discipline-mantra-in-2q-results-but-ofs-may-signal-price-increases/].  This discipline is a desire to avoid an oil price collapse by keeping supply tight.  With that said, OPEC+ still needs to resolve the dispute with the UAE around increasing their baseline.  While there are news stories that indicate a deal has been reached, it still needs to be approved by OPEC+.  If one country wants to increase production, should we not expect other countries to private encourage as well? 2. Demand:  Based on EIA and OPEC forecasts, demand into 2H'2021 and into 1H'2022 is expected to be near 2019 levels - around 100 mb/d.  I'm concerned this is too rosy, as it does not seem to consider the impact of new and existing Covid-19 variants around the world.  When schools and offices reopen in the fall and we move into the winter with at least 20% of the adult population in many developed economies choosing not to be vaccinated, it is not hard to foresee oil demand waning.

Some people consider the delta to be a good approximation of the probability the call finishes in the money, i.e. here the probability that crude oil is at least $70 per barrel. The high-level idea is that a $1 increase in the underlying will result in a $1 * p increase in the value of the option, where p is the probability of finishing in the money, because the option needs to finish in the money to \"enjoy\" or \"receive\" that dollar increase. Since the delta is calculated to be 0.55, we estimate this probability at 55%.

However, in my view asset markets, such as the price of Brent crude oil, are typically based on forward expectations of supply and demand with about a 6-month implicit forward view. So from my perspective, the way to answer this question is to try to ascertain expectations for oil supply and demand in Q1 and Q2\u20192022. The EIA is a source of oil supply and demand forecasts through 2021 and into 2022.

Further, there are several other factors to consider:\nOil Supply: The longer oil prices remain above $50, production for US shale may increase.  For context, US oil production reached 20.20 million barrels in Q4\u20192019 and it is not projected to reach that level until at least Q4\u20192022 (at 20.40).  If US shale producers increase rig counts combined with their increased productivity per well, US supply could surprise to the upside.  If oil supply surprises the upside, prices will be pressed downward. Oil Demand:  Global reopening through increased covid-19 vaccinations could surprise to the upside and I could see oil prices increases in the next 3-months.  If the reopening is stronger than expected, this would be a reason I underestimate the probability.   What to Watch:\n- US Shale Production - both the number of oil rigs and oil production:  For context, the cost to extract oil from US shale reserves is generally less than $50 per barrell\n- OPEC+ Production and Upcoming Meetings\n- US - Iran Negotiations\n- Mideast & Geopolitics Areas I'm Downplaying Due to the Time Horizon:\n- ESG and Climate Change are long-term impacts on oil prices, and they may actually be positive for oil prices before they are negative due to lower Capex.  It will take a long time for economies to shift away from fossil fuels so demand will be fairly consistent.  If Capex were to fall (i.e. new well being drilled), supply may be constrained, which could actually increase oil prices. Given that the models expect oil supply and demand to be in equilibrium at the end of 2021 with oversupply into early 2022, I estimate the a 30% probability that Brent oil prices will be above $70 on 30 December 2021.
