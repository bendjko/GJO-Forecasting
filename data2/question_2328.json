At the same time, they have not yet started significant tapering of their asset purchases which is how the FED likes to try and adjust the long end of the curve. This should naturally put pressure on the curve to flatten and eventually invert, as the FEDs actions should increase 2-Year yields faster than 10-Years. To add to all of this there are people in the markets raising concerns about a recession, or at least slower growth caused by large inflation among several other factors.
