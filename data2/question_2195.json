Still, I may update during the race if Hamilton manages to get into the top four or five within the first few laps, which is easy to imagine after his jackrabbit start in the sprint and his easy passes on several of the fast drivers who will be starting ahead of him after the five-spot penalty (Norris, Leclerc, Gasly, and Vettel). I've also slightly downgraded Verstappen after he lost the sprint to Bottas. And I'm now giving \"another result\" (primarily Bottas) a 35% chance after Bottas's outstanding job holding Verstappen at bay for the final third of the sprint race.
