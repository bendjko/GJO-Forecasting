The Gracenote Virtual Medal Table projects a drop of 15 medals in Tokyo this year from their 2016 total of 67. The British team is therefore likely to drop out of the top-three medal winning countries but 52 medals should be enough to achieve a fourth successive top-5 finish. The reduction in medals for Britain is partially due to lower expectations in cycling \u2013 track, gymnastics \u2013 artistic and rowing amongst other competitions. In 2016, those three sports accounted for nearly one third of British medals (22). In 2021 however, these sports could produce as few as five podium places. China\n(Tokyo 2020: 66 medals, 2016: 70 medals)\nChina\u2019s total of 70 medals in 2016 was the country\u2019s lowest return since 2004 and the current Gracenote projection for Tokyo 2020 is lower than this. However, many members of the Chinese Olympic team have not competed since 2019 and may therefore be underrated by the Virtual Medal Table. China edged Great Britain into second place in Rio by a margin of three medals. This time, host nation Japan and the Russian Olympic Committee competitors could challenge China for second place on total medals. The data suggests that China will be well ahead of both on gold medals though. Team GB has to also compete against Japan who will have a stronger showing as its a home Olympics.   I hadn\u2019t considered the thoughts on the cycling.  Many of the successful track team are now in their 30s and given the scandals it\u2019s not clear that this team has as many good younger competitors.  Rowing is in a similar position after having a period with significant strong competitors.  If these two areas are not as strong there is a lot less opportunity for medals, let alone golds.  Yes Team GB might pick up a few from the new sports, but these are unlikely to be as many as are not taken else where. Reducing Team GB chances to hardly possible at all.

However, there are not too many data points so it is hard to make a strong trend about this. I think it is more important to look at the athletes they have and how their performances compare.

China's population is 21 time that of GB, so they are expected to win 21 times the amount of medals as GB. While somewhat useful in measuring odds of a superhuman athlete being from China rather than GB, the Olympics feature the most talented athletes around the world. As many of the peers on my team have done, the historical performance of China has been 22.4 gold medals per game, and GB is only at 9.39. One additional consideration is that in many events, the gold and bronze aren't too far off, so silver and bronze medals by these countries should be considered as well. However, China averages 54.6 medals per game while GB averages 30.4 medals. Looking at current year predictions, China is forecasted to win 42 gold medals, while GB is forecasted to win only 20.\nLet us consider what the possible scenarios are for GB to win more gold medals than China. If China's athletes are not allowed or unable to compete due to the pandemic, clearly that would result in fewer medals. The vaccine status is more prevalent in developed countries, but this risk is low since Olympic athletes are likely more readily available to access vaccines. Another case is that GB outperforms and beats China, but this is also very low likelihood since the sheer number of Chinese athletes makes it hard to prevent any gold medals from being earned. A more likely scenario is that the US beats China, resulting in China having a lot of silver medals and GB edging out in more esoteric events. Historically, GB has dominated events such as sailing and athletics, whereas China dominated in table tennis and badminton, neither of which US is particularly strong in. The most medals come from diving and swimming, where there are multiple events for medals, and so it's possible that the US sweeps swimming and essentially pushes China and GB to compete in their dominant sports. However, since China has won much more than GB in those respective sports with nearly 30 golds in each of weightlifting, diving, and table tennis, GB is likely still going to have fewer gold medals.\nIf we assume a difference of 12 medals (near historical averages) and a variance of 5, a normally distributed medal count suggests 5% chance GB has more gold medals.
