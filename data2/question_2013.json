And while there is rain in most days it looks more showery than set in \nhttps://www.meteoblue.com/en/weather/week/southampton_united-kingdom_2637487 So with the option of the 6th day, as no one wants a draw, I still think we\u2019ll get a result. As @Sports_and_Science asks if we do lose a day does it become a 4 day test.  Not sure it does, it starts as 5 day and the time payed doesn\u2019t change that I believe.  Not sure the follow on is going to be relevant this time though, both teams have better more experienced batting than England! Reading up on team selection, I think this might be a battle of the fast bowlers.  That and the patience of the Indian bowlers in front of the NZ pluggers.  Given forecast not sure either side will go for much spin, maybe wrong though. It\u2019s really really close.  Advantage NZ as they\u2019ve just won a series and practiced in competitive games (although not sure the 2nd test v England was that competitive!).  But advantage India as they\u2019ve been at the Aegas Bowl for a couple of weeks and have been playing on the ground (but probably not the test pitch) and will have a really good feel for the ground conditions. Batting first might be an advantage if a wet pitch gets dodgy, but equally if it\u2019s going to rain tomorrow not sure I\u2019d want to bat on that.  Toss might have an impact as whoever wins will know how wet it is before starting rather than having to guess on if it\u2019s going to rain. Too tight to call.  Leaving draw as low because both sides want a result and might play to risk a result, not like England copping out in the 1st test and being totally boring.  They could have gone for it!  Imagine a declaration on day 5 with 250-300 to win\u2026 But I go with @Eliac that India have a lot to prove and have been improving abroad so give them the edge.

The Rose Bowl is historically one of the better grounds for spin, so NZ might have a tricky decision if they were to win the toss if there is a lot of cloud cover and rain in the air.\nOne curious thing - if Friday is a complete washout, is the game still considered a 5d test?

And, without ever getting the technicalities of this, I get the impression it might be really food for swing.  That favours NZ in both batting and bowling.  India have struggled a bit with swing.  Dukes balls being used, which are the England balls.  Again good for swing, but India bowlers have also liked the seam, so that feels reasonably neutral. Even if India don\u2019t usually do well abroad, in the past couple of Series in England they have managed wins and draws.  Given England conditions are similar to NZ then the best indication is how India do in NZ, which is hard as they don\u2019t often go and only for 2 tests, but again there have been wins and draws. It feels quite evenly spread.  NZ advantage for conditions, but India are always a strong team and cannot be ruled out.  It will be quite a lot of prestige to win the first test championship, so I\u2019m guessing India will be really motivated given how big cricket is in India ( not that NZ aren\u2019t but cricket is a religion in India and some good news would go down well at the moment). Even chance, but just shading NZ.  Draw always a possibility, but with 6th day available if can\u2019t make up full time in 5 days (ie if we lose more than half a day to rain) this also reduces the likelihood of a draw. Game very very unlikely to be cancelled now given both teams are here and bubbling.  Even if infections go mad after hot bank holiday weekend this weekend (and everyone going out and about) at the worst they are likely to play behind closed doors.

India were badly mauled in a 2 test series in NZ last year, and they represent the closest conditions to English conditions. India won in Australia earlier in the year, despite one or two poor batting performances. However, New Zealand are already in England, and plan against England before this one-off game which means they will be battle hardened, and will be playing competitive cricket whilst the Indian team are in lockdown. The corollary is they may be jaded after two games against England - especially if the pitches are flat and the bowlers are forced to bowl a lot of overs (no laughing please - I realise England's batting is fragile).  The draw is a possibility, but with a 6th day and the long term weather prediction suggesting limited rain (i realise not entirely reliable but it's something)."], [80790, "2021-05-19T08:27:14Z", [0.41, 0.34, 0.16, 0.09], "Finally a cricket question!  This is the perfect sport for forecasting as so many weird things can happen. Ties are extremely rare.  Draws reasonably common, but seem to be less so the way players are playing at the moment.\nIt may be cancelled, but cricket has been successfully carried out by serious bubbling for players, press and staff all the way through last summer and over the winter in some countries.  The UK did it last summer, so have experience.  A good number of international players have already been in India for the IPL until it was cancelled and I imagine most have been vaccinated so can\u2019t see cancellation happening, especially as the UK cases are ok.  It depends on what happens on the 3 week lag from lockdown easing. As for India v New Zealand.  New Zealand are good at the moment and India are more set up towards shorter form games, but they have a lot of really good players and came top 2 in the champs by playing more games and therefore winning more games than NZ. But weather has been soggy in UK this month, and needs to be dry and warm for India spinners to be most effective.  Weather will be close to NZ, which ups NZ chances.  NZ have a good chance, but India are the favourites. Have to spread forecast though as anything can happen."], [99407, "2021-05-19T07:47:50Z", [0.6, 0.35, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [92079, "2021-05-19T05:09:39Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [11895, "2021-05-19T04:51:18Z", [0.34, 0.56, 0.08, 0.02], ""], [84880, "2021-05-19T03:14:53Z", [0.47, 0.47, 0.05, 0.01], ""], [101041, "2021-05-19T03:05:56Z", [0.4, 0.55, 0.05, 0.0], "New Zealand players already in UK and in quarantine mid-May.
