To maximize probability of success, Dr. He\u2019s MO was to impregnate with more than one embryo \u2013 almost standard practice with IVF. Probability of twins now with IVF is from 40% to even 60%. In reality, Dr. He faced another barrier to  impregnate with two or three embryos \u2013 he needed to show that the embryos were properly edited. The data shows that he had difficulties with CRISPR editing \u2013 he got mosaic twins, which means that only some of the cells were properly edited for HIV resistance, some were not edited and some may have been edited not in the way Dr. He intended.\nhttps://www.technologyreview.com/s/614762/crispr-baby-twins-lulu-and-nana-what-happened/ Given that BBC told that the other pregnancy was \"an embryo\", I am significantly reducing probability of multiple babies from the IVF baseline to 10%. 2. Some people give close to 100% to probability that more than one CRISPR-edited babies will be born through other groups\u2019 efforts. IMHO it's because  they do not consider how it works. On one hand, in all countries where science and technology are advanced enough to produce such babies, there are huge barriers to do so - every clinical study/trial goes through regulatory bodies where along with ethical questions, harm to participants is thoroughly evaluated. It is true for both, public and private entities. On the other hand, there are not that many scientific groups who can do that, and they form a community where this topic is essentially solved with consensus - it is too early from both, technological and ethical points of view, to edit human genome. So, there is no way that other such babies were produced in the question timeframe. Dr. He is rather a rogue scientist  who succeeded because (from the Western point of view at least) in China there were not enough barriers to prevent such an attempt to proceed. The fact that China swiftly moved on Dr. He and his group is evidence that any loopholes there were closed for any other group.\nDon't get me wrong. Yes, with CRISPR (or other technology) it looks unstoppable that at some point human embryos will be edited on mass scale. It is just not at this point as the technology is still not that wide spread and involves big, but limited number of groups who can do that. Russian Dr. Rebrikov claims he will do it safely. AFAIK, Dr. Rebrikov claimed he has been ready to CRISPR-edit babies for the last 5 years, but never produced one. But this way he gets funding and publicity. And do not discount Russian regulatory after China's clampdown. 3. At this point the crowd gives more probability - 40% - to the chance of 0 babies than to 1 - 27% - on assumption that the other baby besides twins may have been born, but there is little chance that China would announce that publicly. But I'd think that GJOP rather suspends this question than resolve it as 0 babies, knowing that most probably the baby was born, just not proclaimed being born. 4. But there could be a failure of the other pregnancy as well, especially as all IVF manipulations are supposedly not conducive to health of pregnancy and miscarriages happen even with normal pregnancies. Or China forced parents to abort or after birth it was shown  that it was no enough editing to consider babies to be CRISPR gene-edited. That's why I give 21% to 0 babies bucket -  roughly one fifth of first pregnancies end up in miscarriages and forced abortions have been norm in China.\n"], [691, "2019-12-04T15:31:06Z", [0.5, 0.4, 0.1], ""], [80475, "2019-12-04T00:29:21Z", [0.95, 0.04, 0.01], "The technology now exists, so I'd say yes most likely (90%), although it would be done in secret.

The second woman must already have been pregnant in November 2018 when the Chinese authorities shut down He's research programme therefore if there is a third CRISPR baby then it will have been born sometime between December 2018 and July 2019 i.e. between three and twelve months ago. Splitting the difference gives a birth date of 7 months ago, so with no official announcement from China so far and only 1.5 months to go until the close of the question, I'm going to say there's is a 1.5 / 7 = 18.75% chance of China officially confirming the birth of a third CRISPR baby before the question closes.

One may argue that the Chinese government is incentivized to avoid losing face and would therefore hide the fact of the birth. However, I think the government can reasonably claim that the pregnancy was far along at the time the rules were tightened, effectively absolving them of any responsibility and allowing them to scapegoat professor He. It's worth pointing out that the government did confirm the pregnancy [2], which makes it more likely it'd provide information about the birth as well. On the other hand, a realpolitik argument would be that the government may want to obfuscate with the purpose of keeping its hands close to its chest regarding a new technology over which world powers will be competing going forward. I assume the pregnancy is 90% likely to be true, I give another 10% for miscarriage or abortion, and 50% chance of the Chinese government releasing information before the end of the year, leading to a probability of 36% for \"1\".

This becomes a little like the question \"how many piano tuners in Chicago?\" How many scientists, or amateurs, have the skills and tools to use CRISPR in this way? This brief timeline of CRISPR research shows multiple laboratories across the world researching the subject, and reaching similar discoveries almost simultaneously. The community of scientists and technicians that COULD edit an embryo is small but not everyone-fit-around-one-dinner-table small. According to Wikipedia, there are 131 R-1 universities in the USA. Let's guess that there are at least that many equivalent universities in the rest of the world. Not all of them will have a biomedical area studying CRISPR, but some may have more than one team working on the topic. So maybe roughly 100 teams, of 5-ish people? Maybe a few more? Then the question becomes, how many of those 500+ people would be willing to do the experiment, given the current state of knowledge. There are high risks, and it is not clear that the rewards would be worthwhile. \nStudies are being conducted on using CRISPR on currently living people with cancer, It appears there is agreement that that is a better first step than editing and implanting embryos.\nMy intuition is that I may be underestimating the number of people who could edit. However, with world social pressure appearing strongly against it, those people would need an intensely strong reason to do so- whether personal to people close to them, financial, or authorities telling them to do so. So what is the probability of a lone actor or small team trying it? Small but not zero. And I agree with other people's comments, that if it is happening, it may be not shared with the public.

In June, the Russian biologist told Nature he planned to gene-edit human embryos and then bring them to term. To date, only one person - Chinese scientist He Jiankui - has ever openly produced gene-edited babies, with the claim that the edits would prevent the babies from inheriting their fathers' HIV. On Thursday, Rebrikov told New Scientist he has five pairs of Russian parents eager to let him gene-edit their embryos for a different and socially loaded reason: to prevent the offspring from inheriting their parents' deafness. Rebrikov told New Scientist that each parent interested in his study is deaf due to mutations in their GJB2 gene.

If we don't hear anything more about the (alleged) ongoing pregnancy, does that resolve as 0? What about unconfirmed reports? Such as it is: 1) I'm pretty confident, notwithstanding the lack of independent confirmation, that He's work has resulted in 2 live births and one ongoing pregnancy. I'm sceptical of wholesale fraud explanations proposed for the following reasons: a) If He wanted to fraudulently claim he had done this, it seems more in his interest to pretend to have done the work well rather than poorly. Why would he not lie and say (for example) he had perfectly repeated the CCR5 mutation he intended, rather than the messed up modifications he did? Why not lie and say one had conducted the consent procedure etc. to unimpeachable standards, rather than the misgivings identified.  b) Given the penalties He is suffering as a result of his work, it would seem advantageous to him to 'come clean' about this deception - the penalties for scientific fraud would probably be less. c) The Chinese government is well-placed to discover if He's claims are fraudulent, and if it knew this it seems in their interest to declare this. Yet they have not. 2) Thus my impression of the ground truth is there is/was a further pregnancy as He noted, and so (as another forecaster notes) this would have a high likelihood of being born at term. Given the subsequent controversy, I think it is very unlikely there have been other attempts to 'CRISPR children'. 3) Most of the 34% 0 mass is coming from the 1 mass, trying to factor in the uncertainty of how the ground truth will manifest and how the question will be judged. It seems pretty likely even if my take is correct, it is fairly likely there will be no announcement when the 'third child' is born, and on that I guess the question would resolve zero.  I'll steadily shift from 1 to 0 in the absence of any such announcement from ~~August/September onwards, as this is roughly the time a birth would be expected. Naturally it goes up with further media reports.

As a result, the Chinese government pledged to launch a criminal investigation.  Other countries seem to be much more cautious (and legislatively restrictive in the case of the US, UK, Canada, France, Germany, Australia, and Brazil) with biotech, and will be even more so after the reporting on this situation. But restrictive legislation and policy may only be relevant to the reporting of genetic modification in humans. (3) As global actors have similarly condemned and denounced, however the scientific community cautions against such a negative focus on gene editing. Organizing-committee member Alta Charo, a bioethicist at the University of Wisconsin Law School in Madison, said expectations have to be realistic. \u201cYou can\u2019t expect perfection. What you can do is try to minimize these incidents with enforcements that punish rogue behaviour.\u201d(4) This leads me to predict that vague policy and insufficient oversight of the use of CRISPR or other gene\u2010editing technologies and the possibility of failures to report certain scientific achievements, along with global condemnation of a controversial branch of science will limit the occurrence of such practices but not fully prevent the possibility. As of now the scientific community seems set on moving forward with the use of CRISPR, and given how quickly it has spread someone will continue to research on editing genes in human embryos, but not necessarily with the intent of modifying a baby to be born.

However, he has also claimed that there is already another ongoing pregnancy (as mentioned in the question). That being said, it is important to recognize the legal issues surrounding this. Jiankui is already in trouble with the Chinese government, despite it not being clearly defined whether this study was illegal under Chinese law (https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a25385071/gene-editing-crispr-cas9-legal/). The vast majority of countries that invest heavily in scientific research already have laws in place prohibiting this type of gene editing.

It is unclear to me what incentive He or the goverment have for lying about this. I'd say that as of January there was an 85% chance that the second pregnant woman did indeed exist.  If that was the case, one would expect the baby to be born this year, barring miscarriage or abortion. Miscarriage risk seems fairly low given that the pregnancy was likely somewhat advanced at that point, perhaps 5%. Abortion seems somewhat unlikely, given the state of the pregnancy at the time. Another 5% perhaps. This reduces the probability to ~77%. The interesting question is whether we would learn about the birth for the question to resolve positively. The Chinese government interests seem to dominate here, since I suspect He not to have control over this anymore.  It's not clear to me what they would gain from an announcement, especially given their recent rule tightening [3]. There are some rumours that they were involved in the He experiment [4], but I find that implausible given He's behavior. Overall, I think they'd only announce this with a probability of 20%, giving an overall probability of 15%. Are there other such experiments that we don't know about?  That's plausible, but China seems like the most likely country to move ahead here currently. Other countries seem to be much more cautious with biotech, and will be even more so after the He fiasco. Nonstate actors also seem fairly implausible. All of that should receive further penalty for only being relevant insofar as the births are announced. Overall, I guess 3% for a CRISPR baby being born we have not yet heard of. That gives 18% for 1 baby being born. I'll give 1% for more than 1 for uncertainty.

Given this climate of control rather than ban, and the fact that a Switzerland-based company operating in the US has announced the use of CRISPR to combat blood diseases, with one patient already receiving treatments and another lined for treatment in mid 2019, it seems unlikely that there will not be another attempt at editing embryos [3]. The medical and technological benefits already outweighed ethical considerations in the case of He Jiankui, and with the current international opinion being to regulate rather than ban, the first nations that can fully utilize this technology will have an advantage over those who do not. From a realist and constructivist international perspective it is more likely that we will see another gene edited baby than not. From a realist perspective, this technology will allow for a physically healthier society, impacting both the quality of its military and economic output.
