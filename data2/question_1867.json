So I'll dodge the question and just re-state my past screed and look for outside attacks to convince me of further adjustment. I'm clearly in the weeds from the crowd and have been for some time. China has much to gain by making concessions and so does USA in this matter: A Jewel of Chinese society was plucked from them... \"ordered\" by USA \"via\" Canada (to honour the terms of an extradition treaty) based on info USA provided. The story on the veracity of the \"basis\" provided is murky.  Two days after the Jewel was plucked, two of Canada's small fry were tossed in the hoosegow on dubious charges with no consular access to begin, and little kindness since. This is China's approach to things shown plain. The Jewel is living very well in Vancouver and free to move around (with a bracelet on her ankle) throughout her trial. The Jewel is being heartily defended in a long drawn out court matter, in which the Jewel's defence has been given exceptionally wide leeway by the courts while the small fry rot in China. This is Canada's approach to things shown plain.  The world sees this plainly. Canada is in an impossible situation to bring about the return of their small fry.  USA and China both have much to gain.  1. USA \"owes\" Canada for having put them into this position. (there is noted \"dubiousity\" in the precision and intent by which USA ordered the Canadian grab in Vancouver and Canada has \"possibly\" been duped into it by eager apparatchiks of a past administration. \n2. China seeks the return of the Jewel. Side benefits: each side can make an important win to their individual i\"close-in\" interests by making this go away.  The question ends in 7 weeks. PLENTY of time remains for the \"diplomacy\" front to play out. Like the NordStream stepdown yesterday by USA to support its important relationship with Germany, these can  and often are \"over\" in a single press release.

Or perhaps the Canadian judge will exclude that information, under advisement from US prosecutors, and continue with the current schedule. Either way, it is feasible that China proclaims that US & Canada are colluding in order to ensure Meng's extradition. In that case, in the short term, pending the final verdict in the extradition trial, the publicatiuon of the verdicts and potential subsequent release of the two Michaels seems unlikely within the  time frame of the question. Also noteworthy, thanks to @Jean-luc-Nadeau (https://bit.ly/2Qy7H4q), is the proposed application for adjournment of the last 3 weeks of the extradition trial by Meng's lawyers (https://bit.ly/32kNPV4). This could potentially hint at two or more outcomes; a deal has been agreed in the background and will be announced soon  for Meng's transfer to US? or for Meng's release to return to China? or possibly as @Jean-luc-Nadeau suggests, more delays are inevitable? Monday's application in Canada may hint at what is to follow. However, as @Mark_T pointed out,(https://bit.ly/3dtkSgd), relations between US & China have deteriorated in recent times. Hence, on the face of it, a deal seems unlikely. But perhaps a deal on this issue could break the downward spiral of the two superpowers' relations and reset the tone to move forward while at the same time, give Canada a bit of a reprieve?

Combined with the escalation in US v China tensions around Taiwan [1] (which I think can be read as China flexing in front of a new President and testing the new administration's response), @bh4eh 's points all indicate a potential narrowing of the window for diplomatic solutions for the two Michaels. That said...the Meng Wanzhow extradition trial is due to wrap in mid May 21 (pending appeals), and may still represent an opportunity for a \"back room\" diplomatic off ramp for both the US government and Canada on the sticky issue of the Huawei CEO conundrum that they inherited from the diplomatic lump hammer that was the previous administration. A release of the two Michaels following on the back of a failed extradition proceeding for Meng is still possible (even with convictions in the kangaroo closed Court proceedings) as part of China's consistently Janus like behaviour (trade and economic ties one minute, sabre rattling and shows of strength the next). That said, relations across all involved parties have steadily degraded over the last two months and the hot rhetoric of this moment makes a climb down by July this year politically painful for any side (being read as it would as a capitulation to the other side's strength).  Whilst I see it likely that the Michaels and Meng Wanzhou will both be released back to their respective countries within days of each other within the next 12 - 18 months I can't see it happening in the next 3 months with the tone and tenor of current discourse. The only remaining opening seems to be the extradition hearing outcomes in May being used by one side or the other as a politically expedient off ramp (see rationale here: https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1229061) and the window for that also seems to have narrowed. with the time for this question ticking down steadily the likelihood of this resolving before July seems increasingly low.

Although we do not know the extent of the agreement in smells to me though HSBC is either under pressure in HK or attempting appease China. I suspect the former. Will this apparent step forward in Meng's case in Canada be of any use to the two Michaels? I suspect there is more to this than meets the eye and there is the possibility of a backroom deal being put in place.  In time for this question to resolve? Possibly though I am not convinced. All the necessary pieces have to be put in place and the US may well be reluctant to play ball. That said, Biden's administration may view this as an opportunity to appease Xi / China in some way after the rather terse meeting a few weeks ago. Equally, as France 24 notes (https://bit.ly/3tiplri) Meng's extradition trail is scheduled to end in mid-May, barring any appeals. Which is likely unless a backroom deal has been concluded. It's very possible IMO that the two Michaels' verdicts in their recent trail may be released around the time of the end of Meng's trial depending on the verdict in Canada.

Hence, IMO, China is unlikely to ignore and brush off these comments. Certainly not as far as internal consumption is concerned. That begs two questions; a) is Canada's hope misplaced and b) why has China, apparently quite suddenly, announced a) the trial of the two Canadians is expected soon and b) almost 24 hours later announced the trial will start tomorrow and is schedule for 2 days? 2 days is an incredibly short time for what is (in western terms) a complex matter. Equally, China's courts have a notoriously high conviction rate. Particularly in matters such as this. See https://bit.ly/3tCvgqS. Thanks also to @Jean-luc-Nadeau for his link in his forecast (https://bit.ly/3r0pvlo ) confirming the trial from another source. From what little information we have regarding the Chinese prosecution and the charges, I suspect the trial will lead to a conviction.

Hence, what will happen in court tomorrow and Monday is unlikely to be transparently reported. Hence, I am reducing my forecast as above. @sebawi & @SE_Meyer for info in case you've not seen this.

I\u2019ve definitely been close to lowering my confidence and probability forecast - I still might, just mulling it over. Also, as a Canadian, I certainly hope I\u2019m wrong! Based on your feedback, I agree my logic could be sharper for bullet (2). Specifically, I think it is fair that Canada can not \u2018drop\u2019 the case, but it is a different event for the USA to agree to a settlement with Meng / Huawei where the case is instead \u2018resolved through normal course\u2019. That would not be negotiating in a \u2018hostage diplomacy\u2019 situation, from the USA perspective. It also makes sense that the \u2018end game\u2019 for any USA administration is not exactly having Meng \u2018behind bars\u2019 in the States - it would be to levy a hefty fine on Huawei (I\u2019m guessing substantially more than the $1B fine on ZTE), have both Meng and Huawei admit to wrongdoing, and potentially agree to some further operating constraints or discipline against the company. Canada\u2019s situation may urge the USA to \u2018hurry up\u2019, so the Michael\u2019s DO seem like the main reason this could all possibly happen before July.  It is really tough to predict the timing on some sort of settlement with Meng or Huawei - so I think where the logic tree  goes after that I would pose as open ended questions (as I have no particular expertise here, and I\u2019m not a lawyer): - How independent is the DOJ from the White House in cases and negotiations like these?\n- Would the USA ever come to a settlement with Meng /separate from/ a broader settlement with Huawei?\n- If the USA instead returns Meng to China, how much leverage do they lose over Huawei?\n- What sort of wrongdoing would Huawei and Meng need to admit do? Just fraud? Violating Iran sanctions? Stealing American technology?\n- Would they agree to that?  Is it better to the alternative of denial of guilt and living in Vancouver?\n- Is this really the best \u2018front\u2019 of the USA - China relationship for Biden to try to de-escalate immediately?\n- If he did, especially so early in his administration, how would domestic media and opposing politicians react? What would be required for a settlement to be a \u2018win\u2019 politically? Huawei is really on the front lines of whether or not China is engaging in \u2018fair play\u2019 in global capitalism  - many many countries are opposing using Huawei hardware in new 5G networks due to national security concerns. All of which makes the path to a quick resolution a lot more murky. But it also could be announced in a week! Hah.  FYI - for reference, here are a couple other sources that are good content and have coloured my thoughts here: (1) Ray Dalio\u2019s writing on the overall China - USA long term relationship - chapter 7 specifically https://www.principles.com/the-changing-world-order/#chapter7 (2) Maclean\u2019s article about why negotiations are standard course https://www.macleans.ca/news/talk-of-a-deal-for-meng-wanzhou-raises-hope-and-a-lot-of-wishful-thinking/ To your specific question  about the statement by the VP - I agree, it does raise questions. The phrasing used about \u2018doing everything we can\u2019 is quite consistent with public statements by Trudeau over the past two years. My own overall analysis is more focused on the structural drivers of the situation, so I don\u2019t want to be swayed too much by something that could be simply the new administration and Trudeau helping each other gain political \u2018points\u2019 with the media. That said - in 2-3 months, if Meng is returned to China and the Michael\u2019s are released, I will definitely reflect back that I did not properly weigh this statement!

I am describing these areas in terms of \"what you 'need to believe' in order to predict that the two Michael's will NOT be released before July 15th 2021\" (1) There is no situation where China will release either Michael until Meng Whanzou is returned to China\n(2) Neither Canadian prosecutors nor the Biden Department of justice will agree to a Deferred Prosecution Agreement or otherwise decide to drop charges, prior to July 15th 2021\n(3) The current legal battle in the British Columbia court system will extend beyond July 15th 2021 - OR - the extradition process will result in Meng being sent to the USA Each of the areas above represent a 'layer' of uncertainty to this question - and is a complex situation.

My current train of thought here is that: (a) Meng Wanzhou was not arrested on some 'politicalized' charge by Trump - she/Huawei have been  under investigation for a decade - \"Counterintelligence agents and federal prosecutors began exploring possible cases against Huawei\u2019s leadership in 2010\" - https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/14/business/huawei-meng-hsbc-canada.html (b) Meng Wanzhou was arrested for lying to HSBC (fraud) surrounding Iran sanctions, but ultimately she is a person of interest for the USA because of extremely serious national security related charges. This is not a case that the USA can afford to take lightly! - \"American national security experts believe China has bolstered its economy \u2014 now the world\u2019s second largest \u2014 by stealing corporate, academic and military secrets. Among the concerns is that Chinese telecommunications equipment could be used to spy on American citizens. \" - Same NYT source as above (c) The way that China has engaged in 'hostage diplomacy' - i.e. detaining innocent Canadians in response to a legitimate 'rule of law' arrest of Meng is unacceptable to the international community, and has happened to other countries in the past (e.g. Australians) (d) 'Capitulating' to China  sets an extremely dangerous precedent for ALL Western/democratic countries. It shows China that 'if you detain our innocent civilians under fake charges, you can get what you want from us'. In fact, it ENCOURAGES more of the behaviour in the future.  (d - extra) EDIT: adding source from Trudeau here - \"This week, a group of prominent lawyers, former parliamentarians and diplomats wrote to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau imploring him to allow the Justice Minister to use his legislated power to unilaterally end Ms. Meng\u2019s extradition proceedings. ... Mr. Trudeau respectfully said he would not do that. He gave two reasons: Canada\u2019s justice system must remain free of foreign and domestic political pressure; and Canada cannot signal to China and other counties that \u201call they have to do to get leverage over the Canadian government is randomly arrest a couple of Canadians.\u201d - https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/editorials/article-justin-trudeau-says-he-cant-give-in-to-chinas-hostage-taking-hes/ (e) As such, a decision to politically over-rule the legal process of extradition is extremely short-sighted, and goes against all goals for democratic countries that try to promote the 'rule of law' (instead of authoritarian rule) (f) Biden's foreign policy approach of a 'Summit for Democracy' (collaborating as a unified front with democratic allies) clearly demonstrates how seriously he takes these issues (e) The WSJ report in December 2020 around DPA discussions is rumored to have been leaked by China as something CHINA is hoping for (or was proposing), and it is seen as an exceptionally rare and unlikely outcome (DPAs generally only apply to corporations, not individuals)  As a result, I see this as relatively low probability (<5%) that either Canadian or USA governments intervene in the court case before it has ended (3) This area is also a complicated, specialized area of the law, but there are a couple areas that make me think it is also a low probability (a) Dual criminality standard has already been reached - \"In May 2020, the British Columbia supreme court justice Heather Holmes ruled on Wednesday that the alleged actions of Meng would be considered a crime in Canada \u2013 a key condition for extradition to proceed.\" https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/27/huawei-meng-wanzhou-canada-court-ruling-us-extradition (b) The base rate of avoiding extradition to the USA is 1 in 100 - https://financialpost.com/technology/the-odds-of-huaweis-cfo-avoiding-u-s-extradition-are-just-one-in-100 (c) The case is set to proceed in the BC Supreme Court from early March until the end of April. AFTER THAT POINT, it can be appealed by the losing side to TWO additional levels of court - the BC Court of Appeals and then the Supreme Court of Canada. This is an extremely long process, and this assumption alone could extend the timeline by over a year. https://www.bccourts.ca/about_the_courts/ (d) Here is a summary on how the extradition process works. https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/cj-jp/emla-eej/extradition.html - It is currently in 'Phase 2 - Judicial'\t (e) \"By opening multiple legal fronts, Meng\u2019s team has all but ensured the tussle will last for years, with many experts believing the case is inevitably bound for the supreme court of Canada. \" - Same source as above, The Guardian As such, I am sticking with the base rate of 1% here, and my combined probabilities amount to less than 5-10% chance the Michaels are released before this date, sadly.

Based on this article https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/10/huawei-cfo-meng-wanzhou-extradition-trial-explained.html there are three phases involved in the trial. One starting January 20th, a second one for June, and a third potential phase in September. The only way these protracted legal proceedings are avoided are that the judge sides with Meng AND there is no appeal, in the January proceedings (focused on double criminality standard) or June proceedings focused on due process during her arrest. The base rate for 'avoiding extradition from Canada to USA' is that 1% of people accomplish this. As such, I am going with a strong 90% probability that the Meng case is not fully sorted out by July 15th. Implicitly I am also assuming that the Biden administration does not choose to drop the charges in his first 5 months as president (to avoid looking 'soft on China'), or finding some other technicality which would result in her release and then the subsequent release of the Michaels. I am not a legal expert though. I highly doubt the Canadian government would accept one of them being returned but not the other, but putting at 1% as it is not entirely impossible they are sent home in a staged fashion.
