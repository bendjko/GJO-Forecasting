Russia is in the very final stages of preparing for a war before our very eyes. In this age of cell phone cameras, publicly available high-resolution satellite images and publicly available flight tracking, we see the military buildup for ourselves. US and other intelligence has provided us information that the order to prepare for an invasion has been given, that a \"capture or kill\" list has been prepared for the entire country, and that Russia is planning an \"extremely violent\" invasion of Ukraine. We can see with our own eyes that it will be extremely violent, because, for example, certain types of missiles are being placed extremely close to the border, strongly suggesting that they will be used against cities, probably to commit war crimes, and they are bringing in tanks specially adapted for urban warfare. The Russian proxy forces in Donbas are working overtime in a so far completely unsuccessful attempt to provoke Ukrainian armed forces into responding, and failing that, they have been shelling their own region. The Russian media is stirring up the lies that Ukraine wants war and that its forces are committing \"genocide\" in Donbas, lined up against Russia, and conducting an offensive on Donbas. Putin has written that Ukraine should not be a separate country, wants to restore as much as he can of the former USSR, wants to shift the balance of power in Europe away from NATO and towards Russia, and wants to change the course of history. Putin has come forward with outrageous demands to which he knows the answer will be no, and has spent many hours in fruitless negotiations, with the goal of using that spectacle to further claim that he tried all he could, but the West left him no choice but to invade Ukraine to defend Russia. We even have a video of a prominent Russian MP, the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, from Dec 27, 2021, saying in the Duma, \"At 4am on 22 Feb [8pm ET on Feb 21] you'll feel [our new policy]. I'd like 2022 to be peaceful. But I love the truth, for 70 years I've said the truth. It won't be peaceful.

The US experience in Iraq comes to mind.  If he does in fact invade, what are Putin's plans for a counter insurgency?  One study says Russia would need 325,000 troops to suppress an insurrection. See this piece from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, https://www.csis.org/analysis/scenario-analysis-ukrainian-insurgency (you may have to scroll down to February 15 to find the article), and this article from understandingwar.org, https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Ukraine%20Invasion%20Forecast%20Series%20Part%202%20ISW%20CT%20December%202021.pdf. If Putin is truly a strategic thinker rather than merely a tactician he will have a counterinsurgency plan.  The more territory he takes the larger the required force to suppress an insurgency.  It is a given that the US and NATO allies are already working with Ukrainians to prepare an insurgency.  The objective will be making invasion as costly for Russia as possible.  For these reasons I believe a complete takeover of Ukraine is unlikely.  Dividing Ukraine into East and West along the Dnepr River is possible, but could still be very costly for Russia.  Taking only enough of Southeast Ukraine to create a land bridge to Crimea is another possible scenario. Putin has achieved quite a lot without invading.  Ukraine's economy has been weakened.  And while NATO has remained united, dependence on Russian oil and gas could cause divisions fairly soon.  Thus Putin may call an end to \"strategic exercises\" and declare victory.  I'll overweight that possibility, but only slightly.

This article talks about some items I have not seen elsewhere: Russia-Ukraine Warning Update: New Indicators of Imminent Russian Attack By Fredrick W. Kagan and Mason Clark February 18, 2022, 2:00 pm ET Russia may launch an attack on Ukraine on Saturday, February 19, 2022. The attack would likely begin with an air and missile campaign targeting much of Ukraine to decapitate the government and degrade the Ukrainian military as well as the ability of Ukrainian citizens to prepare to resist a subsequent Russian invasion. US and allied governments have been warning of such an attack for some days, pointing to the size of the Russian forces concentrated on Ukraine\u2019s borders.[1] Western officials have additionally said that Russian troops have moved to jumping-off positions for an invasion over the past 24 hours. The following additional conditions and indicators point to February 19 as an optimal date for a Russian attack: 1. Ukrainian President Volodymir Zelensky will be in Germany at the Munich Security Conference. He is scheduled to speak at 1530 Munich time.[2]  His absence from Ukraine will degrade his ability to coordinate a response to any Russian attack and create more propitious circumstances for a Russian-sponsored attempt at a coup d\u2019etat. \nRussian forces could close Ukrainian airspace to prevent Zelensky from returning to Kyiv.\n2. Russian President Vladimir Putin will reportedly oversee Russian nuclear drills on Saturday, February 19, as well.[3]Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko will accompany Putin. Those drills are being conducted out of the usual exercise cycle and are clearly intended to deter any Western response to an attack.\nPutin and Lukashenko will observe the exercises from an unspecified \u201csituational center\u201d in Moscow, likely the Russian Ministry of Defense\u2019s National Defense Control Center (NDCC). That would put them in the best position to oversee conventional military operations as well.\nLaunching the attack during those drills would take maximal advantage of their deterrent effect.\n3. Russian proxy provocations in eastern Ukraine have increased dramatically since February 16, including an artillery barrage that damaged a kindergarten in unoccupied Ukraine and multiple other proxy attacks.[4]  Russian proxies have increased the frequency and drama of their claims of Ukrainian attacks on them as well as their false claims that Ukraine is preparing to invade occupied Donbas.\nRussia\u2019s proxies in Donbas began evacuating civilians to Russia ahead of a claimed Ukrainian offensive.[5] \nRussian senior officials, including Putin, have been increasingly repeating and expanding on those claims this week.[6] \n4. The proxy campaign is likely intended on the one hand to draw Ukrainian forces into a response that Russia would then claim to be an attack and, on the other, to use false flag attacks and outright disinformation to fabricate justifications for a Russian attack to \u201cdefend\u201d \u201cRussian citizens\u201d in occupied Donbas. This rhetorical and kinetic activity has crossed thresholds pointing to the likelihood of an actual Russian attack. This update reflects a change to our assessments and forecasts. We have previously assessed that Putin was setting conditions to move Russian forces overtly into occupied Donbas and possibly conduct a limited invasion in unoccupied southeastern Ukraine and/or an air/missile campaign. We now assess that those Russian activities are extremely likely and imminent and that a much larger-scale Russian invasion is very possible.

The increase of disease and sickness among the soldiers with minimal basing capabilities will increase costs and reduce readiness. Russia has shown the Polish border with Belarus to be more strategically significant as demonstrated with through the alleged orchestration of the migrant crisis[3] As an additional factor, the world (in particular, the United States) has clearly shown the costs of an invasion of Ukraine to be prohibitive[4], but Russia has a history of not working overtly in denied areas (see Crimea)[5] and because of points listed above, Russia has already achieved significant strategic objectives including a strengthening of Soviet-era military dependence with Belarus.

A View From Belarus\nPublication: Eurasia Daily Monitor Volume: 19 Issue: 20\nBy: Grigory Ioffe\nFebruary 16, 2022 06:02 PM Age: 16 hours The showdown over Ukraine continues to keep experts guessing. On the one hand, warnings that the invasion could start at any time emanate from Washington. On the other hand, there are multiplying suggestions that such a development remains a low probability; this accumulating evidence comes mostly from Europe, including Ukraine\u2019s northern neighbor, Belarus. One such example originated directly from Belarusian President Alyaksandr Lukashenka, in his February 4 interview to leading Russian television showman Vladimir Solovyev. The latter asked, \u201cDo you see the probability of a large war in Europe? First with Ukraine, then with the rest of Europe?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d retorted Lukashenka. In his opinion, the West would not sacrifice its living comfort; and then \u201cbefore they turn around and send some troops here, we will already be at the English Channel; at that point, our shaggy friend [apparently referring to the United Kingdom\u2019s Prime Minister Boris Johnson] will cross the Channel on a schooner\u201d and raise his hands up in surrender. \u201cAnd they know this in advance,\u201d the Belarusian leader underscored (YouTube, February 5). Several days later, Josep Borrell, the European Union\u2019s chief diplomat, also expressed his utmost doubt that war was looming (Deutsche Welle\u2014Russian service, February 9). And pointedly, Belarusian Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei underscored on Wednesday (February 16) that \u201c[n]ot a single soldier, not a single piece of military equipment from the Russian Federation\u201d will stay behind in Belarus after the conclusion of their joint Allied Resolve 2022 exercises, scheduled to end on February 20 (TASS, February 16). \u201cIt looks very much like the Kremlin and Washington are waging an unspoken, coordinated campaign to pressure [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy into complying with the so-called Minsk agreements. The United States is playing the role of a [\u2026] provocateur, inflating hysteria around a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine, and Russia\u2019s role is to create a picture that confirms [\u2026] the possibility of a military conflict,\u201d wrote Arseny Sivitsky of the Minsk-based Center for Strategic and Foreign Policy Research (For Strategy, February 2). Artyom Shraibman, a non-resident scholar with the Carnegie Institute for International Peace, shared a similar idea. In an interview with the Belarusian Service of Radio Liberty, he observed that \u201cif Zelenskyy had changed his position on the Minsk agreements in response to pressure from Paris or Berlin, he would have been devoured by political opponents. It would be a shameful surrender under pressure\u2026 But it is a different thing to do this against the backdrop of Russian troops at the border.\u201d Shraibman also thinks that those troops will leave the territory of Belarus no later than one week following the end of the ongoing Russian-Belarusian drills (Svaboda.org, February 10). Yet another non-resident scholar at Carnegie, Andrei Movchan, cites a February 9 report by the Swedish Center for Russian Studies, which suggests that Russian forces based near the border with Ukraine do not include special logistics or electronic warfare and engineering units, and that few units of the Russian air force are there. These and other considerations make invasion unlikely (Facebook.com/andrei.movchan, February 10). One recurring factor giving additional credence to the low-probability-of-war thesis is \u0421hina. Late last year, as a result of a dispute between Kyiv and Warsaw over trucking permits, Ukrainian Railways introduced a ban on the transportation of goods from Russia, Kazakhstan, China and other countries to Poland, effective December 1, 2021 (RailFreight.com, February 1). Two days later, the restrictions were lifted for the transport of coal from Russia. As of early February, those restrictions have been canceled altogether. According to Zbigniew Tracichleb, who presides over Polish Railway Lines (PKP), that decision had everything to do with transit to and from China\u2014that is, to the investment surge related to China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (Polskie Radio, February 10). Definitely not by accident, Ukraine\u2019s decision to reopen its rail network to cargo trains from China coincided with news of a pending Chinese investment into a large logistical center in Poland (Business Insider\u2014Polish service, February 2) and with the launching of the modernization project of the M1 highway in Belarus worth $2 billion\u20132.5 billion (Sputnik.by, February 9). It is unlikely that China would make all these regional investment decisions under the threat of imminent war in neighboring Ukraine. Contacts with Russian leadership apparently have not compelled the Chinese to change their mind. Finally, a recent phone call by General Mark Milley, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the US Armed Forces, to Belarus\u2019s Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces Major General Viktor Gulevich (Mil.by, February 10) is hardly a sign of imminent war either. Regardless of the content of the conversation, one can interpret the call as the US paying respect to Belarus\u2019s sovereignty. Moreover, Belarus promptly responded to a request from Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia to explain the military activity on its territory and provided answers within the framework of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\u2019s (OSCE) 2011 Vienna Document. Minsk\u2019s official response claims that the total number of troops and weapons participating in the current Allied Resolve exercise does not exceed the notification thresholds set by that document. The response also pointedly notes that all Russian military units are to leave the territory of Belarus after the exercise, and \u201cthe order for the withdrawal of troops is in the process of coordination.\u201d According to the Belarusian authorities, they provided sufficient information about the drills and invited observers and media outlets from 17 countries. The respective invitations to all three Baltic States were sent on February 9 (Svaboda.org, February 11). In summary, as viewed from Belarus, there are at least as many signs that there will be no war as there are to suggest that large-scale hostilities are inevitable. https://jamestown.org/program/will-there-be-war-a-view-from-belarus/"], [99943, "2022-02-17T15:24:20Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], "Bill Browder: \"Russian government operatives just bombed a kindergarten in Eastern Ukraine.

Let's look at probabilities for this development, which may lead to invading Luhansk and Donetsk. There are several scenarios of destabilizing the situation that can lead to Russian troops entering these areas if Putin to follow up on Duma's suggestion - \"following the will of the People\" in the next 3.5 months. This will be a break from the current policy of keeping these enclaves under control, but officially under Ukraine sovereignty (very convenient as this prevents Ukraine from entering NATO). These republics are \"mafia states\", with local militia's controlling and/or businesses (Donetsk more than Luhansk). Duma gave Putin another tool to put pressure on Ukraine to follow Minsk agreements. But Ukraine does NOT want to follow these agreements and may get a sigh of relief by letting these self-proclaimed republics to go under pretense it was forced by Russia. Will Putin follow 'the will of the People\"? I'd put this probability at, let's say 70% as it does not cost Russia much - these areas are already supported by Russian money. And clearly Minsk agreements are no starter for Ukrainian government. This can provoke some reaction from Ukraine though - should they just stand by idly when these self-proclaimed republics secede? But what Ukrainians can do? Invade with a mass of Russian troops at the border, risking a war? Before I assigned 0 to this probability, even considering probability of some crazy Ukrainian right-wing nationalists trying to provoke war. But this development may move the dial even so slightly - let's say, 15% of Ukrainians (regular or irregular paramilitary) trying to invade. Now, will the militias on the other side, equipped and supported by Russians deal with Ukrainians by themselves or they will need Russian help? I do not think the Ukrainian government will risk the invasion at the beginning (probability of that is negligible)- so it will be nationalist paramilitary (some of them can be part of regular Ukrainian military). They will be repelled by just Luhansk and Donetsk militias (90%, 10% Russians helping), with losses on both sides, which THEN may force Ukrainian government to intervene with force, quite high probability (90%?). Unfortunately, Ukraine is unstable, full of arms and paramilitary groups, that may force the government to do so. THIS most probably will lead for Russians to enter (close to 100%) \u2013 they are there at least for this development. Total probability for Russians to enter is 11% by my calculations.

The size of the withdrawal remains unclear and may involve only a fraction of Russia\u2019s forces at the Ukrainian border, which western officials estimate at more than 60% of the country\u2019s ground forces. [...] \u201cUnits of the southern and western military districts, which have accomplished their missions, are boarding trains and trucks and will head for their garrisons later today,\u201d [defence ministry spokesperson Igor] Konashenkov said in the statement. The defence ministry also released a video of Russian tanks and other heavy weaponry being loaded on to railway cars, the Interfax news service reported. That footage appeared to have been shot in Crimea. \u201cMany statements are constantly being made from [Russia], so we have a rule: we\u2019ll believe it when we see it,\u201d said Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister. \u201cIf we see the withdrawal, then we will believe in de-escalation.\u201d [...] Russia\u2019s rouble currency reportedly posted gains following the announcement, indicating that investors hoped this would mark the beginning of a de-escalation of tensions between Russia and the west. [...] Rob Lee, a senior fellow in the Foreign Policy Research Institute\u2019s Eurasia Program, wrote that the announcement of a drawdown was \u201cpotentially good news, but we should wait to see where the Eastern and Central Military District goes, especially after Feb 20.\u201d Those forces, which are garrisoned thousands of miles from the Ukrainian border, represented a considerable portion of the additional military power deployed to the region. \u201cAs long as that remains nearby, Russia will have the capacity to conduct a significant escalation, though possibly not on as short notice,\u201d he wrote.\n------------------ To be honest, I first noticed a (sometimes dramatic) drop in the probabilities of YES in the current status of other forecasting platforms (last posted snapshot here: https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1397632 ) - currently Metaculus is -22% and Hypermind at -28% from yesterday; GJ supers at -2% .

Shortly thereafter Sergei Shoigu, the defence minister, said that some of Russia\u2019s military exercises had ended and others were close to completion. Meanwhile in Kyiv, Ukraine\u2019s capital, there was another sign of possible diplomatic movement. Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, said that Ukraine\u2019s membership of NATO was in practice off the table.

The increase of disease and sickness among the soldiers with minimal basing capabilities will increase costs and reduce readiness. Russia has shown the Polish border with Belarus to be more strategically significant as demonstrated with through the alleged orchestration of the migrant crisis[3] As an additional factor, the world (in particular, the United States) has clearly shown the costs of an invasion of Ukraine to be prohibitive[4], but Russia has a history of not working overtly in denied areas (see Crimea)[5] and because of points listed above, Russia has already achieved significant strategic objectives including a strengthening of Soviet-era military dependence with Belarus.

We previously discussed the possibility of the Russian Armed Forces near the borders of Ukraine swelling to 160,000, but currently the total number does not exceed 150,000. At present, the accumulated forces on the border are insufficient for a large-scale operation aimed at capturing all or a significant part of Ukraine. Therefore, predictions about the probability of such scenarios in the near future cannot be confirmed. Moreover, we believe that such scenarios are unlikely in the foreseeable future due to the factors we have described in our previous article (https://kyivindependent.com/national/center-for-defense-strategies-how-probable-is-large-scale-war-in-ukraine-analysis/ ). In short, there is currently no active action in Russia to prepare the hundreds of thousands of troops needed for such a large-scale offensive. At the moment, there are also no significant measures to create strategic reserves and mobilization on the basis of the Russian army\u2019s centers for mobilization deployment. In addition, such an operation will have extremely negative consequences for Russia. If the formula for a failed attack on Ukraine includes non-military components, international isolation and sanctions, the outcome of such an operation will be catastrophic for all of Russia, not just the Kremlin. We also believe that most local scenarios to capture separate cities and territories are unlikely due to a lack of political expediency. At the same time, some hostilities in certain areas are possible in order to distract Ukraine\u2019s defense forces. We continue to believe that the scenarios of massive bombing and missile strikes, which could lead to large-scale civilian casualties, are *unrealistic*. Such actions could thwart Russia\u2019s political leadership\u2019s plans to win the \u201chearts and minds\u201d of Ukraine\u2019s Russian-speaking population. As a result, even his few sympathizers may lose their desire for hypothetical support for Putin in Ukraine. However, individual missile and air strikes on military or infrastructure facilities are possible only as a means of supporting ground operations or as a means of psychological pressure. At the same time, the Kremlin\u2019s attempt to organize a trigger event \u2013 a planned provocation, for example, in eastern Ukraine \u2013 remains plausible. The purpose of these actions is to legitimize the entry of Russian troops into the territory of Ukraine or an armed escalation on the front line. In general, the aggravation in eastern Ukraine is *highly probable*. Scenarios of various kinds of hybrid invasion without a military component remain high in many areas due to misinformation, political turmoil, undermining of trust and physical actions \u2013 terrorist attacks, sabotage operations, cyber attacks on critical infrastructure. Overall, we believe that the general assessment of the scenarios has not changed compared to our assessment three and two weeks ago. A separate question is the likelihood of a potential attack on Kyiv. We will address this issue below, after assessing the situation in our seas. [...] RATIONALE FOR THE STATEMENTS OF WORLD LEADERS [...] Let us not forget that we are in a state of hybrid warfare, in which information narratives are part of an attack or defense. Obviously, our Western partners see the disclosure of information about the intentions of the Russian leadership as an opportunity for pressure and restraint: we know about your plans and are preparing for them.\n------------------------ \"Main Russian weekly news programme has stepped up rhetoric a bit. \u201cUkraine ready to kill again\u201d; \u201cWest creating Cordon sanitaire to cut off Rus from Eur\u201d.

(at this exact point in time)\n2. is he testing Biden?\n3. is he seeking to divide NATO, knowing that the European reaction would diverge from that of the US? If it is either #2 or #3 (could well be), our discussion ends here. But let's assume that it's actually #1. Hence:\n1. the last time the Russians conducted a such a complex war that ended successfully was Germany 1945 (which was 76 years ago)\n2. the Ukrainians are not the pushovers that they were in 2014.

The Russians are not going to be able to take Ukraine as easily as predicted. In fact, any potential full-scale invasion is going to be a bloodbath. Ukraine will likely ask for external assistance. At that point, if the US just sits on the sidelines of a full-scale takeover of a NATO partner country, its already-lowered credibility (with the fall of Kabul) would fall even lower. There are already 80,000 US troops in Europe. I don't think the US is moving ~4700 more troops to Poland (as of date) so that they oversee an orderly Russian invasion.

I still believe that US/UK leaks of Russian plans have thrown Putin and his regime for a loop, which may delay invasion (or even prevent one). I doubt we will see an invasion on Wednesday for this reason. If everybody, including his own citizens, thinks it will be Wednesday, then if I were Putin I\u2019d move the date to some other day to make it appear less pre-meditated.

I believe he wants to go into the history books for having regained lost territory of the Russian Empire. Nearly all signs are pointing to imminent invasion imo, including the following:\n* the failure of diplomacy to yield substantial results to date\n* ongoing Russian military preparations on a scale not seen since WWII, including taking up positions in final staging areas close to the Ukrainian border; for but a few examples among zillions, see the following: \n https://twitter.com/bjaninemorison/status/1492639622874091521 (with link to an article in The Economist)\n https://twitter.com/CBCNews/status/1492529010777239556 (with link to CBC News article)\n https://twitter.com/Angry_Staffer/status/1492866479640961024\n https://twitter.com/ELINTNews/status/1492485170204717056\n https://twitter.com/KofmanMichael/status/1492484145884409856\n* Western military preparations and other contingency planning, e.g., related to securing supplies of LNG for European countries\n* increasing numbers of cyberattacks by Russia - and also false bomb threats in Ukraine\n* multiple countries moving their embassy functions out of Kyiv and telling their citizens to leave Ukraine, and at least the US pulling its troops out of Ukraine\n* Poland opening its borders to US citizens leaving Ukraine, without requiring advance approval\n* at least one major airline (KLM) ceasing to fly into or above Ukraine, and major insurance companies informing Ukrainian airlines that they will no longer cover flights over Ukraine starting a couple days from now\n* all the Western intelligence that keeps coming out\n* Putin even moving his yacht out of reach One argument for why Russia isn't likely to invade Ukraine is that the many costs of sanctions will be sufficient deterrent to prevent an invasion. I don't think sanctions will be close to enough to stop someone bent on changing the course of history. I think Putin is thinking in terms of a decades-long plan to reverse at least some of Russia's losses when the USSR collapsed, not just tweaking the status quo to make himself and his friends 2% wealthier. I believe that the current situation is first and foremost about power and history to Putin, not money. One could argue that Putin needs his oligarchs to get richer for him to remain in power, but I think it's likely that he has alternate plans for them and has likely persuaded at least some of them with promises for the future, such as dividing up the spoils of war. Or, he may plan to risk it anyway. Putin always likes to have all his ducks in a row, and I am sure he has game-planned everything out to an extreme in his mental version of the universe. Another argument against an invasion is that the current buildup is a bluff to gain concessions through diplomacy. If that's the case, it's an extraordinarily realistic bluff, down to every last detail. And, it has yielded almost zero in the way of concessions; Putin probably could have gotten similar offers for arms control negotiations if he had just picked up the phone. Moreover, it has strengthened NATO resolve and cohesion and will likely lead to more deployment of NATO and NATO member troops and materiel near Russian borders in the long term. Diplomatically, to me, the whole episode looks like a net negative to date. Ultimately, this forecast comes down to one's assessment of Putin's goals, worldview, and assessment of the situation, and to one's assessment of the available facts and news items. If one doesn't think Putin's goals include recapturing territory once controlled by Russia, fundamentally  -- not incrementally -- changing the balance of power in Europe, or changing the course of history, then perhaps an invasion might not have looked as likely during this military buildup. However, the facts on the ground are increasingly reaching a point where it is hard to see any outcome other than an invasion. And now, reports are coming out that US intelligence suggests that an invasion could start as early as Wednesday: \"US intelligence briefings to NATO allies reportedly \"very detailed and well-sourced\" including \"concrete invasion routes and tasks of specific Russian units.\" The attack \"could come as early as Wednesday.\"\"\nhttps://twitter.com/tobiaschneider/status/1492245414761971712"], [86607, "2022-02-13T15:36:05Z", [0.02, 0.0, 0.38, 0.6], "Current thoughts regarding insinuations from US that invasion is in the next week\n1.

Putin himself is a former KGB guy who surrounds himself with other former KGB guys and other people who grew up in the USSR. After the USSR collapsed, Russia had to go through a period of economic and political recovery, but it has regained its strength and ambition. Russia has amassed a fortune from oil and gas and other projects; Russia is the 5th largest economy in Europe and the 11th largest in the world. And it has modernized its military. Putin has dreamed for decades of restoring Russian power. The Cold War may have ended, but it got replaced with a new rivalry with Russia, and Putin seems determined to increase Russian power in Europe. They have laid the groundwork for years: conducting massive disinformation campaigns to weaken the West; building one of the world's top offensive and defensive cyber capabilities; building a very modern military, including modern EW capabilities, anti-satellite capabilities, hypersonic missiles and drones (although they're perhaps a bit behind in UAV capabilities); hanging out around undersea cables all around the world, probably mapping them out and developing plans for cutting them in different war-gaming scenarios; practicing building up the military around Ukraine in preparation for a real invasion (so much so that many seem to be used to the idea of Russian troops around Ukraine, view it as a policy tool, and do not think invasion is likely); and the list goes on and on.

Biden is reportedly set to speak with Pres. Putin on the phone tomorrow, Saturday, and the call was requested by the White House. Wouldn't think Biden is calling to make any concessions but to remind Putin of the consequences, or how badly it can get. \nThere's been a lot of talk about what would be the minimum concessions Putin would accept to de-escalate and no one seems to be able to guess but the consequences to Russia are clear and many think Putin will not move forward given the economic consequences and the costs of a full scale invasion. Given the actual question and the possibilities of what would constitute an invasion, I still think Putin will move forward even if it is not full scale. So I increased the probability of a more limited military intervention. \nThere's a lot of buzz about Russia not having the forces necessary for a full scale invasion with is ~130,000-150,000 troops stationed across the border at different points -- unless he is planning a more aerial attack and then a quick invasion to overthrow the government.  I think at this point, a retreat, without getting major concessions handed on a platter, which I don't think it's going to happen, is not something Putin would do given his long term plans for Russia and the region. It would affect his leadership and credibility. \nIf Putin goes for a \"minor incursion\" he'd still have created enough chaos and the optics he may be seeking and at the same time, he'd be retreating, temporarily, but also walking away with new economic and political alliances and deals made around this crisis which can be very useful in the future in accomplishing his stated goals but also in positioning Russia in a way that would make it less vulnerable to effect of sanctions. \nOne only has to see the parade of nations he has displayed and the deals he has promised which have the making of \"sell your soul to the devil\" Russia also got the political and economic backing of China and their joint statement made public last week it's a pretty clear map not just of their relationship but of their long term goals. Putin will emerge stronger and better positioned out of this crisis, he set up the board to walk out winning in several types of scenarios. He may not be able to afford a full scale invasion and the consequences of it but the probability he will push the line just enough, go in for a minor incursion (comparatively, something like a take over of Donetsk, Luhansk) then retreat I think are not small. Russia can walk away saying, we told you we had no plans to invade, we're just helping out in this area, then shame the US and NATO for overreacting or faulty intelligence.\n- One last observation, from how I see it, there was a visible switch in Putin at the moment he decided to arrest Navalny and throw him in prison. I think that was indicative that he is moving forward with his expansion goals and it's not wasting time.

Russia has shown the Polish border with Belarus to be more strategically significant as demonstrated with through the alleged orchestration of the migrant crisis[3] As an additional factor, the world (in particular, the United States) has clearly shown the costs of an invasion of Ukraine to be prohibitive[4], but Russia has a history of not working overtly in denied areas (see Crimea)[5] and because of points listed above, Russia has already achieved significant strategic objectives including a strengthening of Soviet-era military dependence with Belarus. Predicting a 3% chance that a NATO member state will accuse Russian national military forces of invading Donetsk/Luhansk: The chance of a Russian national military force invasion of Donetsk and Luhansk is slim because time has shown the approach with separatist forces has not worked - there is little evidence that a nationalized militant approach would achieve anything further.[6] If anything, the Kremlin would support or employ the separatists which avoid accountability.

Instead he is signaling \"meet my demands or I will invade\" by making obvious and massive preparations for an invasion. If he was dead set on invasion, we would have not had such a gradual build up, where almost a year after the original April 2021 troop buildup we are still only at 70% needed for a full invasion, with forces still increasing. Forces would have built up quite quickly and then attacked. I am convinced as Macron is and other observers that Putin wants to redraw the security structure in eastern Europe in a way that constrains NATO and leaves Ukraine in the Russian sphere of influence, but is not set on war. War may come if NATO continues to guarantee an open door policy to Ukraine. Optimistic scenario: France successfully negotiates some form of deal with Russia.

I believe it's going to happen for several reasons, the exact combination of which only Putin knows. I believe it'll happen because:\n* Putin wants to rebuild the Russian empire;\n* Putin is getting older and wants to have a lasting legacy; \n* Putin thinks the Soviet Union should never have been disbanded; \n* Putin believes that some or all of Ukraine is rightfully part of Russia; \n* Putin wants to control a buffer zone between Russia and NATO countries;\n* Putin is concerned that NATO weapons will increasingly be placed in countries adjacent to Russia; \n* Putin specifically doesn't want short-range and medium-range missiles in Ukraine (even though he has nuclear weapons and nuclear-capable Iskander missiles in Kaliningrad, and may soon put nuclear missiles in Belarus) and thinks that he must act now or it will soon be too late;\n* Putin wants a Russian sphere of influence between Russia and NATO countries, and he doesn't want a pro-Western state in Ukraine because he feels it undermines Russia;\n* Putin doesn't want any former Soviet republic ever again to have a close relationship with NATO (i.e., membership or the placement of NATO weapons or advisors), and so Ukraine will serve as an example of what happens if one gets too close;\n* Putin feels threatened by having a democracy in Ukraine and doesn't want it to exist as an example; \n* Putin doesn't want to lose control of Donbas;\n* Putin thinks the time is right because Europe is dependent on Russian gas, and the US is embroiled in internal controversies;\n* Putin thinks the time is right because he recently (~18 months ago) got control over Belarus and now has a launching pad for a northern invasion, and he has been practicing and gearing up for an invasion ever since;\n* Putin wants to weaken European and N American cohesion, both within and between countries; and\n* Putin thinks his goals in Ukraine are achievable and will incur minimal military costs.\nI'm sure some of these are more important than others, and I'm sure I've missed some. Almost everything is in place militarily, down to the very last details. Russia has the smallest force contingent deployed in is eastern regions in decades, as the vast majority of its military resources are concentrated around Ukraine. We know of a planned false flag operation, plans for a staged video, an impossible set of demands for NATO countries, attempts to recruit members of the Ukraine Parliament to hand the government over to Russia upon invasion, and a complete plan for installing a puppet government. The Russian people are being told that the US and the West are pushing Russia into war, and that most of the eastern half of Ukraine is historically part of Russia. Disinformation and cyberattacks are ramped up. I'm not sure what will happen after Russian forces invade Ukraine. I'm sure that Putin's goal is to install a puppet government in Kyiv and for Russian forces eventually to withdraw once the situation is stable. I'm not completely sure which direction(s) the invasion will come from first. Probably Donbas and/or Crimea, followed by a push to take the entire southeast from Odesa to Kharkiv. It will all probably start with aerial bombardments. I believe many here (and elsewhere) think that Russia won't invade Ukraine because the costs will be too high, both militarily and financially, and for other reasons. I agree that the costs will be enormous. But such costs haven't stopped previous aggressors, and I don't think they'll stop Putin. Moreover, Putin may well underestimate the military costs, much like the US underestimated the military costs of the Iraqi invasion and how difficult it would be to achieve its goals there. I think what's about to happen is incredibly sad and tragic. People will suffer. It makes me very sad to think about. As always, I hope I am wrong.

It looks like the Russian delegation isn't staying to watch the Olympics.  The third plane, RSD035 (registration RA-64059), went from Moscow to Beijing on Feb 3, landing just after midnight on Feb 4, then flew to Vladivostok (because why not? When you're that close!), then back to Beijing, then from Beijing to Moscow. RSD035 arrived in Beijing more than 12 hours before the other 2 planes and left a few hours afterwards. Security detail? (Other special Russian planes also flew to Beijing earlier, as well.) News reports indicate that Putin arrived in Beijing around 3pm Beijing time on Feb 4. RSD177 landed in Bejing around 2pm Feb 4 local time, and RSD137 landed in Beijing around 3pm Feb 4 local time. RSD177 left Beijing at 11:11pm Feb 4 Beijing time, and RSD177 left Beijing at 11:47pm Feb 4 Beijing time. Flightradar24.com shows RSD137 recently landed near Sochi, on Feb 5 at 3:53am local time, but RSD177 disappeared from flightradar24.com right next to Sochi. That could have been Putin's plane. It was on the same path as RSD137 and a little bit ahead of it. But RSD177 turned off tracking when it was on a clear descent to Sochi, at about 12,000 ft. Did it actually land at Sochi? There are 2 airplanes at the Sochi airport right now with no callsign, and we know that RA-96021 (RSD137) is there, so I'd bet that RA-96022 (RSD177) is also there.

The plan builds on the recent disinformation barrage by Moscow accusing Ukrainians of genocide. While the planned video\u2014using real corpses, actors as mourners, faked Ukrainian military equipment\u2014sounds crazy, American officials think it might have worked. And they hope blowing the whistle will stop the plan in its tracks. Russia, the officials said, intended to use the video to accuse Ukraine of \u201cgenocide\u201d against Russian-speaking people. It would then use the report to justify an attack or have separatist leaders in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine invite a Russian intervention. Officials would not release any direct evidence of the Russian plan or how they learned of it, saying to do so would compromise their sources and methods. But both the recent disinformation campaign focused on false accusations of genocide and recent the political actions being taken in the Russian parliament lend credence to the intelligence. Avril D. Haines, the director of National Intelligence, and other top administration officials briefed members of Congress on the material on Thursday.

They spent some time going back and forth west of Donbas, back and forth roughly along a line from Poltova to Konotop near the northeast border, and back and forth along a line from Konotop in the northeast to Zhytomyr, west of Kyiv, south of the eastern half of the border with Belarus and of a little bit of the northern border with Russia. It looks strongly like they were checking out the Ukrainian border from the eastern half of the border with Belarus, east to the border with Russia, and all the way around and down to the the Sea of Azov, where they were probably primarily checking out Russian activities around Donbas and Rostov-on-Don. It is interesting that they spent almost as much time looking in the northeast as they did around Donbas, even though there's a much larger number of troops currently positioned near Donbas. They were also clearly concerned about the border with Belarus directly north of Kyiv rather than the border area farther west, which they didn't surveil at all. They also didn't look at Crimea much; they traveled once north of Crimea, and it looks like that was just on their way to or from Donbas.

Twitter thread and link to article in Foreign Policy. Here's the twitter thread:\n\"US, NATO & Russia have not moved closer to a diplomatic solution. This Russian military buildup is unprecedented and even includes Belarus. A massive offensive is coming. How could this play out? Read my full take w/ @DomCruzBus: https://foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2022-01-21/day-after-russia-attacks 1/\nThere are many possible scenarios. Something short of an offensive might include recognition or annexation of the occupied Donbas. In a limited operation, Russia could seize more of the Donbas & major cities like Mariupol or Odessa, and establish a \u201cland bridge\u201d to Crimea. 2/\nBut these options would be unlikely to force diplomatic capitulation. They would entail costly urban warfare & long-term occupation of Ukr w/ insurgency. The Kremlin wouldn\u2019t regain influence or control over Ukr domestic & foreign policy, and Ukr wouldn\u2019t become a failed state.3/\nA likely scenario is combined land, air, and sea power striking from all axes of attack. Long-range fire capabilities would target decision-making organs, critical infrastructure, and morale targets. Rus troops in Belarus would threaten Kyiv and hasten capitulation. 4/\nRather than occupation or establishing a puppet state, the goal would be punitive strikes to annihilate Ukr military capabilities & paralyze the government, then withdraw upon favorable settlement or sufficient punishment. Ukraine & West would have to pick up the pieces. 5/\nWhat can the US do? Deliver on the unprecedented consequences that the Biden administration has promised. Rally bipartisan support for @SenatorMenendez Defending Ukrainian Sovereignty Act. Add new measures to target the wealth of Putin\u2019s circle of kleptocrats. 6/\nContinue expediting US-made arms transfers from allies. Join the UK, publicly airlift military equipment to Ukraine. Consider advanced capabilities which could still have initial operational capability. Provide real-time intelligence to Ukraine. Support a potential insurgency. 7/\nDeploy additional EFPs along the eastern flank to reassure NATO allies. Engage w/ Sweden and Finland. Prepare to open humanitarian corridors to accommodate refugee flows from an expanded conflict. Plan on burden sharing to assist asylum seekers in US, UK, and EU. 8/\nUS must still be careful to avoid a bilateral military confrontation with Russia, but the Kremlin\u2019s attempts to dismantle European security and roll back international treaties & agreements cannot go unpunished. 9/\nBottom line: There's still more to do to at least try to preempt another major theater war in Europe. Even if there are doubts about the offensive, given the seismic geopolitical shockwaves of war, prudence dictate more action to prevent, prepare, & respond to RUS aggression. 10/\nhttps://twitter.com/AVindman/status/1484548434904457222"], [484, "2022-01-29T18:43:59Z", [0.45, 0.05, 0.35, 0.15], "(no change) A VERY good discussion about post 1989 developments.

They have agreed to talks 2 weeks from now, but I think the invasion will probably have started before then. I think it could start any day now. \"We promise not to invade for the next 2 weeks\" seems like a perfect thing to say just to keep everyone a little off guard, while they go ahead and invade anyway on some pretext. The US government clearly isn't fooled, as various members of the government keep saying an invasion could happen any time now, and the embassy in Kyiv is asking people to get out now. Or, they could possibly hold talks and then start an invasion. They'll do whatever they see is to their strategic advantage most, whether that's invading now or after their meeting in 2 weeks. I'm sure that part of W European leaders' goal of holding talks 2 weeks from now rather than 2 days from now is to drag out the process into warmer weather, when it'll be harder to invade with tanks, but Russia doesn't care about their timetables. \"The Ukraine war, if it comes, won\u2019t be short....

The real threat of the west comes from its soft power, and the attraction it may hold to Russian citizens to demand a different kind of society. This threatens his regime and his personal personal safety, and his own vision for Russia. If Ukraine really becomes part of the West and a democratic and prosperous society, it will cripple the foundations of Putin's regime and his legacy. I believe Putin seeks to prevent a successful Ukraine either by destabilizing it, ruining its economy or invasion and occupation of all or parts of it.\n+ Russia is making all the preparation you'd expect for invasion\n+ Russia has made completely unrealistic demands on the USA and NATO, which indicates a desire for war or unrealistic Russian expectations. Which make war and invasion more likely. \n+ Ukraine is getting stronger and the best moment to strike might be now. \n+ Russia can afford it to ride out the sanctions\n+ invasion might be the one sure move Putin can make to ensure Ukraine does not prosper. \nI'm going with the baseline of that Russia will invade.  - All the moves Russia has made could be moves to sow divisions within NATO, destabilize Ukraine or get something else in negotiations. \n- Putin has always made carefully calculated military moves with limited risks. Invading is a much more risky move and not in character. \n- The Russian army would likely crush the Ukrainian army, but might suffer heavy losses itself. Not sure this is what the Russians expect though as the Russian regime may have convinced itself thing will be easy. \n- Occupying Ukraine, or large parts of it will likely result in the need for a significant occupational force, result in costly guerrilla attacks and might drain Russian treasury for the foreseeable future.. \n- An invasion of Ukraine is more likely to significantly weaken Russia and strengthen NATO\n- if things don't go well, it could end Putin's regime. \n- while the timing might be good now and the outlook bad,  Russia does not have to act now. invading the Donetsk and/or Luhansk Oblasts only. \nThis would be the minimal move. Not sure why Putin would do this unless he can inflict a significant battlefield defeat on Ukraine and destabilize it this way. This seems insufficient  I think this is not very likely unless it's a first calculated move to test the waters.

And as @isthisaforecast says, Putin has long considered Ukraine part of Russia: https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1385722 * This is a manufactured crisis. Putin has made this all about NATO, but there's absolutely no urgent situation with Ukraine and NATO. Ukraine doesn't even have an invitation with a timeline for joining NATO. NATO countries probably don't even want Ukraine to join, because they don't want to get embroiled in a war with Russia over it, but they can't say that, and Russia knows it. Putin wants to make unrealistic demands so that he can have a pretext for invasion when NATO countries say no. As I wrote in another comment, it all boils down to, \"Promise you'll never protect Ukraine if we invade it, or we'll invade it.\" It's heads we win, tails you lose. https://twitter.com/InTheLionsDen_/status/1483171136351395842 Everything is pointing to war, and has been at least since early Dec.

This is far beyond brinksmanship, imo. For an interesting, brief discussion of what could be next, see the FT article in the first link. Possibilities include \"seizing as much as two-thirds of Ukraine's territory,\" \"regime change and then a settlement,\" \"destabili[zing] Ukraine with paramilitary attacks, hybrid actions and cyber attacks,\" and \"devastating air strikes.\" Finally, there's the question of timing. Tanks and troops prefer frozen ground to spring mud. Here's a weather forecast calendar for Donetsk: https://weather.com/weather/monthly/l/09967a3efc295696927d2dfb04bfa3158dd01196d1224dd072bc6874666002c1\nThey've had somewhat warm weather for January, even into the 40's; high temperatures just below freezing are forecast through Friday, Feb. 4. Ideally, even colder temperatures would be great, but below freezing is good enough. On average, temperatures in Donetsk are very similar in January and early February, with highs of 28F and 30F, and lows of 17F and 18F, for Jan 1 and Feb 1, respectively: https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=weather+averages+donetsk+ukraine+february\nBut soon, temperatures will rise. So they really have a 2-3 week window for an invasion. I don't understand why they have waited this long; perhaps the plan is to use the weather to their advantage, by invading with good, cold weather, and preventing some effective resistance through the arrival of mud? And one more thing is worth addressing: Russia's repeated statements that they have absolutely no plan to invade Ukraine. We've seen this movie before.  First off, Russia has made vague threats about what will happen if their demands aren't met. I have no doubt that a pretext will quickly be found at the right juncture, and the choice to invade will be portrayed as being forced on them by intransigent, aggressive NATO countries. Update: \n\"Jan 21 (Reuters) - Here is a snapshot of what to look out for next in the Ukraine crisis after the latest U.S.-Russia talks produced - as expected - no breakthrough.\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. side would respond in writing next week to a set of security proposals that Russia presented in December, including a demand to bar Ukraine from ever joining NATO. A formal U.S. rejection could provide Russia with a pretext to move ahead with the unspecified military response it has threatened.

He is basically saying that he does not buy his intelligence and thinks Putin has to invade (to save face). At the same time he insinuated, that he has doubts that their would be a unified reaction by NATO regardless of the scope of the invasion. He basically admits that a small scale invasion would probably lead to less severe consequences. This is an intelligence leak telling the Russians, that the Americans have low confidence in their own strategy at the highest level. This should increase credence in favor of both a large and a small scale invasion, but disproportionately in favor of the small option. The question is by how much. Biden has been a loose cannon for a while and is increasingly perceived as less and less in control due to his age/ diminishing faculties. His press secretary was quick to mop up behind him reiterating the official line. What weight will Russia attribute to his words compared to the messages coming out of his staff? I think they will probably read it as a Biden-gaffe/unintentional slip-up just like his infrastructure fiasco. So they will regard it as a spill of genuine information rather than a complete misunderstanding of the situation on Biden's part. I assign 67% to that possibility (Genuine Spill). How will this information affect Russia's calculus? Basically invasion just became cheaper but a small scale invasion became much cheaper. So P(Large Invasion|Genuine Spill)=P(Large Invasion)+5%, P(Small Invasion|Genuine Spill)=P(Small Invasion)+10%. Then, there was some [separate evidence](https://twitter.com/kromark/status/1483836259516784641) in favor of invasion by Radio Free Europe (RFE). The source is obviously biassed and the motives of the interviewed people are unclear. So I assign it a credibility of 50%. If true however, it further increases probability of invasion uniformly by 5%. Finally, Selenskyj made a [statement](https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/ukraine-russland-konflikt-risiko-laut-wolodymyr-selenskyj-nicht-groesser-geworden-a-019b6493-eae9-4180-ab8b-f6dc417d27ea) that the current situation is much ado about nothing. The goal according to him is to damage the ukrainian economy. I am not sure what to make of this, but regard it as weak evidence against invasion, assigning the statement the same 50% credibility and 5% decrease of probability as the previous piece of evidence.

The only two examples in post-soviet Russian history I can find are the invasion of Georgia in 2008 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Georgian_War) and the annexation of Crimea in 2014 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War#2014_annexation). I don't feel either of these are particularly analogous to the current situation, but the former is probably closer in terms of buildup and the latter closer in terms of scope.  The Georgian invasion was preceded by weeks-months of buildup and tensions (which I don't believe has happened yet in the case of Ukraine) which is similar to where we are now. The Crimean annexation was a much quicker affair. However, as the question's possible answers infer, the expected scope of an invasion would be smaller, possibly focusing on the two named Oblasts exclusively, as they are home to Russian separatist movements (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War#/media/File:2014_Russo-ukrainian-conflict_map.svg). So there are two 'outside' views, I believe here. One is that since 2000 (roughly the start of the 'current' Russia; post-soviet, Putin in charge) there have been 2 events that would count as a 'yes' for this style question in 21 years, and this is focused on a 5 month period, e.g. 1 in 25 chance of an invasion (4%). But then the other portion of the outside view is how many times have Russian forces been observed to be building up forces only for no invasion to come. This information is harder to come by but in the last 5 years I can find 5 articles alleging some sort of build up e.g. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/27/military-build-up-along-russias-border-no-cause-for-alarm, https://www.militarytimes.com/news/2017/09/13/whats-putin-up-to-the-russian-military-buildup-on-europes-border-raises-tension/. However none of them seem as persistent and well documented as the current buildup (or Georgia 2008).  Inside view is that this well documented conflict isn't as transient as the other article examples from the last 5 years. There is a lot more information around things this time and a lot more in terms of talking between Russia, the West and Ukraine. According to some Ukranian (or Russian - not sure) language sources on this article - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021%E2%80%932022_Russo-Ukrainian_crisis#Military_escalation - the most likely time for an invasion would be late Jan-Feb. So we are not at the moment of highest risk yet. I think that we're looking at a significant increase on the 4% background risk - given that the only other comparable buildup I can find preceded an invasion (keen to hear from others if they know of more). I think the risk of some kind of 'yes' resolution to this is close to 30%, e.g. 8 times the background rate. https://www.businessinsider.com/satellite-images-show-russian-troop-buildup-sparking-invasion-fears-2021-12?r=US&IR=T suggests that the buildup of troops is not in one specific location near to the border but in fact in several places, north, east and south of Ukraine. So that doesn't help too much with the location(s) of an invasion, but it does seem likely that the Russian separatist areas would be the main focus.

If invasion happens, then there will be casualties from Russia, coupled with heavier sanctions and increasing military aids to Ukraine, and not to mention that countries like Poland may (and will) get closer to the West, I'm not sure what Putin is thinking at the moment.  # Complementary Notes =======================\nUkraine shares borders with both the EU and Russia, but as a former Soviet republic it has deep social and cultural ties with Russia and Russian is widely spoken there.\nUkraine was part of the Soviet Union, which collapsed 30 years ago, and Mr Putin has described the events of December 1991 as the \"disintegration of historical Russia\". When Ukrainians deposed their pro-Russian president in 2014, Russia seized and then annexed the southern Crimean peninsula from Ukraine and Russian-backed separatists captured large swathes of Ukraine's two eastern regions collectively known as the Donbas.\nMoscow is now demanding guarantees that its neighbour will never join Nato, the Western alliance. >>> Is there a real threat of invasion?\nThere is no sense of an imminent threat - or that Russia's President Vladimir Putin has decided on invasion. But he has spoken of \"appropriate retaliatory military-technical measures\" if what he calls the West's aggressive approach continues. CIA Director William Burns believes President Putin \"is putting the Russian military, the Russian security services in a place where they could act in a pretty sweeping way\". [perhaps around end of Jan 2022] >>> What does Russia say?\nMostly that Ukraine is gathering some 125K of its troops  to attack areas controlled by Russian-backed separatists.\nRussia also accuses Nato countries of \"pumping\" Ukraine with weapons. >>> What does Russia want?\nIn short it wants Nato to return to its pre-1997 borders.\nPresident Putin has warned the West not to cross Russia's \"red lines\" on Ukraine.\nThe red lines include:\n1) NATO to stop expansion any further to the east, which includes Ukraine and Georgia.\n2) NATO to abandon military activity in Eastern Europe, which would mean pulling out its combat units from Poland and the Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and not deploying missiles in countries such as Poland and Romania. >>> How far will the West go for Ukraine?\nThe biggest tools in the West's armoury appear to be sanctions and supporting the Ukrainian military. As for economic measures, the biggest tool could be threatening to disconnect Russia's banking system from the international Swift payment system. Another key threat is to prevent the opening of Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in Germany; Germany Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has made clear if there is any further Russian escalation then \"this gas pipeline could not come into service\". https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-56720589 => the outstanding question is whether Russian President Putin is prepared to bear the domestic and international costs of a full-scale invasion or if he\u2019ll stop at pressuring NATO and the West for political concessions.  Mr. Putin\u2019s ultimate goal, many American officials speculate, is to destabilize Ukraine\u2019s government and put in place a leader who will not turn to the West for support. That strategy has worked in Belarus, whose president, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, has grown closer to Mr. Putin and pledged to participate in a growing number of joint military exercises. Mr. Putin has options that do not involve troop movements, including using cyberweapons to cut off part of the electric grid in Ukraine, which is connected to Russia\u2019s grid. Two such attacks, in 2015 and 2016, paralyzed parts of Ukraine, as did the NotPetya attack in 2017 that shut down banks, shops and media organizations. It is considered one of the most expensive cyberattacks in modern history. https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/28/us/politics/nato-russia-ukrain-us.html\nhttps://www.brookings.edu/podcast-episode/will-russia-launch-a-full-military-invasion-of-ukraine/"], [102737, "2021-12-30T23:14:57Z", [0.03, 0.03, 0.03, 0.91], "Initial very subjective forecast."], [80790, "2021-12-30T22:57:57Z", [0.23, 0.0, 0.04, 0.73], ""], [11430, "2021-12-30T21:03:20Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "US Russia make progress addressing Russian fears on the near and abroad."], [484, "2021-12-30T20:28:39Z", [0.05, 0.01, 0.01, 0.93], "Initial forecast.

The regions thing is a new aspect of this I hadn't thought about yet. This article has a graphic showing where the troop buildup is occurring [2]. Useful background info is the Donbas region which is frequently discussed is made up of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions [3]. This link has a map of all of the administrative divisions [4]. It seems to me like based on the troop buildups if Russia were to try to invade Ukraine I'm not sure if they would stick to the Donbas region. It looks like there are troop buildups around Kharkiv as well. My guess is if an invasion happened it would very likely happen in the Donbas region as well as other regions. So I'm putting only a 3% chance the invasion would be confined to outside the Donbas. Also worth noting when trying to find a map of the troop buildup I found previous maps, like this one from 2016 [5]. The scale seems to be smaller, and as far as I know this is the first time the US has announced that Russia is planning an invasion, but troop buildups have happened before and plans don't have to be carried out.
