Leaders of the SPA have already stated that the leaders of the coup are too similar to the former dictator and remain camped outside military headquarters in the capital vowing not to leave until an immediate transition to civilian rule before they leave. If the military can peacefully disperse this crowd of thousand and come to a compromise with civilian leaders the probability of systematic violence in the coming year will drop by ~10%.

Inside view: \n- EWP already count two such episodes: \"We count two distinct ongoing state-led mass killings in Sudan: one in Darfur against non-Arab ethnic groups since 2003, and one in South Kordofan and Blue Nile against ethnic minorities since 2011.\" I assume the Janjaweed killings [2] are included in the Darfur campaign. In any case, the violence seems to have decreased over the past few years. Opposition forces also seem to have mainly attacked military targets. [3] A ceasefire is in place for the South Kordofan conflict and violence seems to have decreased. Again, opposition forces seem to have mainly attacked military targets. [4]\n- there have been protests recently calling for the resignation of the presidents. About 20 protesters seem to have been killed over a few months. [5] [6] Overall judgment:\n- the protests seem to be the most likely candidate for escalation, but not very likely overall. Other violence seems to have decreased significantly. However, the Sudanese government seems to be fairly open to such campaigns in general.\n- my informed gut judgment is 5%.
