In early October, Elon Musk announced that the Crew Dragon could launch in 3 to 4 months [2].  These dates put the earliest possible crewed launch at the end of December.  This timeline is in line with the tentative schedule of an abort test not earlier than November 23 [3], assuming a successful abort test and SpaceX (and NASA) can have a turnaround (analyze the test data and go through the approval processes) in a month.  While SpaceX can work efficiently (rockets and capsule arrived in Florida launching site already [4]), it is unlikely that NASA can do it this fast.   I am throwing in my towel for a crewed launch this year for SpaceX.  My failure in this question is underestimating the time required for SpaceX and NASA, two organizations with different corporate cultures, working together. There is absolutely no chance for Boeing \u2013 its uncrewed test is scheduled for December.

There could be a high probability that in the near future both tech-giants including \"Amazon's Blue Moon\" could team up and launch a space mission but the time ahead is difficult for all the above giants. Seems to me right now that Space X could be a Leader or a team player.

Of course if NOAA might be right about the intense Hurricane season, or the US might have a naval conflict with either the Russian/Iranian alliance or, China over Hong Kong,  or the EU or NATO might collapse. (All these are from the other questions in this thread of course.) Any of those needles jumping into the red could easily  mandate enough minor delays to push it into 2020.  Thusly, I predict Denmark leaves NATO so it can kick the US out of Greenland which causes the Euro and the GBP to both collapse during a no deal Brexit. Surprisingly, the UK housing market will remain flat within 3%, possibly due to an influx of Texans. Simultaneously, a freak double  5th and 6th Hurricane event shuts down 70% of US refining capacity and gulf production, and causes the failure of the Old River Control Structure just to be gratuitous.  The Hurricanes also blow over each of the two nearly launch ready US private crew missions mentioned earlier.  The oil situation pressures the WH to do something stupidly irrelevant as a gesture to secure the perception we have control of Middle East Oil distribution. Oil we don't really need due to a crash-like  consumption slow down.  This will lead to a US naval combat action against Iranian small boat forces which are later determined to have been accompanied by spetznatzs  teams some of whom are killed. The Chinese will use these distractions as cover to execute military police interventions in the HK protests which will result in many dead or at least disappeared. Ensuing US China Naval action, initiated by local fleet command in the absence of timely White House competence,  will very quickly establish that the US is no longer a great power in those waters.   With the EU and GBP economies collapsing the ability and willingness of Europe to support a suddenly needed, delicately arms protected, large scale anti- Ebola vaccine and defense ring will be non existent. Ebola will jump out of DRC.   Since everyone on earth who can do so will feel an emergency obligation to return to the US for their own safety one or two new measles carriers will arrive un-monitored and will visit someplace unexpected like Moline or Des Moines (cause wow does God hate farm country in 2019). This will cause the number of Measles cases to shoot past 5,000. Trudeau will catch  a minor cold but one which makes him look like he has Measles or Ebola or perhaps both for a few days. In his fatigue he will tell Trump that he cannot buy Vancouver Island as a Global Warming retreat and thus incur a negative toned public tweet harassment. Both events, on the eve of his election,  will cause him to loose by 27 votes. (That Horton's place will name him as CEO next day.)

We now know in the general press that the very dated  737 fuselage has in-flight flaws when powered with newer engines (thus the need for software workarounds in the 737 MAX).  The software workarounds since March  - done under duress and to no apparent outcome (inferring that they never did sufficiently testing of the software in the first place) - infer real engineering and organizational shortcomings. If anything were to go wrong with the CST-100 unmanned launch to ISS (much less a manned flight), it would be  \"betting the franchise\" in a misguided attempt to \"double down\" in its attempt to re-establish engineering prominence in flight design and execution. Sales of aircraft could be expected to be cancelled, with untold financial implications.\nSeeing that Boeing pushed off the test flight from April to now August reflects a new sense of caution . So I feel caution will continue, and the decision to test a launch to the ISS  (much less to send a man to the ISS) is not going to happen in 2019. On the other hand - published reports say SpaceX is ready for manned flight to the ISS in Dec 2019. Its reusable Falcon Heavy launchers reflect the innovation of its engineers.  However, Space X has cross-ownership in Tesla, a cash-consuming and very leveraged enterprise. Musk owns majority control of both.  Space X raised a billion in fresh capital in May. There is a chance that some of that money gets siphoned to Tesla - which would slow down SpaceX' needed spending. There is also a chance that any Tesla debt offering gets cross-collateralized by SpaceX. So even if their engineering is checks out and is ready - unexpected cash draws are not unimaginable.\nBut Musk needs a win - and this would be it. \nI don't expect caution is the watchword here. \nAnd if it turns out badly - I don't see this as a franchise bet for Musk the way I see it with Boeing - thus, more runway.\nSo I'll rate the chance of a SpaceX manned flight in 2019 (rightly or wrongly) as more that just an incidental probability."], [75065, "2019-07-16T20:59:25Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2019-07-16T18:53:19Z", [0.89, 0.11, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [76074, "2019-07-16T17:23:57Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [76066, "2019-07-16T16:34:59Z", [0.8, 0.1, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [19260, "2019-07-16T14:17:44Z", [0.81, 0.15, 0.03, 0.01], "Okay, we now publicly know the cause of the anomaly ( https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/15/spacex-and-nasa-detail-cause-of-dragon-test-failure-crewed-flight-this-year-looks-increasingly-difficult/ ), at least well enough that they're talking about it even if the investigation isn't formally closed, and what they're going to do about it (change a valve).

So, we've got some new dates ( https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2019/06/station-planning-new-crew-launch-dates/ ,  HT @dlaiocean ), though apparently not public ones.  How do these compare to the public February ( https://blogs.nasa.gov/commercialcrew/2019/02/06/nasa-partners-update-commercial-crew-launch-dates/ ) and April ( https://blogs.nasa.gov/commercialcrew/2019/04/03/nasas-commercial-crew-program-boeing-test-flight-dates-and-spacex-demo-2-update/ ) dates?  On February 6th, the penciled-in schedule for SpaceX was: SpaceX Demo-1 (uncrewed): March 2, 2019\nSpaceX In-Flight Abort Test: June 2019\nSpaceX Demo-2 (crewed): July 2019 The first succeeded, then there was the static fire test on April 20 that had the anomaly. As of June 17th, the penciled-in schedule for SpaceX is:\nSpaceX Demo-2 (crewed): November 15, 2019 ----- On February 6th, the penciled-in schedule for Boeing was: Boeing Orbital Flight Test (uncrewed): No earlier than April 2019\nBoeing Pad Abort Test: No earlier than May 2019\nBoeing Crew Flight Test (crewed): No earlier than August 2019 On April 3rd, the penciled-in schedule for Boeing was: Boeing Pad Abort Test: Summer 2019\nBoeing Orbital Flight Test (uncrewed): August 2019\nBoeing Crew Flight Test (crewed): Late 2019 As of June 17th, the penciled-in schedule for Boeing is: Boeing Orbital Flight Test (uncrewed):  17 September 2019\nBoeing Crew Flight Test (crewed): 30 November 2019 ----- So.  We knew SpaceX would be delayed by the anomaly, but now we seem to have a solid idea of how delayed -- a previous report put them in \"late 2019\", and this date is consistent with that and still puts them before Boeing.  Further, we've seen Boeing's schedule just keep slipping.  The uncrewed flight test which we were told could be as soon as in two months in February, and were told would be in four months in April, is now in three months in late June.  I fully expect further slippage, don't you? This is in line with my expectations as of the previous release which suggested the anomaly was something that didn't require a serious change to Crew Dragon ( https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2019/05/nasa-briefly-crew-dragon-anomaly-spacex-schedule/ ).  So, my current doubt about SpaceX making it this year is just not being sure if they really will pass the pad test or in-flight abort test without something that worries NASA.  If they test and pass, I'll move the odds sharply up for them.  My current doubt about Boeing is based on their long history of having schedules slip; I expect more slipping."], [70538, "2019-06-21T22:28:43Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [57797, "2019-06-21T21:29:29Z", [0.58, 0.27, 0.07, 0.08], "Updating on newly announced dates.

In view of SpaceX kept launching Dragon capsule successfully after the anomaly, I am still hopeful that the Crewed mission will go before the end of the year.  The assumption is that the anomaly is really an anomaly and once they figure out what it is, it can be fixed easily.  They have 6 months to do this.

While Boeing will have to work double time to repair this image and makes their chance for a launch very unlikely, this will have a ripple affect into all aerial transportation and may cause some doubt into SpaceX's capabilities to have a successful launch. In the aftermath of the 1986 Challenger explosion, NASA refrained from sending astronauts into space for more than two years.

In a bizarre turn of events, Russian news agency TASS published a separate article barely 12 hours later, in which \u2013 once again \u2013 an anonymous space agency source told the outlet that \u201cthe [DM-2] launch of Crew Dragon is likely to be postponed to November\u201d. For the time being, the reality likely stands somewhere in the middle. [...] In reality, it\u2019s extremely unlikely that everything will proceed perfectly, as evidenced by the drawn-out process required for NASA and SpaceX to eventually reach flight-readiness prior to DM-1. If a significant number of challenges arise over the next few months of reviews and work, it\u2019s not out of the question for DM-2\u2019s launch to slip to Q4 2019 or Q1 2020. Splitting the difference, it would be safest to bet that Crew Dragon will lift off with astronauts aboard no earlier than August or September.\" [4] \n- It's hard to say what probability this evidence warrants. 63% seems about right for now for a successful SpaceX launch before end of the year, pending the abort test between April and June.

Just look at how successful either company was in achieving manned spaceflight in 2018. Back in 2014, SpaceX and Boeing both received contracts under NASA's Commercial Crew Development program to build spacecraft that could carry astronauts to the International Space Station. The program is intended to allow NASA to launch astronauts on American spacecraft again, something that hasn't happened since the last flight of the space shuttle in 2011. The spacecraft being developed by SpaceX and Boeing\u2014the Dragon 2 and the CST-100 Starliner, respectively\u2014proved to be more difficult than originally anticipated. Both companies pushed back their plans for 2017 flights to 2018. Elon Musk recently said the Crew Dragon, which is what NASA calls the Dragon 2, is \"way more difficult\" than the cargo version of the spacecraft that is used to take supplies to the ISS. \"As soon as people enter the picture, it's really a giant step up in making sure things go right,\" said Musk at a recent panel on the commercial crew program. \"The oversight from NASA is much tougher.\" Fortunately, however, the work to achieve flights next year seems to be progressing nicely. NASA along with Boeing and SpaceX have indicated that they are on track to hit target launch dates in 2018. A July 20 report released by NASA shows that SpaceX is still targeting an unmanned test flight in February 2018 and a crewed flight in June 2018, and Boeing is aiming to launch an unmanned test flight in June 2018 and a crewed flight in August 2018.

In general the waiting time should decrease, with the Space Shuttle probably being an exception owing to its complexity. I finally settle for 10 months for both SpaceX and Boeing,  and I expect a variance of 3 months (however there is too much guesstimation going on in these figures). Assuming a one month delay on the test unmanned flight for the Dragon II (SpaceX) and Starliner (Boeing), this puts the peak of the probability distribution for the manned flight 2 and 3 months after January 1st 2020. Assuming a normal distribution of 3 months for the error (very naive), this gives a 25% and 16% probability for Space X and Boeing respectively for launching (and a 4% probability that both will launch before January 1st 2020).

NASA is paying SpaceX $2.6 billion and Boeing $4.2 billion to build rocket and capsule launch systems to return astronauts to the International Space Station from U.S. soil for the first time since America\u2019s Space Shuttle program went dark in 2011. Just ahead of the first scheduled un-manned test flight slated for March 2 under NASA\u2019s multibillion-dollar Commercial Crew Program, NASA\u2019s safety advisory panel cited four \u201ckey risk items\u201d in its 2018 annual report earlier this month. For Boeing, they include the capsule\u2019s structural vulnerability when the heat shield is deployed. For SpaceX, the report mentioned the redesign of a SpaceX rocket canister following a 2016 explosion and its \u201cload and go\u201d process of fueling the rocket with the crew already inside the capsule. \u201cParachute performance\u201d remained an issue for both companies. \u201cThere are serious challenges to the current launch schedules for both SpaceX and Boeing,\u201d the report said. For an interactive version of this story, click tmsnrt.rs/2V6pXyN Two people with direct knowledge of the program told Reuters that the space agency\u2019s concerns go beyond the four items listed, and include a risk ledger that as of early February contained 30 to 35 lingering technical concerns each for SpaceX and Boeing. Reuters could not verify what all of the nearly three dozen items are. But the sources familiar with the matter said the companies must address \u201cmost\u201d of those concerns before flying astronauts and, eventually, tourists to space. \nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-space-spacex-boeing-exclusive/exclusive-spacex-boeing-design-risks-threaten-new-delays-for-us-space-program-idUSKCN1QA0GU"], [31450, "2019-02-24T02:39:53Z", [0.1, 0.2, 0.2, 0.5], "SpaceX currently has their first manned launch scheduled for June while Boeing has a launch scheduled for August.

Assuming that even an unmanned failure would push the manned mission past the cut-off, some calculations can be made.
