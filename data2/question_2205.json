Turkey has been hit by the global wave of inflation just as many other countries around the world have been. This wave of inflation has been further exacerbated by Erdogan's insistence  that the Turkish central bank continue to cut interest rates running counter to conventional economic thought on how to control inflation. Going to far as to replace members of monetary policy committee in order to continue reducing interest rates when the existing members refused. This refusal to raise interest rates to control runaway inflation will continue to devalue the Lira driving it above $16. I do believe global inflation will start to be reigned in as COVID ends and central banks around the world begin liftoff from emergency low interest rates.

It seems like perhaps the treasury is using that interest rate gap to build it's own buffer (maybe by buying dollars with the difference), but it is quite a gamble given their downside possibilities. The reportedly low take-up might actually be what they wanted, since the announcement of the scheme seemed to trigger the rally. I'm still of the view that the Lira will devalue this year, but i'm not confident on the degree of devaluation or when. Once it slides a 'small' amount, e.g. to 14-14.5, then at that point the treasury will have to start making top up payments, and if they have to do that it could create a feedback mechanism. But with inflation rates so high and no sign of raising interest rates, it cannot keep up with the dollar, even if there is volatility there too.

The effect of this announcement has allowed the Lira to stage a huge comeback and it is now trading at ~13 USD/TRY again.

The government did not say how exactly they would execute this plan\" A couple of key questions on the plan will be:\n- Is there a limit to how much the treasury will top up deposits to make them equivalent\n- How often/when will the deposit top-ups be made\n- What will the baseline rate be? e.g. will deposits be guaranteed from the time of the announcement's price? 18TRY to USD? I think this announcement was made to improve confidence, but I don't see how it could work in practice. If the Lira slides and the treasury has to mint more Lira to cover the difference for people's deposits, then it will devalue the currency even more.

I think the horizon on this question is too short for the currency to repair itself to below 8. Erdogan doesn't seem likely to change policy and there are no elections till 2023.  If there is a reversion to higher interest rates, then perhaps the Lira could recover to the 8-10 bucket/10-12 bucket.
