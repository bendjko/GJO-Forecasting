"], [373, "2021-01-28T20:48:56Z", [0.4, 0.5, 0.1], ""], [88452, "2021-01-28T16:52:43Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], "/The interim government (the \"Chicu Cabinet\"[1], formed after the 2019 constitutional crisis, has already resigned on 23 December 2020, so there's an urgency in having a parliamentary election [2] well before the date required by the constitution (\"[...]must be held by 2023.\" [2])\nThus, \"Snap elections are expected in early 2021.\"[2]\n/The results of the 2019 Moldovan parliamentary election [3] have only limited limited predictive value, as the PSRM (\"Party of Socialists of the Republic of Moldova\" or in short \"Party of Socialists\" [4]), which received 35 (+10) of the then 101 seats [5] (18 of which via the \"National list\" due to 31.15% of votes; 17 more from Constituencies, which I suppose are direct mandates) was the strongest winner obviously of the collapse of the Party of Communists PCRM [6], which lost all of their previous 21 seats and was previously one of six serious contenders for parliamentary seats. However, I assume that the PSRM in fact is at its core a second infusion of the Communist party with a more democratic make-up. Of the six serious contenders, only four parties managed to overcome the constitutional hurdles to gain seats in Moldova's parliament [5].\n/two more reasons for a limited predictive value are the low sub-50% voter turnout (49.24% in 2019, compared to 55.79% in 2014) [7] and the 2019 Moldovan referendum [8] that in its first question demanded \"Reducing the number of MPs from 101 to 61\" and was approved by 73.66% of voters at a low turnout of 38.95% of voting population.[8]\n/As a result, if applied to the \"next Moldovan parliamentary election\", the 2019 referendum will mean that the number of seats forming a majority will shift from 51 to 31; the largest number of seats will be split between the three major parties/platforms PSRM, ACUM (which is built from DA and PAS, Maia Sandu leads/represents PAS) [9] and the Democratic Party of Moldova [10], while smaller parties will likely more than proportionately lose from the innovations of the 2019 referendum.\n/The Democratic Party will likely be the main unknown in the equation and balance of power after the \"next Moldovan election\", as its outcome will determine whether the ACUM platform will be weak or strong, and whether the next government will require a coalition (in case ACUM does not receive a majority of 31 or more seats). The conservative Shor party plays a minor role and will likely receive 5 seats or less, but could nevertheless be crucial in the next government formation.\n/The PSRM will likely have the function of a blocking minority, as it apparently conserves the post-Soviet heritage in Moldova and will likely oppose any effort of intensifying the opening of the country towards the West in general and towards the EU in particular [11], e.g. through their \"Eastern Partnership\" [12]\n/ the 2019 Moldovan constitutional crisis [13] mainly circled around the former leader of the PSRM, Igor Dodon, and his failed attempt to form a government with ACUM, his role in installing Pavel Filip [15] of the Democratic Party in a role of acting president after Dodon's removal from office, who finally dissolved the parliament in order to provoke a re-election in accordance with the then-opposition party DPM/Democratic Party, and ultimately the question whether \"three months\" are either \"90 days\" or \" the months of March, April, May\", in which point the constitution was unclear [14]. Dodon's (PSRM) role will not only have cost him sympathies among the democratic, young, pro-European population of Moldova, but will also limit the outcome of his party in the \"next parliamentary election\".\n/ in the 2020 Moldovan presidential election the opinion [16] swung hard from the candidate Igor Dodon (the former president, see above) to Maia Sandu after August 2020:\nwhile Dodon used to lead the field in the first round with a preference of 19.4% to 43% between 31 May 2020 and 20 August 2020 (margins varied from 3.8 to 16.0 percentage points), the second round opinion poll saw Maia Sandu lead in a Timpul November poll by a margin of three points (51.5% over 48.5% for Dodon). Sandu finally won, 57.72% over 42.28% for Dodon, at a turnout of 55.08% of registered voters.\n/However, there is also a controversy around the political convictions of M. Sandu:\n\"On 21 February 2019, Sandu and the candidates of the ACUM electoral bloc, both of the national and uninominal constituency, signed a public commitment according to which after the Parliamentary elections of 24 February 2019 they would not make any coalition with the Party of Socialists, Democratic Party and Shor Party, and if this commitment is violated they will resign as MPs. She violated this self-imposed commitment after agreeing to form a coalition government along with the Party of Socialists in early June 2019.\"[17] Conclusion:\nThe second round of the 2020 Moldova presidential election, even if not overly representative for the opinion due to its mediocre turnout of roughly 55%, is probably the best indication there is for a trend in the Moldovan population back towards the pro-European ACUM platform, which promises democracy and intensified links to the EU over ties to Russia which the PSRM stands for. If sustained, the opinion swing observed after August 2020 speaks for an estimated result in the 2021 parliamentary elections, which I expect to take place in Q1 or April 2021, with regards to the reduced number of seats as follows:\nPSRM: 22 seats (12 national list, 10 constituency seats)\nACUM: 30 to 35 seats (max. 19 + 16 seats)\nDPM or Partidul Nostru (PN, \"Our Party\") [18] : 3 seats min.\nShor party: 1 seat min.\n\nIt remains to be seen how far the \"breach of trust\" [17] by building a ACUM-PSRM coalition in 2019 will have caused a sustained damage to the trustworthiness of ACUM. According to the latest opinion polls [18], the DPM (also refererred to as \"PDM\") is unlikely to clear the 5% threshold, and thus could be replaced by the rising PN in the balance of power.
