I gave 2% chance of not mature companies acting like rogues and divided it by 2 due to Covid reducing traffic. The forecast was in end of July. There were 5 months left in the forecast.\nNow there are 2, so the probability should get reduced to 0.5%, moving to 0% given no new developments.  That would have been my update but for: \nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54175359 \"Ms Vasquez was charged on 27 August, and made her first appearance in court on 15 September. The trial is now set for February next year.\" So it seems charges were bought on 27 August, 1m after my original forecast. But the first trial will take place in Feb 2020. So my reading means my forecast failed. I put this in the \"spectacularly wrong\" category. There may be an argument that the absence of a conviction means I'm right. But 1) the phrasing of the question clearly states \"charges\" not \"conviction\"; and b) even if true, so what? My forecast was spectacularly wrong regardless of whether it shows in my Brier. It turns out Uber has been cleared of any criminal responsibility for this incident but has been strongly criticised. \nMy only excuse was it was my first venture into these types of forecasts. But more interesting than pure ego protecting (aka excuses) is where I went wrong. It's been a while since I went wrong by this much, but one learns far more by going wrong than by being right. My forecast about the firm was actually pretty much bang on, so my error was my backup driver forecast.  This was based on the following:\n\"There cannot be criminal charges if there is no mens rea. If a backup driver was not fully concentrating, it's hard to see how any reasonable person could have been concentrating 100% of the time so to prove civil law negligence is going to be difficult. To prove criminal negligence will be impossible. And with no reasonable prospect of a successful prosecution, there will be no convictions. Instead it will just be called an accident in the normal way.\" This analysis was absolutely correct with respect to a normal person driving. But the Uber incident involved a backup driver who \"spent 34% of the time looking at her cell phone while streaming a TV show\".  That is a stunningly negligent act that seems to me to fairly clearly meet a criminal negligence threshold.  My error was to foresee how idiotic some of these paid backup drivers would be! This is an experimental technology. They knew the car would likely go wrong at some point. And yet this lady spend almost 1/3 of her time watching a TV show! I cannot fathom the stupidity of that person. So it seems that I radically overestimated the training and sensibility of the paid backup drivers. A genuine back-up driver watching the road but getting bored and as a result being slow to react would be safe under my above logic. But this level of idiocy permitted by Uber to get behind the wheel I did not foresee. Is this a genuine mistake, or just hindsight? The problem with the hindsight excuse is it doesn't actually surprise me human nature is that way particularly given the levels of boredom one must get as a backup driver. Absence of surprise implies benefit of hindsight cannot entirely explain this error.  But that's not the only mistake I made. With about 6 months of forecasting to go, it would make sense to check if there were any incidents that might yield criminal charges, particularly given it takes time for processes to move so if there wasn't anything at that moment, half the remaining time would likely elapse before any new cases could result in any criminal charges. Looking at the BBC article reveals an article on the same incident (https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-47468391) dated March 2019. This article, over a year before my forecast, clearly said:\n\"Dash-cam footage released by police after the incident appeared to show the vehicle's back-up driver, Rafaela Vasquez, taking her eyes off the road moments before the crash. Further records from the streaming service Hulu suggested that Ms Vasquez had been streaming the TV show, The Voice, on a phone at the time of the crash.\" Had I properly read this, I would have seen a serious risk of criminal charges. But I didn't see it. My conclusion is I botched my research and should have looked at the most recent incidents before making the forecast. There can be no \"hindsight\" argument here. This is something I should have done. Further, this mistake does not impact solely my backup driver forecast. It also hits my firm forecast because I should have looked at this before making that forecast also. After all, the article in March before my forecast stated \"Uber will not face criminal charges, after a decision last year that there was \"no basis for criminal liability\" for the corporation.\" That was an important miss. So even my correct \nfirm forecast was to some extent botched. Final conclusions: \n1) When people are bored, people can be very stupid. \n2) Always do a quick search for recent cases for questions like this.\n3) 90% of my forecast was still correct but the forecast failed due to the botched 10%. So I'm not that far aware from being good at these questions but my backtesting suggests I'm not there yet.

Thanks. EDIT: in German law at least, a distinction is being made between \"grobe Fahrl\u00e4ssigkeit\" (culpable negligence/wanton negligence/gross negligence), which is a criminal charge in most cases, and \"Fahrl\u00e4ssigkeit\" (negligence), which is not a criminal charge in most cases. I bet it depends in the Arizona case on whether the drivers negligence was \"culpable\" or not for the question to resolve \"YES\". To be more concise: \"Vasquez was accused of being distracted on her phone at the time of the accident but she denied using the device while talking to investigators.\"\nMy understanding is that using her phone at the time of the accident (which will be a matter of proof) would make her negligence \"culpable\", but the defendant denies having done so. It will, however, be more interesting to me whether UBER's \"inadequate safety procedures\" and \"the deactivation of Uber's automatic emergency braking system\" will lead to a criminal charge that UBER will ultimately face. Finally, it was UBER's fault that the cyclist or \"object\" was detected 5.6 seconds prior to the impact, but the system failed to categorize the \"object\" correctly or convert the detection into any action to safeguard the cyclist. Initially, I did not intend to answer the question at all, since I'm not intending to put much time into legal detail research; on the other hand, the dw article states: \"In March 2019, prosecutors had declined to file criminal charges against Uber. Vasquez is set to face trial in February 2021.\" So technically, the question will probably resolve \"NO\" due to the fact that any (criminal or not) charge that will happen will lie outside of the time frame the question sets, and it would depend on criminal charges in a different case than the Vasquez case.

However, the number of self-driving cars is much higher than the number of self-driving cars with a paid backup driver. Also based on these articles, it takes 6 months to over 2 years before charges are pressed. This means that if a firm or driver were to be charged, it would likely be from an accident that has already occurred. There are 4 potential charges that could be brought by the end of 2020 (that I'm aware of), 1 against a driver and 3 against Tesla. Although there are more charges against Tesla, I believe it will be harder to fault Tesla since drivers are still responsible while the car is on autopilot.
