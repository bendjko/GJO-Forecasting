Furthermore, I found that international box office tends to account for ~1/2 - 2/3 of total revenue in high grossing movies. After grossing 50 million internationally, I do not expect Tenet to break that mark domestically given US' covid-19 situation which is relatively worse than most countries, small population relative to the rest of the world (1.5 billion total English speakers if you use that as a rough proxy of potentially interested moviegoers), and lack of theaters open, as Zach cited. A counterpoint to this is that the reviews for the movie are quite good (though not stellar by Nolan's standards) so I do not count out the minute chance that Americans make it out to see the movie.  https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl1442940417/"], [95308, "2020-09-03T23:42:12Z", [0.0, 0.99, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0], "Given that Tenet released in US theaters today (9/3), there is little reason to believe that it will gross less than $1 million, considering that the top movies for the last three weeks have all grossed greater than that. As for the upper bound, we can look at Christopher Nolan's previous three original movies. Inception, Inception, Interstellar, and Dunkirk have had $82.6m, $61.8m, and $64.3m as their opening 5-day domestic grosses (data from Box Office Mojo). However, obviously COVID has drastically reduced sales expectations, with only 62% of theaters open and all with social distancing in place. Additionally, the fact that more than half of Americans are extremely unlikely to go to a movie theater a month after they reopen, makes it seem extremely unlikely that Tenet will exceed $80 million (https://fortune.com/2020/09/03/tenet-us-movie-theaters-box-office-coronavirus-pandemic-release/). This lines up with analysts' forecast of about $25-35 million in opening week sales (https://www.boxofficepro.com/long-range-box-office-forecast-christopher-nolans-tenet/). If opening weekend sales are drastically higher than expected, I could adjust this forecast before the deadline.

Further the release date for this movie was today, so we are estimating the amount of money this movie will gross over the next 5 days. It may be also noteworthy that these 5 days will include a public holiday, Labor Day, a popular weekend for movies historically.  As a lower bound, I look at a recently released movie, Bill & Ted Face the Music starring Keanu Reeves. This movie was released on Aug 28th, so there is 6 days worth of cash flow aggregated in the current Box Office Mojo view. As of writing, that movie has grossed 1.3 million. While this movie stars a big name in Keanu Reeves, the budget for the film was roughly 25 million USD, and this movie was only released in roughly 1000 theatres. Further, in regards to box office sales, action genre movies tend to do much better than comedy genre films, which Bill &Ted Face the Music falls under. In contrast, Tenet has all the makings of a box office hit, including a start cast with Robert Pattinson, a renowned director in Christopher Nolan, and a budget of 225 million. For these reasons, I am confident that the lower bound for Tenet\u2019s gross domestic revenue is more than 1 million. To estimate an upper bound, we use an aggressive benchmark \u2013Bad Boys for Life, the third installation in the popular Bad Boys series starring Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. Bad Boys for Life was released in January 2020, well before the covid-19 crisis shuttered cinemas, and performed very well in the box office. This movie, which falls in the action genre, was created with a budget of $90 million and was opened in 3,775 theaters. Similarly to Tenet, this movie\u2019s first five days included a public holiday,  MLK  day. In it\u2019s first five days grossed $79.5 million (https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl1182631425/weekend/?ref_=bo_rl_tab#tabs).  While Tenet has a larger budget than Bad Boys for Life, Tenet is being released in much fewer theatres, and will have limited attendance. For this reason, I believe the 79.5 million benchmark from Bad Boys for Life is a reasonable upper bound.  Finally, I do believe that it is possible that Tenet can perform extremely well in its first few days, perhaps people may be really eager to go back into theaters, although I would not put too much weight behind the probability Tenet will cross $80 million. \n"], [95347, "2020-09-03T21:51:21Z", [0.0, 0.98, 0.02, 0.0, 0.0], "The battle with COVID in the US is constantly evolving, and this has a huge potential to impact a movie's gross earnings. Because of this, I did not feel comfortable using data that was more than a month old. On boxofficemojo.com, I observed that the highest grossing recent movies were The New Mutant, Unhinged, and The Spongebob Movie. Since Tenet is a highly-anticipated movie directed by Christopher Nolan, it makes sense to treat the opening 6 days of these movies as a floor for the prediction for Tenet. The domestic numbers were: The New Mutants: $7,954,226\nUnhinged: $5,957,685\nSpongebob: $1,368,443 All three of these movies opened at over $1,000,000, so that is a highly probable floor for Tenet given that it is a high-profile release. Furthermore, these movies have combined domestic gross revenues of $20,149,123 (not just in the first week). Tenet is certainly a much higher-profile movie than these three (anecdotally, I had heard about Tenet, and not about the others). Therefore while $20,149,123 is the right order of magnitude for an upper bound on Tenet's revenue in its first 6 days, I do think there is a chance that a revenue of $80 million could be surpassed. While people are certainly avoiding theaters due to COVID, they haven't had a high-profile movie like Tenet to attract them to theaters, which could cause a surprise effect in which more people go to the movie than would normally be the case. Furthermore, cases and deaths have been on a slight decline recently. Therefore, while I'm betting strongly on the revenue being between 1 and 80 million, I do want to place some probability on the movie exceeding expectations and surpassing 80 million. But that scenario requires a lot of assumptions and I am only giving it a 2% chance. Intuitively I do think there are greater than 1/100 scenarios in which this happens, but not much higher than that."], [95370, "2020-09-03T21:37:14Z", [0.0, 0.99, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0], "Methodology: We used a baseline model to find an initial forecast and then used individual situation dependent issues to adjust our score. Baseline: We first create a comparable movies space that contains all the movies that critics deemed to be similar to this movie. Critics identified 7 movies that are quite close to this movie, such as Insomnia (2002), Primer (2004), Looper (2012). Looking at all these moves from the past we get an average first week domestic box office value of $15.5M with a median value of $15.01M. Adjustments:\nChristopher Nolan premium: Christopher Nolan is a very well-known filmmaker in the movie industry, thus his movies might garner more interest. Indeed, if we look at comparable movies created by Christopher Nolan (e.g. Inception (2010), Dunkirk (2017), Prestige (2006)), we see that the average value of such movies is $67.8M with a median value of $63.1M. Furthermore, Christopher Nolan movies consistently have a gross box office revenue of over $20M, thus this should give an indication of a lower cap and reinforces a base value. Labor Day weekend adjustment:\nAs suggested by @dzhou3 , we also looked at the biggest box office openings that happened on a Labor Day weekend, and we saw that the highest revenue was $30M and is not statistically significantly different from other weekends. Coronavirus adjustment:\nDue to Covid-19 pandemic, theaters all over the country have closed from one day to another. Local theaters went bankrupt and the whole movie industry shut down. However, with recent reopenings it is expected that Tenet will be released to open in more than 3,000 theaters. Even though this is not the same size as before, it is not much smaller as before. Furthermore, as @kramlal pointed out, recent releases in this Covid environment have not made movies completely go extinct (Keanu Reeves movie made $1.3M since its release on August 28) and people show interest in trying to regain a somewhat normal life. Upper boundaries:\nWe also look at possible upper boundaries for this movie to understand how our distribution should be skewed. We see that there are 3 movies in recent history with an opening week of >$240M and 17 movies >$160M. However, these moves are almost all part of a huge movie franchise (e.g. Marvel Universe, Star Wars), thus these movies might not be good comparables at all and indicate that this specific movie should not be compared to these. It also shows that if the movie is not in a huge franchise, it is not likely that it will be able to get that much interest from the public. Conclusion: Adding together all these factors, we see that the vast majority of our probable distribution lies between $1M and $80M given that there is no precedence for a Christopher Nolan movie to be below $1M and Covid should not make it improbable for a movie to achieve it, but on the upper side, going above $160M is also virtually impossible. Also, given how few movies make it to over $80M and this movie's script is not a typical blockbuster, we put the distribution as shown above."], [95396, "2020-09-03T21:32:13Z", [0.0, 0.78, 0.22, 0.0, 0.0], "updating after convo with @RSparkes.

Tenet's $53mm international open:\nTenet's strong interest in Asia (not China) and European markets, despite preventative measures / closed theaters / limited seating in various countries (ex. South Korea) points to a domestic open of $30 mm (Forbes). 2. COVID lockdown:\nLimited seating capacity due to COVID and projected figure of at least 2,400 domestic theaters (particularly with NYC, LA closed) suggests trimming our base estimate. As a worst case scenario, \"The New Mutants,\u201d in the \u201cX-Men\u201d franchise, opened to $7 million in 2,412 locations this weekend with a global debut of $9.9 million. \"New Mutants\" had a 32% \u201crotten\u201d rating and also less international interest compared to Tenet- yet still finished at 7x the lower bound, which provides a large margin of safety on the lower bound for our estimate. 3. Other Christopher Nolan film openings:\n\"... average debut weekend of Nolan\u2019s last three original films (Inception,\u00a0Interstellar, and\u00a0Dunkirk) is $53.6 million. At $62.8 million, the former of that trio is the highest \u2014 and probably the most relevant comparison to\u00a0Tenet\u00a0given the global scale and action/espionage genre commonalities.\" (Boxofficechicago) Tenet has a rating of 78% fresh on\u00a0Rotten Tomatoes\u00a0and a\u00a0Metacritic\u00a0score of 68, which puts it below the usual Nolan standards; this provides a strong upper bound of <$70mm in the opening weekend. 5. Labor day weekend:\nCurrent record for a Fri-Mon Labor Day opening is $30.5 million in 2007; the extra free day does not warrant a sufficiently high multiplier to assign a probability to bin 3. To summarize: for Tenet to gross more than $80mm in its opening, it would have to exceed Nolan's previous three films during a national lockdown with only a fraction of theaters open, including none in NYC / LA. Risks to the upside are minimal even with strong international showing / positive critical reception / Labor Day weekend. Risks to the downside: \"New Mutants\" performance provides strong margin of safety, even with COVID measures. Only potential risk would be lack of compliance with safety protocols (Vanity Fair), which has a chance of forcing a further delay; given short timeframe of prediction and imminent release I find this incredibly unlikely.

Since Tenet releases domestically on September 3rd (tomorrow) and the prediction settles on September 8th, we're predicting the first 5 days of its box office revenue. Inception earned $82.7M gross in its first 5 days, Dunkirk earned $64.3M, and Interstellar earned $50M. The Dark Knight series is not a fair comparison due to the pre-existing hype surrounding the Batman franchise and subsequent movies in a series generally boosts demand. Given COVID, there are partial closures and decreased demand for theatres, so I am almost certain (> 99.5%) that Tenet will be earning less than Inception, Dunkirk, and Interstellar.  On the flip side, given that Tenet has already released internationally on August 26th and made $53M in international markets over 7 days, there is almost no chance that Tenet will postpone their domestic release date or that it won't be able to make at least $1M in 5 days (given that domestic market gross revenue is usually more than half of international market gross revenue).

I found the global box office revenue in 2019 was $42.5B compared with $11.4B for domestic box office (source: billboard.com), although stats for opening weekend may perform differently.  Another article from washingtonpost suggested that analysts are optimistically forecasting $40M domestic box office for opening weekend with strong international box office as a key indicator. Part of the reason they were optimistic about sales was due to the fact that there isn't much competition with other releases at the moment. Either way, the $80M threshold for the 3rd bin seems quite hard to beat, thus we can confidently forecast between $1M and $80M as of now.

As a side note, Tenet is expected to debut on September 3rd in about 3,000 theaters domestically (source: https://www.indiewire.com/2020/07/tenet-opens-september-3-theaters-future-1234576434/ ). Of the top 5, only Unhinged and The New Mutants (TNM) are apt comparisons to Tenet since they had larger debuts of several thousand theaters. Furthermore, Unhinged is a rather noisy estimate of how much theaters are making on films nowadays since it had an initial limited debut followed by a wider debut of around 2,000 theaters. Thus, we will focus on using TNM as the base case. Using the data from the first 4 days domestic revenue of TNM  (per theater avg.) and the fact that Tenet will debut in approx. 3,000 theaters domestically, I have an estimated 4 day domestic revenue of Tenet of about $9.3m. Since this will be a 5 day estimate, Tenet is arguably a much more popular film that TNM and the fact that the time range will include Labor Day, we can safely assume that Tenet will be more than $1m.  Now let us arrive at an EV and upper bound. To get an upper bound, I consider the highest grossing Labor Day weekend release of all time, Halloween (Source: https://www.boxofficemojo.com/chart/release_top_weekend_gross/?by_occasion=us_laborday_weekend&ref_=bo_rl_rr). Halloween released on a Friday whereas Tenet will release on a Thursday so the weekday difference is not huge. Using Halloween's average theater revenue for the first 5 days and the 3,000 theater debut estimate for Tenet, we get an upper bound of $27.7m. For EV, I take a weighted average of the average daily revenue per theater between TNM (1/3 weight) and Halloween (2/3 weight) for the first 4 days (since that's all the data we have for TNM) and arrive at an EV of 20.7m + say 1m for the 5th day = $21.7m. 1/2 and 2/3 are simply assumptions but seems reasonable to take into account COVID vs. popularity of the film. As such, with our lower and upper bounds squarely between $1m and $80m, I assign a high probability to the $1m-$80m bracket with low probabilities on <$1m and $80m-$160m."], [62808, "2020-09-02T11:18:57Z", [0.25, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [62808, "2020-09-02T11:16:16Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [95351, "2020-09-02T10:43:16Z", [0.0, 0.98, 0.02, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [67609, "2020-09-02T05:59:37Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [40848, "2020-09-02T01:19:10Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [95306, "2020-09-01T22:10:29Z", [0.0, 0.99, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [95306, "2020-09-01T20:15:31Z", [0.0, 0.98, 0.02, 0.0, 0.0], "Dunkirk and "], [691, "2020-09-01T18:59:44Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [27661, "2020-09-01T17:09:53Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [22689, "2020-09-01T16:59:18Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [90814, "2020-09-01T16:47:36Z", [0.0, 0.67, 0.33, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [22689, "2020-09-01T15:15:36Z", [0.0, 0.9, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [29054, "2020-09-01T15:10:33Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [88452, "2020-09-01T14:22:17Z", [0.0, 0.97, 0.03, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [767, "2020-09-01T14:21:57Z", [0.0, 0.8, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [90457, "2020-09-01T13:25:38Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [75291, "2020-09-01T07:12:51Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [67609, "2020-09-01T06:35:32Z", [0.0, 0.99, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [87880, "2020-09-01T02:41:26Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [95269, "2020-08-31T21:29:28Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "Tenet has been average ~$2000 per screen in overseas markets [1].

I'm a little worried that I'm over-revving on this, but my longterm weighted averages are heavily skewed toward my prior views, so a few days at the above allocations won't hurt too much if the above scenario doesn't come to pass.

We don't have data on how willing people are to go to the theater, so I'm totally in the dark about that component. But I am somewhat optimistic about them sticking to the Jul 17 date. The website and twitter say so, Nolan seems to really want a theatrical release, and even if it gets pushed a month that still gives it time to make some money. I assign a significantly higher probability to the higher gross amounts (>160 million) than the crowd because I just don't know how consumer's willingness to go out and see a movie will change over the next few months. It seems unlikely, but if Tenet receives excellent press, is viewed as the only entertainment available, and theaters do a good job rolling out social distancing measures, it might be plausible that it does big numbers.

Taking the average gives $240m best estimate in the absence of COVID. I revised this down slightly to $210m for the US market given it reputedly has a very long runtime. An Ipsos poll [2] suggests that 27% of 4,429 polled Americans would return to cinemas when they re-open, with 32% saying they would wait for a vaccine. I think this number will probably increase slightly by July if cases fall and cinemas show they have good measures for social distancing, and the movie may benefit from being the first to open and having little competition over the summer. So I estimate they might see 40% of \"normal\" turnout, giving a best estimate of $84m. I revised my estimate down a bit given I see more scenarios where gross is significantly lower (e.g. lower-than-expected declines in COVID prevalence) than significantly higher.

From there, I look at a Monte Carlo assuming average of 50-75% of theaters (strikes me as potentially high) are open in the country, operating at 25-50% of capacity. This results in a mean box office gross over the period of $52MM, with a stdev of $11MM, putting 98.8% of all outcomes in the second bucket ($1MM\u2264x\u2264$80MM), and 1.2% in the third ($80MM<X<$160MM).  I have increased weight of the third bucket (to 3%), given that it seems likely that the movie will perform better as a first mover, with so many other film openings being delayed to later in summer or fall.
