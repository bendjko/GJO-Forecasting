The agreed extension of Brexit beyond 29th contradicts with the underlying assumed scenario. Projecting this question on a new Brexit date wouldn\u2019t make sense regarding the aggregation mechanic of this platform). The development of the currency rate over the last month and over the last 6 months don't indicate that there will be a drastic change.

Finally, the option \u201cmore than \u20ac1.10 but less than \u20ac1.20\u201d is the most likely as the currency rate remained within this range for the last 6 months.

The House of Commons rejected Theresa May's withdrawal agreement three times, yet this did not affect the rate. Neither did the ecision to extend the deadline for the Uk leaving the EU for that matter.

Given the political magnitude and far reaching ramifications of these events the chances for the Pound to fall below the 1.10 line in the few remaining hours until April 1 can be considered close to non-existent.

In the short remaining period, even the remote chance of a political earthquake, e.g. sparked by the sudden (and unlikely) resignation of prime minister May is liable to miss  having a major effect on the rate. In my opinion, the only reason why the Pound falling under the 1.10 line or rising above 1.20 cannot be ruled out with absolute certainty stems from the very unlikely although fathomable possibility of a major catastrophic event (In a recent paper Paresh et. al showed for example that terrorist attacks can have both an appreciating and depreciating effect on bilateral exchange rates https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ecin.12447)."], [67428, "2019-03-31T20:15:06Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.99, 0.0, 0.0], "Update: After the rejection of May's withdrawal agreement, for the UK there will be plenty of new possible scenarios developing in the nex weeks, from an hard brexit, to a soft one to a new referendum.

(https://moneytransfercomparison.com/major-economical-events-which-impacted-currency-rates/) Turning to Brexit and the question of an appropriate baseline in order to estimate the closing value of the Pound against the Euro on April, 1, it gets complicated due to the fact that the UK is the first country to leave the EU, the world's biggest and most intertwined economic trade block. However, due to the fact that the Brexit process has been going on for quite a while now with several major incidents, such as the decision of the referendum itself, a lost general election for the British prime minister Theresa May, or the rejection of May's deal in the parliament (twice), it makes sense to take a look at the development of the exchange rates throughout this period: - 2019 Low: 1.106 - High: 1.1507\n- 2018 Low: 1.1023 - High: 1.1591\n- 2017 Low: 1.0771 - High 1.1957\nhttps://www.poundsterlinglive.com/bank-of-england-spot/historical-spot-exchange-rates/gbp/GBP-to-EUR-2017 So only once in August 2017 the pound went under 1.10 against the Euro throughout the whole Brexit process. Due to the most probable postponement of the Brexit (or an acceptance of May's deal and an exit of the UK on time, which would probably rather stabilize the pound rather than weaken it due to deterring a no deal Brexit from happen - the economy biggest fear), the forecast at hand assumes that the trend will most likely continue and there will be no major variation from yesterday's value (On March, 27 the value for the pound against the euro closed at 1 against 1.1688 (https://www.poundsterlinglive.com/best-exchange-rates/british-pound-to-euro-exchange-rate-on-2019-03-27)). Thus, the forecast at hand estimates a likelihood of 96% that the Pound will close as of more than 1.10\u20ac but less than 1.20\u20ac on April 1.

Ex-post edit: A lesson from this question is that, though as people we are often overconfident, in some cases, such as this one, we can be under-confident (as demonstrated by the crowd forecasts on this question). In the current news environment, it's tempting to see Brexit as the one factor that has outsized influence over the UK economy and currency. Availability bias would lead one to then overestimate its influence and to predict that the currency's future is very uncertain due to the uncertainty surrounding Brexit. But this ignores the historical base rates that suggested that the currency was far more stable than assumed by the crowd. This speaks to the usefulness of quantitative methods that estimate uncertainty such as the Monte Carlo method I used. Such methods often tell us that there is far more uncertainty than we typically anticipate.

This is clearly the result of the several twists during the Brexit talks, especially the double rejection of May\u2019s deal by the British Parliament.  However, the recent developments and the following extension of Brexit deadline to at least April 12 (most likely May 22) makes now this forecast much easier than before (as a matter of fact, I predicted this exact Brexit outcome in other 2 related forecasts). Therefore, since currently the exchange rate it is at 1.1688, from here to April 1 it is highly probable that it will remain between 1.10 and 1.20. Usually, I do not like to be overconfident, but in this case I believe it is right to assess to this outcome a 95% chance.  Considering that it did not happen even in the last months when the situation was much more uncertain, the likelihood for the pound to fall below 1 euro is 0%. The same it is true for its rising above 1,3.  Regarding the remining 2 possibilities (between \u20ac1.00 and \u20ac1.10 inclusive and between \u20ac1.20 and \u20ac1.30 inclusive) I cannot totally exclude them since we live in what Knight would have defined as an \u201cuncertain world\u201d and that the Brexit outcome has been strongly uncertain since its very beginning. In this sense, for instance, a sudden resignation of PM T. May (very unlikely but still possible) might actually lead to a considerable variation of the Euro-Pound exchange rate. That said, in case it would be more likely to be between \u20ac1.00 and \u20ac1.10 inclusive than between \u20ac1.20 and \u20ac1.30 since the Pound is currently just slightly above 1.00 (1.16).

It must therefore be known that the British political evolution will be inseparably linked to the evolution of the pound, and that Brexit will therefore be the catalyst of the value of the pound.\nAccording to the different scenarios of Brexit, we can try to understand the possible value of pound against the euro :\n- In the case of the extension of the Brexit deadline, the value of the pound will not have to change so much and therefore be between 1.10 and 1.20. Or even in the case of a finely played Brexit soft, go up a little more than the average of the last two years. Moreover, this Brexit scenario seems the most likely (in a forecast I place it at 65%).\n- In the case of Parliament's adoption of the Brexit agreement, the pound is expected to fall but still stabilize thanks to agreements with the European Union. The likelihood of this scenario is 20% in my opinion. The fall will not be too brutal.\nIn case of No-Deal, depreciation of the currency will be extremely strong. Indeed, imports will be much cheaper against UK exports, which will be taxed by the EU. In this case, the scenario for the pound is not impossible to be below the 1.0 value bar. Nevertheless, the likelihood of this scenario at present is 10%.\nIt is therefore more likely, following the current Brexit events, that the pound will be between 1.10 and 1.20 for 1.0 euro on 1 April 2019.

For the pound to fall below 1 euro or rising above 1,3 is absolutely unlikely. Even though the possible enter into effect of the Brexit could have a major impact on pund's value, these two extreme cases are, in my opinion, almost impossible.\nThe other considerations necessarlly have to take into account the major economic and politic dynamics that can happen in the next month in Europe and UK - namely, most of all the path the Brexit will take. While in this forecast I won't analyze in lenght all the possibilities, here I reduce the analysis to economic matters - not exactely my field, but it's worth a shot. The resilience of the pound, even in the most turbolent phases of UK politics since 2017, is definetly something to take into account. UK is and will remain a big economy, which in my opinion will be affected by the turbolence deriving from Brexit but not necessarily in a catastrophic way. Moreover, a macroeconomic dynamic has to be taken into account: while the effects of the Brexit could lower the pound's value, the expenses deriving from the deal - if the deal remains the one stipulated, which is debatable, the UK will have to pay around 36 billions to the EU - will produce a reduction in the availabilty of pounds on the currency market, which in macroeconomics means an increase in the pound's value. If the UK's export, on the other side, will suffer for the exit from the EU, this would lead to a decrease in the pound's value to compensate the exports' reduction. All in all, wether the Brexit will be delayed (which would lead to a more or less stability in the exchange rate) or the Brexit will happen the 29th of this month the pound will be stable.

I believe that, having grown accustomed to the idea of a brexit, the days after 29th of March will not see as much volatility as the three days after the brexit vote. Especially not considering that the 29th of March will likely mean that the brexit deal negotiations will be extended.  The one way I do see a similar shock to the exchange rate is if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the so called hard brexit. The house has voted that there will be no hard Brexit by the British, but a hard brexit can still be enforced by European nations, which therefore does not rule out the possibility of such an exit. In that case it would be possible to see the exchange rate plummet below the 1.10 boundary.  There is a small chance, either due to the extension of the article 50, or because of a deal being striken, that there is an upwards shock that would lift the exhange rates above 1.20. However I do not believe an extension of the article 50 will give rise to a rise significant enough to allow it to go above the 1.20 boundary, because an extension does not clear up any uncertainty regarding the brexit in the long term.

In questions like this I often use similar approach as @Emil or @nigster  but I am going to refrain from it this time. I believe Brexit is  really one off event that will determine final result so using past data is not adding much value here..\nSo different Brexit scenarios will lead to different buckets. What I see is that general opinion is that Article 50 will be extended that would lead to GBP appreciating or staying in current bucket but I am still not that optimistic about it. UK MPs are going to instruct the government to extend the article 50 negotiating period until the end of the year if the prime minister fails to win parliamentary approval for a withdrawal Bill by February 26th, but Extension needs to be approved by EU unanimously as well. EU insisted many times that to extend Article 50 it needs to have good reason like new referendum, probably another elections would also work but I do not believe those are options British parliament would accept? What are chances that British Parliament will agree to ANY reason why it should be extended? \nI can see EU accepting extension even if the reason is just better preparation for no deal Brexit but I do not see British parliament agreeing for it.\nAnd if the deal is extended, option that as written above is hard to achieve in my opinion,  I think that after short term euphoria resulting in GBP appreciating everyone will realize that problems are not fixed. Can was just kicked dawn the road.  As a result GBPEUR will probably stay in current 1.1-1.2 bucket which is quite wide. No deal Brexit, option that is still probable in my opinion will lead to depreciation of GBP but will it fall below 1.1? There are chances but it may as well stay in 1.1-1.15 area as EUR will get harm for no deal Brexit as well. Therefore movement on GBP/USD would be more significant than  EUR/GBP. \nWhat are other factors that may impact result.

A hard exit will lead to further devaluation and vice versa. The outcome will depend on what is expected and priced in the markets currently, which I will address in a future post.  For now, I see the recent unravelling of May's deal as a low point. Any improvements that lower the chances of a hard Brexit will likely strengthen the GBP.
