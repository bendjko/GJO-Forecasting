Democrats went into the 2016 election with a 95K advantage in early voting, but Trump ended up winning the state. As of today, the Democrat lead stands at 131K in early vote count. Republicans reduce the lead by 40K each day. Hillary's support among Hispanics in Florida was 27 pts higher than Trump. Biden only has a 5 pt advantage.  Trump wins the state by 2-3%. \nhttps://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/29/miami-voter-turnout-democrats-433643"], [49689, "2020-10-30T18:22:14Z", [0.63, 0.37, 0.0], "EBO: 45% (-10)\nFTE: 66% (-6)\nCrowd: 62% (-3)"], [95565, "2020-10-30T16:36:53Z", [0.69, 0.31, 0.0], ""], [88098, "2020-10-30T16:06:33Z", [0.6, 0.4, 0.0], ""], [40584, "2020-10-30T15:50:57Z", [0.64, 0.36, 0.0], ""], [68240, "2020-10-30T14:42:38Z", [0.65, 0.35, 0.0], "Adjusting to match 538."], [86816, "2020-10-30T14:04:52Z", [0.7, 0.3, 0.0], ""], [94837, "2020-10-30T11:18:49Z", [0.69, 0.31, 0.0], ""], [31251, "2020-10-30T07:11:12Z", [0.59, 0.41, 0.0], ""], [90167, "2020-10-30T03:13:31Z", [0.69, 0.31, 0.0], ""], [57778, "2020-10-30T02:14:27Z", [0.65, 0.35, 0.0], ""], [88002, "2020-10-30T01:35:00Z", [0.81, 0.19, 0.0], ""], [89038, "2020-10-29T23:36:37Z", [0.58, 0.42, 0.0], ""], [94872, "2020-10-29T22:57:06Z", [0.68, 0.32, 0.0], ""], [35033, "2020-10-29T22:42:58Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [95565, "2020-10-29T22:05:53Z", [0.68, 0.32, 0.0], ""], [60948, "2020-10-29T21:42:39Z", [0.7, 0.3, 0.0], ""], [67403, "2020-10-29T21:18:13Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [56136, "2020-10-29T20:29:11Z", [0.55, 0.45, 0.0], ""], [60948, "2020-10-29T19:31:59Z", [0.75, 0.25, 0.0], "Forecast autogenerated; see profile for details."], [95117, "2020-10-29T19:22:29Z", [0.65, 0.35, 0.0], ""], [25705, "2020-10-29T15:47:21Z", [0.9, 0.1, 0.0], "It may be my wishful thinking..."], [25705, "2020-10-29T15:42:38Z", [0.72, 0.28, 0.0], ""], [691, "2020-10-29T15:08:54Z", [0.66, 0.34, 0.0], ""], [68240, "2020-10-29T14:46:06Z", [0.72, 0.28, 0.0], "Dem (+3), I'm adjusting to approach 538."], [40584, "2020-10-29T14:17:32Z", [0.55, 0.45, 0.0], ""], [80475, "2020-10-29T14:07:39Z", [0.8, 0.2, 0.0], "Marist College poll, A+ rated pollster by 538, just came out with Biden +4 in likely voters. \nhttp://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NBC-News_Marist-Poll_FL-Likely-Voters_NOS-and-Tables_202010281159.pdf\nAmong those who have already voted, page 9 of that PDF, Biden is 59% compared with 40% for Trump. Using the vote count on October 27th (a conservative estimate since some mailed-in ballots were en route), as of that date there was a cumulative total of about 3.8 million ballots cast for Biden and 2.6 million for Trump. In the 2 days since then, 980,000 additional votes have been cast in FL. Using the yet-to-vote percentages from the poll, about 363k of those votes were for Biden and 568k were for Trump. My current estimated vote tally for ballots already submitted is:\nBiden 4.1 million\nTrump 3.1 million. For each million extra ballots cast after that October 27th date of the poll, Trump should get 580,000 votes and Biden 370,000. (At some point, I wonder if Republicans will realize that their undemocratic quest to stop counting late-arriving ballots is actually hurting them, not Democrats, this year, since Dems got the message to get their votes in early.) How much runway is there for Trump to catch up? There are 1.8 million absentee ballots yet to be returned. There are about 5 million registered voters left who have not yet voted nor have requested an absentee ballot.  Total: 6.8 million if everyone voted who is registered to do so. For Trump to win at this point, it would require maybe 4.8 million more votes to be cast from now until election day, for an overall turnout of 87% of FL's registered voters.

To avoid repeating the Hillary vote profile, Biden needs to get a better turn out with the young and the black voters.

We need leadership that actually listens, and understands that science is a better predictor than gut feelings, and changing the way we police is a priority for us all. Police are not social workers, yet they are asked to respond to those issues when in no way are they trained for it. Our judicial system and Republicans are losing the arguments that matter most to the electorate, and it\u2019s the trump administration putting fuel to a fire that needs to be put out.
