So, the real question is whether Trump believes there is political gain from doing so and congress and/or the republican base is willing to go for it. I believe that the costs far outweigh the benefits in this case.  a) A war in that region would definitely raise oil prices - something that would quickly be pinned on Trump\nb) I don't know how much political gain there is in this conflict - helping out Saudi Arabia doesn't seem like something that garners huge support. Recent poling on intervening in Iran suggested that only 25% of Republicans supported military conflict. [1]\nc) This is a little too far out from an election to really boost election probabilities, while a failure could be pretty devastating.  I know Trump came out with the 'locked and loaded' but at this point I can't read into his tweets at all. I think talk will be valuable and I don't think there is any pressing need to intervene soon. Waiting 3 months to get better evidence would definitely be advantageous. So I think that if the U.S is dictating, they will be patient and try to garner support before entering. So I think at this point a very low probability - less than 5 percent - and I will update as more information about the attacks comes out.  There is the other probability that Saudi Arabia enters and the U.S. comes to their support. That to me seems very unlikely as I can't imagine Saudi Arabia going into this conflict without garnering U.S. approval previously.  From a historical perspective, this list of U.S. miltary interventions [2] indicates that about one to four events of U.S. military intervention happen per year over the past decade, but the vast majority are not against national military forces of another country. So this would definitely be a highly unusual occurrence.

Supporting \"allies\" is less important than it used to be. If the U.S. were to conduct a military strike, it would be very careful to be proportionate to the original strike, which means targeting infrastructure and causing no fatalities, particularly any military fatalities.
