Maybe he'll lose legal challenges in one or two, but 8 or fewer appears almost impossible given he'd need to lose more legal challenges than new states he submit for. His maximum is therefore 28, but some of those are extremely hard (such as California, which needed 200k signatures by today). It appears he isn't really trying to get on everywhere, so he probably won't even try all 19 remaining states. If he gets on at more than 7 additional states then he clears the second option.
