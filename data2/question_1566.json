Trump has previously championed lower interest rates as well as called for negative interest rates. While firing the chair or tweeting about the chair wont change the bands. POTUS does have the ability to appoint 2 more governors and will only have to go through the senate (granted this would have to happen it hyper speed). POTUS also has the ability through policy to add to the debt which in turn could cause the FOMC to have to make a move.  Wild card - 10% split evenly - Given the state of the economy and the uncertainty surrounding the Covid pandemic we have seen the Fed say things like they have crossed red lines and tried new types of tools but most of all the Fed has mentioned they wont know what kind of effects these programs will have. Could the Fed go back to a single rate rather than a range? Could they abolish trying to manipulate short term interest rates and try to control long yield? I'm not sure, which is why I put this extra 10% of unknown I would usually keep out of my forecasts.  Other forecasters- 8.5% same 1.5% higher  - Using CME forecast + This Good Judgement project  FOMC - 35% same, 11.5% higher, 8.5% lower - Given the history of the meetings excluding emergency meetings. I see 60% of the time the rates stay the same and when there is a change in rate they tend to increase more than decrease.  While my bias is that the rate holds steady. Given the current uncertainty of a number of issues in the US (Covid, election year) i believe that if an unexpected event or situation came up I don't think paralysis would be an option.

Has the fed ever raised or lowered the upper band without raising or lowering the lower band at the same time? ( I believe the answer is no to this one. But want to dig deeper)\n2. could the fed go back to a single number rather than a range system?\n3.The range system was created during the 2008 financial crisis, does it still serve its purpose?\n4. The CME and other forecasters including the ones on here seem to have a consensus between 90%-100% there will be no change. How often have these forecasts/forecasters been surprised?
