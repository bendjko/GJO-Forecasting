There is no way around the Greens unless the CDU/CSU distort themselves beyond recognition to be the minor partner in a coaltion with the SPD, so that gets a generous 4%. I think the Greens are going to be the Center of any negotiations and can get quite a lot of their demands, when they play Conserservatives and SPD against each other, especially when Greens and FDP quickly find a common ground. So the big unknowns at moment are: 1. What is the FDP doing? Because FDP and Union will get along pretty quickly and I asume also Union and Greens would (surprisingly quickly to most people)  agree on most issues. That was already appearent four years ago, when the FDP all of a sudden withdraw from coaliton talks. I think in the end it will come down either Jamaica (Union-Green-FDP) or Red-Green-Red. Traffic light seems to me not likely the moment (although quite a lot of people would like to see that), especially when Greens and FDP not coming to a common ground at one point. If that results in a government, I'm not expecting that it will last for four years. I expect long and complicated talks between the parties but also within the parties, especially within the CDU  (sorting out the post merkel future within the party), the FDP (party has been a Christian Lindner one man show the last four years), the Left (sticking to doctine and fundamentally to opposition or taking a more practical approach and seeking government responsibility)."], [34959, "2021-09-24T00:45:26Z", [0.07, 0.48, 0.3, 0.0, 0.15], ""], [1333, "2021-09-23T20:31:29Z", [0.01, 0.48, 0.42, 0.0, 0.09], ""], [31455, "2021-09-23T20:23:23Z", [0.18, 0.3, 0.42, 0.0, 0.1], ""], [87310, "2021-09-23T20:16:32Z", [0.16, 0.5, 0.2, 0.0, 0.14], ""], [72517, "2021-09-23T18:24:24Z", [0.1, 0.45, 0.22, 0.0, 0.23], ""], [97312, "2021-09-23T17:38:56Z", [0.25, 0.19, 0.1, 0.01, 0.45], ""], [691, "2021-09-23T17:28:55Z", [0.04, 0.46, 0.38, 0.0, 0.12], ""], [84880, "2021-09-23T16:10:50Z", [0.19, 0.01, 0.55, 0.01, 0.24], "Worth a peep: http://politicalgambler.com/german-election-betting-guide-bets-advised-on-vote-share-and-next-government/"], [20692, "2021-09-23T14:01:06Z", [0.21, 0.51, 0.21, 0.0, 0.07], ""], [13306, "2021-09-23T12:09:25Z", [0.05, 0.6, 0.25, 0.0, 0.1], ""], [96828, "2021-09-23T03:53:28Z", [0.09, 0.35, 0.28, 0.12, 0.16], ""], [94872, "2021-09-23T01:52:58Z", [0.09, 0.42, 0.31, 0.0, 0.18], ""], [2965, "2021-09-23T00:37:46Z", [0.0, 0.6, 0.38, 0.0, 0.02], ""], [87310, "2021-09-22T22:45:43Z", [0.14, 0.5, 0.22, 0.0, 0.14], ""], [94837, "2021-09-22T19:15:46Z", [0.07, 0.44, 0.38, 0.0, 0.11], ""], [102718, "2021-09-22T18:14:35Z", [0.1, 0.09, 0.16, 0.0, 0.65], ""], [1333, "2021-09-22T18:08:28Z", [0.0, 0.48, 0.42, 0.0, 0.1], ""], [691, "2021-09-22T16:37:14Z", [0.04, 0.46, 0.38, 0.0, 0.12], ""], [17007, "2021-09-22T13:44:55Z", [0.08, 0.55, 0.35, 0.0, 0.02], ""], [102645, "2021-09-22T13:39:24Z", [0.11, 0.34, 0.54, 0.0, 0.01], ""], [102647, "2021-09-22T13:36:25Z", [0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [102643, "2021-09-22T13:36:17Z", [0.07, 0.38, 0.42, 0.0, 0.13], ""], [102646, "2021-09-22T13:35:08Z", [0.0, 0.4, 0.6, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [102644, "2021-09-22T13:34:35Z", [0.41, 0.16, 0.24, 0.12, 0.07], ""], [102648, "2021-09-22T13:34:22Z", [0.09, 0.4, 0.36, 0.0, 0.15], ""], [102642, "2021-09-22T13:33:21Z", [0.07, 0.51, 0.16, 0.05, 0.21], ""], [22689, "2021-09-21T18:29:12Z", [0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2021-09-21T18:06:27Z", [0.0, 0.47, 0.34, 0.0, 0.19], ""], [13306, "2021-09-21T11:28:44Z", [0.08, 0.5, 0.33, 0.0, 0.09], ""], [86353, "2021-09-21T10:19:04Z", [0.08, 0.6, 0.18, 0.0, 0.14], ""], [34815, "2021-09-21T01:47:56Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [32258, "2021-09-21T00:25:53Z", [0.0, 0.3, 0.65, 0.0, 0.05], ""], [94872, "2021-09-21T00:14:59Z", [0.09, 0.38, 0.35, 0.0, 0.18], ""], [96828, "2021-09-20T20:49:22Z", [0.11, 0.29, 0.26, 0.05, 0.29], ""], [96828, "2021-09-20T20:46:28Z", [0.08, 0.3, 0.27, 0.05, 0.3], ""], [16113, "2021-09-20T20:34:00Z", [0.12, 0.62, 0.08, 0.05, 0.13], ""], [97312, "2021-09-20T19:40:32Z", [0.25, 0.19, 0.1, 0.01, 0.45], ""], [97140, "2021-09-20T19:21:11Z", [0.15, 0.5, 0.14, 0.0, 0.21], "Coalitions considered most probable:\n> SPD, FDP and Greens: High probability of winning > 50% (0.7), but low probability to form coalition (0.15)\n> SPD, Left and Greens: Low probability of winning > 50% (0.4), but high probability to form a coalition (0.7)"], [1333, "2021-09-20T19:18:33Z", [0.2, 0.28, 0.33, 0.0, 0.19], ""], [691, "2021-09-20T14:56:37Z", [0.08, 0.4, 0.38, 0.0, 0.14], ""], [58028, "2021-09-20T09:16:38Z", [0.15, 0.3, 0.25, 0.0, 0.3], ""], [100608, "2021-09-20T08:02:58Z", [0.13, 0.55, 0.31, 0.0, 0.01], "SPD felt to have won the TV debate.

Recently, a coalition of SPD and CDU has also become possible again. The parties have now already announced exploratory talks after the elections for various combinations. I think these talks will take longer than before, I estimate up to four weeks. When it comes to coalition talks, for example, between the SPD, the Greens and the FDP, it could take a very long time because the Greens and the FDP sometimes have completely contradictory content. These talks could fail after 4-8 weeks. Then there are new specialization talks and coalition negotiations again - and all the sudden there is Christmas. Current example: Netherlands.

At the moment it looks like there will be several viable options of forming a government unlike after the last election, when nobody was really happy with the result. For me it comes down to the question: How likely is it, that the Greens will be part of the next government. I think the probability of the Greens joining the government is at least 80%. Why? Because they are hungry for power after 16 years of opposition. The CDU sees itself as the \"naturaly rightful\" ruling party.

It feels to me very unlikely that the two biggest parties are not Green and CDU and that they could not have a strong majority. Probably above 85% even this far out. So the question becomes - would the CDU/CSU not enter a coalition with the greens or vice versa. Could the CDU/CSU mathematically have a coalition that works without the Greens. Possibly, they have a lot of potential partners and it feels probably around a third, maybe a bit less, probability (they currently total just under 45% of polling averages) they the left, AfD and greens get to over 50%. But would they? Feels very unlikely. The Greens would have done hugely well, Germany is used to coalitions and it feels relatively easily to come up with a common vision with a lot of environmental policy. Optics of excluding them feels awful both for CDU/CSU and for the potentially multiple coalition partners they would need. Could the Greens have a coalition that works mathematically without the CDU/CSU. Here - probably similar or slightly higher probability. Would think the only partner they would fully rule out would be AfD, so maths is slightly easier. But it is not obvious why they would do it in most cases. Green / SPD would seem the most obvious from their perspective, but a) mathematically that probably will not work (combined polling currently around 40% so maybe c 15% they would get to the right number?) and b) why not go with a broader coalition and have an overwhelming majority.  They can always try something else later. FDP or multi party seems less stable. So why do them if you have a willing coalition partner in CDU/CSU? So let\u2019s say:\nJust Greens - 15% works with SDP but only 40% chance they do it. Plus a percent or two for something more out of left field. 8%\nJust CDU/CSU - maybe 67% it is broadly possible but only 5% they take it up/ can deliver. 3%\nPutting 3% for no government (feels like the only way that happens is a massive CDU/CSU and green falling out.

Two blocks may form the new Government: CDU(max) + Green or Green(max) + CDU xor Green(max) + SPD + Linke. (max) party lead the new government and determine the chancellor. I assume that CDU + Green + FDP has also a certain probability, even Green Party and FDP cooperate only on very few topics in the past. Green + SPD + Linke + FDP Government will happen only and only if FDP is keen to govern independently of its party program. CDU + FDP has lower probability due to momentarily opinion poll shares of both parties.  The shares of votes for Parties might be therefore like this on next election for next Bundestag from my point of view: No Leadership by CDU, no great coalition by CDU and SPD, no majority by red/red/green, SPD/LINKE/Green, no majority by CDU and Green and no chancellor Laschet possible. Yes majority by Green, then Leadership to build Government and establish the proposal of chancellor possible, yes CDU > SPD and/or Green > CDU, but Green + CDU < 49,9 % on Bundestag, yes FDP > Linke and/or Green+FDP+SPD < 49,9%, therefore CDU + FDP << 49,9% and CDU+FDP > Green. Conclusion: Green lead Government and establish the proposal for Chancellor but will be controlled by majority of government that are CDU + FDP. Therefore I expect a coalition of Green+CDU+FDP by 52% or so.  Baseline facts from my perspective: The voters of CDU are 60 or older. About 25 millions adults or so are retired and are extremely conservative. 13 millions adults or so have an age between 55 and 65. That means half of population are retired or are going on retirement soon. 10 million children going to schools or universities or doing an apprenticeship. About 10 Millionen or so are migrants and do not have citizenship of Germany and can not elect. The rest do not going to election. Gerontology part of society will determine the election. The whole society has to pay for retired people about 330 Billion Euro per year. The normal budget of Germany is about 340 billions Euro. The transfer duties of young population to retired people are extreme and will be more extremer in this decade due to demographics. Therefore the Germany society is a transfer society.: retired people, young people, etc.. The Germans hate Change, hate Technology, hate Capitalism, hate Industry, hate China, hate USA, hate EU, hate Foreigners, hate military people, ... The CDU + SPD governments after about 15 years have a legacy: Insufficient administration, insufficient infrastructure, insufficient digitalization, ... Revolution is being needed. The outcome of election might be that a new government are elected that ensures going ahead with same, or the outcome is shocking > Communism > Green + Linke + SPD.

The Greens because they are eager to get into power, and in their mindset, they have been way to long in the opposition. The Union on the other hand probably going to have some heated dicussions about joining in or leading the opposition, similar to the SPD four years ago. But to be a junior in government is a rather foreign thought to them, which they first have to get used to. \nWhen numbers are so, that a government can't formed without the Union, they are grudgingly joining, cause avoiding uncertainty, but not without some turmoil within the party. I increased the probability that Union will be in the government but not the Greens and decreasing government with the Greens but now Union.

To reduce the number of possibilities I assume that all parties\nhave these preferences regarding the formation of a government coalition: Reign alone > coalition of two > coalition of three >\n  > no government is formed > form a minority government So everybody would prefer to reign alone the most and being in a minority\ngovernment the least. Exotic Futures\n================================================== Since 1961 no party could win an absolute majority in Germany and the recent\npolls say that it will stay so. Consequently I assign zero probability to\nthese possibilities. There were 4 minority governments in Germany at the federal level, but all were\nthe result of a coalition crisis and only an interim solution\n(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_government#Germany). Furthermore I would\nregard the formation of a minority government in times of COVID in Germany very\nunlikely. So zero probability for these outcomes too. Possible coalitions that currently have voter support much lower than 50% or\nwould simply explode if somebody would try to establish them are also considered\nimpossible (zero prob.). Two Party Coalitions\n================================================== In order to be formed (1) both parties together must get more than 50% of the votes\nand (2) both must be willing to form a coalition. So the probability for a successful\ngovernment formation is:   P( \"WIN>50%\" ) * P( \"UNITE\" ) NOTE: When I try to estimate P( \"UNITE\" ), I assume that the concerned parties have\nthe majority needed. But this doesn't mean that this is the only majority availible.\nIf, for example, the CDU has a majority together with the SPD, it is pretty likely\nthat the CDU could also choose another coalition partner. Furthermore time is\nplaying a role here. Some coalition options never existed before on the federal level\nand would bring together very diverse political views. So in these cases it could take\nforever to form a coalition and the timeframe for the forecast would simply end. The two party options worth considering are: CDU + FDP \"Black and Yellow Coalition\"\n================================================== Happened often in the past, but low probability now:   P( \"WIN>50%\" ) = 0.2 CDU and FDP are politically close and would form a coalition:   P( \"UNITE\" ) = 0.95 CDU + SPD \"Grand Coalition\"\n================================================== Happened often in the (recent) times, but both the CDU and the SPD are in\na downward trend:   P( \"WIN>50%\" ) = 0.3 This ist the coalition that reigns Germany now, but both sides seem not to be eager to\ncontinue this arrangement due to political differences:    P( \"UNITE\" ) = 0.25 SPD + FDP\n================================================== Existed seldom in the past and currently very unlikely to win a majority:   P( \"WIN>50%\" ) = 0 SPD + Green Party\n================================================== Green Party in upward trend but weaker than the CDU, SPD in downward trend:   P( \"WIN>50%\" ) = 0.2 Were in power from 1998 to 2005, so could be revived again:    P( \"UNITE\" ) = 0.8 CDU + AFD\n================================================== AFD is weaker than the SPD, so:   P( \"WIN>50%\" ) = 0.2 The AFD is a pariah in the german political landscape and no other party is\nwilling to cooperate with the AFD. But the CDU is politically close to the\nAFD (especially considering the voter base) and cooperation might eventually\noccur. Nevertheless the CDU would probably prefer FDP, SPD or the Green Party,\nif possible.    P( \"UNITE\" ) = 0.1 CDU + Green Party\n================================================== The only two party coalition that would have a (light) majority \naccording to recent polls:   P( \"WIN>50%\" ) = 0.45 The Green Party and the CDU on the federal level never formed a\ncoalition before, and negotiating one could be difficult due to\nstrong political differences of the voter bases.    P( \"UNITE\" ) = 0.15 Three Party Coalitions\n================================================== Bringing three of the german parties together can be considered more difficult.\nSo P( \"UNITE\" ) should be much lower in general in the three party case. CDU + FDP + AFD\n================================================== Approximately same number of supporters like CDU + Green Party:   P( \"WIN>50%\" ) = 0.4 As discussed above coalitions with AFD are dangerous and in this case\ntwo parties have to succumb to the temptation. On the other hand the\npolitical differences between these three parties are surmountable.    P( \"UNITE\" ) = 0.02 CDU + SPD + Green Party\n================================================== These are the three largest parties in Germany, so it is really possible\nthat they can win more than 50% of the votes.   P( \"WIN>50%\" ) = 0.65 It is less likely that CDU + SPD + Green Party have a majority but\nCDU + Green Party not. Furthermore both SPD and the Green Party must\ntolerate the politically rather distant CDU and vice versa. Such a\ncoalition has never existed on the federal level.    P( \"UNITE\" ) = 0.05 CDU + FDP + Green Party \"Jamaica Coalition\"\n==================================================   P( \"WIN>50%\" ) = 0.55 Such a coalition was almost formed in 2017 on the federal level.\nFDP opted out and suffered losses.

CDU/CSU and Greens plus any or none of FDP or SPD (or indeed AfD or Left)\n2. CDU/CSU and SPD  (and indeed potentially others, excluding Greens)\n3. CDU/CSP and FDP (and indeed potentially others, excluding Greens)\n4. SPD, Greens plus possibly  Left (or indeed others)\n5. No Government forming\n6. Something else 2 - this feels difficult to me. Currently the CDU/CSU and SPD are polling at around 40%. It would need a relatively big shift to get that above 50% (and the seats do seem to end up close to proportional on seats), especially given that CDU/CSU seem to be on a downward trend. I also cannot see that grouping really working with any of the other 3 parties. Finally, even if these two got above 50% not sure, why they would exclude the Greens, especially if they are polling above the SPD (which again, momentum and recent polling would suggest they will, just seems tough politically unless the Greens had a terrible night, or SDP or CDU/CSU had a great one. So maybe something like 15% chance that the coalition works mathematically, and let's err on the side of generous and call it 75/25 that if it does work they would go for it. 3 - this seems very remote as it does not seem there are any acceptable coalition partners for these two - maybe 5% chance of these two having the required seats. If it does work they would probably go for it. 4 - Currently polling at a bit below 40%, but Greens seem to have momentum. Plus the Left are probably an extreme, but not impossible coalition partner. Let's call it c. 15% chance that Greens and SDP could form a coalition Government, but a high chance that they would do so if they could, and a non-zero chance they team up with the left, to put this possibility at 15%. Feels like the FDP plus these two has a high chance of working, but does not seem like a natural coalition at all, and almost definitionally, the CDU, Green and SPD would be an alternative. 5. Feels like this is more or less a negative. It feels very unlikely that  a combination of CSU/CDU, Greens and SDP would work (maybe as high as 85/90%, and this does feel like a very acceptable coalition, so perhaps an 95% chance that they manage to put it together if they can, plus 5% chance it is CSU/CDU and FDP. That would get you to c. 10% chance of no Government. That actually sounds high, but the difficulties with some of the other coalitions and issues with AfD does make me comfortable being a bit higher than history. 6. SPD and FDP almost impossible to work. AfD being a dominant force would need polls to be well out and even if they got 30% of the vote, suspect that just ends up as no Government. Putting this as a 1%, \"anything can happen\" but very unlikely Together this would get me to:\n-Cdu only 16%\n- Green party only 15%\n- both 58%\n- Neither 1%\n- No Government 10% Not far from the consensus.

CDU + FDP has extrem low probability due to momentarily opinion poll shares of both parties. The voters of CDU are 60 or older.

And these come after a massive drop of support for CDU/CSU over the latest round of mishandling of the corona crisis. So normally I would expect them to bounce back. However, they seem intent to sabotage themselves further (inability to decide on a leader and more importantly unable to do the selection process sufficiently quietly)... There are two components driving the uncertainty of the election outcome: \n1) there is still half a year left in which we will (barring complete incompetence or active sabotage) at least largely deal with Covid (vaccinations will be done, ICUs and clinics more broadly will be back to normal operations). This should drive back some support to SPD and CDU, potentially taking from Greens, Liberals and Lefts.\n2) there is no clear leadership in the Greens. Especially none that has executive experience. If it looks like the Greens will be strongest party this might induce some hesitancy. On the other hand the question asks after the government and not the makeup of the Bundestag. In order for a new government to be seated (and the old government to be shown the door) the Bundestag has to elect a new chancellor [2]. This is a simple yes-no vote, where the Bundespr\u00e4sident is selecting the candidate [3]. Interestingly enough I didn't find a specific writeup in whom the president can nominate. But typically this is the leader of the strongest party. \nIn practice, this is slightly more convoluted as there is a phase where negotiations between the parties (technically the fractions, i.e. the representatives in the Bundestag of each party) happen. In these \"Koalitionsverhandlungen\" the plan for the government is written up and the ministries are assigned. This does not has constitutional standing and the Bundespr\u00e4sident could decide to not care and just nominate someone.\nIf the nominee fails to get a majority, the Bundestag has 14 days to nominate someone themselves, if this someone gets 51% he/she will have to be named chancellor (by the president), if that also fails a plurality would be sufficient, but the president could choose to dissolve the Bundestag and trigger a new election [4]. In practice this timeout only starts after the president nominates someone which (by convention) only happens after there were successful Koalitionsverhandlungen. This is a long way of saying: There is very little in terms of formal requirements to form a new government (the nomination of ministers is a simple announcement by the chancellor and consecutive naming by the president), but there is a lot of things that typically happen before one is formed. In particular, after the last election this took a very long time [5]. There are a number of reasons why there shouldn't be a large delay this time around:\na) it was the FDP which was indecisive and it cost them dearly. They won't repeat this kind of delay, where a government is nearly formed and then called off in the last second\nb) in 2017 it was clear the Merkel would stay on as chancellor, meaning that the government was still effective on the international level \nc) at the moment there is general discontent with the government (mostly the abyssal communication of the covid efforts) which raises the downside of a potential reelection. Still my guess of a new government being formed quickly (80%) is mostly guesswork. I assume that the new government has a majority in the Bundestag [6] and then either CDU or Greens will have to be in it (barring a collapse of both -> 0% neither). The CDU has more (executive) experience, is slightly stronger in the polls right now and has a realistic option of forming a government w/o Greens (CDU/SPD/FDP) leading me to favour w/ CDU w/o Greens over w/o CDU w/ Greens, but both is more likely than either of those options. The exact numbers are again mostly guess work. Things that would make me significantly reconsider this prediction:\n- A rebound (>2%) or massive drop (<-4%) in polling values of the CDU/CSU (if combined with a bounce for the FDP: Drop w/o CDU w/ Green otherwise increase both)\n- A massive increase (>5%) for the Greens (if combined with a bounce of the SPD: drop w/ CDU w/o Greens, otherwise increase both)\n- A significant drop (<-3%) for the Greens (increase w/ CDU w/o Greens, increase both) [1] https://www.bundestagswahl-2021.de/umfragen/\n[2] https://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/faqs/DE/themen/verfassung/regierungsbildung/regierungsbildung-liste.html\n[3] http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/gg/art_63.html\n[4] I don't think this ever happened\n[5] https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundestagswahl_2017#Regierungsbildung\n[6] technically there could be a Minderheitsregierung, but unless it is formed by the Greens I do not see anyone able or willing to form it."], [58028, "2021-04-18T07:42:50Z", [0.0, 0.25, 0.4, 0.0, 0.35], ""], [45594, "2021-04-18T07:39:49Z", [0.25, 0.1, 0.5, 0.1, 0.05], ""], [94837, "2021-04-18T06:26:44Z", [0.15, 0.09, 0.75, 0.0, 0.01], ""], [92079, "2021-04-18T00:42:30Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.0, 0.25], ""], [100619, "2021-04-17T22:56:08Z", [0.0, 0.35, 0.4, 0.0, 0.25], ""], [100608, "2021-04-17T21:46:16Z", [0.5, 0.1, 0.25, 0.0, 0.15], "CDU are not as dominant as they have historically been.

I'm confused about 2017, the article says \"The new government took office on 14 March 2018.\" but also says \"After the election, the 19th Bundestag had to hold its first sitting within 30 days. Until that first sitting, the members of the 18th Bundestag remained in office (Basic Law Article 39 Section 1 and 2).\" \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_German_federal_election\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_German_federal_election#Date Question is, when is the \"new government\" considered complete or official? Why does the article mention 14 MAR as the date the new government took office?\nFor example, a US Senator can be elected but still needs to be sworn in to take office.
