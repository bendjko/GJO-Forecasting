So supposing my beliefs about Cunningham's final vote share are distributed N(44,3) and my beliefs about Thillis's are distributed N(40,3), then my beliefs about the difference Cunningham - Thillis are distributed roughly N(4, 4). So 84% of my distribution lies above 0. This seems a little overconfident to me so I round down to 80. Let's try it the other way, per 538. Supposing Cunningham's final vote share is between 38 and 50, that Thillis's final vote share is between 34 and 46. Suppose a uniform distribution over both sets of values. What does that get us?
