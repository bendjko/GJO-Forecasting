Add in 30k-40k more Delta cases, and Canada could reach 2.0M by Dec 24. There is uncertainty in the number of Omicron cases today and in the doubling time for the country as a whole, and this calculation is very sensitive to different values for those numbers, but 2.0M is possible.

Ontario seems to have the worst Omicron situation so far in Canada, although there are limited data to go by. Let's focus on Ontario alone for a moment. On Dec 13, they had an estimated 1472 cases/day (https://covid19-sciencetable.ca/ontario-dashboard/ ). Let's estimate that 0.308 * 1472 = 453 were Omicron, and 1019 = ~1k were Delta (using https://twitter.com/DFisman/status/1470485244528795648 ). Based on similar calculations for earlier dates, Delta cases are still increasing. But supposing that Delta cases hold constant (I think it's more likely they'll continue to increase), then this would mean ~95% cases Omicron by Christmas => ~20k total cases/day, or ~19k Omicron cases/day, just in Ontario. So that could add ~90k Omicron cases in Ontario alone by Dec 24. Meanwhile, as of Dec 10, there are only 172k more cases to go for Canada to reach 2.0M (from official question resolution data), and 14 more days of data for bin 1. If one assumes that almost none of the 3.2k/day as of Dec 9 is due to Omicron, then we can conservatively project 3k * 14 = 42k additional Delta cases in bin 1, although there will likely be more (up to 50k?). (Note that I am assuming that Omicron cases don't replace Delta so much as become superimposed on Delta.) 172k - 42k - 90k = 40k. Given that there were 4692 cases on Dec 13 ( https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/epidemiological-summary-covid-19-cases.html ) and that Ontario represented only 31% of Canada's cases today, I think it would not be unreasonable to expect the rest of Canada to contribute 40k Omicron cases in bin 1.

So I think that at a minimum, the downside of the Delta wave will be prolonged. Vaccination levels are high and slowly increasing, and more kids are likely to be vaccinated soon. Mask mandates will help, too. A recent modeling paper suggested that unvaccinated people would get Covid every 16 months on average (range 3 months to 5 years), in the absence of mitigations; thus, it wouldn't be unreasonable to expect that substantially less than half of the unvaccinated people who have had Covid will get it again before April 23, 2022. I'm not sure what to think here. I wouldn't expect to see too far over 100k more cases by the end of the year. The seasonal peak for SARSCoV2 transmission seems to be in January in the N Hemisphere, so let's add some number of cases in bin 2. I wouldn't expect too much really big to go on after that for a while unless a new variant emerges that escapes a lot of immunity. By mid February, would it be too much to dare to hope that cases are <500/day? I could easily picture this question resolving in the last bin, but there's so much uncertainty, especially when it comes to variants, that I'll spread my forecast more widely. @paulm, aloha!

Juvenile vaccine (ages 5-11) has been purchased for first dose of all children in that age range and some provinces have started booking appointments. Although there will be more indoor activity mask mandates are still widely in place and vaccination rates are still climbing.
