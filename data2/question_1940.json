[1] In recent months the unemployment rate has followed a bit of a zigzag, dropping one month, increasing a bit the next, kind of a 2 steps down 1 step up pattern. I wonder if we'll see that happen here and it will stick at 5.4% or above for August. That's what I'm leaning toward right now, but I might change my mind later after considering whether UI ending in the listed states will result in a steadier downward trend.

Steady improvement in employment rate, dropping 0.15%/month on avg over last 6 months. Continuing this rate would put employment rate near 5.0%, well below the 5.4% target by September, though rate is likely to slow as we reach 'full employment'. JOLTS index suggests plenty of available jobs (near 5yr highs). Unemployment benefits are extended until September, meaning there will be a small increase in jobs after benefits expire but the timing is unlikely to impact the release in Sept numbers. This timing could cause the number of people searching for jobs to increase, artificially raising the unemployment rate. Currently 4M are not in the labor force due to Pandemic and declining, with a steady 2M marginally attached  and .5M discouraged - these numbers are probably not large enough to impact the employment rate denominator if conditions rapidly improved.  There is room to surprise on the upside, especially if more retail and services re-open. Retail sales have been strong, with inventories remaining low and strong demand throughout the supply chain, increasing demand for manufacturing and service workers. Restaurant walk-in and reservations have improved from -60% v 2019 to -30%, and are likely to continue to improve as weather warms and outdoor seating becomes more comfortable. Air travel bookings continue to improve slowly, suggesting demand for hotels is rebounding.  Downside risks are low, as risks of a virus surge decline with more vaccines delivered. Vaccine rollout has been strong in the US, with over 230M vaccines delivered thru April 26, with 95M (28% of pop) fully vaccinated and 140M partially vaccinated (42%). Availability of vaccine remains tight, but there may be headwinds on vaccine demand due to government distrust and skepticism. Unlikely to see surges of cases overwhelming current hospital capacity in the US. Public support for additional lockdown restrictions is unlikely, even if cases surge.

Inflation is now running above 3%, and as that becomes true on a year-over-year basis it's going to force interest rates on loans higher. Our economy is addicted to low interest rates, and higher interest rates and higher inflation will absolutely crash the economy. The everything bubble is popping in 2021. Just look at the last four or five months of CPI inflation, and look at how treasury yields have been rising. The economy can no longer handle normal interest rates. the government will respond by doing the only thing they can do which is create more money, which will cause more inflation.  There are also 5.2 million businesses out there that took PPP loans and kept their employees on staff so that they wouldn't have to repay those loans. So the government is essentially paying for the employee costs for those businesses, and the business can still claim the employee expense as a write-off.

But there's a lot of considerations with the pandemic to take into account. The article I linked below gets into it. My understanding is the survey response rates are down due to the pandemic and so it may not be as accurate as normal, among other reasons. Jason Furman estimates in the linked article that the \"realistic\" unemployment, meaning his estimation of what the employment number would be if the pandemic wasn't screwing up the measurement, is 8.3%. But many of these lost jobs are also temporary and could come back very quickly once the economy opens more. His estimate of the \"full recall unemployment rate\" is 6.9%. The big question is whether the trend in U3 unemployment reported by the BLS continues and underlying issues with the measure remain the same, or whether these issues resolve and the number better reflects the \"realistic\" measure. Additionally, if the economy reopens it could reflect the \"full recall\" number. And of course, all of these numbers are likely to decrease over time. https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economic-issues-watch/unemployment-continues-fall-workers-still-not-returning-labor My guess is that 6 months from now we'll be closer to the \"full recall\" number, and that with the pent up demand from stimulus packages and a majority of adults being vaccinated that number will have dropped a good amount. As an additional ballpark comparison, after the great recession the U3 unemployment reached 6.2% in April of 2014, and 6 months after that in October of 2014 it was 5.7%.
