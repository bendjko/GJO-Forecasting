As Zauchka notes, Trudeau has repeatedly been soft on China relative to the US/5 Eyes over trade and Huawei, not to mention the fracas over joint military exercises . [1] On the other hand, factors in favour of Canada announcing a diplomatic boycott include:\n- Canadian public opinion on China keeps falling [2] which could drive Trudeau to action (though it hasn't yet on the above items)\n- US President Biden and Trudeau are more aligned politically, which may make Trudeau more amenable to following the US's lead on this (vs were Trump in power) [1] https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/secret-documents-reveal-liberals-dismay-at-cancelled-china-exercises\n[2] https://angusreid.org/canada-china-huawei-meng-michaels-oct-2021/"], [42234, "2021-12-07T13:53:13Z", [0.15], "It seems the Liberal administration will be the primary decider:\n\u201cCanada is considering a similar boycott, but Sports Minister Pascale St-Onge said moments after the U.S. announcement that the Liberal administration in Ottawa had not yet decided whether to mirror the American action\u2026\u201d\nhttps://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/2021/12/06/china-warns-of-countermeasures-as-canada-considers-joining-us-diplomatic-boycott-of-olympics.html OTOH, the Liberals are a minority government propped up by the NDP.
