The 50 Dems are going to vote to convict, that much is certain. Mitt Romney is an almost sure bet as well, so it's gotta be at lest 51. Based on the vote that the impeachment was constitutional, we *might* expect 5 more Rs to jump on board. If so, that would get us to 56. Mitch McConnell is cagey - he's made a point of telling Senators to vote their conscience. He might be one more that we could add to the total, believe it or not, which would put us at 57.  That leaves 43 outstanding. It's fairly widely believed that the rest of the Rs are out - that their desire to get re-elected will outweigh any chance of voting to convict, no matter how convincing the argument is to impeach (the former president's base still holds pretty big sway). For 8 of the 43, it seems to me to be a 100% done deal that they won't vote to convict - they voted against certifying the election in the first place. That leaves 35. If we count the 56-57 above as sure things (admittedly, they're not), what are the chances that another 5-6 jump on board and put us over the 62 mark? Seems pretty unlikely, right? They're trading (at least in their minds) the power of their position as Senators for this one tiny, mostly meaningless vote, right?  What about to get to over the next hurdle? That'd take another 5-6, right (depending on whether we started with 56 or 57)? So that'd be a total of 10-12 out of 35, or 29-34% of the remaining \"in play\" Rs, nearly a third. Seems like a lot given the state of the rhetoric. Seems like a whole lot. If the vote happened today, I don't see either scenario playing out. Here's what might change my calculations: Trump coming out and saying something disastrous that the Rs can't ignore (and giving them an excuse to vote to convict) or a single powerful, or small group of less powerful, R Senators coming out publicly and providing cover.
