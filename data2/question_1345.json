Some days ago he even visited willingly the belgian judicial authority on the case, and he was set free of charges. Spain has demanded his extradition in two previous ocassions (to Belgium in 2017, to Germany in 2018) and both times the demands were rejected. Also, Belgium has refused extradition to spain historically, even in cases of ETA terrorist members.

We cannot rule ot the possibility of him being handed to spanish authorities by Belgium. After all, although very unlikely, it may happen after the judicial hearing scheduled on 29 October.\n2-. One situation that may cause him to came back is the current unrest of Catalonia, more specifically of Barcelona.

At this moment, the damages produced only by burning garbage containers is higher than one million euros.

The Central Government of Spain, dependent on the future elections in November, can not handle the electoral cost of giving amnesty to the sentenced independentist leaders.
