In fact, they actually came to blows once before, in 1984 when the Saudis shot down an Iranian jet . Granted, they stopped short of an actual shooting war, but the event the question postulates has happened at least once before. Although there was a brief rapprochement in the nineties, on the whole the conflict seems to have intensified in recent years.   This escalation seems at least in part to be a function of national-level leadership; Mohammed Bin Salman has pursued a fairly aggressive foreign policy  while Qassam Soleimani served as the human embodiment of an aggressive Iranian stance on the world stage.  But it would be unrealistic to attribute the pattern of escalation entirely to one or two individuals. The very fact that Soleimani was perceived as a national symbol and martyr suggests widespread institutional and popular support for Iran\u2019s aggressive policy. US foreign policy contributed to a middle-eastern power vacuum, which Iran has rushed to fill , which in turn has made Saudi Arabia more concerned.  Saudi Arabia and Iran both have a fairly wide reach, and their conflict extends throughout the middle east  and even into West Africa . The situation is aggravated by demographics. There is a significant Shia minority in Saudi Arabia, many of them concentrated in the eastern province of Qatif  (facing Iran) which is also where a large portion of Saudi\u2019s oil resources are, and where it has faced significant popular unrest.  Conversely, Iran has a western province (facing Saudi Arabia) populated by Arabs and occasional separatist outbursts.  In other words, there are many, many, arenas for proxy conflict and, by extension, possible flashpoints between the two powers. Given all these facts, my initial thought was that likelihood of conflict was high, somewhere in the 35% range. But further consideration showed: Originally I had thought falling oil prices would be more of a destabilizing factor. But, falling oil prices reduce the Saudi regime\u2019s ability to apply pressure (as pointed out by others on this site), and the only literature I could find suggested that a reduction in oil price does not actually make the regime more aggressive/desperate.  Everyone involved has a lot to lose. Both countries have a less-than-fully-secure ruling class; a war would not only be bad for their countries, it might be very bad for them personally, leading to exile, imprisonment, or execution for some percentage of the governing elite.  Lastly, as other have pointed out, all this sparring has taken place primarily through proxies and irregular forces. I think it\u2019s quite likely that elements of say, the Quds force and Saudi General Intelligence Directorate will shoot each other up at some point within the window. But an actual uniformed-military exchange that makes the evening news doesn\u2019t seem likely.\n"], [48778, "2020-08-10T21:12:55Z", [0.25], ""], [80764, "2020-08-10T18:21:05Z", [0.03], "Another small step down for passage of time."], [3429, "2020-08-10T15:58:56Z", [0.05], "maintaining current forecast"], [86658, "2020-08-10T10:54:08Z", [0.04], ""], [94908, "2020-08-09T19:00:18Z", [0.02], "Inside: To my knowledge, and after a pathetically cursory amount of googling, there has never been an officially acknowledged lethal confrontation between the national forces of Iran and Saudi Arabia. So I assess that an event of this nature could be counted as extremely rare, even during past periods of very high tensions. Further, both sides, and particularly Iran, have developed proxy forces and other levers through which they can conduct misattributable attacks, apply other means of pressure, and message/signal each other. It is my assessment that they would continue to use these means should one of the players desire to kill a member of the other nation's armed forces. Separately, the fact that they do not share any borders reduces, in my assessment, the chances of an accidental conflagration that could lead to a death. Inside: Tensions remain high at this time due to the ongoing conflict in Syria and the proxy war the two are fighting in Yemen. Additionally, numerous rounds of alleged back channel mediation have failed to calm tensions. However, tensions are not as high as they have been over the past year, such as during the \"Huthi\"-led oilfield attacks in Saudi. Even during those times, official lethal conflict between national military forces seemed only a remote possibility. Additionally, third country stakeholders, China, Russia, US, are all heavily incentivized to prevent Saudi and Iran from escalating to the point of direct, attributable, armed conflict. Ex-Factor: I could envision a scenario in which a sudden COVID flare-up drives domestic instability or leads to death of one or several of either country's aging leaders leads to a chaotic and rapid devolving of control over society writ large and/or the armed forces. From this kernel of instability, I could see several scenarios leading to rapid escalation culminating a lethal confrontation.

Prior to the Iranian revolution in 1979, relations were convivial, but the establishment of the Shia theocracy created a power struggle between them and the Saudi Wahhabi Sunni branch of Islam.\nThe issues between the two regional centres appear not to be based on religion or culture/language but on Iran\u2019s support of insurgent and radical groups and Saudi\u2019s pivot towards the US and Israel.\nBoth ascertain to be the power centres of the region.\nOvert conflict between the two has involved proxy wars in the Yemen and Syria, both supporting either side, giving the impression that they are avoiding direct conflict with each other\u2019s armed forces.\nCovid-19 has severely affected both countries.

Iran and Saudi Arabia have never declared war on each other. Conflict has always occurred indirectly via proxies. Iran has an overt foreign policy of exporting their revolution. Saudi Arabia is threatened by this and has directly intervened in countries such as Yemen. Saudi Arabia is becoming more aggressive. The Sunni-Shia divide is exaggerated but still significant. Lethal confrontation in Iran by Saudi Arabia... This could happen if:\n1.\tSaudi Arabia does a pre-emptive strike on Iran and claims responsibility/there is exceptional evidence it was them.\n2.\tSaudi Arabia does a retaliatory strike and claims responsibility/there is exceptional evidence it was them. 1.\nThis is extremely unlikely as it would destabilise the region even further, potentially start a conflict which they may lose, and portray Saudi Arabia as the villain. 2.\nSaudi Arabia blamed the 2019 Abqaiq drone attack on Iran. Whether Iran was responsible is another question and doesn\u2019t really matter, Saudi Arabia unquestionably blamed them. Despite the magnitude of the attack, it resulted in no direct conflict between the national military or law enforcement forces of Iran and Saudi Arabia anywhere (there may have been cyber-attacks, but this is unknown and not relevant to the question).  I believe the response from Saudi Arabia reduces the chances of future direct confrontation with Iran. However, the success of the attack may give the perpetrators confidence to carry out further actions. This may force a Saudi response to avoid becoming victims of similar attacks and this retaliation could happen in Iran. However, taking responsibility for retaliation would be unlikely. If a similar attack was carried out on Saudi Arabia, they would likely respond in a similar way and leverage foreign militias. This means no confrontation between their national military or law enforcement. However, this could cause escalation resulting in direct confrontation.  Lethal confrontation at sea... When looking at each country\u2019s naval capabilities, there is a clear imbalance of power. Iran has 406 vessels including 40 submarines and supremacy of the Persian Gulf. Saudi Arabia has 27 vessels and no submarines.  A confrontation at sea due to a mistake is unlikely as there is a very small chance that contact will be made (size of Saudi Arabia\u2019s navy). A retaliatory or pre-emptive strike at sea would not benefit Saudi Arabia because their navy would lose. A strike from Iran would not achieve much, they already have a significant advantage. A naval conflict would most likely happen as part of a much larger conflict, they would be at war. The same arguments I made in the previous section can also be applied to a naval scenario.   However, Saudi Arabia has plans to aggressively expand its naval capabilities, this could increase tensions dramatically. However, it will take decades to achieve Iranian numbers. Furthermore, American, and European support for Saudi Arabia is substantial when Iran is in question. If Saudi Arabia\u2019s allies attacked an Iranian vessel, it would be strategic to attack Saudi Arabian ships in response.  Qasem Soleimani... The death of Soleimani may lead to a reduction in Iran\u2019s aggressive foreign policy, leading to a lower chance of direct conflict between Iran and Saudi Arabia. He was regarded as extremely dangerous and extremely effective by America, Saudi Arabia and many others. To Iran he was indispensable, a tactical genius with huge influence. His replacement may be eager to make a statement. Soleimani was killed when he was on his way to de-escalation talks with his Saudi Arabian counterparts (allegedly). This may result in the positive dialect stalling, speeding up, or it may have prevented further escalation (no one knows). Iran Nuclear deal...   In 2018 the Trump administration abandoned the deal and placed very heavy sanctions on Iran. Tensions have risen as a result. An economic downturn caused by very high inflation, devaluation of their currency and trade restrictions have pushed Iran into a corner. With nowhere to go Iran has acted with increasing aggressiveness making the chances of conflict between Iran and Saudi Arabia more likely.  However, pressure could have the opposite effect and force Iran to negotiate. The same strategy brought N. Korea to the table; will it work for Iran? Possibly.  COVID-19... The virus has reduced the chances of a direct conflict. Governments are occupied, economies are weakened, and proportions of their militaries are domestically focused. The effects of the crisis will last for a few more months at least, there may be more waves.  Overall... A direct and lethal confrontation between Iran and Saudi Arabia before Jan 1st 2021 is unlikely in my opinion, even more unlikely when you limit the arena to just Iran and the sea. I believe tensions will continue to rise again after the effects of COVID-19 diminish. However, the conflicts will be played out indirectly through proxy wars. This may quickly change if either party crosses the line. This is not hard to imagine because tension and aggression has continued to rise for decades, tough sanctions on Iran are increasing pressure which could cause a miscalculation, and the extreme volatility in the region means anything can happen. Unfortunately, the Cold War in the Middle East has been slowly heating up.

Iran is currently one of the countries suffering the most from the COVID-19 pandemic. The most recent number of deaths in Iran has reached 1,556 with 20,610 people infected [1]. This has proven beneficial to the IRGC as they have been able to consolidate and grow their power inside the government; further, while the government's popularity has declined significantly due to their response to the virus, it is unlikely that the Iranian population will revolt or protest in large numbers due to the dangers presented by the COVID-19 virus [2]. Also, a stronger IRGC means less room for error as it is unlikely that IRGC leaders will do anything that would reduce the political gains they have made.  Further, the COVID-19 pandemic is having a significant financial impact on Iran. In fact, Iran made its first official request to the IMF in 60 years, asking for $5 billion in emergency loans along with the Gulf Cooperation Council providing medical aid along with a pledge of $10 million for Iran\u2019s healthcare system [3]. There are some analysts who assess that this could lead to a political breakthrough between Iran and Saudi Arabia [3]. Outside of the COVID-19 pandemic, Iran and Saudi Arabia have a long history of military conflict, not between their national militaries but instead through their proxy forces. For decades, Iran and Saudi Arabia were content with allowing proxy forces to fight battles far from the main territorial areas. However, as the 2019 Houthi rebel strikes (many analysts assess Iran conducted the strikes, but the Houthi took responsibility) on Saudi Arabian oil facilities show, tactics may be changing on both sides [4]. In fact, Iran has a history of avoiding direct conflict with other country's military\u2019s as shown by their retaliation against the United States following the assassination of  General Qasem Soleimani [5]. Further, the February 2020 elections resulted in a landslide victory for Iranian hardliners, which most likely means an increase in support for proxy forces and less reliance on traditional military shows of force, which would be a return to Iran\u2019s traditional methods of power projection [6]. Additionally, Iran has traditionally had strong ties with Russia and would not engage in a military conflict with Saudi Arabia without first consulting with Russia. Russia and Saudi Arabia are currently locked in their own economic war as Saudi Arabia has begun producing oil in mass quantities to crash worldwide oil prices. As this could benefit Russia more than Saudi Arabia, in the long term, it is unlikely that Iran will take any military actions that would threaten Russian strategic goals [7]. Further, Iran is a major purchaser of Russian military equipment and any international conflict between traditional militaries would make it difficult for Russia to continue to sell weapons to Iran due to outside pressures and this would dramatically impact Iran\u2019s ability to project military might because it is not able to produce all of its own weapons locally [8]. Finally, the US and Saudi strategy to defeat Iran has not been to conduct direct military actions against Iranian regular forces (The General Soleimani strike being an outlier), but to build coalitions and partnerships with other Arab nations and groups to combat Iranian influence in the region [9]. This also means that any direct military confrontation between Iran and Saudi Arabia would most draw the United States military into the fray, which is not something Iran is interested in having a direct engagement with [10]. Additionally, more US intervention in the Middle East does not benefit Saudi Arabia nor does it enhance their regional goals. If Iran and Saudi Arabia engaged in a conflict that resulted in the death of a regular military/police member, it could be an impetus for the United States to strike Iran, which could lead to increased Iranian strikes in Saudi Arabia [11]. The risk of death in this regard would also undercut Saudi Arabia\u2019s goal of flooding the market with cheap oil as a conflict in the region would drive oil prices higher than Saudi Arabia currently wants them [12].  Even though negotiations between Saudi Arabia and Iran continue to go nowhere, neither country seems willing to engage in behavior that will cause military-related deaths due to the damage that both countries know could occur to their infrastructure, economies, and people [13]. Further, other Gulf/Middle Eastern countries do not want to see a conflict between Iran and Saudi Arabia because of the same concerns mentioned previously. While Iran could target US/Saudi infrastructure before 1 Jan 2021, it is unlikely that they will allow strikes to kill American or Saudi troops [14]. Thus, I assess with 2% probability that there will be a lethal conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran. There is much more to analyze in regards to this question due to the nature of the conflict, the history of the two countries and the evolving situation in the world and the Middle East. It is likely that this assessment will change as the year goes on.

The attack on the Saudi oil field was possibly in connection with Iran and the late General Soleimani who was assassinated in early January. Soleimani was building militaries in surrounding Middle East countries including Yemen and the Houthis (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtzvIBAYP_8). Bearing that in mind with the extensive history between the two countries, the extended length of time of this year, and the small technical measurement of 1 fatality for a \"lethal confrontation\" I would venture to guess that this is very possible and somewhat probable of an occurrence.  What sets me back is the ability for both countries to continue these proxy wars, something that the NPR and CNN articles touched upon was that Saudi Arabia doesn't want to get pulled into a full out conflict/war. Additionally, Iran demonstrated extreme constraint after the US assassination of Gen. Soleimani which makes me think they will continue that restraint with Saudi Arabia and with the current US Administration.

The political and economic struggle is sharpened and defined by their religious differences but historically religious differences have been laid aside for peaceful coexistance.  Russian and US intervention from the time of Eisenhower and the Dulles brothers, has continued to exasperate tensions and the geopolitical divide.   Trumps decision in October to not retaliate against Iran for the Sept. 14 missile strikes against Saudi oil fields has lead to numerous conflicting reports of possible futures.  On Oct. 14, 2019 the New York times reported possible overtures by Saudi Arabia to de-escalate the conflict while on Oct 5, 2018, the National Interest reported that the there was an increasing growing possibility that Saudi Arabia could calculate that a military response is its only viable way forward.  Given the devastating consequences of increased escalation and the continued desire on the part of the American populace and the Trump administration for no continued physical involvement in the conflict, de-escalation is the way forward.  Given the tensions, the number of uncontrolled variables, crippling sanctions and intense national pride, it is unrealistic to think there is no chance of conflict.  As demonstrated by the drone strike on Soleimani, when the U.S. braced for Iranian drone and missile strikes (which did occur) and conflict felt inevitable, the situation changed on a dime. The ensuing accidental downing of Iranian Air Flight 655 diffused the situation immediately.  The latent effect of that strike continues to mellow the militaristic stance of the political elite and precipitate a quiet shift in direction.

Saudi Arabia, despite having the political and military backing (in terms of arms sales, at least) from the US, is concerned about being pulled into conflict with Iran because of US actions. It relies too heavily on the US for defense from Iran and possesses a fraction of arms in comparison to Iran (regardless of how modern these arms may be). In addition, there has been speculation recently (due to comments from diplomatic entities on both sides) on the potential for diplomatic talks to open up between the two rivals. Iran, on the other hand, is operating under a crippled economy and has yet to furnish a nuclear weapon (although it is making strides in completing one sooner rather than later). Additionally, Iran traditionally works through its proxies to carry out attacks against its enemies or opts to target infrastructure (i.e. oil infrastructure) in lieu of personnel. Its recent attack on US bases managed to produce zero US fatalities, an indicator of its willingness to carry out tit-for-tat attacks without prompting a larger, more direct confrontation with the US. Tie all of this information in with the fact that it is an election year in the US Saudi Arabia cannot count on continued, un-compromising support from the US should a progressive Democrat win the nomination. Finally, time is a major factor that I have historically discounted in these scenarios. For a direct, lethal confrontation to break out between the national military forces of either side to occur it would likely happen after an escalation of events that culminated in a \"straw that breaks the camel's back\" event.

The primary battlefield has been in other counties such as Yemen or Iraq.  For those reasons, the base rate is extremely low for the specified locations and is most likely between 5-10%.   Currently, Saudi Arabia does not appear in favor of conflict with Iran.  There was no military response to the Abqaaq attack, and the U.S. increased its number of forces by roughly 2K+ in the region to function as a deterrent.  Saudi Arabia will continue to rely on the U.S. for protection in the near to mid term.  It would take consistent escalating attacks or Iran getting a nuclear weapon for Saudi Arabia to reconsider its security posture.  Furthermore, Saudi Arabia's top priority is its Vision 2030 plan to diversity its economy and open its society to attract more foreign direct investment, not additional military conflict.   Iran's current near term priority is solidifying its position in Iraq and trying to get US forces expelled.

I believe Iran wants the same so as to encash the leverage they have built over Trump (and which wouldn't transfer over to the new Democratic president). Therefore, while at odds in Yemen today and for long time for bigger historical reasons, Iran and Saudis are aligned at this moment to let things cool down until they get sense of where Trump' reelection bid is.

If he seems on his way to get reelected then such a conflict is unlikely.\nTherefore, question is what are the chances polls will show that he is going to lose the electoral college vote in, let's say, September.

There would be a much bigger risk of a lethal confrontation occurring outside Iran, than inside Iran. A confrontation inside Iran seems very unlikely. What would the Saudi forces be doing in Iran? Iran could do a lot of damage to Saudi and has far more ground troops who are battle hardened and I suspect more effective than Saudi ground troops, so I would rule out an on the ground confrontation.  An Iranian missile strike  or air strike on Saudi ground would be excluded by this question, and so would the ground war in Yemen spilling over the border into Saudi.  It seems extremely unlikely that either Iran or Saudi would want to start a full scale war. Iran would assume the US would support Saudi and both Saudi and the US have far greater air power than Iran and would do a huge amount of damage to Iran, with Iran having no realistic chance of defeating Saudi in the long term. Likewise Saudi Arabia has weaker ground forces and would have no realistic chance of defeating Iran, and the US is unlikely to want to put the group forces into Iran that would be needed to help Saudi defeat Iran. If the US attacked Iran by air any deaths in Iran would not be be caused by Saudi Arabia. Its just possible that the US might attack Iranian nuclear facilities and if it did it might get Saudi to take part as a token part of an alliance. I suspect Saudi would be very wary of doing so, as its a lot nearer to Iran than the US and more likely to suffer retaliation.   So the only likely confrontation between Iran and Saudi would be at sea in some kind of accidental confrontation. e.g. where military boats or ship cross into the opposition's territorial waters. The Saudi's have no history of running boats close to Iranian waters (incidents in the gulf normal occur around the Straights of Hormuz not near Saudi waters.) If anyone tries to block or keep open the Gulf to oil shipments the action is likely to in the narrow part of the Gulf (The Straights of Homuz) and the protagonists  are more likely to be Iran and the UAE or Americans or some country that needs to protect its source of imported oil. If the Straights were closed by Iran, Saudi could export oil via its west coast, the volume would be lower than now, but the price would presumable be higher (due to no Iranian, UAE, Kuwaiti or Iraqi oil getting out) so the Saudi's would not be that desperate to attack Iran (assuming Iran had blocked the Straight)  So in summary it seems to me that Iran and Saudi will try and avoid lethal confrontations because they both have a lot more to lose than gain, and geography reduces the risk of an accidental conflict because neither has a reason to be in close proximity to the other at sea or in the air.

I wouldn't be surprised if as a way of rallying the people they concoct some type of confrontation against Saudi Arabia.  The Saudis are our allies in the region but they have also been harshly criticized. For  example: not doing anything about their wahhabi clerics who preach a radical version of Islam. Many of the 9/11 terrorists followed a wahhabi version of Islam. Not only that but then there was the whole debacle with the government ordered killing of Kashoggi on US soil and the use of US provided weapons and equipment to make the war in Yemen worse and make the humanitarian situation over there worse.
