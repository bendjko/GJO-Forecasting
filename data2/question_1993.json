The expectation is it will take 6 months to get to zero purchases. This is called the Taper.  The Fed raising short term interest rates is called Liftoff.  Powell expects Liftoff to be after the Taper is complete.  The Fed set 2 Taper framework tests, and these both have mostly been met: inflation is well above target and unemployment is approaching maximum. Inflation is high because of supply chain disruptions, and this will push the Fed to taper its bond purchases. The Fed needs to have Liftoff available to fight possible inflation.

I don't expect them to reduce bond purchases, really ever. There is no market for US debt anymore. The Federal Reserve has purchased more than 100% of newly issued treasuries for about the last 2 years. The US government is issuing continued increasing amounts of debt with all of their off budget emergency spending and I don't see this stopping. Someone has to buy the debt, and the only real purchaser is the Federal Reserve. China, russia, etc are slowly trying to sell off their holdings. Most others only buy US debt knowing that the FED will always be there to buy it up in the secondary market. And US government cannot afford to pay a market rate of interest on the debt so they have to keep the interest rate artificially low.  I do see a possibility that they reduce mortgage purchases. Of course, if they do, mortgage rates rise and the music stops. Housing prices fall which leads to decreased spending. I think they know this but they're trapped.  Another factor is that 3.5% of mortgages are currently in the covid forbearance program which is about to come to an end. If even a fraction of those end up going on the market or foreclosing that could be a major blow to the housing market. And the housing market fuels the stock market.  They will reduce mortgage purchases long before they raise the federal funds rate. I still think they understand it means the end... If bad news comes out like a bad jobs report it usually means that the markets go up because people interpret it to mean a better chance that the FED will continue stimulus. In other words, the markets are more concerned with whether the FED is going to continue easy money then they are concerned with actual fundamentals. This shows how artificial the economy is right now. I really think keeping asset prices inflated and keeping the stock market going is more important to the FED than reining in inflation, especially since they really can't rein in inflation. Reducing quantitative easing is not going to stop inflation, and raising the federal funds rate by 1% is not going to stop inflation.

What's important to note is that the government provided around 800 billion dollar in support (2). One of the reasons the QE programs took so long was the lack of more government stimulus combined with a slow recovery. In 2020 and 2021 so far the US government provided 4,1 trillion dollar in economic stimulus. (3) While the Fed provided around 2,7 trillion dollars in stimulus so far. (4) All in all total stimulus for Covid-19 is higher than it was during the Financial crisis and had been distributed in a shorter timeframe. The recovery also seems to be happening faster, which is normal given the nature of the decline in GDP this time: Lockdowns instead of structural errors in the economy and a lack of bank funding.  Inflation is also expected to return sooner. The previous QE round was reduced when gdp growth returned (>2%) and unemployment was below 7%. QE was reduced before the Fed started raising funding rates. As Yellen's recent spat shows, (5) inflation is seen as a risk. Raising rates might not be a popular option but that means QE will be scaled down as soon as inflation overreaches the Fed's 2% target and expectation also stay above 2%.    1:\nthebalance.com/what-is-quantitative-easing-definition-and-explanation-3305881\n2:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Recovery_and_Reinvestment_Act_of_2009\n3:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CARES_Act\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Rescue_Plan_Act_of_2021\n4:\nhttps://www.brookings.edu/research/fed-response-to-covid19/\n5:\nhttps://www.reuters.com/world/us/treasurys-yellen-interest-rates-may-need-rise-modestly-2021-05-04/"], [14027, "2021-05-11T19:10:35Z", [0.13], ""], [14027, "2021-05-11T17:01:09Z", [0.11], ""], [1333, "2021-05-11T10:34:46Z", [0.0], ""], [821, "2021-05-11T00:43:52Z", [0.08], ""], [70711, "2021-05-11T00:19:17Z", [0.0], ""], [77411, "2021-05-10T10:18:13Z", [0.14], ""], [1333, "2021-05-08T15:38:11Z", [0.0], ""], [87897, "2021-05-08T03:25:22Z", [0.15], ""], [691, "2021-05-07T17:24:30Z", [0.03], ""], [89013, "2021-05-07T03:28:22Z", [0.03], ""], [87897, "2021-05-07T03:09:24Z", [0.2], ""], [34959, "2021-05-06T15:59:19Z", [0.15], ""], [84630, "2021-05-06T13:07:54Z", [0.35], ""], [75948, "2021-05-06T04:28:11Z", [0.69], ""], [94872, "2021-05-06T04:24:14Z", [0.15], ""], [94872, "2021-05-06T04:23:32Z", [0.1], ""], [62255, "2021-05-05T15:46:54Z", [0.1], ""], [11289, "2021-05-05T15:02:50Z", [0.25], ""], [81057, "2021-05-05T06:50:44Z", [0.08], ""], [78587, "2021-05-04T19:34:29Z", [0.3], ""], [78587, "2021-05-04T19:20:28Z", [0.9], ""], [81187, "2021-05-04T13:37:59Z", [0.0], ""], [94872, "2021-05-04T04:56:02Z", [0.2], ""], [1646, "2021-05-03T21:01:33Z", [0.01], ""], [2895, "2021-05-03T20:46:50Z", [0.1], "Powell has consistently signalled an institutional preference for a period of catch up inflation to bring mid to longer-term rolling trend to a cumulative 2% or a bit more.
