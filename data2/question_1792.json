I'm rounding this down to %1. There are four successful attempts by the military to overthrow a Turkish government since 1950: 1960 and 1980 were direct coups, while in 1971 and 1997 a government was forced from power by softer military interference. Two coup attempts in the 1960s and one in 2016 failed, while in 2007 a military interference attempt through soft power during a constitutional crisis was unsuccessful. Consequently we may estimate that since the institution of free elections in Turkey in 1950, there has been a %11.4 chance that some kind of military interference in politics takes place every year, and out of these half of them result in the incumbent government losing power. Adjusting for the 7 and a half months remaining, this gives a %3.6 base chance that Erdogan is removed from office through military interference until 15th July 2021. Because of the measures taken to address precisely this possibility after 2016, I'm cutting this down to %2. (It's worth keeping in mind that such measures didn't save the Menderes government in the 1950s from a military overthrow in 1960, so I don't want to overdo the correction.) Finally, there's the possibility that an early election will be called before 15th July 2021 and that Erdogan will lose this election. Turkey has had 9 early elections since 1950, and 2 of these has resulted in the government who called for the elections losing power. This gives a base rate of 2/70 = %2.8 per year for this event, so adjusting by the amount of time remaining gives a base rate of %1.75.  I adjust this base rate down to %1 given the recent pronouncements of the subject of an early election by the president, which make an early election comparatively more unlikely but not impossible. Adding all of these together gives a %4 chance that Erdogan ceases to be president before 15th July 2021."], [62808, "2020-12-02T22:38:30Z", [0.02], ""], [97157, "2020-12-02T10:25:33Z", [0.32], ""], [86715, "2020-12-02T03:58:05Z", [0.02], ""], [1333, "2020-12-01T15:46:18Z", [0.72], ""], [81334, "2020-12-01T15:40:11Z", [0.05], "Reading through my back-log of economists since summer and TUrkey's interventions in Syria and Iraq, Erdogan is really making it hard to think of ways for him to leave the presidency. A look at the data: (https://sites.psu.edu/dictators/) If we take as a starting point the failed coup in 15/7/2016 for when turkey became ruled by an autocrat, this dataset can help us estimate how long these regimes typically last. OUt of the 280 regimes (some without end date)in the dataset 77 ended within 5 years, 28%. 1) 33 out of these 77 ended with a military coup.

Hence no need for me to type out my own essentially copy and past reasoning.  The only path to removal of Erdogan seems to be a coup, and given the last failed coup, Erdogan has already made that path significantly more difficult. But in that region, a coup cannot be ruled out completely.  That being said, a small amount of research revealed this, from the highly reliable euobserver news website.\nhttps://euobserver.com/foreign/144366\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EUobserver (if it's good enough for EU officials to take seriously, it's good enough for me) The source of this article seems to be an EU intelligence report.\n\"\nBut the IntCen report on the coup, dated 24 August 2016, and seen by this website, said it was \"unlikely that Gulen had the abilities and the capacities to take such steps\", even if some individual Gulenists were involved in the attempted overthrow.\nAccording to available information, a far-reaching purge of the GM's [Gulen movement's] followers in the armed forces and the gendarmerie was planned for early August 2016 based on lists produced by the MIT [Turkish intelligence]. Some arrests were already planned for 16 July, the day after the coup attempt\", the EU report added.\nThe coup was just the catalyst for the crackdown prepared in advance,\" the IntCen report said.\"\n\"\nApparently, the coup was to some extent government controlled and latest intelligence assessments are that Erdogan permitted it to happen to justify has later crushing of all potentially independent institutions in Turkey. So even that coup probably wasn't a full \"normal\" coup. That being said, it is still possible Turkey had organised the crackdown and the coup itself simply caused Erdogan to start the crackdown early and immediately. So a genuine coup cannot be ruled out.  I would have attached 5% probability to a coup, but given the EUObserver article, that gets reduced to 2.5%. The last remaining path to Erdogan no longer being in power is, once again, his death. \nErdogan is 66 years old. The deadline is 1 3/4 years. Actuarial tables show his probability of death in 1 year is 1.7% and the probability of death in the subsequent year is 1.8%, which we multiply by 3/4 giving 1.35%. Summing the two makes 3%.

Turkey seems to be able to use if close relationship with President Trump as a means to ignore EU criticism. Erdogan has also been able to use his relationship with Putin to strengthen regional policy issues.\nBut leveraging these relationship also depend on Trump winning the 2020 Presidential Election.
