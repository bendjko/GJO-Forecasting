That being said, before analyzing the data, I did not know how large daily changes in the positivity rate could end up being, Methodology First, after downloading the underlying data from COVIDTracking.com, I was able to recreate the positivity rates shown on covidexitstrategy.org by taking the rolling 7 day sum of positiveIncrease divided by totalTestResultIncrease. From this data, I constructed a time seri\u00aces per state of the positivity rate. Next, for analysis, I isolated data from July 1st, to August 29th, which at the time of writing is the most recently available data. This was an assumption based on the following rationale; (1) By July most states had implemented policies around coronavirus spread prevention, which would not have been as evident in early months in the crisis such as April, (2) the amount of testing done in more recent months would more accurately represent the number of testing we can expect over this week. On this subset of data, the daily standard deviation for each state was computed. After this was done, I wanted to decrease my universe of states to only include likely candidates to have a greater than 0.10% positivity rate. All states that were already above 0.10 made my new subset. Further, any states that were currently below 0.10, but within 2 daily standard deviations away from the 0.10 threshold, were added to the list.  Using this criteria, I end up with 27 states. The final step I did was to run a monte carlo simulation whereby for each state, I draw a random samples from a normal distribution of mean 0, and standard deviation corresponding to that state\u2019s standard deviation of daily changes in the positivity rate. These values were added to the latest positivity rate known on August 29th to predict the future positivity rate. This process was repeated 100,000 times after which the distribution of the number of states in the following categories; 6 to 11, 11 to 15, and 16-20.  Further Improvements Most of the improvements I would make in regards to my analysis revolve around the various assumptions I made. First, the date range I used for analysis, July to August 29th, was based purely off of intuition and my observations from following news around the covid-19 crisis. An improvement to this assumption would be to gather the exact dates where states implemented their covid policies, and add some time lag to these dates to account for the time it takes for these policies to start impacting results. Secondly, I assumed that states which were more than two standard deviations below the threshold were unlikely candidates, however, the assumption here was that the daily change in positivity rates was normally distributed \u2013 implying that a two standard deviation was quite unlikely. This assumption might be false, and a proper analysis of the daily changes can engender a more insightful distribution. This assumption flowed over to my monte carlo simulation where I drew random data points from a random distribution.  As a next step, I will update my predictions with the latest data on the 31st.

I also tried sampling across states (meaning that tomorrow's simulated positivity rate change could be a historical change from another state).  For each of these methods, I also tried using percent changes in the positivity rate as opposed to absolute changes. I also broke down the daily changes in the positivity rate into a national trend and state specific trends, as I was concerned that the methods above might underestimate the variance in the outcome by assuming each state's positivity rate changed independently. However, these did not produce significantly different results.  My simulations suggested that the 11-15 probability might be a bit higher than 95%, but I underweighted my forecast because there is additional uncertainty in testing results early in the week. Generally speaking, weekend data is of lower quality, so the recent positivity rates are slightly weaker-than-normal predictors of future rates. While this has not occurred as frequently during the past two weeks, there have been several precipitous drops in the positivity rate, so a sub 11 outcome is not out of the question. On the other hand, there is usually a backlog of cases after the weekend, which can increase the positivity early in the week.

Therefore, it seemed unintuitive to try to fit a sophisticated logarithmic model or time series regression looking back historically over a significant period of time for a couple of reasons. 1.) The variance in our model prediction may far exceed the amount of variance remaining before the settlement date 2.) The most recent \"moves\" in the Covid positivity rate by day are intuitively a better prediction of tomorrow's move (historical moves looking back across a longer time may not be a good reference point for this). Thus, I will be looking at moves over the course of the last 10 days, and discount moves prior to that as a poor sample for our population parameter (today's move). Important to note: there is a trade-off here between sample size and representativeness of our sample. Last week's moves may better predict tomorrow's move better than last month's moves, but you will be drawing from a smaller sample and thus have greater variance. I pulled the data and calculated the mean change in positivity rate as well as the std dev (volatility) of the change in positivity rate over 1 day.

Subsequently, tried to both support and contradict our initial hypothesis with quantitative as well as qualitative metrics. Finally, we looked at edge cases to fine-tune our prediction values between the buckets. Data Cleaning: As mentioned in the question, there were 6 states ('AS','DC', 'GU','MP', 'PR', 'VI') that needed to be deleted from the dataset as they are not considered. This cleaning process was crucial given that these \"states\" would have materially altered the predictions. Baseline Case: To derive our baseline case, we recreated the positivity rate values used in the study. The values are computed on a 7-day rolling basis, thus we took the last 2 months and computed the 7-day rolling averages. In a second step, to account for the variability in the values, we also computed the 7-day rolling standard deviations for each state specifically. After this, we made the assumption that these each positivity rate value is normally distributed around the mean as of latest available date with a standard deviation computed according to the 7-day rolling window. Given that we have multiple days, we scale the standard deviation accordingly (standard deviation scales with the square root in time).  Finally, to get a probability distribution around the number of states having a positivity rate of over 10.0%, we simulated 1,000,000 paths (with the inputs aforementioned). Benchmark updating: Given that the vast majority of the outcome has already been observed (5 data points of the total 7 data points are already known), we have an elevated threshold for other metrics to alter our hypothesis. First, we considered the fact that the two remaining days are weekends, thus there might be a seasonality effect that might skew the outcome. As already observed in the peak times in major states, there has been a statistically different number of cases on weekends versus weekdays. This is not surprising given that people have more time on the weekends to get tested. However, after having looked at the current data, there seems to be no significant difference between weekends and weekdays, thus we do not need to materially change the assumed underlying distribution. Furthermore, we also tested different underlying distributions to see if those materially change the outcome, but those seemed to have proven robust as well. Last, we parsed through current news to detect any possible testing related issues. Even though, there has been some testing related issues in the past, those have happened long enough to not affect our results materially. Edge cases: Finally, we looked at the edge states. We see that there are currently 10 states (AL, FL, IA, ID, KS, MO, ND, NV, SC, SD) that are above 10.0% positivity rate even if they report both days 1 standard deviation events. Also, even if we look at 1 standard deviation moves both days for the up direction, there are only 5 more additions to the states list, thus limiting the possible outcomes even more to the 11-15 node. However, the up node seems to bear more risk than the down node, thus we adjust our probabilities to be skewed towards more states than less states.

Positivity rate is the positive cases that have been surfaced from testing: [Positive Cases / Total Tests], rolled on the past 7 days [1].  This data is updated daily and comes from the COVID Tracking Project.  Broad view: I downloaded the data from [2] and computed the time series of the 7 day rolling positivity for each U.S. state. On the last month, the number of US states with more than 10% positivity has an average of 12.1 and a std of 1.3. Week to date, the covid+ has stabilized between 12 and 13.  Sub-Problems Decomposition: Let's examine this question per state with p the probability of a state to have a positivity rate > 0.10 on Sept 1st. I additionally make the hypothesis of the independence of states in term of positivity rates. I categorize the states into 3 buckets: \n- 8 states have a positivity rate > 0.1 + 1std (computed on a 1 month horizon, seems reasonable regarding this rate speed of evolution) and their time series clearly show an upward linear trend -> p = 1\n- 32 states have a positivity rate < 0.1 \u2013 1std -> p = 0 \n- The remaining 10 states are trickier: AL, AR, AZ, GA, HI, KS, MN, MS, NC, TX. For those names I assign some rough probabilities given the trend of their time series as well as their histogram distributions, giving more value to the near term data (total horizon is again 1 month). As this part of the calculation is kind of arbitrary I chose my probabilities with a 0.1 precision. I then consider each {state i has positivity rate>0.10} to be an independent Bernoulli trial which takes the value 1 with probability p_i. The sum of these random variables is a Poisson binomial distribution. The distribution's mean and variance are intuitive given the independence of the variables mean=5 and variance=0.74. As there is no closed formula for this distribution I run Monte Carlo simulations (100,000). and obtained the following results\n11 states: 2%,\n12 states: 25%,\n13 states: 46%,\n14 states: 22%,\n15 states: 4%\n16 states: 1% Consequently my final forecasts are 99% for 11-15 states and 1% for 16-20%.

I first looked at the last available data point on rolling 7-day average positivity rate because we are only two days until the final prediction date. I first calculate the daily standard deviation on this statistic (rolling 7-day positivity rate) in the past 30 days. I choose 30 days as a time frame because recent data is much more relevant in terms of coronavirus outbreak.  I first filter every state that has a rolling positivity rate one standard deviation above 10% on August 28th, which gives me 10 states.  All of these states are well above 10%, and the borderline ones have a upward linear trend. Thus, I am 100% sure that these ten states' rolling 7-day positivity rate will be above 10%. in two days.  I then look at states that are within one standard deviation above the 10% benchmark, which gives me 2 states - AL and KS. Out of the two states, KS has a consistent decreasing trend, which moves around 0.002% every day. It is unlikely KS will have a rate below 10% in two days. AL has been fluctuating. Thus, I assign AL a 50% probability to be above 10% in two days. Now, my prediction is 10.5 states. Finally, I look at states that are within one standard deviation below the 10% benchmark, which gives me 10 states. Assume normality and unchanging mean considering our short time period until the deadline, about 34% of these states will move up one standard deviation.  Now, my prediction is 13.5 states.

The most likely path to 6-10 states appears to be Arkansas, Kansas, and Florida all falling below 10%. Arkansas appears to be a coin flip right now. I would put the probability of Kansas falling below 10.0% at <10% given that its weekly rolling average has remained between approximately 11 and 12.5% for the past two weeks. And similarly, Florida I think also has a sub-10% probability of dipping below 10 given that its positivity rate has been decreasing more or less linearly for the past two weeks at a rate of 0.24 percentage points per day, so it is not on track to go below the 10 mark for another 10.5 days. If we assume these three events are independent we can see that the probability of all three states falling out of the money in the next 2 days is less than 0.5*0.1*0.1 = 0.005. Of course, there are a few other conceivable paths to 6-10: Arkansas+Kansas+Idaho and Arkansas+Kansas+Texas seem about as likely given that Idaho and Texas, while half a percentage point above Florida, have seen more steep declines in their positivity rates recently than Florida has.  I think we can discount the possibility of any state from Missouri on up dipping below 10.0% in the next two days. I think 3.7+ percentage points is too much ground to cover in just 48 hours. Thus, we have 3 roughly equally probable scenarios for the question to settle at 6-10, for a total probability of 1.5%. I think this can be rounded down to 1% as my initial estimates of 10% independently for Kansas/Florida/Idaho/Texas seems a bit generous.  This 1% seems good to keep as there is a small possibility of a data entry error throwing off the stats as well. Similar reasoning as above suggest that the most likely path to 16-20 is for Kansas and 3 or more of (Georgia, Nebraska, Hawaii, Utah, Wisconsin, and Minnesota) to climb above 10% by 9/1. I think very generously the probability of any given one of those states climbing above 10% is 0.15 based on the fact they've all had very flat or slightly downward trending positivity rates for the past two weeks. Using a binomial model with p=.15 and n=6, the probability of any of 3 or more of them reaching above 10 is 0.047. Divided by 2 because of Arkansas gives us a probability of 0.023, or about 2%. I think my conservative-ness on the 15% estimate offsets the fact the states are probably not completely independent and there is some trivial probability of a data entry error. Thus, my prediction is 1% for 6-10, 2% for 16-20, and 97% for 11-15."], [31275, "2020-08-29T19:59:01Z", [0.0, 0.07, 0.93, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [95347, "2020-08-29T19:46:53Z", [0.0, 0.02, 0.97, 0.01, 0.0], "I looked at the percent changes in positivity over the past 13 data points and for each state, generated a random sample of 100,000 percent changes from this original data.

Finally I summed over the state samples to obtain a sample of the number of states with a rate greater than 10%. All of this work led to the obvious conclusion that the number in two days is extremely likely to be between 11 and 15 states. I did increase the chances for 6-10 and 16-20 states by 1% each to account for a bit more uncertainty. While my model basically suggested only one of these ranges was possible, it did give some nuance for numbers within that range.

There were 10 such states. Next, I focused on the \"iffy\" states (those hovering within one std dev of 10% positivity). There were 8 such states (AL, AR, AZ, GA, HI, KS, MN, UT).

Looking at performance from other countries, its much easier to bring the test positivity rate down as compared to bringing the infections down. Many countries are now able to do this in relatively short period of time (using combination of RT-PCR, Antigen testing). India is shooting for test positivity rate no higher than 5%, and that seem to be reasonable limit.  There is no shortage of test kits now. Its only matter of government focus and priority now.  I see many more state governments are more willing to act now and not looking towards the federal government.

Contenders to a higher than 10% positivity rate although still below the threshold are in particular: - Arkansas (8.6%)\n- Kansas (9.4%)\n- Tennessee (8.0%) Other states with increasing rates with already above 5% positivity rate are: - California (6.9%)\n- Delaware (5.4%)\n- Indiana (5.2%)\n- Iowa (7.4%)\n- Louisiana (7.6%)\n- Missouri (5.1%)\n- North Carolina (6.9%)\n- Ohio (5.6%)\n- Oklahoma (5.4%)\n- South Dakota (6.8%)\n- Wisconsin (5.4%) Strict measures will be necessary to contain the spread. The current development will ring the alarm bells soon enough to pressure decision makers to impose the necessary restrictions. Question is, will these hold on until September? Or will we see restrictions imposed in the coming weeks lifted on time to see case numbers rise at the end of August again? Another major issue concerns the testing. Spread of COVID-19 might lead to prioritize testing of those groups that are highly vulnerable - or those with the most severe conditions which eventually results in higher positivity rates.

Nine others would cross the 10% threshold in the timeframe on current trajectories and two are possible, but uncertain.  That gives 21 as the base rate on current trends.  Test numbers are increasing in almost all states; constraints in the availability of tests seem likely to bite soon.  Without adequate testing renewed lockdowns (at least partial) will be required to stay ahead of the spread.  In any case, the general pattern appears to be that when test availability is constrained, they are prioritised towards higher risk populations.  That would tend to support the general trend towards rising Covid positivity rates as those tested are more likely to have the disease.  However over a two month period, strict lockdowns could flatten the curve as happened in the Northeast from March (although that really took at least a month to become evident).  Overall, it is likely some of the states now on a trajectory towards >10% will be able to flatten the curve, but others may actually pick up speed that are not there yet.  The partisan nature of acceptance of public health measures will be a significant factor in which states take which route.
