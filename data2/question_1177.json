See here for more info: https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/841007 Other judgments: \n- EWP estimate at 5.9%. [1] \n- Crowd forecast here is 3%. Inside view:\n- EWP list Boko Haram killings already as a campaign of mass killing, as well as the state's security response. [2] \n- There seem to be some other forms of communal violence, between herders and farmers [3] . Adding up the \"Herder-farmer conflicts and communal conflicts\" listed on Wikipedia for the past six months I get something like 400 [4]. Those seem to have been perpetrated by different groups though. Just taking the largest group adds up to something like 200 killed. From the other Wikipedia page: \"According to the Global Terrorism Index, Fulani militants were the fourth deadliest terrorist group in 2014, using machine guns and attacks on villages to assault and intimidate farmers. After killing around 80 people in total from 2010 to 2013, they killed 1,229 in 2014. Most deaths occurred in the Nigerian Middle Belt, in particular in the states of Benue, Kaduna, Nasarawa, Plateau and Taraba, which recorded 847 deaths. The state of Zamfara, in the northern belt, recorded 229 deaths. In addition to terrorist attacks, Fulani militants were also involved in non-state armed conflicts with groups from Eggon, Jukun and Tiv farming communities. These conflicts resulted in over 800 deaths by 2015. The year 2016 saw further incidents in Agatu, Benue and Nimbo, Enugu State. In April 2018 Fulani gunmen killed 19 people during an attack on the church, afterwards they burnt dozens of nearby homes. In June 2018, over 200 people were killed and 50 houses were burnt in clashes between farmers and Fulani cattle herders in Plateau State. In October 2018, Fulani herdsmen killed at least 19 people in Bassa.[14] By 2018, over 2000 people were killed in those conflicts. On 16 December 2018, Militants believed to be Fulani Herdsmen attacked a village in Jema'a, killing 15 people and injuring at least 24 others, the attack occurred at a wedding ceremony.\" So there seems to be precedent for them killing over 1,000 in a year. Overall judgment:\n- EWP seems to be about right with 2x base rate from what I've read: 5%.
