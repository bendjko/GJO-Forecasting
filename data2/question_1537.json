Even if it were, competent people who suffer a momentary lapse can recover immediately and make themselves clear. This is also not an isolated instance. He is constantly talking gibberish, making dumb remarks, (such as calling a questioner at a town hall a \"lying two-faced pony soldier\"), or otherwise demonstrating that he no longer has any ability to make sense while speaking in public. In this case, Biden is almost certainly reading (or supposed to be reading) from a teleprompter, and he can't even do that. So he cannot speak extemporaneously, and he cannot speak from prepared remarks. I suppose some forecasters might argue that Biden's handlers and advisors will be running things in a Biden administration. That could be correct; we can only hope so. However, before there is a Biden administration, Biden has to actually win the election. So in my opinion, the real matter we are forecasting on this question has nothing to do with delegate counts (he doesn't have enough to win on the first ballot, and I think that the DNC will find a way to keep it that way), nor has it to do with previous elections or nominating processes. It has to do with whether the Democratic Party thinks that it can win the presidency with this candidate. Neither party has ever been in a situation where the person who is publicly touted as the presumptive candidate is clearly cognitively impaired. Maybe he will be the candidate. But there are three months until the convention, and there has got to be growing trepidation among the Democrats that they are in danger of nominating the candidate who is incoherent.

She's a credible politician, even though she didn't do very well in the primaries, and she may appeal to some Sanders voters, who will be angry that Bernie doesn't get the nomination if Biden is thrown overboard. She probably doesn't have any real general election appeal, but that may not matter, and in any case, no Democrat really does have such appeal. But it will probably be someone else altogether, maybe Hillary Clinton. Edit: I see a lot of forecasters below accepting the premise that Biden has it in the bag. Maybe so, but the original appeal of Biden was his \"electability.\" He's a blithering idiot (as opposed to an merely being an ignoramus, which was his original niche). and with the Tara Reade accusation, he may wind up being perceived by the electorate as a scoundrel. It seems to me that every day his electability - to the extent it existed in the first place - diminishes. And if this is the case, there is absolutely no reason to run him as the candidate. I think it was obvious from the start that Biden's candidacy had no momentum or enthusiasm behind it. It was only the machinations of the DNC prior to South Carolina that eliminated all the \"spoiler\" candidates and mobilized the party regulars behind him in order to stop Sanders. All along, Biden's candidacy was greeted with resignation by Democrats, because they convinced themselves they could find no one better.

GJ Open predicts 80%/20% chance for Biden/Sanders winning the nomination. How do we reconcile these predictions? There is likely some type of correlation between these three predictions. Furthermore, the 538 model does not directly equate with the question at hand; it does not attempt to predict the nominee in the event of a brokered convention (https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-fivethirtyeight-2020-primary-model-works/). A naive combination of the probabilities for Biden winning the nomination would be: (83% + 89% + 80%) / 3 = 84%\nA similar calculation for the probability of Sanders winning the nimation would be: (14% + 2% + 20%) / 3 = 12% What do we do with the remaining probability (4%)?

I'd love to hear what others think. A couple of angles: Let's say that 10% of the population gets COVID-19 between now and the convention. It could easily be much higher or lower. I'm going to guess that politicians are nearly certain to be exposed in that scenario given their frequent travel and meeting with so many different people every day. THis makes sense given the fact that so many prominent politicians worldwide have come down with COVID in a relatively short period. So it comes down to what fraction of the population has natural immunity.  I'm not sure how that works out but let's say 10-50% (I'll call it 25%) chance of Biden (or Trump or Bernie or Warren) getting it. In that case the numbers aren't great: ~20+% chance of a very serious illness involving a hospital stay that could last weeks. That would be a really serious blow to his nomination even if he had the most delegates.  Also, given his age, there's a 5-10% chance of death. So you add those up and you get something like a \n~7.5% = ~5% + 2.5%.  In that case it would be hard to argue against Bernie, and he could win outright if Biden gets sick soon. More likely it would lead to a contested convention. Bernie's probably at higher risk. Warren maybe somewhat lower. Trump about the same.

Of course, the republicans wanted Bernie to win the nomination in 2016, and want him to win in 2020.    Recently, Bernie doubled down on pro-Castro comments, which did not impress too many democrats.  Also, I think some democrats are starting to see Bernie as a \"burn down the village to save it\" kind of guy.  This is due in part to insistence that the party change convention rules to favor his election.  This smacks of Trump-ism.  Hence, I expect Bernie to finally start to fall in the polls. Biden on the other hand is doing better.  He has never done well in national elections.  He just does not excite voters despite his outstanding resume for a presidential candidate.

All the moderates are flawed in some way: Biden is prone to gaffes, Buttigieg is inexperienced & gay (a serious problem for voters in \"purple states\"), Klobuchar is uncharismatic, and Bloomberg is a New York billionaire who can appear smug.  Bloomberg, however, cultivates the image of the reluctant civil servant. During his tenure as NYC's mayor, he did not take advantage of his position to enrich himself. Instead, he contributed billions (with a B) to liberal causes over the past 15 years (gun violence - which predominately affects blacks/hispanics, environment, public health, education) AND helped Democrats get elected in purple states (VA, PA). This means a LOT of influence. And he can continue to spend his personal wealth on targeted advertising. I think Bloomberg will be the dark horse nominee if Sanders fails to win in the first round.
