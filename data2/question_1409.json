The court heard arguments on Dec. 2 in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Inc. v. City of New York, New York. Rather than focus on the Second Amendment, much of the discussion centered on whether the court should even discuss gun issues at all.\nInstead, the court focused on whether the repeal of the law at the center of the case made the issue moot. \u201cWhat you\u2019re asking us to do is to take a case in which the other side has thrown in the towel and completely given you every single thing you demanded,\u201d Justice Sonia Sotomayor told lawyers for the plaintiffs. The New York State Rifle and Pistol Association (NYSRPA) is challenging a New York City law that severely restricted the transport of firearms outside the home. In June, after the Supreme Court agreed to hear NYSRPA\u2019s appeal, the city repealed the law. The justices focused for much of the hearing on whether the case was moot. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg quickly redirected the lawyer for the gun owners, Paul Clement, away from discussing the Second Amendment issues. Instead, Ginsburg went right to the mootness question. https://www.opb.org/news/article/us-supreme-court-gun-regulations-rights-control-cases/ https://nypost.com/2020/04/14/supreme-court-will-hear-cases-via-teleconference-for-first-time/"], [1333, "2020-04-14T14:47:06Z", [0.0], ""], [87283, "2020-04-13T16:14:40Z", [0.02], ""], [1034, "2020-04-12T00:18:17Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2020-04-09T14:05:03Z", [0.1], ""], [87105, "2020-04-09T09:47:25Z", [0.8], ""], [1034, "2020-04-08T21:46:08Z", [0.0], ""], [40959, "2020-04-07T15:58:27Z", [0.03], ""], [1034, "2020-04-06T23:32:55Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2020-04-05T09:25:56Z", [0.0], ""], [1333, "2020-04-04T18:30:11Z", [0.01], ""], [86946, "2020-04-04T03:19:07Z", [0.88], ""], [1034, "2020-04-03T23:00:38Z", [0.0], "Miller, S., A. & Keehan, K., A.

Retrieved from\nhttps://www.law.com/thelegalintelligencer/2020/03/04/ny-firearm-restriction-faces-mootness-challenge-in-supreme-court/ The Constitution permits judges to adjudicate only actual, ongoing cases or controversies. A case can become \u201cmoot,\u201d even on appeal, when the issues litigated are no longer in dispute\u2014for example, when a challenged law is repealed. However, there are exceptions to the mootness doctrine. For example, a government entity\u2019s voluntary cessation of challenged activity will only result in a dismissal for mootness if there is no reasonable expectation that the challenged violation will resume. That is the issue in New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. City of New York, a case currently before the U.S. Supreme Court. = Mogilnicki, E., K.  & Schultz, A.

City of New York, No. 18-280\u201d. Higgins (2019) Dec. 2, stated that: WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court seemed unlikely to deliver a major win for gun-rights activists during arguments on Monday in the first significant Second Amendment case the justices have heard in nearly a decade (Para. 1). While court conservatives including Justices Neil Gorsuch and Samuel Alito seemed eager to use the case to address the reach of the Second Amendment, it appeared likely after an hour of arguments that Chief Justice John Roberts would side with the court\u2019s liberals to dismiss the matter altogether as moot in light of the repeal of the regulation (Para. 3). A decision in thew New York case is expected by July, in the midst of the 2020 presidential election. The nation\u2019s gun laws have become one of the key issues in the Democratic race amidst an uptick in mass-shooting deaths and youth-led activism, though substantive new legislation is seen as all-but-impossible for the foreseeable future under divided government (Para. 5). One wrinkle during arguments came from a difference in opinion between Clement and Jeffrey Wall, the Justice Department\u2019s principal deputy solicitor general, who was arguing in favor of the gun owners (Para. 22).\nWall said it was a \u201cclose call\u201d and a \u201chard question\u201d but stopped short of endorsing the argument. Instead, Wall emphasized that the gun owners could still seek monetary damages (Para. 25). All in all, the justices spent just a few minutes probing the key constitutional question that gun-control activists feared would be on the table and that gun-rights groups hoped the court would address. Since the court\u2019s landmark 2008 opinion in D.C. v. Heller, the lower courts have generally weighed the public interest in gun laws as part of their consideration of whether they are legal. Using that methodology, appeals courts have upheld a broad range of gun restrictions, and those laws have remained on the books as the Supreme Court refused to review them (Para. 27). *\nReferences Higgins, T.
