The government will also have to approve all the related legislation and the EU Parliament will have to ratify the deal.  This is important, because the question is not just Parliamentary approval, it is will they leave. Given the tight deadline and (seemingly) large number of opportunities to attach amendments and riders, I see a 1/5 chance at best. Splitting the difference with my latest forecast (15%) since I still think the timetable is too tight.  My bet is that the EU holds off in an effort to force the U.K. to act, but the UK doesn\u2019t fold and requests a technical extension to better understand the economic impacts of leaving.

From the abstract: \"Of the six Bills linked to EC/EU Treaties, Parliament spent most time on the Maastricht Treaty (41 days), closely followed by the original membership process (39 days). Lisbon came third with 25 days. Lisbon gave rise to the largest number of divisions, although a number of these were not on the Bill itself but concerned government policy in various policy areas relevant to the Lisbon Treaty\". Below, the time each bill took on the floor: Treaty of Rome: 39 days\nSingle European Act: 12 days\nTreaty on European Union (Maastricht): 41 days\nTreaty of Amsterdam: 16 days\nTreaty of Nice: 11 days\nTreaty of Lisbon: 25 days That is an average time of 24 days, from HC 1R (formal) to Royal Assent. The government would have to beat the Treaty of Nice's time to get this over the line and finish the saga. Let's not forget that once Royal Assent has been granted, the game does not end there, the ball is knocked over to the EU.  Lastly, I am straining to see how Boris Johnson avoids sending the letter to the EU.

However, as the article points out, Merkel, the bell-weather of the EU leadership, has what I think is a realistic assessment: an extension must be granted if requested.  I think though the odds of Brexit happening this month have dramatically increased. The Parliamentary math (https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/mps/current-state-of-the-parties/) is not unfavourable, as this Bloomberg analysis shows: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-18/can-johnson-pull-off-the-impossible-we-re-counting-the-votes?srnd=politics-vp. Given the imprecision in the math, it is hard to have a narrow assessment. Boris Johnson needs 61 of 85 available MPs. Can he get them? I am assuming the DUP (10MPs) aligns in toto against the deal because it represents a betrayal of the coalition. This may be compensated for by the Labour MPs who will side with him -around 9, but let's say 10 for good measure, though Bloomberg says 31 are up for grabs (https://news.yahoo.com/brexit-rebel-labour-mps-defy-171030559.html). Let's be generous and say he gets the \u2018Gaukeward Squad\u2019: 19 MPs, The Spartans: 28 MPs, Independents: 5 MPs, Liberal Democrat Norman Lamb and Boris Johnson's brother, Jo. So, of those available 85, I see a route to 54, with Labour MPs (I think 10 or more) potentially tipping him over. There is a route to victory, which relies on Labour MPs and not bleeding Tory votes. CNN's analysis suggests Boris Johnson has a slight edge in the race. Overall, I am optimistic about Boris Johnson's chances of success. So why am I not completely sold on Brexit by Oct. 31? Firstly, the Letwin amendment (https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-parliaments-50098128) is designed to prevent a scenario where Brexit is achieved without a deal being finalized legislatively. As I said in the beginning, I cannot imagine that such a momentous step can or should be rushed through in under a fortnight. Given Letwin, there may not even be a vote this Saturday. So the vote tomorrow could essentially be meaningless if the Letwin amendment passes. My \"35%\" yes is purely instinctive. It feels like the right number, or maybe the wrong number in the right range.

Generous, since a probability-weighting would only yield 8)\n- Labour: 6 (25% of the opportunity since I think they want to win a reelection, but some support Brexit and may want to get it done)\n- Independents/others: 4 (just north of 50%) The math above sums to 41 (20 short) and in my view is a conservative accounting. However, if Johnson carried all the DUP MPs and they brought along all of the conservative \u201cSpartans\u201d he\u2019d have enough.

After making Queen Elizabeth quite literally hoof it over to the Houses of Parliament and read out his plans for the forthcoming legislative session, Boris Johnson needs to get back to the real task in hand -- getting a Brexit deal. Such a pivot would not ordinarily be required on the day of a Queen's Speech. Normally, the event heralds the start of a parliamentary term, setting forth a year's worth of important legislation that will shape the future of the country. But Johnson leads a minority government that's at least 40 shorts vote of winning anything in Parliament, and soon enough there will need to be an election to break the logjam. The point of Johnson's Queen's Speech wasn't to kick off a program of governing, but to tease Brexit-weary voters and show them what life might be like after Brexit, if only the Prime Minister had a majority to get on with it. The expensive jamboree otherwise known as the State Opening of Parliament might have looked important, but in reality, it was little more than a campaign ad with a fancy crown and a lot of diamonds (Para. 1-5). ** McGee, L.

Since there are the pamplets that still seem kind of weird to me, but I could be wrong, but using the previous two sources, would seem like that is not noise, but it seems like the political intentions at the least are suspicious  [3]. I read a source earlier that went through and explained the three major roadblocks that are needed to pass through the EU, which the likes of which are free trade, human rights stuff, and environmental regulations [4]. Which, might be hard to stuff down the throat of parliament right now, especially with the DUP not accepting concessions. Which would put the probability down much lower.  \"The British prime minister has a working majority of minus 45 in the Commons and would therefore require dozens of opposition MPs \u2014 as well as all his Conservatives \u2014 to vote for his deal in order for it to pass.

Which would put the total around 260 something votes for Teresa May, There are 288 members of the conservative party [5]. Yeah, it is not looking good for BJ. As of today, BJ has only passed one bill through Parliament out of eight. Making the base rate for that to be 12.5 Percent [6]. The Political capitol that Labour could get from a delay would be quite sizely (it is a word). Where they could call a Second Referendum. But to do that they need 2/3 of the MP's to vote for it.  Which is a good sign for how things are going for Labour in Brexit [7].  So when reading through the last article,  BJ accoriding to Jacob Rees-Mogg has 322 votes, however that includes the DUP [8].

The first avenue is itself blocked: the opposition and those MPs willing to align themselves with the opposition, cannot coalesce behind any leader: Corbyn is unacceptable and will not stand down, and the SNP & LibDems are too small, and there is a question about having the SNP lead the government of the United Kingdom when its goal is to leave it. Legally, a vote of no confidence would not immediately result in a general election and so the only way to force a rapid change of government would be to vote on an early day motion (EDM), which would be a vote of confidence in a specific individual, and so we get back to the leadership question the opposition has. The Benn Act, then, to my mind, is the last stand against No Deal. I have looked at John Major's notion that the government could get round the Benn Act through an order in council, but i think the whole business unlikely and even the government has dismissed the idea -which could be through sand in our eyes, but to what end? There are a few loopholes in the Benn Act: if parliament agrees to a deal, then the government is absolved of its responsibility to send a letter requesting an extension. The other loophole is that the Prime Minister must accept an extension according to the parameters detailed in his letter, which requests an extension till January 31 2020. In other words, if the European Council proposed an extension outside of this date, the Prime Minister need not accept the extension. More on this here: https://ukconstitutionallaw.org/2019/09/13/oliver-garner-the-benn-burt-extension-act-a-roadblock-to-a-no-deal-brexit/. There is the possibility of some nation, like Hungary, vetoing an extension request, but judging by Juncker and Varadkar's statements, this is extremely unlikely considering the nations most affected by Brexit -France, Germany, etc- have little incentive to veto an extension, this would imply a country like Hungary acting against the interests of France and Germany... The government could simply throw its toys out of the pram and veto key decisions and make itself such a nuisance the EU vetoes an extension request, but with only a week left, that would be quite a tantrum. Finally, civil servants are obliged to follow the law and if they perceive the government to be breaking the law, they may simply not co-operate in enforcing its will. All this rambling leads me to think that the Prime Minister is attempting to drive a bus through the eye of a needle. There is a gulf between rhetoric and reality and I keep asking myself: if Boris Johnson could get round the Benn Act, why has he not announced how he will do it? In 2019, leaks are inevitable, and yet, nothing... Boris Johnson cannot remain Prime Minister, uphold the law and exit on 31 Oct. 2019.

I vividly recall the bloodstained images of the attack on civil rights marchers by police in 1968 that set off this terrible explosion of violence. It was a war that not only killed more than 3,700, it injured an estimated 47,000 people in at least 37,000 shootings and over 16,000 bombings.

Parliament will meet on Saturday and vote on any deal achieved by Mr Johnson at a Brussels summit this week. Labour said it would \"wait and see\" but would oppose anything \"damaging\". The European Commission echoed the prime minister, saying: \"A lot of work remains to be done.\" Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: \"We don't think the Tories have moved too far on their deal.\" SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon told the same programme: \"We will not vote for the kind of deal specified by Boris Johnson.\" Talks in Brussels between UK and EU officials - described as \"intense technical discussions\" - continued on Sunday and will re-start on Monday (Para. 1-8).\n**\nBBC News Website.

Courts ruled that the Benn Act requires that the UK request an extension should a deal not be accepted, but this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the UK won\u2019t leave on 10/31. \nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-49936352 So short of an EU rejection of the extension, how is this possible? This link helped out a bit: https://www.google.com/amp/s/finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/latest-dutch-govt-wants-more-113036126.html\nMy understanding is the courts said Johnson can\u2019t be compelled with a court order to do something he is already required by law (Benn\u2019s Bill) to do. Meanwhile, Johnson says he will follow the law, but will leave on 10/31 no matter what. To do this, he would either need to find a loophole in the bill (I have yet to hear a reasonable scenario, so low probability) or the EU accepts his deal (even lower probability based on public statements).  One interesting thing to note though is that the rhetoric on the EU side is getting stronger. With negotiators and EU members saying that the UK proposal needs to improve seriously before they will grant an extension.

(Para. 1). There is one group, led by Germany, whose priority is to avoid a no-deal Brexit in order to minimize disruption to industrial supply chains. Another group, led by France, seeks to stop the UK from exploiting the opportunities for regulatory arbitrage. The French fear that a Singapore on Thames might undercut EU standards on social policy and the environment. Then there is a third group that wants the UK to reverse Brexit altogether, as a symbol of the fightback against the rising global tide of populism. What all three have in common is a lack of interest in agreeing to engage with UK prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s proposals for the withdrawal deal. They are reassured that the Brexit extension bill passed by the House of Commons has removed the threat of an immediate no-deal Brexit. Legal documents submitted to a Scottish court state that Mr Johnson intends to comply with the requirements of the Benn Act and seek a Brexit delay if he cannot secure a deal. But even if the deadline is extended once more, the EU should think twice before rejecting the latest UK plan. It is trivially true that an extension buys time, avoids disruption on the day, and maybe even opens up a theoretical path towards a Brexit reversal. But rejection would still be a short-sighted strategy. If the process is allowed to stray past the current October 31 deadline, the EU will have to live with the consequences of rejecting the deal (Para. 1-4). **\nReference\n**\nM\u00fcnchau, W. (2019).

Where the Ireland/NI border was only created less than 100 years ago and splits what for many hundreds of years was a single country, and is criss crossed by hundred of roads, lanes and land holdings, the England Scotland border is a historical national border between different legal systems and crossed by far fewer roads and land holdings.

Johnson said his government was seeking a more decisive split from the European Union (Para. 5). \u201cIn these circumstances, the proposed \u2018backstop\u2019 is a bridge to nowhere, and a new way forward must be found,\u201d he wrote (Para. 5-6).\nThe E.U. has in the past resisted such checks on the grounds that they could jeopardize the delicate peace established by the 1998 Good Friday agreement (Para. 8). [Within only one month, Boris Johnson lost control \u2014 and a historic Supreme Court battle] The proposals were not immediately rejected in Brussels or other European capitals, as has at times been the case following British negotiation gambits. Several analysts, though, said the prospect of a breakthrough didn\u2019t look good. Johnson\u2019s plan appears to cross red lines drawn years ago by European negotiators. Juncker cited \u201cpositive advances,\u201d especially the proposal to keep many Northern Ireland regulations aligned with E.U. standards. But he said that there were \u201cproblematic points\u201d related to Britain\u2019s apparent unwillingness to commit to keeping the border fully and permanently open (Para. 8-11). ***__\nReferences * Adam, K., Birnbaum, M. & Booth, W.

Since he doesn't have the support of parliament he will try and leave the EU through other means such as letting the October 31st extension expire. If he thinks that parliament, the EU, or the UK supreme court won't let this happen then he will call a general election which would necessitate an extension agreement. He should be aware that he will probably not win a general election which increases the chance that he will not agree to a Brexit extension and therefore have Britain leave the EU at the end of this month.* However this option would carry huge legal ramifications since parliament voted to make hard Brexit illegal. Still, Boris would be known as the prime minister who finally hammered through Brexit and for that would solidify a Trump-like voter base which would certainly help his survival chances in the Hard Brexit fallout. The 40% probability will be much higher than most people expect but reflects the desperation that Boris will be acting with to follow through on his Brexit promise. *He won't win a general election outright because: In the probable case of a general election there will be a hung parliament and the Brexit party will have garnered the most votes and can probably form a coalition with Boris' Conservatives. Maybe the Lib Dems and Labour can form an anti-Brexit coalition but that's very unlikely since Corbyn's Labour campaign will flip flop between being anti-Brexit and being pro-softBrexit, lacking a rallying cry.

All the PM has to do is stall a bit longer. Thus, no matter what the UK domestic courts say about the validity of the crash-out, the EU has no mechanism and probably no stomach for trying to undo an Article 50 exit to accommodate somebody's political and legal awkwardness, and the UK will be out as far as they are concerned.   Re-entry, if anyone wants it, would then have to undergo the full application process.  Frankly, if I were the EU (full disclosure--I'm not), I wouldn't be all that crazy about having them back in those circumstances. This is all pretty dreadful.  One would love to know how the situation would have differed if both sides had stuck to the truth during and after the referendum campaign, or even if the referendum question had been crafted by people who knew how to do such a thing.

The Government are clear that they will obey the law but also state they will leave deal or no deal. The recent Benn/Letwin bill would seem to mitigate against them being able to leave without a deal. Yet still the Government state they will leave deal or no deal. In a recent interview Dominic Rabb the foreign secretary stated that the benn/Letwin legislation would be legally tested to the limits. This suggests they think they have a legal route around this. There is also the fact that any request to extend would require unanimous support from EU countries. Will France carry out its threat to veto any extension and let the uk crash out, probably not. One possible route is that no deal emerges from the EU summit. On or around 17 October, Johnson resigns, meaning 14 days to find a new PM. However my understanding is that for the queen to appoint a successor, requires a recommendation from the PM. He could state that there is no successor, 14 days elapse and then there is a general election and we crash out. Also I cannot see how Corbyn could muster the votes to become PM. The Lib Dem\u2019s, Independent Group and most of the Independents would refuse to back him. The remainders know what they are against not what they are for and their fragile working together is unlikely to last long. Another route is that some deal does emerge from the Eu summit. A number of labour MPs are already moving towards accepting a deal any deal after previously voting against Theresa May\u2019s deals. 31 October has the feel of a real deadline and the pressure will be on to agree a deal.
