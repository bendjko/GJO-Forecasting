Its hard to find an unbiased poll commissioned by the papers on this issue (the Herald and The Scotsman appear to have a bias towards unionism and anti independence so their Savanta ComRes polling (and its fairly minuscule scope) should be taken with a pinch of salt I'd suggest) but their assessments can be blended with other, more qualitative factors to base a half decent probability estimate on (with a fairly objective degree of confidence).  So how do you build a probability forecast on anything beyond 50/50 (which is arguably as far as the split and not entirely unbiased polling gets you to for the \"majority\" question)?  Other factors I think are worth taking into consideration at this late stage: 1.  Debate performance appeared stable [3] and unlikely to move the needle in any fundamental way, but Sturgeon's firm and repeated declaration that a \"wild cat\" referendum was off the cards (and that an Indy Ref would only be called at a responsible time once economic stability was achieved) appeared to be a last minute appeal to the undecided or gently Indy AND non-Indy leaning voters that the SNP could be trusted as the responsible, balanced, \"centre ground\" vote (on the Indy issue anyway) that supported a democratic decision on the issue at \"the right and responsible time\". 2.  Sturgeon's calculation appears to be that this group is worth a punt at persuading and that their benefit trumps any possible loss of support from the hard line Indy vote (that they may feel will more likely vote Alba or Green at this point anyway or will not be likely to jump ship in large numbers, still seeing the SNP as their best chance for what they want despite the softened approach to Independence). Does this increase or decrease the chance of a majority?  Hard to say definitively (and even harder to say if the pitch will land), but the mollification of their Indy line is an interesting path to see them take that may be designed at the last second to spoke the Conservative messaging wheel and allay fears of more reasonable voters.  I think this gives a slight increase in probability of a majority and with some increased confidence given the amount of internal opinion polling that probably went into this messaging pitch. 3.  We should also factor in BJ's, Westminster's and the Tory Government's current popularity north of the border into this question (not good, but how much that drives any \"F*** You, Jimmy!\" voting contribution is also hard to determine with high confidence).  Whilst BJ's increasingly public corruption and amoral governance does not appear to have fundamentally altered voter intentions south of the border (a depressing measure of modern British ethical, moral and honour based leadership) that may not be true North of the Border with a stronger anti-Brexit crowd, and freshly Brexit scarred fishing industry and a generally stronger \"anti-Westminster\" (and \"anti-Tory fop\") sentiment at the best of times.  Again, a (slight) contribution to the rise above the 50/50 polling baseline I feel is warranted against this factor. I fell like the crowd has probably hit the correct mark on this probability estimate in the last few days (having been perhaps fairly over confident up until this last week or so) and I'm happy to go a little above based on my personal weighting of the factors described above.

The only movement in the polls in the last month seems to be a slight reduction in support for the SNP on the constitutioncy, and a large shift towards the greens on the all important list. Furthermore I am still confident that SNP supporters will turn out slightly less on the day. In part due to a lack of enthusiasm for an increasingly lackluster government (for many independence is the only motivation to still vote for them) but also due to the historical turn out trends amongst the demographics which the SNP gets most of its support. Going by the granularity of the polling it seems that the most motivated by the independence issue isn't young Independence supporters, it's old supporters of the Union. Therefore the increased talk of another ref may have a greater positive impact on those voting for unionist parties than it does amongst much of the SNP vote base. Turnout for Holyrood elections is typically quite low at around 55% (compared to 65-70% amongst the Scottish electorate for Westminster elections). I suspect we will see a turnout comparable to a UK wide election next week due to the increased media attention over its labeling as a precursor to indeyref 2, and the huge increase in postal ballots. On this last point I am unsure if and how this could effect the result. Will postal votes be spread equally, or will they increase the turnout for any particular side? For this uncertainty I have not reduced the likelihood below my previous prediction. I am new to forecasting, but feel the communities rating on this question is too high. Going beyond bookies odds and indeed much recent polling.

That said, Cummings appears to be enjoying the limelight again and I can't believe what he's been stirring in the last 48 hours is the best he has on the Clown Prince.  A few more suitably egregious demonstrations of corruption and self interest (although how many more are needed is in itself a telling indicator of lethargic British morality!) and Scots may vote for the SNP just to stick it to the grubby, corrupt little \"denizen at No 10\". It is entirely plausible to believe that Scots will vote for the SNP in May just to stick it to BoJo, London and England in general only to then vote against independence if and when a vote comes up and \"things get real\".  I think looking at Independence vote appetite as an indicator of May voting intentions may miss a few nuances and shades of grey in voting behaviour for a disgruntled, animated and generally mistrustful electorate.

Something that has intrigued me about this election is why the SNP seems to be riding so high in many polls when I try to look objectively at the party's record over 14 years in office, either as a majority or in the minority with support of Greens and Lib Dems (in some cases)?

See https://bit.ly/3dL3MZZ  A Scots business group is also on the bandwagon urging voters to vote against independence on the basis that the economy, pensions and jobs are more secure in the union. See https://bit.ly/3fUeoZo. As @Juliabizz mentioned some days ago, the economic viability of independence may be something that voters will have to \nconfront. An IPSOS MORI poll published yesterday, https://bit.ly/2Q4pvEe, shows that the topic of independence is not a clear cut one and the votes are well likely to be well within the limits of any statistical error. This poll also shows that Alba will only get 3% of the vote which seems to be a different result to the one mentioned above. In one respect, Alba's result is likely to be fairly limited seeing it is a) new, b) a simple one cause party, c) Salmond's reputation may be tarnished by recent events and d) is still yet to be proven 'in the trenches'. Broadly speaking, the 'trust gauge' in the SNP is down since November in this survey and hence, IMO, shows that voters are reassessing their faith in the SNp after the recent Salmond affair ructions. Scottish Labour, on the other hand, under the leadership of the new leader, has shown a substantial increase in trust amongst voters. That could quite easily steal some votes from the SNP. This quote from the IPSOS MORI poll; \"All polls are subject to a wide range of potential sources of error.

Particularly in the light of some defections to Salmond's new Alba Party.And while the recent crisis around sexual harassment is a sensitive topic, I wonder if this statement about changing the 'not proven' law in Scotland is perhaps her attempt to redeem her reputation amongst voters that are reconsidering supporting her because of the atrocious handling of the Salmond affair? See https://bbc.in/3sW9uyK. I am sure Labour's stand to clean up Holyrood will appeal to many voters that have been disappointed in the SNP's last 18 -30 months in office; https://bbc.in/2Ps6zzj And the Tories claim to be intent on improving education and apprenticeships (see previous reference) and protecting the environment may appeal to many disavowed ex SNP voters; see https://bbc.in/3dzr7h7.

They're appealing to people that have been affected directly and indirectly by drug addition and drug related deaths; https://bbc.in/3mk1FQE. So, all the opposition are targeting voters on topics that are widely considered in need of attention in Scotland. This, approach does, however, take the risk of trying to be too many things to too many people in some cases. But after 14 years of SNP 'rule' there are likely to be many disenchanted voters after the recent SNP high profile bungling.  Somewhat surprisingly, Sturgeon seems to be relatively quiet on the topic of independence. Perhaps she's hoping Salmond will do the work on that one for her? Or perhaps she has seen this article about the apparently declining importance of independence?  that is making the SNP look like a one cause party? Which it has historically focussed on both in Salmond's time and Sturgeon's time at the helm; https://bbc.in/2PBBTeT. Prof John Curtice, a widely respected political scientist who has been fairly accurate in previous UK election predictions, does suggest that the SNP's chances of a 2014 style majority are 50:50. See the last paragraph of the last reference. And also https://bit.ly/39Kaheq And reiterated in this article; https://bit.ly/39GqAbZ, which raises the suggestion that Alba could do more harm than good for the SNP. And Alba is certainly a one cause party; https://yhoo.it/3mnw54s All of this begs the big question, the elephant in the room, will Johnson grant another independence referendum in the event SNP do win a majority? He and his cabinet have quietly made it known they do not favour a second referendum. Hence, some borderline independence voters may abandon SNP and Alba and focus on rebuilding Scotland with the aid of English taxpayers funds. All in all, although the election is only 4 weeks away, I am inclined to follow @Juliabizz  who rightly, IMO, points out that independence runs into the issue of economic reality. Thus, there is a chance some voters are now focussing on that as well as rebuilding with English taxpayers funds? @SE_Meyer you may find some of this interesting.\n"], [89038, "2021-04-05T16:52:03Z", [0.75], ""], [529, "2021-04-05T01:46:48Z", [0.64], "Raising forecast for now in part on SNP's apparent increase between last month's and this month's Sunday Times poll https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2021_Scottish_Parliament_election https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-04/scottish-nationalists-seen-winning-supermajority-poll-shows"], [94872, "2021-04-05T00:42:02Z", [0.68], ""], [85097, "2021-04-04T23:35:48Z", [0.5], "https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/nationalists-on-course-to-win-supermajority-g05l8c0st\nCurtice forecasts 65 seats (a majority of just 1) for the SNP based on a recent poll which includes the two new opposing political parties set up by current Russia Today employees."], [64041, "2021-04-04T21:00:01Z", [0.85], ""], [1333, "2021-04-04T14:04:41Z", [1.0], ""], [13432, "2021-04-04T10:39:35Z", [0.85], ""], [95503, "2021-04-03T22:55:20Z", [0.75], ""], [691, "2021-04-03T18:23:38Z", [0.92], ""], [85144, "2021-04-03T15:50:40Z", [0.72], ""], [34959, "2021-04-03T13:52:25Z", [0.72], ""], [98351, "2021-04-02T17:23:12Z", [0.8], ""], [58028, "2021-04-02T13:05:27Z", [0.85], ""], [1333, "2021-04-02T09:16:16Z", [1.0], ""], [94872, "2021-04-02T02:51:45Z", [0.58], ""], [1624, "2021-04-02T00:54:29Z", [0.8], ""], [95503, "2021-04-01T23:44:08Z", [0.77], ""], [55987, "2021-04-01T15:44:29Z", [0.92], ""], [95503, "2021-04-01T11:32:11Z", [0.73], ""], [96450, "2021-04-01T09:34:20Z", [0.8], ""], [99993, "2021-03-31T23:05:03Z", [0.4], ""], [100184, "2021-03-31T18:59:02Z", [0.88], ""], [99176, "2021-03-31T15:03:15Z", [0.9], ""], [85097, "2021-03-31T13:07:54Z", [0.43], "Some analyses of the regional seats suggest Alba could only deny at most a couple or so seats from the SNP, so they will not be the most decisive factor in this question, instead it will be the SNP's own popularity and that of independence, so I revert more towards my pre-Alba forecast.

SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has promised to push for another referendum if they win a majority.  The Scottish parliamentary system through its so-called \"Additional Member System\" creates a much closer and more direct relationship to public opinion in proportionally allocating seats than the Westminster system of \"first past the post.\"[2]  In this way, it seems to me, that many Scottish voters see a direct connection between voting SNP and rejecting the UK government's chaos and bungling of Brexit and COVID under Boris Johnson.  The AMS method makes public opinion a much more reliable gauge of the outcome than in \"first past the post\" systems, in my view.  It is hard to imagine a scenario where the UK government is able to implement Brexit in a way that mollifies public opinion now that the negative implications of Brexit for everyday life are becoming more clear with each day.  A small, mundane example: UK visitors to EU will pay a non-EU interchange fee that is five times the amount they paid on purchases in EU territories before Brexit.[3]  The media has extensively covered the much larger issues with food, medicine, transportation, and security.  COVID and the Johnson government's perceived callousness will still be a fresh wound for all in the UK in May, but especially for Scottish nationalism.
