The Dutch company ASML dominates the market for the advanced machines needed by Chinese companies to make high-end chips needed for devices such as smartphones.\nBut ASML has been unable since 2019 to obtain a licence from the Dutch government to export its extreme ultraviolet lithography equipment to China\u2019s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, the country\u2019s biggest chipmaker, according to people familiar with the matter. Biden on Thursday banned Americans from investing in 59 Chinese companies that included SMIC.\nThe Netherlands has not disclosed the reason for the licence freeze, but people familiar with the matter say the Trump administration successfully lobbied the Dutch government because of concerns about the potential for EUV technology to help the Chinese military develop advanced weapons.

Developing countries are defined in accordance with the list maintained by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).\" Being in a legal grey area, the dual-use character of chips produced on ASML machinery could turn \"military\" if there is credible information that Chinese companies ordering ASML product are contracted by the Chinese government and could effectively design specific semiconductors, CPUs, structures for the assembly and use of ICBM or other strategic weapons threatening the whole Asia Pacific region and beyond. The fast pace at which the Chinese PLA has been modernized in recent years alongside economic growth will not ease worries. In this case, the criteria (ii), (iv), (v), (vii) clearly speak against granting such an export license, whereas China - despite still having the official status of a \"developing economy\" according to their per capita income, criteria (viii) - very certainly has the technical capabilities of such an abuse of the \"civil technology\" for \"military use\".
