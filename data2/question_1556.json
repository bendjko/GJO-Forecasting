After a tumultuous first half to the year, with both demand and supply side shocks that created incredibly high levels of market volatility, in the past month the oil price has steadied. Part of the volatility this spring was created by unexpected lower demand as lockdowns were rolled out around the globe. Air travel was at 4% of usual levels in the US. That represents an unprecedented low for an industry that uses a large amount of oil based fuel. Most importantly, the reduction in oil demand was so rapid that there was a major glut of oil in the market. At one point, there was so much oil in Cushing, OK that the front month oil futures went negative. Furthermore, Russia and OPEC were struggling to negotiation any sort of supply reduction. This also sent the price down precipitously earlier in the year. There is no expected OPEC news in the coming three weeks, which simplifies this question.  As the US recovers, the price of WTI has ticked up slowly and steadied. The price of oil will likely fall if shutdowns and lockdowns return to the US. With several weeks of extremely high infection totals, it seems likely that the market has priced in the mass infection we are currently experience, and will continue to experience for, at minimum, several weeks. If lockdowns return before Aug 14th, I will have to update my prediction accordingly. Oil companies have projected oil prices in the high 40\u2019s to mid 50\u2019s by 2021, with a gradual linear increase until then. Of course, these projections must be taken with a grain of salt as higher oil prices benefit petroleum firms. \"Shell now expects a barrel to cost $40 in 2021 and $50 in 2022, down from the $60 it assumed in its most recent annual report. BP forecasts that Brent will average $55 from 2021 until 2050. Just a few months ago its central assumption for prices over the next 20 years was $70.\u201d (Economist) We can approximate the distribution of oil prices by using oil options traded on the NYMEX. The $40 straddle on the Aug future is trading at ~$4. From these options, implied volatility in oil futures is 37.12% annually. There are 15 trading days before the 13th of August. Implied volatility for this time period could be calculated as  Vol = 37.12% / sqrt(252/15)\n=9.1% So we can expect that the distribution of oil prices is going to be normal with a mean of $40.83 and a std of 9.1% or 3.7.

My forecast is low for oil going back above $45 because, despite rig shut-ins and decreased OPEC production, that's back to normal for the past year, and I can't imagine prices back to normal by August. We know that a month ago when prices went negative storage capacity maxed out. I don't know if there's a data source, but seems a good bet oil in storage is still much higher than usual, meaning supply will probably still be on the high side. (Technically, it means less demand for delivery in the futures market. ) A rise of $12 in 2 months is a lot, so I give it a 2% chance.  But let's say by mid-June the price rises to $42. I'm going to not only raise my forecast for the higher range but I will--and this is the seems like cheating part--overshoot my forecast for that range to make up for the days I was forecasting that range at 2%. So if the price rises to $42 and I think there's a 25% chance it will land on $46, I will forecast, in mid-June, a 50% chance not a 25%, so the average of my forecast will more or less reflect I had been forecasting 25% since mid-May.

At a twelve-month horizon they may marginally outperform a random walk, but this result is sensitive to the sample period and data frequency chosen. On the other hand, Chernenko, Schwarz and Wright (2004) conclude that the oil futures price predicts spot prices correctly on average; Wu and McCallum (2005) agree, but observe that the forecasting errors are large. Reichsfeld and Roache (2011) find that the oil futures price outperforms a random walk at the three-month horizon but is no better at longer horizons. Overall, then, the results from the literature are mixed. But they do not strongly suggest that the futures curve is a much better predictor of spot prices than a random walk.\" This model [4] seems promising, but it's way over my head.

So, with due deference and timidity, a simple model: - WTI price a function of a) economic activity in world economy and b) restrictions on supply, either via deliberate supplier restriction (eg OPEC), or external disruptions to supply (another from conflict to eg banks withdrawing credit for their own reasons or because projects aren\u2019t viable at \u2018new normal\u2019 prices - on the first part of the \u2018equation\u2019, three scenarios a) a bit better cos unlocking restores economic activity but there\u2019s still a lot of damage and disruption already done to account for, b) quite a lot worse, unlocking doesn\u2019t do much and second order effects (international economy, supply chain disruption etc) continue to compound or c) some mixture of the two that balances out to an bit worse\u2019 - on the second, OPEC plus seem to be trying to restrict supply with initial moves reported for several countries. Scenarios a) it works a bit but is minor relative to the demand shock or b) it doesn\u2019t work at all (they couldn\u2019t make it work in better times and need for state and firm revenue now more acute so incentives to defect high.

This will support the spot market price, while non-industrial interest grows by hedge funds,financial institution and not least governments and sovereign wealth funds, who may consider WTI  with its high quality chemical profile as a good investment alternative. Even developing countries such as India may start to stockpile huge amounts of crude oil and make up for the recent demand gap in order to be prepared for their future economic growth. Locations for stockpiling crude oil for physical delivery will have to be build or expanded very quickly to make that possible. Even companies such as the airline industry and transport may use the current low prices to hedge their exposure to future crude oil price raises on the futures market. After several rounds of overshooting in prices for the bottom and overshooting for the top, price for WTI may find a new equilibrium trend with a slight upward momentum at around 42 USD in early summer, when travel uses to spur consumption, if this price level is feasible and sustainable in the medium and long term for supply as well as demand.\nThe largest uncertainty however comes from a (very unlikely) event of an escalating price war between Saudi Arabia (plus OPEC) and Russia, which in case damages every single party in the business and is therefore almost neglegible.

Feels like the co-operation between the different producers is unlikely to come to much. The one thing that could give some upside pressure is some sort of regulatory or other intervention.  I am going to say - 66% chance Economy has not really picked up/lockdown still extensive etc. and large supply overhang, in which case the distribution is 70/30 less than $25 or $25 to $35. I would be 100% less than $25 but I think there is a very real chance that Trump tries to intervene. 34% chance we are getting back to normal from an economic perspective, in which case, given the supply overhang, perhaps we are 10% less than but close to $25, 85% between $25 - 35 and 5% between 35 and 45 which would probably require both the economy being back and Russia and OPEC being more disciplined than they are on supply.

In the United States at least, application of the White House's Opening Up America Again guidelines gets the Country into Phase 3 in the middle of the summer at the earliest with sometime in the fall being more likely.  It could be later if local re-openings go poorly and hot spots develop.  Even Phase 3 retains some restrictions that will hinder commerce.  The recovery is more likely to be prolonged with an asymptotic leveling out. Oil stocks are largely full with oil mostly acquired at ~$55 PPB.  The lowest cost oil producers worldwide can make money substantially below that value.  If worldwide consumption comes down by 50%, the lowest costs producers can fill demand and make money above ~$23 PPB.  This rises to ~$32 PPB at 25% reduction in consumption.  We may only asymptotically approach $55 PPB again."], [87869, "2020-04-23T03:31:36Z", [0.75, 0.23, 0.01, 0.01, 0.0], "Current June contract at $14.23.

I don't understand the narrowing spreads:  It could be that Russia / Saudi Arabia are preferentially discounting vs Brent. Or it could be that to cover rising shipping rates (due to contango storage) that brent has to be priced cheaper to be competitive in the US. But the idea that 10 mbd will be taken off the markets is Poppeycock. Saudi Arabia has the ability- perhaps to take maybe 5 off the market.  But for technical reasons having to do with freezing, ost of russia's wells cannot reduce significantly.   Maybe 1-2 mb/d.    Still leaves the world over supplied by 2-3 mb/d with 100 mb sitting in tanker storage, and most landbound storage filled.  No date for meeting set on website.  So they wll try to get maximum mileage out of talkie/talkie.  Expect those meeting to go for 2-3 weeks.   In the end the results will underwhelm as the physical constraints are considerable. I do expect that DUC conversion will cease in the US, that drilling will fall off a precipice as each drill rig completes its existing contract., and in many cases are cancelled.   US oil production will decay naturally from fracking's natural rapid decay.  Longterm, fracking still serves an incredibly valuable role for the US and the World.  The Russian budget is predicated on $55/barrel.  The Saudi's $80/barrel.   US fracking companies (some) can be profitable  c$38.  US fracing will force a recalculation for both the Sauds and Russia. TLDR:  The world is still oversupplied.  Demand destruction is not going away in the next 30 days.  Us rig count will drop another 20-40.  And a lot of older stripper wells will start the process of being shutin.

Originating in China, it spread faster than flu, and more deadly. To combat it, Chinese authority imposed quarantines, and other social distancing measures. It worked, but the engines of industry ground down and the Chinese economy needed less and less oil. This led to a surplus of 2+ million barrels per day. Fast forward to March, a worldwide pandemic is underway and economies are slowing down rapidly. IHS Markit believes CoVid-19 will cause 3.8 million barrels spare capacity to hit the markets. OPEC + has suffered a possible fatal blow, Russia no longer wants to go along with cuts recommend by OPEC led by Saudi Arabia. So the Saudis have ramped up production to 12 million to flood the market and teach Russia a lesson about unity. That now puts 5.8 million surplus barrels into the worlds supply. That is why oil has fallen from $50s down to $27 before it stabilized at $33 at the time of this writing. In a nutshell, this is a show of spite in game theory. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spite_(game_theory)\nSaudi and Russia did not agree upon some master strategy to destroy American shale production to regain market share, cripple the global economy for world domination, or part of some scheme by the Illuminati to take control of the UN. Rather it is just a punitive action against a reticent partner. It occurred after a failed negotiation that gives us a clue to the duration. Saudi has cash reserves to go 3 years at $33/bbl and make their budget, Russia for even longer. Sure, one could argue they could drain their reserves to teach the other a lesson, but that is not rational behavior by heads of state. Russia just wanted a better deal, the Saudis wanted fairness. They will likely hammer out a palatable comprise within weeks. Rumors have it that negotiations are still happening. On the other hand, China has shown signs that it\u2019s epidemic has burned out. We expected a normal epidemic curve of 2-3 months up, and 2-3 months down, but if we are to trust Chinese numbers, they suppressed the epidemic curve to just 3 months. There is now an immediate push to jump up the economy, within weeks or months they should be consuming more oil, hopefully taking 1-2 million barrels off the market. That is good news, and better, inevitable. Almost nothing can stop the post-epidemic recovery, for any country. I took a survey of oilfield executives and asked the simple question of \u201cHow many months will oil stay below $40/bbl?\u201d Answers: 2,2,3,5,6,6,9,9,12 Mean: 6 StDev:3.4 68% range: 2.5 to 9.5 months.

When Secretary Pompeo was in Eastern Europe earlier in the year and offered to sell them as much oil and gas at a market rate, this probably sparked Russian unease and drove the Russians to seek to push the US out of the fossil fuel energy production. 3) US oil producers have their entire 2020 production hedged out through the year end into the start of 2021. Therefore, any desire to put pressure on these producers by the Saudis and the Russians and OPEC+ means that they have to keep the price low or drive it lower throughout the year. Hence, my confidence in a very low oil forecast. This forecast is also very low because when markets collapse like this they can stay quite low for longer periods than most people expect and they tend to build a base before prices go up again. 4) There exists the outside possibility but worth noting because of its strategic importance that US oil producers are cooperating with the Russians and the Saudis based on their mutual desire to push oil prices so low that it upends the world movement to renewable energy and puts the electric car industry out of business. It could simply be their overarching objective through the year 2021 that they all will lower oil prices to the floor and keep their consumers using oil in all things and forget about carbon taxes, renewable energy, and non-internal combustion engine powered vehicles.
