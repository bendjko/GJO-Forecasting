Still seems most likely to be ~6.5%. https://www.reuters.com/world/china/view-4-chinas-q1-gdp-grows-record-pace-recovery-speeds-up-2021-04-16/#:~:text=%22We%20expect%20GDP%20will%20slow,%2C%20coming%20in%20at%208.6%25"], [29680, "2021-05-26T00:55:18Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4], ""], [78366, "2021-05-25T21:42:22Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [85144, "2021-05-25T19:49:40Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.22, 0.48, 0.29], ""], [96392, "2021-05-25T18:57:40Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.37, 0.41, 0.22], ""], [1333, "2021-05-25T18:07:47Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.28, 0.44, 0.18], ""], [1333, "2021-05-25T14:36:56Z", [0.0, 0.18, 0.2, 0.44, 0.18], ""], [754, "2021-05-25T13:04:08Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.33, 0.51, 0.16], ""], [97539, "2021-05-25T11:24:20Z", [0.11, 0.47, 0.23, 0.13, 0.06], ""], [101113, "2021-05-25T09:23:10Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.7, 0.0], ""], [95503, "2021-05-25T09:17:26Z", [0.01, 0.08, 0.33, 0.39, 0.19], ""], [27661, "2021-05-25T07:40:47Z", [0.0, 0.02, 0.19, 0.51, 0.28], ""], [27661, "2021-05-25T07:40:04Z", [0.0, 0.02, 0.32, 0.51, 0.15], ""], [86554, "2021-05-24T13:15:40Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.22, 0.77], ""], [1333, "2021-05-24T11:57:17Z", [0.0, 0.18, 0.2, 0.38, 0.24], ""], [88098, "2021-05-24T10:32:52Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.04, 0.19, 0.77], ""], [1333, "2021-05-23T16:21:06Z", [0.01, 0.18, 0.2, 0.32, 0.29], ""], [88452, "2021-05-22T17:52:02Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.41, 0.59], ""], [36132, "2021-05-21T20:41:58Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.11, 0.15, 0.73], "Update -  \"We expect GDP will slow to 6.1% y/y in Q2-21, and average 5.5% y/y in the remainder of 2021, below the official growth target of 6.0%.

Also, growth between Q2 2020 and Q3 2020 and between Q3 2020 and Q4 2020 was at 3,1% and 3,2 almost double the pre Covid average  (2). This shows a lot of rebound growth happened in 2020 already. Higher growth in Q2 2020 also means a stronger baseline to compare Q2021 with.  Growth figures for April 2021 show a slowdown in year on year growth but still point to a large expansion.

But the variable of, \"the world coming out of the COVID-19\" should contribute positively to above average growth for at least 2-quarters. - See 2010 and 2011 quarterly gdp yoy growth rates - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_GDP_of_China#Quarterly_GDP"], [13306, "2021-05-05T10:18:23Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.12, 0.6, 0.28], ""], [86367, "2021-05-05T05:18:28Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.32, 0.68], ""], [1333, "2021-05-04T14:52:27Z", [0.1, 0.11, 0.22, 0.27, 0.3], ""], [1646, "2021-05-03T21:12:36Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.2, 0.61, 0.18], ""], [100863, "2021-05-03T21:11:44Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [27661, "2021-05-03T16:03:17Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.28, 0.47, 0.24], ""], [28899, "2021-05-03T13:58:15Z", [0.0, 0.02, 0.1, 0.44, 0.44], ""], [34959, "2021-05-03T04:38:04Z", [0.0, 0.02, 0.3, 0.48, 0.2], ""], [31275, "2021-05-03T01:29:41Z", [0.0, 0.03, 0.15, 0.39, 0.43], ""], [1333, "2021-05-02T15:00:34Z", [0.11, 0.11, 0.22, 0.27, 0.29], ""], [95503, "2021-05-02T12:35:18Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.45, 0.35, 0.1], ""], [95503, "2021-05-02T12:34:06Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.4, 0.4, 0.15], ""], [95503, "2021-05-02T12:28:37Z", [0.0, 0.02, 0.37, 0.43, 0.18], ""], [24027, "2021-05-02T04:40:42Z", [0.01, 0.01, 0.23, 0.51, 0.24], ""], [97569, "2021-05-01T13:16:54Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.55, 0.2], ""], [98241, "2021-04-30T23:31:18Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.75], ""], [87175, "2021-04-30T18:43:05Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.25, 0.45, 0.25], ""], [1333, "2021-04-30T13:41:35Z", [0.1, 0.1, 0.22, 0.27, 0.31], ""], [13306, "2021-04-30T07:09:25Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.65, 0.25], ""], [100828, "2021-04-29T15:45:48Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.73, 0.27], ""], [31275, "2021-04-29T00:09:20Z", [0.0, 0.03, 0.17, 0.37, 0.43], ""], [15196, "2021-04-28T21:12:21Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.7], ""], [1333, "2021-04-28T14:44:40Z", [0.1, 0.1, 0.24, 0.25, 0.31], ""], [87342, "2021-04-28T14:33:56Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.32, 0.63], "China's GDP grew by 18.3 percent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2021.\nExcepting something within that range for Q2 (also seen the years before). \nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-14/what-to-watch-for-in-china-s-unprecedented-gdp-growth-report"], [96450, "2021-04-28T13:15:44Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5], "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-14/what-to-watch-for-in-china-s-unprecedented-gdp-growth-report"], [87175, "2021-04-27T20:47:59Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.4, 0.25], ""], [98281, "2021-04-27T18:31:10Z", [0.0, 0.03, 0.35, 0.42, 0.2], ""], [49877, "2021-04-27T17:10:45Z", [0.05, 0.1, 0.4, 0.3, 0.15], ""], [27661, "2021-04-27T10:26:04Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.27, 0.5, 0.22], "https://global.matthewsasia.com/insights/sinology/2021/is-this-the-real-life-is-this-just-fantasy/"], [13306, "2021-04-27T05:24:54Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.6, 0.3], ""], [27661, "2021-04-26T21:30:47Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.23, 0.5, 0.26], ""], [27661, "2021-04-26T21:30:29Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.23, 0.41, 0.35], ""], [95503, "2021-04-26T16:28:48Z", [0.0, 0.02, 0.16, 0.45, 0.37], ""], [1333, "2021-04-26T13:29:59Z", [0.1, 0.2, 0.23, 0.23, 0.24], ""], [96450, "2021-04-26T10:10:20Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.3, 0.7], ""], [18679, "2021-04-26T09:54:29Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0], ""], [96757, "2021-04-26T05:44:21Z", [0.0, 0.02, 0.26, 0.46, 0.26], ""], [29054, "2021-04-25T14:37:17Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.67, 0.33, 0.0], ""], [95503, "2021-04-25T13:26:13Z", [0.0, 0.02, 0.16, 0.5, 0.32], ""], [1333, "2021-04-25T11:12:29Z", [0.1, 0.21, 0.22, 0.23, 0.24], ""], [13306, "2021-04-25T09:28:25Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.15, 0.52, 0.33], ""], [93195, "2021-04-24T18:39:59Z", [0.0, 0.02, 0.43, 0.44, 0.11], ""], [91722, "2021-04-24T18:37:35Z", [0.01, 0.01, 0.32, 0.33, 0.33], "While Q1 growth of 18.3% has a large base effect embedded in it and also has benefitted greatly from sharp rebound in domestic consumption, the momentum is likely to weaken somewhat but still be enough to make 8% or higher a strong probability for Q2.

Comparing nominal GDP numbers to the index China has reported I'm estimating that inflation is low, which makes sense when coming out of a recession, so that shouldn't be subtracting from the nominal growth numbers too much. In a normal year Q2 is generally about 4.5% to 6.3% below the GDP of the previous Q4. Even if Q2 2021 is 6.3% below Q4 2020 the GDP for Q2 2021 would be 27.76 trillion yuan, which would be about 11% over the GDP for Q2 2020 of 25.01 trillion yuan.

First, the large amount of privately held debt (as much as %188 of GDP per the IMF: https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/PVD_LS@GDD/CHN). Second, the semi-export focus of the current Chinese economy and the desire by the regime to increase the ratio of domestic to foreign consumption of Chinese products (https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/voa-news-china/china-plans-lift-economy-boosting-consumption#:~:text=Consumption%20growth,manufacturing%2Doriented%20economy%20remain%20stable.) As domestic consumption can only grow slowly compared to growing export focus (growing domestic consumption requires growing internal wealth which takes time vs. selling exports to gain wealth from other countries' consumers which already have it).

I'm putting more confidence in the higher buckets after looking at this more closely. Q2 of 2020 was not as bad for China as Q1, but it was definitely lower over the previous year than is typical. This leaves a lot of room for growth in Q2 since Q2 2020 is a lower baseline. I looked at numbers a couple different ways. One method was to see how Q2 of a typical year compares to Q3 of the previous year. The lowest of these comparisons was 3.45% growth in 2019. If I assume Q2 of 2021 is 3.45% larger than Q3 of 2020 that would put Q2 of 2020 at about 10.10% higher than Q2 of 2019. I also checked based on 2 year growth trends for typical years to estimate what Q2 of 2021 might be using Q2 of 2019. A conservative look at that still puts Q2 of 2021 at around 8.3% growth. One thing to be careful of is that the numbers I'm using are nominal, or not adjusted for inflation. I believe most of the time the real GDP growth is used, which is inflation adjusted. If China reports real GDP growth for quarterly numbers then my estimates could likely be higher than what China would report. Hopefully I can figure out how to see their reported quarterly growth rates to compare and see what kind of adjustment I should make for that. This is one of the biggest factors making me uncertain right now. The other is the possibility of a new coronavirus wave that depresses economic activity in Q2 of 2021. But overall I'm fairly confident in higher numbers. The OECD expects 8% annual growth for China in 2021 (real). That's not super useful for figuring out what Q2 might be because Q1 will have a large amount of growth since Q1 of 2020 was very bad.
