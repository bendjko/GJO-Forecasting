All indicators that I'm seeing point toward a challenge for the GOP to hold on to their two seat majority, particularly given that 6 out of 7 battleground states (apparently) are Republican held at the moment.  (I can't help noticing this is the opposite of the situation Democrats faced in the US Senate last year.)  The GOP do have a strong track record in Virginia for several decades--I'm weak on that knowledge, but that's my vague idea--but that seems to be turning the other way, with demographic changes.  Of course that's largely in Northern Virginia, and the vote in the rural Senate districts may still reflect that more traditional, White Southern demographic, giving them an edge in those seats.  But the swing districts are mostly in the more urbanized areas of greater Richmond, as well as Virginia Beach, and suburban DC.  There's time for Republican surge in popularity and energy--maybe partly as a backlash against the impeachment?  But we're getting close now too--November 5.  So yeah, I'm going to tweak a bit more in the Dems' favor.   https://cnu.edu/wasoncenter/surveys/2019-10-07-va-leg-1/ \"This statewide survey finds Democrats carrying significant interest and enthusiasm advantages heading into the final stages of the campaign.

Since 1991, the GOP has won the senate 3 times, the Dems 2 times, and twice there has been no overall control. (1995 + 2011). Of the 7 seats identified as possibilities to flip to the other side, 6 are GOP to Dem. I think that 3 or 4 of these (district 7, 10, 12 + 17) are likely to flip, which would give the Dems control of the Virginia state senate (https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/09/04/cheat-sheet-the-house-and-senate-races-most-likely-to-decide-control-of-virginias-statehouse/ - https://ballotpedia.org/Virginia_State_Senate_elections,_2019#Background). These seats have a combination of a small majorities and consistently voting for the Dems over the past few election cycles. There is also an early indication the Dems will be spending more money on this election than they previously have done.  Turnout in the 4 year election cycles for the senate and house has been lower than other years, probably due to the lack of congressional or gubernatorial elections (https://www.elections.virginia.gov/resultsreports/registration-statistics/registrationturnout-statistics/index.html). As a result of these factors, and that Trump has had a consistent negative approval rating over the past 2 years in the state (https://morningconsult.com/tracking-trump-2/) I am going to predict a Dem majority in this election.
