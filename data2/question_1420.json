They have, for the most part, been really adamant about staying the course. In a purely economic sense, the Coronavirus is having a supply-side impact, and monetary policy is a demand-side solution. So in a certain sense, a rate cut at this point would not be that helpful. And yet...and yet...it just doesn't always work that way. The markets are tanking.  The markets are tanking and there could be a spillover from Wall Street to Main Street as investors head for bonds and liquidity dries up.  The markets are tanking and there is a lot of pressure on the Fed to do something.   At the one end there are calls for an emergency meeting to cut rates. At the other end, Tim Duy says that Chairman Powell should at least acknowledge that the Fed might cut rates at some point.  And then there is the Rate Cutter-in-Chief, who has never let up on his screams for rate cuts. I think the Fed is between a rock and a hard place here.  If they cut rates soon, it will almost certainly be seen as capitulating to markets (as opposed to their mission).  This narrative played out once before between late-2018 and mid--2019, and it's not one that Fed officials like.  On the other hand, if they remain adamantly hawkish, they risk being seen as blind and deaf to the unfolding crisis and potential economic impacts. I'm going to stick with a 99% unchanged rate forecast for 18 March. I'm basically in an \"in for a dime, in for a dollar\" mode, and I don't think changing my forecast to reflect the amount of uncertainty surrounding the question would really make any difference.  To the extent that I think there's something meaningful to say in the way of justification, I think a material pivot this soon after such staunch statements of staying the course might be perceived as being wishy-washy and beholden to Wall Street.
