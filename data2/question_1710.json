Another factor is the support that Egypt has from Turkey, with a threatening posture that could force Libya to respond (Al Jazeera, 2020).

This conflicted is highly covered as both countries have their own stability on the line but additionally, other nations have been brought into the mix, \n\u201cthe Libyan crisis is a significant challenge to Egypt\u2019s domestic stability and political legitimacy. Since 2013, the conflict has been of strong geopolitical importance for Cairo due to the strategic convergence between UAE and Saudi Arabia and their support for Haftar\u2019s war against the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA)-the latter being backed by Turkey and Qatar\u201d (Atlantic Council, 2020). \nAs discussed from the Atlantic Council, the conflict with Libya not only affects the capital city of Egypt, Cairo, but also the UAE and Saudi Arabia. After months of relative peace, it seems the conflict is beginning to intensify again, \u201cEgypt\u2019s President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi said last month that Egypt could send troops into Libya, warning GNA forces not to cross the current frontline between them and LNA. In response, the GNA said it considered el-Sisi\u2019s comments a \u2018declaration of war\u2019\u201d (AlJazeera, 2020). It is my opinion that neither country wants to actually go to war or have deadly conflict. It appears that both countries want diplomatic independence while not appearing weak to one another; \u201cPresident Sisi had drawn a line in the sand \u2013 between Sirte on the Mediterranean and the area around the Jufra airbase in central Libya \u2013 as Egypt\u2019s \u2018red line\u2019 \u201c(BBC, 2020). This notion is further backed up by The International Crisis Group, \u201cfor regional actors, Egypt in particular, the stakes transcend Libya and its oil sector. Their main concern is defending their vision of the regional order\u201d (The International Crisis Group, 2020). It is quite clear that Egypt wants to avoid war at all costs, but understands the notion that there may come a time where they have to respond with force. If Egypt is put in a position where they do not respond forcefully, they will not be taken seriously in the Middle East. With all of this considered I put a lethal confrontation of a probability of 13%. \nMelcangi, A., and Dentice, Giuseppe. (2020, June 18). Libya\u2019s crisis is a tough puzzle to solve for Egypt.

Public support for the government of Lebanon and Hezbollah has fallen due to incompetence observed before and immediately after the explosion as Hezbollah refused to cease control of the Lebanese Finance Ministry in a newly formed government (Deeb, 2020; Times of Israel, 2020). However, the energy behind the initial protests has decreased significantly, with recent protests being significantly smaller in size and comprised of primarily minority populations (Vohra, 2020). Once believed to be on the brink of another civil war where Hezbollah would be focused on internal struggles, the Iranian backed terrorist organization has demonstrated its desire to continue to attack IDF forces, inciting a cross border firefight on 25 August 2020 (Vohra, 2020; Gross, 2020). The IDF returned fire and reportedly utilized military helicopters and aircraft to target Hezbollah positions across the border in Lebanon (Hendrix & Sly, 2020). No casualties were reported by either side after the altercation. The location where Hezbollah engaged IDF troops was between two camps of UN peacekeepers, and was suspected to be an attempt by Hezbollah to have the IDF to accidentally kill the UN forces (Hendrix & Sly, 2020).\n\tEngaging in a firefight less than a month after the explosion, as well as the IDF\u2019s willingness to utilize military aircraft to target Hezbollah positions indicates tensions on the border are largely unchanged. Recent fighting against one another within Syria resulted in the death of a Hezbollah fighter, likely contributing to the escalation on the border (The Defense Post, 2020). Clearly evident that despite the explosion and subsequent public uproar, Hezbollah remains steadfast in its fight against Israel. However, both sides are actively avoiding all-out war, likely attempting to avoid inflicting significant casualties (Bassam, 2020). With one month remaining, I propose a 15% probability that a lethal confrontation will occur between Hezbollah and Israel prior to 14 November.  https://www.thedefensepost.com/2020/08/31/hezbollah-israel-soldiers/\n\nhttps://www.timesofisrael.com/hezbollah-carried-out-border-shooting-under-peacekeepers-noses-israel-tells-un/ https://www.dw.com/en/israel-lebanon-maritime-borders-us-backed-talks/a-55133674 https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/world/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-fighting.html https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/israel-strikes-hezbollah-posts-in-lebanon-after-taking-fire/2020/08/26/e08c2bae-e767-11ea-bf44-0d31c85838a5_story.html https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/lebanons-powerhouse-hezbollah-hit-by-backlash-after-blast/2020/08/30/b4470994-ea8f-11ea-bf44-0d31c85838a5_story.html https://www.timesofisrael.com/defying-macron-hezbollah-says-it-will-continue-to-fight-israel/ https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-lebanon-hezbollah/hezbollah-says-all-out-war-with-israel-unlikely-in-coming-months-idUSKCN24R0S6\n"], [31275, "2020-10-09T16:25:54Z", [0.01], ""], [56, "2020-10-09T15:34:15Z", [0.35], ""], [95394, "2020-10-08T21:34:28Z", [0.31], "I assess a 31% chance of the proscribed event occurring. The conflict between these two groups will not escalate to conflict at a high enough level by 25 November 2020 to occasion the loss of five more Egyptian troops. Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi made a dramatic announcement when he stated that Egypt was prepared to move into Libya should national interests be threatened by the current unrest in this region. This proclamation was given with a \u201cred line in the sand\u201d. While not an idle threat, historical trends between these two countries have shown frequent posturing and little action. In February 2015, an Egyptian aircraft conducted several raids on positions belonging to extremist groups inside Libya in response to the slaughter of 21 Egyptian Copts at the hands of ISIS. Cairo is likely to continue this use of force with a limited intervention to securing the border area inside Libya and it could back up such an operation with airstrikes upon pro-Tripoli forces of the Government of National Accord, should they seek to advance. With Sirte located 1,000km from the Egyptian border deploying troops to central Libya would pose significant logistical challenges for the Egyptian army, lengthening supply lines and promising only inconsistent air cover to ground troops. Egypt\u2019s rumored plan to transfer weapons to eastern Libyan tribal groups seems a more likely alternative to direct action. Currently actions by Egypt have shown distrust of this government due to its political Islam and ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, a group which Egypt has historically persecuted. Turkish and Egyptian troops potentially coming into close contact and pro-Russia private military fighters who are also in the fray risks a wider regional confrontation and overt escalation, something not desired by Egypt or its\u2019 allies.\n\tAn intervention that could expose Egyptian troops to a direct confrontation with the Turkish military and affiliated Syrian fighters in central Libya is still a possibility. Private military contractors of the Russian-owned Wagner company are also consolidating a presence in central Libya, reportedly operating fighter jets in Jufra and bringing in reinforcements to Sirte and the oil terminal areas in a bid to bolster the Haftar forces\u2019 positions there. France, the UAE, and several other neighboring countries, also share the same supposition concerning Libya's threat to regional stability. Outside interference is largely focused around the drilling stations scattered throughout the region. This combined pressure will most likely result in punitive proxy engagement with potential airstrikes in contrast to outright conventional military action against a largely guerrilla force. \n\tIt should also be noted that sate media and that belonging to nations who have interests in the country have utilized propaganda incessantly in an attempt to legitimize their claims. Three primary channels exist, Libya Al Ahrar, the most balanced but displayed a cautiously anti-Islamist institutionalist agenda, Al Nabaa, which is a staunchly islamic supporter of the revolutionaries, and Libya Awalan, which is conservative anti-Islam. These sources have combined to create a more complicated picture than necessary and overhypes the violence playing out on the ground.

There is a possibility that Egyptian forces will launch incursions into Libya to counter what they see as encroachments on their border.

Egypt has so far lost no soldier in the Libyan conflict, despite a brief air campaign. And despite the threat of troop deployment, no troops are currently on the ground. So starting probability is low (5-10ish%) In order for there to be 5 losses, Egyptian troops need to be 1) deployed and 2) engaged in combat.  The deployment could be expected if the \"red line\" established by Sisi is crossed (https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-53779425). And though I can't find progression analyses, we know that GNA+Turkey has been pushing Haftar lately and we know that they are not far from the red line (https://libya.liveuamap.com/ - a great source btw.) In fact, there are (turkish-aligned) reports of a military build-up of both sides around Sirte, though the town is also a point of much of international attention and dissuasion. The possibility of the red line being crossed is really unclear but feels closer to no (45-49%). The announced \"intervention\" then might take a few forms, from training and weapons to direct intervention. But given that the first two kind of happen already and don't help too much, Egypt might indeed have to engage in combat quite early on after the deployment.  Now to the ceasefire: there is an (albeit wobly) one, but the few similar events in the past have not been very effective. If broken, there might soon be a battle over Sirte (see above) - its relevance therefore currently doesn't feel great.  Finally a regional consideration. A proxy war is less costly than an open confrontation, but still not something Sisi or Erdogan should want. This threat of use is valuable in itself and though he made the mistake of drawing a red line, I don't think Sisi would want to escalate this one without due consideration. This pushes down the overall chance of Sisi justifying to himself and to the public Egypt's engagement in Libya before November (10-15%). Combining the chances that Sirte falls into the hands of GNA, that Egypt follows through on its promise, that they engage in combat and that they have at least 5 fatalities before the date, the final score feels like a strong no (15%)."], [87064, "2020-08-24T19:26:30Z", [0.05], ""], [31275, "2020-08-24T19:09:05Z", [0.12], "Both sides calling fir ceasefire.

At the moment, Egypt is primarily posturing, and has not allowed requirement (a) to be realized. However, they have drawn a line in the sand and stated in no uncertain terms that any Libyan militants loyal to the opposition crossing that line would be classified as a national security threat and lead to an invasion. A full-fledged invasion would likely spur on both (a) and (b), but how likely is this.\nWell, baseline, since Egypt overthrew Morsi in 2013, there have only been three occassions where more than 5 Egyptians have been killed in a single conflict with Libyan militia. Of these three incidents, only two killed more than 5 armed Egyptian forces and the other one was the only that occurred on Libyan soil, meaning none of these events meet this criteria. However, if we take the total number of conflicts resulting in 5 or more Egyptian deaths, that gives us 3 in 7 years, or a roughly 43% chance each year. With less than four months left, this goes down to around 14%.\nHowever, the line in the sand is not the Egyptian border, it is drawn across Libya, making the odds of they are crossed much higher, say 28%. Moreover, Turkey is now vocally supporting Libyan rebels campaign against Egypt, which is likely to embolden them towards more aggressive actions. So raise it to 42%. The line being crossed, however, does not necessarily mean Egypt will invade since their only motivation will be to save face since the line itself is not all that close to the Egyptian border. I'd say there is around a 70% chance they would commit troops if this did occur, leaving us with 29%. If troops are committed, I'd give it a 90% chance that more than 5 are killed (assuming it is a fair amount of troops), though whether this is before November 25th depends entirely on when they are deployed.

Egypt want to maintain influence over Libya (and in particular, its oil) and fear that Turkey are beginning to grow to powerful in the region. Turkey want Egypt to back down and evacuate key areas they claim rightfully belong to Libya. Neither side benefits from an all-out war, but both sides gain leverage from posturing. With the US, Russia, and the UN now taking key positions and (at least outwardly) supporting peace talks and discussions, as well as a ceasefire, it would make even less sense for either country to ramp up tensions further. If a full-fledge war breaks out, Egypt will lose control of the region completely and will likely get none of the benefits of Libyan gas deposits while Turkey would likely be forced to watch even more areas of Libya cut out and controlled by various organizations (foreign and domestic) and the whole country descend further into chaos. Looking at it from a different angle, the Iraq war was waged under similar conditions (war-torn region, oil depots, insurrections, multiple foreign interests and actors) for 3,195 days (officially). In that time-frame, the US reportedly lost over 4,400 troops. If we assume all casualties were in groups of five and due to direct military confrontations (both of which are incorrect), we get an event meeting this criteria every 3.61 days. This is the maximum rate that could have been achieved for the 8 years of warfare. Since the Egyptian army is around 1/3 the size of the US's, let's assume the maximum rate they could achieve would be around one set of five casualties every 10.83 days. Now, it would take time for this rate to be reached. So far, there have been no casualties from Egyptian forces in the time frame described, which suggests that we are nowhere near a large conflict every 11 days. Moreover, it must be Egyptian troops suffering the losses, not American or Russian or Libyan or Turkish. This, too, seems unlikely since Egypt will likely not go to war if it is not supported by a larger power (Russia) and, if it is supported by a larger power it is unlikely to commit a large number of its own troops towards invading. More likely, it would begin running covert, specialized, and concentrated missions in concert with larger countries to help further its leverage and destabilize the region.  Basically, as things stand, it seems a ceasefire is at least as likely as increased military presence, if not more so, and even if the latter were to occur, there would still need to be a medley of events and decisions made to meet the criteria of this question. I think the most likely scenario to turn this to a 'Yes' would be an accident or misunderstanding that leads to half-a-dozen or more deaths, which is relatively unlikely given the players involved, their priorities, and the current state of play."], [89013, "2020-08-11T12:16:27Z", [0.33], ""], [57778, "2020-08-10T23:35:49Z", [0.13], ""], [13306, "2020-08-10T02:53:13Z", [0.55], "Not a lot has happened in the seven weeks since Egypt's parliament authorized intervention on the Western front if necessary.

The most likely area of conflict would be Sirte, especially if GNA forces attempt to push into the city (with Turkish support) [1]. Further, the more forces Turkey place in Libya will most likely result in an increase in the number of forces Egypt uses in Libya [2]. Tensions between Turkey and Egypt have been exacerbated by the alliances they are in, specifically in regards to Russia [3].  Russia has been accused of selling arms to Libyan groups and t a prolonged conflict would create a large profit for the Russian government while allowing them an operational test bed for their advanced weapon systems [4]. As Turkey is a NATO member, this could create an interest for the US (and other NATO members) to get involved in the conflict in order to combat Russian interference/influence. Ultimately, an armed conflict benefits all parties involved in this scenario.
