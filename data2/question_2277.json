From now to May 25 of 2022, the chance of President Zelensky ceasing his presidency seems to be slim for numerous reasons. One of them is that the war, and or battle, is far from over. The war has been going on since February of this year and now it is May, which means that neither side has won or surrendered. Additionally, Ukraine seems to be holding up pretty well, receiving militarism and economical assistance to fight through the war. The only times I would see Zelensky possible stepping down would be if he was captured or if anyone close to him, including high-ranking officials and or family, were to be captured in return for him stepping down. Another reason we would see him step down would be if he were to be killed, however, since everyone around him is more than likely heavily armed, this also seems to not be likely to occur.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0"], [368, "2022-05-20T11:36:43Z", [0.0], ""], [94783, "2022-05-20T11:23:52Z", [0.0], ""], [37893, "2022-05-20T07:11:33Z", [0.0], ""], [40636, "2022-05-20T05:06:53Z", [0.0], ""], [103945, "2022-05-20T00:21:22Z", [0.03], "Updating forecast based on approaching deadline and comments posted by @jnnh and @SeniorEagles\u00a0"], [101036, "2022-05-19T20:49:43Z", [0.0], ""], [106325, "2022-05-19T18:47:32Z", [0.03], "President Zelensky will not flee Ukraine or cease to be its president before May 25.

The PzH 2000 is one of the most powerful conventional artillery systems deployed in the 2010s. It is capable of a very high rate of fire; in burst mode it can fire three rounds in nine seconds, ten rounds in 56 seconds, and can\u2014depending on barrel heating\u2014fire between 10 and 13 rounds per minute continuously.[1][unreliable source?] The PzH 2000 has automatic support for up to 5 rounds of Multiple Rounds Simultaneous Impact (MRSI). The replenishment of shells is automated. Two operators can load 60 shells and propelling charges in less than 12 minutes. PzH 2000 has also been selected by the armies of Italy, Netherlands, Greece, Lithuania, Hungary, Qatar and Croatia, mostly replacing older systems such as the M109 howitzer. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panzerhaubitze_2000 I can see a lot of future business for that gun around die welt.

At this point, it seems to be clear that taking Kiev would have been a long drawn out affair filled with casualties. The Russian military does not seem to have the moral or political will to continue along this path. Instead -- as I initially suspected -- it appears the focus will shift East of the Dnieper river. Where taking control of the Donetsk and Luhansk region and connecting the Crimea Peninsula to the rest of Russia via a land bridge appears to be the main objective at this time. Something Putin could surely sell as a victory at home. This means I see the likelihood of Zelensky being forced out or killed in a military action has fallen to basically negligible in my mind. I still think there is a chance of some more covert assassination attempt, but if I am going to be honest I think this would only galvanize the nation against Russia and probably would be unwise strategically. (Same reason I think indiscriminate levelling of Kiev is out of the picture, too much blowback.) At this point we appear to have fought to a standstill; a point where negotiation may bear fruit. Talks appear to be progressing reasonably, and I can see the rough outline of a possible off ramp for both sides starting to emerge.

The only way Zelensky steps aside is if negotiators threaten to abandon the talks, leaving Ukraine to face Russian carpet bombing. I am thinking of Bosnia here.

That is, even if Putin occupies a large area of Ukraine, air operations will become more and more difficult the farther they are undertaken from their home bases.  Moreover, the extreme southwestern end of Ukraine is in and behind the Carpathian mountains, and borders Rumania and Hungary. So this can serve as a final redoubt, more or less easily defensible, and easily supplied by the West. So I am not entirely sure that Zelensky will have to flee and set up a government in exile. If things get so bad he can still exercise the presidency of Ukraine from within Ukrainian territory. So that means the real threat is whether he will be assassinated. The press is full of reports about how Zelensky has survived multiple attempts on his life after being tipped off by anti-war Russian FSB agents.

Looking at the logistical blunders of the Russian army so far, it doesn't seem feasible that they can invade Western Ukraine, and it probably isn't their goal anyway. If this scenario comes true, Russia might install a puppet in Kyiv, but it seems unlikely that either other countries or the Ukranian army and citizens would recognize this person, so we should still consider Zelensky to be the president.  It is more likely that he will get killed and captured, which is dependent on how the war progresses. While it might seem that there's a long time till 25 May, you have to consider that the ground is already thawing, and it will soon become a boggy mess in many parts of the country, which will turn the offensive into a logistical nightmare. While mounting an attack in these circumstances isn't impossible, as vehicles can move on the roads, but their progress will be slowed down considerably, since destroyed vehicles and roadblocks can stop convoys for a long time (not mention they will become sitting ducks for Bayraktar attacks). So if Kyiv can hold on for a week or two, it might become extremely hard to capture it.  Whether it can stand is an interesting question, and it is hard to answer in probabilities, but I think it has a good chance. Although the Southern campaign is going well for Russia, a successful establishment of a corridor between Crimea and the separatists won't affect the situation in Kyiv for anytime soon. (It might if the main forces of the Ukranian army get encircled and finished, so the Southern and Eastern Russian troops can make a move for Kyiv, but the Ukranians can still switch to guerilla tactics to slow down the offense.) So far the Ukranian Army has put on a very tough and successful resistance in the Northern and Northeastearn part of the country, and we can assume that the Russian army will have the most trouble in this region, which spells good news for Kyiv. Although the city hasn't experienced much serious fighting yet (the clashes were mostly with Russian diversant and saboteurs), its defenders have thus far successfully prevented the capture of all the major airports near the city, rendering the Russians unable to drop troops there. It's likely that the worst is yet to come, but the army and the citizenry appear highly motivated, and urban warfare is always a nightmare for the attackers, especially in city this big, and with a population willing to defend it to the end. The siege might take so long that the time window for the invasion will close for Russia (either because of the thawing, or because of economic sanctions destroy the country's economy). During a succesful siege (or even during and unsuccessful one) Zelensky might meet his end at the hands of the Russians, but there's a team around him ready for extraction. It's true that he has stated he wouldn't flee, but that might have been rhetoric, and relocating to Lviv seems like a more sensible option than going down, provided his team can execute it.

This is likely the lower bound, US invasion had large backing, well funded/planned, no sanitcation, and a very large difference in military power. (Yes)\nOperation Defensive Shield - Israel incursion into the West Bank, the stated goals were to catch and apprehenden terrorists. It lasted from March 29, 2002 to May 10, 2002 (42 days). That would lead to President Z would either flee or not be the President by April 6. The stated goals and difference in military power make this a weak comparison. (Yes)\nUS Invasion of Iraq - Lasted from March 20, 2003 to May 1, 2003 (43 days). Similar in comparison to the Afghanistan invasion. That would lead to President Z would either flee or not be the President by April 6 by April 7. (Yes)\nIsraeli Operation in Rafah - Not comparable.\nLebanon War - Cease fire came into effect due to additional pressure on Israel. Under this scenario President Z would not flee. (No)\nSomalia War - Weak comparison but the war lasted +2 years.\nInvasion of Anjouan - One day invasion where the leader fled, we can ignore this case.\nRusso-Georgian War - Only lasted 12 days but the leader did not flee or was overthrown.\nIsreal invasion into Gaza - Not comparable.\n1st Russia Ukraine War - Not fully comparable as was a group of independent fights.\nOperation Protective Edge - Israel Gaza conflict, not comparable.\n2017 Invasion of Gambia - Ongoing +2 year war\nUAB takeover of Socotra - Not comparable. Not surprising most cases are not comparable. The US invasions place President Z being overthrown by early to mid April. Given the asymmetry of power and lack of external forces those examples are likely downward bias. The economic cost to Russia of the sanctions may become untenable by that timeline, increasing the chances of a ceasefire. Given the expected timelines (early/mid April), cost of the sanctions, external pressure and poor early start to the invasions I believe it is unlikely President Z will flee or not be president by May 25. Reasons for updates will be based on military & ceasefire progress.\n"], [103822, "2022-03-02T16:06:29Z", [0.67], ""], [73970, "2022-03-02T15:08:47Z", [0.17], ""], [105115, "2022-03-02T14:57:55Z", [0.6], "40%->60%\nhttps://rpubs.com/ohma123/872824\n"], [105233, "2022-03-02T14:53:40Z", [0.2], "He started to be seen as HERO, a status which is hard to quit.

I think if they (the Russians) get their act together (including being able to sustain the economic sanctions), it will be very hard for the Ukrainian military to have any kind of coherence by the end of March.

In Iraq (the closes analog that I'm aware of) this stopped after less than a week, with pockets of resistances taking about a month to be broken (and the coalition declaring \"mission accomplished\"). And even then Saddam was only captured 9 months after the beginning of the invasion. Not sure when he stopped to be considered the president though. But I expect to see a number of high-profile successes for the Russians either this or next week: At least the withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from the east, to prevent encirclement, which would retain some level of central control.
