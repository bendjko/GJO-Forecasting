In the following article, the author writes, \"Under the law, a technical command center would be tasked with overseeing the fleet remotely should any trouble ensue.\" If Germany has such a law in place, why would China not follow similarly both as a logical reason but also as a proxy. Still, anything can happen in China. With something so autonomous, I expect there to be in place regulations that would cause this to resolve NO.
