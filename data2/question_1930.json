Left wing groups accounted for the remaining 10% of incidents, had 20% chance of getting stopped and 10% chance of causing casualties.  This data doesn't account for the increased reporting on right wing groups since 2016. and I haven't gone through it for causation but it looks like right wing groups are the most likely to cause casualties and are unlikely to be stopped. This may have changed in the wake of this year's incident since law enforcement is now specifically looking for right wing threats.

Additionally, analysis has shown that a rise in right-wing extremism would be the most likely source of domestic terror attacks in the US over the next three to five years [3]. Due to the increased government attention on domestic terrorism due to the insurrection at the US capitol, I do not expect a major domestic terror attack to take place in the United States during the timeframe of this question. Additionally, with multiple schools closed, and many public activities shut down throughout the country (including large-scale gatherings at sports events and most churches) for at least the first half of 2021, the opportunities for a mass casualty domestic terrorist event are more limited than they would be otherwise.

As another user pointed out, there have been seven officially recognized domestic terror incidents since 2000 which meet this criteria according to the most readily available source, which is the Wikipedia entry for domestic terror in the US; A notable omission from this list was the Las Vegas strip shootings in 2017, which should be labeled domestic terror. Including this incident gives me approximately eight acts within the past 20\u00b1 years which meet the above criteria, and which results in approximately 40% chance of such an act occurring within any given year during that period based on the total incidents. Given a time adjustment of about 4.1% as we are forty-one days into year 2021, we now have a remaining percentage of approximately 35.9%. Other considerations should be made for the strategy adjustments made by security personnel and intelligence agency personnel tasked with thwarting domestic terror threats, as it can be reasonably assumed that the current state of overall security forces are rather heightened and sensitive to any potential domestic terror threats after the DC riots. It would be reasonable to expect that this presence will lead to a reduction the probability of an act occurring in the the short-term, and as such, I would estimate that this decreases the odds of a domestic act of terror occurring by about 20% (or a one-in-five chance), leaving us with a 15.9% probability of occurrence that within the next year and act will occur which satisfies the criteria of this question.

This will be 'off the cuff', with a considered assessment, BUT, here's a quick starter.. Despite the fears of international terrorist plots in the United States associated with Millennium celebrations, domestic special-interest or single-issue domestic terrorists committed 8 of the 10 terrorist incidents recorded in the United States during the calendar year; the remaining two incidents were perpetrated by rogue right-wing extremists. These 10 incidents doubled the number of terrorist incidents recorded the previous year. Six terrorist incidents in 1999 were attributed to an extremist movement known as the Animal Liberation Front (ALF). Combined, these attacks resulted in financial damages (primarily to medical research facilities) of more than three million dollars. Two acts of terrorism were attributed to a distinct but related movement known as the Earth Liberation Front (ELF). These attacks resulted in the complete destruction of an 8,000-square-foot office complex in Monmouth, Ore., and one million dollars in damage to the Agricultural Hall at Michigan State University. None of the incidents resulted in human casualties. For the sixth consecutive year, there were no successful acts of international terrorism perpetrated in the United States in 1999. An overview of international terrorism over the last three decades has been the most destructive in history. Over 14,000 international terrorist attacks have occurred worldwide since 1968. These attacks have resulted in more than 10,000 deaths. Between 1980 and 1999, the FBI recorded 327 incidents or suspected incidents of terrorism in the United States. Of these, 239 were attributed to domestic terrorists, and 88 were determined to be international. Combined, these acts resulted in the deaths of 205 persons and in the injury of over 2,037. Although the United States and the world now experience fewer acts of terrorism when compared to figures from the 1970's and 1980's, a troubling trend toward more destructive attacks has tempered this positive development. U.S. intelligence and law enforcement communities have developed an effective and highly integrated response to the challenge of terrorism. As the lead agency in the fight against terrorism in the United States, the highest priority of the FBI's Counterterrorism Program is to prevent acts of terrorism from occurring, but when acts do occur, the FBI mounts aggressive investigations to identify and apprehend the perpetrators. Increasingly, the FBI's efforts involve the assistance and cooperation of other intelligence and law enforcement agencies.

Only seven in the last 50 years, making for a seven percent chance each decade.  The fact that the FBI and DHS are on high alert to White Supremacist plotting is to me a hopeful sign that they are monitoring known threats, making it less likely that those attacks will eventuate.  Covid also makes it more difficult to find venues with large crowds for attacks.  That will change as the year progresses, but genuine terrorist attacks are usually the result of careful planning and rehearsals, all of which take many months. On the down side, the frequency of these sorts of attacks has accelerated.  Six of the seven have happened in the last 25 years and five of seven have occurred in the last 18 years, making a 3.6% chance each year.  Also complicating matters is the decision by social media companies to de-platform White Supremacists groups, making the job of the FBI in monitoring their activities on-line much more difficult as the far-right groups turn to encrypted apps to communicate.[1]  We begin to venture into the territory of unknown unknowns.  Given the far-right's anti-vaccine culture, among the few places likely to have lots of people will be mass vaccination sites, providing them with a target-rich environment of people who they would consider \"The Other\" given their willingness to be vaccinated. A serious attempt on January 6, 2022 would not be a surprise, in my estimate, as the far-right seeks commemoration and retribution for the anniversary of the date on which they believe the U.S. election was stolen from the previous president.  Far-right groups, like their Islamic counterparts, do like the symbolism of launching attacks on dates important to their causes and movement.  For example, Timothy McVeigh's choice of the day for his attack in Oklahoma was designed to commemorate the fiery end and destruction of the Waco, Texas siege of the Branch Davidians.[2]  An attack on January 6, 2022 is beyond the terms of reference of this question, however.\n\n[1] https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/far-right-investigations-encrypted-fbi/2021/01/17/bd7a71ac-580a-11eb-a931-5b162d0d033d_story.html\n[2] https://www.cnn.com/2013/09/18/us/oklahoma-city-bombing-fast-facts/index.html"], [81187, "2021-02-11T00:59:20Z", [0.0], ""], [56115, "2021-02-11T00:41:44Z", [0.05], ""], [70711, "2021-02-11T00:05:52Z", [0.0], "The Capitol riot was violent and huge, but only 7 deaths (5+2suicides) occured.\nA single pipe bomb or Oklahoma City type explosion could exceed 10 fatalities. \nBut..

I assume the perpetrator(s) must actually identify their motive, or a pattern of behavior that can be construed as constituting a motive (as in the El Paso, or Oklahoma City, or Pittsburgh massacres). However, I note that the Cornell definition is: (5) the term \u201cdomestic terrorism\u201d means activities that\u2014\n(A) involve acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State;\n(B) appear to be intended\u2014\n(i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population;\n(ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or\n(iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and... Clause (B) stipulates that the act only has to have the *appearance* of domestic terrorism. As the explanation of this question hints, more than one person in the press or government characterized the Capitol riot was an instance of \"domestic terrorism\" by a large number of people including President Biden. It seems like it falls under the Cornell definition because the mob intended to \"influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion;\" that is, stop the certification of the electoral college votes. The fact that they had no hope of doing this, is I suppose, not relevant to their conformity with the Cornell definition. But is it relevant to whether they are terrorists? Not to put too fine a point on it, were they just a bunch of idiots LARPing a revolution? The riots that occurred over the summer in several cities were not domestic terrorism, evidently, even though they arguably \"intend[ed] to intimidate or coerce a civilian population;\" \"influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion;\" and \"affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction...\" Nobody called the rioters terrorists, because they weren't. They were rioters.  So this isn't a question about actions, it's a question of how actions are spun. When are rioters violent yahoos whose actions sometimes wind up causing fatalities, and always wind up causing destruction? Because we've seen plenty of that this year. And when are rioters \"terrorists?\" I guess we'll find out. Nevertheless, my forecast is that the chance is zero.

I will reduce this by 3% (roughly 1/12) since the month of January has already passed so I am now at 32%.

The heightened level of security in the United States likely makes it more difficult to plan and carry out an attack so I will further reduce my forecast by 8% to 19%.
