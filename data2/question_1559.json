And, spoiler alert, my prediction will be based primarily on the assessment of the first part because altogether I don't think the areas will fulfil the requirements of famine and therefore there will be nothing to declare. But all in order: I take the qualification of \"famine\" from the article from FEWS (the 5 levels of food insecurity, 5 being \"famine\") which seems to be a standard metrics in the domain. Looking at the trends in the East Africa region, Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania are out of the question, the situation is getting better and no large areas reach more than level 2. It comes down to Ethiopia and Somalia, the latter being hit the most. Now FEWS, which is a tool designed to predict the severity of food insecurity states that yes, large parts of these two will be in \"crisis\", but that is still two levels away from \"famine\". There was a significant deterioration due to the infamous locust infestation, but even after accounting for that, the tool concluded that the situation will not go as far as to \"famine\". And given how rare such events are, the conclusion seems reasonable. The baseline is therefore fairly low, though the known and uknown unknowns must be accounted for. 5%. What would have to happen for a famine to be declared in one of these countries? Probably a few things at the same time, as individual factors didn't in the past seem to have the effect of turning areas from \"stressed\" (lvl2) or \"crisis\" (lvl3), into \"famine\" (lvl5) in just a few months. Some of the most likely factors are cuts in humanitarian aid, Covid measures, conflict trends, and unexpected weather. Starting from the last, Somalia, which was one of the worst-hit countries is expecting some seasonal rains and harvests (https://fews.net/east-africa/somalia), ethiopia apparently might face under-average harvest in oct-dec 2020 season. The level of conflict in Somalia is high, but hasn't changed in a while. Covid grew in Ethiopia recently but started subsiding again and the measures in place seem to make sure that production\\import of basic goods in ensured (https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/ethiopia/coronavirus), Somalia's data don't indicate that there is a growth or that it worries the authorities too much.   Individually I find these factors' impact on food security in the foreseeable future to be nothing out of the ordinary, and altogether the likelihood of them occurring at the same time feels quite low.

Then P(SS and Y and S and Nigeria) would be 1-10%. If we trust FEWS and I do then P(E or K or S or T or U) would be lower than the event I previously mentioned.

(https://www.worldvision.org/hunger-news-stories/africa-hunger-famine-facts#famine) The last famine listed was in 2017 in Sudan. The last time a famine was declared by the UN in East Africa was in 2011, and it was the first to be declared in the Horn in 30 years (Ethiopia's famine in the 1980s). Usually famine goes hand-in-hand with war, but Somalia but all the countries listed are not at war, nor look to be, any time soon. The only time that it seems famine was caused by locusts was in 1915-1918 under the Mount Lebanon Famine, but this was also during WWI/blockade. So while the locusts are a problem, they are a problem because of an exceptionally good rainy season. Tens of thousands of hectares have already been treated to kill the locusts. This likely wont be enough, but unless there is another significant factor (of which I don't believe there is at this point) then these three countries will be free from famine in 2020. We will likely know for sure by the end of  July, which is when the last East Africa famine took place. https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/somalia/8648296/UN-declares-first-famine-in-Africa-for-three-decades-as-US-withholds-aid.html\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1915_Ottoman_Syria_locust_infestation\nhttp://www.fao.org/ag/locusts/en/info/info/index.html\nhttps://news.un.org/en/search/famine/date/2017?page=2\nhttps://fews.net/"], [19127, "2020-05-01T09:53:09Z", [0.47], ""], [88157, "2020-05-01T01:11:37Z", [0.65], ""], [1333, "2020-04-30T06:46:53Z", [0.73], ""], [85144, "2020-04-29T15:51:41Z", [0.7], ""], [57778, "2020-04-29T09:16:23Z", [0.59], ""], [534, "2020-04-27T18:55:01Z", [0.85], ""], [60948, "2020-04-26T09:56:04Z", [0.5], "Man, most of my uncertainty comes from the definition of \"famine\", rather than from \"things will be bad\", which they will be.

The next thing to note is this is expected to be the worst locust swarm in Kenya in the past 75 years. For Uganda and Somalia,  this would be the worst famine in the past 25 years [2]. In Somalia as early as a year and a half ago there was a famine in 2011. Locusts take about four weeks to grow to full size. The eggs  As it comes to food supply chains there are approximately three key indicators for it being disrupted.  \n1. Food production\n2. Food security\n3. Food distrubution.  Given that (because I have spent a fair amount of time in Africa, and this is literally what my masters is all about). Food distrubution in Africa is already very poor. Now that the locusts are being hatched, after being planted in late March, there is an expectation that it there will be over 1 billion locusts as early as tomorrow. And this brings up an interesting question to me. How much can a locust eat? And how many crops will they destroy.  I  just learned that a locust can eat about their weight in plants per day. And a locust is approximately 2 grams in weight. So that will be 2 billion grams per day and increasing. In Kenya one of the main produces that is grown are sweet potatoes, and there are 153 grams per potatoe.  That would take 75 locusts to eat the potato whole. Let's say that that it takes maybe 25 locust to ruin the potato where someone won't buy it. That would mean there are 40,000,000 potatoes every single day not eatable, and that is 6 billion grams of potatoes gone. But that is not a good enough metric for me. Let's talk about calories since that is directly connected to the malnutrition.  Starvation is considered (and I am being generous now) is 1200 calories. In one sweet potato there are 130 calories, when it is around 150 grams. There are around 50 million people in Kenya which would mean there would need to be about 60 billion calories available to be eaten per day. The locusts would drop it by 10 percent (conveinent), and the other which is already prevelent.  Ergo I am ging to give this a possibility of 74 percent and trending upwards. 1.  https://www.un.org/en/card/53873\n2. https://www.forbes.com/sites/carlieporterfield/2020/04/10/east-africa-braces-for-a-locust-outbreak-possibly-20-times-worse-than-the-first-photos/#5f8fc496faf0\n3. https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/09/1045462\n4. https://qz.com/africa/1836159/locusts-set-to-hit-kenya-east-africa-again-400-times-stronger/\n5. http://www.fao.org/giews/countrybrief/country.jsp?code=KEN\n6. \n"], [57778, "2020-04-11T02:03:21Z", [0.53], ""], [84127, "2020-04-10T22:34:12Z", [0.1], ""], [85954, "2020-04-10T22:01:17Z", [0.71], "Edging the forecast up a bit.\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/carlieporterfield/2020/04/10/east-africa-braces-for-a-locust-outbreak-possibly-20-times-worse-than-the-first-photos/#38c880eefaf0"], [86000, "2020-04-10T14:38:52Z", [0.75], ""], [691, "2020-04-10T11:49:12Z", [0.72], "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/04/kenya-locust-threat-fears-wave-worse-harvests-200410085105060.html\nhttps://apnews.com/517bb5588fc94403f797a2045095dcac Owing to a shortage of misery in that part of the world, the locusts are expected back, more numerous and voracious than before.
