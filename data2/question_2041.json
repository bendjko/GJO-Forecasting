It does not seem likely that rates will rise throughout 2021. The only case that I see a rate rise in 2021 is if inflation really starts to get out of control. Even with the huge inflation prints back in May, the Fed continues to claim that this inflation is \"transitory\" and that things are going as intended. An effective strategy the Fed has been using to calm inflation fears has simply been verbal intervention; they simply state that they're \"talking about tapering\" without actually taking action. This has been proven effective enough that I believe that it will continue to work throughout 2021.
