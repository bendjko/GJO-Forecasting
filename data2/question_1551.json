As of May 21, 2020, news circulated regarding Trump Delaying START negotiations between Russia and the U.S.  in favor of adding China to the nuclear talks. We could consider this an intellectual move in the perspective of the U.S., since China\u2019s rise in nuclear, economic and global social power threaten U.S. hegemony. China has no interest in joining conversations limiting their friends\u2019 (Russia\u2019s) nuclear power, or theirs for that matter. Especially considering that as of May 23rd, Russian and Chinese news sources state that the U.S. discussed holding their first nuclear test in decades, despite Russian and Chinese opposition. This test would be a significant departure from the U.S. defense policy and potentially encourage other countries to grow their nuclear powers in an act to protect themselves.

Marshall Billingslea, a veteran national official appointed to the State Department post last month, said in an exclusive interview that before Moscow begins to think about any kind of extension of the 10-year-old nuclear arms limitation treaty, Russia must \u201cbring the Chinese to the negotiating table\u201d as well. Overall, however, Mr. Billingslea said the United States is not interested in \u201carms control for arms control\u2019s sake,\u201d a criticism leveled at many policymakers and advocates of treaties and negotiations. New START contains \u201cmany glaring deficiencies,\u201d and President Trump is not interested in perpetuating the flawed treaty approved by his predecessor.\n. . .\nChinese government officials have repeatedly said Beijing has no interest in joining three-way talks on an expanded New START deal because their arsenal is far smaller than those of the U.S. and Russia.\n\u201cChina opposes any country talking out of turn about China on the issue of arms control, and will not take part in any trilateral negotiations on a nuclear disarmament agreement,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a news briefing in Beijing this week.\nChinese officials also believe talks will require disclosing information about nuclear forces that will undermine its deterrence. The number of Chinese warheads is not known because of Chinese military secrecy, but is estimated to be at least 250 strategic warheads and an undisclosed number of smaller warheads.\nThe government of Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed extending the New START between the U.S. and Russia for another five years, a move that could be made without congressional approval under the treaty. Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump discussed the standoff over New START in a direct phone call Thursday that also dealt with the coronavirus crisis.\nDuring the call, Mr. Trump \u201creaffirmed that the United States is committed to effective arms control that includes not only Russia, but also China, and looks forward to future discussions to avoid a costly arms race,\u201d the White House said in a statement.\nRussian officials say an unconditional five-year extension would give both sides more time to discuss a multilateral deal involving China, but longtime Putin aide Dmitry Medvedev recently wrote for the Tass news agency that \u201cthe United States does not seek, contrary to what was seen 10 years ago, to engage in a serious, honest and professional dialogue.\u201d\nAsked about Beijing\u2019s refusal to join the talks, Mr. Billingslea said that if China wants to be a great power as its leaders keep saying, they should behave like one and join the arms talks.\n. . . \nMr. Billingslea comes to the arms control post with lengthy experience in government, most recently as a point person at the Treasury Department for international relations, sanctions and other punitive measures that have been key features of the Trump administration\u2019s policies toward adversaries and rogue states.\nA new U.S. arms strategy is nearing completion and, once finished, \u201cI will be willing be to engage the Russians to listen to their views and understand why they are so desperate for the extension of the New START treaty,\u201d he said.\nAsked if Mr. Trump has decided whether to extend the treaty, Mr. Billingslea said, \u201cWe want to understand why the Russians are so desperate for extension, and we want the Russians to explain to us why this is in our interest to do it.\u201d\n. . . \nMr. Billingslea said a new arms agreement with the United States, China and Russia must be binding and contain verifiable and enforceable provisions.\n. . . \nRussia\u2019s economic difficulties put the United States in a strong negotiating position, he said.\n. . . \nMr. Billingslea has not held talks yet with the Russians but noted that Moscow is keen to begin New START extension negotiations.\nChina\u2019s nuclear buildup will be a topic of discussion with Moscow officials, and Mr. Billingslea reiterated that it is in Russia\u2019s interest to persuade Beijing to join arms talks.\n. . . \nFor arms control advocates who say Russia will accelerate its buildup without a New START extension, Mr. Billingslea said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure they aren\u2019t doing that already, at least with their unconstrained nuclear stockpile.\u201d\nHe also noted that Moscow has limited resources for a faster nuclear buildup and will be unable to accelerate its programs.\n\u201cIn my case, you\u2019re talking to someone who has for the past three years very systematically examined the workings of adversarial economies and understands how to use financial tools to support U.S. national security,\u201d Mr. Billingslea said.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMMENT:  I am not reading anything here which suggests that there will be a new deal or much about an agreement to extend, but it sure sounds like Billingslea is getting ready to talk.

Minister Lavrov reportedly expressed a desire to extend the New START Treaty,. . .  Minister Lavrov was specific that Washington must agree to extend New START before Russia would agree to include new Russian systems in future negotiations. Secretary Pompeo reiterated the U.S. position that future arms control talks must embrace the White House desire to include China in a trilateral arms control agreement. Frankly, holding New START hostage to Chinese agreement to join a trilateral negotiation makes no sense. Under New START, Russia and the U.S. are permitted to deploy up to 1,550 nuclear warheads. China maintains a minimum deterrence force that the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency recently stated to be a couple of hundred nuclear warheads. Given this large disparity, China has little to gain from negotiating and has shown little interest in doing so. If Russia and the U.S. can bring their numbers down significantly through a new round of negotiations, there could be a basis then to persuade China to join a trilateral negotiation. .. . . New START is the only U.S.-Russian nuclear treaty still in effect. If the pact is permitted to expire in February 2021, there will be no limits on Russian strategic systems and no inspection regime to verify what types and numbers of systems the Russians are deploying. The Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Intelligence Community are solidly in favor of extending New START because they know what the adverse impact will be on our ability to assess the threat to U.S. interests and our planning to address that threat. A bold approach the U.S. should consider is to enter into a negotiation now with Russia to extend New START at a lower level of 1,000 deployed warheads from the currently authorized 1,550. During the 2010 negotiations on New START, the Joint Chiefs certified that 1,000 would be adequate to support our deterrence strategy. Most of the rest of the New START text could remain the same, and the goal should be to extend the treaty at the lower level quickly and immediately enter into another negotiation to include new systems as the Russians suggest, possibly at even lower levels. The Office of the Secretary of Defense should be tasked to do an analysis to determine how low we could go under 1,000 deployed warheads.   . . . \nExtending New START and entering into negotiations to reduce the numbers of deployed U.S. and Russian strategic systems are both in the U.S. national interest.

This is due to the following reasons: The social/economic issues resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak, the upcoming general election, opposition to negotiations inside the Trump administration, and the desire of the US to make START a multi-lateral treaty. First and foremost, the Trump administration will be heavily focused on domestic issues for the next 2-4 months as the country faces the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the near-term, the administration will be focused on addressing US GDP concerns, which could drop 40% in the second quarter of 2020 [1]. It will also be focused on the record number of unemployed Americans which could reach a total of 20% of the workforce [2]. These issues will force the Administration to focus their attention on how to repair small businesses, gig workers and consumer spending. The second major reason that the Trump administration is unlikely to negotiate the New START treaty before 1 October is because Joseph R. Biden is now the presumptive Democratic nominee. This is important because the New START treaty was negotiated by the Obama administration. If President Donald J. Trump enters into negotiations, or extends it, he could be seen as approving of the job President Obama did on that negotiation. This would go against his long-standing stance that almost everything accomplished by the Obama administration was bad, in fact, President Donald J. Trump denounced the New START as a \u201cbad Obama administration agreement\u201d [3]. It would also put President Donald J. Trump in a position of weakness vis-\u00e0-vis Joseph R. Biden as he was the Vice President during the Obama administration. Any agreement with Russia could also prove to have significant blow-back with the American public, due to his previous interactions with Russia, if the United States comes across as weak at the negotiating table. Thirdly, individuals in (or formerly in) the Trump administration are against extending/negotiating New START for a variety of reasons including new Russian weapon systems and a desire to create a brand new treaty that would increase U.S. leverage across all nuclear weapons, including non-nuclear weapons [4]. In fact, President Donald J. Trump has mentioned replacing New START with a treaty that encompasses all types of nuclear weapons, not just the ones currently included in New START. Finally, the Trump administration has mentioned multiple times, over multiple months, that it wants to include China in the treaty [6]. However, China has stated multiple times that it has no interest in joining negotiations because its nuclear weapon stockpile is significantly smaller than those of the US and Russia [7]. The administration could be using this as a pretense to back away from any negotiations as some in the Trump administration allegedly believe that, \u201cCold War-era arms controls are holding the U.S. back from their \u2018dream of a world of American Nuclear Superiority.\u2019\u201d[8]. This ties in with the Trump administrations apparent beliefs that bi-lateral treaties are antiquated and the US faces a direct military threat from China [9] President Donald J. Trump has also instructed the Department of State to think bigger than just Russia on New START, but DoS is running into difficulties in that regard due to being understaffed and the Administration not having a prioritized list of foreign policy objectives [10]. Ultimately, the Trump administration has had major issues nailing down substantive foreign policy victories. It also has not been receptive to Russian requests to renew the New START treaty [11] and seems to want a wide-ranging tri-lateral agreement that ushers in sweeping reforms. It would also could cause President Donald J. Trump some unneeded political needling from Joseph R. Biden if he embraced the New START treaty due to the Obama administrations involvement in creating that agreement. Finally, the economic impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic will be wide-ranging and, most likely, will take up much of the Trump administrations time and energy as this issue is more important, both politically and to the American people, than the New START treaty. Thus, I assess the probability of negotiations beginning on New START before 1 October 2020 at 1%.

There are several reasons why I believe the Trump administration will not pursue talks. 1. Their wish to include other countries in the new treaty a) hasn't worked and b) even if some countries were willing it would take years. 2) He loves to repeal everything Obama did. Although Obama didn't start the orginal START, he was a proponent and signed during his tenure to extend. 3) Him and his advisers are not fans of regulations on what he can and can't do, particularly to do with security. 4) he has backed out of the Iran nuclear deal and the INF just last week, signalling points 2 and 3.\nHOWEVER, he may succumb to pressure from the democrats in the house who from my reading want an extension to be signed. Additionally, he may want to show his control, power and negotiation skills so close to the election (my thinking have read this nowhere) as an extension could easily be spun into positive publicity for his campaign. Putin and his advisers on the other hand seem to want to pursue negotations. However, they want to add a few things to not allow the US to find as many loopholes as they believe they have.  One additional factor which leads me to believe even more that negotiations will not begin by October is that they have both accused each other within the last year of breaching the agreement. This means that their mutual sucpicsion is high, and their trust in each other to follow the treaty is extremely high, therefore reducing the likelihood of each side to pursue talks.

This situation can be described by a quote from the Economist \u201cBoth sides have reservations that need to be dealt with before an extension can be agreed\u2014but nothing that cannot be overcome given sufficient political will. Serious negotiations need to start soon to get a deal done in time.\u201d (1) It seems likely that there would be serious steps to make these negotiations happen if they would benefit Mr. Trump. In the comment noted by O\u2019Brien on CNN, there is brought to the table the importance of nations, not just the US and Russia- with this in mind, there may be pressures for both parties to move forward in starting the negotiations now rather than later. The sources provided show the importance of negotiations as 2021 will bring the end of the old treaty and the need for the New Start treaty will be crucial (2). Finally, with either pressure in full swings such as the COVID-19 pandemic and US 2020 election underway, I think there is reason to believe negotiations will be pushed back. Though, these same factors make me think that as many things seem out of control at times, the beginning of these negotiations (that may take quite some time) will be even more neccessary going into the Fall of 2020. Based on the factors discussed, I forecast a 45% chance that they will start before October 1, 2020. This forecast also accounts for the fact that negotiations may start in the time after Oct 1 and before Jan 1 2021.
