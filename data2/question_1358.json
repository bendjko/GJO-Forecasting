What will happen on the 31st of January isn't UK leaving the EU. The withdrawal agreement itself states that the actual \"leave\" must be in place by the 31st of Dec 2020, in 11 months, not now. During those 11 months the EU legislation will still apply in the UK and UK will continue to contribute to the funding of EU - that's not really \"leaving\" it, is it? Sure, it's an important step and so on, but in practice any EU citizen traveling/working or having whatever kind of relationship with the UK is not going to feel any differences, yet. I make my prediction considering that what you're trying to ask is \"will the withdrawal agreement actually pass through the UK parliament and will it also be ratified by the EU before the 1st of Feb 2020 - paving the way for what we hope to be a nice Brexit by 31 Dec 2020?\" (having a nice brexit with all the treaties renegotiated is close to an impossible task to do in 11 months - check out historical negotiations over similar treaties even, signed even between friendly states and how long they took to get recognized & signed by both sides, especially when you have 750+ treaties to renegociate) Considering the position Johnson has now and the support he got, the agreement will get passed through the UK parliament, that's why I attribute a 97% probability for it.
