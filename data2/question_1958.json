(https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/gary-gensler-sec-chairman/).  A couple other factors also weigh against this happening before 1 October 2021.\n>Some of the key pieces of Gensler's agenda include climate change and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) related regulation.  The SEC recently put together a commission on these topics and Gensler may want to be pro-active on his agenda.  \n>Pay for order flow and that impact on retail investors seems more of a concern for the SEC.  The SEC filed an order against Robinhood in December of 2020 related to information on payment for order flow and best-execution requirements. https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2020/33-10906.pdf\n>The Robinhood story may be more Net Capital requirements vs nefarious actors (https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/the-somewhat-boring-reason-it-appears-that-robinhood-yanked-trading-on-some-securities/). Capital requirements are one of the key pieces of Dodd-Frank. Regulators wanted more transparency and assurance that margin calls could be met and there were not large losses that made waves across the market. Emphasis on capital requirements is even more relevant after the collapse of Archegos Capital for failing to meet margin calls. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archegos_Capital_Management). It seems counterintuitive for a regulator to punish an entity for following regulations.  \n>Unless there is clear evidence (e.g., a message from a trader)that Robinhood was halting trading to influence the price, the SEC would most likely not send a Wells notice to Robinhood based on this timeline.\n\n"], [1333, "2021-04-05T13:14:24Z", [0.81], ""], [94872, "2021-04-05T00:28:59Z", [0.02], ""], [27461, "2021-04-04T03:02:11Z", [0.0], ""], [100243, "2021-04-04T02:33:29Z", [0.05], ""], [1333, "2021-04-03T14:48:50Z", [0.83], ""], [98516, "2021-04-02T16:29:10Z", [0.05], "-5 due to @Aosgood26's excellent analysis"], [1333, "2021-04-02T13:26:36Z", [0.84], ""], [58785, "2021-04-01T00:37:12Z", [0.1], ""], [100190, "2021-03-31T20:08:21Z", [1.0], ""], [100184, "2021-03-31T17:50:58Z", [0.19], ""], [99176, "2021-03-31T14:30:39Z", [0.1], ""], [1333, "2021-03-31T13:28:08Z", [0.86], ""], [91255, "2021-03-31T01:48:27Z", [0.99], "This may not be \u201ctextbook\u201d market manipulation but the occurrence definitely was.

Robinhood did not have the liquidity to meet the requirements of the clearinghouse, so they had no other option but to restrict buy orders.  https://nysba.org/what-is-the-sec-going-to-do-about-gamestop/\nThis article suggests that the SEC would only go after Robinhood if there were some ulterior motive for manipulating markets (e.g. some relationship with Citadel or Melvin Capital). This claim seems to be an overblown conspiracy theory IMO. There were a number of brokerages that made the same decisions as Robinhood, which suggests to me there is some systemic cause (e.g. the central clearing house raising capital requirements to a level that small brokerages cannot afford).
