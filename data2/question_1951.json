Checking for GDP growth required to resolve as a NO;  As a starting point, I'll assume the Global Times (GT) reported increase in military spend for 2021 is unchanged from March (2), and rather than use the GT growth for 2020, I can use the SIPRI numbers as a starting point. 2020 was a 1.7498% of GDP spend (as per data). 1.7498*1.066 / (x) = 1.7277, gives x =  7.955% GDP growth. What's made this question a little less about the numbers (for me, now that I'm checking things) is looking at a past check I completed comparing the SIPRI data to the GT numbers (3).  This confirmed for me that the GT numbers could be trusted (it's fair to assume they can report accurately when it suits).  But now, the reported SIPRI data is now showing a reduction in this metric from 2018 to 2019 (1.7395% in 2018), which contradicts the GT numbers, and adds a bunch of doubt to my position.  The target of 8% is only valid if the GT reported growth is correct, if it is closer to 1.3% (selected as the growth in the metric from 2019-2020), the above formula gives 2.56%, a number so low it was almost passed in 2020.

The latest release shows that SIPRI switched all their numbers to the new methodology, so this confirmed we will be comparing like to like, which was one reason I was at 45% instead of 50% because I initially believed this might be a tossup. If we just look at the publicly available information, China announced their 2020 military budget would grow by 6.6%. SIPRI says some of China's military spending doesn't show up in the actual budget, but for simplicity lets assume that it also grew by 6.6%. Looking at China's GDP growth, 2020 grew by 2.99% (note, I'm using reported GDP numbers at the FRED link below, not adjusted for inflation which I think is necessary since from what I can tell Chinese military spending growth announcements also are not inflation adjusted). So if we take the 2019 number of 1.7278% (which is military spending over GDP) and increase the military spending by 6.6% and the GDP by 2.99% (or in other words multiply 1.7278*1.066/1.0299) you get 1.7884, which is much larger than the 2020 number reported of 1.7498. If you assume the 2.99% GDP growth is accurate the actual 2020 spending number implies a military spending growth of only 4.3%. So in other words, without spending hours digging into the methodology I don't know if any of us can make rhyme or reason of these numbers, and in my opinion it's probably safer to default to the base rate, which shows that since 2007, for 9 out of 13 of the years (excluding 2019) military spending has been a larger share of GDP than it was in 2019. That's about 70%, so that's what I'm adjusting to.

So, the military expenditure as % of GDP is higher for low GDP growth 2020, but by only 1.27%. For me, it means practically no way for 2021 to be higher than 2019 given projected GDP growth in 2021 and official nominal growth of military budget of 6.8% (even if it is slightly different from SIPRI point of view) .

China has set the goal of a 6% increase over this number for 2021, which would be $15.582 trillion USD. Economists estimate an increase of 8.4% over 2020, which would be $15.9348 trillion USD. China has set their 2021 military budget at $202 billion USD. SIPRI explains there is a difference between the official military budget and what SIPRI includes in \"military expenditures\" (detailed here: https://www.sipri.org/databases/milex/sources-and-methods#definition-of-military-expenditure). SIPRI explains the difference is usually a 50% increase over the official military budget. 1.5 times $202 billion would be a \"goal\" of $303 billion for 2021. The \"6% increase\" GDP goal China has set would result in a mil expenditure of 1.9446%. The 8.4% increase economists have forecast would result in a mil expenditure of 1.9015%. I'm assuming the 1.5 multiple holds true for 2021. Therefore, for the 2021 mil expenditure to be greater than 2019's mil expenditure (which was 1.8886%), China's 2021 GDP would need to be greater than $16.0436 trillion USD, an increase over 2020's GDP of 9.1403%. Thus, if China overachieves its own goal of 6% GDP growth by more than 50% (to 9.14%; something I don't expect is feasible), mil expenditure as a percentage of GDP will be less than 2019's (1.8886%). Otherwise, expect this percentage to rise to between 1.9015% and 1.9446%.

However GDP growth in 2021 could be higher than in 2019 as the Chinese economy recovers from the pandemic. The risk to GDP growth is to the upside rather than downside from what we know now. I have done rough calculations based on SIRPI numbers to determine how sensitive military expenditures as a share of GDP to a 1% change in GDP. The ratio of 5 to 1, i.e. a 1% increase in GDP will reduce military expenditure as a % of GDP by 0.2%, keeping the USD number of military expenditures constant.\nIn 2019 GDP growth was 6% and if this year it will be 7% then assuming mean reversion to 1.91% of military spending to GDP, we need to adjust it lower by 0.2% to 1.89%. This is also assuming that China will stick to the same logic of military spending as they did in previous years and will not decide to boost or reduce for some geopolitical or domestic reasons. Therefore the answer then narrows down to: will China's GDP growth is going to be above or below 7% in 2021? This is a close call  at this stage.

To complicate matters further, SIPRI appears to have recently changed its methodology and the new estimates appear lower than the old ones. I've requested a clarification on how this resolves if SIPRI changes its methodology and either does or doesn't update the 2019 numbers. If it ends up comparing like vs like and SIPRI uses the new methodology for 2021 and we use revised 2019 numbers to compare I think this ends up as basically a coin flip. If they use the new methodology for 2021 but don't revise 2019 then 2021 will certainly be lower than 2019.

From the most recent year, China appears to have reached a point of optimal military spending at 250bn USD.\n/China's military spending is now constrained due to increased indebtedness on different levels of government, and a possible debt crisis, China has changed in the past few years from a major \"lender of the world\" into a big spender domestically, and a sensitive financial system with a weak shadow banking system that could collapse over a real-estate crisis in the near future.\n/China's priorities may have changed: from deterrence through military dominance towards a more moderate, trade-oriented relationship not only to its Asian-Pacific region neighbor countries, but basically towards all nations along the Belt & Road Initiative, including parts of the African continent as an important supplier of resources and a destination for major civil foreign direct investment projects, which would exchange large debt-funded infrastructure projects for the receiver nation's \"independence\". Currently, Chinese government corporations also look out for strategic investment into high tech, key technology, market leading companies, their patents and know-how.

China's persistent spending could thus be seen as a long-term effort to catch up with the U.S., although the U.S. will rather see this as a new era of arms race sparked by China.\n/between 2004 and 2019, China seems to have an average goal of 2.0% of GDP, but adapts its spending to the economic cycle also: in order to avoid negative inflationary (cost-driving) effects, the spending regularly falls behind 2.0% in an economic upswing and boom time, while in economic crises (2003-05; 2009; probably 2020 also) the Chinese government increases \"deficit spending\" on military projects contrarian to cycles, in order to keep up GDP and employment, steel, energy production etc., and preserve the long-term real estate bubble.\nOnce the crisis is over - and 2021 will prove to be such a year - and the economy is growing at a normal pace, spending tends to be cut down (or, at least, does not keep the same pace as the rest of the economy), for several reasons maybe ( see 2010-12).\n/China may also be in a strategic dilemma with armament: on the one hand, it will get ever more difficult to raise firepower without being suspicious of aggression, and due to world wide climate protection initiatives, so any major project that is outstanding, will better be completed as soon as possible, before treaties of international restrictions can interfere. On the other hand, China has an interest in being respected as a soft power that uses its resources smart also, and there may be a necessity to appease smaller countries in the region, which are afraid of aggression and too small for a withstanding army themselves.\n/China will be on the world stage with their effort to host the 2022 Winter Olympic games, and while China's reputation has suffered from their late reaction to the SARS-CoV-2 initial outbreak, and from the \"genocide\" allegations in dealing with the Xinjiang Uyghur minority, restraint in military spending could be helpful to spare them of criticism, which would likely hit home around spring 2022 for the 2021 SIPRI data, just when the 2022 Winter Olympic games should appear to be perfect. \nI suggest spending will be close to its 2019 value in absolute USD, but will come out lower at 1.81% due to budget restraint, cut-back in \"deficit spending\", and not least \"the optics\"."], [28336, "2021-02-26T21:38:05Z", [0.9], ""], [98516, "2021-02-26T20:35:04Z", [0.99], "Just eyeballing. China's spending on defense rises virtually every year, and 2020's increase was unusual in that it was much smaller than typical. The more important element will be, will a rise in GDP counteract that? And I'm going to say that no, it won't."], [14027, "2021-02-26T19:58:18Z", [0.71], "Looking at the past 20 years of data, China's military spending has been nearly constant as a percentage of GDP.  Spending increases have kept up with GDP, but not exceeded it.  Rapid GDP growth has allowed equally rapid increases in military spending. Average military spending over 20 years (2000 through 2019) has been 1.9495%, and the standard deviation (STDEVP function in Excel) is 0.094%.  That's amazingly constant.  It's possible that Emperor Xi will increase spending in preparation for invading Taiwan.  So I'll go with the crowd and overweight \"Yes.\"  But I don't think the probability is 99%, so I'll underweight vis-a-vis the crowd."], [691, "2021-02-26T19:02:33Z", [0.9], "The absolute amount will surely be larger.
