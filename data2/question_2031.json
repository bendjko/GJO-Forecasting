Current average is 170k per day which is well over the average, but there are 2 constraints to consider\n1). The number of people who can get the 2nd dose is limited by the number who had their 1st dose 8 weeks ago.  In recent weeks there has been catch up for the reduction of time between 1st and 2nd dose from 12 to 8 weeks, so numbers now and in recent past could be a little high.  If we look back 8 weeks ago from now (mid May) about 200k per day we\u2019re getting 1st doses.  So this is probably the maximum can happen\n2) summer holidays which start this week.  People may have decided to get their vaccination quickly before the hips, but now people being on holiday and having schools out may reduce who goes.  However evidence for this seems limited\n3) the number of infections and the fact that people with jabs are getting the virus, but not so badly, might be a good incentive to get the 2nd dose promptly.\n4) removal of restrictions means people can do stuff, like have normal holidays, but feeling safe and being jabbed helps with this Therefore I\u2019m going with end August, because I think everyone will go to get their 2nd dose as quickly as possible.

News of first dose vaccine is irrelevant (i am assuming people show up to their second dose). Looking at the graph \"People who have received 2nd dose vaccinations, by report date\" you can see a decline in average injections per week since the start of June.  This coincides with the decreases in first doses injected in the second half of March, ie 11-12 weeks before. So if i looks at 2nd vaccinations done in April, they started at 0.4-0.5% average per day in the first week, and reduced to about 0.2% afterwards (that makes sense as the vaccine supply was split between first and second dosers) So here is what i think. I assume that on the 25 of June (2nd doses =61.2%) we are vaccinating 1st dosers from 7 April (a gap of 11 something weeks). I add the same percentage increase to 61.2% as seen each day (day average of the previous week, too much noise in the actual daily %) in April, I calculate that we reach 80.2% on the 2nd of September (good, matches my previous forecast).  The main uncertainty is the gap of 11 something weeks between dates.\nThis is likely going to reduce as Delta variant concerns is pushing the NHS to use a shorter 8 week gap. Will they have enough vaccine supply to allow this? possible reduction in daily first doses would give more capacity for 2nd doses.\nif they use a shorter gap then adding the average daily doses in April/May is an under estimate. The date will shift earlier than 2nd of September.  I am going to change my balance of probabilities to favour August and keep watching the news.

In 65+ age bracket where the rate of increase in second doses has become almost flat (less than 1% increase in a week), there is ~4% drop between first and second dose take-up. \n- If we assume that will be static then we will need to see almost 84% of the population first dosed to get to 80% second dosed. It will probably be another week before we reach 84% first doses, which takes us to the final third of August before those additional appointments open up.\n- The second point is also demonstrably false because the we can see in the data that second doses for any given age group increase slower as time goes on.  Optimistic on timing:\n- Anyone who gets a jab before ~4th July will be eligible for their second dose in August, so we won't need to have 100% coverage of those done so far, and those that are keen enough to get the second dose ASAP will buoy the numbers. For those reasons I still do not think it's more likely that 80% will have 2 doses by end of August under the current schedule. I think it will be close, but not quite there.

UK is much less vaccine skeptical than the US - I doubt we will see 80% in the USA this year because people are being idiots. So there is a higher chance of this happening than in the USA. People also trust the government more and understand the expertise. 2. UK still suffers from skepticism and the difficulty in getting voluntary compliance with anything. Getting people in for a second dose is always going to be tough because some people feel safe with just one, it's inconvenient, and each percentage increase in vaccinated people means remaining percentage is tougher to reach. So far no drop-off has been shown. 3. Delta variant worries may prompt people to get the second jab since efficacy jumps from around 30% to 60+% with that. Again, using my frame of reference from the USA I believe this will encourage people to get the jab. Overall I see a general slowing of first doses and that means the second dose will follow. 100% guarantee that we will not have every first does person getting a second dose, so that is a good leading indicator as @kevins points out below.

Another way to look at it is that as of today (6th June) 77% of adult population have had the first dose, which means that, apart from a small dropoff between first and second doses, around 80% should have had their 2nd dose within 12 weeks.
