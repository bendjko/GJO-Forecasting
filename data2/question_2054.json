The only question is then how many will follow through with a 2nd dose in the forecast period. As vaccination uptake saturates, the lag between 1st and 2nd doses (or more precisely, the time it takes for the number of people who have had at least one dose to match the number of people who are fully vaccinated) tends to increase. In the US, it's about 78 days right now. In NZ, it's about 33 days right now.

Small countries with (semi) authoritarian regimes managed to get to 70% + first (UAE, Singapore etc), but there were some surprises like Portugal & Spain.

Yes, this rate is creeping up- I expect it to go to 2/3 million a month.

See https://bit.ly/2WdCwOR. That's one perspective. Another is the NZ government figures. On the basis that the population is 4,867,307 (https://bit.ly/381eQ2U) the country's 'official' figures suggest that 963,219 people have been fully vaccinated, i.e. ~19.8% and very similar to the above source(https://bit.ly/3mhg2HC).

While the current lockdown may encourage people to get vaccinated, https://bit.ly/2Wgux3E, can the country vaccinate 80% of the population, fully, in 4 months? More importantly, as per this question, will 3.5m, or ~ 72% of the population be fully vaccinated by 30 Dec 2021? That means 2,536,781 still need to be vaccinated in 4 months.

After some searching I found the NZ Stats agency which seems legit, the equivalent of ACS or something in the US. These numbers were much higher than the census numbers (census from 2018, this is up to date as of last fall). Nonetheless, it seems like the most accurate + up to date for this country with growing population. https://www.stats.govt.nz/information-releases/national-population-estimates-at-30-june-2021 Total population: 5,106,400\nThe only age breakdown I could find was...\n15\u201339 years\t40\u201364 years\t65 years and over\n1,745,400\t1,589,500\t819,100 Or, a total of 4,154,000 15+. Of those, NZ already has 963,219 fully vaccinated and an additional 714,594 already have 1st dose. Together, NZ needs to fully vaccinate 1,822,187 people to hit their goal.  Now, thinking about capacity...\nLast week they vaccinated ~300,000 people. Divide by two in terms of new people vaccinated and 150,000 new people were vaccinated last week. At this pace it'll take NZ just over 12 weeks to vaccinate enough people hit this milestone, which brings us to November 12th. Given the new 6 week delay they are doing between doses, that would mean we'd hit the 3.5million on December 24th. That looks good!  And... capacity is ramping up significantly. See the full page: https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-data-and-statistics/covid-19-vaccine-data#daily. Vaccinations by day is growing, number of vaccinators is growing, all trends are up and right.  If anything constrains capacity it seems like it'll be NZ's ability to acquire enough doses. They have currently used 99.5% of their stock. But they have purchase agreements for enough to cover population, and starting September 1st will be vaccinating all ages: https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-vaccines/covid-19-vaccine-strategy-planning-insights/covid-19-purchasing-vaccines. There is risk with US boosters and fight between other rich nations. This feels like the biggest risk, especially given the relatively tight window.  Vaccine hesitancy...\nIt's hard to figure out numbers of vaccine hesitant, but NZ seems to have pretty high intention to get vaccinated relative to other countries that have already started. See here: https://theconversation.com/four-in-five-new-zealanders-plan-to-get-vaccinated-but-many-people-want-more-information-about-vaccine-safety-164322. 80% already plan to get vaccinated and the definitely not is just 8% of the population.  Compared to other countries, this feels low. Social trust seems high in NZ, and the recent lockdowns seem likely if anything to make more people want it. Gut-check against other countries...\nA number of countries are already at the 70%+ level NZ would need to hit this number (Canada, Portugal, Singapore). While NZ started late they are a rich country, they are vaccinating enough now to hit it (barely) and capacity is ramping. I think this is pretty likely to hit.

In addition, NZ has been surpassing its vaccination plan and its plan shows the entire population vaccinated by November. This vaccination plan also takes into account of supply, so supply is not a bottleneck concern. The reason this percent is not higher is the difficulty in getting the last 10% of vaccinated individuals to be vaccinated. Countries with high vaccination rates like Israel have been facing difficulties getting people age 12-16 to be vaccinated. While NZ seems to be on track to reach 3.5 million people without this group of people, other countries have had a lull of vaccines as the proportion of vaccinated individuals is about 60%, which would only be about 3 million people.

If we linearly extrapolate (probably incorrect, but not too far off considering the limiting factors), it will take about 3.5 months for 3.5 million people to be fully vaccinated. If we consider the limiting factors of getting vaccinated, it is about the number of vaccines available (actual doses, vaccination sites, nurses, distance) and also the willingness to get vaccinated.  Let us compare the vaccination rate with a US state of similar size (Massachusetts). Vaccinations began around 5.5 months ago, and the rate is already at 61% for 2 dose and a 71% at 1 dose (which means it will be 71% full vaxxed very soon). Also, Massachusetts hit the 1.1 million vaccine mark 4 months ago. Considering that Massachusetts is a larger state with more people and MUCH higher population density (884 vs 47 per square mile), it should make sense for Mass to have a slower vaccination rate, meaning New Zealand's should be higher. Another thing we should consider is that since New Zealand's original COVID response who so swift and efficient, we should consider that their vaccine rollout will be smoother (also considering other nations have experience to lend). All measures point to New Zealand having better vaccine response than a similar territory that has already reached the 70% vaccination mark.

This is essentially asking whether 70% of the population in New Zealand would be fully vaccinated by the end of 2021. I think when you look at it from this perspective it becomes a different question. I think getting this much of the population is a difficult process. In the country, there are going to be lots of people who do not want to take the vaccine (or give the vaccine to their children), people who are too high risk for the vaccine, and people who are too remote to get or need the vaccine. It is important to consider what percent of the population this entails. If this is just under or above 30%, then there is almost no way that there will be 3.5 million people in New Zealand vaccinated by the end of the year. Looking at the United States, four months ago we were at 9% fully vaccinated and now we are at 47.5% vaccinated with rates starting to significantly slow down. While there are still six months left in this year, it makes it hard to believe that New Zealand will end up getting 70% of their population vaccinated by the end of the year.

Most countries now have excess doses and those are likely to start being exported to countries with lower vaccination rates.

If Switzerland can continue this trend of increasing the rate of new fully vaccinated individuals by 2.5% per month, this would result in hitting this goal by early December, which seems reasonable as most countries experience an exponential increase in vaccination rates as supply ramps up. Further support of this is the large plan the government has for increasing vaccination rates. On the governments website (https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-data-and-statistics/covid-19-vaccine-data) they have a model which estimates hitting 7 million vaccinations by October, which has been relatively spot on to date and would imply easily meeting this 3.5 million people vaccination goal. As a result, it seems likely that getting the vaccines will not be a problem for New Zealand. The biggest obstacle I see is actually attaining mass adoption beyond the 70% mark. It is worth noting that a vaccination rate of 71% is higher than any country in the world is currently at, due to most countries experience a sharp reduction in ongoing vaccination adoption. For example, in Israel, we have only seen an increase of ~ 3% in the past 3 months of fully vaccinated individuals from 62% to 65%. Even with massive vaccine availability, state wide incentives to get the vaccine, and private industry incentives, the United States only increased from 50.38% to 54.22% in the past month. This is due to many individuals hesitancy regarding the safety of the vaccine. In New Zealand this rate is estimated at 1/3. As a result, while I do think that it is more likely than not that 3.5 million people in New Zealand are fully vaccinated by the end of the year, the biggest obstacle proves to be whether they can get the last 10 to reach 71.2%"], [101286, "2021-07-02T13:13:50Z", [0.6], "After checking the rate of new vaccinations in new zealand, it seems as though 5% of the population has been vaccinated within the last month (4.2% to 9.0%).   The graph of vaccination rates is very very linear, with almost no upward convexity as of yet.  This suggests that a 5% estimate going forward is reasonable, but it may increase if vaccination availability improves.  However, as more and more people get vaccinated, you start to have selection bias where the only people left are those who are less eager to be vaccinated.  Thus, I will stick with 5% increase in vaccination per month.  New Zealand has 4.917 million people, meaning they need to have about 71% of the population vaccinated to reach 3.5 million.  Given we have just five months before December 2021, it would take a massive increase in new vaccination rates to reach this 71% (with my estimates right now, they will be closer to 35% on december 1st).  If new vaccination rates can somehow increase 2.5x to  12.5% per month, then they would be at 12.5* 5 + 9 = 71.5% vaccination rate, just barely eclipsing the 71% mark.  However, after reviewing the govt.NZ website, there are extensive plans to increase vaccination rates robustly.  Further, their estimates of vaccination rates compared to realize rates has been extremely accurate so far, making me more likely to believe their lofty predictions (https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-data-and-statistics/covid-19-vaccine-data).  Finally, their numbers for those currently vaccinated are well above other sources, and the question specifically refers to the data that is put out by the NZ ministry of health website.  Thus, I am actually starting to think that it is more likely than not that New Zealand will reach 3.5 million vaccinations before December 2021.  However, I still am skeptical of the ability to ramp up vaccinations as much as the ministry of health is suggesting.

NZ has had one of the best responses to the virus, or at least some of the lowest rates of infection, which may reduce urgency of people to get vaccinated. Presently, no nation has achieved 70% vaccination (Seychelles is the closest, I believe, at 68.4%). A big driver of this is ongoing scarcity, lack of access, and pending approval of vaccinating younger children. My assumption is by EOY, the vaccines will be approved for people of as young as 5 (possibly 2) and a wealthy, small nation like NZ will be able to procure enough doses to vaccinate their population.

Will the pace be able to double, and sustain itself, for the next six months? I am doubtful, what we have seen is an initial surge from eager recipients followed by a tapering off. The question is, at what level will this tapering off occurs when parents can have their children vaccinated?  If you look at Israel (a small, wealthy country), they have struggled to cross the 60% threshold, though 28% of their population is 0-14, and under 12s cannot yet be vaccinated, same as in the US.

It appears the only way to achieve the goal would be to aim for a 100% coverage of seniors and a vaccination rate of 90% among working-age adults, then an increasingly possible vaccination among adolescents and children by the end of 2021 would only have to contribute about 200,000 fully vaccinated to hit the target of 3.5mn overall.\nHowever, how realistic is this?

However, I doubt the new line in Singapur will deliver amounts crucial for this question, the approval of a second vaccine (J&J would be quite helpful...) was not in sight as of end of May, and increasingly not only industrialized nations but also vaccine manufacturers will feel increasing pressure to prioritize deliveries into developing economies of Latin America, Asia and Africa where the pandemic is worst at the moment and where the availability of additional doses of vaccines could basically make a difference between life and death for many. It is thus well in the realm of possible that New Zealand with its low incidence will either voluntarily or involuntarily will forego some of their near-term BioNTech/Pfizer supplies for the sake of international vaccination efforts (CoVax campaign).
