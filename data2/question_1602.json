(https://www.fox8live.com/2020/04/24/la-dept-health-cases-covid-deaths-reported/) . (I count) 13 remaining days (of data) for this question (4/27-5/9/20). An average of 25.4 deaths per day for this upcoming period will equal 2000 deaths as of 5/9.  Over the most recent 11-day period Louisiana has averaged approx. 51.5 deaths/day, with a range of 26 to 77 per day. (https://covidtracking.com/data/state/louisiana). It seems that a significant downward trend in (recent) daily deaths will need to occur to avoid exceeding 2000 deaths over the remaining time period. At the recent, simple avg. rate indicated above, approx. 670 more deaths may occur by 5/9/20 (holding other factors and influences).
