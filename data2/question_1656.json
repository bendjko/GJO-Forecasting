No country with negative rates can rule the economic world. I doubt US will risk his crown. On the other hand an inflationary shock should force FOMC to higher rates. I doubt will be the case in such a short period of time. Even if it happens, FED will react very slowly and cautionary.

The past four recessions (July 1981-December 1982, July 1991-February 1992, April-October 2001, December 2007-July 2009) have all coincided with steep rate cuts to soften the blow to the economy. The difference being in this scenario that there is no further to cut, at least not with having negative rates. [1] But the US has never had negative rates in comparison to Europe. The difference being that historically the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan have struggled with structural issues making it difficult to generate growth. [2] This should give us a solid indication that it is unlikely the Fed will allow rates to dip below zero. Time of writing, they sit at 0.05%.  On the other hand, Assistant Vice President of the St Louis Fed Yi Wen warns that a massive quantitative easing program may not be enough to facilitate a V-shaped recovery. He goes on to suggest negative interest rates among other policy tools may be the solution. [3] However, despite rallies in the stock market and typical CNBC guff that retail traders 'nailed the bottom' hopes of a V-shaped recovery are fading quickly. [4] Bloomberg reported last week that a second wave is emerging in the US and should this be the case it is unlikely that a rate cut will have much of an impact as the economic shutdown clock resets. [5] While a second lockdown phase is unlikely the damage will already be done. In the midst of all this, Chairman Powell has doubled down on his refusal to let rates go negative, seemingly preferring a QE-based strategy. The evidence, he says, just doesn't support them being an effective tool. A position on which all 17 FOMC members are agreed.[6] In sum, I'm not ruling out Powell having to climb down and cut rates but I think it's very unlikely. I also don't see any legitimate reason for the Fed to raise rates at this point unless it wants to watch the world implode. Rates will stay as they are barring an unforeseen developments. Please comment any critiques below. I would be delighted to hear them.
