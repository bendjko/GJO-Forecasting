The situation is complicated as EHRC prioritized an application about this case [and, indeed, is moving quite fast]. The next court session was rescheduled for ~9th of June because of that. Speaking of fraud charges:\n* There are no court sessions scheduled for this one yet. \n* This might be just an intimidation tactic to add pressure. This might be just showing off to a boss.\n* Meduza writes [2] about a money laundering case, which hasn't resulted in a conviction but led to an arrest of a yearly budget worth of funds and other troubles.\n>  In 2019, the Russian authorities opened a money laundering case against FBK\u2019s employees. The investigation emerged amid the mass protests in Moscow in support of the independent candidates who were barred from running for city council. According to state investigators, the FBK\u2019s employees deposited funds into the foundation\u2019s accounts that they knew had been \u201cacquired for them through criminal means.\u201d Initially, the case involved a sum of around one billion rubles ($13.2 million by today\u2019s exchange rate), though this figure later dropped to 75 million rubles ($990,000). Law enforcement officials carried out searches at \u201cTeam Navalny\u201d offices across the country repeatedly, and many of the FBK\u2019s employees had their bank accounts frozen. The investigation dragged on for more than a year and a half without any charges being laid.  I previously was around 8% based on \"ugh, someone might want to show off, or people at Security Council might get pissed off and do it kinda randomly.\" I am not forecasting a time it would take for a reasonable trial to convict them \u2014 I am forecasting you-know-who getting annoyed by Smart Voting, Navalny, EHRC, &c.

If this degradation of health is due to an inside knowledge that another conviction is looming, then this question may resolve in yes. However, COVID-19 and prisons do not fare well together. Also, if opposition is successful in freeing or at least lessening Navalny's sentence and prison treatment, they may slap on the charges as a countermove. \"The Kremlin said it was not following developments with Navalny's health, which it said was a matter for prison authorities.\" This line could mean as of right now, the government does not care. They did their job to carry a trial which resulted in a conviction. Are they on the sidelines working to come up with a second conviction? \"Belozertsev was ordered to two months of pre-trial detention Monday.\" Another high-profile Russian was arrested for bribery and he was ordered 2 months in pre-trial custody. Whether or not Navalny is currently in a pre-trial custody period or whether the courts have enough room to accomodate both these cases, and more, remains to be discussed. In my view, they have enough employees and resources (Wikipedia), perhaps even enough time to process the Navalny case. However, what makes sense to me is that they will order Navalny back to pre-trial detention. If they did this tomorrow, it still will take time for a trial to occur.

The second question is basically a freebie, 100% yes. It's a show trial and he's been tried and convicted for similar crimes twice before, and the acquittal rate in Russian criminal trials is hilariously low, 0.25% as of 2019 (https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russia-justice-system-low-acquittal-rate-uk-crown-court-a8935016.html). Previous cases seem to have been geared towards discrediting him and having the conviction bar him from running for public offices, both of which the Kremlin would still have an interest in. If a ruling is brought, it's unlikely that it would be to acquit an enemy of the state for crimes similar to ones he's already been convicted of, especially when acquittal is absurdly rare in trials in general. The practice that the Russian legal system seems to prefer to acquittals is suspension of prison sentences (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspended_sentence#Russia) like Navalny received in his previous cases. If charges are brought it's almost certain that they'll result in a conviction, with any mitigation done through a sentence suspension. Most of this hinges on whether the charges will come at all, and if they do whether they and a trial will come before the deadline. Charges haven't technically even been brought yet, only a criminal probe opened. Navalny has a couple cases as possible reference points for time from charge to verdict too. In the 2012 Kirovles case, charges were brought on July 30, 2012, and the trial was on April 17 2013, 8.5 months later. In the Yves Rocher case, the initial claim was filed December 14 2012, charges brought October 29 2013, and Navalny (and his brother) were sentenced on December 30 2014, a gap of 14 months between charges and sentencing. This is another investigation for financial crimes, so I\u2019d imagine the time from charges to trial should be somewhere in that range. A very quick/rushed trial wouldn\u2019t align well with how Russia has treated Navalny thus far. Russia has at least been pretending to follow the law this whole time, like they didn\u2019t stop his plane from exiting the country to Germany, and his past trials were procedurally normal, but there\u2019s no guarantee that that will continue considering how high-profile the case is. However, if they want to jail him, they have the option of reinstating his suspended prison sentence from 2014 for violation of parole, which they\u2019re currently in the process of doing. If they want to bring charges before the next parliamentary election, they can focus on the foreign agent and defamation of a WWII veteran narratives that have more emotional punch. They don\u2019t need new charges to be brought, much less a formal conviction to come. According to Navalny they\u2019ve already seized his and his orgs\u2019 bank accounts, presumably outwardly justified by the fraud investigation, so they probably don\u2019t need to step that up. The argument in favor of conviction before the deadline is that they\u2019ll want to convict him of more crimes to discredit him before the parliamentary elections coming up in September, similar to how they\u2019ve brought charges before elections in the past. Financial crimes, especially ones similar to what he accuses other politicians of, could be more \u201cnormal\u201d charges to complement the more emotional/outlandish foreign agent and defamation charges. They could rationalize the very quick timeline by saying the crimes were so obvious they didn\u2019t need more time to investigate, and the trial was expedited because he\u2019s a threat to the public. In the past Putin has refused to even say his name to avoid giving him publicity, but that has definitely changed recently with state media bashing him constantly. Acting swiftly and deviating from past procedure could serve to intimidate others as well, which the Kremlin clearly wants to do, by showing that they won\u2019t be bound by their typical standards in squashing dissent like this. He\u2019s already been barred from running on past convictions, but adding a fundraising fraud conviction could further justify that decision as well. Alternatively, this could be a way of targeting his non-profit orgs and restricting their activities, by painting them as a piggy bank for a criminal currently in prison. The weakness of those arguments is that they could achieve most of the same goals by simply bringing charges, not convicting. They can \u201clegally\u201d keep him imprisoned on other charges as they are now, or keep him imprisoned for the fraud charges for up to a year after charges are brought. The can support the bar on running based on the fraud charges or the ongoing associated investigation, if he\u2019s somehow out of prison come election season. They can target his non-profit orgs by labelling them as foreign agents, which they\u2019ve already done in order to restrict their activities, and can presumably seize their assets as part of an investigation, which Navalny claims they\u2019ve already done as well. If the Kremlin is still trying to appear outwardly fair and just like they have in the past, then rushing a trial would also risk looking corrupt. Depending on procedure it may also give Navalny a platform, which he\u2019s been good with in the past, notably asking the judge if she has any recipes for pickled gherkins since discussing the law is pointless. Denying him the right to speak in his trial would again risk looking corrupt. Another possibility that is important to consider is if Navalny dies in the meantime. This is the more extreme intimidation option the Kremlin could consider, and they\u2019ve already tried a couple months ago. Russia can do posthumous trials like they did for Magnitsky, but the trial would almost certainly come much later than August of this year. Magnitsky\u2019s posthumous trial came more than two years after his death, presumably because doing a trial right after his death would\u2019ve made the case look much worse. If he dies the chance of a trial coming for these charges is very very low. Overall, a lot would need to fall into place for a conviction on these charges to come this soon. They need to bring charges and do a trial all within a very short time frame, and the closer we get to the deadline the lower the chance that charges will result in a trial by the deadline. If we reach May or June with no charges the chance would probably be near zero. Rushing a trial on these charges would deviate from past behavior in a way that isn\u2019t optimal for most ends as far as I can see.

Navalny has become a high-profile personality and perhaps a further fraud case brought at  this time would perhaps result in further demonstrations and comment in the foreign press.\nUsing Khodorkovsky as an example, a further fraud case would make sense when the publicity dies down and the demonstrations exhaust themselves in the next two or two and half years prior to his release on the initial prison sentence.\nAmnesty International have probably diminished Navalny\u2019s case by downgrading his status form one of \u2018prisoner of conscience\u2019 due to his anti-migrant racist comments made some ten years ago. https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9301393/Alexei-Navalny-moved-penal-colony-Moscow-jail-serve-two-year-prison-term.html  https://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/alexeinavalny/video-2363464/Video-Amnesty-International-chief-harm-good.html  https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9300163/Amnesty-chiefs-admit-undermining-Navalny-stripping-prisoner-conscience-status.html  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/24/alexei-navalny-loses-amnesty-prisoner-of-conscience-label  https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/02/aleksei-navalny-prisoner-of-conscience/  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/23/alexei-navalny-discharged-german-hospital-treatment-novichok-poisoning  https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-53865811  https://www.dw.com/en/putin-says-he-allowed-alexei-navalny-to-be-treated-in-germany/a-55366299  https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-12082222  https://www.dw.com/en/russia-opens-new-criminal-probe-against-alexei-navalny/a-56088559  https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/02/18/why-the-kremlins-anti-navalny-strategy-just-might-work-a72998\n"], [94556, "2021-02-26T13:52:23Z", [0.88], ""], [97959, "2021-02-26T13:35:18Z", [0.75], "Always hard to say. \nIn the past, Putin has been very keen to isolate and neutralise his opposition.

My gut tells me better to keep him and his supporters muzzled by leaving the charges hanging, rather than whip up more international headlines and domestic protest by being seen to kick him while he's down.

Adjust down to 5 for being presumably a wealthy urbanite with good diet and medical care (until recently...), up to 10 per thousand for having recently recovered from a novichok poisoning, 12 for prison conditions (diet, violence). Leaving out Covid as death rate so low in his age group. So a 1.2% chance of 'natural' death over a year; halved to 0.6% as we only have 6 months to the deadline, plus 15% state kills him. Total chance of death 15.6%; so let's call that 84.4% chance of being alive, for the maths. 84.4% x 33% = 28% I don't think previous timings matter as Russia can do charge to conviction in years or minutes, as it pleases.
