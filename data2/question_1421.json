More or less, corporate share buybacks are soppig up liquidity. Earnings are going down, but earnings per share are going up, because capital is being sopped up in buying up shares.  We are rearranging the chairs on the titanic, again.  Locking up capital (non-productively) in shares, means that ever increasing amounts of profits will be spent paying back debt.

I think near-zero or zero rates are here for the long-term. Within the scope of the question, I do not see the rate going higher.  Could it go lower? Possibly, but against that is the market slump today: the Fed is in that unenviable position in which actions taken to stimulate the economy simply add to the panic. At this point, any Fed action will be action for the sake of action, but recovery demands a massive, massive shock-and-awe stimulus package as well as a plan to deal with Covid-19 that is credible. Clearly, neither markets nor businesses at large believe that Covid-19 is going away anytime soon. Furthermore, the kind of anti-Covid-19 measures that have worked in China, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, etc, are measures that the UK and US are unwilling to undertake, I suspect from fear of the disruptions it would cause and the cost such measures would involve.  I suspect this is a 2-year Covid-crisis and fresh thinking is needed. Fiddling with rates is no longer effective.

There is talk of the Federal Reserve possibly taking the rate into negative territory with futures markets predicting a 26% probability of this occurring by the end of December 2020 [2]. This has never happened in the history of the Federal Reserve and seems unlikely to happen both in the near future and in the longer term. There would need to be a drastic change in the status of the economy for the fed to really consider negative interest rates, in my personal assessment. EDIT - Jerome Powell just made a statement that the Federal Reserve doesn't see negative interest rates as \"appropriate policy\" for the United States [4]. This currently means the Federal Reserve is unwilling to drop their federal fund rates below the current rate band of 0-0.25. Many large businesses have decided to shut their doors for the next 2-6 weeks. Due to a lack of economic data that will be collected between the end of March and 28-29 April, it is unlikely that the  Federal Fund rate will be taken into negative territory. It is more likely that the Federal Reserve will re-institute Quantitative Easing measures it last used in 2008, such as guaranteeing to keep the rate at 0% and purchasing more bonds [3]. However, many individuals are questioning whether there is much more the Federal Reserve can do to stabilize the economy without decisive action taken by the Federal Government [3]. I assess that the Federal Reserve will cut the federal fund interest rate to the 0-0.25 band during their March meeting (among other measures) and will re-affirm their commitment to the 0 rate band in the April meeting. Thus, I assess a 100% probability that at the close of business on 29 April 2020, the upper limit of the Federal Reserve's target range for the federal funds rate will be the same as it was at the close of business on 18 March 2020: 0-0.25.

The question is, will rates be further cut at the April FOMC meeting? South Korea can be used as a case study to analyze how a democratic, wealthy country deals with COVID-19. On February 22 South Korea recorded its first day of >200 daily infections. It took until March 9th, 17 days, for daily infections to fall under 200 cases. The US recorded its first day with >200 daily infections on March 9th. Considering the US is struggling to produce test kits and have tested only 4,385 people (0.001% of the population) according to the Atlantic as of March 9th. South Korea is testing 15,000 people a day for a total of around 200,000 (almost .5% of the population). I expect that it takes the US longer than 17 days to reduce new cases under 200 meaning that the rapid spread COVID-19 will continue into April in the US.

One interesting aspect of this: \nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-a-supply-shock-is-biggest-stock-market-worry-as-viral-outbreak-continues-2020-02-25 In a nutshell: a demand shock can be addressed with monetary or fiscal policy. However supply shocks can cause a spike in inflation and are not easily managed with monetary and fiscal policy. The macro picture will depend on the composite of a bunch of individual but connected markets (plastics, glass, electronic components, cars, phones, etc). If demand drops more than supply, which seems possible over the next few months, then prices could spike for individual items and it's unclear to me what the aggregate effect would be. But one possibility is higher inflation.  A spike in inflation that was believed to be short term (<1 year) would mean:\n1) suddenly negative short-term real interest rates, putting downward pressure on short term bill prices / upward pressure on nominal rates\n2) lower long-term interest rates\n3) risks to those US financial institutions that aren't prepared for that combination of factors => systemic risks to other banks I guess in that situation the Fed would need to provide direct funding to US institutions to keep them onsides with their liquidity and capital ratio limits. That would hammer the financial sector of the stock market. \nThe supply and demand shocks would hammer many brick and mortar businesses. \nTravel, leisure and hospitality are already hammered but with lots more room to drop  That could all happen pretty fast (2-3 months) if this supply disruption continues. It would appear that:\n1) life is on track to return to the new normal in China; however, when they start relaxing their controls will COVID come raging back? If so then we have a problem. We should get early indications on that in the coming weeks and I think that's part of why the market reacted so harshly to a relatively minor uptick in Wuhan cases today;\n2) Outside of China supply disruption hasn't really kicked in yet.

The recent downturn in the November jobs report (down 561,000, lowest since Feb '18), contractions in the retail, construction, and manufacturing markets, financial challenges with major corporations like Boeing and General Electric, and concerns over the long-term stability of the US-China phase I trade deal - in an ongoing trade war - there is a strong probability the US economy may contract in the next 6-12 months despite a strong stock market.
