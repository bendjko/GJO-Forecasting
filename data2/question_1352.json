Here is a link on how to calculate it (https://www.thoughtco.com/probability-union-of-three-sets-more-3126263). Doing it for 15 periods is quite tedious, but you do get convergence with really low probabilities. I found that if you assume the probability of inflation reaching or exceeding 2% in any given month is only 1%, then you\u2019d assign a 13% probability for it happening in any one of the next 15 months.  Over the past 10 years inflation has reached or exceeded 2% in 25% of the months. The most recent time it occurred was October, 2018. As a result, my base rate for any given month is 25%. From there, the factors I mentioned in previous posts give me pause on the long-terms strength of the EU economy and the CBs ability to generate inflation. Even if I assume a 5% chance of inflation meeting or exceeding 2% in any given month, my probability that the same condition will be met at least once between now and Dec, 2020 is 45%.
