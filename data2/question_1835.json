Case growth in this region is currently overwhelmingly driven by India. Maharashtra, which has more cases/day than any other state, won't make a decision about whether to impose a lockdown until after April 14, and even then, they will give people \"enough time to prepare before lockdown is imposed.\" Meanwhile, migrant workers are leaving Maharashtra and going all over the country, potentially seeding new outbreaks. In addition, 30 to 50 million people from all over India are expected to attend the Kumbh Mela Hindu festival that started yesterday and is occurring over the coming month at the Ganges River at Haridwar. It's largely outdoors, but there are still plenty of opportunities for the virus to spread indoors related to this festival.  If Maharashtra imposed a serious lockdown immediately on April 15, reaching 20M cases could possibly be averted, but barely. But if Maharashtra waits a week until, say, April 22, given that it takes people who are infected an average of 5 or 6 days to develop symptoms, then I don't see how 20M will be avoided. Moreover, Maharashtra recorded 63k cases today, while India as a whole recorded 169k; Maharashtra only accounts for 37% of India's cases. I don't see the sorts of lockdowns occurring in other locations that would be needed to slow this train down before April 30. On the current trajectory, 20M cases will be reached several days before the end of this month (approx. April 25 or 26, in 13 or 14 days from now).

I'm excluding the Philippines now, as I had erroneously included it; thanks to @SE_Meyer for pointing this out. Then these other countries are likely to contribute at most 0.2M additional cases to the total by the end of April. I'll count on 0.1M.\nThen need 5.3M more cases to get to 20M by April 30.\nIt's a very tight forecast, but assuming growth continues unabated, India and Bangladesh will together contribute about 5.7M additional cases by April 30, so that SE Asia will get to 20M cases by April 30. \nI don't see any significant reason why growth will slow down. However, if growth appears to slow down at some point, this forecast will need to be updated. ***** Cases in WHO Southeast Asia region are currently at 14.6M and are dominated by India, with contributions from the Philippines, Indonesia and, increasingly, Bangladesh. The Philippines may be able to reverse its rise in cases/day; Indonesia may soon see a rise in cases/day. I suspect Bangladesh is likely to see an ongoing increase, and potentially an explosion in cases. It's not clear to me whether India will be able to control the growth in cases/day because of pandemic fatigue and the rise of variants; many may be coming to accept one more infectious disease, in a country in which infectious diseases continue to cause an enormous disease burden. In short, I don't see case growth in India or Bangladesh slowing down appreciably in the near term, but the growth in cases in some other countries, such as the Philippines, might be more likely to slow.  5.4M cases more to get to 20M.\nSuppose countries beside India and Bangladesh contribute, conservatively, 0.5M to 1M cases by April 30. \nThen need ~4.5 to 5M from India and Bangladesh in 33 days, or average 136k/day to 152k/day.  Currently, India at 53.2k/day, Bangladesh at 3.3k/day, with doubling times of ~12 and ~9 days, respectively.\nProjecting exponential growth in cases/day for India and Bangladesh separately, they will add 5.7M or 38.7M cases by April 30 or May 31, respectively.\nSo, I think it's possible that the region will reach 20M cases by April 30. It all depends on whether the numbers of cases/day in these countries continue to grow exponentially and at least as quickly as they are now. And it's not clear to me what will slow them down. Seasonality might a bit.

If cases averaged double or 100,000 a day starting now they would hit 20 million in late February. But that's a pretty significant jump and assumes an instant doubling, so I think February is unlikely. I lean a little bit toward them not reaching 20 million in the timeframe."], [96872, "2020-11-11T11:27:38Z", [0.02, 0.48, 0.47, 0.03, 0.0], "South East Asia currently has about 9.7 million confirmed cases. The rate of infection is slowly dropping but I'd anticipate an increase over public holidays, especially the different New Year celebrations (January and February). With Christmas being the end of December, we might get more infections in the final week of 2020, but I don't think a high percentage of new infections will be confirmed over Christmas. Many governments may also want to report the figures later to not appear like a spike took place over any celebrations, so as to spare the short term economic shock of cancelling celebrations.
