South Korea is more dependent on China, so the effects may be more pronounced there. Fed cuts will increase the incentive to hold South Korean currency relative to the dollar. Although, South Korea may also cut rates in response to similar pressures. The US Current Account Balance is strengthening and the South Korean Current Account Balance is decreasing which will drive USD appreciation (i.e. more won per dollar). Further, continued concerns about global growth will increase demand for the USD to hold haven assets. Looking back historically, the only time since the GFC that the KRWUSD rate got close to 1,250 (1,248) was during 2016 amid concerns about a global growth slowdown. The only times it jumped above 1,300 were the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, the dotcom bubble, and the GFC. I'm discounting the probability of similar financial disasters happening before July 15.
