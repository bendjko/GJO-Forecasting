I forecast this outcome based on an analysis of each team's percentile rankings in offensive passing and rushing, defensive passing and rushing, total downs given and gained, total turnovers, weather, time zone, and any additional information. With this being our first forecast I am unsure of how detailed my description should be. My decision comes down to a few points:     The Chiefs' rushing defense (bottom 22%) will struggle to contain the Titans' league-leading running back Derrick Henry and the rushing offense (top 9%)\n    Titans' passing defense (bottom 41%) will struggle to contain the Chiefs' Patrick Mahomes and the passing offense (top 15%)\n    However, the Chiefs' overall defensive ranking lands dead-smack in the middle of the NFL at 50% as opposed to the Titans' overall (bottom) 37.5%; Chiefs' overall offensive ranking (top 19%) outranks the Titans' overall offense (top 37.5%)\n    The Chiefs' overall productivity in gaining downs (top 19%) vastly outperforms the Titans' (50%), which should translate into more offensive efficiency in moving the ball down the field; neither team performs in the top 50% of downs allowed (I did not weigh this as a significant advantage/disadvantage)\n    Total turnovers were considered to be a negligible factor: the Chiefs' possess an overall +8 turnovers rating as opposed to the Titans' +6\n    Weather: The weather in Kansas City is forecast to be a high of 29*F/low of 16*F with a 0% chance of precipitation (mostly cloudy). I considered this to be essentially a non-factor. Neither team possesses an advantage in this weather but it does not hinder either team's performance offensively or defensively.\n    Perhaps most importantly, the Chiefs possess home field advantage, a phenomenon which has been found to be a factor in contests of sport (the NFL is 2nd only to the NBA; https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-nfls-home-field-advantage-is-real-but-why/). The Chiefs currently/allegedly possess the claim to fame of having the loudest environment in any given game with 142.2 decibels - something that is sure to complicate opposing defensive and offensive playcalling Overall, I forecast that the Chiefs have a 70% chance to win the AFC Championship over the Titans (30%).
