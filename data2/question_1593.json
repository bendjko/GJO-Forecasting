COVID Project did not delay their 4PM count to wait for late reporters (which they say they might choose to do on their website). They CHANGED the number by around 8K AFTER reporting it.  We should use a more reliable and professional source for the COVID questions, like Our World In Data. https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus, which gets their numbers from the EU. This change made most of my commentary below pointless. Another comment on the question. This is a frustrating question because of the format. It would have been easy from the beginning to project with 90% + certainty a narrow band that included the correct outcome. Picking from the fixed bins made this much harder, and also less useful as an exercise. In the real world you would make a point forecast with error bands most of the time. So why did I change my estimate after yesterday's very low new case figure, which argues strongly for under 750,000?  One reason is that yesterday was misleading. NY didn't get its estimate into the Covid Project estimate and it usually does.  It will be in today's estimate instead, and if they report today's figure early tomorrow, there will be 3 NY estimates in the count for the last 2 days. That would add 7K to the final result offsetting yesterday's low number. The other reason is that, in general, Worldometer is a leading indicator for Covid Project, since it doesn't cut off around 4PM. Worldometer's daily count is higher for yesterday is higher than any other day since April 9. This means that even though today is a Saturday, it WILL be a big day, because Covid Project's estimate had yesterday as one of the lowest recent estimates. They have a lot of ground to make up. Their total after today will be at least 720,000. Leaving only 30K for Sunday. In the end, it will come down to the Sunday count. I still expect Sunday to be light based on day-of-week  cyclicality, but it's much less certain than the numbers suggest today. And finally, I decided to try to make a \"good\" prediction rather than a winning prediction.

So I bring [800k, 850k] down from 10% to 2%. Seems all but impossible now that the next two days in a row will be >7% growth. The uncertainty here is coming from the \"human dimension\": measurement issues, unknown backlogs, etc --- not from the numbers. Now even if we assume linear growth, we'd need < 27.8k / day to not break 750k. Absolute growth this low has only happened twice in the last 2 weeks, or 1/7 chance. To get it two days in a row is a 2% chance. And I don't think growth looks linear quite yet. To get a little more quantitative, if we fit a linear function to the past 7 days on WolframAlpha [1], we get a daily growth of ~28.3k/day as the best fit and a prediction of 751.2k for 19 April. And if we fit an exponential function on those 7 days, we get a prediction of 762.9k for 19 April [2]. (Btw, the exponential fit is better: R^2 is 0.998 for linear, and 0.999995 for exponential.) Again due to \"human dimension\" uncertainties I'm not going to go like 90% in the (750k,800k) bucket. But ~75% does seem justified.

Seems clear that tests were still rolling out. Lots of noise. Big growth but trending downward over this period. 29 March -- 04 April\nGrowth trending steadily downward from ~16% to ~12%. 05 April -- 10 April\nDaily growth kind of constant around 8%. 11 April -- 15 April\nGrowth trending downward from ~6% to ~4.5%. Specifically, there are sizeable jumps at the boundaries I chose, could be noise, or could be (2 weeks after) when various places went into lockdown. For instance, NY went into lockdown on 20 March, that plus two weeks is 3 April, near the second breakpoint. About a week ago, 95% of Americans were under some kind of lockdown [1]. So I think that for the next 4 days we will not see a big surprise jump up in daily growth. So I am comfortable ruling out buckets 4-7. On the other hand daily growth is not going to halve in the next 4 days either, so I rule out bucket 0. The (log-)average daily growth in last 5 days (last period) is 5%, so bucket 2 seems most likely, as 4 days is not very long. But the result will be closer to the 1/2 boundary than the 2/3 boundary. I feel ~20% for bucket 3 and even split for buckets 1/2 is about right.

I then average the last three days of April 19th projections to establish a my official mean count. I do this to smooth out potential growth rate volatility from one day to the next. To find the probabilities for each bin, I then set a max upward bound of the difference of the projected mean and the latest count. For example, yesterday's projection shows a mean of 777,632 U.S. cases by April 19th. After subtracting today's count 551,826) and adding to the mean, the upper bound then is 1,003,437 cases. Upper and lower bounds should be ~4 standard deviations (covering 99.994% [5] of the normal distribution). I make a small adjustment to the upper bound to expand it based on the variance between the last three days of projection to account for amount of uncertainty. Because I'm taking the difference between projected mean and today's count, this standard deviation will naturally narrow as we get closer to the forecast close date, honing in on a particular bin. I then calculate probabilities for bins based on the mean and those standard deviations. I'll update my model and forecast daily.
