While the size of relief is up for debate, policy makers have expressed a bipartisan consensus that some relief is needed, with very few dissenters. Regarding (2), while Democratic legislation includes well over $100 billion for states and local governments, Republican legislation includes close to none. A more recent $1.3 trillion plan has been discussed, but the details are still private. Given that the original CARES act included over $300 billion for states and local governments, I put the probability of (2) at 70%. Regarding (3), the federal fiscal year ends on September 30th.

There's a lot of contention, and both sides don't seem keen on crossing the aisle to compromise. I'm currently at 4%, since we'll see what Congress focuses on tomorrow/this week, but I think the probability of a result within the next two weeks is quite slim.

However, for a sense of scale, @dzhou3 makes a couple of good points; first, that there have been bills proposed with aid greater than $500 billion, and second, that there is a precedent for aid of ~ $100 billion in 2009. However, recent precedent shows that it is difficult for congress to agree on anything, and this will only be exacerbated as the presidential election nears. According to https://en.as.com/en/2020/09/06/latest_news/1599395953_296991.html congress has recently cycled through two proposed bills \u2013 one by Democrats and one by Republicans \u2013 neither of which has passed.

Since there could be more than one bill introduced, I increase this probability to 45%, which is between 33% and the probability of one bill passing if there are 2 bills introduced (33% + 33% - 33%^2 = 55%). I do think that if a bill passes, it is likely to be at least $100 billion, since both parties agree that significant aid is needed, and the economic environment is similar to that in 2009. I put the probability of aid of at least this amount, conditional on some form of aid passing, at 90%. Beyond a bill getting passed, we need to consider the timeframe. This aid is urgently needed, so it's reasonable that it will be passed within the next couple months, if it is passed at all. September 22 is 15 days away, i.e., half a month.

Just today, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows indicated that \"the Trump administration is sticking firm with its $1.3 trillion offer as talks with Democratic leadership remain at an impasse\" [2]. However, I do think a deal will eventually be reached and that it will almost certainly be combined with a yearly government funding package.  But note that Congress usually waits until the last minute to make deals. Given that 22 September is over a week before the end of the fiscal year on 30 September, I don't think a deal is likely in the time frame of this question.
