There appears to have been 0 deaths resulting from anti-government protests since the 1997 handover of HK from Britain to China, as @KitsonJ has pointed out. However, as many others have noted, there is good reason to give little weight to this base rate given how enormous this protest movement is and how great of a threat it is perceived to be by Beijing, especially relative to past protest movements in HK. So instead, I will mostly consider the base rate to be the fatalities/near-fatalities thus far in this current protest movement. The ongoing protest movement has gone on for 196 days, and the protests have been violent since July 1 (when protestors stormed the Legislative Council Complex), for a total of 104 days so far [1]. There are 79 days from now until Dec. 31. In the previous 196 days, there have been 0 fatalities as a result of the protests and, for my purposes, 2 near-fatalities. One of these near-fatalities was the use of a live round against a protestor on the 70th anniversary of the founding of Communist China [2], resulting in a chest injury. The other was the use of a \"sharp object\" by a protestor against a police officer, resulting in a \"bleeding neck wound\" [3]. Neither of these incidents seem to have been life-threatening, but I count them as near-fatalities because a slight variation in where the bullet hit in the first case and how deep the stabbing wound was in the second case could have made these situations life-threatening. Please let me know if there have been other altercations that could have been similarly life-threatening in slightly different circumstances. So, there have been 0 fatalities and 2 near-fatalities in the 196 days of the protest movement and 104 days since the protests became violent with the storming of the Legislative Council Complex. This includes the time around and on the day of the especially sensitive 70th anniversary of the founding of Communist China on and around Oct. 1 - to my knowledge, there are no similarly sensitive anniversary dates looming between now and the end of the year. Given this base rate, I find it very unlikely that there will be at least three protest-related fatalities if things continue as they have been - perhaps just ~5% (the moment a first fatality ever occurs, I will revise this upward to 20%). I think the most likely scenario that would result in at least three fatalities is a 1989 Tiananmen Square-style crackdown. According to most experts, the next 79 days of the year will most likely feature Beijing playing a waiting game in which they hope that the protest movement will die off on its own. Experts do not expect Beijing to either give in to the protester's demands nor to embark on a 1989 Tiananmen Square-style crackdown (such a crackdown would almost certainly result in at least three fatalities). I think Evan Osnos, who reports on China for The New Yorker, puts Beijing's strategic thinking best: \"I would not expect that they're going to give into the protestor's demands, frankly there is no indication in Bejing...(that) China is ready to make a deal with HK...but at the same time, there are very real pressures on Xi Jinping to not handle this the way it was handled in 1989...if they went into HK with tanks...this would devastate a financial capital that is very important to China's economy...and more importantly, it would devastate China's effort to establish itself on the global stage as an alternative to American leadership. The more likely scenario is that China would keep up the pressure and would gradually use its sheer weight and persistence to grind down the resistance of protestors in HK\" [4]. Moreover, according to other experts, \"armed intervention in Hong Kong would also provide political leverage for Xi's factional opponents\" and \"Xi will also be thinking of cross-strait relations with Taiwan, which have only worsened since the Hong Kong protests began in June.\" [5] But on the other hand, this has gone on for long enough that some experts think that Bejing's patience may be running out and that the situation will at some point involve intervention by the People's Armed Police [6,7]. Veterans of the Tiananmen see such a crackdown as inevitable [8]. If the waiting game does not work out, Beijing may be forced to intervene. I assign such a crackdown by the mainland before the end of a year a probability of ~25%. I assume this will, in all cases, result in at least 3 fatalities.  TL;DR: 5% chance of 3+ fatalities if protests continue as they have been + 25% chance of a 1989-style crackdown that will result in 3+ fatalities in nearly all cases = 30% of 3+ fatalities.

Background: Hong Kong was ceded to Britain in 1842 and has been a British colony until 1997 when it was handed back to China.  As residents in a colony, Hong Kongers did not have much say in the colonial government.  In anticipation of the handover, UK gradually transferred its administration to local control.  The \u201cBasic Law\u201d negotiated between UK and China became the mini-constitution for the governance of HK.  China declared the use of \u201cone country, two systems\u201d in the management of HK for the next 50 years. The optimistic assumption (by UK and Hong Kongers) is that over time China will liberalize its political system as it grows economically, which makes it easy to integrate HK into China by 2047.     In the twenty plus years since the handover, China becomes an economic power.  But while loosening its grip on its citizens on some matters, it maintains strict controls of all things political.  It maintains the infamous internet \u201cGreat China Wall\u201d which blocks anything that the Chinese government considered objectionable.  Hong Kongers just have to step over the border to Shenzhen to experience the differences.   Recent events indicate that China is becoming more totalitarian instead of liberalizing.  Several Hong Kongers have disappeared (i.e. kidnapped) into China to face politically related chargers.  This creates fear in HK, especially the young people.  Think of it this way, if you are a twenty-something, you and your family are likely to lose a lot of your freedom when you are in your forties.  There is not much hope for them if the system does not change now. This is the reason why the young people are taking the matter in their own hands and protesting now, with the hope of changing the trajectory of history. Past protests in HK: There were unrests in HK in the pre-handover days.  Most of the unrests died down with no casualties.  However, the unrest in 1967, which lasted several months, resulted in more than 50 deaths [1].  This unrest started with a labor dispute. It grew bigger as it got inspiration from the Cultural Revolution in China at that time.  Bombs and clashes between the police and protesters resulted in the 50-plus casualties.  The 1967 unrest is a reminder that loss of life in unrests in HK could and did happen. There were many large-scale protests after the handover.  Most of them were peaceful and related to events in China (e.g. commemoration of Tiananmen Square Massacre) and calling for universal suffrage.  Practical all of the demonstrations did not result in much improvement in democracy.  The 2017 \u201cUmbrella Movement\u201d lasted 2 months with the occupation of the Central District, but again it failed in achieving its goals.  After the fizzling out of the Umbrella Movement, the government started arresting activists.  This is a reminder to the current protesters that failure is not an option. Current Protests: The current unrest started with the opposition to the proposed extradition law and evolved into many other things: police brutality, universal suffrage, etc.  Both sides are increasingly more violence, from the use of tear gas to live ammunition by the police, and from traffic blockage to firebombing by protesters.  The recent introduction of emergency ordinance appeared to increase the anger of the protesters. The tactics used by the police (and its sympathizers) and the protesters could easily result in fatalities.  Two protesters have been shot since the start of the protests 4 months ago.  These two incidents could easily result in fatalities.  So is firebombing and mob beating of individuals.  Right now, I put a 75% chance of having at least 3 fatalities in this protest movement.  I will be watching the situation closely to see what happens after the declaration of emergency ordinance and adjust my forecast accordingly.

The current law keeps China out, but they can send troops as needed [3], though I wonder who would enforce that law right now if China violated it.  Britain has plenty of their own problems to manage, the US seems to be running away from democratic complainants either to avoid issues or as a favor to those in the position of power, and there doesn't seem to be much of a unified coalition to oppose China moving in to preserve security and economic/social stability except through sanctions and diplomatic measures.  Although China isn't in the strongest position now and they have been conservative about taking aggressive positions that they haven't prepared for well in advance and are generally well-prepared to handle, I think they would be more willing to move in before the protests lead to general chaos than to let them become a trigger or signal for something less manageable now or in the future.  And China will want something that can be done behind the scenes or done without state violence, and do it quickly and efficiently.  There have already been rumors and official clarifications of fatalities [4], and unless someone dies on the street in front of a camera, I wonder how clear the fatality outcome will be.  I would expect a great many injuries, not many fatalities now that it's a real threat. 1 - https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/07/chinese-soldiers-in-hong-kong-warn-protesters-as-emergency-rules-fail-to-quell-unrest.html\n2 - https://www.wsj.com/articles/hong-kong-emergency-law-fails-to-stop-masked-protesters-taking-over-streets-11570350249\n3 - https://www.pri.org/stories/2019-09-10/how-close-are-hong-kong-s-protests-china-s-red-line\n4 - https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3026439/hong-kong-protests-officials-attempt-sixth-time-debunk"], [20284, "2019-10-07T19:59:31Z", [0.95], "When the upcoming crack down comes there will be bloodshed."], [1333, "2019-10-07T18:24:19Z", [0.55], ""], [1333, "2019-10-07T18:14:00Z", [0.45], ""], [677, "2019-10-07T18:02:48Z", [1.0], ""], [3429, "2019-10-07T16:24:03Z", [0.6], ""], [75093, "2019-10-07T15:15:51Z", [0.55], ""], [79314, "2019-10-07T13:15:13Z", [1.0], ""], [691, "2019-10-07T12:15:38Z", [0.76], ""], [61367, "2019-10-07T10:31:23Z", [0.37], ""], [13306, "2019-10-07T05:34:07Z", [0.55], ""], [21046, "2019-10-07T02:12:54Z", [0.3], ""], [3997, "2019-10-07T01:12:07Z", [0.82], ""], [33887, "2019-10-07T00:35:51Z", [1.0], ""], [12573, "2019-10-06T23:08:33Z", [0.98], ""], [1333, "2019-10-06T19:17:41Z", [0.36], ""], [1333, "2019-10-06T19:07:49Z", [0.35], ""], [172, "2019-10-06T18:58:58Z", [0.65], ""], [691, "2019-10-06T12:42:56Z", [0.76], ""], [26551, "2019-10-06T10:11:34Z", [0.55], "Forecasting on Chinese/HK mentality can be complicated, especially for me as I have no relation at all with this. On one side, there is an escalation of violence, apparently from both sides: \"Police had warned that officers feared having to shoot people in order to protect themselves. In this case videos showed protesters viciously attacking a policeman on the ground before a colleague ran towards the group and fired at Mr Tsang... The officer who used the gun also carried non-lethal weapons.\" [1]. And \"Five police were hospitalised, including one with third-degree burns, allegedly caused by corrosive fluid thrown by rioters.\" [1]. If it is the intention of the HK government to calm things down, certainly violence and fatalities will not help. However, this might not be their approach to unrest anymore, as seems apparent from the invocation of the Emergency Regulations Ordinance on October 4th [2] banning the wearing of masks as only measure. This happened right after Carrie Lam (HK Chief Executive) returned from the 70th anniversary of Communist Party massive military demonstration \"Mrs Lam denied that anyone from the central government had asked her to issue the edict during her visit. But after her announcement, a central-government spokesman said that banning masks was essential. \" [2]. Apparently, today a \"Hong Kong court rejects mask ban challenge\" [4]. Not mentioned anywhere, but maybe even Ms Lam's position was at risk for a tougher ruler. So, it seems that violence is escalating and the HK government is taking a tougher position, making the fatalities more likely. However, I'm unclear about the consequences of this outcome, from internationalisation to rejections from more peaceful groups of protesters (\"Hong Kongers know how to protest\", a short but good summary here [5]) or, when properly manipulated, justification for a Chinese intervention, unimpressed by the Sino-American commercial war and a troubled (?) Trump, and concerned about \"democratic contamination\" to mainland.\n\nAbout the calendar, tomorrow October 7th is the Chung Yeng festival, apparently Legislative Council is due to reconvene on October 16th and there are local councils elections on November 24th.

There have been 16 HK police officers killed since 1983, (none in a demonstration) which is roughly 1 police death every 2 years, the last one was in 2018. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallant_Garden) As far as I can tell, a protestor in Hong Kong has not been killed at least since the handover of power in 1997. No protestors were killed in the 2014 Umbrella protests, although there was around 500 injuries in civil conflict which lasted 2 and a half months. The Hong Kong protests began 31st March of this year, and there has not currently been any fatalities on either side. 2 protestors have been shot in the last week, one in the chest, one in the leg, by a HK standard police revolver which is 90% likely to be a derivative of a smith and wesson model 10. These are not especially powerful handguns, and it seems that protestors who are injured are being looked after despite their injuries. It is still possible that these two protestors who have been shot may die (would that count towards the three total need for the resolution?) but reports have suggested they will not die.\u2028\u2028Considering what will happen if the civil conflict escalates is important to the resolution of the question. The next step is probably a declaration of emergency, invoking the \"Emergency Regulations Ordinance\" which \u201cmake any regulations whatsoever which he [or she] may consider desirable in the public interest\u201d if she (Carrie Lam) considered it an occasion of \u201cemergency or public danger\u201d if she believed the police were likely to lose control of the streets. This could be sparked by fatalities or simply loss of the ability to control the demonstrators. Lam may \"call in the Chinese\" but this will NOT be the Peoples Liberation Army but the Peoples Armed Police, who are trained in riot control. (https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/china-army-hongkong/) The HK police and the PAP know that protestor deaths will work against them and their ability to maintain \"stability\" in the territory. I do not think the HK authorities or the CCP will back down, nor do I think the demonstrators are ready to do so. The situation is different to the 2014 protests, China has become more centralised under Xi Jinping, and with few consequences for dealing with HK from the west he has significant freedom of movement. \u2028\u2028This does NOT mean fatalities, as demonstrators do not have access to weapons aside from improvised ones, and the police are going to want to avoid fatalities, as is the PAP if they are deployed. \u2028 The HK police are currently stretched by the demonstrators, they will undoubtably be tired, frustrated and low on morale that they have thus far failed to contain the demonstrations as they have increased in ferocity (from @Anneinak - \"On National Day, police fired about 1,400 rounds of tear gas, 900 rubber bullets, 190 beanbag rounds and 230 sponge-tipped rounds. By contrast, they had fired 3,100 tear gas rounds, 590 rubber bullets, 80 beanbag rounds and 290 sponge-tipped rounds between June 9 and Sept. 20.\")  I think if fatalities occur they are likely to be caused by the HK police, in a situation where they believe they have no other alternative than to discharge their firearms. The shots which have been fired are lucky in that they have not yet caused fatalities, especially the protestor shot in the chest, a couple of inches the other way and he would have been dead. Three fatalities can be reached very quickly in street violence. There does not seem an easy way to climb down for either side, and the intensity of the protests could well mean that we are about to see the first few casualties in Hong Kong, despite the very low base rate."], [26553, "2019-10-06T00:34:13Z", [0.09], "Xi Ping words toning things down, numbers of protestors dropping"], [38, "2019-10-05T19:10:29Z", [0.51], "\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/after-hong-kong-protester-shot-cycle-violence-threatens-more-tragedy-ncna1062431 Oct. 4, 2019, \nBy Ying Ma\nA tragedy appears ever more imminent in Hong Kong. As anti-government, anti-Beijing protests continue into their 17th week, clashes between law enforcement and protesters have become increasingly ugly and more violent. On Tuesday,. . .an 18-year-old protester in Hong Kong was shot in the chest with a live round by the police. It has become commonplace for the radical elements of the city\u2019s democracy movement \u2014 namely, young protesters \u2014 to do battle with the more powerful police force. Weekend after weekend, violence rages on. Unless something changes, it is only a matter of time before a real tragedy involving fatalities occurs. Further escalation in violence could also lead to a much more severe crackdown by the Hong Kong government or a military intervention by Beijing . . .  The young protesters have resorted to violence because they believe it to be effective and necessary in their fight against Beijing\u2019s encroachment upon their city\u2019s autonomy under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d system, the Hong Kong government\u2019s ineptitude in safeguarding their rights or offering hope for their future, and the rampant police brutality that has come bearing down on their movement. Numerous marches, rallies, protests and sing-alongs \u2014 numbering hundreds of thousands, and at times millions \u2014 have been peaceful, touching and inspirational. They have also reflected the frustrations common among broad segments of Hong Kong\u2019s population. Yet, peaceful protests on their own did not win concessions from Beijing. In July, when violence broke out and protesters stormed the Legislative Council, Hong Kong\u2019s parliament, the movement saw concrete results. The city\u2019s chief executive declared dead the controversial proposed extradition bill that had set off the protests. As violence escalated, she ultimately withdrew the bill. The protesters noticed and so did democracy activists who have historically advocated for nonviolent civil disobedience. The excessive use of force by the police has been a rallying cry for protesters as well, and has galvanized support for the movement across Hong Kong society. . . .  The youngsters on the front lines . . .  have responded by actively engaging in arson, vandalism, road blockades, brick and petrol-bomb throwing and destruction of public property. Their resistance is not sporadic, but systematic and organized. The protesters\u2019 trashing of Hong Kong\u2019s metro stations has now become routine. About half of the city\u2019s 91 stations have been damaged. . . .\n. . . \nViolence begets more violence. After four months of protests, both sides \u2014 police and protesters \u2014 have dug in. The police force, until recently known as \u201cAsia\u2019s finest,\u201d have plenty of their own grievances, and see the protesters as thugs, hooligans, rioters and terrorists. Violent clashes have left them bloodied and on edge. In July, one officer had part of his finger bitten off by a protester. On China\u2019s National Day, the most violent day of protests, multiple officers were injured with a corrosive liquid, with one incurring third-degree burns. Meanwhile, the police vigorously defend the shooting of the 18-year-old protester, noting the officer\u2019s life was threatened as he attempted to rescue a colleague who had been thrown to the ground and was being attacked with bricks and sharp objects by about 10 protesters. On National Day, police fired about 1,400 rounds of tear gas, 900 rubber bullets, 190 beanbag rounds and 230 sponge-tipped rounds. By contrast, they had fired 3,100 tear gas rounds, 590 rubber bullets, 80 beanbag rounds and 290 sponge-tipped rounds between June 9 and Sept. 20. U.S. lawmakers have worried that Beijing will deploy the People\u2019s Liberation Army amassed across the border in the city of Shenzhen to quell Hong Kong\u2019s unrest. (Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam has said that Beijing \u201chas absolutely no plan to send in the PLA.\u201d) Indeed, Beijing insists it wants to avoid a bloody crackdown like the one at Tiananmen Square in 1989, where peaceful pro-democracy student protestors were massacred. Nevertheless, an escalation in violence does not require the PLA. Police officers, believing their lives are in danger, could ramp up their tactics. On Tuesday, although only one protesteor was shot with a live round, five other live rounds were fired throughout the city, some as warning shots. ~~~~~~~\nCOMMENTS\nFatalities is a high bar.

Fatalities obviously undermine that. Given growing news about Trumps impeachment and Brexit, they may just want to keep this off the front pages for the time being. There have been no fatalities so far, so it seems that those disciplining the protest are disciplined in that way. Of course, I am going on the assumption that suicides do not count as fatalities, as there have been 8 suicides so far. If suicides count, I would absolutely raise my prediction a large amount.
