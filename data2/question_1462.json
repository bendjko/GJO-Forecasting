As a next idea, I found a 2018 movie awards dataset via BigML then used a machine learning algorithm (LightGBM) with a model explainer algorithm (SHAP) to identify what factors influenced award winners. Basically, metacritic reviews, gross revenue and duration were the key drivers. Genres such as drama and biography also played a small minor part. I didn't use gross revenue as part of the base rate calculation since I feel that it is become less relevant with streaming services. I weighted metacritic reviews (eg. aggregated reviews via rotten tomatoes and imbd) as 90% and duration as 10%. I then combined my values with crowd forecasts to give the final predictions. If I were to make improvements, I would watch all the movies myself and mark them against a criteria and/or put in the effort to make an actual AI driven predictor.

Marriage Story has gotten a good bit of buzz and press (though I don't think that many people have seen it, comparatively)...and, it seems a bit boring (but I have not seen it).
