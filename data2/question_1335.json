Bans on cigarettes have mostly centered on banning where cigarettes can be smoked, like restaurants, public spaces, and work spaces. Some of these bans have now been extended to vaping products. Lobbying: Juul spent $1.2 million on federal lobbying during 2019Q3. Their lobbyists were fighting proposal to ban flavored e-cigarette pods, pushing legislation that includes provisions denying local governments the right to adopt strict vaping controls, and working to make sure bills to discourage youth vaping did not have stringent enforcement. [9, 10] Inside view: \nThe FDA banned flavored vaping products with the exception of tobacco and menthol [1]. Trump signed a law in December that raised the legal age to purchase cigarettes, e-cigarettes, cigars and other tobacco products to 21. [1] Massachusetts issued a 4 month blanket ban on all vaping products in September. The temporary blanket expired Dec. 11. The ban was meant to allow time to develop permanent regulations that will ensure risks are known to consumers, address risks identified by the developing science, and ensure sellers are not skirting the new law and selling to kids. A new law set to take effect on June 1, 2020 is not a blanket ban, but instead limits the sale of flavored nicotine vaping (and tobacco) products, including menthol to \u2018licensed smoking bars where they may only be smoked on-site.\u2019 It also levies a 75% excise tax on e-cigarettes [2]. Michigan put an emergency ban into place Sept. 18 on nicotine vaping product in any flavor except tobacco. By Oct. 15 a judge put an injunction on the ban for 6 months.  New York on September 17 became the first state to implement a statewide ban on most flavored nicotine vaping products (excluding menthol). Before the ban was to go into effect on October 4, a court placed a hold on the ban.  Rhode Island banned the sale of flavored e-cigarettes. A judge allowed the ban to stand.  Montana sought to ban all flavored e-cigarettes, including those containing THC and CBD for 120 days, which would have taken effect on Oct. 22 but a Montana judge blocked the policy on Oct 19.  Washington health officials passed an emergency rule on Oct. 9 to ban the sale of flavored vaping products to last 120 days.  Oregon on Oct.  11 filed rules to forbid the sale of flavored nicotine and cannabis vaping products for 6 months. The policy was partially blocked by an appeals  In California the Governor issued an executive order on Sept 16 that allocated funds for a \u2018vaping awareness campaign,\u2019 calls on state agencies to develop recommendation for limiting the sales of vaping products to anyone younger than 21, and the sales of illegal or counterfeit vaping products. The governor said he would like to ban flavored e-cigarettes outright but could not do so through executive action. San Francisco became the first major US city to ban the sale of all nicotine e-cigarette products after a vote in November (went into effect in January 2020) [6].   There have been 2,602 lung injury cases that required hospitalization and 57 deaths linked to vaping. Vaping related ER visits peaked in September. In November the vaping illness was linked to vitamin E acetate [7, 8].  None of the state bans except for the short-term Massachusetts ban sought to ban the *sale* of e-cigarettes and instead focused on banning flavored products. Of those flavor bans, many were blocked by judges due to lawsuits. Recently no state has banned the sale of cigarettes. Despite the branding of e-cigarettes as safer, I think we can use the lack of full bans on cigarettes as a base rate for vaping products. The impetus for many of the current bans was the mystery surrounding vaping illness and the prevalence of young people vaping. With the new FDA ban on all flavored vaping products, raising the legal age to purchase e-cigarettes, and the CDC linking the vaping illness to vitamin E acetate often from illegal THC vapes, I believe the pressure to ban these products has abated.  It is possible another state will pass another short-term full ban if there were to be another spate of illnesses or deaths related to vaping. However given the fact that only one did it during the last health crisis in September, I think this probability will be low (5-10%). I will be putting the rest of the weight on no states banning vaping products.

I am surprised by this development, especially given that the CDC in the US has found that it is specifically THC-containing products that seem to  have caused the vast majority of vaping-related illnesses [2]. Nevertheless, because of this recent ban by China, I find it more likely that more U.S. states will ban the retail sale of vaping products but I still think that such outright bans are very unlikely.

Based on data collected as of October 15, 2019, use of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-containing products in the 3 months preceding symptom onset was reported by 86% of patients.\" [1] 86% is a very significant figure, and is almost certainly even higher since underreporting of THC use is very likely since non-medical marijuana is still illegal in most states.  So, now that it's extremely likely that the culprit of vaping-related illnesses/deaths has been identified, state authorities will have even less of a reason to impose a blanket ban on the retail sale of vaping products. Rather, products that contain THC are likely to be targeted instead.

The mortality of this unknown illness is about 2% (about 26 deaths out of 1299 illness) [2].  CDC is currently investigating the cause of this illnesses and death. \n\nThis sudden outbreak of vaping illnesses and death is intriguing and it points to possible links to recent changes in vaping products.  There are indications that suggest chemicals (THC, Vitamin E acetate and others) added to vaping oil are potential  causes [2], but it will take time for the CDC investigation to arrive at a conclusion, probably till May next year. Currently Massachusetts is the only state that fully bans vaping products (but the legislation was passed before the start date of this question and therefore does not count).  Five states (Rhode Island, Washington, Minnesota, New York and California) have partial bans.  The partial bans are partly due to the uncertainty in their causes and pressure from the vaping industry.  It is likely that additional partial bans in other states will happen as the vaping illness does not appear to be diminishing. However, full bans of vaping products are unlikely, with the exception of a couple of liberal states, such as California.  This assessment would change if CDC finds vaping itself alone is the cause (which I assess to be unlikely because of the past extensive usage of vaping with no reported illness in the last 15 years).

Cigarettes in Arkansas are taxed at a rate of $1.15 per pack. The bill would add e-cigarettes to the Arkansas Clean Indoor Air Act of 2006, which prohibits smoking indoors in public places. It also would ban e-cigarette advertising on outdoor billboards located within 1,000 feet of a public or private school or playground, and make other restrictions.
