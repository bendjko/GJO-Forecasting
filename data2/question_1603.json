About increases in testing:  I've read that DJT is promising that every state will be able to test 2% of its population per month:  that would mean .5% per week.  With 330m people, .5% per week would work out to 1,650,000, right?  Last week 1,526,787 people were tested.  So, achieving what DJT promised wouldn't mean such a huge increase.  On the other hand, if there is one universal cry, it is for more testing, so I wouldn't be surprised if the increase in testing exceeded DJT's goal. However, it appears to me that while an increase in the number of tests will certainly increase the number of new cases identified, the % of new cases found will decrease because not just the visibly sick will be tested.   What I saw when I was crunching the data from April 20-26th, was that on the 22nd, when the # of tests doubled, the PERCENT of new cases more than decreased by half, so the net result was only about 10% more new cases than on the prior day, not 100%. Then there's the impact of social distancing.  It should reduce the % of new cases, too.   So, I'm thinking that while there may be some to significant increases in testing, the % of new cases will fall so the number of new cases won't rise much more than it rose last week. @ikresnak says that DJT's goal was 2% on top of the current testing level, which would mean more than a doubling Am I missing something?  @marktscannell"], [57778, "2020-04-29T02:48:37Z", [0.01, 0.05, 0.45, 0.45, 0.04], ""], [86358, "2020-04-29T02:35:24Z", [0.03, 0.28, 0.33, 0.19, 0.17], ""], [88089, "2020-04-29T02:02:24Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.7, 0.3], ""], [21046, "2020-04-29T01:58:55Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.23, 0.75, 0.01], ""], [88086, "2020-04-29T01:20:20Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.1], ""], [11817, "2020-04-29T01:15:25Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.22, 0.77, 0.01], ""], [57992, "2020-04-29T00:02:09Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.15, 0.65, 0.2], ""], [87970, "2020-04-28T23:44:18Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [86513, "2020-04-28T23:27:09Z", [0.0, 0.07, 0.43, 0.41, 0.09], ""], [86069, "2020-04-28T22:58:21Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.15, 0.6, 0.15], "Average daily rise over the last week is roughly 3.29%.
