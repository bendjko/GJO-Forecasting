Previously I have tried the combination of recent trend + random walk, which is then properly Montecarlo-ed. This time I am trying a different approach: I decided to finally study the fractal geometry of the stock market. This is not difficult owing to the extensive research about this issue, see for instance [1] for a nice introduction. The point is the following:  1) If Y(t) is the log of a stock price at time t, it will follow a particular probability distribution pattern: < (Y(t+k) - Y(t)) / k^H > ~ follows a stable probability distribution where H is called the Hurst exponent. Actually it is not important what is the probability distribution, as we can determine it later by determining H, then making an histogram and finally dividing by bins. That is, we simply calculate base rates as we always do when applying the outside view, where the only difference with the standard outside view is that we need some theory to determine H. 2) Now the Hurst exponent H is something really interesting:  2.a) For H = 1/2 we have a standard geometric random walk, which is not too predictable unless there is some trend, but it is not too unpredictable either. 2.b) For H > 1/2 we have a trend. This is easy to see, as this exponent increases, it will give rise to a smoother curve with much less zig-zag. If you have studied the idea of a fractal dimension, as H increases, the time dependence of the stock price will approach a fractal dimension of 1, i.e. it will behave as a standard smooth 1-dimensional curve. 2.c) For H < 1/2 it is easy to check that the relative noise increases (relatively) as the time decreases, and as H -> 0 my impression is that the fractal dimension of the stock price will approach 2. The point is that there is extreme noisiness, and this implies that errors are going to be considerable. 3) There are a lot of places where the calculation of H is explained [2,3,4], which means that it is basically a standard procedure, which I will not explain in detail here. 4) Regarding S&P500, the Hurst exponent over the last 256 trading days is about 0.85 and if we limit ourselves to the last 64 days is about 0.83. Do not take my word on it, as this is the first time I use this method and I could have gotten it wrong. However, if my calculation is correct, the trend in S&P500 is more likely to continue than not. And it is also expected to be relatively predictable. By using the Hurst exponents I have calculated, outside-viewing Y(t+k) - Y(t) and then binning I obtained the previous probabilities. There are a few caveats though: I have made a few simplifications when binning (i.e. calculating the base rates) and besides, one can get different probabilities depending on the time span used to calculate these base rates. This means that you should not take this as something particularly more predictive than much more crude methods. 5) So let's cross fingers and see whether with this method I am able to improve my Brier on market quesions.
