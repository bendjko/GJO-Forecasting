However,\n/a top movie this year is played in more than 3,700 theaters (which could indicate that 20% of theaters are out of business permanently) and is able to rake 57mn USD in a Fri-to-Mon first weekend performance, a holiday included.\nhttps://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl2819065345/?ref_=bo_sl_table_1\n/it is striking how quick the box office results decline: -35% on Day 2 and -50% on Day 3 versus debut day. It points to a large interest from a certain cinema-keen target group, but the broad interest of the young and active population with a high purchase power (at least before the pandemic...), who used to go to the movies as a pastime has not recovered yet.\n/a single top release can make up for roughly up to  40% of box office results (57,000,000 versus a cumulative gross of 186,332,947 from 70 releases in total so far this summer season) which means 20 times its proportionate share. My view is that this straddle of very good versus average or bad results has widened because of the pandemic and is likely to remain important throughout the pandemic year 2021, despite vaccination. There will be a few must-see releases that will attract a high number of viewers, while the rest will be more or less ignored. Thus, the main factor driving a high gross appears to be interesting releases.\n/extrapolation from the May rump figures to a full month May results a gross of roughly 240mn USD. Given that May might still be the weakest of the summer months, and given the slight under-estimation due to restrictions in place as mentioned above (or felt by the public), a normal summer month in 2021 could produce a gross result of 300mn USD under current conditions.\n/a top release in 2021 so far produces only 10% of what it used to be in 2012, 2015, 2018 and 2019 but already exceeds Tenet (2020) by 150%\n/a regular summer season brought about 380 releases  per season or 95 per month (bandwidth: 346 in 2011, 425 in 2018 over the past ten years). The 70 releases of May 7th through May 31st indicate a decrease of 20-25% in the number of releases this whole season. The number could thus end at 300 (2020: 86)\n/the current gross this summer season is still below what \"The Avengers\" (2012, 4,349 theaters, 242 days https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl709199361/?ref_=bo_sl_table_10 ) had grossed after three days (04-06 May 2012) alone already. It is to date also only about 4.5 per cent of what an average season totaled between 2011 and 2019.  With regards to the progress being made (new cases, people fully vaccinated,...) and an increasingly normal attitude of the population, the three months of 2021 that will resolve this question could \n/see 300 releases, of which 280 will likely gross 20mn USD or less\n/have one or two releases the gross of which exceeds 100mn USD each before the question ends\n/end with a total gross that represents 20% of 2019's gross (4.342bn USD), likely a bit higher: between 850- 900mn USD\n/will be very dependent on quality and popularity of single releases, and whether the studios are willing to release them to the theaters under (still-) pandemic conditions\n/could depend on small details such as sanitizing or mask-wearing requirements during the stay at the theater, which likely impacts the experience of the viewing, and possible future changes in requirements.\n/find important releases being scheduled on the labour day weekend and thus outside of the time frame of this question.

Feb. 2021 will be 6.42% of inflation adjusted Feb. 2020. For Jan 2021 versus 2017,2018, and 2019 it was 6.18% and for 2021 vs. 2020 it was 6.49%, respectively. If I project June, July, and August 2021 by using the Jan and Feb 2021 performance versus 2019-2017, gross revenue comes in at about $185 million. If I use the Jan and Feb 2021 performance versus 2020, my projection comes in at about $215 million.   And this would all be under the assumption that covid/gatherings would be equally restrictive from June-August as it was from Jan-Feb. Also assuming movies would be as limited as they were from Jan-Feb. The Croods is the box office winner of 2021 so far, it's first installment was released in 2013 which was the 14th best performing movie of that year, grossed about $590 million. @MCowley has done a nice job outlining the upcoming releases for this summer.  To get to $500 million, performance would have to be a hair over 15% of what is was from 2019-2017 on average. For $1 billion, just over 30%. And finally for $1.75 billion, a just over 52%.  Currently, about 6.8% of the population is vaccinated [1]. If we assume vaccinations keep at the rate of 1.7 million per day for March and April and then up to 3 million a day for May, plus add in the Johnson & Johnson shots expected, and lets assume only half of those 100 million doses promised by June are delivered/administered to be conservative. That still gets me to almost half the population vaccinated by June 1st. There's a chance we could have herd immunity by sometime this summer [4]. Depends on a lot of factors.  Now I just want to talk about what it would like to do the numbers I'm projecting (and this is the driver of my forecast). To be over $500 million, I think theaters need to be at 15.2% of what they were from 2019-2017. That means for a sold out crowd in 2019, that theater only needs to be 15% full. For $1 billion, 30% full. For 1.75 billion, 53% full. And again, that would be max occupancy. For reference look at the NBA's current occupancy rates for the 14 teams allowing fans [5]. Most are already at 10%. New York is going to allow theaters to re-open and CA is expected to follow suit, they combined have 15% of theaters and are going to be two of the most cautious states overall I'd imagine [6]. If the NBA already has some stadiums 15% full, the only reason I can't see theaters being 15% full at the max by June 1st is something going very wrong with covid (variant or massive vaccine production problem). I will check back in around the end of March, April, and May, but I expect the trendline to steadily tick up.

In a typical year, January is a good average of June July and August.  However, there are still lockdowns affecting many movie theaters especially in very populated states like California and New York. I expect the rate of covid infections to drop off dramatically over this month because it seems to be following the curve of the flu season. Also the rhetoric being put out by the media about the virus changed on exactly the day of Biden's inauguration. It is now no longer doom and gloom and it is now a tone of solving the problem and climbing out of the hole. By May I expect all states to be fully open.  not very well known but very important to recognize with all of this is that the way they are testing people is changing. Florida and Colorado have focused on what the PCR threshold rates of the tests are. The other states are still using PCR tests with too many cycles causing a very large number of false positives. according to the New York times the number false positives could be as high as 90%. This is why the State of Florida which is one of the oldest states in the country is fully open even Disney World and full tourism, with lower covid rates, while California, which is one of the youngest states in the country is still heavily locked down with very high covid rates. It's because the way they have different testing thresholds. Based on press releases from the CDC and WHO, and based on the way this has changed politically now that Biden is in office, I expect more dtates to be more conscious of their PCR testing thresholds. This will bring down the number of cases dramatically which can be explained to the public by immunizations. In short, I expect the fearmongering revolving around the virus to drop off over the spring.  This means that I expect June July and August to have a significantly higher box office than January of this year. However, there will still be some continued hesitation and I think the economy is going to be very poor. https://www.boxofficemojo.com/month/by-year/2021/?grossesOption=calendarGrosses https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/health/coronavirus-testing.html"], [98228, "2021-01-30T16:36:20Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.35, 0.5], ""], [98217, "2021-01-30T15:35:40Z", [0.07, 0.28, 0.45, 0.15, 0.05], ""], [60695, "2021-01-30T07:26:25Z", [0.25, 0.5, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [22689, "2021-01-30T05:46:32Z", [0.3, 0.6, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [14266, "2021-01-30T03:22:34Z", [0.05, 0.45, 0.4, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [97185, "2021-01-30T02:42:52Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.43, 0.35, 0.07], "lol, just massive rethinking based on december 2020 being half of december 2019 and a better list of what is scheduled https://www.movieinsider.com/movies/2021"], [97185, "2021-01-30T02:28:28Z", [0.0, 0.35, 0.65, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [92079, "2021-01-30T02:22:35Z", [0.0, 0.69, 0.31, 0.0, 0.0], "Flat through Q1 2021.
