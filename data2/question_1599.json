So, I'm introducing a new model [1] that does the following: 1. Projects linearly based on declining growth slope since (what looks like) the peak on Fri, Apr 10th\n2. Adjusts for day of week variation - there's clear day-of-week variation where counts on Sat/Sun/Mon/Tue are lower than expected if following a perfect linear slope, and counts on Wed/Thu/Fri are higher than expected. See graph on model spreadsheet.\n3. Dials up the confidence by reducing standard deviation around the projected mean (projected count minus today's count, divided by 6) On a side note, it should also be much easier to look at for all of you who've been peeking at my models each day!
