(my thoughts) In the last 40 years, NK has launched around 140 missiles. \n\nLast week, NK has claimed that it successfully tested a new hypersonic missile,  labeling it a \"strategic weapon\", suggesting that it has nuclear capabilities. It also uses a technology that enables it to be pre-fueled & launch-ready for years. \n\nWhat is a hypersonic missile?\n\"Hypersonic missiles are much faster and more agile than normal ones, making them much harder for missile defence systems to intercept.\"\nOnly few other countries - China, Russia, the US and India- have the technological know-how.  Although the precise capabilities of the launched missile is hard to assess - South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said they believed this hypersonic missile was still at an early stage of development and it will take a considerable period of time before it can be deployed in combat.-, it could \"presumably present a very different challenge for missile defence from traditional ballistic missiles.\"  In order to see what's coming next, I believe it's necessary to take a step back to understand why does NK continue developing its weapons despite decade of sanctions. Some relevant factors are:\n1) To keep of with its neighbors \nFor example, recently SK tested its first submarine-launched ballistic missile, claiming it to be needed as deterrence against North Korea's \"provocations\". NK has repeatedly accused SK of double standards over military activities.\nAnd concerning the nuclear power, although SK doesn't have it, its ally - the US- has couple of thousands of nuclear warheads.  2) To rally the people - especially when times are tough.\nI think this is most important for the moment. It's said that economic situation is especially dire nowadays because of the Covid, and reduction of supplies from China.  What's their long-term plan? I have no clues. As far as the question, I think NK wants to establish its power and show that sanctions are irrelevant as far as it goes to advancing their \"defence\" systems. In fact, the busy month of September - during which NK launched 3 missiles - could be a response to the joint military exercise in August between SK and the US.\nhttps://www.reuters.com/world/skorea-us-begin-joint-military-drills-monday-yonhap-2021-08-15/\nWill NK continue further in the coming months of 2021?

The objective of building an ICBM is obviously linked to their latter goal and of course gaining an ability to target US. -  In Sep of 2017, it seems credible that NK tested a thermo-nuclear weapon ~ 250 KT yield, so that potentially means the former goal is met. Which brings us to next goal- miniaturization. The only way to test this is by missile launches of all kinds - in this context, I must thank @smingers for the excellent resource on the missile test\ndatabase https://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/cns-north-korea-missile-test-database/ - Now it seems  reasonable to me, given the argument I made above, the likelihood of (any) missile launch > likelihood of nuclear test. If we were to count from 2006, we have about 140 missile tests of all kinds (including successes and failures). Rounding off, that means ~ 10 tests/year. In fact, we already had one in Mar-21. Of these, 3 were ICBM and 6 were Space launch vehicles. But it's important to point out about 6 of them, came since 2012 and the last of them were in 2017 (possibly playing chicken with TrumP). Does it imply an annual base rate between 2/3 and 1? - Most NK experts believe that NK is a strategic player, using nuclear power as a bargaining chip. It seems that Covid may not had a direct, but an indirect (and devastating impact) due to impact on trade. Or more succinctly, dramatic drop in trading monies with its partners that don't care about US sanctions. Which means the US sanctions must hurt more than usual.What would be the game theoretic optimal strategy for Kim? I think, China as another strategic player in this \"game\", complicates matters considerably.  Although I can imagine exceptions, a worse US-China relationship should probably make NK more hostile. And symbolic hostility has been the only negotiating tool NK has used over the years (or it seems).  -Given all this, with six months to go, I would estimate an even chance for something to happen- in other words, 50% for No. And as discussed before, it's far more likely to launch an ICBM or a space vehicle than a nuclear test.

We should look at the historical data to set initial probabilities, but there are a lot of idiosyncrasies about North Korea that are not present with other nuclear states, and their situation is quite unique, so I do not think using \"typical nuclear state\" data makes sense. We first analyze the probability of detonating a nuclear device. North Korea has detonated 6 devices in the past 15 years that they have had the ability to test a nuclear weapon, leading to a base rate of 6/15 = 0.4. However this has occurred more in recent years as they have gotten more aggressive and admittedly capable in their nuclear powers, in particular in the Obama administration vs the Trump administration. So I think using the base rate of 5 tests in the 8 years of the Obama administration is more accurate, as corroborated in my previous response. This gives a rate of about 60% for detonating a nuclear device every year. There is only half a year until Jan 1 2022, so a chance of 30% for a nuclear test before Jan 1 2022. We can also look at the historical data for ICBMs from North Korea. North Korea first had capabilities for an ICBM in 2017 and conducted 3 launches in 2017 and none since. Note this year was just before Trump with a different foreign policy focused on appeasement and denuclearization took power. There is not any more historical data on ICBMs and North Korea seems to conduct many nuclear tests every year except 2020, including one earlier this year in 2021. So given how North Korea's attitudes should match theirs in 2017 as per my previous post, I would in fact argue that there is a very high chance of an ICBM launch, maybe even 60% for the year (based on the many ICBM launches in 2017, but the lack of launches in subsequent years, and the increased similarity politically of 2017 and 2021). There is only half a year until Jan 1 2022, so a chance of 30% for an ICBM launch before Jan 1 2022.  As noted in my previous post, the historical data seems to suggest that North Korea's ICBM launches and nuclear detonations occur together. Historically it seems that neither occur in around 60% of years based on a historical data. Moreover there are more nuclear denotations than ICBM launches. So I would say 25% chance of both, a 10% chance for only a nuclear detonation, a 5% chance of launching an ICBM only, and a 60% chance of neither."], [86658, "2021-07-02T14:36:19Z", [0.05, 0.07, 0.02, 0.86], ""], [94563, "2021-07-02T14:18:17Z", [0.03, 0.11, 0.01, 0.85], ""], [2965, "2021-07-01T23:55:25Z", [0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.97], "With an incipient famine and Covid-19 outbreak totally dependent on PRC for food and vaccine, and with approximately 50 nuclear devices, Kim III stands pat "], [83135, "2021-07-01T15:36:26Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [99993, "2021-07-01T13:46:17Z", [0.03, 0.26, 0.01, 0.7], ""], [99780, "2021-07-01T12:47:19Z", [0.25, 0.12, 0.21, 0.42], "I'm struggling to find reports more recent than March on NK missile tests; going to continue to revise downward the probability that either a nuke or ICBM are launched in this year, though my priors lead me to a higher forecast than the consensus here."], [101422, "2021-07-01T12:35:40Z", [0.25, 0.25, 0.0, 0.5], "Should there be a need to bolster support for the regime at home as well as propaganda, there could be one or the other.

This is an approach Biden is sharply rejecting as indicated by this article, with Biden refusing to grant North Korea international recognition. In contrast, while Obama did not take an explicitly aggressive approach, he still refused to grant North Korea legitimacy and held America's position, similarly to Biden: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/17/world/asia/trump-north-korea-threat.html. With this in mind it is reasonable to assume that relations would pick up through 2021, the first year of the Biden administration, similarly to in 2017; this also seems logical considering Biden and Obama are of closer political background than towards Trump. At the twilight years of the Obama administration in 2016 and 2017, North Korea conducted many nuclear tests and a few ICBM launches, documented at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_weapons_tests_of_North_Korea, https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/25/world/asia/north-korea-ballistic-missiles.html, and https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-54500550. So it is reasonable to assume that North Korea will take an aggressive nuclear stance, which is further corroborated by https://www.npr.org/2021/05/02/992874499/north-korea-warns-u-s-over-bidens-big-blunder. However such nuclear tests only occur a few times a year at most in 2016-2017  and ICBM launches are similarly rare, as noted by the previous sources. Such an action would be unwise for North Korea from many perspectives, such as economic, political, etc., as indicated by Biden's aggressive stance. We can see that in 2017 and before North Korea conducted several nuclear tests, and that the ICBM launches then occurred, from the previous sources; it is unlikely that the ICBM launch would occur without the nuclear test according to the historical trend. This logic leads to my answer noted above; the largest single chance is that neither event will occur (say 50% probability), then the next most likely event is that both will if a pattern similar to 2017 plays out (say 30% probability), and then the only remaining larger chance outcome is that North Korea only conducts a nuclear test (say 15% probability)."], [691, "2021-06-10T17:43:11Z", [0.0, 0.3, 0.0, 0.7], ""], [101311, "2021-06-10T17:08:16Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.0, 0.95], "North Korea does not have many positive international relations so an attack on another country would likely lead to retaliation from multiple countries.

At the same time, the North Korean government believes that its missile and nuclear programs are key components of its foreign diplomacy. This means that even if investing in missile/nuclear programs will divert much-needed resources away from civilians, the North Korean government will very likely pursue weapons development to further disrupt US-China relations and potentially initiate sanction-relief talks with the United States. A quick sweep of reported North Korean tests also reveal an interesting pattern - a ramp up of activity in July/August (2017, 2019) and also alternating years between increased and decreased testing. Following these patterns, if North Korea was to detonate a nuclear weapon or launch an ICBM, it would likely to be sometime between July and August. There is not guarantee that the alternating years of activity will continue (especially since these years of inactivity correspond to changes in policy and relations).  From the perspective of the United States, the North Korean nuclear/missile problem may also not be their top priority. Namely, they may be most concerned about renegotiating the Iran nuclear deal. This means that North Korea may proceed with its testing. As of today, I think the probability of North Korea launching/testing a ICBM in the following months is quite high (i.e., 60%).

'There are also rumors of North Korea smuggling concentrated uranium produced in Pyongsan to Iran, Syria, Qatar, and Egypt, which lend weight to claims that North Korean authorities are expanding the production of concentrated uranium.\nIn fact, Daily NK\u2019s source claimed that North Korea is smuggling uranium ore in addition to concentrated uranium.\n\u201cAs far as I know, China requested uranium ore, not concentrated uranium,\u201d the source explained. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that China doesn\u2019t trust North Korea\u2019s refinement capabilities. This way, they can also get uranium ore for a lower price.\u201d\nThe source further reported that \u201cregardless of the [uranium\u2019s] form, the fact is that uranium smuggling is increasing,\u201d adding, \u201cThat\u2019s why more manpower is needed [for the uranium mining process].\u201d\nAsia Times, 04/12/21, '\u2018Worst ever\u2019 threat to Kim Jong Un\u2019s rule': https://asiatimes.com/2021/04/__trashed-7/\nClips from Times article:\n'The defector believes that the sanctions are working. \u201cThe country is about bankrupt,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think that the regime is sustainable at this rate.\u201d\nThat assessment may be more a reflection of a defector\u2019s hopes than a reliable prediction of collapse. The regime has found other ways to survive. The UN report details ongoing sanctions-busting exports of North Korean coal to China, and a flow of oil and other goods coming back in, with levels increasing in recent weeks but not reflected in official trade statistics.\nThe impact of sanctions on hard currency flows has been mitigated somewhat by extensive cybercrime carried out by the regime\u2019s Reconnaissance General Bureau, headquarters for cyber operations. Hacker units under the RGB such as the Lazarus group, the BeagleBoyz and the Bluenoroff Group have carried out successful thefts from cryptocurrency exchanges and other financial institutions, with revenue from such operations totaling at least $316 million from 2019 to November 2020, the UN report says.\nExperts warn against expectations that Kim Jong Un is anywhere close to yielding his grip on power. \u201cDespite pressures, which must be getting intense, Kim likely feels he has keys to solutions and is thus not desperate to negotiate,\u201d Brown told me.

Under Kim Jong-un\u2019s leadership, the country detonated weapons in February 2013, January and September 2016, and September 2017.\" [1] Thus since their first test, they have detonated a nuclear weapon in the first year of both of Obama's terms and Trump's term. On a very small sample, this is a base rate of 100%. Kim Jong Un has presided over 114 missile tests in his nearly 10 years in power, avg. 11/year, though the rate has somewhat declined in 2017-2020. They are believed to have 5 missile types with a range above 10,000 km: the Hwasong 13, 14, and 15, the KN 14, and the Taepodong 2 [1]. The Hwasong 13 has never been tested, the 14 and 15 were tested three times in 2017 (Trump's first year in office), and the KN 14 and Taepodong 2 have no record of being tested [2]. Thus far in 2021, an unnamed short-range missile has been tested twice, most recently on 24 Mar. Thus NK has a history of 3 ICBM tests and 6 nuclear tests since 2006, and in Trump's first year in office, both ICBMs and nukes were detonated. US policy toward NK has been incoherent given the change of administration from Obama to Trump and now Biden. My expectation is Biden will return to a NK policy far more inline with Obama, though that may prove impossible given the intervening years. Kim will be unwilling to give up the increased legitimacy conferred on him by meeting directly with a sitting US president, with no concessions provided in return. I would like to know more about China's position toward NK, why certain ICBMs have never been tested, what motivated ICBM and nuclear tests in the past, whether those tests were preceded by other events, such as tests of short-range missiles.

We assume the new missiles have a range equal or greater than the Hwasong 14.  As Kogo noted, tests tend to cluster, so it seems plausible that the current cluster will be capped off by the launch of one of the new missiles.  His assessment of 30% seems reasonable.\nRegarding nuclear tests,  the rate of 0.6 per year is correct, but in spite of breakdown in negotiations, there is not evidence I could find that North Korea has developed a larger yield nuclear device.  NK seems to be focusing more on delivery mechanisms than on larger yields, as the former is more a game-changer in terms of US perception of risk.  If NK conducts a test, I predict it will be a test of the miniaturized nuclear warhead that military intelligence believes they possess.  However, all tests to date have escalated in size.  A test of a smaller device would be technologically useful but symbolically less attractive, unless paired with test of a delivery mechanism.

I had the same initial thought as @dowser that testing could be related either to NK need to test a new capability or to a desire to message the international community. The two are linked of course b/c every test is also a message, but the distinction does drive timeline. NK is more likely to test if they need to verify a new capability than to use resources testing something they already have just to send a message. I'm inferring this based on the timing and pattern of past tests I'm not a subject matter expert. It looks like they are working on new capabilities, unsure if they will be ready to test this year https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-54500550 Also early in a new US or SK administration is usually a key time for messaging.
