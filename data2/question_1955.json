So if this Sunday it's around 92M\u2014slightly higher than Saturday's\u2014and picks back up to the average rate as last week (weekdays only), then it still falls short of 100M. I'm really interested in whether the daily count will start climbing again. As a side forecast, I do not expect it to continue a climbing trend in the next week. However, there may be a link to a climb in the daily vaccine count and the daily number of COVID cases recorded; we are seeing cases rise and therefore, if this hypothesis is true, will also see a rise in daily vaccines. Because of the spike and reasonability of crossing the 100M mark, I increase my probability for this bin.

Big gap! But, places are opening up large vaccination clinics. It's possible! If 2.45M/day, then 2.45M/day * 7 days * 0.64 (at least one dose) = 11.0M additional people who have had at least one dose. If 28.5M doses, then, say, 28.5M * .75 (at least one dose) = 21.4M (could be higher). But, would take 28.5M/7 = 4.1M doses/day, which is not plausible. So, about 11.0M to 21.4M additional people who have had at least one dose, with higher numbers less likely. Next week (March 29 to 31): Total Pfizer + Moderna on hand for 3 days could be, say, 9M or 10M. If 2.6M/day (Mon. to Wed., average is approx. weekly average), then 2.6M/day * 3 days * .64 (at least one dose) = 5.0M additional people who have had at least one dose. If, say, 10M doses given, then, say, 10 * .75 (at least one dose) = 7.5M (could be higher). So, 5.0M to, say, 7.5M additional people who have had at least one dose, with the higher end less likely. Total number of people who will have had at least one dose of vaccine by 3/31\n= 82.8M (reported 3/22) + 2.15M (adjustment for last week) + (11.0M to 21.4M for Pfizer/Moderna this week) + (5.0M to 7.5M for Pfizer/Moderna the last 3 days of March) + (1.3 to 2.5M for J&J)\n= 102.3M to 116.4M I'll be very surprised if fewer than 100M have had at least one dose by March 31. I'll be shocked if fewer than 95M. There could be very large vaccine deliveries this week. And, it's possible that more than 70% of the people who get vaccines this week and next will be getting their first dose. More than 105M is quite possible. To get to 115M by 3/31, an additional 32.2M more people would need to receive at least one dose by then. If the numbers of such people represent 65% of all vaccinations, we'd need to give 50M more vaccines by March 31, or ~5M/day. I just don't see that happening. Even if the numbers of such people represent 90% of all vaccinations, we'd need to give 35.8M more vaccinations by 3/31, or ~3.6M/day between now and then. That also doesn't seem likely. To get to 110M by 3/31, 27.7M more => 27.7M/0.65 = 42.6M => 4.3M doses/day. 27.7M/0.9 = 30.8M => 3.1M doses/day on average. Also doesn't seem likely. But if there were really big deliveries, it wouldn't be impossible. ******* Previous text: According to the CDC, as of 3/22/21, 82.8M people in the US have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations). Assuming a reporting lag of at most 1 week, the 7-day moving average of doses administered/day was at about 1.55M/day a week ago. It has generally been going up, as more doses become available. I can extrapolate the CDC vaccine administration curves to ~1.8M vaccines/day average for last week, ~2.1M vaccines/day average for the coming week, and ~2.4M vaccines/day for March 29-31, all with giant error bars that make these predictions difficult. Then total additional vaccines given by March 31 to be reported by April 7, 2021 = approx. (0.25M * 7) + (2.1M * 7) + (2.4M * 3) = ~23.7M more vaccines. Let's say in the ballpark of 50% of the people who will have had at least one vaccine dose will have had only one dose by March 31. An absolute lower bound on the number of people who have received at least one dose is today's figure of 82.8M. With the assumption of continuing trends as they are, a reasonable upper bound is 82.8M + 24M (if all subsequent doses went to people who have not received a first dose) = ~107M. Are these estimates reasonable given what we know about upcoming vaccine deliveries? Many locations have stated that the limiting factor in getting vaccines into arms has been the availability of vaccines rather than of distribution. Moderna, Pfizer and J&J plan to deliver a combined total of 240M cumulative doses by the end of March (https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/01/health/covid-vaccines-coming-when-trnd/index.html). Not all shots will be in arms by then. If they were all in arms by then, and ~50% had received only 1 dose, then 20M (J&J) + 220M*(2/3) (Pfizer/Moderna) = in the ballpark of 167M would have received at least one shot. How many vaccines have already been delivered? As of 3/22/21, 152.5 Pfizer/Moderna and 4.3M J&J (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations). it seems unlikely that Pfizer and Moderna will deliver a combined additional ~70M vaccines in the next ~10 days, or that J&J will deliver an additional ~16M. In any case, it seems unlikely that 86M additional vaccine doses could be administered in the next ~10 days (taking into account lags for reporting). A jump to 8M+ doses/day does not seem reasonable to me. A total of 124.0M Pfizer/Moderna and 2.4M J&J vaccines have been administered (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations). Administration always lags delivery, but not enormously. And as vaccination rates increase, the percentage that has received only one vaccination (Pfizer/Moderna) will also increase. J&J: 2.4M doses given, and ~1.85M delivered doses remain to be administered. Let's suppose, optimistically, that ~3M additional J&J doses are administered by 3/31. Then total J&J = ~5.4M. Below, approximations for Pfizer/Moderna: Pfizer: 63.7M doses given, 22.2M fully vaccinated, 19.4M with one dose only (30.5% of total administered), 41.5M with at least one dose (65.1% of total administered), and 13.3M delivered doses remain to be administered. Moderna: 63.7M doses given, 20.3M fully vaccinated, 19.6M with one dose only (30.8% of total administered), 40.0M with at least one dose (62.8% of total administered), and 15.2M delivered doses remain to be administered. Vaccination appointments in many (most?) places are made at most 1 week in advance. Then bumping up reporting for last week: add 0.2M * 7 * 0.64 = 0.90M additional people who have had at least one dose. Say 1.0M to include J&J. This week: Total Pfizer + Moderna doses on hand, according to the CDC, =~28.5M. ~2.1M/day (extrapolated) * 7 = 14.7M. Big gap. But, places are opening up large vaccination clinics. It's possible! If 2.1M/day, then 2.1M/day * 7 days * .64 (at least one dose) = 9.4M additional people who have had at least one dose. If 14.7M doses, then, say, 14.7 * .75 (at least one dose) = 11.0M (could be higher). So, 9.4M to, say, 12M additional people who have had at least one dose. Next week: Total Pfizer + Moderna on hand for 3 days could be, say, 6 to 10M. If 2.4M/day (Mon. to Wed.), then 2.4M/day * 3 days * .64 (at least one dose) = 4.6M additional people who have had at least one dose. If, say, 8M doses given, then, say, 8 * .75 (at least one dose) = 6M (could be higher). So, 4.6M to, say, 6M additional people who have had at least one dose. Total number of people who will have had at least one dose of vaccine by 3/31\n= 82.8M (reported 3/22) + 1.0M (adjustment for last week) + (9.4M to 12.0M for Pfizer/Moderna next week) + (4.6 to 6M for Pfizer/Moderna the last 3 days of March) + 3M (J&J)\n= 100.8M to 104.8M\n= ~101M to 105M I'll be surprised if fewer than 100M have had at least one dose by March 31.

The last week of February showed a gargantuan effort by the entire programme to 'catch up for lost time' and 'Total doses given' average over the last 2 weeks of February were similar to 'Total doses given' before the mid-February storm.\n-Note: the 'Vaccination Trends' tab provides an interesting look at weekly trends, including the 'Sunday slowdown' effect.
