Additionally, it makes sense. If you consider all parties to the right of Blue and White they do make up more than 50% of the Knesset.  c) It seem unlikely that anyone could sway him. Gantz has plummeted in the polls, so they are unlikely to walk out and call a new election and Bibi knows this. Gantz right now needs to wait out Bibi's term for political power. While there are a large number of democratic lawmakers opposed, few are willing to do more than finger wave.

Many settlers are allegedly opposed but Bibi can circumvent this by making it a limited annexation with a promise for further gains once COVID has been dealt with. Overall the evidence contains a lot of uncertainty but points to a measure calling for limited annexation of parts of the West Bank. I would be it will be below the 30% threshold. Things to look for when the map comes out are: Joe Biden's response, the White House response, Gantz's response, Europe's response, and the settler communities' response.
