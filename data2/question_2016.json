Hence, it was easier to do this from Lebanon\u2014with Hezbollah\u2019s coordination,\u201d said Maj. (res.) Tal Beeri, director of the research department at the Alma research center, which analyzes security threats to Israel emanating from Syria and Lebanon.\nAccording to Beeri, a former IDF intelligence officer specializing in the Lebanese and Syrian arenas, Hamas chose to fire from Lebanon for a number of reasons.\nThe first is that it has not been able to recover from the May conflict with Israel and did not want to draw Israeli fire towards Gaza. Hamas correctly assessed that Israel\u2019s retaliation in Lebanon would be significantly smaller in scale that in Gaza, said Beeri.\nThe Iraqi Qataib Hezbollah militia announced that it had joined the \u201cregional equation\u201d in June in the latest sign of a coordinated Iranian-led axis of radical entities operating against Israel.\nHamas in Gaza and Hamas in Lebanon tightly coordinate their activities, mainly through the terror organization\u2019s headquarters in Turkey, according to Beeri.\nA branch of that headquarters, known as the \u201cConstruction Bureau,\u201d is responsible for arming Hamas in Lebanon and ensuring that it has its own ability to activate weaponry.\nIt appears as if Hamas\u2019s gamble was well-calculated, judging by Israel\u2019s restrained reaction. Israel also seems reluctant to respond more forcefully in Lebanon at a time when the country is experiencing severe economic and humanitarian crises\u2014basically, sitting at the brink of collapse.\nA broader strategic consideration is Hamas\u2019s desire to implement, albeit symbolically, a new \u201cequation,\u201d announced by Hezbollah, according to which any perceived Israeli offensive activity near the Temple Mount will be answered with attacks.\nBeeri noted that in recent weeks, Iranian-backed Iraqi militias and Houthis in Yemen have pledged their allegiance to this same equation.'

Instead, they are used to regroup, resupply and rearm.  Hamas is a puppet organization of  radical/violent Islamists based out of Iran.  (I remember watching Hamas throwing political rivals off of rooftops while alive.)  So Israel is not dealing with a sane organization.  In one day, one week, one year or in one decade, the current cease fire will end and violence/fighting will resume.  There is far too much hate, mistrust and anger for a peaceful solution anytime soon!  In order to survive, Israel will be forced to take drastic actions and, for the record, they have the right to survive and protect themselves. The proper question to have asked is:  Will the current ceasefire result in a permanent peace in the next five years?  My answer is NO!

Another point is that both were characterized by a couple of incidents which one or other side could have claimed was a violation of the ceasefire (eg small rocket attacks) but I could find no evidence that they did.  Even in 2021 there has been one incident that could have been a ceasefire violation \"Gaza militants sent several incendiary balloons into Israel, causing 26 fires, and Israeli aircraft struck military posts in Gaza\" but there appears to have been no public accusations.  I started off thinking accusations of ceasefire violations are more likely than actual violations but in fact it looks now like a less likely event in that minor violations may be be pragmatically overlooked to maintain the ceasefire.  So given this I'm estimating that the ceasefire won't be broken within the time window, would have made probability even lower but for the fact that there still appears to be a pending case in the Israeli Supreme court of evictions from Sheikh Jarrah and Hamas has said that it would resume rocket attacks if the evictions go ahead.  That appears to be a likely outcome but I can find no recent information beyond early June on what has happened to this case and I'm not putting huge weight on the earlier Hamas declaration which was now some time ago.  So going for 35% for now based mostly on 2008 and 2014 information. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Israel%E2%80%93Palestine_crisis\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Israel%E2%80%93Hamas_ceasefire#:~:text=maintaining%20the%20ceasefire.-,Violations%20of%20the%20Hamas%2DIsrael%20agreement%20by%20other%20Gaza%20organisations,to%20abide%20by%20the%20truce.&text=Hamas%20imposed%20its%20will%20and,those%20who%20were%20firing%20rockets."], [86367, "2021-06-28T06:42:14Z", [0.58], ""], [29680, "2021-06-28T05:35:08Z", [0.3], ""], [95992, "2021-06-28T03:34:03Z", [0.48], "Passage of time"], [87897, "2021-06-28T01:56:29Z", [0.53], ""], [101623, "2021-06-27T22:53:05Z", [0.75], ""], [101622, "2021-06-27T15:24:46Z", [1.0], ""], [87897, "2021-06-27T13:02:01Z", [0.54], ""], [101333, "2021-06-27T07:55:45Z", [0.75], "Passage of time"], [96828, "2021-06-27T02:41:15Z", [0.4], ""], [95992, "2021-06-27T02:28:50Z", [0.5], "Passage of time.

The answer to this question is when?\nThis is not a recent issue.\nIn 1799 Napoleon consider the establishment of a Jewish State in the ancient lands of Israel. Benjamin Disraeli wrote a Zionist novel.  Moses Hess, friend and co-worker of Karl Marx, in 1862 declaring a Jewish State to be a necessity for humanity. In 1881 Leo Pinsker in response to the Russian pogroms appealed to Western European Jews to assist in the formation of a Jewish colony in Palestine. \nTheodor Herzl  produced a pamphlet in 1896 called the Jewish State and became the driver, organiser, propagandist behind the Zionist movement.\nIn 1917 the Balfour Declaration was the public pledge by Britain to establish a national home for the Jewish people as included in the terms of the British Mandate for Palestine as a result of the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire post WW1.\nThe pledge did include a caveat that \u2018 \u2018nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine\u2019 although the mandate was set up to facilitate self-rule by the Jewish people.\nThe horrors of Nazi Germany in WW2 cemented the need for a safe homeland for the Jewish people and wars and conflicts have occurred during the life of the establishment of Israel. In 2006 Hamas were victorious in a parliamentary election over Fatah and after a short-lived coalition government, split and took control of Gaza in 2007. This attracted the ire of the U.S. Israel and the EU who declared Hamas to be a terrorist organisation.\nThis can be explained by the aim of Hamas is to seek the destruction of Israel and deny its right to exist by establishing of an Islamic empire on its ruins.\nHamas is being used and supported, as a proxy, by Iran whose lawmakers have obligated their Government to initiate the destruction of Israel by 2040.\n\u2018Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called on Muslim states to support Palestinians militarily and financially and help rebuild Gaza after an 11-day conflict with Israel, Iranian media reported.\u2019  Before this latest conflict Netanyahu\u2019s political situation appeared to be precarious given that his opposition had been offered the chance to form a Government and so depriving him of the leadership role.\nGaining in this conflict, Netanyahu may emerge victorious. As in the past, Hamas have come to his rescue by justifying the hard right reactions by the Israeli forces to confront the Palestinian problem.\nThe current conflict escalated from an Israeli eviction of six Palestinian families ( resident since 1950), local rioting by both sides and clashes between Israeli police and Muslim worshippers at the Al-Aqsa mosque. This also a holy site for Jews who refer to it as the Temple Mount.\nHamas gave a deadline for the Israeli forces to withdraw which was ignored and prompted the initial rocket attacks.\nAfter the ceasefire Netanyahu said that Israel would respond forcefully to any attack and Ismail Haniyeh, Hama political leader said the fight would continue until the Mosque had been \u2018liberated\u2019. It is in Hamas\u2019s mandate to eradicate the State of Israel (supported by Iran) and it benefits Netanyahu to gain justification to respond in overwhelming fashion.\nTherefore, the probability of a new conflict is high and a violation of (any) ceasefire or accusation of one is likely. Neither side has any ambition to resolve the issues. https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2018/11/2/more-than-a-century-on-the-balfour-declaration-explained  https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-may-20-2021/  https://www.britannica.com/biography/Theodor-Herzl https://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/foreignpolicy/peace/guide/pages/declaration%20of%20establishment%20of%20state%20of%20israel.aspx  https://www.britannica.com/place/Gaza-Strip  https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/israel-palestine-conflict-hamas-represents-palestinians-1805303-2021-05-21  https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/05/18/hamas-wasnt-behind-jerusalem-protests-so-why-is-it-fighting/  https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/22/world/middleeast/netanyahu-israel-gaza.html  https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/hamas-doesn-t-want-a-palestinian-state#  https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/netanyahu-toughens-stand-as-tension-rises-between-israel-and-hamas-121052000176_1.html  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/21/palestinians-and-israelis-reflect-gaza-ceasefire  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/21/palestinians-return-to-damaged-homes-as-un-calls-for-gaza-dialogue  https://www.forbes.com/sites/joewalsh/2021/05/18/timeline-heres-how-long-gaza-israel-conflicts-usually-last---and-how-they-end/?sh=306ed7d38ce0  https://www.npr.org/2021/05/19/997989474/timeline-israel-hamas-fighting-takes-a-dire-toll-with-no-end-in-sight  https://www.dw.com/en/timeline-how-the-current-israel-hamas-conflict-has-expanded/a-57573511  https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-13331522  https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hamas.asp  https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-05-22/israel-hamas-war-in-gaza-showcased-iran-s-rocket-threat  https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/iran-s-zarif-speaks-with-hamas-chief-pledges-support/2236280\nhttps://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-hails-palestinian-victory-warns-deadly-blows-against-israel-2021-05-21/\nhttps://iranintl.com/en/iran-in-brief/proposed-bill-irans-parliament-calls-israels-destruction"], [45594, "2021-05-23T07:08:43Z", [0.5], ""], [45594, "2021-05-23T07:08:27Z", [0.0], "50"], [14266, "2021-05-23T01:49:59Z", [1.0], ""], [92079, "2021-05-23T01:47:45Z", [1.0], ""], [79142, "2021-05-22T23:24:54Z", [0.9], ""], [79142, "2021-05-22T23:24:19Z", [0.95], ""], [74903, "2021-05-22T23:01:42Z", [0.85], ""], [98516, "2021-05-22T23:01:35Z", [0.95], "Has any ceasefire in history NOT been violated?

Israel seems to tolerate some occasional rocket-fire from Gaza, probably recognizing that Hamas is not an organized military force that can control every member, and Hamas seems to have arrested those in Gaza violating the ceasefire in the past as a sign of commitment to a ceasefire.
