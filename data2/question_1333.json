Now Morales, 59, and his longstanding Vice President \u00c1lvaro Garc\u00eda Linera, 56, are on the ballot for a fourth term in 2019 on the Movement toward Socialism (MAS) ticket that would put them in office through 2025. The bid is a controversial one. Under the 2009 constitution, Morales is term-limited. Furthermore, he lost a 2016 referendum that would have allowed him to serve one more term. When he challenged that outcome in November 2017, Bolivia's Constitutional Court ruled that term limits themselves are unconstitutional, opening the door for his 2019 bid. Morales\u2019 best chance of victory is to win the October 20 general election outright. If he fails, his odds in a runoff against former President Carlos Mesa narrow. That said, it\u2019s not a given that supporters of third-place candidate \u00d3scar Ort\u00edz would shift to support Mesa in a second round.\n. . .\nMorales began his first term in 2006 under Bolivia\u2019s 1967 constitution. Then, the country passed a new Magna Carta in 2009, which \u201creset\u201d the counting of his terms but still limited the executive to two consecutive five-year terms. He began his first term under the new constitution in 2010 and his second in 2015. Also of note, the 2016 referendum was not a question on indefinite reelection but on allowing a third consecutive term. That said, the Constitutional Court\u2019s ruling said that any term limits were a restriction on human rights, which could allow for him to run indefinitely.\n~~~~~~~\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Bolivian_general_election The most recent polling has Morales at 34.4% and Mesa at 27.1%.  . . .with about 25% undecided\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  Morales was the first  indigenous person to be elected president of Bolivia.  He was widely regarded as not corrupt and a champion of the indigenous people.  Early on, he had the guts to refuse USAID $ and kick USAID out because (rightly, as it turned out) he thought that it was trying to encourage a coup (because he is a socialist and wasn't perceived to be sufficiently \"anti-drug\") and working to undermine the economy to spread discontent.

I think it is therefore 30% likely that corruption will have an impact on the electoral process at some point, either in outright bribery of officials, vote buying or some other form of corruption. I can also see why Morales will win, he is the incumbent and although less popular in recent years he still has a solid base of support from which to mobilise. However, other candidates voters may choose to back Mesa, the countries former president to spite Morales.
