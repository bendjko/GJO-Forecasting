If we use this to figure out what kind of gains would be needed to hit each of the bucket posts we get the following: $600 Billion / $572.914 Billion * 100 ~= 104.7% or about a 5% increase over 3 months.\n$850 Billion / $572.914 Billion * 100 ~= 148.4% or about a 48% increase over 3 months.\n$1.1 Trillion / $572.914 Billion * 100 ~= 192% or about a 92% increase over 3 months.\n$1.35 Trillion / $572.914 Billion * 100 ~= 235.6% or about 135% increase over 3 months. If we amortize the average index return (I will use 10% as an estimate for yearly Nasdaq returns for calculation purposes) over the 3 month period being discussed we get a benchmark index return of about 2.5% over 3 months. So therefore when establishing a base case if we were to assume average market returns for FB over the 3 month period we would expect the market cap to be ~$587 Billion dollars. This base case puts us just a little under the first post. This means any reason to think FB may do equal or worse than the index would put it in the lowest bucket, but any reason to think it should outperform should be thought of pushing the base case into the second bucket. To be able to justify pushing the outcome into the 3rd, 4th, or 5th bucket would require massive outperformance (with the stock needing to return at an annualized rate of ~192% to reach the 3rd bucket, ~368% to reach the 4th bucket, and ~540% to reach the 5th bucket). With all this being said, lets look at what we think may actually happen given the state of the market. Looking at the chart of FB we see it is currently in the middle of a massive drawdown reaching about 50% off it's ATH. By my estimation this is the result of a couple things: 1) Growing distrust about it's core FB product's business model (Slowing growth among youth, changes to iOS making ad targeting more difficult, a series of public backlashes about how it handles moderation and disinformation)\n2) Uncertainty around it's new 'Meta' ambitions (Appears to be a while until profitability with losses for years being directed into R&D, will this actually be the next big thing or just a passing fad?, etc)\n3) A general compression of multiples across the tech sector as people deleverage presumably in preparation for further rate hikes. Not directly related to FB, more of a market wide response to the threat of higher rates. While there are some execution questions about how the company will be able to pivot it's focus away from it's traditional flagship product to something new, I don't think any of these headwinds fundamentally change the outlook of the company. They still are still making massive amounts of profits that they are able to funnel back into the business and they are still able to attract and retain the type of talent to be able to support just about any ambitious R&D goals that they have. As these headwinds are processed and accepted by investors I would expect to see a regression towards the mean as investors start to see the company as a value play when compared to it's mega cap tech peers. The added possibility of a return to Mega tech equities generally adds to to the possibility of outperformance. Because of these reasons to expect reasonable but not other worldly outperformance I am making 2nd bucket my most likely case, with small (2%) chance of a reflexive reversal (Likely cause by derivative traders getting caught offside) that drives the stock way higher than expected, and a moderate (25%) chance of near index average returns or even losses if the situations prove more damaging longterm than I expect."], [691, "2022-03-01T17:38:13Z", [0.51, 0.48, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [13306, "2022-03-01T11:17:39Z", [0.6, 0.4, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [73687, "2022-03-01T10:03:19Z", [0.95, 0.03, 0.02, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2022-03-01T09:11:12Z", [0.6, 0.36, 0.04, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [97892, "2022-03-01T01:17:55Z", [0.33, 0.19, 0.18, 0.14, 0.16], ""], [102643, "2022-02-28T18:03:25Z", [0.4, 0.5, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2022-02-28T15:08:06Z", [0.59, 0.36, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [100653, "2022-02-28T14:36:33Z", [0.6, 0.35, 0.04, 0.0, 0.01], ""], [27661, "2022-02-28T11:01:41Z", [0.6, 0.4, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [21884, "2022-02-28T10:17:15Z", [0.3, 0.6, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2022-02-27T13:21:33Z", [0.58, 0.36, 0.06, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [104012, "2022-02-26T23:14:13Z", [0.25, 0.65, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0], "From current position - stock needs to rise more than 87% to reach market value over $1.1 Trillion.

I'll need to do mroe work to see if/when FB has rallied >20% in 5 months. With that said, I do think the smaller-cap, less profitable tech names will face the brunt of the selling, which could draw fund flows into FB, which is reasonably attractive on a relative valuation basis, so this could counter the macro \"sell tech\" sentiment.

For most of the last 4 months, Facebook's stock price has held steady around a mean of about 325 and 2.782b shares outstanding for a total market cap of 930.137b, where I'll assume it'll stay (the middle bucket) unless news breaks, which makes things pretty nice and simple. All things considered, history seems to indicate that Facebook's stock will go up. For the past three years, on average, it's gone up at a rate of about half a percentage point per week. If it were to continue to increase on trend, that would take the price up to about 1 trillion exactly. Over that time frame, the most Facebook's stock has ever fallen in a short time is by 30%, back when the lockdowns began. I think we can safely consider that a reasonable worst-case scenario for a news-based drop, at least at this early stage in the game. That would take us down to 234/share, or $651 billion. Dropping below $850b would mean The stock price dropping by 10%, or back down to about 300, which it almost touched earlier this week and which it saw as recently as August.

But even so, would it cause the stock to drop 36%? On the day the MSFT antitrust was decided MSFT was around $36. Its low was around $25 three months later, a 30% drop.
