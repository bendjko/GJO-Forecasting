If Italy crosses the 550K cases threshold without reaching the peak, it is really likely that it will cross the 1M line too, no matter the measures. The argument: 1) First wave was about 250K cases, peak around 26 to 27 of March, 80-90K cases at the peak: total wave approximately 2.8-3.1 times the number of cumulative cases at the peak. 2) Second wave: if we assume that it will have 2.5 times the number of cumulative cases at the peak, to be conservative, we need 300K second wave integrated cases at the peak, which makes 550K total cases if we combine them with the first wave. Right now we are at one week of reaching this point of no return and there has not been any national lockdown announced, only curfews and relatively weak measures at restaurants.

Combine this with Zipf's law and it is more probable than not that there will be at least 12 countries with 1M cases. Remove Brazil and the US, and we are left with 10.

It basically states that the relative importance of the n-th item of a list will be 1/n^a, with a some exponent. Here we will assume a = 1, which is the most common occurrence. Of course this is far from perfect, it breaks down after a certain n, and it can have notable exceptions (e.g. if we order counties by size, China and India break the law, but the rest of the countries do not; however if we order US cities by size, it works wonderfully well).

But the moment the #1 country reaches 15M cases, it becomes overwhelmingly probable (> 86% if we assume the 50% error is 1-sigma in a Gaussian distribution) that the #10 country will reach 1M. 2) The soft exponential growth in cases tell us that right now we have 32M cases, growing at a rate of 1.4-1.5M cases every five days, and with a slight increase of about 2-4% in every five day cycle (the five day cycle is a bad choice by my part). 2.a) Linear growth from there to the end of the year: 61M cases, top country at 20% of total cases (12M cases), assuming a 50% deviation from Zipf's, at least 8 countries with 1M+ cases. Thus the answer to the question will be 6, but more probably 7 or 8. 2.b) Soft exponential growth of a about 4% every five days: 76M cases, top country at 25% of total cases (19M cases), assuming no significant deviation from Zipf's law, about 18 to 19 countries with more than one million cases. Thus the answer to the question will be 16 or 17. 2.c) Of course, the key uncertainty is not the total cases at the end of the year, but how much we will deviate from Zipf's law and if the deviation will continue to be in the direction of concentrating cases in the most affected countries. Unfortunately owing to Murphy's law there are much more ways in which we can end up with 12+ countries with more than 1M cases than the contrary. Thus I will concentrate the bulk of the probability in the last bucket."], [67609, "2020-09-26T07:28:25Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.55, 0.45], ""], [1624, "2020-09-26T01:29:27Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.65, 0.25], ""], [27461, "2020-09-26T01:24:08Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.23, 0.77, 0.0], ""], [38094, "2020-09-25T23:08:38Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.25], "9/25 There are a dozen countries with greater than 400K cases and 11 with greater than 4K per DAY.

There's economic variables:  the ability/inability to afford adequate test kits and contact tracing; and the inability/ability of people to spend 2 weeks not working.  There's a certain subset of countries where there's funding for testing, but people cannot afford to isolate for 2 weeks; this subset of countries will drive up the number in this question. And there's human variables:  the willingness/unwillingness of people to believe experts/science, and  the willingness/unwillingness of people to follow best practice rules or laws.  I am reading more and more about people refusing to believe in the value of or comply with social distancing guidelines. Historically, pandemics hit in waves, with the 2nd wave worse than the first.  It seems to me that the 2nd wave is anticipated to hit this fall (as in the 1918-19 Flu pandemic).  So, it seems that even in places where COVID seems under control, there will probably be another surge in cases. Bottomline:  I think that the number of daily cases is going to continue to rise.  This rising tide will lift all boats, including ones that seem to be up on the shore.

And Abbott's, and others, $5 test is going to drive more testing. So, to just to illustrate the point. Iraq would be at 756480 using the linear projection used above. However, the current doubling rate in Iraq is every 35 days.[1]  Two doublings over 114 days would get it over the threshold. Same is true of the Philippines. Then, there are countries like Iran, Pakistan, and Bangladesh that are currently doubling at a rate of ~83 days. So, they don't look like they will make it into the million mark this year, but if doubling rate gets below 40, they very well could.

However, I think this 95% CI is much too confident so instead of assuming a standard deviation of 1 I've used a normal distribution calculator [2] to assume a standard deviation of 2.5 so that ~55% instead of 95% of the probability distribution falls in the 5.6-9.4 range, which sounds much more plausible given the large amount of uncertainty we have. The values I've assigned to each bin assumes a normal distribution using these values. Also note that I've also changed some of the probabilities I've assigned to individual countries based on some more reading I've done about their current situations.

Removing the US and Brazil, this gives us a floor of 6 to 7 countries, which allows me to remove the first two buckets and reduce the probability of the 4-6 bucket. More realistic scenarios (weekly new cases growing at a rate of 2 to 4% per week) would give between 60-80 Million cases, which simply increase considerably the probability of the two largest buckets. Assuming that the distribution slowly approaches a classical 1/n power-law distribution would also increase the largest buckets.

From 1) I can estimate that the top ten countries will have between 0.5-0.6 the total number of cases, with 0.2 for the top countrie. Since May the actual data have been 0.66-0.70 for the top ten and 0.26-0.31 for the top country in the list, with the numbers going doing (suggesting convergence). The distribution is not perfectly Zipf like, with the 10th country having between 1/11 and 1/12 the number of cases of the 1st country, yet this looks pretty good to me. Now if number of cases growth linearly, we will end up with about 40M cases at the end of the year, giving us about 7.9 countries with more than 1M cases (5.9 after removing US/Brazil). If we have a 1% growth per day (consistent below the growth we have had since May), we will end up with 100M cases and 19.9 countries expected to cross the 1M cases mark (17.9 after removing US/Brazil). If we allow for a 2% growth per day we will end with 330M cases, but I will not consider this scenario.

Current number of cases (how far from 1M are we at the half-way point this year)\n2. Strength of healthcare system\n3. Country wealth (indicates testing access and ability to social distance/avoid interaction and earn a living) Most likely to cross 1M in my mind are Russia and India. Both have high case loads at the moment (>360k) and weaker healthcare systems. They also are both heavily dependent on the service sector which involves in-person interaction. Less likely, but still concerning our countries like Peru, Chile, and Mexico. All 3 are on very steep parts of the exponential curve and have limited healthcare access  That being said, they are at <250k cases and this have farther to go.  Other factors that could influence my outlook higher are:\n1. A second wave of the virus in the fall. If it is very severe, that will obviously drive case counts up. I also don\u2019t believe lockdown restrictions will be as intense so case counts should rise faster\n2. The WHO shifts to some sort of estimation method based on longitudinal sampling of country populations  These two factors support increased risk on the upside. An interesting exercise would be to code the logistic regression I\u2019ve been using for other questions to see what results I get.  More to come.
