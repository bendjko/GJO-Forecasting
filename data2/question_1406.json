The top story is of course the first Normandy Four meeting in three years where Russian President Vladimir Putin met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for the first time in an attempt to reboot the Donbas peace process. And it was rebooted. The initial reactions this morning remain sceptical as all said and done not that much was achieved at the meeting. There is an agreement on a new POW swap, the non-contact area that underpins attempts at a real ceasefire has been expanded (three people were killed on December 9 as the leaders sat round that table), and some other bits and pieces like starting to remove landmines from no-man\u2019s land and better 24/7 monitoring of the situation. But the big questions on when and how elections will be held and when Ukraine\u2019s eastern border will be returned to Kyiv\u2019s control were put off until a new meeting slated for April. That will do. As I wrote yesterday there were fears going into the meeting that Zelenskiy would come out with nothing and that would cause him serious problems at home. Former president Petro Poroshenko was preparing to milk the situation for all its worth and there were demonstrations in Kyiv over the weekend from the \u201cno capitulation camp\u201d. From this perspective the meeting was a win for Zelenskiy as he took the low hanging fruit that give him the opportunities for more prime time telly when the POWs return just before the New Year\u2019s Eve holidays. (Eastern Europe doesn't really celebrate Christmas, or at least not until the \u201cold Christmas\u201d that falls in January, not December.) Observers remain sceptical that the new expanded ceasefire can be made to stick, but that is the point of having a peace conference: ceasefires fail because you are at war and when you make them stick you have peace. The difficult questions on the border and Donbas regional elections were put off to the New Year, but that plays to Zelenskiy\u2019s advantage too as he can claim to have made none of the concessions that many feared he would be forced to make. So the bottom line is Zelenskiy can defend his popular support. He remains in the game. The reform momentum he has built up \u2013 given a boost at the weekend by a new preliminary $5.5bn Extended Fund Facility (EFF) deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) \u2013 can be maintained. And he has four months for the foreign ministry diplomats to work on the much more difficult questions that remain on the agenda. Here France and Germany will play a crucial role. Given the relatively short amount of time officially allotted to the meetings yesterday \u2013 which looks more akin to a speed dating event than a summit \u2013 it is clear that a lot of work is going on behind the scenes, but the fact the meetings ran completely off agenda \u2013 the press conference was scheduled for 18:45 and actually happened at 23:00 \u2013 also shows that there was real substance discussed at the four-way meeting in the evening. Of course bringing the war to a complete end is going to be very difficult. And although Zelenskiy is very inexperienced, which showed clearly in the substance of the answers the four leaders gave at the press conference, it is also clear that Putin is facing a united front of France and Germany that have got Ukraine\u2019s back so he is facing a formidable counter-party, not a just an actor who has been thrown into the deep end. And that gives cause for hope, as German Chancellor Angela Merkel in particular excels at these sort of multi-faceted and difficult negotiations with lots of moving parts. In addition to our report on the Normandy Four meeting I also include a longer news analysis on a case that started the same day where Russia is trying to force Ukraine to meet its obligations on the $3bn Eurobond that former president Viktor Yanukovych bought in 2013 and the post-Maidan government then defaulted on. On this score things look less good. Ukraine is arguing that it is \u201codious debt\u201d which the country was forced to buy, and you don't have to pay that kind of debt back. However, the bond was bought long before Russia attacked Ukraine and while Yanukovych was still the legitimate president. If Ukraine is forced to return the money (a decision will be made in February) then that would take its reserves back under three months of import cover and would at a minimum lead to a devaluation of the hryvnia.
