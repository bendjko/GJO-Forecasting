According to a recently published article, SpaceX is taking action to limit the impact of the virus and therefore state that they are confident that their launch schedules would not be impacted. Although the company is confident, there are many uncertainties surrounding the virus, its impact on the economy, and how SpaceX will be impacted by it. However, I chose a percentage that was slightly higher because, as of today, President Trump announced that he would like to have the economy back up and running within two weeks (15-day plan) rather than in months. Because of that, there is now a slightly higher chance (75%) that SpaceX will not be severely impacted by the Coronavirus and therefore may meet its July 1st launch date. \n https://www.space.com/space-industry-coronavirus-spacex-1st-crewed-launch.html"], [172, "2020-03-24T19:28:14Z", [0.35], "Target May.

According to Bayes' Theorem, the probability of SpaceX failing to launch given the pandemic [P(a/b)] is equal to the probability that the coronavirus will delay a space organization's ability to operate [P(b/a)] times the probability of failing to launch a crewed orbit into space [P(a)] divided by the probability of a non-essential organization being affected by coronavirus [P(b)].  If the coronavirus was not a big deal right now, I would assume that it would take far longer than seven months for any organization to plan, construct and test a crewed capsule. Thus, while you could argue that there would have been a higher probability for SpaceX to launch its first crewed mission by July 2021, I'm going to give them a very optimistic 15% shot at BEST to launch a crewed mission under normal circumstances. This means that there is an 85% chance that SpaceX would fail to launch its first crewed mission by July 2020, giving us the P(a).   P(b), or the probability of non-essential organization being affected by Coronavirus will be measure using the map provided in the chart from here (https://www.cleveland.com/metro/2020/03/50-states-of-coronavirus-how-every-state-in-the-us-has-responded-to-the-pandemic.html) Since there are 50 states, meaning that every state is worth 2 percentage points, I decided that anything labelled red increases probability by 2% and orange increases probability by 1. With this logic, there is a 34% of a non-essential organization being affected by coronavirus. P(b/a) is the probability that COVID-19 will delay a space organization's ability to operate. The best way to understand this is by looking at where the launch facilities are and how badly affected they are. Looking at Space X's about page (https://www.spacex.com/about) its launch facilities are in Texas, California and Florida. Of these states, only California has been badly affected so far, meaning that this is a 33% chance of delay. Thus, by plugging this information into Bayes Theorem, we find that the probability of SpaceX failing to launch \"Crew Dragon\" given the coronavirus pandemic [P(a/b)] = (.33x.15)/.34 or an 82.5%, rounded up to 83%, chance of SpaceX failing to launch its first crewed mission by the July 2020 deadline.

In order to assess the possibility of this mission launching before 1 July 2020, multiple factors need to be considered. First and foremost is the status of the launch site and the current and future impact of the COVID-19 spread. Currently, Brevard county has reported its first presumptive COVID-19 infection [2]. It seems likely that there will be an increase in COVID-19 infections across florida, and Brevard county and Gov DeSantis just ordered all bars and nightclubs closed and imposed crows limits at beaches and restaurants [3]. Along with Brevard county, we must look at the response that Cape Canaveral Air Force Station is taking. Currently, they are still conducting launch operations, but they have gone to HPCON BRAVO [4], which means all Service members should avoid contact with others, avoid unnecessary travel, have 14 days worth of supplies, and prepare for travel restrictions and cancellations of group events [5]. the 45th Space Wing is meeting today to discuss launch plans in regards to the COVID-19 outbreak [6]. Further, the Secretary of Defense has placed strict travel restrictions on DoD members and their families that continues through 11 May 2020 [7]. This is important because it shows that the US military believes this outbreak will last longer than 2-4 weeks. The next step is to analyze is the SpaceX response to the COVID-19 outbreak. 6 days ago the company's President stated that they remain optimistic about the launch occurring in May [8]. However, there have not been any updates (in regards to the launch) since that one and much has chanced in the world in the last 6 days. One concern that could impact the timing of the launch is the health of the two astronauts that will be manning the mission. NASA does institute a 14-day health quarantine for any space travelers before they launch and both astronauts are currently training as if the mission will occur in May [9]. However, if the mission is unable to launch in May, due to COVID-19 restrictions, there would still be time for the launch to occur before 1 July 2020. it is important to note that President Trump did state that effects from COVID-19 could impact the United States through the July/August time frame [10]. Taking into consideration the current restrictions and future restrictions, it seems likely that the Air Force, Space Force, NASA and SpaceX will have protocols in place to ensure a launch occurs. Unless something unexpected happens, there should be a large enough window between 7 May 20 and 1 July 20 for SpaceX to launch its mission. Therefore, I assess that there is an 88% possibility that SpaceX will launch its crewed mission before 1 July 2020.  This prediction will most likely change weekly as the impacts of COVID-19 become more clear. Please point out/correct any incorrect statements/analysis/assessments I have made.

Now SpaceX will begin its work with the new Dragon 2 capsule which will be used to send people to the international space station. I suggest a 1% chance SpaceX will launch before July 1st this year, which is significantly lower than my previous prediction. Why? \nAxiom Space, \u201ca company with ambitions to develop a private space station, announced March 5 that it has signed a contract with SpaceX for a commercial Crew Dragon mission to the International Space Station. Axiom said the mission, scheduled for launch no earlier than the second half of 2021, will carry one Axiom professional astronaut and three private astronauts to the ISS. The mission will last 10 days, including eight at the station and two in transit. The company did not disclose terms of the deal, nor pricing for the individual private astronauts. The flight announcement comes as Axiom works to raise outside investment. Suffredini said in that earlier interview that the company is in the process of raising a Series A funding round on the order of $100 million, which it hopes to close by the beginning of summer.\nThe contract is the second deal for a commercial Crew Dragon mission announced in less than a month. Space Adventures announced Feb. 18 it had an agreement for a Crew Dragon mission launching between late 2021 and the middle of 2022. That flight, carrying four private astronauts, will not go to the ISS but instead fly in an orbit more than twice as high as the station. \u201cThanks to Axiom and their support from NASA, privately crewed missions will have unprecedented access to the space station, furthering the commercialization of space and helping usher in a new era of human exploration,\u201d SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said in the Axiom statement\u201d. https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/7/21167696/spacex-dragon-1-cargo-capsule-nasa-international-space-station-falcon-9\nhttps://spacenews.com/axiom-to-fly-crew-dragon-mission-to-the-space-station/\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/axiom-space-pitches-its-first-10-day-all-inclusive-trip-to-the-iss-for-just-55-million/\n"], [85919, "2020-03-08T19:27:49Z", [0.32], "The rocket has arrived at the launch site and they are aiming to go ahead on the 7th May.

SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule arrived on Florida's Space Coast on Thursday (Feb. 13), and now Technicians can start prepping the vehicle for the launch that will kick off Demo-2, a test mission that will send NASA astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken to the International Space Station (ISS). SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule aced an in-flight abort test Sunday morning (Jan. 19), successfully jetting away from its Falcon 9 rocket less than 90 seconds after liftoff and demonstrated the spacecraft's ability to keep astronauts safe in the event of a launch emergency, marking a big step on the path toward crewed flight. In terms of the astronauts capabilities, Behnken and Hurley have been working closely with SpaceX on the Crew Dragon's development since 2015, so they're well equipped to fly the spacecraft. In total, the two astronauts have worked together for two decades. As of 17 February 2020, Falcon 9 has achieved 82 out of 84 full mission successes (97.6%), so it is sound to say they have a dependable record regarding safety and mission performance. There is still major caution around this launch, and Bridenstine was quick to add that the new timeline could slip again and that \u201cWe need more realism built in to our development time frames\u201d, when asked how soon he the capsule would be ready to fly astronauts into orbit. He also said \u201cWe are not going to take any undue risk,\u201d he said, standing beside Musk and the two astronauts slated to fly aboard the Crew Dragon - Doug Hurley and Bob Benkoe. Musk also noted \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty arduous engineering job to get the parachutes right,\u201d highlighting that Crew Dragon\u2019s parachutes will be at least twice as safe as those used during NASA\u2019s Apollo moon missions. \nhttps://www.space.com/spacex-crew-dragon-launch-site-arrival-demo-2.html\nhttps://www.space.com/spacex-crew-dragon-astronaut-launch-by-spring-2020.html\nhttps://www.sciencealert.com/these-are-the-first-2-astronauts-who-will-fly-on-spacex-s-historic-crew-dragon\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-space-exploration-spacex/nasa-aims-for-first-manned-spacex-mission-in-first-quarter-2020-idUSKBN1WP1CS\nhttps://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2020-01-19/spacex-to-try-rocket-failure-test-again-after-bad-weather-delay\n"], [80587, "2020-03-02T01:14:01Z", [1.0], "As of 17 February 2020, Falcon 9 has achieved 82 out of 84 full mission successes (97.6%). According to the wiki, SpaceX will test the Flacon Heavy (based on Falcon 9)  Merlin engines prior to flight, so we will know by late April or early-May if it passes the preflight tests. My first estimate is therefore based on SpaceX's success rate. My only thought will be the non-launch related impact of Covid-19 on the launch facility staffing and space program. I would expect the crew and back up will be put into preventative isolation for up to six weeks before launch. If the launch facility is closed because of it, however, there will be no flight. Therefore the only revision to my estimate will be based on Covid-19 pervasiveness, and not Space X's ability to conduct the mission.
