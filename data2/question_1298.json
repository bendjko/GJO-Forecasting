Brent closed today at $62.42.** There are 51 trading days between now and December 6. In order to determine the base rate, I pulled all closing prices for Brent for the last 20 years (actually, almost 20 years--I went back to January 2000). We have 4,928 unique data points of closing prices followed by 50 additional closing prices (I used 50 instead of 51 because I went with a round number and I thought I might be writing this tomorrow). In 900 of those, or 18.3%, was there at least one closing price greater than 20.2% higher than the original closing price in the next 50 trading days. 20.2% is how much brent would have to rise in order to close above $75. So the only question now is whether we should use any number different than the base rate. I argue that if we do, it should be pretty close to the base rate given that the oil market is a pretty deep and motivated crowd-sourced assessment of the value of oil, and at least theoretically, all information about the future is incorporated. Today's closing price certainly reflects all the news that has streamed out over the last 11 days regarding the attack on the Abqaiq facility in Saudi Arabia.  I will assign a probability very slightly above the the base rate for 3 reasons: (1) In spite of the lackluster price action in brent oil since the attack, the market is showing signs of tightness, predominantly in brent time spreads. This indicates the market may be more vulnerable than normal to further supply disruptions. (2) From a geopolitical standpoint, it seems that Iran's next move would be to strike at Saudi Arabia's oil infrastructure again, a probability that may not be fully appreciated by oil market participants. Iran has previously said that if it is not free to export oil no one else in OPEC should be, and it indicated that considers the sanctions an act of war. Over the summer Iran attacked an oil tanker, shot down a US drone, and escalated its nuclear program. The attack on Abqaiq was just one incident in a pattern of aggression. Geopolitical logic would indicate that this pattern will continue until either there is a military response or Iran gets what it wants, which is a lifting of the sanctions. Since neither of the two seems likely near term, the base case next move is another incident in the pattern. (3) I acknowledge there are actually 51 trading days before the deadline, not 50 as in my base rate calculation. These three arguments are slightly offset by the current tepid level of demand for brent. The Global PMIs have been in a falling pattern throughout the last year and half or so, and much of Europe and Asia is in contraction territory. A weak economy translates into weak demand for crude oil. All else equal, it is less likely that a spike in oil prices will occur during a weak economic environment.  Thus, I assign a 19% probability, only slightly higher than my calculated base rate.

All of these factors have relatively constant since then, which is why oil prices have been historically low. In the past 5 years (~1825 days), oil prices have exceeded $75 for ~187 days, which is ~10% of the days of this 5-year time period [2].  In the past 1 year (~365 days), oil prices have exceeded $75 for ~45 days, which is ~12% of the days of this 1-year time period. There are 77 days between today (9/20) and 12/6. The closing price only has to exceed $75 ONCE for the answer to this question to be yes. We can't extrapolate much from the 5-year or 1-year historical averages for the next 77 days since the Brent oil price each day is not independent of other days, but this does inform us that exceeding $75 is quite likely, especially if oil prices are volatile - which they are now given the recent attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil infrastructure. Analysts say that SA can mask the dramatic drop in oil production by releasing its reserves, but that if repairs take longer than ~6 weeks then oil prices are very likely to rise above $75 [3,4].  Of course, the long-term trend is slowing global growth - which lowers oil prices - but political volatility in the short-term will make-or-break this question. Given high tensions, a lot in the geopolitical realm can happen between now and 12/6 that will spook markets, which is why I'm assigning this a pretty high probability of 70%.

That being said, demand is lower in the winter months which could cause prices to fall. EIA forecast is for $61.  To set my base rate, I started in 2015 - the year that shale drilling took off in such dramatic fashion that the US achieved an unprecedented level of energy independence and an effective cap on prices was set. Since 2015, daily prices have exceeded $75 on 6% of the days. Post-Nov, 2018 might be better because that is when Trump re-instated sanctions against Iran. However, oil has not exceeded $75 in that period and was only over $74 three times.  As a result, the only factors pushing Brent prices up to seemingly unprecedented levels are a surge in global growth expectations (likely due to progress on US-China trade) or a conflict in the Middle East. Simple technical analysis (avg price this week/avg price since June) suggests a geopolitical risk premium of 10% and I think this is mostly priced in.  I put the probability of a sufficiently large conflict in the Middle East and a resolution to the trade war before December 6th at 20% and 10% respectively.
