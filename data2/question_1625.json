From my point of view, there are two mechanisms at work determining the position of a country in the index. 1) The performance of the country of interest\n2) The performance of competing countries Both of them are driven by the performance in the sub-indices that are used to calculate the overall index. So let's take a look at them and what they are ought to measure [8]. I. Affordability, includes:\n- change in average food costs\n- proportion of population under global poverty line\n- GDP per capita\n- agricultural import tariffs\n- presence of food safety-net programmes (presence, funding, coverage, operation)\n- access to financing for farmers II. Availability\n- sufficiency of supply\n- public expenditure on agricultural R&D\n- agricultural infrastructure\n- volatility of agricultural production\n- political stability risk\n- corruption\n- urban absorption capacity\n- food loss III. Quality & Safety\n- dietary diversity\n- nutritional standards (dietary guidelines, national plan/strategy, monitoring and surveillance)\n- micronutrient availability (vitamin A, iron, zinc)\n- protein quality\n- food safety (food surveillance agency, access to potable water, ability to store food safely) IV. Natural Resources & Resilience\n- exposure (environmental factors such as temperature rise, drought; commitment to managing exposure)\n- water (agricultural water risk)\n- land (degradation, grassland, forest change)\n- oceans (eutrophication, biodiversity, marine protected areas)\n- sensitivity (import dependency, dependence on natural capital, disaster risk management)\n- adaptive capacity (early warning measures, national agricultural risk management system)\n- demographic stress (population growth, urbanisation) The UAE performs well regarding affordability (4th rank), comparably well on availability (39th rank) and on Quality & Safety (26th rank), and abysmal on Natural Resources & Resilience (106th ranks). Potential for improvement is certainly in those areas that are able to adjust in the short term.  Judging from the media coverage [2,3,4,5], the UAE may focus on some parts that would fall into this category such as food surveillance [2]. It also seems like that they are actively working on achieving goals that contribute to their position in the Food Security Index [3]. More information on the Food Security Council [6,7]. In the next forecast, I'll take a closer look at the direct competitors: Japan and Italy.
