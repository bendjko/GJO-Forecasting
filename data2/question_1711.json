Judging by this report - https://bit.ly/3kHqFzb - it appears that a Senator a Representative have written to CDC and requested the reimplementation of the no sail order.  @Anneinak Further to my last forecast of 20201112, Carnival has cancelled all US sailings until 31 December 2020, see https://bit.ly/35ulv4R, and hence my revised forecast.  My revision with a 5% allocation prior to 15 January 2021 is based on\ni) Carnival Cruise LIne still lists 10 sailings that could take place prior to January 15, 2021. See https://bit.ly/3njXC68\nii) I am assuming that a 'mock' voyage to comply with CDC's conditional sailing order would in fact comply with the question as it is written.

The word 'conditional' belies some of the factors, more accurately explained here: https://bit.ly/3kV0HZU and here https://bit.ly/3kS8cRe . The requirement to apply for the \"Conditional Sailing Certificate at least 60 days before they want to resume sailing\" effectively pushing possible sailings by Carnival to at least 2 Jan 2021 as of today.  Carnival's Aida has suspended sailings in Europe for the month of November due to increasing coronavirus outbreaks. This will simply add to the company's cash flow problems and may pressure Carnival Cruise Line to consider sailings from Continental US sooner rather than later. However, Judge Seitz's court order (see below) and the CDC's new requirements make it difficult to see how the company can resume commercial sailings from continental US any time soon.  One important  aspect to the question \"When will a Carnival Cruise Line cruise next depart from the continental U.S.?\" is to define what is meant by the question. In the strictest of interpretations, a mock cruise as defined by the new CDC requirements would answer the question in the affirmative. Thus, in this case, I have left my current forecast as is because that is a real possibility. @Anneinak; do you have any views on this changed scenario? Updated 20201027 The CDC recently issued a Level 3 Warning to US citizens to avoid non essential travel by boat / cruise ship. See https://bit.ly/34xScyb. This is noteworthy simply because it is unusual for CDC to issue warnings for a specific transport type. Cruise ships and boats in this case. Carnival Cruise Line has the additional burden of complying with the Southern District of Florida Court Order issued by Judge Patricia Seitz on 21 October 2020. This relates to the Probation Order given by the court for environmental pollution transgressions in 2017 & 2018. See https://bit.ly/34yuBxm. In brief, 30 days notice should be given to the court prior to a Carnival Corp ship entering US waters and a certificate of compliance with the probation order must be submitted by the CEO. There is some leeway for Carnival in the order in that a company vessel \"that anticipates entering U.S. Waters before December 31, 2020, the Company shall immediately notify the Interested Parties, CAM, and TPA,and shall provide the information required by this Order no less than 7 days after the date of entry.\" See also https://bit.ly/34vf0OX @Anneinak : The shrinking patch of high ground is getting smaller!

Updated 20200922 Carnival is terminating or not renewing contracts of up to 7,000 staff which, in the 2020 staff reductions, will amount to > 20% of its workforce. The company's cash burn is considerable and one wonders if the company can survive should the CDC not lift the 'no sail' order on 30 Sept. See https://bit.ly/3hRcs16 Updated 20200921: Carnival Cruise Line has increased the number of ships it is selling from 14 to 18. It cites cash flow, operating efficiencies and health and safety as being the reasons. Equally, further cancellations / postponements by both Carnival and other cruise lines have been announced (See https://youtu.be/dvAaRTnGW1U). Three Carnival cruises have been postponed from Miami, Tampa and new Orleans until March 13, March 19 and Apr 29 respectively, i.e. after the period of this forecast. Senators R Scott & M Rubio have introduced the Set Safely Sail Act on 20200916  in an effort move forward the resumption of cruising from continental USA. (See https://bit.ly/3kBeqUV). Whether this Act will move through the system rapidly is yet to be soon. It is also questionable whether it will be processed before the CDC's moratorium date of 30 September and if so, whether it could bypass the CDC ruling. However, bearing in mind that all members of the Cruise Lines International, of which Carnival is a member, have voluntarily suspended cruising ex USA until 31 October 2020, the Set Sail Safely Bill may still have some impact on the resumption of cruising from continental USA. Updated 20200912 The following article, https://bit.ly/2Rkk5SP, shows the leading cruise lines are putting pressure in Miami-Dade to restart the industry. My earlier rationale below is still applicable. However, my 5% forecast for the 24 Nov 2020 - 15 Jan 2021 period holds for the moment but may be revised should this look the more likely time frame. Updated 20200911 Further to my forecasts below, a factor in my rationale has been the likely reticence of potential paying passengers from booking cruises until they feel safe in the environment, both on ship, getting to the ship and the general environment. This appears to be confirmed in recent spending studies done in Europe and USA. See https://reut.rs/33lM5uO Par 7 which indicates that higher income people are not spending freely. Cruise lines draw most of the paying passengers from higher income groups. Thus, lack of bookings in addition to health, transport, regulatory and logistics challenges make it unlikely  cruises from continental USA will depart before 16 January 2021.  Updated 20200909: One aspect previously mentioned in my forecasts has been the unlikelihood of paying passengers booking cruises with the period of this forecast simply because of concerns over health and the history of cruise ships being infected by covid-19 in the early stages of the global pandemic. Undoubtedly cruise line companies, Carnival Line included, have been hoping for is the early arrival of a vaccine. However, in the light of the media coverage recently regarding pharma companies a) pledging to ensure safety and b) the potentially severe reaction of an intrial patient on the AstraZenica - Oxford Univerity Phase 3 trial (see BBC https://bit.ly/342xeHO), potentially paying passengers are likely to take a more hesitant wait and see approach prior to booking a cruise. Additionally, once a vaccine is available, how quickly can potentially paying passengers get vaccinated and how quickly can cruise lines get crews vaccinated? This will be another limitation in the period of this forecast. Further to my forecasts of July 27, Aug 23 & 28, my changed forecast is the result of:\na) CDC has issued a further moratorium on cruising until Sept 31; CDC has called for public comment on reopening the industry; See https://bit.ly/2ZwosOZ. This closes on 20200921, barely a week before the current suspension ends. As of 20200912, > 3750 submissions have been made. Is it possible CDC will assess, check verify all these and make a decision to restart the industry in a week? Unlikely in my view.  \nb) amended CDC rules for cruise ship crews and the repatriation of crews to home countries has caused most cruise companies to withdraw ships from USA waters in order to repatriate crews and enable crews to avoid what in effect is quartanting in their cabin on board the ships\nc) in addition to repatriating crews, cruise line companies, Carnival included, needed 'storage' for ships and / or maintenance. This was cheaper in European waters or elsewhere.\nd) in the light b) & c), the number of cruise ships has fallen from around 120 in Feb 2020 cruising or located  to USA waters to around 30 in Aug 2020. According to a report on 10 Aug 2020, Carnival confirmed that none of its 90 ships are in USA waters at present.  See https://bit.ly/3hRju6U from Forbes. See https://bit.ly/2EUmIIc and https://hrld.us/34OUtFz (Miami Herald)  On 27 Aug 2020, CDC issued an update advising people to defer travel on cruise ships (https://bit.ly/3gLf543).  In the light of the above, the fact Carnival Cruise Line has no ships currently in USA waters, the apparent increase in covid 19 cases in many parts of the world in the recent weeks, the imminent arrival of winter, the tropical storms in and around the USA continent, I do not see a huge demand for cruising from the target market before 16 January 2021, a mere four and half months away. An additional factor cruise operators, including Carnival, take cognisance of is that air travel is extremely limited currently and may stay that way for some time. This makes it either impossible or very dificult, expensive and inconvenient for many potential paying passengers to meet ships or return home from cruises. As of the time of writing, Carnival released a press release cancelling cruises for its Princess Lines , including the Island Princess early 2021 sailngs from continental USA.

Right now we see a surge in cases, especially Florida which is a popular departure location. Such a reduction may occur in a month or two (October) or the autumn weather might even bring a second wave of pandemic, thus delaying the cruise industry restart.

I assign the same probability to that.\n- finally, consumer confidence has to have returned to confining themselves in cruise ships. We are talking about relatively wealthy retirees. They will take their time to accept to take this risk. This means that with even a 40% capacity, the cruise ship is unlikely to be economic to sail.
