The article is incredibly chatty, but does give a few new insights:\n- Laschet much more likely than I thought\n- Virtual meeting unlikely if Covid returns\n- \"Someone else\" probably a nonstarter by now if we conclude in 2020 at all\nThe translation is by Google Translate with a few manual adjustments made where Southern German dialect did not go through as expected. Who will succeed Kramp-Karrenbauer? The difficult search for a new boss for the CDU Angela Merkel retires as Federal Chancellor, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer as CDU chairwoman. Three men apply for their successor. But do they also have the format for the candidacy for chancellor? There is growing nervousness within the party that, like two years ago, there could be a close result that does not satisfy the party. He is back. For months, Friedrich Merz was practically doomed to do nothing. In spring, the 64-year-old Sauerland wanted to travel through the republic and advertise at the CDU base from the Black Forest to Sylt for his candidacy for the CDU chairmanship. But then came the corona virus. First the special party conference planned for the end of April was canceled, then Merz even became infected with the virus and had to be quarantined at home.\nThe rulers are in the spotlight The public attention belonged to others. The rulers who have the power and the associated apparatus and are therefore in the public spotlight. In the face of the pandemic, his main competitor to succeed Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the North Rhine-Westphalian Prime Minister Armin Laschet, was able to distinguish himself as a crisis manager, doer and caretaker with Health Minister Jens Spahn. At the same time, the Bavarian Prime Minister and CSU boss Markus S\u00f6der passed all CDU colleagues in the polls and positioned himself as the favorite for the Union's candidacy for chancellor. Merz, on the other hand, without an office or mandate in the CDU, stood on the edge of the stage and could only watch.\nMerz shows his strengths as a speaker But the former Union parliamentary group leader is not thinking of giving up. There is still a lot of time until the election party conference at the beginning of December - and Merz is determined to use it for himself. He has recently been traveling through the country again and shows his strengths as a speaker at public appearances. In his view, the fact that he has neither a government position nor government experience is not a disadvantage. \u201cI can operate machines,\u201d he says confidently. He categorically rejects the demand of the Schleswig-Holstein Prime Minister Daniel G\u00fcnther that the three candidates for the CDU chairmanship - Armin Laschet, Friedrich Merz and Norbert R\u00f6ttgen - should get together and agree on a candidate for a \"fight vote\" to avoid the party congress. That would have a taste of \"backroom dealing,\" he says. \"We are not in the DDR (former East Germany).\" Southwest CDU rejects the demand for a consensus candidate Criticism of G\u00fcnther's approach also comes from the strong southwest CDU: \"We have several strong candidates for the CDU party chairmanship and the candidacy for chancellor, all of whom have proven that they can take responsibility on the front line,\" says the influential CDU Group leader in the Stuttgart state parliament, Wolfgang Reinhart, opposite the BNN. \"The other parties envy us this personnel situation.\" The timetable must be adhered to. The CDU now needs a clear order.\nWolfgang Reinhart, CDU parliamentary group leader in Stuttgart The head of the CDU North Baden, Minister of Agriculture Peter Hauk, blows in the same direction: \"An election involves having a choice, that is the basic principle of democracy,\" he told our newspaper.\nPeter Hauk rejects a virtual party conference The Southwest CDU firmly rejects the attempt by party friends to postpone the party congress and not elect the new party leader until next year. \u201cThe timetable must be adhered to,\u201d says Reinhart. The elections would have to take place at the party congress in Stuttgart. \"The CDU now needs a clear order.\" Hauk thinks nothing of a virtual party conference, as promoted by JU boss Tilman Kuban. To do this, the statutes must first be changed - and that can only happen at a regular party conference. \u201cWe have to hold the party congress in accordance with the corona. That demands concessions from everyone involved, but we will have to live with that. \" A certain nervousness in the ranks of the Christian Democrats cannot be overlooked. After the SPD surprisingly proclaimed Vice Chancellor and Finance Minister Olaf Scholz as Chancellor candidate and FDP party leader Christian Lindner elected the purely Palatinate Economics Minister Volker Wissing as the new General Secretary, the CDU is concerned that the open and unresolved personnel issues will all the others by December Overlay topics. The outgoing chairwoman Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer is already warning of a \"ruinous competition\" between the three candidates. \"We are not allowed to look around for four months while others have long since clarified their personnel issues\" And here the link to the Sep 7th article:\nhttps://bnn.de/nachrichten/politik/die-schwere-suche-nach-einem-neuen-chef-fuer-die-cdu"], [58028, "2020-09-09T07:52:11Z", [0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0.2, 0.2], ""], [13306, "2020-09-09T05:25:18Z", [0.11, 0.24, 0.0, 0.45, 0.2], "Comment deleted on Sep 09, 2020 10:30AM UTC"], [60948, "2020-09-08T21:34:03Z", [0.33, 0.33, 0.04, 0.2, 0.1], ""], [88766, "2020-09-08T08:26:18Z", [0.45, 0.55, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [87691, "2020-09-08T03:39:02Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [87064, "2020-09-07T16:17:57Z", [0.4, 0.5, 0.0, 0.05, 0.05], ""], [80764, "2020-09-07T12:51:11Z", [0.36, 0.36, 0.02, 0.2, 0.06], "Laschet today: \"Spahn will support me\". http://www.dtoday.de/startseite/politik_artikel,-Laschet-sieht-viel-Zuspruch-zu-seinen-Plaenen-fuer-den-CDU-Vorsitz-_arid,743960.html"], [88766, "2020-09-06T13:20:30Z", [0.25, 0.45, 0.0, 0.3, 0.0], ""], [45594, "2020-09-06T11:13:24Z", [0.3, 0.15, 0.05, 0.3, 0.2], ""], [60948, "2020-09-05T23:22:23Z", [0.3, 0.3, 0.1, 0.25, 0.05], "R\u00f6ttgen back in the race.

Negotiations for necessary changes in German party law (that currently prevent virtual congresses from being recognized as such) have started, so I exclude the option of another postponement or cancellation from now on.\nArmin Laschet (CDU, Northrhine-Westphalia MP) was recently visited by Angela Merkel in his state, which was reminiscent of Merkel's visit to Markus S\u00f6der and his state government in mid-July. He showed her the remains of the industrial heritage of the Ruhrgebiet (e.g. Zeche Zollverein in the city of Essen) instead of baroque gilden castles, which may point to his intention to be more eligible to work class and middle class-people.

Is there any polling of voting party members for the leadership? Or is it mostly about reading the tea leaves and sensing which way the wind is blowing?\n2. Soeder seemed to be saying, from the articles I read, \"no\" out of one side of his mouth, and \"yes\" out of the other for moving to national politics and out of Bavaria. Is that common behavior for Germany politicians? Or is Soeder particularly odd for keeping his options open?\" I find these comments quite illuminating and comprehensive: https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1069820 First, there are couple of gallup institutes in Germany which ask about sympathy for politicians, and in the past 20 years the political field has undergone much field research from a marketing perspective. Sentiments seem overwhelmingly important for political decisions, sometimes I get the impression the effect on voters from their doing is the only category in which politicians are able to think today. However, from my personal view I don't like sentiment-based politics, because it complicates rational decision-making, and frequently \"necessities\" are left out, even though they're basic, just because they're unpopular.\nOn the other hand, ownership of the gallup institutes makes them suspect to a biased view, and to trying to manipulate voters in a way (by making false claims), it is easy to get the desired result by design of the question. Then it is also questionable, whether some of the polls are representative, since the numbers of people asked are usually small and there's no disclosure about who (geographically, urban or rural, age groups...) is asked, and I doubt there is no bias to it, too, depending on the respective question and on who pays for the study.\nHowever, there is the ZDF-Politbarometer, which is frequently cited, and which should be independent enough (as ZDF is viewer funded public TV channel), with a slight leaning towards conservatism. It has a monthly review of sentiment towards the ten \"most important\" politicians by the time, here's the June publication https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/1817/umfrage/noten-fuer-spitzenpolitiker/#professional You should know, there is some arbitrary decision in the question \"who is important\", since e.g. Lindner (FDP) has no function at all except being the party leader of a small opposition party, about which it is not certain they will clear the 5%-hurdle to become members of the next Bundestag at all. It seems a bit of a tradition that they are mentioned in this poll... On the other hand, there is Habeck (Green party), who has no function either at the moment, but who is the flagship of the Green party (~19%) and is likely to become their next candidate for chancellorship, if they decide to have one at all.\nMerz isn't in it, because he is not a politician at all at the moment, which I support, but his potential importance due to our overall question as above, he should be polled somehow, too. Then there's the phenomenon that usually the chancellor and finance minister (who is vice-chancellor at the same time by tradition) are rated best, but I suspect this is only due to folks who aren't exposed to politics or aren't really interested in respond like that just because it is the few names they recognize at all. Publicity makes popularity (that's why all ambitious politicians fear nothing more than not being in the news somehow).\nIt is a rare picture that most top ten politicians have a positive overall sentiment (maybe due to crisis management in the pandemic) except Lindner, who has the fame of being a snooty-nosed little upstart.\nIf you trust ZDF-Politbarometer, then S\u00f6der will become the next candidate for the Union, and also will become chancellor. The SPD is likely not to announce a head candidate at all, since it would be unrealistic to think about their chancellorship at all with their current polls (14 to15%) in mind. But maybe, in times of wonder, the German population will realize how large a share in their current well-being the SPD has, and polls will change, I don't know. That is why these polls tend to be a narrative or a constructed reality, imho, as long as there is not a real voting situation.\nThere may also be polls about this special issue of CDU leadership, but there is none that I know or can recommend right now; it may be more visible in the news the closer we get to the actual voting \"Parteitag\", which seems to be in Stuttgart in December as of today. Here's a platform for German topics with embedded surveys on other media, which seems to be interesting and which I discovered just today. However, there's no guarantee they're impartial or unbiased: https://civey.com/ \"BILD\", which is not even considered a newspaper, but is part of the rainbow press due to their mass of large scale pictures, headlines and advertisements, used to be a good indicator for the general sentiment of the working class for decades, but I think their influence and feedback into the political process abates, since they're losing their traditional readers and thus their scope. Second, I think this odd-seeming, almost schizophrenic behavior is typical for the election process of a German chancellor. If you take e.g. Gerhardt Schr\u00f6der, who has been chancellor twice, was a rather low light, but ambitious enough to apply for candidacy for chancellor of his party SPD. He used to have a good support in his state of Lower Saxony, but only shortly ahead of the general election, he became powerful enough within his party, after (with support of the industry in his state; there is a lot of steel works and car manufacturing, e.g. Volkswagen in Wolfsburg) he took out a large one-page ad in each and every newspaper in Lower Saxony with the slogan \"\"Der n\u00e4chste Bundeskanzler muss ein Niedersachse sein!\" (The next chancellor must be a Lower Saxonian!) The slogan caught attention, since inhabitants there were implicitly promised to be granted advantages if \"one of them\" is ruling. As a result, he was winning big on his state level, became the SPD's candidate, and finally won the general elections by a slight margin.\nI think that's what S\u00f6der is aiming at, too: all his signals and rhetoric are pointing to making the Bavarians believe he was only interested and focused on promoting Bavaria to create the impression of a strong support of his grateful home population on the state level, which then renders possible his candidacy for chancellor in the first place. By voting for CSU on the state or municiple level to make S\u00f6der stay in place, Bavarian voters will actually vote him to Berlin. Don't worry, that's the normal craze of German politics. Timing seems to be everything in this game: you will have to appear to be pushed by your believers into more ambitious positions, otherwise you will appear poor and desperate.\nIf you announce your will for candidacy too early, media will find some dirt to throw at you, and you will be burnt early. Even whitin a politician's individual careers, there's a \"right-place-right-time\"-aspect to it. Schr\u00f6der served under the party leadership of Rudolf Scharping, who had a general perception of being slow, \"sleepy\", and unambitious. In the light of this, Schr\u00f6der had to appear to be the better alternative by fate, after Scharping lost a general election. In other surroundings, Schr\u00f6der would have been just one of the many.\nSome talented politicians or technocrats have not understood these mechanics of popularity, and were ambitious at the wrong time, and failed or remained one of the many just the same. Who will ever remember Thorsten Sch\u00e4fer-G\u00fcmbel?

By the way, Friedrich Merz just recently uttered misgivings and is not sure yet, whether he will support a proposal for a quota for women in top party positions, which will be elaborated in further detail before it will be voted on on the December Parteitag.

Roettgen in February  was \"not widely seen as a big hitter in the party and few political analysts rate his chances\" [4]. Campaigning is likely not to begin until the fall, due to COVID [3].

I really do hope that we won't elevate Laschet or Merz. The former showing his lack of competence on a near-daily basis with more or less idiotic suggestions how we could restart the largest congregations of people (Bundesligaspiele), while completely ignoring the normal economic problems, where his focus as a state leader should lie. Especially with him being part of the (at least self-proclaimed) \"economically more literate\" party. And Merz shows time and again that he is neither willing nor able to contribute anything unless he is the undisputed leader and he has a large black mark against him with his BlackRock history. I'm always vary about outsiders as they allow far too much projection space for the abstract hopes of the people (see also the crash and burn of Martin Schulz 2 years ago) and then if elected lack the appropriate contacts and networks to actually affect stuff.\nThere is some argument to be made for Norbert Roettgen, I'm somewhat sceptical, due to his history of conflicts with Merkel, I do think there is a significant risk of Jens Spahn becoming the new party chief though.  Therefore I'm going to hedge a bit: It is unlikely for the party leadership to stay as is, in particular as AKK already said she won't be leading the party, there may be delays to that, but due to the next election being next year, I do think the CDU would be well advised to decide their leadership this year (5%). Both Laschet and Merz have significant backing and won't go quietly. I do think especially by the good performance of the current government (it turns out it's actually helpful for the chancellor to have some science background), both Merz (as the primarily Merkel-is-wrong-candidate) and Laschet (due to his both ineffective and contra productive attempts to trigger some \"reopen earlier\" campaign) lost appeal, I'm still giving them 15% each due to Laschet being the leader of the largest state organisation of the CDU and Merz due to his (in my eyes inappropriate) outsider appeal. These options cover a third of the probability: Roettgen is a complete wildcard (too little visibility in the greater public) but he has not actively degraded the argument for him in the past month or so. I'm giving him 20%. The rest  (45%) therefore goes to someone else.
