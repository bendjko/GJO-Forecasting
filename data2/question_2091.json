The situation has not changed much since my summary of her previous report of October 19 [3], apart from an announcement by the relevant German ministry which I have also reported here [4] . Here are the key points of the paper: ---------------\nOn 25 October, having received and studied all the replies, the [German Federal] Ministry [or Economic Affairs and Energy] announced that \nNS2 certification would not endanger the security of gas supply to Germany and the EU. [...] it is conceivable that BNetzA could indicate to the NS2 operator that it could \nstart flowing gas *before* its certification process is completed and continue to do so on a time-limited \nbasis to alleviate a supply shortage in Europe. [...] Alternatively, certification could be \u2018fast-tracked\u2019 with either or both BNetzA and the EC taking less time \nfor assessment than the maximum period allowed by the acquis, followed by a swift start of gas flows. \nThis scenario, while possible, could make BNetzA and the EC vulnerable to criticism of the certification \nprocess being insufficiently thorough, particularly from those countries that have been highly critical of \nNS2 and its certification, most vocally Poland. However,  some of this criticism about timing could be \ndeflected by the fact that NS2 AG had first submitted its certification request to BNetzA on 11 June, \nwhich suggests that BNetzA may have started reviewing the documents submitted as part of the request \nbefore the last required document was received on 8 September, when the official start of the 4-month \ncertification procedure was triggered. This suggests that BNetzA may need less time than the 4 months \nallowed by the acquis and issue its draft certification decision ahead of its early January deadline.   Under either of these two scenarios, NS2 could start flowing gas in winter 2021-22, and potentially even \nbefore the end of 2021. Another scenario, under which no gas would flow via NS2 until summer 2022 \nwhen the certification procedure is completed at the end of the 10-month period, is also possible.  [...] it is possible that Germany may attempt to condition NS2 certification on continued transit \nacross Ukraine after 2024, when the existing transit agreement expires. Should this attempt fail, it could \nseriously complicate, if not derail, certification. CONCLUSION When will the flows start? As the obstacles in respect of technical certification \nof NS2 appear to have been overcome, NS2 could start flowing gas to Europe in winter 2021-22, and \npotentially  even  before the end  of 2021, under two scenarios (the first of  which appears  to  be more \nrealistic than the second): \n\uf0b7 on an *ad hoc* and time-limited basis (which could subsequently become permanent) to alleviate \nthe European gas supply crunch, if cleared by BNetzA, while NS2 AG regulatory certification is \npending, or  \n\uf0b7 on a permanent basis with NS2 AG regulatory certification being \u2018fast-tracked\u2019 by BNetzA, the \nGerman government and the EC. The  question  of  guaranteeing  continued  post-2024  Ukraine  transit  is  likely  to  become  an  important \nfactor, influencing  whether  either  of these two scenarios  will materialize. Failure  to agree on it could \nsignificantly complicate, if not derail certification.

If the Germans have until January to complete their process then I\u2019m not sure what the reasoning would be for rushing to an earlier conclusion.  Yes the gas prices are high in Europe, but they will want to complete the process correctly I guess, especially given all the controversy. According to the nord stream 2 site, they started filling the first section for commissioning in 4 Oct and completed 18 Oct if we read the press releases https://www.nord-stream2.com/media-info/news-events/the-first-nord-stream-2-string-filled-with-technical-gas-154/.  Second section still in pre commissioning.  So if we take 2 weeks for getting 2nd section up we are into early Nov.

If the sticking point is unbundling the network and seller points then they will need to approve that.  But this question only required supply to pass through the pipe and technically that can happen without the regulatory approval.  It also looks like the fine for this is relatively low in the bigger picture or value. However if supply is delivered where will it go if it can\u2019t be sold in Germany without the regulatory approval.  This is where things get even less clear for me.  So I\u2019m sticking to simple principles around the question, I assume there is some gas storage at the german end of the pipe so if anything is pumped into that storage this question is resolved regardless of anything else. This decision will be a political one I guess for Gazprom, even though the operator is based in Switzerland.

Nord Stream 2: when will the gas flows start? [...] 2.2.1 Technical certification [...] While it is not  entirely  clear  which  entities  have  ultimately  carried out pre-commissioning and certification  services, \nthe NS2 AG statement confirming the pipeline has been \u2018independently certified\u2019 and the DEA statement \nconfirming  fulfillment  of  all  \u2018conditions  concerning  certification\u2019  suggest  the  technical  certification \nchallenge has been successfully resolved.   [...] 2.3 Conclusion \nThis author\u2019s answer to the question posed in the title of this section is as follows. As the obstacles in \nrespect of technical certification of NS2 appear to have been overcome, the pipelines could start flowing \ngas  to  Europe  in  2021  under  two  scenarios  (the  first  of  which  appears  to  be  more  realistic  than  the \nsecond):  - on  an  ad  hoc  and  time-limited  basis  to  alleviate  the  European  gas  supply  crunch,  if  cleared  by \nBNetzA, while NS2 AG regulatory certification is pending, or  \n- on a permanent basis with NS2 AG regulatory certification being \u2018fast-tracked\u2019 by BNetzA, the \nGerman government and the EC.   The  question  of  guaranteeing  continued  post-2024  Ukraine  transit  is  likely  to  become  a  factor, \ninfluencing whether either of these two scenarios will materialize.   Another scenario, under which technical certification is not resolved in 2021 and/or BNetzA, the German \ngovernment and the EC conduct regulatory certification using the full length of time while indicating that \nany pre-certification flows would be penalized, would see no flows via NS2 at least until summer 2022. \nUnder this scenario Russia\u2019s pipeline gas exports to Europe (excluding Turkey) would be limited by the \namount of firm capacity booked (or available for booking) on the existing export routes for as long as \nNS2 capacity remains unavailable \u2013 that is ~170-175 bcma (including up to 45.5 bcm via Ukraine28) \u2013 \nthus significantly limiting its contribution towards alleviating any European gas supply crunch in winter \n2021/22 and European gas supply in the mid- to long-term. \n------------------ So, tough nut indeed; I highly suggest going through the whole section 2 (pp 10-14). Yafimava seems to be dismissive of the scenario where the pipeline starts operating without (even a temporary) approval by the German authorities [2]: > In all seriousness, why would Gazprom do it? It is true that everyone seemed to have been taken by surprize when, on Oct 4, all involved parties (NS2, the Danish Energy Agency, and BNetzA) announced that the pipeline had been technically certified [3, 4, 5]; just 20 days before, analysts were (justifiably, IMO) still considering the technical certification the most tricky and uncertain piece of the puzzle (see for example [6]), and no information whatsoever for any ongoing works had been reported. And a couple of days later came another wholly unexpected fact, too (about which, surprisingly, Yafimava says nothing in her most recent summary/analysis): the Advocate General of the EU Court of Justice issued an opinion that the NS2 *can* challenge the relevant EU directives against them, claiming that the previous reasoning of the court had been incorrect [7, 8]. Although this is a non-binding opinion and the final decision will take months, I think it may be relevant here, as it can add some arguments favoring a temporal/ad-hoc clearance of the pipeline for operation before the final regulatory certification. Thing is, I have not heard anyone (except the Russians) claiming that a start of NS2 operations before 2022 is really expected to ease the nasty gas situation in Europe... As said,tough nut. --------------\n[1] https://www.oxfordenergy.org/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Gas-Quarterly-Review-Issue-15.pdf\n[2] https://twitter.com/katyafimava/status/1450146536848072707\n[3] https://www.nord-stream2.com/media-info/news-events/gas-filling-of-the-first-nord-stream-2-string-started-153/\n[4] https://en-press.ens.dk/pressreleases/nord-stream-2-pipeline-b-can-be-put-into-operation-3133391\n[5] https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/exclusive-germany-seeks-regulatory-assurances-nord-stream-2-cant-rule-out-2021-10-04/\n[6] https://jamestown.org/program/nord-stream-two-construction-completed-but-gas-flows-unlikely-in-2021/\n[7] https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2021-10/cp210179en.pdf\n[8] https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/eu-court-adviser-says-nord-stream-2-can-challenge-eu-rules-2021-10-06/"], [1333, "2021-10-19T06:37:29Z", [0.5], ""], [100653, "2021-10-18T07:05:30Z", [0.32], ""], [96828, "2021-10-17T12:17:51Z", [0.25], ""], [691, "2021-10-16T21:38:16Z", [0.08], "https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/germanys-nord-stream-2-gatekeeper-long-road-until-gas-flows-2021-10-15/ This suggests that if Gazprom chooses to obey the regulatory rules, no gas is going out until January or later.  However, as the story points out, they could just disregard the rules--well, they're more like guidelines--and shove the gas along tomorrow or the next day.   This would not likely make them any new friends, but the persistent and perhaps increasingly severe fuel shortages mean that Gazprom has the continent by the short and curlies and may not need friends at the moment.

It should be clear by now (and not only due to hindsight) that the (not only) Russian claims that the pipeline could be ready for commercial operation by Oct 1 [1] were simply ridiculous... To start with, Polish state-owned companies PGNiG SA and PST were granted acceptance to the *German* certification process by BNetzA on Sep 22 [2]. Notice that the German regulator was by no means *obliged* to accept the Poles into the process; neither was the Poles acceptance by any means certain. Here is Katja Yafimava from Aug 6 [3]: --------------\n\u201cBNetzA is not obliged to grant the PGNiG\u2019s request of joining the certification process, and indeed may be wary of granting it given that PGNiG has made it clear that it is against certification full stop,\u201d she said, adding that the German regulator is capable of assessing the impact of energy solidarity principle on its Nord Stream 2 certification decision without necessarily granting the PGNiG\u2019s request to participate. \n-------------- But PGNiG was granted acceptance indeed; quoting from their announcement [2]: --------------\nThe German Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur, BNetzA) has granted Polskie G\u00f3rnictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo SA and its German subsidiary - PGNiG Supply & Trading GmbH participation in the certification proceedings for Nord Stream 2. PGNiG SA and PST GmbH are of the opinion that Nord Stream 2 AG does not meet the formal and substantive requirements for certification in the preferential model of Independent Transmission Operator (ITO). Moreover, both companies argue that a positive decision of the BNetzA would put at risk the security of supply of the EU and Member States. \"We will prove consistently that Nord Stream 2 AG does not meet the formal and substantive requirements for the operator of the pipeline, in particular those relating to security of supply and the corporate structure of the company,\u201d Both companies emphasize that putting the pipeline into operation before obtaining a final certification decision will constitute a breach of German and EU law. Operating without final certification decision would lead to discrimination of other energy companies and distortion of the competition on the internal gas market. For this reason, PGNiG SA. and PST GmbH reserve their right to use all legal measures to oppose such conduct of Nord Stream 2 AG. The certification proceedings were initiated on September 8, 2021 [...] The European Commission participates in the proceedings and delivers its opinion to the BNetzA. While adopting its final decision, the German regulatory authority shall take the utmost account of the Commission\u2019s opinion.\n--------------- And what does the European Commission say? In a written answer of Sep 15 [4] on a parliamentary question filed by Polish MEP Anna Fotyga [5], it is noticed: > The Commission has voiced on several occasions that the Nord Stream 2 project is not needed from the perspective of security of supply and does not support the objective of diversifying the energy sources of the EU. Notice that the Poles in their announcement excerpted above seem to take particular aim at the opinion repeatedly expressed by Yafimava that BNetzA could grant a draft/provisional certification subject to conditions to be fulfilled in the future, allowing gas flows to start in the meanwhile [6, 7, 8]. It is true that other analysts (e.g. Chris Weafer in [3]) have argued that, even if the Poles get invited, it does not mean that they will really be able to influence the process; but I take their acceptance to signify BNetzA's intention to play this thoroughly and by the book, and not to take any shortcuts. So, what was the situation before these updates? As of Sep 14, the Jamestown Foundation estimates that gas flows are unlikely to start in 2021; here is their rationale [9]: -----------------\nFirst, each of Nord Stream Two\u2019s twin strings has to be inspected with relation to possible leaks before the pipeline can be finally certified [...] and commissioned. [...] Heretofore, there was no official information coming from the Russian side on how the pre-commissioning is actually progressing, but it can be assumed that the process has continued to move forward. It can be deduced that the Russians probably managed to fill the gap after Baker Hughes [...] left the project due to the risk posed by United States sanctions; however, it is still unknown what impact it could have in terms of possible delays. Second, when the pipeline strings are pre-commissioned, Nord Stream 2 AG will have to ultimately secure technical certification \u2014 believed to be the trickiest task in the light of the current US sanctions regime. [...] The proper Nord Stream Two certifier [DNV] withdrew from the project in January 2021; and since then, the Russians have not revealed how they actually plan to fulfill the requirements in that regard. The certification has to be performed by a well-recognized, independent third-party company, so that it will be accepted by the relevant authorities (including inter alia the Danish Energy Agency). Thus, it should not be executed by, for instance, one of the murky Russian \u201cspecial purpose\u201d companies or any freelance specialists hired by Gazprom. Third, apart from the solely technical issues, Nord Stream 2 AG still has to be granted gas transmission operator status. The relevant procedure is being conducted in Germany by the regulatory authority Bundesnetzagentur (BNetzA), and it is expected to last quite a long time. On September 13, BNetzA officially started reviewing the Nord Stream 2 AG documentation, and it has four months to prepare a draft decision. After this, the draft decision will have to be reviewed by the European Commission, which can take an additional two\u2013four months; only then can BnetzA finally certify Nord Stream 2 AG, if it meets inter alia the European Union\u2019s unbundling criteria, in line with the amended EU Gas Directive. Moreover, it cannot be ruled out that the process could become more complicated due to possible legal appeals filed or if the Polish gas company PGNiG is accepted to join the certification proceedings.\n-------------------- ... and regarding the last para - guess what? The Poles have just been accepted into the process, and they have also left the option of legal appeals explicitly on the table... As of Sep 13, Argus also estimates that NS2 certification is unlikely untill 2022 [10]; they, too, seem to shoot down Yafimava's opinion on a possible draft/provisional certification, even quoting BNetzA on the subject: -----------------\nOperating a gas pipeline without certification is not compliant with German energy rules, Bnetza said, which would keep the line from starting up until a positive decision is finalised. The regulator will only certify the operator if it can prove it is \"organised in accordance with respective unbundling requirements\", Bnetza said.\n----------------- One may also want to take into account the opinion of Oliver Hermes, chairman of the German eastern business association, who does not expect a fast certification of NS2 [11]. --------------\n[1] https://tass.com/economy/1327827\n[2] https://en.pgnig.pl/news/-/news-list/id/pgnig-sa-and-pst-were-granted-participation-in-the-nord-stream-2-certification-proceedings/newsGroupId/1910852\n[3] https://www.neweurope.eu/article/polands-continues-quest-to-delay-the-start-of-nord-stream-2/\n[4] https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/P-9-2021-003883-ASW_EN.html\n[5] https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/P-9-2021-003883_EN.html\n[6] https://www.politico.eu/article/3-hurdles-still-facing-the-nord-stream-2-pipeline/\n[7] https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/natural-gas/090321-gazprom-can-deliver-first-gas-via-nord-stream-2-before-year-end-miller\n[8] https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1335268\n[9] https://jamestown.org/program/nord-stream-two-construction-completed-but-gas-flows-unlikely-in-2021/\n[10] https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news/2253497-ns2-operator-certification-unlikely-until-2022\n[11] https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1336242"], [95683, "2021-09-28T02:24:38Z", [1.0], ""], [62808, "2021-09-27T20:46:25Z", [0.75], ""], [34959, "2021-09-27T14:54:42Z", [0.62], ""], [1333, "2021-09-27T14:09:13Z", [0.1], "The whole gas price/Nord Stream 2 story has blown up to huge proportions, but from where I sit no one understands what is actually going on as this whole story has become massively politicised.   I spent the last week researching this and have done a deep dive into the whole business. First point is that Russian gas exports to Europe are in terminal decline. On the one hand the mega-fields that supply Europe via Ukraine have passed peak and investment into them has tripled in the last few years just to keep production flat. On the other hand German Chancellor Angela Merkel said out loud that EU imports of Russian gas will fall to zero in next 25 years thanks to the Green Deal efforts.   What is actually happening is Russia has plenty of new gas (enough for 100 years) but it is unwilling to invest into production unless it can get the EU to commit to long-term contracts to ensure there will be a business in the coming years. Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov made the point over the weekend: Russia is happy to supply the EU with more gas if it signs contracts with Gazprom. Putin said the same thing at his meeting with Merkel: Russia is happy to send gas via Ukraine if the EU sign contracts that ensure sufficient off take. Russia is not willing to simply boost deliveries on an ad hoc basis and is currently sticking to the letter of its transit deal with Ukraine \u2013 and even that means Russia is actually producing and exporting record amounts of gas.   Bottom line is Russia is trying to squeeze what profit it can from the dying European gas business, but sees its future in LNG and piped gas to Asia where the volumes will decuple (look it up) over the next three decades.

Then began a gradual doubling of prices to $12 in June 2021. Spot prices in the European market have tracked the Japan/South Korea market this year because they need to refill storage supplies. The runup in US exports later in 2020 was due to recovery from the pandemic, as well as unplanned outages from competitors such as Australia. The US is now producing at near total capacity of 11 Bcfd. There is big money to be made by exporting LNG as the price differential between LNG within the US and overseas is large.

The $11 billion project doubling the capacity of the first Nord Stream pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres a year has been a focal point of tensions between Moscow and the West. Despite U.S. sanctions, Nord Stream 2 is almost complete and the key question is how Russia will ship its gas to Europe once a current transit deal between Kyiv and Moscow expires in 2024. After meeting German Chancellor Angela Merkel in the Kremlin on Friday, Putin said Russia planned to fully comply with its obligations on gas transit via Ukraine. He said Moscow was ready to send gas via its neighbour even after 2024 but Russia needed to understand the scale of demand for its fossil fuel first. \"And for this, we need to get an answer from our European partners on how much they are ready to buy,\" Putin told a news conference. \"We cannot sign a transit contract if we don't have supply contracts with our consumers in Europe.\" The European gas market is eagerly awaiting Russian flows via Nord Stream 2 as European gas prices have reached record highs due to low liquefied natural gas supplies. Putin said future gas supplies were a matter for talks given Europe's green energy drive. Ukraine has opposed the construction of Nord Stream 2, saying it was politically motivated.

Nevertheless, it would seem that the legal and regulatory procedures required before commencing commercial operation are no easy or straightforward task. Quoting from \"Nord Stream 2 and the Energy Security Dilemma\", by the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (July 27, 2021) [1]: \"technically speaking, gas could flow through the pipeline as early as the end of this year. The last open questions concern the application of the amended EU gas directive, the approval of an operating regime and technical certification. In the eyes of many observers, the final decision-making phase in the conflict over Nord Stream 2 has now begun.\" \"On 11 June 2021, Nord Stream 2 AG [...] applied to the German Regulatory Authority (BNetzA) for a certi\u00adfication as an independent transmission system operator [2]. This was done under German Energy Act \u00a74b. The German Fed\u00aderal Ministry for Economics and Energy must submit its assessment as to whether granting the certification would jeopardise the energy security of Germany or the EU within a period of three months. According to Energy Industry Act \u00a74a, the BNetzA has four months, until 11 October 2021, to draft a decision and to send it to the Euro\u00adpean Commission (EC) for an opinion. The EC, in turn, has two months to draft an opinion with recommendations. The BNetzA then has another two months to publish its decision and all related opinions and docu\u00adments. Given these timeframes for the regu\u00adlatory process, it could take until February 2022 for a first decision. Prior to this, the Energy Supervisory Authority of the Federal State of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania needs to approve commissioning. Moreover, the technical certification of the constructed pipelines still needs to be completed. Originally, the Norwegian firm DNV GL was responsible for this certification, but with\u00addrew when facing the risk of US sanctions in January 2021 [3]. It is unclear which compa\u00adny will complete the certification according to international standards as well as those of the German Association for Gas and Water (DVGW).\" As of July 12, the issue of the technical certification seems to be still open [4]: \"There have been questions over which entity would certify Nord Stream 2 as complete after Norway-based quality assurance company DNV GL in January said it would no longer provide pipeline integrity verification services for the pipeline due to the threat of US sanctions.\" So, according to the authors of [1], \"Given these timeframes for the regu\u00adlatory process, it could take until February 2022 for a first decision\"; but they also note that \"Tight market condi\u00adtions may come into play favouring Nord Stream 2\u2019s speedy technical certification and (preliminary) operation.\"  But what is the meaning of the cryptic excerpt \"whether granting the certification would jeopardise the energy security of Germany or the EU\" quoted above? Turns out it is about a recent (July 15, 2021) landmark decision of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), which seems to be suspiciously absent from the estimations of industry analysts that \"expect Nord Stream 2 to start supplies in October and to boost volumes through the winter season\" [5]. Quoting from \"What Next for Nord Stream Two? The Legal Battle in Europe Begins\" [6] by the (US) Jamestown Foundation (Aug 11, 2021): \"In a landmark development for European energy security, on July 15, Germany lost its appeal of the General Court judgement of September 2019, which overturned the European Commission\u2019s 2016 decision allowing Gazprom unrestricted use of OPAL. The case was brought by Poland and supported by Lithuania and Latvia. The General Court ruled in 2019 that the EU acted in breach of the principle of energy solidarity enshrined in the Treaty of the European Union; and the failed appeal confirmed that judgement\". \"The court essentially upheld the notion of energy solidarity among European Union members as a binding legal principle, which will change the way all EU institutions make decisions on strategic energy infrastructure going forward.\" \"the European Court of Justice went even further in its ruling on the appeal. In his opinion published earlier this year, influential judge Campos S\u00e1nchez-Bordona determined that the principle of energy security solidarity is binding on all institutions and bodies of the European Union. Thus, this principle should serve as a cornerstone in every future decision of the European Commission.\" \"In the concrete case of Nord Stream Two, the Commission must now consider the energy security of other EU members when approving the certification of pipelines owned or operated by third-countries as well as in decisions to exempt them from the provisions of the EU Gas Directive. [...] This means that Central and Eastern European countries\u2019 objections to Nord Stream Two \u2014because the pipeline would divert to Germany most Russian gas supplies vital to them\u2014 could no longer be ignored and overruled by bigger and more politically influential EU members, such as Germany.\" \"The ECJ judgement will also affect the outcome of Gazprom\u2019s request to have Nord Stream Two exempt from the EU Gas Directive. [...] But obtaining an exemption from Article 36 for Nord Stream Two [...] just became nearly impossible when viewed through the prism of energy solidarity. Not only do the pipeline operators have to prove that it will not be detrimental to market competition and internal market development as well as to the security of natural gas supplies, but they also have to convince EU members such as Poland and the Baltic States not to file objections.\" Such an invocation of the energy solidarity principle, when it was first made by the ECJ on September 2019, was met with much surprise \u2013if not disbelief\u2013 by the energy and law communities alike, as energy solidarity has previously been understood largely as a policy guidance rather than a legal principle [7, page 2]. But it is here, and it is now in turn invoked in itself, rather unsuprisingly, by Nord Stream 2 opponents - see for example the recent (Aug 11) priority question to the EC by Polish MEP Anna Fotyga [8]: \"The regulatory authority is obliged to refuse any certification that would put the energy supply security of any Member State at risk.\" \"Additionally, for companies controlled by non-EU entities, granting operator status requires an enhanced certification procedure, which includes a detailed analysis of the impact of certification on the security of EU energy supplies. This procedure is conducted by the competent authority of a given Member State in cooperation with the Commission. Since the Court of Justice issued a verdict in the OPAL pipeline case, no Member State can continue to ignore the energy solidarity principle and overlook the impact of its decisions on the security of the energy supplies of other EU Member States.\" Add to all this that, despite the recent agreement, the US is continuing to selectively impose sanctions to entities related to Nord Stream 2 [9], and arguably the situation is far from crystal clear and unambiguous... h/t to @ThR [10] (I would only very kindly suggest that, in accordance to the GJO spirit, they include the source when quoting). ------------\n[1] https://www.swp-berlin.org/en/publication/nord-stream-2-and-the-energy-security-dilemma\n[2] https://www.nord-stream2.com/media-info/news-events/application-for-precautionary-certification-as-independent-transmission-system-operator-submitted-150/\n[3] https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/natural-gas/010421-norway-based-dnv-gl-halts-nord-stream-2-certification-work-on-us-sanctions\n[4] https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/natural-gas/071221-nord-stream-2-gas-link-construction-to-be-completed-by-end-august-ceo\n[5] https://leaderpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/gazprom-says-controversial-russian-pipe-can-ship-gas-in-2021/wcm/f5dd69d3-9072-4ac1-8713-d2cd4dc10ad0/amp/\n[6] https://jamestown.org/program/what-next-for-nord-stream-two-the-legal-battle-in-europe-begins/\n[7] https://www.oxfordenergy.org/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Insight-87-The-OPAL-Exemption-Decision.pdf\n[8] https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/P-9-2021-003883_EN.html\n[9] https://www.state.gov/imposition-of-sanctions-in-connection-with-nord-stream-2/\n[10] https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1318779"], [1333, "2021-08-22T09:55:29Z", [0.98], ""], [96828, "2021-08-22T01:25:16Z", [0.57], "Sanctions. https://www.reuters.com/world/us-issues-nord-stream-2-related-sanctions-russians-blinken-2021-08-20/"], [96828, "2021-08-21T21:15:59Z", [0.58], ""], [691, "2021-08-21T20:07:52Z", [0.72], ""], [102157, "2021-08-21T16:35:54Z", [0.52], "Updated probability 47% -> 52% During his meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in the Kremlin on Friday, Vladimir Putin said that there are only 15 km left to finish the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.

In favor of the \"yes\" are factors like President Biden's decision to not apply sanctions and belief that the pipeline was too advanced to be stopped.  This tacit approval, along with Merkel's apparent desire to complete this deal, significantly increase the likelihood that the physical pipeline will be completed on schedule (by end of August).   However, Ukraine has pledged to lobby against it unless they can be given a guarantee of 10-15 years of stable gas flow.  Additionally, Germany and the US are likely negotiating terms to ensure that Russia is not able to use NS2 against its neighbors.  These things take time.  Furthermore, Germany's fiscal year technically ends on December 31st and plans were likely already in-place to ensure that the remaining LNG stocks would be sufficient once their \"heating season\" begins in October (President Biden only announced that \"Good friends don't have to agree\" last month).
