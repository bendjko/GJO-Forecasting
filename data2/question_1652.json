This is the case, despite an ongoing war of words between involved parties and China\u2019s aggressive continued expansion of its claimed territory. In its list of Conflicts to Watch in 2020, the Council on Foreign Relations listed \u201can armed confrontation over disputed maritime areas in the South China Sea between China and one or more Southeast Asian claimants (Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam)\u201d as top priorities with a high impact and a moderate likelihood of occurrence (\u201cConflicts to Watch\u201d). In January 2021, China passed a law allowing the China Coast Guard to fire on what it identifies as illegal foreign vessels in waters under its jurisdiction (Permal). The Philippines Foreign Affairs Secretary, Teodoro Locsin, Jr, suggested that the Philippine navy will shoot back \u2013 \u201cIf there is an incident, I can assure you there will be more than just a protest\u201d (Seidel, \u201cSouth China Sea\u201d). In a US Department of State briefing on February 19, 2021, Department Spokesperson Ned Price said, \u201cthe United States joins the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Japan, and other countries in expressing concern with China\u2019s recently enacted Coast Guard law, which may escalate ongoing territorial and maritime disputes.\u201d He continued, \u201cThe United States reminds China of its obligations under the United Nations Charter to \nrefrain from the threat or use of force, and to conform its maritime claims to the International Law of the Sea\u2026We stand firm in our respective alliance commitments to Japan and the Philippines\u201d (Price). Subsequent to China passing their new law, the US sent two Navy aircraft carrier strike groups to begin operations in the disputed waters of the South China Sea (\u201cTwo US Navy\u201d). A week later, Britain, France, Germany, Holland, and Canada all announced that they are sending warships to the South China Sea in \ngrowing \u201cpushback\u201d against Beijing (Seidel, \u201cBritish and Canadian\u201d). While the increasing rhetoric between the parties increases the likelihood of a lethal confrontation, there are indicators that peaceful options are still on the table. However, with tensions running high, and according to the CFR, in a \u201cworsening\u201d status (\u201cGlobal Conflict Tracker\u201d) all it takes is one small incident for a situation to turn deadly.  However, things get interesting when we look at the hard numbers. According to the Center for Strategic & International Studies\u2019 South China Sea Incident Tracker, incidents between China and others in the region have become less frequent, and in the past five years, incidents involving China have not resulted in deaths (China Power Team). \n2016 \u2013 13 incidents, no deaths\n2017 \u2013 3 incidents, no deaths\n2018 \u2013 3 incidents, no deaths\n2019 \u2013 5 incidents, no deaths\n2020 \u2013 1 incident, no deaths Since this question specifically relates to lethal confrontations in the next 28 days, I think there is nearly no chance of it taking place.

Any type of incident would stem from tensions regarding differing claims to the South China Sea.  Likely, such an event would happen between the People\u2019s Republic of China and the Philippines.  China holds the world\u2019s largest navy now, which gives them power and capability to protect their interests in the South China Sea against any other countries. \u201cChina's massive naval buildup coincides with it reinforcing its claims to almost all of the 3.3 million square-kilometer (1.3 million square-mile) South China Sea by building up tiny reefs and sandbars into man-made artificial islands heavily fortified with missiles, runways and weapons systems\u201d (Lendon 2021).  \u201cIn response to China\u2019s assertive presence in the disputed territory, Japan has sold military ships and equipment to the Philippines and Vietnam in order to improve their maritime security capacity and to deter Chinese aggression\u201d (Council on Foreign Relations 2021). \nThe chance for an attack is not impossible, especially considering China\u2019s newest coast guard law. \u201cThe National People\u2019s Congress standing committee in Beijing passed a law January 22 that expressly lets the coast guard use force. The law prescribes \u201call necessary means\u201d to stop foreign vessels, including use of weapons aboard Chinese ships\u201d (Jennings 2021).  \u201cVietnamese sailors died in 1974 and 1988 in military clashes with China. The two countries rammed each other\u2019s boats in 2014 when Beijing authorized placement of a Chinese oil rig in disputed waters. China and the Philippines entered a standoff in 2012 as the Chinese side took control of a shoal west of Luzon Island. China and Malaysia were locked in their own standoff in early 2020\u201d (Jennings 2021).  With tensions high, and disputes long-standing, something could spark a reaction from one country or another, but a lethal confrontation may not ensue.

China projects power through its artificial  islands that serve as staging bases for aircraft, warships, and maritime vessels. For a country like Malaysia who is conducting resource exploration in disputed waters, China's expansion represents a direct challenge to their territorial claims. Other tensions have manifested with Indonesia deploying fighter jets and naval ships to deter Chinese fishing in its waters and Chinese vessels sake a Vietnamese fishing boat in vicinity of the Paracel Islands. China's strategy is to slowly wear down the opposition to its territorial claims (Wescott & Lendon, 2020). Since the 1970s, Southeast Asian states have squabbled over the territorial claims to land masses and navigation rights in the South China Sea. China leverages its nine-dash line claims to argue its claims to sovereignty, yet other nations such as the US argue, that freedom of navigation is not trumped by claims to economic exchange zones (EEZs). Washington has interests in maintaining freedom of navigation in the area and provides backing to countries such as the Philippines and Taiwan (CFR, 2021). China uses the US commitment to rules of engagement of the law of war to its advantage. Instead of deterring US warships with the military, China hires fishermen and other non-governmental vessels to harass its neighbors in the region. This strategy effectively avoids the prospect of conflict, offers Beijing plausible deniability, and great political risk of a neighboring country's ship fires on one of the vessels as it would appear an attack on innocent civilians (Gady, 2015). \n\n\tChina values stability as a top priority. Making war with neighboring states would certainly destabilize the southeast Asian economies. Alternatively, China employs a long game of incremental aggression that rarely crosses the threshold of conflict that would warrant an escalation of force. The risk of lethal conflict as a result of defensive aggression from  Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and/or Vietnam is also unlikely. Although some leaders in Vietnam and Indonesia have attempted to confront Beijing on its incursions, these nations value stability as well and thus would prefer a diplomatic solution to armed conflict. China will not hesitate to retaliate against one of these nations if the US ceases to back them. If the US departs, then the chances for conflict increase as China will capitalize on the power vacuum left behind to secure its national interests in the Sea. \n\n\n\nCouncil of Foreign Relations.

Brunei's populace has been showing frustration with the Sultan due to the sluggish economy, corruption, and unemployment. With Brunei being a key node in the Belt and Road Initiative, they could be vulnerable in the future for occupation by China to gain more of a foothold in the SCS. However, I think it's highly unlikely that will happen before the end of the month. \nIndonesia- (3 pts) 2016- holding Chinese fisherman in a dispute with China over the fisherman claiming they were in \"Chinese traditional fishing grounds.\" China has discouraged Indonesia from joining countries that challenge China's territorial claims. 2020- Indonesians captured two Chinese vessels after one of them had a dead Indonesian Fisherman on it. \nMalaysia- (1 pt) Even though Malaysia's territorial claims overlap with China, they don't seem to be concerned with debating the issue. Placid relations with China could change with the election of Muhyiddin Yassin. \nThe Philippines (1 pt)- tensions between China and the Philippines due to Chinese ships surveying the Benham Rise. The Chinese claim that their intentions are purely for research. The UN recognizes Indonesia's claim to the resource-rich Benham Rise undersea plateau. \nSingapore (1 pt)- \"Mr. Lee laid out Singapore\u2019s interest in and stand on the issue, saying that while the country does not have any claims of its own in the South China Sea, and does not take sides on the specific claims of claimants, Singapore still has a lot at stake in three areas: International law, freedom of navigation and unity in ASEAN.\" The only reason I would justify giving Singapore a point would be in the event they discover oil in a potentially contested area.\nVietnam (11 pts) - If there's any country that will most likely have a conflict with China over the next month, it's Vietnam. The two countries have had multiple standoffs in the last ten years. Numerous instances of Chinese vessels ramming and sinking Vietnamese vessels have been reported. With the inclusion of cyberattacks on Vietnam from China, I would wager that the likelihood of an attack on Vietnam from China is higher than any of the other countries. I'm giving this a 10% chance for the simple fact of the previous issues between the two countries in the contested areas around the Paracel Islands. Also, an additional point just because it's another country on the list that could potentially conflict with China. \nWhen it comes to the South China Sea, China is focused on expanding their territory, and they know the real threat to their success is the United States. Since 2015 Xi Xinping has focused heavily on developing China's Navy. Now with the largest navy in the world, China is poised to defend the territory they think belongs to them. The sheer number of their vessels (360) sounds daunting, but the US Navy still has better manpower, more experience, and better training. Additionally, US ships are armed more heavily.  (2 pts) The only reason I could imagine China attacking one of the mentioned countries by the end of the month would be if one of them struck oil in their claimed territory. That would influence China to jump on the prospect of obtaining the resource for themselves. Since 1970 no country in South East Asia has struck a large enough oil reserve to fight for. It's unlikely to happen this month, but I'm still going to give it a few percentage points just on the possibility that it does happen.

The Spratly and Paracel Islands, specifically, are the source of increasing contention. China\u2019s island-building and land reclamation efforts based on claims of historical sovereignty encroach on the territorial islands and waters of these South Asian states. Indonesia and Singapore assert they are non-claimants in the South China Sea disputes. Confrontations stemming from these disputes have involved police/military forces of the respective country\u2019s sovereign waters and the fishing vessels of other claimants who entered the waters. The coast guards of various claimants have encountered each other and used intimidation tactics as well . However, there has not been a lethal confrontation between the respective militia/military forces/law enforcement of the claimants yet. There is a factor that may diminish the possibility of a future lethal confrontation. On November 15th, 2020, ASEAN member states and five regional partners \u2013 including China \u2013 signed the Regional Comprehensive Economic Plan (RCEP). According to Brookings\u2019 simulations, \u201cRCEP could add $209 billion annually to world incomes, and $500 billion to world trade by 2030.\u201d Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Vietnam signed RCEP. On one hand, because this agreement is so valuable, their membership could diminish the possibility of an intentional clash with China\u2019s military. The agreement promotes ASEAN centrality in the Indo-Pacific and strengthens these countries\u2019 relationships with China. On the other hand, this agreement may embolden China in its maritime strategy of off-shore balancing in the East and South China Seas. The strategy is committed to securing China\u2019s \u201cland and littoral frontiers\u201d (which includes the nine-dash line and Taiwan), consolidating influence in China\u2019s near seas (which include Vietnam and Thailand), and maintaining a balance of power which favors China. The agreement, therefore, could provide a certain level of peace, but also encourage China to increase its maritime activities.  It seems unlikely a lethal military/armed confrontation will occur among these countries before April 1st. Assuming this agreement eases tensions between the South Asian claimants and China \u2013 as well as decreases these activities in the South China Sea \u2013 I give this scenario a possibility score of 1%.

In September 2020, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi visited Myanmar, Indonesia, Brunei, and the Philippines in an effort to deepen mutual trust and promote cooperation, with Yi emphasizing that China-ASEAN relations is one of his top priorities. China and ASEAN countries have cooperated closely in a joint pandemic response, working together to develop and distribute vaccines, indicating non-hostile relations. However, over the past year, tensions have risen out of China\u2019s aggressive behavior in the South China Sea, with Malaysia, Vietnam, and the Philippines (along with a handful of Western countries) releasing statements calling on states to follow the rule of international law. In 2020, China increased tensions between itself and Vietnam, Malaysia, and the Philippines as the Chinese Coast Guard sank a Vietnamese fishing boat (no one was injured), a Chinese ship entered contested waters off Malaysia, and a Chinese warship aimed its weapons control radar at a Philippine naval vessel; however, no direct military conflict occurred. It is well-known that China, Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Brunei are locked in an overlapping series of maritime and territorial disputes, and though tensions between China and these countries wax and wane, it seems as if China is currently focused on strengthening diplomatic relations with ASEAN countries and keeping an eye on Western powers, especially the US, who send naval assets through the South China Sea region. Additionally, China has launched a month of military exercises and closed off around 80 square kilometers in Chinese waters for the month of March, so it is likely that military attention (at least the navy) will be diverting its attention to these exercises. There is a very low likelihood of a lethal military confrontation in the next month; however, with tensions being so high, it is possible that a ship or submarine in the wrong area or a trade dispute could escalate into a lethal military conflict, which is why I am giving a 5% likelihood of occurrence.

Since Germany is also planning to send a warship through the area, the Chinese government will likely sense increasing pressure from NATO powers and focus their attention on these issues rather than squabbles with the countries in question.  Any lethal engagements with neighboring nations in the South China Sea littoral region would likely only fuel further western pressure against China and not work to the advantage of the Chinese Communist Party, thus I suspect it is almost certain China will limit military action to their usual posturing against western naval vessels in the area.

Updated 20201120 China's recent 'Coast Guard Bill' is causing some anxiety in the SCS. See https://bit.ly/2UIvjSK, https://bit.ly/3kRWtB8 and https://bit.ly/35NrpOM. This enables the Coast Guard to use any and all necessary force within areas China claims as its own. That would include the SCS. This clearly has the potential to ramp up tensions an create a situation that can rapidly spiral out of control leading to a lethal confrontation.  Updated 20201028 At present, I will maintain my current forecast although the recent decision by Philippines to deploy militia (https://bit.ly/2Tv5ogX + https://bit.ly/3e5ui08 + https://www.cnn.ph/news/2020/10/21/PH-Navy-defends-plan-to-deploy-militia-to-West-Philippine-Sea-to-counter-China-s--.html) to the SCS area to counter Chinese aggression increases the likelihood of a lethal confrontation. However, Philippines will not be able to deploy this militia in the short term and it is debatable whether this will happen within the time frame of this question. Nonetheless, as mentioned previously, food supplies and security, in this case fishing, are exacerbating tensions in the region and increasing the potential for conflict  Updated 20201018 While Taiwan is not included in this forecast, China / PLA appear to be increasing tensions, incidents and events in the area of the SCS. See https://reut.rs/3ka9wON. All of this has the potential to lead to conflict and confrontation.  Updated 20201015 As noted previously, fishing and food shortages has the potential to exacerbate the situation in SCS regarding territorial claims. Philippines is now sending 'maritime militia' to the area to 'protect its fisherman'. See https://bit.ly/2H1DQNq . This has the potential for increasing tensions and the possibility of a clash which could escalate. My forecast is unchanged but close to being revised. Updated 20201011 Further indication of increasing potential for events that could lead to an escalation of tensions ending in a lethal confrontation in SCS - https://reut.rs/3dgpxAe Updated 20201008 Indonesia, states that it is not in dispute with China about any SCS claims, simply because Indonesia holds that PRC has no legal nor historical basis for any claims as per the nine dash line claims as any such historical claims  were superseded by UNCLOS, (United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea) which PRC ratified - see https://bit.ly/36O9tED. On this basis, Indonesia rejects any PRC proposal for bilateral talks on the topic. Indonesia has also confirmed that while it is cooperating with PRC on a covid vaccine, it will not be influenced by such cooperation to change the Indonesian position on the topic of the SCS. Equally, Indonesia has firmly stated it will enforce its EEZ and ensure PRC fishing vessels leave the area (https://bit.ly/34IoUMa) as happened earlier in 2020 (https://bit.ly/2GtAanv). Tensions are elevated in the area and PRC's increasingly aggressive activities in the area and around the Taiwan Straits risks a potential lethal confrontation, if only in the heat of the moment. Updated 20201004 An important aspect of this potential clash is the shortage of and increasing costs of fish from fishing for food supplies, i.e. food security, to the regional countries such as Philippines, Vietnam Indonesia etc. See https://bit.ly/2HVFErr. Note that China is the biggest subsidizer of its fishing fleets. All of this creates increasing potential for any form of potential 'lethal' clash in the SCS. 20200929 Update It appears that there is little likelihood of an agreement in the next 6 months between China and the above listed countries bordering and laying claim to the various parts of the SCS on a Code of Conduct for activities in the SCS. See https://bit.ly/3n4a1fq. Should such an agreement be reached, it would substantially reduce tensions in the area and hence the likelihood of any form of lethal conflict or confrontation.  20200924 Update The Philippines President, Duterte, makes it clear that his country stands by the Hague ruling on ownership of the parts of the SCS it claimed in ruling declared in 2016 using his UN 75th anniversary speech to stake his claim (https://bit.ly/33UCc7D). How China responds in the coming months may well determine the outcome of a lethal or non-lethal confrontation. Tensions in the area about the topic appear to be increasing.  20200922 Update Philippines is making its views known on the topic of the South China Seas (SCS) - https://bit.ly/3hRcs16 - which is another indicator that all the nations bordering the SCS, i.e. Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore & Vietnam, are pushing back against China's attitude and rejection of the international tribunal ruling. Thus, an increasing likelihood of some form of conflict which could preface a lethal confrontation.  20200919 Update I am still holding my current forecast on the basis I believe there is a chance of a lethal conflict. This seems borne out by this article: https://bit.ly/33LN6N5 Note that the article also refers to the Chinese fishing fleet part of the Chinese militia; \"And international analysts say China\u2019s fishing fleet is also not a civilian enterprise. It is a State-controlled militia co-ordinated by political commissars and trained to operate in concert with the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA)\". Whether any of the crew of the fishing vessels are militarily trained is debatable. However, one small error on the part of a fishing vessel could lead to a lethal conflict / confrontation. Note also the article refers to China's need to provide food for the country. Hungry people care more likely to enter into conflict. As this evolves, I will adapt my forecast. At a recent webinar, The South China Sea Dispute: US-China Rivalry, Lawfare and the Prospects for a Code of Conduct (https://bit.ly/3mJkJrF) by the The Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (ISEAS) in Singapore, one contributor, Dr Li Nan, a visiting senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore's East Asian Institute (EAI), suggested that China could drop its nine-dash line claims and enhance its soft power in the region (https://bit.ly/3mJkJrF & https://bit.ly/33HxFFz). An objective of the ISEAS webinar was \"it will further examine the prospects of ASEAN and China concluding negotiations for a Code of Conduct on the South China Sea by 2021\". While that is admirable, without China's participation, any such agreement is unlikely. Equally, should the participants agree a code of conduct, it must be first adopted by the participating countries and then ratified by those countries. Even if that should happen, China is likely to ignore it. This process will take longer than the time frame of this forecast and thus is likely to have iittle bearing on the forecast. 20200907 Update: See Par 5 of https://bit.ly/2R11ivN - A UN back international tribune ruled a) China has no legal claim to the are known as the South China Seas & b) the area is legally part of Philipines. Trump's current policy towards China is clearly to be firm and is often interpreted as aggressive (https://bit.ly/2R11ivN). Should Biden be elected President, he may well have to follow some of Trump's principles in the relationship with China albeit in a more diplomatic manner; See LA Times; https://lat.ms/3hfcrUt and Kyodo News Tokyo; https://bit.ly/3i8qWdI . In the event of Biden's election, he is likely to seek alliances both regionally and interntionally, in his policy towards persuading China to behave as a responsible super power. Thus, regardless of the result of the USA 2020 elections, USA allies in the region and more particularly Philippines may feel emboldened by the apparent support of the USA and this may in turn cause greater friction between the countries bordering the South China Seas and China leading to a lethal confrontation. On the basis of at least one death and using the broadest possible definition of 'militia, and or law enforcement'', it is possible that a confrontation of some sort, for example the ramming of a fishing vessel by a coast guard vessel or fisheries protection vessel, will take place in the South China seas in the disputed seas of the above listed surrounding territories and leading to one death within the period before 1 April 20201. As can be seen in https://bit.ly/2CVFkXo numerous incidents in the last few years have involved either ramming of vessels or shots being fired. China's claim to the seas in the area and the rejection of the international court of arbitrations ruling (See https://bit.ly/34y0NRy & https://bit.ly/3ji9wf3) appears to make some sort of confrontation inevitable. China's growing of vegetables on one of the supposedly inhabitable rocks (see https://bit.ly/2Ev10tY) appears to be an attempt to disprove or contrdict the 2016 international court ruling. This could further escalate tensions in the area. Updated 20200826: In the light of increasing tensions in the South China Seas (See https://reut.rs/34AKjIy) any accidental errors in the region could escalate into a major conflict. As noted in the quited article, a disputed USA election may provide the opportunity for China to take more aggressive action in the disputed area which in turn could lead to further conflict and loss of life, i.e. lethal confrontation."], [94889, "2020-09-22T15:15:49Z", [0.08], ""], [95789, "2020-09-22T14:41:54Z", [0.2], "When looking from the outside in I realize my initial thought that this type of confrontation is far less likely.

The world is anxious, and each nation outside of the SCS is distracted by its own domestic COVID and economic issues.  I believe the UN is in a place where many UN Partners are not interested in dealing with an aggressive China.  China is a large and influential trade partner.  Many Nations are facing economic issues at home in response to COVID and may be less likely to take action with China that could further hurt their economy.   If China shares this perspective, it may allow China to act even more aggressively in the SCS region.  On the other side of potential conflict, nations with interests in the SCS may be getting close to the end of their rope.  This feeling could push at least one of these nations into a situation where they believe a rational response to further encroachment/aggression from China is the application of lethal force, even if they don't already have broader support aligned ahead of time.  In addition, there is an election in the US that may impact China's actions.  A well-timed lethal event with China may impact the upcoming election or test the president following the election.

The reason for this being that military escalation on behalf of China would attract American attention, and likely even intervention, thus deterring China from pursuing an agenda of aggression. Moreover, historically, this is not an area that is prone to military conflict. In the last 45 years, there have only been 2 military conflicts in the area between China and Vietnam. \nOn June 15, however, China pursued a military conflict with India in regards to a border dispute, resulting in a few dozen deaths. This was done as a demonstration of strength on China\u2019s part after both its reputation and economy suffered as a result of COVID-19.

This would be something like the Vietnam war, or potentially even a war in another country in which both China and one of these states participate. \n- Border skirmishes.

I decrease my probability from 8% -> 5%. \n- The US factor increases this probability. The US has been increasingly concerned with China, and with elections coming up, Trump may attempt a last minute play at China. On July 13, the US State Department released a statement condemning Chinese actions in the region (https://www.state.gov/u-s-position-on-maritime-claims-in-the-south-china-sea/).

This seems borne out by this article: https://bit.ly/33LN6N5 Note that the article also refers to the Chinese fishing fleet part of the Chinese militia; \"And international analysts say China\u2019s fishing fleet is also not a civilian enterprise. It is a State-controlled militia co-ordinated by political commissars and trained to operate in concert with the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA)\". Whether any of the crew of the fishing vessels are militarily trained is debatable. However, one small error on the part of a fishing vessel could lead to a lethal conflict / confrontation. Note also the article refers to China's need to provide food for the country. Hungry people care more likely to enter into conflict. As this evolves, I will adapt my forecast. At a recent webinar, The South China Sea Dispute: US-China Rivalry, Lawfare and the Prospects for a Code of Conduct (https://bit.ly/3mJkJrF) by the The Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (ISEAS) in Singapore, one contributor, Dr Li Nan, a visiting senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore's East Asian Institute (EAI), suggested that China could drop its nine-dash line claims and enhance its soft power in the region (https://bit.ly/3mJkJrF & https://bit.ly/33HxFFz).  An objective of the ISEAS webinar was \"it will further examine the prospects of ASEAN and China concluding negotiations for a Code of Conduct on the South China Sea by 2021\". While that is admirable, without China's participation, any such agreement is unlikely. Equally, should the participants agree a code of conduct, it must be first adopted by the participating countries and then ratified by those countries. Even if that should happen, China is likely to ignore it. This process will take longer than the time frame of this forecast and thus is likely to have iittle bearing on the forecast.   20200907 Update: See Par 5 of https://bit.ly/2R11ivN - A UN back international tribune ruled a) China has no legal claim to the are known as the South China Seas & b) the area is legally part of Philipines.

Should Biden be elected President, he may well have to follow some of Trump's principles in the relationship with China albeit in a more diplomatic manner; See LA Times; https://lat.ms/3hfcrUt and Kyodo News Tokyo; https://bit.ly/3i8qWdI . In the event of Biden's election, he is likely to seek alliances both regionally and interntionally, in his policy towards persuading China to behave as a responsible super power. Thus, regardless of the result of the USA 2020 elections, USA allies in the region and more particularly Philippines may feel emboldened by the apparent support of the USA and this may in turn cause greater friction between the countries bordering the South China Seas and China leading to a lethal confrontation. On the basis of at least one death and using the broadest possible definition of 'militia, and or law enforcement'', it is possible that a confrontation of some sort, for example the ramming of a fishing vessel by a coast guard vessel or fisheries protection vessel, will take place in the South China seas in the disputed seas of the above listed surrounding territories and leading to one death within the period before 1 April 20201. As can be seen in https://bit.ly/2CVFkXo numerous incidents in the last few years have involved either ramming of vessels or shots being fired.  China's claim to the seas in the area and the rejection of the international court of arbitrations ruling (See https://bit.ly/34y0NRy & https://bit.ly/3ji9wf3) appears to make some sort of confrontation inevitable. China's growing of vegetables on one of the supposedly inhabitable rocks (see https://bit.ly/2Ev10tY) appears to be an attempt to disprove or contrdict the 2016 international court ruling. This could further escalate tensions in the area.

The South China Sea is an incredibly important region to global trade, as many shipping routes travel through the area. In 2017, 40% of the world's \"liquefied natural gas trade transited through the South China Sea\".  In recent years, China has made a large effort to establish full control over the area; both over its lucrative fishing rights and to establish control over the shipping lanes. Americans have conducted military operations in China's EEZ, contesting the Chinese's authority over the region, and making the US\u2019s presence in the region known. China is known to forcefully defend their territory and patrol their borders. President Xi sees the South China Sea as Chinese territory. The Council on Foreign Relations claims, \"exercising full sovereignty over this area is a core component of President Xi Jinping\u2019s 'China Dream.' China does not accept or respect the sovereignty claims of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, or Vietnam in this region.\"  China has not shied away from using lethal force to defend its borders. On the 15th of June, there was a lethal clash on the Chinese-Indian border. Exact casualty numbers are not available, but according to the NY Times, \"It was the bloodiest clash on that frontier since 1967\u201d, implying deaths in the double digits. The Chinese-Indian border is a land border, which is heavily militarized. A lethal confrontation over territorial rights in the South China Sea would certainly be a naval encounter. Historically, there have been very few lethal encounters in this region between military forces. There have been many instances of Chinese aggression resulting in deaths, but they have mostly been civilian deaths (fishermen).  The China India border is not one which concerns the global economy. The South China Sea is of far greater importance, and a military confrontation in the South China Sea would likely result in some form of American involvement, and could even lead to some sort of proxy war between the US and China. This is likely not a risk China is willing to take. In the past week, the US has denounced China's territorial claims in the region. The Americans have a large naval presence in the South China Sea. The Chinese are aware their actions in the South China Sea are under intense scrutiny. It would be incredibly unwise for the PRC to provoke the US by having a militaristic confrontation with one of the nations that claim a part of the South China Sea (Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Vietnam). The odds of a confrontation in the South China Sea are generally low on a monthly basis. But for a confrontation in the South China sea, between two military(!) forces and resulting in a death, the odds must be significantly lower.  Historically, there have been 2 major lethal military confrontations between China and the other South China Sea claimants (both times with Vietnam). These occurred in 1974 and 1988. There have been multiple conflicts over this timeframe involving civilian deaths(typically fisherman). A civilian base rate of 20% annually is roughly appropriate, with one death every five years. A militaristic base rate of ~4% annually seems appropriate, based on this historic data (2 encounters in 50 years).  As mentioned, tensions are currently high, which increases the chance of a lethal confrontation. \nHowever, because of the American presence in the region, repercussions of aggression will be intense, lessening the likelihood of a conflict. Because of these main two forces, I believe the probability of a lethal, militaristic conflict is about 45bp each month, or 1.5x the militaristic base rate. This implies a probability of 4% in the next nine months.

However, I've realized that this question is not focused on border disputes, but rather the south china sea dispute. I think it is highly unlikely to see a real lethal confrontation in the South China Sea because the US has gotten heavily involved in this region, and I do not believe that China would be willing to draw the ire of the US. On the other hand, we have seen escalation under the pandemic, and there is evidence of military drills being performed in the South China sea.

There was the lethal clash between Chinese and Indian soldiers, as well as the assertion of Chinese authority over Hong Kong in spite of international agreements and disapproval.  Further, tension has been growing in the area of the South China Sea recently, with China increasing its activities there, as well as the United States conducting military exercises.  I think that the demonstration of China's willingness to risk international sanction increases the likelihood fo a lethal conflict, as does increasing activity in the South China Sea.  However, I think that the strong US military presence in the area works against there being a lethal conflict, as China will be unwilling to risk a direct military conflict with a major trading partner and nuclear power.  Because of this, I think that the US military exercises meaningfully reduce the chance of a lethal conflict in the area.  All together, I believe that the chance of a lethal conflict is slightly higher than the base rate, though primarily because of the possibility of the US pulling out of the area.

Given the very small number of samples (and non-stationary distribution), unfortunately these may not be representative of the future. However, for now assuming that they are to some extent, this implies 0.05 expected incidents / year, and with high likelihood a <20% chance/year of an incident (modelled as binomial).

Civilian casualties are implicitly discounted. This is an important distinction, as it means that even significant violent events (such as Chinese CG vessels ramming/sinking fishing boats) wouldn\u2019t count. For a lethal confrontation to occur therefore, a number of events would have to occur to escalate the situation. Here is an example of a possible chain of events: -\tCompeting claims on economic/strategic/political rights to an area. ->\n->\tPresence of civilians from one/more competitors (i.e. fishing fleets/oil & gas representatives). ->\n->\tPresence of Coast Guard or Navy to guard nation\u2019s civilians/stop opponent\u2019s civilians (delete as appropriate). ->\n->\tConsequent presence of opponent\u2019s CG or Navy to guard nation\u2019s rights/stop opponent\u2019s interference (delete as appropriate). ->\n->\tEscalation of conflict to violence (either against civilians or directly against opponent) e.g. by ramming ships or warning shots. ->\n->\tReturn of violence by opponent. ->\n->\tFatality within military forces, militia, and/or law enforcement (the civilians don\u2019t count unfortunately). As you can see, this is quite a long chain of events, and as it specifies death of a combatant rather than civilian it actually excludes most fatalities that may semi/un-intentionally result from in-the-moment aggression. It would require both states to deliberately send in their armed forces, then one or both of those groups to actively target each other. As such, I have distinguished between the probability of violent clashes between countries and non-civilian fatalities. Assessment by country: 1.\tBrunei \nSometimes referred to as a \u201csilent claimant\u201d to the South China Sea, Brunei\u2019s EEZ covers a number of maritime features, but the kingdom claims only Louisa Reef which lies upon its continental shelf. Because Louisa Reef is part of the Spratly islands, that feature is also claimed by China and Vietnam.\nBrunei is the only claimant state that does not occupy any maritime features or maintain a military presence in the region. Predominantly for this reason, the likelihood of armed clashes between the two states\u2019 forces is vanishingly unlikely. Violent Clashes = 1-2%\nNon-Civilian Fatalities = 0% 2.\tIndonesia \nIndonesia has long maintained its neutrality and claimed to have no maritime disputes with China. Despite Indonesia\u2019s position as a non-claimant state in the SC Sea dispute however, more frequent clashes and a hardening approach from China has forced a shift in attitude in recent years.\n2016 \u2013 Three confrontations between Chinese fishing boats and the Indonesian Navy, including at least one where they fired warning shots; China\u2019s foreign ministry said one boat was damaged and one sailor shot & injured.\nJanuary 2020 \u2013 Stand-off between Chinese Coast Guard ships escorting fishing boats and five Indonesian warships and F16s off the coast of Indonesia. Indonesia is still cautious about escalating tensions however.\nDespite some conflict, the overall lack of direct opportunities for direct clashes (due to few/zero competing geographic claims) combined with Indonesia\u2019s unwillingness to escalate tensions with a growing trade partner suggests that this is unlikely to escalate to state-on-state conflict. Violent Clashes = 1-2%\nNon-Civilian Fatalities = <1% 3.\tMalaysia \nFormer Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said that China was not a threat to anyone in the South China Sea dispute and was not worried about aggression from China, accusing the United States of provoking China and trying to turn China's neighbours against China.\nThis line has hardened in recent years however, with Malaysia being involved in a stand-off with a Chinese survey ship and Chinese Coast Guard vessels. Events escalated in April, when a stand-off occurred between Malaysia, Vietnam, China and the US simultaneously, thus increasing the possibility of an armed clash.\nhttps://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/China-And-Malaysia-Clash-In-Highly-Disputed-South-China-Sea.html\nhttps://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3051889/malaysia-china-and-vietnam-dangerous-ongoing-game-chicken-south Violent Clashes = 15-20%\nNon-Civilian Fatalities = 1-2% 4.\tPhilippines \nApril 2012 \u2013 Scarborough Shoal standoff between Philippine Navy & PRC Coastguard\nMay 2013 - A Taiwanese fisherman was machine gunned to death by the coast guard of the Philippines. Although not PRC, it does indicate a willingness to use violence.\nJuly 2016 \u2013 UNCLOS panel unanimously ruled in favour of Philippines in dispute over china\u2019s claim on territories within the nine-dash line. China has rejected the ruling.\nJune 2019 - 22 Filipino fishermen were left floating after a Chinese vessel rammed and sank their boat, abandoning them to the sea.\nThe large number of incidents is mitigated by Duerte\u2019s recognition of strategic reality on the ground and consequently his unwillingness to escalate a conflict that would result in the Philippines\u2019 \u201cannihilation\u201d (https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1233091/south-china-sea-duterte-philippines-annihilation-beijing-grip-tightens-spt). Furthermore in December 2019 China and the Philippines finally agreed to cooperate in the South China Sea, pursuing joint oil & gas exploration, thus removing much of the impetus that might lead to conflict. Therefore, although the risk of a clash may have be high in the recent past, the risk a direct conflict between the two states\u2019 forces resulting in a fatality is quite low.  Violent Clashes = 10%\nNon-Civilian Fatalities = 1% 5.\tSingapore \nHistorically the two countries have quite close economic and political ties, in no small part due to Singapore\u2019s significant population of ethnic Han Chinese. \nIn 2016 China seized 9 armoured vehicles that Singapore had shipped through Hong Kong on their return from a training exercise on Taiwan. This marked the low point in C/S relations however, and Singapore did not retaliate. The two are strongly linked economically and are sufficiently far enough from each other that territorial disputes of the type felt with Vietnam and the Philippines are unlikely.\nhttps://www.fpri.org/article/2019/12/the-odd-couple-singapores-relations-with-china/ Violent Clashes = <1%\nNon-Civilian Fatalities = ~0% 6.\tVietnam \nVietnam has been the strongest proponent against China\u2019s territorial claims in the South China Sea in recent years. Hanoi\u2019s frustration is intensifying as Beijing becomes even more aggressive in the South China Sea. In January 2020 it released a defence White Paper suggesting a more formal hardening of that stance and even a shift into the US\u2019 sphere of influence to counter China\u2019s rising assertiveness.\n2014-2015 - Exchanges of fire across China/Vietnam land border.\nApril 2020 - Vietnamese fishing boat sank after it collided with a Chinese Coastguard ship near Vietnamese oil rig by the Paracel Islands. \nhttps://www.cfr.org/report/china-vietnam-military-clash  Violent Clashes = 25-30%\nNon-Civilian Fatalities = 3-5%"], [1333, "2020-06-24T18:07:53Z", [0.4], ""], [67609, "2020-06-24T17:54:00Z", [0.1], ""], [31275, "2020-06-24T15:24:34Z", [0.1], ""], [86658, "2020-06-24T11:20:56Z", [0.33], ""], [1333, "2020-06-23T18:21:41Z", [0.43], ""], [3429, "2020-06-23T17:19:58Z", [0.01], "maintaining current forecast for now."], [88416, "2020-06-23T15:53:22Z", [0.33], ""], [28899, "2020-06-23T07:14:13Z", [0.04], ""], [85984, "2020-06-23T06:36:03Z", [0.05], ""], [92379, "2020-06-23T00:10:37Z", [0.05], ""], [87427, "2020-06-22T21:57:55Z", [0.2], ""], [87064, "2020-06-22T15:37:26Z", [0.1], ""], [87064, "2020-06-22T15:20:59Z", [0.15], ""], [87064, "2020-06-22T15:02:05Z", [0.2], ""], [89013, "2020-06-22T14:21:06Z", [0.05], ""], [92379, "2020-06-21T23:19:48Z", [0.17], "I think a conflict with India is far more likely, taking focus away from Pacific neighbors"], [88953, "2020-06-21T10:34:16Z", [0.03], ""], [88953, "2020-06-21T08:08:09Z", [0.1], ""], [28899, "2020-06-21T08:00:25Z", [0.08], ""], [64078, "2020-06-20T18:07:14Z", [0.06], ""], [3429, "2020-06-19T16:19:59Z", [0.01], "Maintaining current forecast"], [31275, "2020-06-19T15:10:27Z", [0.16], ""], [92379, "2020-06-19T14:47:23Z", [0.2], "Something aggressive that turns lethal on accident is a possibility.

The Sino-Vietnamese war of \u201879 and the Battle of the Paracel islands took place before globalization took hold. China and Vietnam since then willfully accepted participation on the big stage to benefit and prosper economically. They wanted a slice of the proverbial pie.   Getting seconds means walking back on that stage in the spotlight, with economic sanctions waiting if the thin red line is crossed.  Russia\u2019s care or concern for economic sanctions is nonexistent, and the little green Spetsnaz soldiers proved Crimea was more critical to expanding power projection or crossing some singular economic juncture with its Black Sea natural gas fields, as opposed to a multifaceted global trade strategy. The SCS shares some characteristics with the Black Sea, in its near billion barrel expected gas reserves and highly lucrative fishing grounds.  The region is a gold mine surrounded by demand with no end in sight.   The Chinese have a fleet of maritime militia and Coast guard boats that harass Vietnamese and Phillipine vessels.  The Vietnamese also have armed maritime militia boats capable of peaceful fishing activities or conversion to vessels of defense as needed.   They are the Dan Quan Bien.  Fish boat rammings USUALLY occur when the Vietnamese or Phillipine vessels are caught fishing between May 16 and August.  The Chinese recognize the need for some level of conservation before all the biological resources are depleted.  Water cannons have been used in the past, along with boat rammings, neither of which led to military response. Malaysian state owned Petronas sent an exploratory vessel, the West Capella, just beyond its 200 mile economic exclusion zone.  For many days the vessel was \u201charassed\u201d.  Harassment and armed attack are two completely different types of threats, and escalation into a two or greater clash of naval vessels would certainly lead to greater US activity in the SCS.  And China is fully aware the size of the US submarine and potential drone submarine fleet. The only possibility of battle I see is if Malaysia were to find proven oil or gas reserves.  A Chinese CG vessel damages or destroys the construction of a drilling platform in process and employees are killed. Or a Malaysian Navy vessel is encroached upon during the installation of the drilling platform.   Doubtful in this time frame though. The fishing moratorium will be enforced until August this year.

Once the communist party of China feels more secure in their situation, such as after they recover some of their economy and feel that public opinion in China has settled to at most an enthusiastic continuance if the Mandate of Heaven upon the current regime or more likely a majority apathetic position as people calm down and fall back into their sense of no control and no power to change things for the better. After this calming of the masses, China will turn again with devious means to undermine not only the sovereignty of the states of South Asia but will most definitely seek to exact revenge on those who replaced them as suppliers of goods to the West.

[1] Based some quick wikipedia searching, for most of these countries, lethal confrontation between national military personnel and that of China is a once-in-several-decades occurrence, and/or unprecedented in the last several decades [2]. Total WAG on the base rate is that the range of probabilities for each individual country is somewhere between close to zero and P=0.05, with the mean being somewhere around P=0.01. With this WAG, therefore, the probability that at least one lethal confrontation takes place is P=1-(1-0.01)^6=0.058. I don't see any strong signals to deviate one way or another from that base rate.

While Singapore seems highly likely to end up just like Hong Kong for the aim of China dominating marine transportation and monopolize ports and trade in that region, a conflict is likely to happen not this year, and not next year, maybe not even in this decade.\nAs soon as China has got a lever for a political refurbishment in their dooryard, they will use it.
