We were fearing cost-push inflation due to supply chain problems and Americans delaying returning to work.   The primary factors driving the inflation narrative have improved.  The employment numbers are now better.  This includes the upward revisions to the past numbers.   Pfizer also has a new very effective covid pill. Oil prices are heading the other direction however.  Oil demand is increasing as the pandemic plateaus or declines.  Yet, supply is determined by OPEC+ politics.  The Saudis and Russians are working together to limit supply and raise prices to a reported $100 a barrel by Christmas.  This will have an impact. Also, the end date for this question is less than two months away.  The public tends to greatly over-react to strong positive and negative news stories.  Also, reflexivity is definitely at play per Soros.  There were a lot of negative stories on inflation.  Yet, the stories improved just this week with the employment and Pfizer news.  The news on oil prices has been and is still very negative.  I think the over-all news on employment will improve over the next two months, but oil news will get worse.    Therefore,  balancing the major influences -- the employment numbers,  the Pfizer pills, the pre-pandemic normal rate, the return to normal, oil prices and media reports--the net is a strong upward pressure to a pre-pandemic normal (3.0-3.5 percent).   The only question is how long it will take.

Historically this is a very low 30 year treasury yield, caused by persistently low-interest rates and a lack of inflation over the past few decades.\nhttps://www.macrotrends.net/2521/30-year-treasury-bond-rate-yield-chart\nhttps://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/TextView.aspx?data=yieldAll Why is it rising? Less people wanting to buy a 30 year bond = a lower price = higher yield. I think demand is decreasing because of recent inflationary expectations. More and more people are expecting the inflation rate to be higher than the current bond yield. This situation means they would be losing money (eg. 2.3% bond yield but 3% inflation = real loss of 0.7%), so they obviously don't want to buy any. Inflation is not caused by more money sitting around, it's caused by the spending of that money (velocity of money). More spending = increased velocity = more inflation (if other conditions stay the same). I think inflationary expectations & actual inflation will only get higher in the coming months. There is an unprecedented amount of private savings right now (More than $2 trillion! [1]). As the economy starts to open up, more of this money will be spent. The unemployment rate will gradually decrease, again causing more spending. And, there is likely going to be a HUGE stimulus package of more than $1.5 trillion, which will cause more spending. Furthermore, There may be another huge spending package, focusing on industry, again totalling more than $1 trillion.  And, on top of all that, the Fed just said they would not attempt to slow down inflation for some time. They are not going to raise the interest rates, and want inflation to exceed the 2% target to 'make up for lost ground' over the previous decade.\n\nCommodity and house prices are already rising very quickly.  However, a slow jobs recovery could prevent inflation from gaining momentum for a few years. Also, a rising yield becomes more attractive, meaning more people will want to buy it, meaning the yield will get pushed back down in the short term (more attractive to the ones with lower inflation expectations). Furthermore, a sudden change in Fed policy is unlikely but still possible.

Factors which may influence the rate (see linked article for source at end) according to my understanding (which may be flawed, some of these are hard to follow): 1.) Economic conditions: Not great, but I don't think things will deteriorate much. Government response has been much stronger than 2009 and has really played an important role in keeping things afloat. Once vaccines hit and the virus plays a smaller role I think there's a good chance for a faster recovery. This points toward steady or increasing yields in my view.\n2.) Demand for risk-free securities: Demand drives yields down, and in uncertain economic conditions like now (despite a strong stock market) I think that's playing a role in lowering yields. I'm unsure on this factor, the S&P 500 seems inflated relative to the economy and a correction could cause treasury yields to drop as people switch from stocks to bonds. But a correction may not happen.\n3.) Supply of T bills: Deficits are large, so the government needs to issue more T bills. This could have an effect on raising the yield, as to get more buyers of T bills the government has to offer more attractive rates.\n4.) Monetary policy: I don't understand this fully, but I believe the gist is the FED performs actions that will lower the interest rate to boost investing and economic activity. The FED has committed to low rates for the near future and is actively trying to boost the economy, so this will keep interest rates low. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS\n5.) Inflation: High inflation results in higher bond yields as I understand it. More inflation means bonds - which are typically lower yielding - are less desirable, and to attract buyers the bond rates have to go up. Inflation has declined over time, which has probably played a role in declining bond yields. And inflation drops during recessions, likely causing bond yields to drop with them. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FPCPITOTLZGUSA Some of these factors counteract the others, but overall I think the economy is likely to hold steady or recover at a decent pace thanks to effective government measures, and I think that will translate to steady or slightly increasing treasury yields. It's also interesting to note that the 2009 recession seemed to create a much briefer drop in yields than this one has. I don't know why that is, but it raises the possibility that the drop in yields could be very temporary this time too.

This means the \"market\" on net did not buy any US debt in 2020 but on net sold a little bit. another way of looking at this is that the US government cannot afford to pay a market rate of interest on the national debt which has grown way too large to handle. the US government has made it clear it has no intentions of balancing the budget or paying down US debt. all debt in 2020 was covered by simply printing money which is inflationary and inflation is already rising. The US dollar showed considerable weakness in December 2020.  I noticed that right now the 30-year Treasury amount of 1.67 is just barely above CPI inflation of 1.6. it is pretty unrealistic to be selling 30-year debt at an amount below the current rate of inflation. Since I expect inflation to rise over the next 12 months I expect 30-year US Treasury percentages to rise as well, however, since the market is almost completely artificial and the Federal reserve can push it down as low as they wish it is hard to know. Keep in mind that the Federal reserve has a target rate of inflation of 2% and has been talking that they would allow inflation to go higher than 2%, which I have taken as acknowledgment that the inflation is going to rise and they can do nothing about it. All the US government knows how to do is spend. They are going to continue to pass emergency stimulus bills which will be funded by simply issuing new debt covered by spending money. we have slowly reached a point where more and more of the newly issued US debt has to be covered by the fed, and I think we will see increasing amounts of treasuries being sold on the market as China and Japan and Russia try to unload their existing portfolios.
