Yesterday, Pelosi\u2019s counterpart in the Senate, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), held a press conference along with Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), urging President Biden to cancel $50,000 or more in student loan debt. \u201cPresident Biden should use his existing legal authority to cancel up to $50,000 in student debt,\u201d Schumer said in remarks, contradicting Pelosi\u2019s subsequent comments. Schumer donned a \u201ccancel student debt\u201d face mask during his press conference.\n> In her remarks today, Pelosi also questioned whether student loan cancellation was even prudent, arguing that taxpayers may not necessarily want their tax dollars utilized to cancel someone else\u2019s debt, suggesting that she may not even support mass student loan forgiveness in a Congressional bill, should Biden not act using his executive authority.  *** It could be confirmation bias on my part (after all, Shumer is arguing the opposite), but this halves my probability from 4 to 2%."], [49877, "2021-07-27T21:18:34Z", [0.0], ""], [55987, "2021-07-27T15:39:46Z", [0.0], ""], [88452, "2021-07-27T07:43:48Z", [0.0], ""], [95992, "2021-07-27T01:05:16Z", [0.0], ""], [59836, "2021-07-25T15:22:25Z", [0.0], ""], [28563, "2021-07-24T14:10:03Z", [0.0], ""], [99780, "2021-07-23T17:35:31Z", [0.02], ""], [52131, "2021-07-23T14:25:14Z", [0.35], ""], [94872, "2021-07-23T05:52:51Z", [0.01], ""], [87897, "2021-07-22T16:17:43Z", [0.01], ""], [97262, "2021-07-21T13:41:47Z", [0.01], ""], [34959, "2021-07-21T12:56:01Z", [0.01], ""], [691, "2021-07-20T17:11:50Z", [0.0], ""], [80475, "2021-07-19T20:00:21Z", [0.0], "Clock running out on this"], [61391, "2021-07-19T16:49:28Z", [0.0], ""], [60948, "2021-07-19T13:00:37Z", [0.04], "Biden Has Now Cancelled $40 Billion Of Student Loans This Way - Forbes\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2021/07/14/biden-cancelled-40-billion-of-student-loans-this-way/\nWed, 14 Jul 2021 16:30:58 GMT Here Are the Possible Winners and Losers in a Student Loan Proposal - The New York Times\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/16/upshot/student-loans-biden.html\nFri, 16 Jul 2021 09:00:17 GMT Student Loans Are Due Starting October 1, But Make Sure You Know The Answers To These 10 Questions - Forbes\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2021/07/12/student-loans-may-be-due-starting-october-1---here-are-answers-to-10-popular-questions/\nMon, 12 Jul 2021 23:08:58 GMT"], [28899, "2021-07-18T07:27:41Z", [0.05], ""], [28899, "2021-07-18T07:27:24Z", [0.03], ""], [95503, "2021-07-17T19:54:34Z", [0.02], ""], [56170, "2021-07-16T15:33:30Z", [0.03], ""], [55987, "2021-07-16T15:23:20Z", [0.02], ""], [70711, "2021-07-15T19:09:42Z", [0.0], ""], [99780, "2021-07-15T14:23:41Z", [0.03], ""], [87897, "2021-07-15T09:28:10Z", [0.02], ""], [59635, "2021-07-15T04:20:02Z", [0.01], ""], [87827, "2021-07-14T13:09:24Z", [0.03], ""], [100184, "2021-07-13T17:55:04Z", [0.1], ""], [101892, "2021-07-13T15:18:56Z", [0.0], "This is more likely closer to the midterms.

The WaPo reports that next week's budget leaves out any mention of student debt cancellation.[1]  My mistaken view was so strong based on my belief that Biden and his senior advisors had learned from Obama's failures of incrementalism.  I think that view holds but the politics are just not in their favor with the 50/50 Senate and the intransigence from Manchin and Synema to stop minority-rule in the Senate.  I did not give enough weight to their clearly enunciated views.  When I did consider them, I engaged in hand waving to believe those two could be persuaded \"some how.\" The absence of a health care public option and, more broadly, the lack of attention to health care in the budget, along with the exclusion of debt cancellation are harbingers of a tough 2022 mid-term election for the Dems, in my view.  All of this, plus the unlikelihood of passing the For The People Act, which overturns the most anti-democratic Red State laws, is a cascade from Joe Manchin's decision to oppose filibuster reform.  We are likely to see Speaker Kevin McCarthy thwart Biden's agenda for the final two years of his first term. Perhaps Biden is keeping this in his back pocket for executive action in September or October before the 2022 mid-term election in November if Congress does not take action, which is his clearly preferred choice.  Nonetheless, that will be outside the terms of reference for a \"yes\" on this question.

My reading of Klain\u2019s framing is that Biden will act when he has the views of Department of Education and Justice.  This DOE is clearly disposed to cancel debt, having already cleared $1 billion for defrauded students at for-profit schools.  The question is whether the DoJ\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel is more likely than not to side with those who believe the executive branch has authority on its own to cancel student debt apart from the legislature.  Executive branch lawyers tend to reflexively assert executive power.  The acting head of OLC Christopher Schroeder was brought back in after serving in the OLC under Obama and Clinton.  He was also a staffer for Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee.  This suggests he can be relied upon to be friendly to the mainstream of respectable Democratic views on the law.  I am guessing he will agree with all of those smart Harvard lawyers who say the president can cancel student debt on his own.

Biden does not he believe he has that authority but that is immaterial. A bunch of lefties do (Warren, Schumer, etc.), citing alleged authority under the higher education act of 1965. Legal experts (https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertfarrington/2020/12/17/can-biden-really-forgive-student-loans-by-executive-order/?sh=ad425281eed5) think it is ambiguous and likely to be challenged if the executive order is implemented.\n- Biden will ask Merrick Garland to review the law in coordination with his policy committee once Garland is appointed. They will come to a judgement. Then they will debate the policy.\n- If it does not become passed via executive order, it may be passed via Budget Reconciliation. The dems have one more shot at Budget reconciliation after the current bill. TLDR: There are two ways this question could resolve in the affirmative. I don't think either is really likely but they each have a chance. Biden is putting the executive order through a process, so I suspect we will get an honest legal judgment. Then they will debate the merits of doing an executive order and I am pretty sure they will determine that it will be challenged in court and risky. I give this a 10% chance.  The Budget Reconciliation bill is feasible but depends on the support of Joe Manchin, but we don't know where he stands.

A: Biden is planning to call on Congress to pass legislation providing $10,000 in student loan relief for every borrower.

Still gets me to 39% overall if I have done my maths right but could change materially in early Jan."], [88452, "2020-12-22T19:56:33Z", [0.94], ""], [11430, "2020-12-22T18:35:26Z", [0.95], "Perfect followup to post covid support."], [68240, "2020-12-22T17:24:32Z", [0.4], "So I think there is a decent chance that this will happen. However, I think part of that is that it may happen through legislation. The odds of this executive order occurring on the stated timeline depend heavily on how stimulus negotiations go once Biden comes into office. Precedent from 2008, when Obama came in, suggests that a measure like a stimulus bill which is both good for the economy and something that the GOP could blame the Dems for, will not face stiff congressional opposition and it would not surprise me if this measure makes its way into the stimulus bill. However that itself depends on who controls the Senate since there is a difference between McConnell not vigorously opposing something and actively working towards it. Even if it doesn't get done in the stimulus, if the stimulus meets enough democratic priorities I suspect Biden will not feel pressured to use unilateral executive action on a measure that most policy wonks consider to be a band-aid solution and bad for the institution of the presidency.  However, if there is mounted congressional opposition to debt forgiveness and the stimulus bill does not go far enough by economists and democratic leaders standards I believe there is a strong chance of this happening. A lot of Democratic heavyweights have lined up behind this idea (NAACP, teachers unions, Schumer, and Clayburn) and should the stimulus come short I doubt Biden will stay in the way of his party. TLDR: the probability of loan forgiveness is probably 55%, the specific probability of loan forgiveness through executive action is 40%. Pay close attention to how stimulus negotiations go and if the Dems take the senate. If the dems take the senate then the probability drops.
