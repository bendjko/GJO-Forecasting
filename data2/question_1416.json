China\u2019s interim efforts to obtain soybeans from other parties may also decrease their use of soybeans to address their agricultural commitment under Phase 1. Soybeans are an important component of any leverage China has in these negotiations for both their political and economic impact, both because of their role in key states in the U.S. farm economy, and because China typically consumes just under one-third of the global soybean crop and accounts for about two-thirds of the world\u2019s trade in soybeans.  http://www.startribune.com/soybean-prices-won-t-recover-in-2020-regardless-of-china-trade-talks-economist/566129121/ Soybeans were one of China\u2019s first retaliatory targets, along with aluminum, airplanes, cars, and pork, and it appears the Phase 1 deal leaves China discretion in continuing its approach to exemptions and waivers, and does not directly address tariffs on these items.

It also said that US cars and car parts would continue to be exempted from existing duties.\nChina hoped it could continue to \u201cwork with the US on the basis of equality and mutual respect to address the concerns of both parties and promote the steady development of the China-US trade relations\u201d, it said.\nDuring the negotiations for a \u201cphase one\u201d deal, Beijing repeatedly called for the suspension of any tariff increases by the US on Chinese products and for existing duties to be lifted.\nAfter weeks of debate and deliberation, Washington on Friday halted its plan to introduce fresh tariffs on the remaining US$100 billion worth of Chinese goods that were exempt from the punitive action, and said it would halve its existing duties on about US$120 billion of Chinese imports to 7.5 per cent.\nHowever, a 25 per cent tariff on about US$250 billion worth of Chinese goods would remain in place, it said. Besides the removal of tariffs, the US said the \u201chistoric and enforceable\u201d phase one deal would require China to make structural and other changes to its economic and trade regime in the areas of intellectual property, technology transfer, agriculture, financial services, and currency and foreign exchange.\n\u201cThe phase one agreement also includes a commitment by China that it will make substantial additional purchases of US goods and services in the coming years,\u201d the trade representative\u2019s office said (Para. 1-9).\n\\\nReference\n\\\nTang, F.

It comes after U.S. President Donald Trump spoke on Thursday of the possibility of an \u201cinterim trade deal\u201d over the coming weeks. Beijing will allow Chinese businesses to purchase a \u201ccertain amount of farm products such as soybeans and pork\u201d from the United States, according to the Xinhua report. \u201cChina\u2019s market is big enough and there\u2019s great potential to import high-quality U.S. farm products.\u201d It added that Chinese authorities hoped that \u201cthe U.S. will honor its word and fulfil its promises to create favorable conditions for cooperation for the two countries in the agriculture sector\u201d. Hua Changchun, an economist at Guotai Junan Securities, a brokerage, said Beijing's move has increased the likelihood of a narrow trade deal (Para. 1-6). \u201cBut it's a small deal,\u201d Hua said. \u201cIt means that there would be no escalation of tariffs as China has agreed to make more purchases. It could provide a certain level of comfort to U.S. farmers and give Trump something to brag about.\u201d It marks the latest in series of rapid-fire developments this week that suggest a concerted effort by China to push for a partial, or interim, trade deal (Para 1-7). China has also imposed 30 per cent in tariffs on yellow soybeans \u2014 the sort the U.S. grows in abundance \u2014 including 25 percent in June and 5 per cent on September 1, bringing the current tariff level to 33 per cent. If the additional tariffs are removed, tariffs on U.S. soybeans would return to 3 percent \u2014 the same rate paid by importers of Brazilian soybeans, which have largely filled the gap left by the U.S (Xin, 2019.

China traditionally sources U.S. soybeans in the fourth quarter of the year when U.S. produce dominates the market. But American cargoes plunged after Beijing slapped hefty tariffs in 2018 on a list of U.S. goods including soybeans in a tit-for-tat trade war (Para. 9). Chinese importers later resumed purchases of U.S. beans during a truce in the trade war and after Beijing issued extra tariff-free waivers for some American shipments. China customs vice minister Zou Zhiwu noted on Tuesday that soybean and pork imports had rebounded significantly in December. China and the United States have agreed an initial, or Phase 1, trade deal, which is expected to be signed on Jan. 15. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Sunday he expected China to buy $40 billion to $50 billion of agricultural products under the deal.

My previous forecast rationale: https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/934917 My updated forecast is based on the following: 1) The Phase 1 deal announcement seems like an interim ceasefire on tariffs and a \u2018wait and see\u2019 until after the November 2020 election: China didn\u2019t commit to specific tariff reductions under the agreement but instead has vowed to exempt certain U.S. products from its duties in order to meet the purchasing targets laid out in the deal. Trump administration has no current plans to lift the more than $360 billion worth of tariffs it has levied against China since 2018 despite the Phase 1 agreement. There are no other oral agreements between US and China for a future reduction in tariffs. The joint statement, first given to Bloomberg reported that tariffs wouldn\u2019t be removed before the presidential election in November 2020. 2) Even the talks leading up to the Phase 1 deal were said, at the time, by some to have been hyped up (SCMP Dec 27th 2019): \u201cWhile the so-called phase one trade deal was largely viewed as face-saving optics in a time of crisis, experts agreed it was far from enough to end the protracted trade war, dissolve deep-running tensions or undo the damage caused to both countries and the global economy.\u201d SCMP Dec 27th 2019. 3) US soybean harvest season has largely passed: As @Ikresnak and others have mentioned in previous comments, \u201cHarvest season in the US is largely passed, but the end of this question coincides with South Americas harvest season.\u201d China knows it has a weakness in too much reliance on the US, so they will continue to find other sources to reduce their reliance on the US soybean market. One reason why China could reduce or remove tariffs on US soybeans before 1 May 2020 is because of the pressure Trump may feel in an election year to get a deal, however, after the Phase 1 agreement announced Jan 15, 2020, this is looking significantly less likely - especially before 1 May 2020. 4) Difference between goodwill gesture and a concession:  Both Trump and Xi have said that the tariff exemptions and waivers that they gave to each other in 2019 (apparently because they acknowledged that both economies were hurting) were goodwill gestures and not a concession. I\u2019m not sure about Trump, but China doesn't seem the country to concede - they won\u2019t want to lose face. \"The biggest thing is not to appear to be capitulating to the US\" said Yun Jiang, a Chinese policy analyst. So one shouldn\u2019t overreact to a goodwill gesture by viewing it a sign that tariff reductions or removals will take place shortly after. 5) China has previously demanded \u201ccomplete removal\" of tariffs: China has demanded the \u201ccomplete removal\" of tariffs. It's not known if this is a mandatory/non-negotiable prerequisite from China, but apparently Trump says China's request for \"complete removal\" is a non-starter for the US in trade negotiations. On Friday, November 8, US President Donald Trump told reporters, \u201cChina would like to get somewhat of a rollback, not a complete rollback because they know I won\u2019t do it.\u201d What happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object? This is what makes me think that it's less likely that a significant trade accord will get signed any time soon, let alone the reduction or removal of contentious US soybean tariffs before 1 May 2020. 6) During negotiations and prep for Phase 1, China was said to be reviewing tariff \u201cexemptions\u201d (not \u201creductions\u201d or \u201cremovals\u201d): Prior to the Phase 1 deal, a government source said that China was \"reviewing tariff exemptions on $60 billion worth of US goods\". Note that it didn't say reviewing tariff \"reductions\" or tariff \"removals\" 7) Buying more US agricultural products doesn't automatically necessitate that tariffs will be reduced or removed, especially when China may not need to remove or reduce soybean tariffs because the Chinese government can circumnavigate them using other means: Although it is reasonable to expect that China might reduce or remove tariffs on the basis of an agreement to buy more US agricultural products, it still doesn't guarantee that soybeans will be included among the \"US agricultural products\" that are being mentioned in this Phase 1 deal. Nor does it guarantee that tariff reductions or removals will happen before 1 May 2020. China may not need to reduce or remove tariffs in order to buy more agricultural products because they can, and have been, importing the soybeans on behalf of the private companies (i.e. the government does the buying and sells the soybeans onto the end-user). So essentially the government is using state-owned firms to buy soybeans that are exempt from the tariffs and in doing so they are circumnavigating the tariffs that private companies would otherwise be obliged to pay. 8) \"China is using its tariff on US soybean as a weapon in the trade war\" (Forbes 2019): Considering the fact that government entities can avoid their own duties, US soybeans are not priced out of the market. Rather, it\u2019s more likely China is using soy as a weapon in its trade war arsenal and will continue to do so as long as tariffs are in place (Forbes, May 2019). 9) China is likely to keep the Soybean card for negotiation later: As @pofto alluded to in an earlier comment; since China has imposed other tariffs on US imported goods as part of the Trade War, it\u2019s reasonable to see how these other tariffs would be removed or reduced well before China plays there biggest card and reduced or removes tariffs on US soybeans, especially before the 1 May 2020 deadline of this question. Yao Xinchao, professor of international trade at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing was quoted saying \"Pork and soybeans are two important bargaining chips that China won't play easily\".  10) Tax exemptions and waivers are more likely: It has become increasingly likely that China will handle the trade war with Trump through a tax exemption or waivers, which are excluded from the resolution of the question. A Bloomberg article on Dec 24th 2019 mentioned: \"China will provide retaliatory tariff waivers to buyers of U.S. farm products on a more regular basis after the countries reached a phase one trade deal, according to people familiar with the situation. Waivers had previously been given in tranches but they\u2019ll now be handed out more frequently. The move will make it less punitive for Chinese companies to purchase U.S. goods that are still subject to retaliatory trade tariffs and thereby help Beijing meet any commitments it has made as part of a trade deal.\" 11) There is an argument that the reason why China won\u2019t reduce or remove US soybean tariffs anytime soon is that it\u2019s politically motivated: Sources say that China is being strategic with its retaliatory tariffs, targeting industries in states which President Trump won in 2016, making it more politically difficult for the President to continue his trade war. China knows that this represents a point of leverage: the trade war is playing out in the American heartland ahead of an election year. According to Forbes, a Chinese government official said: \"It\u2019s like election meddling\". Some say China is betting on two Democratic Party candidates to be in their corner; Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are considered pro-Wall Street on China. A Biden or Harris victory might be great news for China, but some say that they are the only bet within the current crop of top 5 Democratic Party candidates that would be seen as a return to status quo trade relations. Farmers might bet that way too. For these reasons, I\u2019m even less sure that China will reduce or remove any tariffs imposed on U.S. yellow soybeans before 1 May 2020."], [19106, "2020-01-15T23:00:05Z", [0.05], "The text of the agreement contains no commitment to remove or lower tariffs, and in fact uses the word \"tariff\" only twice!

It is unlikely that China will give up this weapon before the ending of the trade war with the U.S. Tariffs play an important role in a free market economy as they encourage buyers to seek alternative cheaper (with no tariff) sources.  However China's economy is not completely free.  There is a strong state-controlled component to it.  The Chinese authoritarian government could easily reduce an import by just demanding it to happen, instead of imposing tariffs.  Imposing tariffs on US imports is just a simple way to show its tit for tat strategy.  Tariffs do not mean much as it can demand a reduction of an import (even though it may be cheaper) and/or has lots of tariff exemptions and waivers (as it is frequently done). It is unlikely that a tariff reduction or removal on soybeans will be in the Phase 1 agreement, which is rumored to be signed in the next few days.

This development does not necessarily mean China will reduce or remove the tariff's currently levied on soybean imports.  In early December the Chinese demonstrated a willingness to waive the tariff, but removal is another step and another chess piece in ongoing trade negotiations.  China's removal or reduction of tariffs will be part of the larger trade negotiations rather just a soybean supply and demand issue.  There is a crop timing aspect to consider for both countries and  According to a Reuters article on the Successful Farming website, the Chinese have eased regulations on soybean imports coming across their northern border with Kazakhstan and Russia.  Though neither of these countries can currently make up for the U.S. volume or the anticipated Chinese demand, it does signal an effort to expand their potential soybean trading partners over the long term (potential mitigation for leaving tariffs in place and granting waivers only).  Brazil has been the big winner in the current soybean market, increasing their exports to China over 2019.  The latest Chinese waivers have seen a slight shift back toward the U.S. and away from Brazil.  October through December is the prime harvest period for U.S. soybeans, while Brazil is planting soybeans during this period (http://www.soybeansandcorn.com/Brazil-Crop-Cycles).  An agreement to reduce or remove tariffs on US soybean would have a higher impact in Jan when the agreement is due to be signed.   According to multiple news sites, President trump will sign the agreement on 15 January.  The deal reportedly includes Chinese agreement to buy more U.S. Farm products, and according to some sites roll back the September tariffs.  According to Salvatore Babones writing for Foreign Policy, the phase one deal notes U.S. tariffs from September will be rolled back by half, but original tariffs will remain in force.   This provides a potential justification for rolling back at least one phase tariffs as a quid pro quo for U.S. changes.  Though none of the sources noted thus far include a specific change to the Chinese soybean tariff, it is a logical inclusion.  The timing of the agreement, the increased orders, and the timing of the northern hemisphere crop sales all point to at least some changes in the tariff structure.  \n"], [40584, "2020-01-03T05:21:25Z", [0.85], ""], [40584, "2020-01-03T05:20:30Z", [0.75], ""], [2030, "2020-01-03T03:02:22Z", [0.8], ""], [3429, "2020-01-02T20:18:29Z", [0.5], "Raising forecast but still maintain low level of confidence in the capability of the US and China delegations agreeing."], [10039, "2020-01-02T19:33:21Z", [0.85], ""], [78126, "2020-01-02T19:26:12Z", [1.0], ""], [691, "2020-01-02T13:08:38Z", [0.73], ""], [80475, "2020-01-02T01:38:12Z", [0.94], ""], [43311, "2020-01-02T01:12:37Z", [1.0], "@ravel is @username-deleted 688 100% on that one.

The so-called Phase 1 deal that the two sides announced Dec. 13 did manage to de-escalate the standoff and offer at least a respite to American farmers. Yet the truce put off for future negotiations the toughest and most complex issue at the heart of the trade war: The Trump administration's assertion that Beijing cheats in its drive to achieve global supremacy in such advanced technologies as driver-less cars and artificial intelligence (Para. 9). The administration says \u2014 and independent analysts generally agree \u2014 that China steals technology, forces foreign companies to hand over trade secrets, unfairly subsidizes its own firms and throws up bureaucratic hurdles for foreign rivals. Beijing has rejected the accusations and contended that the administration is instead trying to suppress a rising competitor in international trade. Under the preliminary U.S.-China deal, Trump suspended his plan to impose new tariffs and reduced some existing taxes on Chinese imports. In return, Lighthizer said, China agreed to buy $40 billion a year in U.S. farm exports over two years, among other things. (Beijing also committed to ending its long-standing practice of pressuring foreign companies to hand over their technology as a condition of gaining access to the Chinese market (Para. 9- 11)).\n*\nReference\n* Kunk, J., Wiseman, P. & McDonald, J.

My unchanged update is mainly due to the fourth (4th) commandment: \"Strike the right balance between under- and overreacting to evidence\". I may have underreacted in light of the new phase one deal, but here's my rationale: 1. The question clearly states that: \"Tariff exemptions and waivers would not count toward the resolution of the question.\" China has declined to disclose details of the scale of tariff reduction and about what they have agreed as part of Phase 1. So far, only the US has announced that the US has agreed to cancel the planned December tariffs and reduce some of their existing tariffs on the basis that China will \"buy more US agriculture products\" but there has been no suggestion of \"tariff reductions\" from China in return. Recently, waivers/exemptions have been issued by China that allows for another 2 million tonnes in purchases without the extra tariffs. But, again, these are not tariff reductions. Additionally, China's act to \"exempt certain products\" (which China said was designed to ease the dispute's impact on American companies) does not offer relief from tariffs on the big-ticket agricultural products such as soybeans and corn that are causing the most hurt in the US. \"Pork and soybeans are two important bargaining chips that China won't play easily\" said  Yao Xinchao, professor of international trade at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing.  2. Trump is demanding that China buys 50 billion worth of agriculture products \"pretty soon\". China will not be rushing into anything any time soon. It could be very difficult for China to buy this amount given the current circumstances. These targets are difficult and China will be very careful not to commit to anything because it could put China into a difficult position with existing trade partners. It's more likely that the purchases of US agricultural products will be decided by market prices. Even if China agrees to try and buy the amount of US agricultural products that Trump wants China to buy, China is still unlikely to commit to reducing or removing tariffs - imposed specifically on U.S. yellow soybeans - unless they can be very sure it will be beneficial for them to do so. China knows that Trump could simply reimpose tariffs on a whim and then China would be stuck with large purchases or contracts with US suppliers and their products. Instead, China is saying that any deal \"needs to be mutually beneficial\", hence China's concerns about rushing in to sign anything too quickly. Trump recently said it was possible an agreement might not be reached until after the election in November 2020, while the Chinese foreign ministry said Beijing did not have a deadline for reaching a deal. For the above reasons, I forecast that, based on current evidence, it is still unlikely that China will reduce or remove any tariffs imposed on U.S. yellow soybeans before 1 May 2020."], [1333, "2019-12-17T19:33:22Z", [0.85], ""], [18322, "2019-12-17T07:38:06Z", [0.92], ""], [691, "2019-12-16T14:38:42Z", [0.7], ""], [67246, "2019-12-16T11:45:52Z", [0.8], ""], [80179, "2019-12-16T04:04:17Z", [0.75], ""], [172, "2019-12-15T20:54:10Z", [0.99], ""], [691, "2019-12-15T18:02:44Z", [0.68], ""], [691, "2019-12-14T20:08:46Z", [0.56], ""], [27661, "2019-12-14T16:12:30Z", [0.81], ""], [55706, "2019-12-14T12:33:02Z", [0.75], ""], [81061, "2019-12-14T05:42:59Z", [0.5], ""], [75863, "2019-12-14T03:48:25Z", [0.95], ""], [64582, "2019-12-14T02:14:59Z", [0.45], ""], [77718, "2019-12-13T19:02:44Z", [0.75], "compromise boost for election"], [78336, "2019-12-13T16:49:30Z", [0.98], ""], [59836, "2019-12-13T15:21:25Z", [1.0], ""], [1333, "2019-12-13T15:17:14Z", [0.75], ""], [691, "2019-12-13T14:39:36Z", [0.46], ""], [27661, "2019-12-13T10:28:28Z", [0.67], "Latest news indicate considerable progress (at least in rhetoric - again) towards a Phase 1 agreement [1].

Thus, the first issue that arises is if there will be a Phase 1 agreement. This does not seem far fetched from a rational point of view. Both parties have an interest in coming to an agreement, in particular the Republican-led US side that hopes to rely upon positive news about the economy for the next election campaign - regardless of the current rhetoric [5]. Therefore, the pressure on the US negotiators will rise continuously - at least up to the point Republicans rely upon economic successes as main reelection argument. If a possible agreement does not satisfy US demands, they could also focus on the argument they used to legitimize the trade dispute in the first place: China as malicious actor and threat to the US. The second issue that arises is if there will be a Phase 1 agreement before 1 May 2020. In general, there have already been several annoucements indicating an agreement is close to completion [7]. However, the absence of an agreement indicates that there are still major technical issues to be sorted out [8] (- or issues of political strategy?). As it is the main challenge for both sides to not loose face in an agreement, neither can accept a result that strongly hurt their legitimacy domestically. That said, China may accept that it cannot win the trade war [9, 11] - or whatever you may call a result in the end [10]. While the pressure seems to increase more on the US side as the election approaches, China can neither move as far away from its core positions the US would like them to do nor allow themselves to insist on a position that would be perceived as a US defeat by the US public. Otherwise, Trump may indeed follow through with his current rhetoric of not needing an agreement in 2020 [5,6]. If the new tariffs kick in December 15, 2019 or are postponed may be a sign in what direction the talks are going in the coming months. All in all, I assume there will be a Phase 1 agreement and it's likely to consist of the reduction or even removal of tariffs on US soybeans but I'm pessimistic that it will be implemented before 1 May 2020. It may, however, be the case that the time frame to come to an agreement will have already been forfeited by then. Let's see if the new tariffs kick in on Sunday or not.

Therefore, if continued trade tensions are the base case I don\u2019t think the US will give up its leverage and China will continue to find other sources. A significant trade resolution (addressing some or all structural issues) is needed for the US to lift soybean tariffs in my opinion.
