On the contrary, they appear be standing their ground. Yesterday, on January 8, 2022, The Confidencial reported: \"In her first daily discourse of 2022, first lady and vice president Rosario Murillo declared that the inauguration ceremony would take place in Managua\u2019s Plaza of the Revolution. 'We\u2019ll all take the oath, the oath of the people\u2019s presidency,' she expounded.\" Further, the opposition's plan appears to be a civil one, as opposed to something resembling a coup. Civil action takes time to develop and transpire, leaving little room for anything substantial to happen in the next 48 hours. The only conceivable thwart to Ortega's taking the oath and serving as President in the next few days would appear at this time to be something extreme and drastic, such as nationwide rioting, looting, and violence (unlikely, given the opposition's admonition to the populace to stay home), or an assassination attempt on Ortega's life. While such an attempt on his life is not entirely out of the question, its success seems unlikely, given the extra precautions and protection his regime will likely be making at the moment, in light of all the unrest. President Anastasio Somoza Debayle of Nicaragua was assassinated in 1980, but he was in exile in Paraguay at the time, and in any event a single case is not enough to use to make a prediction about Ortega's future. There are plenty of documented assassination attempts on Fidel Castro, but the comparison is not  quite apropos; he was a different leader in a different country in a very different period of history. Conclusion: Barring a fluke event, there is almost no chance that Daniel Ortega ceases to be the president of Nicaragua by 11 January 2022."], [1785, "2022-01-09T17:59:31Z", [0.0], "He is ensconced and it will take months of protest if they ever start."], [62808, "2022-01-08T19:35:41Z", [0.0], ""], [102641, "2022-01-08T16:03:46Z", [0.0], ""], [100273, "2022-01-08T01:54:18Z", [0.0], "Duh"], [95112, "2022-01-07T23:57:17Z", [0.0], ""], [37236, "2022-01-07T20:20:27Z", [0.0], ""], [96541, "2022-01-06T20:21:29Z", [0.0], ""], [40636, "2022-01-06T08:21:32Z", [0.0], ""], [767, "2022-01-06T02:38:30Z", [0.0], "Ortega recently seized the Taiwan embassy in Nicaragua to give it to China (who is opening their first embassy there since 1990) and strengthened ties with Russia sending a mission led by his two sons to discuss investments and economic cooperation in early December. \nHis government continues to deny there is a Covid crisis and has violated the transparency agreements it had agreed to in order to obtain a $185.4 million in loans to address the pandemic which it received the IMF, the World Bank and the InterAmerican Development Bank.

It is very questionable if the elections on 7 Nov 2021 will be free and fair, and if Ortega will resign if he were to lose. Still there could be certain momentum initiated around the elections that could become Ortega\u2019s downfall. Likelihood ~5%.  B.\tDeath/ sickness. Due to Ortega being above the national life expectancy and having known health issue there is a possibility of him dying or becoming incapicated before 11 Jan 2022. Likelihood ~5%.  C.\tForeign military intervention. A foreign military intervention in Nicaragua is not on the table. Especially not with the Biden administration in the White house. Likelihood <1%.  D.\tCoup d\u2019etat. In 2018 Nicaragua experienced nationwide protests and a dynamic emerged where a coup could have taken place. This did not happen though, and the Ortega regime has since made sure to promote loyalists within the armed forces. Likelihood 1%.  E.\tSteps down voluntary. Ortega could have stepped down voluntarily during the protests a few years ago, or when his presidential term limit reached its end the first time. Likelihood 1%.  F.\tImpeachment. It is unclear whether something similar to impeachment exists in Nicaragua, it has been calls for impeachment in the past though. Due to Ortega\u2019s control of the parliament (71 out of 92 members belongs to his party) it is very unlikely that any impeachment attempts would be successful now.  Things could thoretically change after the elections in November though if he wins the presidency but loses the parliament. Likelihood 1%.  Alternatives A-F add up to a 13% likelihood that Ortega will cease to be the president of Nicaragua before 11 January 2022. Factors to keep an eye on is how the general election turns out, the Covid-19 situation and the loyalty of the security forces.
