Therefore, it is completely unforeseeable that her support could more than double in the next few days.  Neither Buttigieg nor Klobuchar have much mobilization in Nevada and the latest poll shows them at only 10%, it is likely that this support will grow on election day, especially with a good debate performance and a bad performance by Biden. Therefore, it's possible one of them is able to break away and it's hard to understand how much support they really have due to a lack of polling.  Tom Steyer is a little bit of a dark horse as he has really been in the race, but has focused on Nevada and South Carolina, however polls show significant support for Steyer and so it foreseeable that he is able to come out of the woodwork with a surprise win in Nevada, especially considering  the lack of polling could be under representing his support. Biden still is polling decently in Nevada, although support has significantly dropped since his terrible Iowa and NH performance. However, it can be assured that Biden's campaign is pushing hard for a good finish in Nevada, while other campaigns are likely going to cut their losses there i.e. Warren, Klobuchar and Buttigieg and start focusing on the Super Tuesday States. Biden's support however has typically been over represented by polls, and the polls in the past month have shown him at under 20%, when around 25% is needed to win a state. But he could still possibly win Nevada, a good debate performance is key though.  The latest poll does show Bernie winning at above the margin of error and with support at the crucial 25% mark. Moreover, Bernie has the momentum going into Nevada and has a huge operating staff there that will easily be able to out canvass any other candidate. Moreover, when voting statistics from Iowa and NH are broken down, Bernie captures a surprising majority of hispanic voters, who are of course a huge demographic in Nevada. Therefore, as is typically the case with minorities and polling data, it is likely that Bernie's support in the polls is underrepresented.

Unfortunately, there has been no polling of Nevada since Jan. 14 [3]. The results of the most recent poll on Jan. 14 (conducted by Suffolk University, which has an A+ rating from FiveThirtyEight) showed Biden at 19%, Sanders at 18%, Warren at 11%, Buttigieg at 8%, and Steyer at 8% [4]. In terms of second-choice preference (which is important because Nevada has a caucus system where a 15% threshold must be reached for viability): Warren is at 21%, Biden is at 19%, and Sanders is at 12% [4].  Given his recent victories in Iowa and New Hampshire, Sanders has probably surpassed Biden - though Biden almost certainly remains very competitive. Warren and Buttigieg are probably also competitive, though to to a lesser extent. My understanding of the situation largely aligns with the probabilities that FiveThirtyEight's model gives (Sanders 71% Biden 16%, Buttigieg 11%, Warren 7%), though with less strength given to Sanders's position due to his campaign's spat with the Culinary Workers Union.
