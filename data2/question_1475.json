YouGov and Emerson College will be releasing their poll findings later this Sunday.  I had a thought in terms of forecasting methodology with regards to a question like this:  Theoretically, all the candidates have a shot at winning, which can be expressed by some percentage derived from a probabilistic assessment, but practically, are not the chances even narrower? Momentum leading up to a vote on top of the candidate's base of support are, and this is a tautology, determinative of who will win. Sanders and Biden have the momentum and the base right, so, as a practical question, it's between those two. Theoretically, yes, Elizabeth Warren could win. Yet, for the other theoretical conditions to  be practically viable, there would have to be movement towards Warren, coupled with a dampening of enthusiasm for Biden, Sanders and Buttigieg, which has not happened. When you add on the threshold issue, which @SmellsLikeCake has spoken about, Buttigieg gets thrown into the mix as a dark horse. In short, where I betting, I would not spread my bets to include Warren.  In other words, if you had $100 to bet, would you spread your bets out or would you concentrate them where theory had led you to believe chances are greater and where pragmatism dictates the result is likely to be. Or less abstractly, there is some chance that tomorrow Martians could invade the earth, that chance could be 99%, with Martians just taking off for earth, but not having access to the counsels of the Martians, or even knowing if there are any, it is a waste of resources, going by historical evidence, to prepare for a Martian invasion."], [67844, "2020-02-02T10:30:58Z", [0.49, 0.0, 0.51, 0.0, 0.0], "Comment deleted on Feb 02, 2020 10:54AM UTC"], [29469, "2020-02-02T09:44:05Z", [0.14, 0.05, 0.8, 0.01, 0.0], ""], [19127, "2020-02-02T06:51:21Z", [0.53, 0.03, 0.38, 0.06, 0.0], ""], [81502, "2020-02-02T06:00:51Z", [0.26, 0.08, 0.56, 0.06, 0.04], ""], [80749, "2020-02-02T03:45:11Z", [0.33, 0.22, 0.27, 0.18, 0.0], "Polls show Biden and Sanders pulling ahead of Buttigieg and Warren[1].

Bernie Sanders has gained ground in the Democratic presidential race and is now tied with former Vice President Joe Biden among the party\u2019s primary voters nationally, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll has found. Mr. Sanders was the first choice of 27% of Democratic primary voters, essentially tied with Mr. Biden, who had 26%. Mr. Biden led in all previous Journal/NBC News polls of the 2020 primary race. Sen. Elizabeth Warren slipped to a distant third place, with 15% support. In the prior two surveys, she was about even with Mr. Sanders for second place. Mr. Sanders has gained support by drawing voters from Ms. Warren, the poll found. (See the poll results.) The results suggest a substantial reordering of the race in the days before Democrats kick off the presidential nominating process with Monday\u2019s caucuses in Iowa, where several recent surveys show Mr. Sanders vying with Mr. Biden for the lead. The survey also finds that Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, has jumped into fourth place nationally on the strength of an ad barrage costing $280 million so far, according to the political-ad tracker Kantar/CMAG. Some 60% of Democratic primary voters have seen a Bloomberg ad, the new poll found, far more than have seen ads by any other candidate. Mr. Bloomberg had 9% support nationally in the survey. Former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg drew 7%, while Sen. Amy Klobuchar had 5% and Andrew Yang, 4%. The Journal/NBC News poll surveyed 428 registered voters who said they would vote in a Democratic presidential primary or caucus. The poll was conducted Jan. 26-29 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.74 percentage points. The poll revealed a sharp generational divide in the nominating contest. Mr. Sanders held his largest lead ever\u2014a nearly-30-point advantage\u2014over Mr. Biden among primary voters under age 50, and he led by nearly 40 points among the youngest voters, those under age 35. Mr. Biden, by contrast, led Mr. Sanders by 25 points among people ages 50 and older. \u201cSanders has this unique political standing with younger voters that is actually strengthening, and there\u2019s not much sign that he\u2019s making a dent with older primary voters,\u2019\u2019 said Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster who conducted the survey with Jeff Horwitt, a Democrat. One danger for Mr. Biden is that older voters also account for much of the newfound strength of Mr. Bloomberg, who is the first choice of 14% of those ages 50 and up. \u201cBloomberg is the Moby Dick in this race, and his presence is just starting to be felt,\u2019\u2019 said Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster who also worked on the survey. Mr. McInturff said perceptions of Mr. Bloomberg have improved since December, when more than half of Democratic primary voters said they had reservations about him or were very uncomfortable with his candidacy. Less than one-third in December said they were enthusiastic about Mr. Bloomberg or were comfortable with him. In the new survey, Mr. Bloomberg elicited more favorable views, and the share of people who said they were comfortable equaled those who were uncomfortable. Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s massive ad buy, Mr. McInturff said, \u201chas bought something.\u201d Mr. Bloomberg isn\u2019t competing in Iowa or the other three states that vote in February, hoping instead to make his mark in those that hold primaries and caucuses just afterward and that will award far more convention delegates. The survey found Mr. Biden retaining a number of strengths in the primary contest. African-Americans remained a core pillar of his support, with 52% naming him as their top choice, up from 46% in the summer. That positions Mr. Biden well in such states as South Carolina, where about 60% of voters are black. Mr. Biden had the edge over Mr. Sanders when voters were asked for their second choice for presidential nominee, a factor that could prove important if Iowa and New Hampshire play their traditional role of winnowing the field. Asked for their second-choice candidate, 24% in the survey named Ms. Warren, while 20% picked Mr. Biden and 15% named Mr. Sanders. Of the two leading candidates, however, Mr. Sanders had firmer support. Some 90% of those who named him as their first choice said they would definitely or probably vote for him, including 60% who said their support was definite. Among Biden supporters, by contrast, 70% said they would definitely or probably stick with him, with 48% saying their support was definite. Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren have been competing through the primary season for a similar set of liberal voters. Combined, the two candidates have been the top choice of about 40% of Democratic primary voters since September. But the contours of their support have changed. Support for Mr. Sanders has grown since December among African- Americans, as well as among voters under age 50 and women who don\u2019t have a four-year college degree. Ms. Warren\u2019s support has declined since December among those groups. The same is true for the party\u2019s core, progressive voters\u2014those who call themselves both strong Democrats and very liberal. For Ms. Warren, the signs of a potential rebound included her status as the top second-choice candidate. In addition, she retains a positive image within the party. Two-thirds of primary voters say they are enthusiastic about or comfortable with her candidacy, and less than one-third said they were uncomfortable with it\u2014about the same as for Messrs. Biden and Sanders. The new Journal/NBC survey found that climate change was animating the votes of many Democrats. When poll respondents were asked whether any single issue was so important that it would determine their vote, 33% cited climate change, while 12% said gun regulations and 11% cited abortion. Other responses were in single digits. Some 30% said they were not single-issue voters. The generational divide among Democrats could become a defining feature of the primary race. The poll illustrated the difference between older and younger Democrats by asking their views of capitalism and socialism. Sanders voters held a substantially positive view of socialism and a negative view of capitalism, while Biden voters held a slightly negative view of socialism and a positive view of capitalism. Those same patterns appeared when Democrats were divided by age: The youngest voters saw socialism in a positive light, and older voters saw capitalism in a positive light. Among Sanders voters, positive views of socialism outweighed negative views by a net 56 percentage points, 60% to 4%. Among Biden voters, negative views outweighed positive ones by a net 4 points, 35% to 31%. With Sanders voters, negative views of capitalism outweighed positive ones by a net 36 percentage points, while Biden voters held a positive view by a net 14 percentage points.\u201c"], [81500, "2020-01-31T17:53:38Z", [0.47, 0.05, 0.45, 0.03, 0.0], ""], [63835, "2020-01-31T17:26:17Z", [0.76, 0.0, 0.24, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [78237, "2020-01-31T17:15:40Z", [0.34, 0.16, 0.35, 0.1, 0.05], ""], [14432, "2020-01-31T16:51:54Z", [0.45, 0.05, 0.45, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [31251, "2020-01-31T16:21:34Z", [0.41, 0.06, 0.47, 0.05, 0.01], ""], [63290, "2020-01-31T15:03:47Z", [0.4, 0.0, 0.6, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [81365, "2020-01-31T14:34:45Z", [0.49, 0.02, 0.48, 0.01, 0.0], "I'm adjusting my forecast to increase %'s for Biden and Sanders.

This has a good chance of changing this year because we're going to have 4, possibly 5 candidates emerge out of Iowa with double-digit showings. Unless someone emerges in the next few weeks with a clear lead and Kerry '04, Obama '08-margin it won't mean much by March other than expectations met or not met. Traditionally there have been 3 tickets out of Iowa, we may have as many as 5 this time. Two major polling aggregators show this (once accounting for MoE), at:\nhttps://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/ia/iowa_democratic_presidential_caucus-6731.html AND \nhttps://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-the-first-post-debate-polls-are-in-and-theyre-pretty-weird/ Both aggregations show Sen. Sanders as a slight favorite or tied for IA and NH. Sanders has a formidable field army of activists and volunteers which should help him outpace expectations. Playing against him however is the Senate impeachment trial which will take him, Sen. Warren, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar off the campaign trail in the coming weeks. Former VP Biden and now-former Mayor Pete Buttigieg will not have to face this challenge and can be on the ground in Iowa (and New Hampshire) until caucus day. This will boost their chances. I also think Sen. Klobuchar is showing some momentum and that the recent feud and bad blood between the Sanders and Warren campaigns will end up helping neither and hurting both.  If Sen. Sanders wins, he's got a great chance of winning the first two contests and emerging as the viable alternative to Biden, the current national front-runner.  If Pete Buttigieg or Sen. Klobuchar win that would upend the primary race the most. They both have the most to gain by winning and in many ways are all-in on Iowa. If they both exceed expectations, they'll play in the early primary states.  Joe Biden on the other hand does not need to win Iowa but should absolutely be treating it as a must-win because if Biden (ahead by 0.4 in the RCP aggregation) does win Iowa this race could be over sooner than many think right now.  Another key feature to keep in mind is the 15% threshold in the caucus and where candidates may not meet that threshold, not just the five mentioned here but the second choices of candidates like Andrew Yang, Tom Steyer, and Tulsi Gabbard.  Final Verdict:  Both Warren and Buttigieg peaked too early in Iowa, but Buttigieg has the time in the field and schedule to recover and outperform expectations. Since Buttigieg and Warren are competing for professional class voters in the same way Sanders and Warren are competing for more liberal/progressive-minded voters, she's competing on two fronts with not enough time down the stretch to do it. Of the three major contenders in the Senate implicated by the timing of the trial, Sen. Klobuchar will fair the best, with neighboring Minnesota and the many politically active and civic-minded people that hail from it, to help push Amy far above expectations. Outside of the winner, Amy will be the surprise and story of the night. The other story of the night will be that there are five tickets out of Iowa, but that Warren desperately will need a strong NH finish to stay viable.\n1. Sanders (narrow victory)\n2. Biden\n3.

First, Iowans take seriously their participation in the country\u2019s first contest. Both Selzer and Monmouth find around 40% have firmly made up their minds, but 45% in the Selzer poll say they \u201ccould be persuaded\u201d and 13% haven\u2019t made a choice. The comparable Monmouth numbers are 52% still \u201copen\u201d and 5% with no choice yet.\nSecond, Iowa Democratic Party rules say that if a caucus participant\u2019s preferred candidate doesn\u2019t receive 15% of the vote in the attendee\u2019s precinct, then he must chose another candidate or head home to await final results. Selzer finds 32% undecided or supporting candidates with less than 15% total support; Monmouth has around 26%. These voters\u2019 second-choice preferences are likely to be especially important.\nThe two recent polls provide conflicting guidance as to where these people will break when their candidates lose. Selzer says Ms. Warren gets 16% as a second choice, Mr. Buttigieg 15% and Messrs. Biden and Sanders 12% each. Monmouth finds that 23% pick Ms. Warren as their second choice, vaulting her to first place. Fifteen percent say Mr. Buttigieg is their second choice, 14% pick Mr. Sanders and only 10% choose Mr. Biden, the same percentage who would turn to Ms. Klobuchar.\nHow this plays out depends on which candidates lack 15% in which of the state\u2019s 1,681 precincts and what the field above them looks like in each meeting place. No candidate\u2019s support will be consistent across the state.\nIowa used to punch the tickets of three candidates to proceed. This year, winners and losers in Iowa will be judged more by how they meet expectations than by vote percentage. The most likely outcome is that Ms. Warren and Messrs. Biden, Sanders and Buttigieg split Iowa\u2019s 41 delegates roughly equally, with Ms. Klobuchar perhaps grabbing a couple.\nThe Democratic presidential race is as up for grabs at this point as any in modern U.S. electoral history.

I think this feeds into the - somewhat justified - perception by Sanders' supporters that he can't get a fair shake from the press or the Democratic Party. So I think the whole controversy subtracts Warren voters and adds them to Sanders' total. I have never believed that Joe Biden has any enthusiastic constituency in the Democratic Party this year. I think he is essentially a placeholder until someone more suitable than Sanders can be agreed upon by the DNC. I suppose one way to put it is to say that there are no fanatical Biden supporters.

While Bernie Sanders has a lead over Biden in the Seltzer Poll (20% to 15%) , the poll has an interesting question that adds some context to the support.  They ask caucusgoers who have a first choice candidate \"Which of the following best describes your first-choice candidate: 'Is the one I like best and has the best chance to defeat President Trump' and 'Is not the one I like best, but has the best chance to defeat President Trump'  In both cases, Joe Biden leads the group.

Most of the high points mention Sanders and Warren, and one particularly interesting for Iowa was Sanders indicating he would vote against a new NAFTA that has been endorsed by the AFL-CIO and could provide some relief to farmers in Iowa according to a time article.  Sanders emphasized corporate responsibility in trade and environmental impact which may resonate in Iowa and mitigate the impact of his vote.   Though Pete Buttigieg has polled well in the past, he appears caught in the middle.

Hence I expect Elizabeth Warren's vote share to fall and the other three to rise, as her supporters decide she won't win and thus vote for someone else. This is further backed up by her funding falling recently, indicating that her campaign is stalling. The question is then who her supporters will vote for, and Bernie Sanders is the most similar to her politically, especially on big topics such as the environment, education etc (ie the kind of issues which single issue voters will base their vote on). The big question therefore is whether Buttigieg or Biden can pull away, turning this vote into a two horse race, in which case I would expect that horse to beat Sanders. So far, as at star of Jan, this doesn't appear to be happening.  Further, based on the same logic, I expect Amy Klobicher's supporters to split between Biden and Buttigeig, thus helping neither.

Small-amount are an excellent surrogate for voter support. Sanders' supporters are reputed to be extremely dedicated, and it's possible the perceived \"fix\" that gave Hillary Clinton the nomination will motivate Sanders supporters even more. Buttigieg has had some rather large rallies in Iowa lately, but that has to translate into people being willing to stand around in a high school gym for hours arguing his case. I don't think it will. It isn't difficult for a campaign to fill a hall with supporters; it doesn't mean that the support is not genuine, but if a campaign buses in people from half the precincts in the state, the rally doesn't mean much. I have no idea if that's what Buttigieg has been doing, but I'm skeptical of rally attendance being an indicator of caucus support. And Buttigeig has very few small-amount donors.  Biden's campaign has publicly said that he \"doesn't have to win\" Iowa, which is pretty much an admission that he expects to lose. Still, he's the only opponent of Sanders whose chances are above zero right now. Warren has unimpressive poll numbers in Iowa, and not much small-donor support, which is probably more important than polls in that state.
