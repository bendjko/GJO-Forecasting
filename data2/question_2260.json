The polling is clear and the level of distrust in the PM is well documented [ https://twitter.com/Samfr/status/1532758166269739009?s=20&t=sRTpXBgFy8MQnQ8eQXyjiw ]. Keep in mind that in order to lose the next election in a landslide there doesn't actually have to be that much movement in vote share nationally. Tory MPs know this. Those in now marginal seats and 'safe' seats at risk from new marginality know this. From a game theory perspective, particularly with no obvious successor, it makes sense to support the PM publicly regardless of how you will vote in the subsequent secret ballot. The only reasons to vote 'yes' to confidence now as far as I can see are: - Genuine belief that the PM can turn the trustworthiness numbers around before 2024, against an increasingly likely backdrop of falling living standards - Belief that you won't get a ministerial position, or only a less senior one, under a new leader There are certainly going to be a few MPs in both those camps, and there are as many as 170 on the government payroll [ https://twitter.com/BethRigby/status/1533719527552430080?s=20&t=TEONTiXRL-tXGSWnr6vTFw ]. I think, however, that many junior ministers will not see much risk in voting 'no' regardless of their public position. They won't be rewarded for voting 'yes' as it's a secret ballot, and this is the perfect opportunity for them to: A) Keep their job if confidence is retained B) Get rid of a leader they think will lead them to defeat (and potentially lose their own seat/job!) without actually having to take any personal or professional risks"], [1333, "2022-06-06T09:04:03Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [1639, "2022-06-06T08:56:51Z", [0.5, 0.5, 0.0], "Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee, said in a statement Monday that the number of Conservative Party parliamentarians calling for the vote had reached the necessary threshold.

There's a chance that a few letters may tip the balance over the requisite number after the above three moments in time.
