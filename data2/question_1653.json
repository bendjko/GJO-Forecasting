If students are potentially infected around 9/8 and spread to family members, symptoms may not be realized until the last week of September with rates potentially rising at that point but not peaking until well past 10/1. Hospitalizations remain low in NYC and were last over 1,000 on 4/14. Distancing policies and PPE have helped, when used, to keep transmission rates low.  https://projects.thecity.nyc/2020_03_covid-19-tracker/\nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page"], [75863, "2020-08-20T23:39:04Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [73050, "2020-08-20T20:55:14Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.03, 0.97], ""], [1333, "2020-08-20T15:35:53Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [84880, "2020-08-20T15:08:30Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [75863, "2020-08-19T23:47:25Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [31275, "2020-08-19T20:34:42Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [691, "2020-08-19T18:13:52Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [90167, "2020-08-19T14:38:44Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [1333, "2020-08-19T12:55:56Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.13, 0.87], ""], [20044, "2020-08-18T18:27:03Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.98], ""], [1333, "2020-08-18T14:50:05Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.14, 0.86], ""], [86785, "2020-08-18T14:34:34Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.03, 0.97], ""], [20156, "2020-08-18T13:02:06Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [91142, "2020-08-18T00:18:14Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [89038, "2020-08-17T20:22:21Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [86785, "2020-08-17T18:56:27Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.98], ""], [86342, "2020-08-17T11:43:59Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [1333, "2020-08-17T11:38:43Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.15, 0.85], ""], [86554, "2020-08-17T10:25:03Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [75863, "2020-08-16T21:19:40Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [79461, "2020-08-16T20:22:55Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [91924, "2020-08-16T14:15:02Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [45594, "2020-08-16T07:44:27Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.9], ""], [95065, "2020-08-16T03:14:02Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "Some immunity / social distancing still in place from big scare early on"], [57778, "2020-08-16T02:26:05Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [87897, "2020-08-15T21:27:59Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [88452, "2020-08-15T04:48:04Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.04, 0.96], ""], [87827, "2020-08-15T02:39:47Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95], "Updating due to passed time and likelihood that they have decent herd immunity."], [93358, "2020-08-14T19:15:41Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [93310, "2020-08-14T16:04:16Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [691, "2020-08-14T15:48:18Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [23236, "2020-08-14T10:49:21Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [28153, "2020-08-14T09:37:28Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [95033, "2020-08-14T03:02:17Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [93358, "2020-08-14T01:20:40Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [31275, "2020-08-14T00:47:57Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.98], ""], [90709, "2020-08-14T00:45:22Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [83, "2020-08-13T22:05:49Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [75863, "2020-08-13T21:58:43Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [19127, "2020-08-13T13:22:54Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.06, 0.93], ""], [87880, "2020-08-13T10:18:25Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [84880, "2020-08-12T22:52:12Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [93358, "2020-08-12T19:52:01Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "Right now they are in the 20's"], [40584, "2020-08-12T17:24:00Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [20044, "2020-08-12T15:21:12Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.03, 0.97], ""], [75863, "2020-08-11T21:54:22Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [1646, "2020-08-11T21:15:37Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.98], ""], [91142, "2020-08-11T00:18:30Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.98], ""], [57778, "2020-08-10T22:42:34Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [75863, "2020-08-10T21:34:40Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [19127, "2020-08-10T20:09:53Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.07, 0.91], ""], [12726, "2020-08-08T19:01:31Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.98], ""], [57778, "2020-08-08T02:24:06Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [90934, "2020-08-08T00:51:01Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "This will be the start of the flu season which will complicate and exacerbate the next wave of the coronavirus.

[2, 3] While this will not stop the disease, it should slow the spread. \nI do believe the spread of the corona virus will be slower during summer as other viruses usually work. There is also some preliminary research pointing to this.[4]  \nThe protests right now might spread the disease faster, but as the protesters are mostly young they won't usually need hospitalization, so it depends to what extent the protesters meet with elderly.   I predict the spread will be slow during summer but will speed up in autumn. If the number of hospitalizations reaches more than 1000 a day it won't happen before October when I think the weather is more favorable to the spread of the virus. 1. https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page\n2. https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/nyregion/coronavirus-antibodies-test-ny.html\n3. https://www.amny.com/coronavirus/latest-antibody-study-report-shows-up-to-20-of-nyc-residents-had-covid-19/\n4. https://www.health.com/condition/infectious-diseases/coronavirus/does-sunlight-really-kill-covid-19-heres-what-doctors-say"], [90407, "2020-06-13T15:16:57Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "The summer months will see a lot less transmission as people meet more outside.

Plus in addition the these 20%, the virus probably already attempted to infect 5-10% of population but was repelled by their inmate immune system and pre-existing cross-immunity. Summer months will only improve these defense mechanisms temporarily. So in total we might be speaking about 30%+ of population being excluded from any further virus spread. Or ~40%+ of population to exclude if we speak about the effective base (taking into account easiness to reach and to infect those people who can fuel new infections & hospitalization). But 30-40% exclusion is a noticeable blow into how quickly the virus can spread. If the mobility of people would remain as low as it was in April-May then I would predict that 1000 of hospitalizations would be reached not earlier than Mid-December or more likely - NEVER.  But a plan for re-opening economy and growth of mobility has unknown yet schedule, pushing this date much earlier.

So we cant rely on the daily positive counts to get any data (it is purely a function of the no of tests done). And a LARGE number of cases are asymptomatic.  Considering that the virus would have been in NYC since Nov 19, we could assume that the current antibody carrying rate of NYC residents might be in the 25% range (this is aggressive and the shutdown would have decreased the spread).  The spread of the virus in a community with 0% - 5% antibody carriers would be very different from a community with 20% - 25% antibody carriers.
