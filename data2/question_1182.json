Although there have been targeted killings of civilians on all sides and the government has given free reign for soldiers to commit atrocities (https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/09/south-sudan-government-troops-and-militias-given-free-rein-to-commit-new-atrocities/), there have not been large-scale systematic killings.

See here for more info: https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/841007 (also see that comment for ambiguity regarding \"mass killing campaign\") Other judgments:\n- EWP itself estimate 18.3% [1]\n- Crowd forecast here is 0%. Inside view:\n- According to EWP, \"South Sudan currently has ongoing state-led and non-state-led mass killings, with the state-led episode perpetrated against Neuer civilians, and the non-state-led episode perpetrated by followers of rebel leader Riek Machar against Dinka civilians.\" [1] These seem to capture the fault lines of the ongoing civil . war. Usually, I would have said that there aren't many ways for this to get worse, but taking a brief look at Wikipedia disabused me of that notion. [2] [3] There are possibilities for some inter- or intra-ethnic conflicts to get worse, in addition to the civil war. However, my best guess is that that is still exceedingly unlikely given the civil war. Most other conflicts did not exceed 100 casualties from what I can tell, and where likely entangled in the civil war in one way or another. Overall judgment:\n- The EWP judgment seems to be off due to the fact the ongoing mass killings seem to capture most of the violence, and it's hard to see how South Sudan could get worse. It's still somewhat plausible so 0% also seems off. My best guess is 2%.
