He seems to have people in power and public perception behind him. Promising opposition is disqualified and in Exile. Yet, he did not hinder constitutional change and officially designated a successor. Seems to me that he would be interested in stability first and strengthening of democracy second. If an option promising no civil unrest would present itself, i.e. a widely supported candidate to replace his designated successor, I think he would go for it.
