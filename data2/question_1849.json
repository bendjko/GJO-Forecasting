According to Reuters on 23rd Feb, \"AstraZeneca Plc expects its COVID-19 vaccine could receive U.S. Emergency Use Authorization at the beginning of April\" (1). Could find very little additional discussion on this in last 2 weeks. Considering that US already has 3 vaccines, they are not incentivised to rush this process. There have also been some apparently mixed results with AstraZeneca vaccine that will cause them to be cautious (eg. South Africa suspending use in Feb because \"Preliminary data from a small study show that the AstraZeneca vaccine offers minimal protection against mild to moderate disease caused by the B.1.351 variant.\" (2) ).

The AstaZeneca vaccine has received approval from several other countries and is being widely administered in Europe, Mexico, India, Argentina, and several other countries.  However, AstraZeneca has faced problems with its data related to the efficaciousness in the elderly population and their mistakes in dosing their trials.  As a result, AstraZeneca will likely have to wait to conclude US phase 3 trials which will take a few more weeks.  Novovax's vaccine results from Britain look excellent.  Novovax will likely seek British approval in the next few weeks based on these trials conducted there.  Then, Novovax is expected to apply for US approval in the 2nd quarter of 2021 based on the British trial data (if FDA will accept it), or it will wait on US phase 3 trials to complete, which could take 2-3 more months.  It is unlikely that AstraZeneca or Novovax will receive EUA approval before 3/31/21 as that would require filing an EUA application no later than March 13, 2021, based on recent precedent.  With that said, as variants continue to spread and the decline in positive cases and hospitalizations stalls in the U.S., it is possible that a 4th vaccine could receive an EUA in the next 29 days.

They may have favored to approve the J&J shot because of its single-dose appeal. Now that US has enough for entire population and a single-dose vaccine in its repertoire, there may be lessened need for more. This forecast accounts for my own ignorance and the uncertainty.

The only change that could bring approval forward might be the willingness of the FDA to allow EUA based in the results of European trials which are complete and vetted.  Astra Zeneca which is also a possibility for the US looks highly unlikely given problems with the vaccine and its lower efficacy especially given further decreased efficacy against new variants.

It looks like Novavax only started Phase III trials in the US recently (https://www.biopharma-reporter.com/Article/2021/01/04/AstraZeneca-Pfizer-Novavax-The-latest-developments-in-COVID-19-vaccines), so the clock is definitely ticking for them. Not sure they'll get in under the 31 March wire. Based on all of this, I'm even more confident we'll have 3, and even less confident we'll have 4. Janssen's not a guarantee, but things continue to look good. Astrazeneca looks very unlikely and Novavax might still pull it out, but it's less rosy than it was a month ago."], [79508, "2021-01-06T12:02:32Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.3, 0.7], ""], [97375, "2021-01-06T10:52:45Z", [0.01, 0.1, 0.59, 0.2, 0.1], ""], [97722, "2021-01-06T09:07:12Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.06, 0.54, 0.4], "Little bit of uncertainty regarding AstraZeneca being approved in the United States, given that it has a different foundation (chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine) compared to Pfizer and Moderna; and no adenovirus-vectored vaccine has no precedent in the US of being approved.

That possibility seems very remote now, so I update Moderna and Pfizer to 99% each. AstraZeneca has hit yet another snag, with Slaoui declaring it won't get an EUA before early Apr 2021 [2]. I have no idea what changed from the previous estimate of Feb 2021, no articles seem to explain. All the points that Slaoui is quoted as bringing up, were already known as of the previous estimate. In any case, early Apr 2021 is just on the boundary for this question, and Slaoui's estimate for this timeline is \"if everything goes well\", which suggests a 30%-40% estimate. Still, this is such a mind-boggling stupid decision by the FDA that I foresee some counter-pressure and possible reversal, so I'll keep it at 50%. J&J seems to be on track, and reduced its phase 3 trial from 60k to 40k participants (due to favorable reasons) [3]. Also their vaccine is only one shot, which speeds up the trials. Slaoui estimates J&J will have enough data to ask for an EUA in late Jan 2021 [3]. No real deviations here, so keep at 80%. The UK has been very quick and forward-thinking in their approvals, and they haven't even mentioned considering, let alone approving, any of the Chinese or Russian vaccines. So I'll downgrade Gameleya to 1% and the Chinese vaccines collectively to 1%. Medicago is still in phase 2 as I write this [4]. Downgrade to 0%. Bharat is moving forward in India but there is no sign that it will even seek an EUA from the FDA. This makes sense as its development was financed by the Indian govt, so they will want to keep all the doses for India. Downgrading to 1%. Novavax estimates it will have completed data collection for its phase 3 trial on 31 Mar 2021 [5]. Still 0%. Murdoch is actually trying an old vaccine (BCG) for the new purpose of fighting covid. I gave them 0% because I assumed they wouldn't need an FDA approval to go forward. But it turns out that you do need an FDA approval to use an old drug for a new purpose. I can't find any recent data about how this is going, but all the trials I've seen are too small for FDA standards (under 10k people). So give this 1%. Assuming all of these are independent, I get the following probabilities: 0: 0%\n1: 0.2%\n2: 10.4%\n3: 48.3%\n4: 39.6%\n5: 1.5%\n6+: 0% [1] https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1198736\n[2] https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/532163-astrazeneca-vaccine-likely-wont-be-authorized-in-us-until-april\n[3] https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/14/more-vaccine-developers-fda-approval-445194\n[4] https://www.medicago.com/en/covid-19-programs/\n[5] https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04611802"], [97468, "2021-01-02T15:19:38Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.06, 0.16, 0.78], ""], [78587, "2021-01-02T14:12:52Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.85, 0.15], ""], [94502, "2021-01-02T13:42:10Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.85, 0.1], "Number of approved vaccines remaining at two (PFE-BNTX, Moderna) as at 31 March are low but not impossible.

But it's looking more possible that Novavax and Astrazeneca approval comes after March 31.

It will probably be another \u201cinternational study, but this one could be faster because we know the efficacy is high so we need a smaller number of patients.\u201d Clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration may take longer because the regulator is unlikely to approve the vaccine on the basis of studies conducted elsewhere, especially given the questions over the results, Soriot said.\" [6]\nAs of Dec 8: \"Today, though, AstraZeneca hasn\u2019t even finished enrolling people in its U.S. clinical trial. A key reason: The trial was grounded for nearly seven weeks because the company was slow to provide the F.D.A. with evidence that the vaccine was not associated with neurological symptoms that had appeared in two clinical-trial participants, according to the people with knowledge of the discussions. Regulators in Britain, India and several other countries, armed with data from clinical trials outside the United States, are expected to authorize the vaccine\u2019s use in the coming weeks. But in the United States, where regulators have been frustrated with AstraZeneca and want to examine data from a greater number of participants, that approval appears further off.\" [7] \nIf finished enrolling US clinical trial in December (unsure), and FDA requires 2 months of monitoring of participants, that puts trial completion in February, and then approval sometime in March.

Even Dr. Anthony Fauci uttered his concerns about the safety of Russian and Chinese vaccines as late as August 2020.\nI find it hard to imagine the FDA will risk the approval of a vaccine that will later prove unsafe and by that risk the acceptance of vaccination among the population and compromise the vaccination and immunization effort, while there is a \"vaccination hesitancy\" and large criticism at alleged \"forced vaccination\" already. The FDA will accept those candidates for approval, as far as it is obliged to do so for the competition's sake, but it will not handle these with priority. If they receive approval at all, it may not happen before 31 March 2021.\n/The development of vaccines increasingly turns into a means of power and economic advantage, and with alleged espionage, there is also a new formation of blocks of nations in the making. The FDA will not want to promote another nation's development effort (e.g. China) and thus create new dependencies or to meddle into the political discourse, economic leverages etc. Therefore, I expect the FDA will concentrate and draw on all force to get the \"Western vaccine candidates\" through the process successfully, unless there are pertinent arguments with respect to benefits for public health. Of the six current Western csP3 candidates,\n/I withdraw one (Novavax) for possible weaknesses with regards to expected low efficacy. However, Novavax not only received a donation by the B&M Gates foundation, but also Government funding of 1.6bn USD through the \"Operation Warp Speed\" budget, so financing the research should not be an issue. As the \"BioNTech/Fosun Pharma/Pfizer\" is not part of the program, there may be some political incentive to push through the Novavax candidate in order to prove, that the Operation Warp Speed and thus the tax payer dollars had at least some effect.\n/I expect one failure\nwhich leaves four serious candidates.\nDue to the long process of csP3 trials AND approval to ensure safety and efficacy, there is still a significant risk, that one of the remaining four candidates will not reach approval in time for this question, all the more any additional approval appears to be less urgent, in case at least two of the vaccines will be proven safe and effective,  approved by the FDA and widely available fairly soon. I thus overweight \"three\", and assign 40% probability to \"4\" vaccines at maximum. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_track_(FDA)\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novavax#History"], [22690, "2020-12-09T09:45:48Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.17, 0.8], "Pfizer-Biotech, Moderna and AstraZeneca would seem pretty certain to be authorised and that still leaves J&J and Novavax (as well as Medicago from Canada that has a smaller chance too).

After I'd done a bunch of elimination I noticed that [2] is a visually much better source. From Pfizer and Moderna we see that it takes 3-4 months to conduct a phase 3 trial, and another ~3 weeks to get it reviewed by the FDA. So I discard any vaccines that haven't started a phase 3 trial yet. There are 14 that have: Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Janssen, CanSino, Gamaleya, Novavax, Medicago, Anhui, Sinopharm (2 vax), Sinovac, Bharat, Murdoch. One thing I noticed is missing from forecasts so far is the chance that the FDA will *revoke* the EUA from some vaccine due to side effects or whatever. The FDA does revoke EUAs sometimes. BASE RATES\nI was unable to find these. We want to know what % of requested EUAs are granted historically, but the FDA website only has data on the EUAs that were granted, and none on the ones that were rejected. I wrote them an email several days ago asking for this data but never heard back. So we will have to do without them. SPECIFIC VACCINES\nPfizer & Moderna: both have finished phase 3 and have EUA reviews scheduled. Pfizer on 10 Dec 2020 and Moderna on 17 Dec 2020. Today the Pfizer vaccine was approved for use in the UK, which greatly increases the chances it will be approved in the US. Not just for its technical merits, but because for once there would be political fallout for the FDA from being too risk-averse. So let's say Pfizer & Moderna will definitely be accepted in December, but a 5% chance for each to have its EUA revoked before April 2021. (In part due to the tight timeframe.) So 95% chance each. AstraZeneca: they bungled phase 3 trials somehow and are starting a new one. In late Nov 2020 they appear to still be recruiting volunteers in the US for that. If they were the only game in town I think the FDA could give them an EUA without the new trial, but now I don't think so. So they need to have the new trial finished in late Feb 2021 so they're able to be approved in Mar 2021. Let's say a 30% chance for them. Janssen: they use a technology that is already approved and in use for other vaccines. This raises their chances. They started their phase 3 trial on 7 Sep 2020 [3] and they started counting infections on 22 Sep 2020. I think this gives them plenty of time to do everything, and it comes down to whether the vaccine works. I don't understand vaccines but there've not been reports of adverse effects for them so far, so I put their chances at 80%. I don't subtract 5% for chance of EUA revocation because it's an accepted vaccine platform. Novavax: has not started phase 3 actually [4]. 0% chance for them. Anhui, CanSino, Sinopharm (2 vax), Sinovac: Low odds here I think. Either they won't request FDA approval (they'll be sold to other countries), or the FDA won't grant it, or the FDA will drag its feet and review it last. I don't think the US will \"admit defeat\" and take a Chinese vaccine, even if it would make sense to do so, or at least, it won't do it so quickly. Since these are highly correlated events I consider these one vaccine with 15% chance of approval. Gamaleya: this one is Russian, so same treatment as the Chinese vaccines. Except, it's not as clear that this one works or is harmless. Also there's only one. So call it 5%. Medicago: combined phase 2/3 trials started on 19 Nov [5]. I'm not 100% sure what that means but if they had started phase 3 in Dec 2020 I would have given them 0%. So let's say 10% here. Bharat: phase 3 trial started on 25 Nov 2020 [6]. They are doing the trial in India so I think they will get to 130 infections quicker. (What is their testing capacity?) But again I'm not even sure if they are aiming to get FDA approval. Let's give them 10%. Murdoch: this one is actually weird. They started their phase 3 trial in March 2020 [7]. How can this be?? Well, they didn't actually develop a covid vaccine. Their trial is to see if the BCG vaccine (against tuberculosis) helps. This one is presumably already authorized by the FDA. If it turns out to help against covid, does it count? I'm gonna say no. So 0% here. PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER\nTo recap, we have 10 separate events, whose probabilities I have judged thus: 95%, 95%, 30%, 80%, 0%, 15%, 5%, 10%, 10%, 0%. For simplicity I assume these are independent. Then a little python code calculates these odds: Zero vaccines: 0%\nOne vaccine: 1%\nTwo vaccines: 13%\nThree vaccines: 44%\nFour or more: 42% Throughout this exercise I've assumed that the FDA has time to evaluate however many vaccines. This isn't realistic, but I think they have time for up to five, since Moderna and Pfizer will be done already in Dec 2020. And my model only puts <1.5% chance on 6+, so I'm not gonna worry about it.

I believe its unlikely the U.S. would approve a vaccine stemming from Moscow without adequate phase three testing.  While the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) is working with more than 18 biopharmaceutical companies to rapidly develop and test COVID-19 vaccines, the FDA is not willing to rush a vaccine without understanding its side effects and overall effectiveness. Timelines as full clinical trials make it hard for vaccines to be approved by the FDA, then that timeline can be compounded by manufacturing and delivery on a massive scale needed to make a vaccine available to the public. Granted the question is specific to emergency use, so that may increase the chances of its use. The FDA commissioner, Stephen M. Hahn, M.D., recently said \"We are committed to expediting the development of COVID-19 vaccines, but not at the expense of sound science and decision making. We will not jeopardize the public\u2019s trust in our science-based, independent review of these or any vaccines.
