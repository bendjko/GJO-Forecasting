While Orange with its 1.939mn inhabitants (est. as of 2019) represents about 9.03% of all FL inhabitants (21.478mn est. as of 2019), testing statistics suggests that in the mid-east region of the FL peninsular counties have been under-tested. As of 09 July 2020, of all 2.424mn \"Total People Tested\" only 6.89% or 167,133 of the total have undergeone a test in Orange. The \"Awaiting testing\" number of 195, or 1.2%, appears to be low to me, but I'd like to find out what it means exactly, and whether these cases usually have a higher positivity than average, whether they are supposed to become \"inconclusive\" in the end (no tests of this category so far in Orange), or whether their results just came in late to be included into daily reports. As of 10 July this figure increased to 230, but I still tend to interpret, that testing in Orange runs in a rather orderly procedure, compared to other FL counties (Miami) or states.\nThe under-testing in Orange may be a point of uncertainty for future cases increases, but currently it does not seem worrisome as the reason may lie, as I mentioned before, in worse-than-average outbreaks in metro areas of Jacksonville, Tampa and especially Miami with the respective counties surrounding them.\nIn contrast, Orange has a below-average positivity rate of 9.8% as of 10 July 2020 (9.66% as of 09 July), so the health admin may not see the necessity to test there and will route available supplies and lab capacities to the red-flagged areas. This is reasonable, but risky at the same time since an outbreak will not indicate its start beforehand, and if you start to increase testing late, as with Texas, it may be too late. However, Orange county is situated in the middle of and with borders to Semilnole (4,083 cases; 8.8% total positivity rate), Brevard (3,237; 5.5%), Osceola (3,861; 11.3%), Lake (2,394; 5.7%); Polk is close and rather heavily infected (6,983; 11.4%), but does not have a common border with Orange, it seems, so my conclusion here is that a worsening of the outbreak in Orange from transporting the virus into Orange from neighboring counties is slim, it is more likely that the virus will migrate from greater Orlando area out into less infected areas and counties.\nFurthermore, looking at the \"Cases by Zip Code\" tab you can see that the virus occurrence is not yet evenly spread, and that e.g. within Polk the most affected area is the Zips in the Winter Haven-area, while to the northeast, towards Orange and Orlando, there are still some Zips, which are hardly or less densely affected. Inland, inter-county traffic, which may be reduced, may be one reason, while coastal areas such as around Tampa, Jacksonville, and West Palm Beach down to Miami are highly affected maybe due to holiday season, spring break aftermath, snowbirds or other inter-state traffic. In all, if figures will remain low (cases below 700 per day ; positivity rate below 10%) for at least five more days, I will be confident that Orange has avoided the worst, and the outcome of this question will be below 30,000. However, if positivity rate spikes even in Orange, which the recent increase heralds and which spells trouble, it's time to stay alert."], [87064, "2020-07-12T10:26:42Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.15, 0.8, 0.05], ""], [89013, "2020-07-12T05:26:57Z", [0.0, 0.25, 0.7, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [89013, "2020-07-12T05:25:57Z", [0.0, 0.6, 0.35, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [88198, "2020-07-12T05:22:34Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5], ""], [93181, "2020-07-12T02:31:37Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.8, 0.15], "Thanks to @Se_meyer for explaining to me that we are looking for the total cases.
