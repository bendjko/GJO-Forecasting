But that's a bit stupid, seeing as how a date has already been set! (https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/10/19/lebanon-sets-march-date-parliamentary-election). Let's go back to the last election, in 2018. That was postponed a ton of times, but importantly the initial postponement was set to be for at least two years. They did it right up against the deadline, under a month before the scheduled time. Also importantly, the ongoing Syrian civil war was a factor - that seems to be somewhat less of an issue this time. Here's another way of looking at it- of the last nine *scheduled* elections, three were postponed, so really the base rate for non-postponement is about 70%. Honestly, it feels a bit higher- let's say 75%. If it is delayed, I'm betting it's more likely to be delayed past June, but I'm not totally sure. Splitting the difference. Last time around, the parliament announced May elections in mid-December, and stuck to the plan.

Although originally scheduled for 2013, the election was postponed three times in 2013, 2014 and 2017 under various pretexts, including the security situation, the failure of the Parliament to elect a new President, and the technical requirements of holding an election.

The worsening economic situation is driving the push for a more rapid election.  Parliament voted on an earlier date which pushes the election into the first bucket.
