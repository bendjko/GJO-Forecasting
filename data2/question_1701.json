Two key numbers: \nParson only took 75% of the Republican Vote, or 510,000 votes out of 680,000\nGalloway took 84.6% of the Democrat Vote, or 453,000 votes out of 535,000.  That leaves 80,000 Democrats who likely will follow Galloway, and 170,000 Republicans who voted against Parson in the Primary. The key question is whether they are angry enough to switch parties.   Parson (and the Republican party) was firmly against Medicaid Expansion, which is why the voters went around them and put it on the ballot. It passed 672,000 - 590,000. So, 90,000 voters crossed party lines on this issue.  Another key result is that among the Republicans who didn\u2019t vote for Parson, 12% or 83,000 voted for McDowell, also a female, and the most left of the Republicans. This is comparable to the 90,000 who crossed the party line on Medicare.  Assuming the remaining voters stay solid with Parson, this puts Galloway back where she was at the beginning of this question, according to FiveThirtyEight, in a statistical dead heat. Missouri is one of the latest hot spots for Corona Virus, and Parson refuses to wear a mask, much less require one. He has insisted children return to school, and will likely be blamed for outbreaks.  I want to see some post primary polls, but  have increased my Galloway (Democrat) likelihood slightly. In Pettis County, where I live, a Republican stronghold, the relationship bears out. Parson took 5,030 of 5,842 Republican votes vs 5,437 who voted no on Medicare.
