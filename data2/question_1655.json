The prosecution must also serve a substantial federal interest, and the prosecutor must assess whether, in his/her judgment, the person is subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction; and whether there exists an adequate non-criminal alternative to prosecution. It is left to the judgment of the attorney for the government to determine whether these circumstances exist.

In assessing the seriousness of the offense in these terms, the prosecutor may properly weigh such questions as whether the violation is technical or relatively inconsequential in nature and what the public attitude may be toward prosecution under the circumstances of the case. \nDeterrent Effect of Prosecution. Deterrence of criminal conduct, whether it be criminal activity generally or a specific type of criminal conduct, is one of the primary goals of the criminal law. This purpose should be kept in mind, particularly when deciding whether a prosecution is warranted for an offense that appears to be relatively minor; some offenses, although seemingly not of great importance by themselves, if commonly committed would have a substantial cumulative impact on the community.\u201c\nSo far not able to determine base rate as not sure where to get statistics on it. \nGoing to dial back some as it appears it could go either way but noting the Feds did start into an investigation. \n"], [58293, "2020-06-16T14:18:28Z", [0.6], "Charges filed would most likely not be federal"], [87064, "2020-06-16T12:41:09Z", [0.65], ""], [41353, "2020-06-16T12:16:36Z", [1.0], ""], [73970, "2020-06-16T07:16:04Z", [0.72], ""], [89304, "2020-06-16T06:27:52Z", [1.0], ""], [63963, "2020-06-16T02:43:19Z", [0.0], ""], [89236, "2020-06-16T02:17:36Z", [0.25], "There are a number of reference cases, including but certainly not limited to the murders of Eric Garner, Anthony Baez, and Rodney King.
