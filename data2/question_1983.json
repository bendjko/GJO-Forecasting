Trying to be as objective as possible (as a Maple Leafs fan), the Canadiens will be huge underdogs in the finals. Since the start of the 2000s decade of hockey, the Lightning have won 2 Stanley Cups (and are reigning champions), while the Canadiens haven't won since 1993. Out of the 52 games they've played since the start of the 2010/2011 season, Tampa Bay has won 29. If we condense that time frame to since the start of the 2014/2015 season, Tampa Bay has won 21/31. If we use 21/31 as the probability that Tampa Bay wins an independent game, there's about an 84.3% base probability that they take the whole thing. I think this base probability mostly encompasses the fact that Tampa Bay has the objectively stronger and deeper team. The way the Canadiens could win, however, is continuing to leverage their special teams, which have been especially lethal in the playoffs (27/30 penalty kill in the playoffs, 3 shorthanded goals scored, 6 powerplay goals scored). On the other hand, Tampa Bay has a strong powerplay and they went 8/20 in their first round matchup against the Panthers. It'll really be interesting to see how these two match up on special teams, and I think it'll be the main driver the Canadiens need to take this series.

Long story short, subtracting a set % from each implied probability is the way to go, don't normalize them. The way betting site odds are designed is that the implied probabilities of the odds are higher than the actual probabilities they estimate, with the markup over the actual probability called the vigorish or vig. That's why if you calculate the implied probability from the sportsbook averages they'll sum to more than 100%, in the case of the source I'm using 151% currently (https://www.sportsbettingdime.com/nhl/stanley-cup-odds/). For example if an actual probability is 25%, they set the odds at 30%, since 30% pays less than 25%, so its usually profitable to have probabilities sum to >100%. The way people here seem to be getting a ~40% chance for \"another team or no team\" seems to be based on normalizing the averages, or reducing them all by the same percentage (doing that to the aforementioned numbers gives 42% chance of other/none), but at least from what I've read that doesn't reflect how vig is actually determined. Normalization reduces all probabilities by the same proportion, but bookmakers will usually include a proportionally much higher vig on the smaller probabilities (i.e. saying a 1% chance is actually 2%, or a 100% markup), and a smaller one on the favorites (20% as maybe 22%, for a 10% markup). So normalizing incorrectly penalizes favorites and rewards underdogs relative to what the bookmakers actually do.  Saying there's a 40% chance of a team winning who isn't one of the top 5 favorites (out of only 16 teams) is a fairly spicy take, moreso than the normalized approach to sportsbook odds would imply. Looking at odds from before Round 1 for Stanley Cups since 1990, only 27% of eventual winners ranked below 5th, and 27% of winners had odds of >+1000. So normalization is at odds with accounts of how bookmakers operate, and to an extent at odds with the history of how those odds perform in practice.  The options for getting rid of vig are generally normalization (not optimal as explained), equal distribution which is where you subtract a set percentage from each probability, or a power based approach outlined here (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305687456_ADJUSTING_TRUE_ODDS_TO_ALLOW_FOR_VIGORISH). The power approach doesn't adequately adjust the lower probabilities in my opinion, they still sum to 38%, my guess being because the vig is huge in this set of bets. 51% is a huuuuge margin (the power article mentions vig ranging from 2-20%) and that margin would be difficult to achieve using a single formula approach without making your bets on the favorites very distorted and clearly non-competitive with other sites, so the bets on underdogs are probably inflated beyond what a simple power formula would suggest. So I opt to use the equal distribution approach, and remove 3.2% from each implied probability. It's simple, but makes sense given how bookmakers operate, and gives an estimate for other/none (29%) that's consistent with how hockey odds have performed in the past.
