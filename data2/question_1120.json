Lobbying efforts seem to be quite strong in pushing back EV adoption at the moment.\n- confused incentive program where customers might be asked to return the incentives after they've purchased create uncertainty for buyers.\n- very slow adoption of EV compared to North America and rest of Europe (@100,000; only half of which seem to be fully electric; other half hybrid. This is compared to the 41 million cars on German roads as of Jan 2018)\n- seem to target Tesla legally and politically, even though Tesla sales in Germany are miniscule. This promotes the sense of uncertainty and difficulty to the consumer. \n- EV start-ups springing up to fill big auto manufacturer void will be eaten -- too small to sustain a profit in such a capital intensive industry with high barriers to entry.\nSo slow adoption in Germany compared to other non-auto manufacturing economies as evidenced by pool of incentive susibsidies used as of August 2018 sat somewhere around 100,000 million euros out of 600, 000 million offered back in 2016.    Trends\n \"Since the launch of the program in 2016, over 46 000 applications for plug-in vehicles subsidy were submitted.  Last year alone the EV sales in the country increased by  23%.\"  EVs are a transformational innovation; not a passing trend. Climate change iniatives seems to be central to economic policy. So it seems really stupid for one of world's best automaking countries to see it pass them by like this. (But stupid is everywhere these days.) Merkel's subsidy efforts might be better suited to incentivizing the manufacturers to push price of EVs and ancilliary items (like charging stations) down.  I think Chancellor Merkel's visionary leadership is coming to a close. Hard to tell if her successor will embrace EVs or bow to big auto manufacturers to secure short term political concession. There's no consumer rush to take a chunk of the 600,000 mill euros so lowering (as opposed to canning it altogether) is a political win..savings to the public purse but still says the country is committed to a move away from diesel.  Will this be extended by 2020 who knows?
