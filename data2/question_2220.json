But historically quite low, with yields falling to 2% in 2008 and staying in the ~2-4% range until 2020. As a bit of a side note, while I am a little skeptical of the predictive ability of technical analysis, it is worth noting that the 2% yield mark has served as a significant level of support/resistance from 2008 onwards. (Instinctually this also makes some sense as the FEDs stated target for inflation is 2% annually, so an annual yield of 2% nominal should be about break-even on a real basis if the FED meets it's targeted goal when averaged out over the 10 year term. Making it a very important level to consider as a bond purchaser). This should indicate that if this 2% level is able to hold in the near term, it should act as support going forward. Fundamentally, the driving cause behind the bond market being at the historically low levels it is the unprecedented emergency monetary policy action taken by the FED in response to COVID. With inflation running hot and the US(hopefully) at the end of the pandemic phase, it seems almost a given that monetary tightening is set to begin soon. I would expect a 25bp raise at the March meeting with more rate hikes likely coming as the FED begins liftoff off of the emergency lows. I would also expect them to look to start tapering assets purchases with an outside chance they may begin unwinding some of their assets off the FEDs books if they want to get more aggressive with tightening. These action over the coming months should reduce buying pressure, meaning that the path of least resistance for yield is likely higher from here. I am leaving a 10% margin of error, mainly to cover possible cases where the FED is scared off their current tightening trajectory due to concerns over the economic implications of sanctions against Russia or some sort of taper tantrum."], [99857, "2022-03-10T17:47:27Z", [0.71], ""], [1333, "2022-03-10T17:17:11Z", [0.73], ""], [94791, "2022-03-10T17:12:36Z", [0.4], "Reiteration. 1.7% backtested successfully.\nQuestion returns to whether 2.0% can be broken and held.

After coming out strong with a forecast that goes against the crowd, I\u2019ve lost a bit of confidence in my original projection. I\u2019m going to lay out my entire thought process for and against a move higher in 10-Yr rates, any comments/corrections/thoughts welcome: Reasons FOR a rate move higher 1)\tIt\u2019s what the Fed wants. If one of the primary reasons for the Fed\u2019s asset purchases was to drive long-term bond prices higher/yields lower to inject cash into a struggling pandemic economy, the reverse should occur with the winding down of the asset purchases. The Fed will only allow inflation to trend meaningfully above its ~2% target (current running 5-7%) for so long and needs to act. Within the window of this question, I expect the Fed\u2019s asset purchase program to be done and at least 1 Fed Funds rate hike in place. The direction correlation between Fed Funds rates and long-term yields is somewhat weak but the removal of Fed-backed purchases of the 10-yr could present a supply/demand mismatch driving bond prices lower/yields higher. https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2017/october/increases-fed-funds-rate-impact-other-interest-rates 2)\tWith the uptick in inflation, real bond yields have fallen into negative territory. While this country has experienced periods of high inflation and periods of low bond yields, but it has been rare to find both occurring simultaneously, resulting in sustained negative real interest rates. For those who subscribe to the theory that the older generation is flocking to long-dated Treasuries to protect retirement nest eggs, how long will this cohort stick to an asset class generating -4% real yield? https://wolfstreet.com/2021/08/18/whats-behind-this-messed-up-bond-market/ 3)\tIf the two points above are incorrect, (i.e. the Fed cannot influence long term yields and investors are fine with negative real interest rates for a sustained period of time) the long-term ramifications are bleak. These two conditions harken back to late 1990\u2019s Japan. The result was a \u201cliquidity trap\u201d which left the central bank ineffective in its efforts to stimulate the economy with monetary policy. It might seem silly to worry about this, as Japan's problem was deflation, not inflation, as we are experiencing now, but that's why they call it the dismal science. I also recognize that I might be making an error of forecasting something I \u201cwant\u201d rather than what will actually occur, but none-the-less, I don\u2019t see this as a viable outcome.  https://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/wp_862.pdf 4)\tFor the question to resolve as a \u201cYes\u201d the move in interest rates is would not be abnormally volatile. A \u201cyes\u201d resolution requires the 10-Yr yield to eclipse 2.25% at any point between now and June 2022. You only need to go back to May 2019 to find the rate north of 2.25% and as recently as November of 2018 the 10-Yr was above 3%. An 85-basis point move (which is what would be required to go from current 1.4% to 2.25%) happened between November 2020 and March 2021, so not unprecedented, even in recent history. Reasons AGAINST a rate move higher 1)\tIt goes against a 40-year trend. Interest rates have been declining in straight line since Regan was president. Calls for meaningfully higher rates have proven incorrect for nearly 4 decades. The \u201coutside case\u201d for this question favors downward pressure on yields. https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2020-12/56891-real%20-interest-rates.pdf 2)\tThe multi-decade move lower in rates has not been driven by typical default risk concerns. Despite a lot of hand wringing (e.g. NYC debt clock, perennial debt-ceiling debates & austerity hawks) the US Government\u2019s cost to finance deficits has basically declined every year. I\u2019m not going to wade into the politics or conspiracy theories here, but it\u2019s a fact. For now, the Keynesians have won. 3)\tTreasury demand is driven by institutional/sovereign investors who either do not care about yield or are happy with a -3% real yield when their home market debt is yielding even less. Contrary to popular opinion, most of the demand for treasuries is not grandpa\u2019s retirement nest egg, but rather foreign governments, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies and other institutional investors. They have been, and will continue to, purchase T-Bonds regardless of yield to safely park cash, offset liabilities or pick up yield against the Japanese 10-Yr at 0.05%, German Bund at -0.4% or UK Gilt at 0.78%.   https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/insights/negative-real-rates 4)\tOmicron/COVID. We can debate about the impact that the pandemic is having on the actual economy, but the market has been in a \u201cprice for the worst, ask questions later\u201d mode for 2 years. I\u2019m having trouble squaring mid-high single digit inflation with a soft economy (I know, I know, stagflation) But the fact is, the market is very headline skittish and the safety of US issued paper is comforting to many.   5)\tInflation fears are overblown. If I\u2019m wrong with this forecast, I\u2019m going to learn something, and it might be something about inflation. My current belief is that inflation is going to be worse than people fear and sustained for longer than people believe. I acknowledge that there is a transitory element because of pandemic-related supply chain issues. But, these issues (and whatever is driving the \u201cGreat Resignation\u201d) is pushing blue-collar wages higher. I expect these to prove very sticky and trickle \u201cup\u201d to supervisors and through the workforce. However, I also acknowledge that un-crimping the supply chain plus slower economic growth could fix the inflation issue faster than the Fed can react.\n"], [1333, "2021-12-20T18:17:57Z", [0.2], ""], [93181, "2021-12-20T16:06:41Z", [0.3], ""], [103442, "2021-12-19T19:06:32Z", [0.35], "Slowdown in China, rising COVID, plus fiscal and monetary constraint in USA suggest 2022 will have slower GDP growth, maybe even recession.

So in order for yields to return/exceed that level we'd like the US economy to return to pre-COVID levels, substantial re-rating of inflation expectations, or a material change in the supply/demand dynamic of the bond market.\n2) So let's consider how the Fed is looking at the economy / their monetary policy -- Jay Powells \"hawkish pivot\" certainly increased the likelihood of higher rates/accelerated tapering to combat inflation (https://www.ft.com/content/bbbd46e1-75b3-4882-a2c8-bde7a8df7620).\n3) So with a quicker taper (less demand for bonds from the Fed, means bond prices down, yields up).\n4) On the jobs front the picture seems mixed (https://www.reuters.com/business/us-job-openings-jump-11-million-october-2021-12-08/) but generally seems like we are trending in the right direction and could approach pre-pandemic levels by the summer\n5) Given the above picture, I think there is a likelihood that the US10Y could approach pre-pandemic levels by July 1, but pre-pandemic it appears the yields were <2% -- seemed to trade around 1.90% pretty well.\n6) There is also a debt angle at play here -- be it a global \"taper tantrum\" issue or the levels of domestic debt in the US which has risen substantially (total debt >350%) which may limit the level rates can rise given this debt trap and negative consequences of forced develeraging. Given the above, I think it \"felt right\" to start at 50/50 (tip of the nose) but having weighed the debt trap angle along with where rates were pre-pandemic (~1.90%) I can't see a strong argument for such a substantial rise above that -- so I'll cut that forecast in half and knock off a couple points. 22% is reasonable here."], [691, "2021-12-12T16:10:58Z", [0.4], ""], [86367, "2021-12-12T16:04:21Z", [0.4], ""], [101422, "2021-12-12T15:51:32Z", [0.1], ""], [29054, "2021-12-12T14:11:36Z", [0.14], "The whole risk market is supported by the fed rates, if the fed moves rates the deleverage will be fast and furious, call it a coverage panic, (levarage today is at historical highs by 150%).

Once they have settled the budget in Congress we will start seeing a lot more debt go on to the market. Also the fed and other nations are going to be buying less debt, at least supposedly. Also inflationary pressures should be working to push up interest rates. So all of these things should bring us above 2.25% especially considering it is historically unusual for bond rates to be this low. However, as inflation causes more problems for the stock market, investors will likely pull out of the stock market and go into bonds as a safety (which is ridiculous because bonds have a negative real return). And ultimately the treasury market is not a real market and hasn't been for a long time. In any rational world treasury rates would not have a negative real return for such a long time. Rates are low because the FED keeps them low artificially and they have to keep them low because the United States cannot afford to pay a market rate of interest on the debt. So I think this is really a question about what we think the FED is willing to let rates go to. A very large portion of the national debt is on short-term notes, so really the US government has the equivalent of an adjustable rate mortgage. If treasury rates go up it doesn't take very long for the debt in 3 month, 6 month, 1 year bonds that is being rolled over to go to higher interest rates and the US is quickly paying a higher amount of interest. Also keep in mind that the 10-year treasury is very crucial because it is a benchmark for many financial rates such as the mortgage rate. If the 10-year rate goes up, mortgage rates go up, and there goes your wealth effect that the FED is trying to create. If low rates create wealth then the corollary has to be true that higher rates will eliminate wealth. Not that 2.25 is that high historically, but the market is so addicted to low rates now that I think it's pretty high by today's standards.  Ultimately I'm going to give this a pretty high likelihood because of the chance of it flashing up above 2.25 for a short time."], [1333, "2021-12-10T18:34:48Z", [0.1], ""], [60695, "2021-12-10T18:28:14Z", [1.0], ""], [99993, "2021-12-10T18:18:08Z", [0.1], ""]]}
