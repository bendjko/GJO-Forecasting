Wikipedia says there's a parabolic trough component, which I don't see mentioned elsewhere; maybe it's been dropped?  At any rate, troughs are a mature technology, and if it's not massively behind schedule, I wouldn't worry too much.\nThe power tower with molten salt storage, is a combination of two fairly new technologies in terms of installed capacity.  The most similar system in the US is Crescent Dunes, which has been a total debacle, and it's not like foreign firms have that much more experience either.  (Note: Crescent Dunes took two months to melt the salt in the storage system).  There are so many components to these systems, from the heliostats, to the power block, storage tanks, tower, receiver, cooling system, as well as all the general plumbing and electrical connections, and I don't think we've heard about any of them other than the tower and receiver.

UAE as of today has a case rate of about 282 infections per 100,000 inhabitants, which lies near the lower bound for this number in nations of the Gulf region. Oman (146) and Saudi Arabia (198) lie below, Bahrain (443), Kuwait (545) and Qatar (1,473) lie well above this number, which indicates an uneven spread in the region due to individual national, social and other conditions, which may reduce or promote the community spread. Apart from differences in the intensity in testing, it may also, however, be a sign for a different timeline of the beginning of the pandemic in each state, with Qatar probably being affected at a very early stage. Thus, Qatar with its intense integration of foreign labor force in construction may be a blue print of the SARS-CoV-2 situation in the UAE in two to three weeks from now. With further increasing virus spread and more confirmed cases, foreign labor may decide to return to their home countries for safety reasons, or the afflux of new labor force may run dry for a couple of month, until the situation appears more clear, not to mention more practical difficulties in travel to and entering the UAE in the wake of travel restrictions and border control measures.
