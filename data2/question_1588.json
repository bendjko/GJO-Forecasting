The next consensus forecast is for December 2020, for which the median point estimate is 7.6% (80% CI: 6.5%, 8.5%). Given that the consensus forecast for December is slightly more optimistic than for September, we can probably expect continued improvement from the September unemployment rate (median point estimate of 8.0%) to the October unemployment rate (which this question asks about). Given this, and also given that the 90th percentile for the consensus forecast for September is 8.5%, I think we can safely rule out an October unemployment rate of 10.0% or greater \u2014 thus eliminating bins 3, 4, 5, 6. Moreover, it also seems very unlikely that the October unemployment rate will be lower than 6.0% given that the 10th percentile of the consensus forecast for December 2020 is only 6.5%. So I think we can also rule out an unemployment rate of less than 6.0% \u2014 thus eliminating bin 1. Only bin 2 is left, and the October unemployment rate is likely to be safely somewhere in the middle of the 6.0-10.0% range rather than toward one of the ends of this range.

Overall, I believe that a) the true unemployment rate is currently +20% (will see when this month's report is released) and b) that it is likely to stay up around this level, though with fluctuations, for the coming months. In the even that future waves of COVID are mild, and second-order consequences are limited, we might see mild recovery into the 14-18% band. If the future waves are more severe, possibly to the point of triggering additional lockdowns, then unemployment will remain higher, and even the risk of them will serve to dampen economic recovery and growth.

However, I suspect this decrease will be lower than expected with no 'bounce back'. This is because a large number of businesses will not have the ability to start employing again and their confidence will be low. Also, a second wave becomes more likely with the easing of restrictions. In my previous forecast, I suspected that there would be a longer lockdown in the US compared to what is happening. This means people will still be searching for work throughout the crisis, contributing to the U3 measurement continually for the next 6 months.  Next month's rate could increase to 15%-18% because there is a lag to the U3 measurement. (only included up until the 12th of last month).

Should I even try to forecast this question?  I have decided to do so.  The pandemic is a once-in-a-lifetime event.  I ought to know something about its effect on the economy. Background first:\nOne would think that unemployment rate is simply the number of unemployed divided by the number of employed people.  Not so as far as the US government statistics are concerned.  Terms like \u201cactive job seekers\u201d, \u201cseasonally adjusted numbers\u201d, \u201cdiscouraged job seekers\u201d, \u201cpart-timers\u201d, \u201cunder-employed\u201d and \u201ctemporarily unemployed\u201d float around.  U3 unemployment rate (in this forecast) specifically counts only the active job seekers.\nThis leads to an important question.  Will all of the massive increase of unemployed people due to the shutdown of the economy be counted as active job seekers, and therefore included in the U3 (even though there are few jobs available to be seeked)?  Current situation:\nThere is no way I can account for all (or even the most) of the nuances involved in coming up with the U3 rate as defined by the government.  I will do my best to estimate the unemployment rate as I see fit.\n\nTwo assumptions are used here.  First is that I count all the unemployed people due to the economic shutdown and make no determination of whether they are active job seekers or not.  Second is that I use 160M as the baseline employment number (E0) before the slowdown [1].  I will subtract the unemployment (UE) from E in calculating the unemployment rate.  That is UER = UE/(E0-UE). Lets do a consistency check first.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics [2] reports 7.1M unemployed people in March 2020.  Therefore 7.1/(160-7.1) = 4.6%.  This is similar to the 4.4% reported [2].  (If you just divide 7.1 by 160, you actually get 4.4%, but it is important to subtract out the UE in the denominator when the UE is a significant fraction of E \u2013 see next paragraph). Various reports show that the total UE is 22M on the week of 11 April [3].  Therefore the current unemployment rate is 22/(160-22) = 16%.  (If you don\u2019t subtract 22 from the denominator, it would be 14%).  Note that this rate is much higher than some of the forecast rates [4], even though the 16% does not include the expected increases in the second half of April. Looking into the future: About 95% of the US population is under some forms of lockdown. Only five states (North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Arkansas and Iowa) have no stay-at-home orders at all, but they constitute to a small percentage of the US population.  Therefore the weekly INCREASE in unemployment should be tapering off soon.  This view is consistent with the data \u2013 newly unemployed are 6.9M, 6.6M and 5.2M for the last 3 weeks (oldest first) [3].   If you take a linear trend, the total unemployed will peak at ~30M in several weeks, making the peak unemployment rate to be 30/(160-30) = 23%.  This is my starting point of the unemployment rate for the economic recovery. For the forecast question, we need to deal with 3 questions first.\n1.\tWhen will the economy start to open up?\n2.\tHow fast will the economy recover after opening up? \n3.\tHow many of the 30M unemployed will be hired again? The virus outbreak is definitely slowing down.  Realistically the US will open up its economy before covid-19 is completely \"wiped out\", if that is possible.  Some risks will be taken, and I think the government people know that.  (The decision is likened to the famous economist's example of allowable car speed limits.  If you want no car deaths, set a speed limit of 5 mph, but it reduces significantly the economic activities.  By setting it at 55 mph, you are allowing an acceptable amount of car deaths, but at the same time allowing the economy to function).   I expect the gradual opening up in the June-July time frame. While it took 3 years for the US to recover from the 2008 Great Recession, I expect it will be faster this time.  The large companies will have to deal with supply chain issues, but they will be helped by the federal government (too big to fail!).  Their recovery could be relatively fast.  The small business, which constitutes to 50% of the US economy, will have a hard time restarting.  The federal funds designated to help small businesses is dried up already [6].  Their recovery could be much slower.  Many of them could fail. To bracket my forecasts:\nIf one-third of the 30M unemployed get rehired, UE rate would be 14%.\nIf half of the 30M unemployed get rehired, UE rate would be 10%.\nIf two-third of the 30M unemployed get rehired (a very optimistic scenario), UE rate would be 7%. Unfortunately these rates lie on the boundaries of the forecast baskets, which makes it harder to put numbers in them.

Currently unemployment is 4%. I assume it's going to be ~14% higher in October, so about 18%. However I'm adding a big error bar of 8% - 25% because there are a lot of unknowns.  First, I am not working from the mindset that the economy is going to come roaring back in a V-shaped recovery. I think inertia will keep this down for a while. \n1) leisure and restaurants are going to be hit hard for a long time. That's like 10-15% of the workforce \n2) oil is going to be hurting for a long time\n3) there is a global recession so overseas demand won't fix the problem and the time lag is longer than 6 months\n4) The problems above will cause flow-through problems to the rest of the economy over a period of months Big picture: currently there are 22M more people unemployed than a month ago and losses are continuing. Let's say that job losses have peaked and in a month that number grows to \"just\" 35M. That's over 20% of all of the workers in the US and it comes on top of the 4M who were already unemployed.  Getting a significant fraction of 35M people into new jobs is going to be tough: \n1) ongoing domestic and global recession\n2) some sectors are gone (leisure) and others are up (home delivery, streaming) so most people will need substantial re-purposing I'm not sure how to factor in government aid. Currently it appears that generous unemployment will encourage people to not seek jobs. Plus there aren't nearly enough jobs available. If there are massive employment projects between now and October, then that could help. It will be easiest for people who already work in areas like construction, but that's a drop in the bucket. Infrastructure projects sound good, but can we really employ 20-40M people mostly from hospitality building dams, power lines, roads and whatever? It seems like a stretch. Maybe we'll try to hire 20M people into the military or some new part of the federal government ... but to do what?  First, I see Leisure and hospitality (10% of all jobs) to be way down in fall. Until there's a cure, who's going to go on vacation, eat in restaurants, etc? Not me. -50% of pre-COVID levels could turn out to be optimistic. Maybe -75%. Also retail (10%) will be down, say 25%.  The above will cause flow-through disruption to other areas: financial services, manufacturing, mining, professional services, wholesale that are collectively ~50% of the workforce. I assume they will be down by something like 15%.

The mean average peak of the last 10 spikes in the U3 unemployment rate (U3UR) = 7.86%. The highest = 10.8% (1982) and the lowest = 6.1% (1954/1971). Historically, there is a relationship between the size of the GDP decrease and the magnitude of the spike. However, this is not always the case e.g. 1949 post-war recession. Using past examples may be misleading for this question because the COVID-19 crisis will have a unique effect on the US economy. That being said, they cannot be dismissed as useless. Although there is a record number of unemployment insurance claims, this will not directly correlate with the U3UR in terms of timing or numbers. This is because a vast majority of those people will be classed as marginally attached and for a large proportion of this crisis may not be looking for work as there won\u2019t be any. Perhaps the U3UR will start to increase more substantially as the economy starts to roll again and more jobs are available.\nSize of the labor force in Dec 2019 = 164.6 million Already U3 unemployed in Dec 2019 = 5.761 million (3.5%) Very vulnerable jobs = 93.68 million (leisure & hospitality/education & health/professional & business services/retail/construction/transport) 30% of these jobs could be lost in the short term (very unsure about this number \u2013complete guesstimate) 30% of 93.68 million = 28.104 million Non \u2018vulnerable jobs\u2019 at risk = 2.5 million (another complete guestimate) Total = 30.604 million How many out of these will be searching for a job during the COVID-19 peak? No idea! Let\u2019s say between 5 million and 20 million (+ 5.761 already U3 unemployed) = between 10.761 million and 25.761 million (between 6.54% and 15.65% U3UR) 2. The average time lag between initial U3UR rise and the peak of last 10 spikes = 17.8 months Important to say that these were caused by recessions. There probably will be a recession on the back of this crisis and I believe there will be 2 spikes in the next 2 years. One caused by COVID-19 and a second by a recession. The rapidly increasing debt levels are very worrying for the near future. Historically, does a larger peak mean a steeper gradient? No. 3. I think there will be a substantial rise in the next 2 months. After 2 months the impact of the virus should be diminishing (estimating this from curves of other countries and the trajectory of the curves), businesses will cautiously begin to hire, giving people more incentive to start looking for jobs. I believe this will cause the first peak in around 4-5 months at around 13%. I believe it will decrease quite sharply over the next few months but in October, I estimate it will be around 10%. Criticism is very welcome, I\u2019m extremely unsure about this one!\n"], [37893, "2020-04-09T11:30:39Z", [0.0, 0.2, 0.35, 0.35, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [87105, "2020-04-09T09:25:10Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.15, 0.45, 0.2, 0.15], "This one's tough because it depends so much on the course of the virus.
