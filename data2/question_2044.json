It is useful to look at the chart directly at the IMF website, and that data will also likely be available slightly before the FRED publishes it (it is late this month). What is interesting to note is that wheat is going up nearly in lock step with all commodities tracked by the IMF in their data portal. And especially in that context, it does not seem likely to me that wheat will fall in the remainder of the forecast. Click on the link below and follow these steps:\n1. Slide the left side of the time window all the way to the left to see all time.\n2. Immediately above the graph, on the left side, click on the drop-down menu labeled \"Commodity (All commodities and Energy)\", and type in \"wheat\" and click on the search (magnifying glass) button (not the \"Go\" button). When wheat appears, click on it and then click on the \"Go\" button.\n3. The units displayed are \"Unit (Index)\". Leave it like that for a moment to compare all commodities with wheat. Change the units to \"US Dollars\" to see wheat prices only.\nhttps://data.imf.org/?sk=471DDDF8-D8A7-499A-81BA-5B332C01F8B9&sId=1547558078595 Second, again, my impression is that most people here are looking at Chicago SRW wheat: https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/ZWY00/overview\nThat would explain why the crowd is so heavy on bin 3.

It's collateral damage of the energy crisis in China. Fertilizer producers in China are struggling to meet demand, and separately, urea production has been cut. Urea is a component of most fertilizers, including types used for wheat; urea is the most important source of nitrogen in commercially available fertilizers (and is used as fertilizer itself). I can't imagine urea and fertilizer prices won't have an impact on wheat prices.\nhttps://twitter.com/JavierBlas/status/1453746602552737797\nhttps://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-seeking-resolve-issues-caused-by-power-curbs-higher-raw-materials-prices-2021-09-24/\nhttps://extension.umn.edu/nutrient-management/nitrogen\nhttps://blog-crop-news.extension.umn.edu/2021/10/with-high-fertilizer-prices-should-you.html"], [81456, "2021-10-28T19:50:12Z", [0.0, 0.19, 0.61, 0.18, 0.02], ""], [81456, "2021-10-28T19:42:44Z", [0.01, 0.22, 0.59, 0.16, 0.02], ""], [86554, "2021-10-28T19:35:22Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.54, 0.44, 0.01], ""], [1333, "2021-10-28T17:40:19Z", [0.0, 0.18, 0.59, 0.2, 0.03], ""], [99943, "2021-10-28T16:15:06Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.4, 0.55, 0.0], "If we skip the volatility, the forecast is headed to bin 4."], [691, "2021-10-28T15:30:39Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.8, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [99943, "2021-10-27T13:20:13Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.7, 0.25, 0.0], "Realizing that I shouldn't weight bin 4 too strongly, as wheat prices haven't yet tipped into bin 4, although they might well soon."], [100653, "2021-10-27T07:18:27Z", [0.0, 0.27, 0.63, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [56, "2021-10-27T03:08:58Z", [0.01, 0.32, 0.53, 0.13, 0.01], ""], [99943, "2021-10-26T22:44:09Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.5, 0.45, 0.0], "Prices haven't been in bin 2 since July and are currently trending upward, close to $300.

That means in effect that it is still possible to buy Belarusian potash and not be punished, although of course a lot of international companies will cut ties with BPC in case Washington changes its mind.   Even so, potash prices have already soared to over $500 per tonne, more than doubling from earlier this year. This is reminiscent of the US sanctions on the Russian aluminium producer Rusal sending prices up by a third in just over a week and causing so much chaos on the metal markets that the US Treasury Department (USTD) was forced to withdraw the sanctions again before the end of the year. And Rusal has less than 10% of the aluminium market, whereas Belarus has 20% of the global potash market\u2026   If the loophole reports are right then prices for potash will come down again, but there are a lot of European companies that rely on Belarus for potash, and foremost of those in Ukraine, which has been the big loser from the Belarusian sanctions. The Baltic states will also lose as most of the potash goes out through their ports earning them hundreds of millions of dollars a year.

A 7% drop puts it close to $260 so it's most likely to fall above there. That said the USDA is expecting prices to increase. To pass $300 prices would need to come up 7-8%, which is still a healthy increase so the middle bin seems most likely. It seems corn prices could push wheat up further as well and China will be very influential in that so will have to keep and eye on it.

Russia is expected to decrease exports because of export restrictions and lower production forecasts. In the US, people have been forecasting a record year for exports, but there are some drought concerns in several states. Wheat exports are forecast to be down a bit, though, because of rising exports from other countries and uncompetitive prices. Canada's production is expected to fall for 2021-2022, as is Australia's. (Also, Australia is in the midst of its worst mouse plague in at least decades, and many farmers are having to burn their crops because of it. If you haven't seen anything about this yet, Google \"mice Australia\" for horror movies and pictures. It is beyond your worst nightmares.) Overall, the USDA estimates that global wheat production will go up for 2021-2022, and that the farm price of wheat will average $6.50/bu in 2021-2022, up from last year:\n\"Global production is raised to a record with larger crops in the European Union, Russia, Ukraine, and the United States. Global consumption is revised higher with more feed and residual use, while global stocks are revised higher, mostly reflecting additional supplies in the European Union and Russia. Imports are raised for Turkey, Brazil, and Bangladesh, more than offsetting a reduction for the European Union. Exports are raised for Ukraine and India.

May price $278, and rising since late 2019. A general trend I see is to predict that wheat prices will be ~25% higher in 2021-2022, which seems reasonable.
