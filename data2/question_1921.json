However, I am a bit more pessimistic.  I will start with a Super Spreader analysis based on hospital admissions.  Comparing the 7 day hospital admissions total starting 2 weeks after a key event to the 7 day total before the event.  For Thanksgiving there was a 22.6% increase.  It was 8.1% for Christmas, but we were already pretty elevated then.  For New Years there was a decrease of  7.2%.  The 7 day total from 1/31 to 2/6 (pre Superbowl) was 70823.  The question resolution will be the 7 day total starting 2 weeks from the Superbowl.  If you buy into the super spreader theory - and assume the Superbowl was a superspreader event - then we would expect hospital admissions to be about what were just before the Superbowl if not higher.  I also think the new strains will have a bigger effect than most people think.  Everyone has gotten comfortable with the safety measures they have been taking.  But those won't be nearly as effective for the new strains.  In addition, it has been suggested that the new strains are more infectious because they deliver a higher viral load.   This could cause hospitalization to occur more quickly and lead to higher hospitalization rates https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/what-is-the-new-covid-19-strain-that-shut-down-england-u-k.html.  So we might be a bit too comforted by the recent drop in cases and hospitalizations. I am optimistic about the long-term value of vaccines.  But in the short term I think their effects on hospital admissions will be limited, especially given the extreme variation in eligibility rules across states.  My guess is that those currently getting the vaccine are also the people who are best at social distancing. So I am starting with probabilities more in the 45-75k range, hoping I am wrong."], [218, "2021-02-12T16:00:06Z", [0.1, 0.77, 0.13, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "From 2/1 to 2/11 hospitalizations fell roughly 20%.    \nhttps://covidtracking.com/data/charts/2-metrics-7-day-average-curves.

There are a few pressures being exerted on the opposite side however: 1.  Schools are reopening as urged by the Biden administration.  https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2021-02-12/us-schools-pressured-to-reopen-in-pandemic-to-get-new-cdc-guidance\nEuropean countries have kept their schools open by and large, and since Feb.1  and Feb. 11, their decrease in reported cases has been roughly 20%. https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/\nHowever, the danger isn't in the grade schools, it is in the universities.  College students are more likely to get a full blown case, and many continue to enjoy social life believing they are impervious to the virus, and thus are a negative force on falling case rates.\n\n2.  The hospitalization effects of the superspreader event (aka Super Bowl) will start to show up next weekend. (2/21)  That's a little late for this question, but there were parties all over this nation, and without a doubt there will be a bump in cases, with resultant hospitalizations 3.  2 new strains of the virus are on our shores - the UK version which by most counts is successfully avoided by those vaccinated individuals; and the South African version which can evade the antibodies produced by the vaccine.  Again - those effects will not be felt by 2/21, but something we should think about. That said - we are getting shots into arms much more quickly.  The USA has 14% of its population vaccinated.  https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations.  Obviously this has helped the hospitalization rate because the focus of the vaccines has been those most at risk of being exposed, (healthcare workers) and those most likely to be hospitalized and perish (the elderly) .  This has actually magnified the drop in hospitalizations because the administration of vaccine was so targeted to those likely to end up in a hospital.  Additionally, it is a sad fact that many of those most like to be hospitalized have already died. The virus made a job early on of wiping out nearly a whole age range of grandparents...   Given all of the above, I am thinking the drop in hospitalizations will continue, perhaps at a greater rate than the 20% we just saw because of more vaccinations.  Let's say it drops by 25% this next week.  That would put us at roughly 55,600 hospitalizations.  Remaining at a 20% rate of decrease would put us around 59,400.   Going heavy into the 45-60 range (because I don't think the negative pressures I mentioned above will be felt this early,) and doing some padding on the shoulders.

It's important to note that this is a slightly different metric than that which is being measured here, which is number of new admissions.  Using the drop in \"currently hospitalized\" as a proxy, though, which I think is fair given the fact that the two numbers ought to be positively correlated, we see that we've dropped to approx 80K in a month's time, or about 38%. Note that at least some of that drop likely has to do with the fact that a whole bunch of folks celebrated Christmas...less-than safely (hence the big bump), got admitted, and are now out. So I would expect that trend to flatten out, at least to some extent. Indeed, the data appears to show this. According to the data provided, the rolling 7-day total admissions has continued to drop over the last week, but at a steadily slower pace. 1-2 Feb showed a 3.3% drop, 2-3 a 2.6% drop, 3-4 was 2.2%, 4-5: 1.5%, 5-6, 1.4%, 6-7:1.1%, 7-8:1%. As of today, hospitalizations overall are falling in 38 states, remaining about the same in 12, and rising in only 1 (https://covidtracking.com/data/charts/14-day-change-hospitalized). This is not additive to the above note, but simply a further indication that the reduction in hospitalizations is not limited to a single region.  Also, it looks like our vaccination rate is fairly linear (https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations), and has been for the last few weeks, so I would guess that whatever effect it has on our rate of hospitalizations is already seen in the data we have today. In other words, I don't expect it to alter the trend significantly in the next three weeks. Finally, I don't see anything that would dramatically alter behavior to the negative in the next three weeks. Although some states might choose to open up, it appears that the federal push is going to be more cautious than the previous administration.  So let's say everything equal, we settle on a rate of about 1% decrease per day on the 7-day total admissions. That would put us at about 56.7K on the closing day of this question. Toward the upper end of the second choice in the question. I feel fairly comfortable that with the vaccination rate steadily climbing, we'll be able to maintain our downward trend. 1% doesn't seem crazy. I don't see anything having a significantly positive or negative effect either way in the next three weeks. We may see a slight bump post-super bowl, but I don't see it having an enormous effect.

Same 7-day rolling % shows a 2.14% reduction. Projecting this, we would be around 45K.\nSo, it seems clear that the number of admissions will be significantly lower than the ~ 80K at the end of January. Crowd majority predicts between 45K to 60K. What could impact this trend?\n- Vaccination. US is strong in vaccination, ranking 3rd worldwide [2], but, based on lessons from the top country, Israel, we will have to wait some time until we see improvement in hospitalization [3]. No impact.\n- Tests. A high % of tests performed improve early diagnosis and treatment, reducing the need of hospitalization. Some data shows that US as average is almost 94% test rate [4] and from other sources, only 7 States are lower 50% test rate [5] but catching up quickly. No impact.\n- Weather. Forecasting weather is a completely different issue, but we an assume that it will not be different in February on average than January. No impact.\n- Gatherings. Next and probably most important one will be the Superbolw, and the precedencts could be Thanksgiving and Xmas-Year end holidays. While admissions increased at that time, the trend didn't change significantly, if anything declining slightly. We can guess that there is more optimism but, if any, only small positive impact.\n- Beds and ICU utilization. One can expect that the % of beds and icu utilization could have an impact in hospital admissions, so that only more severe cases are admitted when %s are high. Using same data [1] we might see some pattern as avg increase in hospitalization decreased when beds and icu utilization reached max in Nov and Dec, but a lot more analysis is needed to conclude that. Also it's interesting that 7-day rolling bed and icu is not changing much  when the same rolling of admissions is increasingly negative. Slight positive impact.\n- Not familiar with the US health system, but a question could be if any Public Health Policy measure would have an impact in hospitalization. I could find a reference in the Biden-Harris plan to beat COVID19 [6] to \"Ensure everyone \u2014 not just the wealthy and well-connected \u2014 in America receives the protection and care they deserve, and consumers are not price gouged as new drugs and therapies come to market\". Even this might be good intentioned, it can take some time to really implement it. Slight positive impact.\n- New variants of the virus. Probably only experience we have on this is coming from UK [7] and South Africa [8], and they are not encouraging, with very quick increases in cases between end of Dec - mid Jan. The curve is not that steep in the US [9], so it is uncertain if new variants are still to see or it was better managed than other countries. Mid increase.\n- COVID policies. Arguably, most effective policy at the moment is lockdown, as UK experience seems to suggest [7]. There is a tension between health and economy [10] and good figures could relax measures that slow down improvement in hospitlization. Mid increase.\nToo pessimistic.
