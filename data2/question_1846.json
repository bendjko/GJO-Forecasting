Tom Brady is in fourth with 36 touchdowns and would need to throw for 8 in his next game. The NFL record for touchdown passes in a game is 7, meaning he is out based on past statistics. Mahomes has nothing to play for, with the Chiefs having clinched the AFC regular season title and a first round bye so he will most likely be sitting. Russell Wilson and the Seahawks still have a shot at the #1 seed in the NFC, as do the Packers, so I expect both QBs to play. Unless a major statistical anomaly occurs (Rodgers throws for 0 TDs - only occurred once this year) and Wilson throws for at least 6, maybe 7 (which would be an NFL record he would tie) to pass Rodgers, Rodgers is the winner.

If the averages hold, Rogers looks like he's the runaway fave with 48, though Mahomes isn't super far behind at 43.5 and Wilson is right there with 45.  Of note, Watson's been *killing* it in the last 6 games, with something like 200 passes thrown without a pick. That said, he'd have a *lot* of ground to make up, and they have to play the Titans and the Colts twice (though the Bears and the Bengals might give up some TDs). So what about the inside view for Rogers? They have the Panthers (ick), the Bears (ick), Eagles (ick), Lions (ick) and Titans (not bad) left to play. Rogers is likely to keep throwing TDs against that lot.  Inside for Wilson - Giants (ick), Jets (super ick), Washington (ick), Rams (decent), and niners (ick). Likely to keep throwing TDs here as well.  Inside view for Mahomes - Broncos (ick), Dolphins (ick-ish), Saints (that's gonna be a tough one), Chargers (ick), and Falcons (ick-ish). Mahomes will likely amass some pretty good stats, but he might just as well get a few more rushing TDs that Rogers would pick up as passing TDs.  If we're comparing the skeds head-to-head, Rogers has the easier road. Wilson has the easiest of the three, but he's sitting 2 behind Rogers right now and averaging slightly less per game. I think he has a decent shot to catch him, but it's not a lock. The one thing that gives me pause here is passing attempts per game. Generally, if the quarterback is making more attempts, they might just have a few more opportunities for their receivers to break one and put it in the end zone. This is also indicative of a team that might get down a lot and HAVE to score with passing TDs, which gives the QB more opportunities to pad the stats. Here, Tom Brady tops the list w/ 474, but of course he has an extra game under his belt. Rothlisberger is right behind him with 431 attempts so far, and Mahomes has 423 already. Wilson has 393 and Rogers isn't even on the list. SO! There may be an opportunity for a few more dogs' asses to get the sun shined on them. Be that as it may, all we're doing here is trying to figure out who will have the *MOST*, not by how *much* that QB will win.  SO! I'm putting most of my eggs in the Rogers and Wilson baskets. Rogers is already in front and has a pretty nice schedule. Mahomes might get close, but he might run a few in too, and his schedule is *slightly* more challenging. Brady might get desperate needing to get a playoff berth, so he might be put in a position to throw a few more, but he's pretty far behind. I feel pretty good about him not catching up. That leaves Wilson, who might be pushing to get a first place finish, but then so might the Packers. I'll be interested to come back here on Tuesday and see where we're at.
