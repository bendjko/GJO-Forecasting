New forms of cyber crime - crypto jacking, advanced phishing techniques, novel social engineering, exploitation of IoT are also emerging rapidly. Cyber crime techniques have mutated rapidly to counter the defenses being put in place. Growing mass adoption of mobile banking and social media  across the population is likely to increase the impact and frequency of cyber crimes. Awareness campaigns, counter measures, crackdown on dark web market places are unlikely to keep pace with the rate of development and deployment of cyber crime. Year to year crime rate growth, increase in public awareness of crime reporting sites such as IC3 are likely to result in an increase in the number of crimes reported at IC3.  The 375000 ~ 425000 confidence interval represents a 6.5% ~ 20% band of increase in reported crime which I think is a reasonable estimate. Considering the trend, a substantial decrease (325000 or less) marginal decrease or increase (within 325000 ~ 375000 band) than 2018 figures is highly unlikely (10% likelihood).
