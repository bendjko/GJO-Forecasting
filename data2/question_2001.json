However, Spotify is now the most popular podcasting platform globally and in the US (or soon will be). Their Q2 2021 financials show:\n- 2.9M podcasts in Q2, compared to 2.2M in Q1\n- Q2 Monthly Active Users (MAUs) grew 22% YoY \u2013 from 299M to 365M (although that includes all streaming not just podcasts)\n- \"The percentage of MAUs that engaged with podcast content on our platform improved modestly relative to Q1\"\n- Their target, with a lot of uncertainty, is 400-407M MAUs at year end (globally and not specific to US)\nSeparately there is some short term potential for churn in subscribers due to price increases/structure changes Comparing this with 2020 Q3 financial report:\n- 1.9M podcasts in Q3, compared to 1.5M in Q2 (so podcast content is roughly doubling YoY)\n- \"Of note, 22% of our Total MAUs engaged with podcast content in Q3 (up from 21% of MAUs in Q2 2020)\" \n- \"Q3 was a standout quarter for our podcasting efforts, beginning with the July launch of The Michelle Obama Podcast\" Bearing in mind this is only for one market player (albeit perhaps the biggest) and for global figures, I think the financials, increasing market share, and doubling of podcast content clearly show an expanding market. It just doesn't show how the US share relates to the total, or the monthly US listeners.\nhttps://investors.spotify.com/financials/press-release-details/2021/Spotify-Technology-S.A.-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Second-Quarter-2021/default.aspx From Insider Intelligence in July 2021, specific to the US:\n- Spotify is projected to become the most popular podcast platform in the US this year\n- demand for on-demand audio has increased in 2021\n- average time spent in the US is projected to grow 22% in 2021\n- podcasts are also projected to increase market share of all digital audio\nPerhaps most tellingly it states: \"In 2021 the number of monthly US podcast listeners will increase by 10.1% year-over-year (YoY) to 117.8 million\" but I can't see where that data is sourced from.\nhttps://www.insiderintelligence.com/insights/the-podcast-industry-report-statistics/ Based on all that, I'm still expecting approx 8.5% to 10.5% growth, giving a total of 44-46%."], [1333, "2021-09-23T13:07:31Z", [0.0, 0.2, 0.69, 0.11], ""], [79069, "2021-09-23T07:54:43Z", [0.0, 0.28, 0.7, 0.02], "I'm expecting an approx min of 8.5% and max of 10.5% growth for 2021, giving a total of 44-45%.\nI don't know whether the 41% from 2020 was rounded up or down, but the outcome looks close to the break between bins 2 and 3, and more likely to round up."], [99943, "2021-09-23T03:38:05Z", [0.0, 0.39, 0.59, 0.02], "I think I've been thinking about this question wrong."], [99780, "2021-09-22T22:41:31Z", [0.17, 0.48, 0.34, 0.01], ""], [100653, "2021-09-22T07:29:51Z", [0.01, 0.13, 0.72, 0.14], ""], [1333, "2021-09-21T13:26:26Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.74, 0.11], ""], [95503, "2021-09-21T10:17:19Z", [0.02, 0.28, 0.6, 0.1], ""], [100653, "2021-09-20T06:55:53Z", [0.01, 0.14, 0.71, 0.14], ""], [691, "2021-09-19T17:32:34Z", [0.0, 0.26, 0.68, 0.06], ""], [98345, "2021-09-17T23:06:57Z", [0.0, 0.45, 0.45, 0.1], ""], [62808, "2021-09-15T19:45:36Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [79069, "2021-09-15T06:29:54Z", [0.0, 0.22, 0.75, 0.03], ""], [100653, "2021-09-15T06:23:55Z", [0.01, 0.15, 0.71, 0.13], ""], [94872, "2021-09-15T05:32:56Z", [0.01, 0.26, 0.61, 0.12], ""], [55987, "2021-09-14T15:46:20Z", [0.02, 0.27, 0.61, 0.1], ""], [67312, "2021-09-14T12:10:17Z", [0.01, 0.43, 0.43, 0.13], ""], [1333, "2021-09-13T16:50:04Z", [0.0, 0.17, 0.72, 0.11], ""], [100653, "2021-09-13T07:43:31Z", [0.01, 0.15, 0.7, 0.14], ""], [691, "2021-09-12T16:13:09Z", [0.0, 0.28, 0.68, 0.04], ""], [1333, "2021-09-11T14:39:06Z", [0.0, 0.19, 0.7, 0.11], ""], [1333, "2021-09-11T14:00:07Z", [0.0, 0.27, 0.63, 0.1], ""], [96757, "2021-09-11T08:15:18Z", [0.01, 0.25, 0.65, 0.09], ""], [73687, "2021-09-10T02:44:14Z", [0.0, 0.31, 0.57, 0.12], ""], [94872, "2021-09-10T00:41:42Z", [0.01, 0.28, 0.59, 0.12], ""], [55987, "2021-09-09T16:05:52Z", [0.01, 0.33, 0.56, 0.1], ""], [79069, "2021-09-08T10:00:58Z", [0.0, 0.21, 0.78, 0.01], ""], [27661, "2021-09-08T08:57:58Z", [0.0, 0.32, 0.63, 0.05], ""], [100653, "2021-09-08T07:03:40Z", [0.01, 0.16, 0.69, 0.14], ""], [79069, "2021-09-07T21:36:35Z", [0.0, 0.28, 0.68, 0.04], ""], [55722, "2021-09-07T19:32:54Z", [0.0, 0.3, 0.65, 0.05], ""], [100273, "2021-09-07T13:10:34Z", [0.0, 0.19, 0.8, 0.01], "Dialed in."], [102449, "2021-09-06T19:48:39Z", [0.05, 0.25, 0.4, 0.3], ""], [94872, "2021-09-06T05:27:13Z", [0.01, 0.28, 0.59, 0.12], ""], [62808, "2021-09-05T21:00:40Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2021-09-05T16:02:59Z", [0.0, 0.36, 0.62, 0.02], ""], [57249, "2021-09-03T13:51:52Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.75, 0.2], ""], [1333, "2021-09-03T13:06:49Z", [0.0, 0.27, 0.63, 0.1], ""], [79069, "2021-09-03T06:13:15Z", [0.0, 0.3, 0.62, 0.08], ""], [67403, "2021-09-02T09:14:07Z", [0.01, 0.05, 0.64, 0.3], ""], [34959, "2021-08-31T08:33:20Z", [0.01, 0.17, 0.7, 0.12], "I've been racking my brain for a metric when I have spent some time considering this question.

The shows a steady interest in the search term \"podcast\", which I'm going to assume reflects primarily people searching for new content, but a smaller percentage of this is going to be people new to the format.  The nature of the google data simply tells us there's need a steady interest in the search term. By filtering for youtube searches only, you find there use of the term has been steadily increasing (with a peak around the week of April 11-17th, who did Joe Rogan interview that week?).

Between 2008 and 2021 the CAGR has been 12%. We can't assume it will continue at those levels but it gives us an idea of what CAGR is necessary for each bucket.\nFor 2021 we have 41% of US Population aged 12+.\n- We need below 2.4pp growth for it to stay below 42%\n- We need growth between 2.4pp and 7.3pp to stay between 42% and 44%\n- We need growth between 7.3pp and 17.0pp for it to stay between 44% and 48%\n- We need growth greater than 17pp for it to pass 48% If we look at how different age groups behave differently (pg58), we can see that age 12-34 are at 56%, while the 55+ group is at 26%. All groups show growth, so the trend seems to be positive for the overall number. I made some back-of-the-envelope estimates and found that there should be a 0.4pp increase from demographic shift alone. Though not zero, its not big enough to warrant refinement. Even with generous assumptions, the mix effect doesnt get much bigger than that. I don't know how relevant macro factors such as COVID and general news Cycle (US Election) are to the overall listening numbers. I could argue either way (once COVID dies down and we get past the US Election cycle people will listen less; or once COVID dies down people go back to community and will spend more time listening to podcasts), so i'm just going to generally add some uncertainty to the number because it might be true (though i havent seen data). TL;DR: \n1) All age groups are consuming more, across the board\n2) Demographic Age Mix will improve the % even if underlying numbers don't change, though this is a small effect\n3) I'm not including any data or analysis on news cycle or temporary boosts to Podcasting"], [24440, "2021-05-26T01:02:54Z", [0.1, 0.45, 0.4, 0.05], ""], [62808, "2021-05-25T23:24:37Z", [0.0, 0.14, 0.86, 0.0], ""], [101146, "2021-05-25T23:13:54Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.85, 0.1], ""], [81555, "2021-05-25T22:43:14Z", [0.25, 0.25, 0.45, 0.05], "Based on increased exposure and positive outlook of platforms.

The 44-48% range encompasses 4%, 5%, 6%, and therefore deserves a good look, especially on the lower end. 48% or more requires a staggering 7% jump which has not been seen in the data thus far - so podcasts would need to break all new audience ground this year to do this.
