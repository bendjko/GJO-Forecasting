In reality financial volatilities tend to change over time and be clustered. The recent period of high volatility means it's more likely that the volatility in the near future will be higher than the one assumed by the model.  Inside View:  News about the Trump administration considering fiscal stimulus measures raise the upside risk and increase the probability of yields going back up.

So this has become a bet on whether or not, and when, Trump decides to call a truce with China. The lack of predictability will not go away.  The global economy is weakening due to fear.  While the fear factor will ebb and flow, it will continue.   It is Trump's favored method of manipulation, of markets as well as voters.  Now he is demanding that the Federal Reserve lower short-term interest rates immediately by 1%, and also begin quantitative easing.  This would give the president room to continue the tariff war.  Neither the Fed nor the business community wants a continuing trade war.  And the Fed won't react to the presidential tweets, at least not quickly.  The uncertainty has caused the price of gold to break out on the upside.  Nobody knows how this will end, but the markets are predicting that it could end badly.

I think this is the main reason Treasury yields are quick to fall on bad news, but slow to rally on good news.

That premium sits at zero currently. Since the next Core PCE release isn\u2019t until 8/30, I think markets will continue anchoring to the lower number of 1.6%. That and concerns about global growth and the relative strength of US Treasuries should keep yields low.

I\u2019m going to try and break this into a smaller question since 5 bins can be a bit intimidating. First - \u201chow likely are rates to be above 2%?\u201d The 10 year is primarily driven by 2 factors:\n1. Expectations for future inflation\n2. Demand/Supply of 10-year notes Within the 2nd bullet, there are a few factors that affect supply and demand. \n1. Treasury issuance\n2. Flight to quality\n3. Fed action on short term rates\n4 uncertainty about future policy (term premium) Looking at 24 different scenarios related to the Fed, Brexit, and the US China trade war, I came up with 55% of scenarios involve yields less than 2, 25% involve yields right around 2 (1.9-2.1), and 20% with yields below 1.9. These estimates are tricky because the implicitly assume a longer time frame than the question.  Keeping my observations more short term, the st dev of the 10-year yield is low (need to do some more research) so I\u2019m focusing on big events that could shift it in the next 30ish days. The biggest (I think) is a 50bps rate cut that would posture a more dovish position from the fed and encourage a risk-on sentiment in markets, lowering yields. Brexit and China are important but feel longer term.  That 50bps cut is informing my 2.1 to >2.3 bins. The <1.7 to 1.9 is a function of slowing inflation expectations (probably reinforced by the Feds statement and widely agreed upon by CBs). The 1.9 to 2.1 bin represents my expectations that the market has priced in the big shifts already.  Will update based on the Feds rate decision, their statement and meeting minutes, a more quantitative look at rate movements over 30 day periods, and any news.

On the upside:\n- a sustained global equities rally would likely push rates to the 2.3-2.5% range ( what we saw in Q1, 2019)\n- quick trade resolution - low probability given systemic disagreements\n- inflation kicks up through increased spending in the US.

That being said, I share JP Morgan's directional sentiment given more recent developments with the caveat that a July rate cut will push the yield higher\n(https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-02/jpmorgan-cuts-u-s-10-year-yield-target-to-1-75-from-2-45)"], [578, "2019-06-25T21:50:29Z", [0.32, 0.32, 0.32, 0.04, 0.0], "My forecast is based on the yield history of the 10-year Treasuries in 2018 and 2019 [1], with the full understanding that past performances do not guarantee the future. I generated a plot of the daily yield of the 10-year Treasuries from 2018 to 2019. (I wish I could show the plot which would have made the following description easier and clearer.)  In the plot, one can divide the behavior of the yield into 4 regimes.   The yield gradually increased from January to November 2018 (Regime 1).  This was when the fed rate increased from 1.5% to 2.25%.  From mid-November to now, the yield decreased in 3 distinct steps: a gradual decrease from mid-January to mid-March 2019 (Regime 3) sandwiched between two rapid reductions (November to December 2018 \u2013 Regime 2, and mid-April to mid-June 2019 \u2013 Regime 4).  I am focusing on the 3 regimes of decreasing yields.  Interestingly the rates of the rapid decrease in Regimes 2 and 4 are very similar, about 0.28 percentage points per month while the one in the middle (Regime 3) is only 0.063 percentage points per month.  The question is whether the 10-year treasury yield will continue the rapid decrease as in Regimes 2 and 4, or switch to the much lower reduction rate as in Regime 3. or somewhere in between. If the rate reduction in the next two months follows the rapid rate (as in Regimes 2 and 4), the yield would be reduced to 1.54% (2.1-0.56).  If the rate reduction follows the slower rate (as in Regime 3), the yield would be reduced to 1.97% (2.1-0.126).   I use these two yields to bracket the forecast yield for 31 August 2019.  Given the continuing trend in the 10-year treasury yield, it is very unlikely that the yield will be above 2.3.  There is a slight chance that the yield becomes stable - 4%.  I will give the other 3 choices equal probability, for now.
