Starliner, which was built for NASA\u2019s Commercial Cargo and Crew program along with SpaceX\u2019s Crew Dragon, has been plagued by a series of costly delays. (This time, Boeing decided to swap service modules.) The company first tested Starliner in December 2019, but the mission was cut short after the spacecraft suffered a software anomaly preventing it from reaching the proper altitude to dock with the ISS. In August, Boeing scrubbed a second OFT 2 attempt after it discovered an issue with the propulsion system. If all goes according to plan (hopefully it does this time), the service module will launch atop ULA\u2019s Atlas 5 rocket and dock with the ISS, spending a total of five days in space. Later this year, the spacecraft will carry a crew of NASA astronauts to the ISS.\n\" via https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/nasa-is-plotting-its-return-to-europa-and-has-plans-to-slam-into-an-asteroid-all-in-2022/ar-AATzy9S & \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Orbital_Flight_Test_2"], [84880, "2022-04-12T21:19:48Z", [0.05], ""], [96618, "2022-04-12T08:58:31Z", [0.1], ""], [79508, "2022-04-11T11:10:42Z", [0.51], ""], [105620, "2022-04-11T00:39:37Z", [0.6], ""], [84880, "2022-04-09T01:13:10Z", [0.09], ""], [105396, "2022-04-08T21:09:38Z", [0.0], ""], [105998, "2022-04-08T15:49:23Z", [0.0], "Comment deleted on Apr 08, 2022 03:50PM UTC"], [88452, "2022-04-08T10:00:00Z", [0.88], "Having at least one technically feasible, cost-efficient and proven (certified) alternative spacecraft is not only the prerequisite of competition in the field, but also an essential back-up in case of failure of SpaceX and their different types of carriers to be able to maintain the ISS in the orbit and running in the medium term WITHOUT dependency on Russia's goodwill and Sojus system.
