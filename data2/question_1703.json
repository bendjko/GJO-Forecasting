Now, Bullock's departure is leaving the seat open. U.S. Rep. Greg Gianforte won the GOP primary. The upside for Republicans is that Gianforte is a former tech CEO with deep pockets. The downside is that Gianforte is best known for assaulting a reporter, which resulted in a sentence of 40 hours of community service and 20 hours of anger management classes. Meanwhile, the Democratic nominee, Lt. Gov. Mike Cooney, is well-liked and has a long resume in state politics, including service as secretary of state and state senator. But that opens the door for Cooney to be attacked as a career politician.  The latest independent poll, by the New York Times and Siena College, had Gianforte leading, 45% to 39%, with Libertarian Lyman Bishop receiving 4%. That follows a period of strong fundraising and aggressive campaigning by Cooney, and a risk-averse strategy by Gianforte. For Cooney to get all the way to 50% in a conservative state \u2013 and in a presidential election year in which a Supreme Court seat is at stake \u2013 will be challenging.

Since 1953, the Montana Governorship has entered into a near perfect 4 Term Political Party Cycle with ->\n1 - 1953-1969 - 4 Terms - Republican\n2 - 1969-1989 - 5 Terms - Democratic\n3 - 1989-2005 - 4 Terms - Republican\n4 - 2005-2021 - 4 Terms - Democratic https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_governors_of_Montana\u00a0\u00a0 In 2020, Democrats will be attempting to achieve a 5th Governor Term, given this has only occurred\u00a0once from 1953-2005 I will give ->\nR(outside) = 67% = 2/3\nD(outside) = 33% = 1/3 Due to both Republicans and Democrats having controlled the Governorship practically evenly since 1953 (47%, 53%) I don't attribute any special meaning that only Democrats have ever achieved a 5th Term.\u00a0 Looking Inside, Montana Gubernatorial is considered a tossup with a very slight Republican leaning for 2020 ->\u00a0 \u00a0\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Montana_gubernatorial_election#Predictions\u00a0 Averaging these predictions I get ->\u00a0\u00a0\nR(inside) = 54%\nD(inside) = 46% In choosing the weighting between Outside and Inside, I decided that ->\nW(outside) >> W(inside)\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a00.75 >> 0.25 While the Governorship is typically decided by very slim margins making the outcome difficult to forecast as expressed by Inside, I lean towards Outside given it is a Republican Leaning State (Cook PVI R+11) and the Cycle favours Republicans this election after the most recent 4 Democratic Terms. From this I calculate that ->\nR = 64% = 67% * 0.75 + 54% * 0.25\u00a0\nD = 36% = 33% * 0.75 + 46% * 0.25\u00a0 Given these percentages are relatively mild, I will push these values more to their respective extremes ->\nR = 80% = 64% * 1.25\nD = 20% = 100% - 80% Given the possible slim margin of victory for the Governorship I will review this forecast in September / October and adjust if necessary.
