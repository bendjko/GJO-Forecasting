Similarly Biden has be falling gradually throughout his term but seems to have found a floor around 42%, with him briefly dipping almost to 40% before quickly rebounding. Ultimately I think for Biden to drop to 38.5% something really need to go wrong for him. What I am seeing shows absolutely no indication that will happen. If anything I think a competent response against Russia, COVID progressing to the endemic stage, central banks beginning rate hikes to tackle inflation, and historically low ratings at the moment lead me to believe the path of least resistance is higher.

Thus far he's somewhat mirrored Obama's first term but lower by 6-7%, and at 500 days the lowest that would put him is still >40%.  There is no shortage of uncertainty right now though, primarily around inflation and gas prices that could push him lower. There's also obviously Ukraine, though that's been handled fairly well so far. Uncertainty there pushes both ways, being a wartime president is generally good, while responding weakly or mishandling the conflict could push him lower. We've seen movement of ~12% over the course of his presidency, so an additional 5% lower is quite a significant move. <38.5% was low even for Trump.
