At the end of June, they are about even (at about $400M).  At the end of July, Trump led Biden by about $40M [1].  But Trump's lead was reversed by the end of August, with contributions to Biden exceeding Trump's by $155M, resulting in Biden total contributions leading by $115M.  This reversal is likely due to the excitements generated by the two national conventions in August. I don't expect this trend to change in September for the following reasons.   (1)  There is nothing in the campaign calendar that could affect voters excitement - the first presidential debate is on September 29, too late to affect the contribution reporting for the end of September.   (2) The stock markets are at their highest levels. Moving even higher will not affect Trump contributors that much. (3) Black Lives Matter protests and related unrest have peaked, reducing these events as Trump's wedge issues for fund raising. (4)  I expect the contribution level to drop significantly to the pre-convention level (about $100M a month).  At this level of fund raising, it will be difficult for Trump to catch up by the end of September. Note that I am only talking about by the end of September.  Events beyond that could change the election and the contribution levels, such as the performances in the presidential debates and the potential availability of a Covid-19 vaccine in October.
