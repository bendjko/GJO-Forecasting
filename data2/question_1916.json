If the US averages 872 deaths _more_ than the EU _per day_, this question will resolve to \"Yes.\"  Currently the US is on a 7-day rolling average of 1,381 more deaths per day than the EU. The US has been over the 872 threshold every day since 30 Aug, or 19 straight days. The death rate in the US has been accelerating continuously and sharply for about 7 weeks while in the EU, the increase in fatalities has been slower and shows signs of tapering. Case growth has flattened at a very high level in the US and is diminishing from a much lower level in the EU. The EU has a higher percentage of people partially and fully vaccinated (the difference between partial and fully vaccinated is so significant in the US I wonder if there are data reporting errors). The EU has more disparity within member states than the US does within states. Without doing any research I attribute it more to supply issues than willingness to take the vaccine, though the states with lower rates (e.g., Bulgaria, Poland) tend to be relatively lower income nations with less educational attainment and state capacity to encourage vaccinations (such as France's controversial but successful system for requiring a digital pass to enter restaurants and other public spaces). Point being, I think despite having a higher overall rate of vaccination, the EU also has more \"low hanging fruit\" of people who will get the vaccine once it is accessible to them. I predict\n* the US will exceed the EU in average daily deaths for the rest of 2021, at least for 90% of days remaining..\n* the 3rd wave in the US will plateau and start to decline.\n* the Biden mandate for employers of 100 and above to enforce vaccine or negative test checks will either not go into effect at all (court injunction, etc.), or if it does, it will have a minor impact in the vaccination rate in 2021 (e.g., too little impact to incorporate in forecasts).\n* in both geographies, deaths will fall until mid-November, at which point they will start increasing again, coinciding with flu season.\n* any subsequent waves will hit the US harder than EU because of lower levels of vaccination and lower tolerance for restrictive measures. More specifically:\n* On 9 Oct: the US will have recorded 710,000 deaths; EU 775,000 (difference of 65,000)\n* On 30 Oct: 730,000 & 778,000 (48,000).

As with so many of these COVID questions the situation that 6 weeks ago was running with high degrees of projected certainty has changed (from a certainty perspective if nothing else) and so the objective imperative must be to adjust certainty (noting the underlying pain and discomfort I'm feeling in moving so far from the current crowd position). I have a feeling on this one that the current, fairly static crowd position may be more due to a lack of updated forecasts from the majority rather than a reflection of high to near absolute certainty of a \"no\" outcome....at least I hope that's what it is (as opposed to having missed something fundamental that everyone else but me has seen)!   Top and tail review of the question's forecast follows.\n ----------- \"Yes\" Factors to consider (i.e. increasing likelihood): -In the US: the stalling of the vaccine programme as progress hits the hardening divide between the \"willing\" and the \"unwilling\".  i.e. the rapid process the US enjoyed at the start of the year may have hit its apogee.\n-In the US: the steadily growing volume of anti-vax narratives and tribalism within the echo chambers of the already \"unwilling\" or the \"vaccine sceptical\" (likely reinforcing the existing stall rather than correcting it).  i.e. the current trend path is likely to continue over the question period.\n-In the US: incoming flu season (a worldwide concern) that whilst not directly attributable to this question (focused as it is on COVID attributed fatalities) will further pressurise the US Healthcare system that is already creaking in specific areas (resulting in a more general increase in mortality rates for all conditions).\n-In the US: the current trend path of case and fatality rates (well math'd by @Columbus [1]) that, on current trends, sees the US ending the year with approximately 10,000 more COVID fatalities than the EU (a noteworthy projection with a narrow and fragile margin of error for forecasting)\n-In the US: College football season (August to December 21) and its potential to become a major spreader vector [2].\n-In the EU: the slow but steady ramping up of vaccine rollout progress [3] and the general vaccine willingness of the EU population vs their US counterparts (more an issue of availability and accessibility in the EU than one of willingness)\n-In the EU: the aggregated performance and capacity of \"EU healthcare\" vs the US equivalents\n-In the EU: a return to lockdowns in response to a serious surge in cases & fatalities or a new variant is more likely to be accepted and complied with both politically and socially in Europe than it is in the US (very much my personal perception and recognising that the UK's woeful performance and political environment no longer influences the EU's statics).\n-In Both: similarities in political desire (sometimes despite medical advice) to reopen economies and reduce restrictions that seem likely (at this juncture) to see trend lines for both parties continue on their current upward trend paths without significant divergence. \"No\" Factors to Consider (i.e. reducing likelihood): -In the US: the inherent advantage in agility of response that the US enjoys over their European counterparts (as seen in the difference in speed of vaccine rollout programmes).  Impact on probability reduction questionable at this juncture given that Biden appears to be running out of options that sit within his direct remit and don't require bi-partisan cooperation from congress and at state level (which effectively nullifies this advantage for the US!).\n(ADDED)-In the US: New Executive orders that are applying a more directive and mandatory impetus to the vaccine roll out than has been seen to date.  Republicans are highly likely to howl about government overreach, wail about the rise of Communism in America and sue in friendly states in order to test these executive orders in what they hope will be their Trump card (pun intended) majority in the SC.  Never-the-less it is possible that these new measures may encourage the mildly vaccine hesitant (as opposed to the tiny minority of die hard hold outs) to roll their sleeves up as they did in France [4]. \n-In the EU: The EU being ahead of the US in cumulative fatalities by 106,287 [5] with four months of the question left to go\n-In the EU:  significant difference in starting population base rate (US: 333 million [6] vs EU: 447 million [7]) ---------------- With all the above hopefully being accurate, true, relevant and applicable (please feedback, comment and challenge) the (heavily revised) conclusions I've come to for this question are: 1.  The current trend path sees the US overtaking the EU by a small but significant margin at question's closure.\n2.  Current political and societal behaviours, attitudes and mitigating strategies do not seem likely to fundamentally change the current trend path within this question's timeframe (despite Biden's best efforts). \n3.  That most of the foreseeable change factors (new variants [8], new surges, general winter season illnesses etc.) are likely to affect both parties to this question fairly equally (in terms of impact on current trend path).  Exception to this might be college football season in the US which has significant potential to increase Delta variant spread (and therefore fatality rates and potential for new, more lethal US born variants).\n4.  The slim margin of projected difference between EU and US by 31st December 21 makes any forecast more vulnerable to the impact of the above change factors (and therefore less justifiably certain overall). TLDR Version: current data and reporting seems to require a 180 degree shift in projection from \"no\" to \"yes\" but with a fairly narrow certainty margin (slim differential at questions close, lots of potential routes to disruption of current trend paths for both sides).   With college football and the entrenched political positions in play in the US at this moment (and their noticeable impact on US COVID management performance) I'm revising up to just under a 2/3rds chance of the US recording higher fatality rates at this time (with some underlying concern that even that may be a little too confident in a \"yes\" outcome at this moment).

Not only because people need to be able to work, but because mental health is a real concern.  And people are starting to make their own judgements on what to do and when.  Having vaccinations going on will also foster a sense that that risks are lower and that is it more appropriate to make individual choices over risk, rather than governments. So in the EU it is going to be harder to impose lockdowns again this year than in the US.   In addition health is not something managed at the EU level it is a national activity, and half the EU states are relatively less well off and may struggle to procure and roll out a lot of vaccines.  And that\u2019s assuming that production of vaccines does not become a political / national issue.  The US has banned export of vaccines.  The other big player in vaccines has then the UK which is now not part of the EU and therefore it\u2019s not clear how interactions and contracts will work with that new dynamic.

However, there is reason to believe that the EU will see a greater toll in 2021.  First, underlying demographic factors will play a role.  EU population (~447.5M) and population density (112 ppl/sq. km) are both higher than in the US (~328.2M & 36 ppl/sq. km) (data.WorldBank.org). Also, the EU population is older than the US population, providing a larger proportion and total number of people over age 65 that are susceptible to severe cases of COVID (EU - 20.3% vs. US - 15.2%). Additionally, the initial vaccine rollout int he US (7.1 doses administered per 100 ppl) has been more successful than in the EU (2.3 doses administered per 100 ppl), suggesting that vaccination will provide adequate levels of herd immunity in the US faster than in the EU.  Additionally, more contagious strains of the virus seem more widespread in the EU at this point, although that will most likely soon even out in the US as the spread strains take hold in North America. Things that might change my estimate: More strict lockdowns in the EU and lessening of lockdowns or distancing policies in the US.  Comparatively accelerated vaccine rollout in the EU, or disruptions in US vaccination program.  Significant comparative differences in vaccine hesitancy rates."], [96367, "2021-02-03T15:25:42Z", [0.1], "Coming in low as a start point given that the US is coming into 2021 under the EU's fatality total by approximately 30,000* and the vaccine programmes for both suggest a diverging trend line over the question period. Given the likely difference in speed, effectiveness and raw buying power of the two Federal governments in their attempts to control the virus and rollout a vaccine programme I currently assess the US to have a significant edge on 2021's case and death rates.  Whilst the US certainly has its own political and social problems with stricter virus control measures (and will likely continue to have in certain pockets) this is likely to be mirrored by \"lockdown fatigue\" and increasing political & economic pressures across the EU. In the US the areas with less control measure compliance / greater control measure resistance seem to be the more rural, sparsely populated areas, whereas the opposite is true in several EU countries. The EU also appears to have a greater variance in healthcare quality provision across all its 27 member states than the US (although, for fairly obvious reasons, the US could be said to have a generally lower standard of healthcare per capita in comparison to specific EU nations [2 & 3]). The EU as a whole seems to have a greater generalised exposure to new and emergent virus variants given the collective difficulty in keeping them out and proactively controlling them once inside the free movement area.  The US has an inherently greater and more agile capability to respond effectively to new and emergent conditions, and with the renewed competency in government it can be expected to see this come into play more often. The EU also has less flexibility and \"emergency executive authority\" to \"gracefully extend\" [4] into the emergency's management and share healthcare resources (\"reciprocity\" in David Wood's language) across borders. As such conditions seem to forecast a faster falling death rate in the US now that competency, compassion and conviction has returned to its executive leadership.  The EU will continue to do its best but, so far, has shown little willingness to push the boundaries of its political, structural and constitutional systems to gain the kind of flexibility, agility and momentum that the US is working towards. To be reviewed with live figures as the year progresses, conditions change and their impacts are measured. *Using \"ourworldindata\" [1] for this as it seems to be an easier resource to work with than the WHO webpage, but I'm working on the assumption that the OWID team have already removed the UK from the EU's data (the UK officially left the EU in January 2020 although some places still consider the UK part of \"Europe\").  Had they now I believe the EU's fatality rate would have been skewed much harder upwards.

The US has purchased enough vaccinations to cover the entire population twice over, and is on track to have every adult who wants a vaccination vaccinated by summer. The EU also has enough to cover twice its population, but my understanding is many of these purchases came later, so the US likely has priority. Big factors in the question aside from speed:\n1.) Vaccine acceptance: Surprisingly US is actually favored on this one. Polls I've seen show several EU countries with abysmal vaccine acceptance.\n2.) Anti-covid efforts: I'd guess the US loses on this one. Among the people who won't get vaccinated here are likely a lot of people who also refuse to wear masks and take basic steps to suppress the virus. So even once everyone who has a vaccine wants one there will still be deaths and virus spread, just hopefully greatly reduced.\n3.) Medical prevention: I think this is probably about even, I think both countries will get better at keeping COVID patients alive at about the same rate.\n4.) Starting point: Cumulative deaths and daily deaths are at about the same place for both countries, so starting on pretty equal footing.

Additionally, recent fights over vaccine exports may have more an impact on the EU than the US, due to the proximity and relatively open borders with non-EU states. https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/30/world/europe/covid-vaccines-eu.html\nhttps://covid19.who.int/table\nhttps://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/covid-19-pandemic"], [58508, "2021-01-30T17:05:30Z", [0.2], "Became a bit more confident after thinking more"], [58508, "2021-01-30T17:04:01Z", [0.25], "Current numbers:\nUSA ~430k according to https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/cases-2019-ncov-eueea\nEU ~450k according to https://covid19.who.int/table In favor of EU having more deaths:\n- Much slower vaccine rollout so far: according to https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations, 2.55 doses per 100 vs. 8.42 for US\n- According to https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths, about the same rate of new deaths as US\n- EU population is ~450 million, compared to ~330 million for US In favor of US having more deaths:\n- Currently have more new cases according to https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases, although decreasing fast\n- Probably hasn't been hit by new strains as hard as EU yet Overall seems like EU is significantly more likely to end up with more deaths; I'll go with 25% here"], [97375, "2021-01-30T16:01:48Z", [0.55], ""], [98217, "2021-01-30T15:34:15Z", [0.9], ""], [95503, "2021-01-30T14:58:08Z", [0.05], ""], [98226, "2021-01-30T14:57:43Z", [0.2], ""], [95503, "2021-01-30T13:47:10Z", [0.15], ""], [95503, "2021-01-30T12:39:39Z", [0.2], ""], [14266, "2021-01-30T07:33:41Z", [0.53], ""], [60695, "2021-01-30T07:25:42Z", [1.0], ""], [94837, "2021-01-30T07:23:37Z", [0.4], ""], [88098, "2021-01-30T06:40:13Z", [0.35], ""], [98222, "2021-01-30T05:55:38Z", [0.55], "Already have higher number and likely to continue for some time, however with new measures beginning to take effect in the USA should slow the growth."], [22689, "2021-01-30T05:45:05Z", [0.8], ""], [63674, "2021-01-30T05:02:27Z", [0.22], ""], [14266, "2021-01-30T03:56:22Z", [0.25], ""], [754, "2021-01-30T03:55:38Z", [0.4], ""], [14266, "2021-01-30T03:43:34Z", [0.5], ""], [14027, "2021-01-30T03:15:26Z", [0.23], "Per the European CDC, as referenced by @jayb, [see https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/cases-2019-ncov-eueea. ] there have been 449,395 deaths in the EU.

EU clearly behind in the vaccination process and the US have had a slightly lower mortality rate to date than many large EU countries (Germany, Italy) [3].

That cumulative number currently exceeds the reported (WHO) U.S. death total by a few thousand..(https://covid19.who.int/table) For now I'll use the following source as an estimate for EU-country cumulative COVID death totals: https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/cases-2019-ncov-eueea. \nAs of the third week in January this source counts 449,395 deaths reported in the EU/EEA.
