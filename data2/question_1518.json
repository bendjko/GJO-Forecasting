Cursory review of Google News items related to \"corn planting\" [4] indicate no concern out of the normal. Overall, sentiment appears normal if not positive for weather in the month of May. Re: @bobrown and other's concern about ethanol prices leading to reduced demand, my reading of the survey methodology used in the resolution reports for this question (example at bottom of latest report [5]) is that farmers are surveyed on how much of their corn they've planted _of which they are planning to plant_. So, even if COVID-19 concerns do affect the _quantities_ of corn they intend to plant, it _should not negatively affect_ the responses to the survey as to their progress in planting the crops they intend to plant. The only thing that would seem to negatively affect the progress are weather and potentially labor, although I'm not even sure if that's a concern. Additionally, cursory review of articles online suggest that farmers likely needed to make a decision to plant a different crop some time back, and even if they did, they simply wouldn't be included in the denominator for the data in the survey. All of the above leads me to be confident in putting 100% in bin 4, >90% planted as of May 31st.

I believe this was primarily due to weather. According to to NOAA\u2019s national center for environmental Information, the 12 months preceding May 2019 were the \u2018wettest on record\u2019.      The increase at the end of May was due to some farmers facing deadlines to plant their crop to still be covered by federally backed insurance policies. [1] The Prospective Plantings report provides the first official estimates of US farmers' 2020 planting intentions [2]. The report forecasts a 7.3% increase in intended crop plantings from 2019. It also projected 3 million acres of prevented planting, down from 19.6 million last year.  For the most part, the report suggests that more corn will be planted. It does not indicate when it will be planted.  COVID-19 may affect the levels and timing of corn being planted. It might be difficult to hire seasonal workers to help plant crops during May  At this stage the data suggests that the 2020 schedule will be closer to the average, not 2019. However, caution needs to be taken due to COVID-19 and volatile weather.  Criticism is very welcome!
