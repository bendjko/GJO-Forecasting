I find the analysis by @kbarnard10 a helpful addition to my thinking about this question. Nov 12: Taiwan has lost an average 1.75 countries' recognition each year from Jan 2016 through 2019 (for a total of 7 states over this period). This period of time reflects a renewed campaign by the Chinese to encourage realignment to the PRC from Taiwan, following an eight-year period of diplomatic \"truce\" under Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou. The PRC threatened that if Tsai Ing-yen was reelected in January 2020 (in an article in the People's Daily), Taiwan would find itself without any diplomatic allies. It seems then that this base rate of losing 1.75 country allies each year should continue in 2020 and 2021, given the PRC's renewed commitment to destroying Taiwan's diplomatic recognition under Tsai's leadership. I'd put the rate fairly high given that there were no realignments yet in 2020. That said, given that a hard core pro-Taiwan president is leaving and the potential for a softer line from the incoming administration, if I were a tiny nation considering realignment, I'd do it after the hard-core administration leaves office and minimize any chance for adverse policy against me from the US. This takes my 45% probability down to 30%. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102519/\nNov 20: Checking the news today, I maintain my 30% forecast. The ROC's KMT party just unanimously passed two resolutions looking to strengthen relations with the US, both in terms of defense against Chinese threats through the Taiwan Relations Act and in terms of formal recognition by the US. This is surprising for the ROC given the potential to provoke China (but possibly a reflection of China's recurrent ADIZ incursions in the past month). Nevertheless, I think formal recognition by the US and a subsequent cascade of recognition around the world is a long way off.

However, it is reasonable to assume that the countries that have held out to this day are more staunch in their support of Taiwan. Thus, I\u2019m estimating down to 5 countries switching from 2021-2040. (Assuming of course, the status quo that the ROC is not taken over by the PRC) At this rate, over the next 20 years it is one county switching every 4 years, which is equivalent to 1 country every 48 months. The forecast period is from 9 Nov to 28 Feb. At the time of this forecast (1 Jan 2021) there are only two months remaining, and takeover of the ROC by the PRC appears unlikely. Since on average it is 48 months for a country to switch by my estimate, the chances are 2/48 = 4.2% of a country ceasing to recognize Taiwan by 28 Feb 2021.

Additionally, the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act establishes the Pacific Deterrence Initiative and allocates $2.2B toward assisting US allies in the region and countering China's malign behavior, which may halt further declines in Taiwan's recognition, or encourage a net gain (note the Act still has to go to the floor of both chambers of Congress to be signed next week). I'm going to drop my forecast a little as a result of these two factors.  11/20/20: Taiwan has lost an average 1.75 countries' recognition each year from Jan 2016 through 2019 (for a total of 7 states over this period). This period of time reflects a renewed campaign by the Chinese to encourage realignment to the PRC from Taiwan, following an eight-year period of diplomatic \"truce\" under Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou. The PRC threatened that if Tsai Ing-yen was reelected in January 2020 (in an article in the People's Daily), Taiwan would find itself without any diplomatic allies. It seems then that this base rate of losing 1.75 country allies each year should continue in 2020 and 2021, given the PRC's renewed commitment to destroying Taiwan's diplomatic recognition under Tsai's leadership. I'd put the rate fairly high given that there were no realignments yet in 2020. That said, given that a hard core pro-Taiwan president is leaving and the potential for a softer line from the incoming administration, if I were a tiny nation considering realignment, I'd do it after the hard-core administration leaves office and minimize any chance for adverse policy against me from the US. This takes my 45% probability down to 30%. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102519/"], [95797, "2020-12-04T21:25:19Z", [0.15], "@Jtrusz Jared, going with your base rate on this with a slight bit of increase due to uncertainty and possible opportunities with the inside view.   Even though 7 countries dropped since President Tsai was elected in 2016, none of dropped since her re-election in January 2020.  I would presume that the relationships that she has built with the remaining 14 (I'm counting the Holy See as a non-starter for bowing out) will only get stronger as the reduced number of countries is easier to manage.   The remaining countries are smaller countries, with smaller voices in global affairs.  They can relate to Taiwan's situation, and their recognition only increases by staying in the game.  However as @CatherineN stated below, China could offer a really good relief/development package to draw countries such as Haiti, Guatemala, Honduras, or Nicaragua into their fold, but is the juice worth the squeeze? Especially as China watches their dollars more closely with COVID and BRI priorities.  This logic can be applied in the Caribbean as well, most of the countries still listed do fairly well with the tourism industry but that has been impacted by COVID.  Will China make investments to draw them away from Taiwan?  With a COVID vaccine expected to rollout, these countries will likely wait and see what happens there before making any big decision.  Unless countries start dropping China in favor of Taiwan, Im not sure that China will go out of their way to individually lure the remaining countries.   However, the below may have impacts soon:\n1) RCEP signing could pull in both Oceania and Latin American countries, doubtful that this will have impacts by the end of February.\n2) BRI - based on what I am reading, increased dialogue and activity (BRI or separate trade agreements) are taking place more and more in Latin America each day.

Background: The US ceased to recognize Taiwan in 1979, and the Solomon Islands and Kirbati ceased to recognize it in 2019. This leaves only 15 out of 193 UN countries who still recognize Taiwan. Even the UN recognizes China's sovereignty over Taiwan, which enables China's flexibility to influence other countries to cease recognition of Taiwan.

So 5%, because why not?"], [96794, "2020-11-13T01:45:09Z", [0.15], "I'm having a hard time nailing down solid data with regard to base rates when it comes to ceasing to recognize Taiwan. Therefore, I'm going to set that aside for a moment and focus on those that recognize them now. Of the 15 states that still recognize Taiwan, 3, or 20% at one point stopped recognizing them, leading me to believe that they might have a slightly higher likelihood of doing so again, simply because they've already crossed that bridge once.  According to this paper (http://aacs.ccny.cuny.edu/2018conference/Dahmer%20Rich%20%20AACS%20paper%209-20-18.pdf), Taiwan's efforts to hold on to recognition in central America have centered around trade, aid, and investment, as well as involvement in regional intergovernmental organizations. The authors speculate, however, that as ideological incentives decline and PRC economic incentives increase, Taiwan will have to redouble their efforts. I was unable to find significant sourcing regarding more current strategies on the part of Taiwan (the paper was from 2018), but assuming things remained status quo, or perhaps even continued to decline relative to PRC's ability to pump money into the region, I'd suggest that the two Nicaragua, at least, might have a slightly higher probability of jumping off the bandwagon again. With regard to the other two, Nauru and St Lucia, Nauru might be thought to be at risk of defecting, as their neighbors in the Solomon Islands and Kirbati did not to long ago (ref @Foursight's analysis & sourcing), but Nauru also recently pledged their allegiance to Taiwan (again, ref @Foursight's notes).  That leaves St Lucia as the remaining one of the three that has already jumped ship and therefore might be expected to have a higher likelihood of doing so again. The prime minister recently traveled to Taiwan to celebrate its founding (https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3035240/taiwans-allies-dwindle-st-lucia-stands-firm-against-china...and yes, I realize the source, but the Prime Minister traveled, that's an indisputable fact), so that sends a pretty strong signal that St Lucia's on board, at least for the time being. So where does that leave us? I'd say that BRI has a strong pull for some nations - it's tough to turn down investment when PRC comes calling. I estimate that the PRC's redoubling of effort with regard to this initiative raises the probability somewhat in the near-term, at least relative to the longer term base rate we might calculate.  In addition to that, it appears to me that @Awisdomofwombats seems to have come up with some information regarding the ceasing of recognition. He or she has come up with a rate of about 1 a year and, given the amount of time left until 1 Mar, estimates the probability at about 28%. I like that as a starting rate, but I have a sneaking suspicion that there is something to be said for an exponential growth re \"strength of bond\" as the number of countries dwindles. In other words, the ones that are easier to peel off have been peeled off, and each one left requires an increased amount of effort on the part of PRC to get them to come over to their side.  To this point, most of the considerations moving me away from the base rate have trended downward, toward a lower likelihood. The one thing I think might offer a slight tip in the direction of greater probability is uncertainty regarding the US political situation. While on one hand the Trump administration has seemed to (at times) signal a hard line against the PRC, at least with regard to trade, the foreign policy has been somewhat schizophrenic, leading me to believe that the Chinese might consider the Biden administration on its surface a less desirable future (and therefore take advantage of these next 6 weeks to apply increased pressure and try to move some more countries in their direction), but I also think that the Chinese might actually prefer what they perceive to be an increasingly stable (if perhaps less favorable) position once a Biden administration is in place. SO!!! Starting at 28% and moving mostly downward but with a slight bump upward for the increased opportunity offered by the current window of political uncertainty vis-a-vis US domestic politics, I'm going to set the line at 15%.

For the four months from 11/2020 until 02/2021, we get 4*10 % = 40 %. factors: Taking into consideration my estimate for similar question (2) of 0% chance until end of Trump\u2019s presidency b/c of waiting for negotiations with Biden. Further adjusting for the settling in in 01/2021 (1/3 -> 0) and adjusting down (1 -> 0,9) as diplomatic world will start getting used to new US-foreign relations in 02/2021. I\u2019m left with my estimate of (0+0+0+0,9) * 10 % =  9 %.\nThe fewer countries have formal diplomatic relations with ROC, the more valuable their in/action becomes. Hence they are in better bargaining position (and under more pressure), so they might be tempted to negotiate and wait longer. adjusting base rate from 10 % -> 8 % (0+0+0+0,9) * 8 % =  7,2 %. I think US foreign relations will be willing to put a premium on avoiding bad PR right after transfer of power greater than China for opposite reasons, as the latter is playing the infinite game of foreign relations and US mindset still needs to evolve in that direction. -2%.\nGetting closer to 30th anniversary may be of some consequence for this very reason. -1%. what would change my mind? If Trump would take action to use POTUS-Power to prepare his own exile after office, or if he became active in Asian-Pacific politics. -> down.\nIf Biden would be quick to be specific in words and action concerning strategic action in the Asian-Pacific region in the first weeks after January 20th -> down.\nIf Xi Jinping himself would announce sth. specific concerning action in the Asia-Pacific region -> up.
