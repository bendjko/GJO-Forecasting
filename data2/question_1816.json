G. (2021, July 26). Boom Tests Vision System For XB-1 Supersonic Demonstrator. Aviation Week. Retrieved from\nhttps://aviationweek.com/air-transport/aircraft-propulsion/boom-tests-vision-system-xb-1-supersonic-demonstrator Supersonic airliner developer Boom is evaluating a forward-looking vision system (FLVS) as part of preparations for flight tests of the XB-1 high-speed demonstrator as well as design planning for the follow-on full-scale Overture passenger aircraft. Similar to the External Vision System (XVS) developed for NASA\u2019s X-59 Quiet Supersonic Technology low-boom demonstrator, the FLVS will provide a virtual view of the runway to aid pilots in approach and landing. Both the X-59 and XB-1 have long noses which, unlike the drooping nose section of the long-retired supersonic Concorde airliner, are fixed\u2014and present visibility challenges at the high angles of attack required for landing highly swept wing designs. The system has been flight tested at Mojave Air & Space Port, California, using a specially modified Velocity\u2014a kit-built canard pusher design. The aircraft was selected because it \u201cwas able to achieve speeds on approach similar to that of XB-1,\u201d says Boom. \u201cAnother benefit of using this aircraft was the pusher prop, which allows the camera system to be easily mounted where it was unobstructed,\u201d adds the developer. The FLVS incorporates two cameras, a multifunctional display, a data acquisition system, an inertial navigation system and, after a series of flights, was deemed acceptable for use in the XB-1 by Boom test pilots. Testing included more than 50 approaches under a variety of conditions including crosswinds, haze and into the glare of the rising sun.  The FLVS will be installed by the nose leg of the one-third scale XB-1 demonstrator which is expected to begin flights later in 2021 or early 2022.

Why rush and risk a failure? I am curious if there is an incentive to test a prototype that is not supersonic capable in order to meet the deadline (for financial reasons perhaps). For example, specific components needing further development before the prototype could physically reach supersonic speeds (e.g. an engine not powerful enough as it stands). Somewhat unrelated, the market for this is curious. The statements made related to the United deal suggested (without detail) the aircraft would be carbon neutral. I am slightly sceptical about how this will work or 'fly' politically. Supersonic flight over land is tightly regulated in many places. Perhaps the trans-Atlantic & trans-Pacific routes provide enough of a market. Are the EU and US likely to relax rules to allow Europe-Far East and Europe-West Coast routes, where the supersonic travel is most advantageous? Is there a way to create routes from the Middle East hubs that overfly the Indian ocean, and southern Asia (India, Pakistan, Iran (!), and Chine to access those Far East routes - esp.

The FAA rules for supersonic flight [4, 5] is indeed a concern, but truth is that, for the question to be answered positively, the aircraft does not need to actually go supersonic; a simple \"dry run\" test (take off, fly around for a while, and land without even attempting to go supersonic) will be more than enough for a successful first flight (in fact it is certain that there will be several subsonic test flights before the first supersonic attempt; we call it \"envelope expansion\"). And it is due to this possibility that I am maintaining a 18% chance - not that I expect any actual supersonic flight before 2022.
