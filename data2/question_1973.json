Such a misstep has the potential to put the majority of his colleagues offside and result in his removal as Liberal leader and Prime Minister. While it's very unlikely that this series of events would occur in such a short period of time, particularly with Scott Morrison who seems adept at maintaining loyalty within the Liberal party, it should never be discounted in Australian politics these days.

I don't think our PM will be rolled, for the non-Australians, this mean replaced by his own party. We elect parties here and not PMs, and as a result a party can replace their leader following their own internal rules. This was part of the infrastructure that resulted in 10 prime ministerial terms in 11 years. As a result of this the LNP (Scott Morrison's Party) has adjusted their party room rules to require a two-thirds majority vote from there elected representatives (1) in order to overturn their leader.  We also need to consider the build up and the time taken to undertake a spill motion. 4 days for the last spill (2), but months in plotting and disappointing public polling is normally the build up - newspoll is the obsession for anyone interested, and he was leading 52-32 as preffered PM (3) last week. His approval rating is too high and the two-thirds majority insulates him too well for a spill to be realistically considered.  Next we have to consider an election. We don't have fixed term parliaments, and thanks to vaccine rollout delays (4), and what feels like a never ending festival of misogyny that is the LNP at the moment, I would think it's unlikely he will call one until long after we begin rolling out homemade Covid vaccines.  And even if he does call an election soon, we need to follow electoral procedure (5). The our final polling day falls on a Saturday somewhere between 41 - 75 days after calling the election which is marked by the dissolution of parliament. The latest this polling day that can resolve this as a yes is Saturday August 28th, and even that assumes a near immediate result. So for this to resolve as yes, he has until Friday July 16 to call the election at the latest, to then lose that by a landslide. More likely, there will be acceptable delays in the procedural steps and counting will take a week or so. I'm thinking if he hasn't called an election before mid June, the chances of a different PM on the closing date will be close to 0%.  1. https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/dec/03/liberal-party-morrison-changes-rules-to-require-two-thirds-majority-to-unseat-sitting-pm\n2. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Liberal_Party_of_Australia_leadership_spills\n3. https://www.news.com.au/finance/work/leaders/scott-morrisons-approval-rating-plummets-in-latest-newspoll/news-story/00cfbf114863625c68d8cb64fb78e848\n4. https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/health-problems/federal-government-defends-delayed-rollout-of-covid19-vaccine-despite-missing-detail-over-key-dates/news-story/4414685c3faf64c5d59e41e6c3bf200d\n5. https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/Practice7/HTML/Chapter3/The_election_process"], [94661, "2021-04-07T16:00:26Z", [0.15], ""], [99706, "2021-04-07T15:55:32Z", [0.06], ""], [100143, "2021-04-07T15:11:30Z", [0.06], "4/7/2021 Thanks to @smitch15 information and insight about early voting that's less likely to happen and Morrison's staffer's sexual allegation instead of him directly, I'm knocking my .16 by .10 (.5 each).

Using this wiki article [1] it appears that of the 11 prime ministers since 1970, 8 were in power for longer than three years. That metric implies a rate 3/11 ~ 25%. That definitely seems pretty high, but it provides a decent base rate. Obviously, some that lost power within three years of election lost in time periods before 2.5-3 years, so the base rate may be more like 1/11 ~ 10%.  Looking more closely at this situation in particular, a PM can be replaced due to a) death\nb) loses an election\nc) resignation Since Scott Morrison is 51, the probability of death is about .5% [2].  An election occurs once every 3 years, and since the last election was held in 2019, the only way an election occurs is if there is an early election. So, this question is mainly asking about the likelihood of a vote of an early election and, if so, does the liberal coalition lose. The only way this seems to occur is \"A Double dissolution\" where the two chambers cannot agree on certain bills. Since, the liberal coalition controls both chambers, this seems highly unlikely to occur. However, there are enough votes in the senate to hold everything up between labor and the other minor parties. So, they could potentially force another election that way. The current split in the House of Commons and the Senate is very close, with the liberal coalition holding a very slight edge over labor in both. I see no advantage in the current liberal coalition calling an early election.  The other way Morrison could be removed is if he decides to resign or the political pressure from this rape and sexual assault allegations results in his resignation. This doesn't appear likely right now as the allegations are not directed at him but at a staffer, but it certainly remains a possibility.

According to most recent polls, he's still in a relatively strong position after his handling of the pandemic situation in Australia. See https://bit.ly/31PHfFL. As it often quoted \"A week is a long time in politics\" (Harold Wilson 1964) as things can move quickly in politics. Currently, the most likely challenge facing Morrison is the handling of various sexual harassment and alleged rapes that infer a widely held misogynist attitude in the Australian parliament. See https://bloom.bg/3mkXB2y / https://bit.ly/3rPJinV / https://bit.ly/3cOQ9tC / https://bbc.in/2PZanrG / https://bit.ly/3cRcd6J  Morrison has reshuffled his cabinet and removed two of the individuals purportedly responsible for either poor handling of allegations (Reynolds) or direct misconduct (Porter ). He's also creating a new taskforce to investigate and address the issue of women's safety, equality, health etc ; https://bit.ly/3cRcd6J.  As @bobrown pointed out, the vaccination program is not doing very well (https://bit.ly/3dA5cXg). However, looking at the polls quoted above, Morrison's approval has certainly increased since the onset of the pandemic. On the other side of the equation, Albanese, the leader of the opposition Labour party does not seem to be presenting much opposition to Morrison. As Labour and the Liberal / National coalition are the major forces in Australian politics, it appears that for the time being, Morrison's position is relatively safe. However, as above, things in politics change quickly. Equally, Australia's TPP voting system has all the potential to complicate matters (https://bit.ly/3wCjO19) albeit that may not directly affect the the outcome of the question.

Leadership spills: \"In December 2018 Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced a change to the rules for election of the leader of the Liberal Party: if an elected Liberal Party leader goes to the election, wins that election and becomes prime minister, they will remain prime minister for the full parliamentary term. They will not be able to be removed from office. That could only happen \u2014 as a safeguard \u2014 by meeting the very high bar of a special majority two-thirds vote. Mr Morrison did not face a leadership spill following the Coalition Government\u2019s victory at the 2019 federal election.\" Therefore Morrison is playing by different rules that his predecessors that were voted out by their caucus' and makes him far less likely to be tossed out from within his party."], [34959, "2021-04-04T13:30:00Z", [0.01], ""], [80790, "2021-04-04T10:00:40Z", [0.13], ""], [80790, "2021-04-04T09:59:32Z", [0.57], ""], [94872, "2021-04-04T01:55:37Z", [0.05], ""], [92079, "2021-04-04T01:44:23Z", [0.0], "0"], [98871, "2021-04-03T23:28:31Z", [0.15], ""], [87099, "2021-04-03T23:01:28Z", [0.0], "The next election is within the next 12 months so short of Scomo being caught lying to parliament, they have to run with him.
