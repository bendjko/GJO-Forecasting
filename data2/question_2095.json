If omicron is 2x more transmissible than delta (and using delta\u2019s doubling rate as a model), the estimated time to 70% of cases being omicron is ~mid march. However, reports in UK and Denmark state the doubling rate of omicron variant cases is 2.5 days, with an estimate of 50% of covid cases consisting of omicron variant within the next two to four weeks (as of Dec 9, so by January 9th). First case was found Nov 27th (UK) and Dec 1 (US).  To further drill down, as of Dec 16th omicron is 3% of cases in US with an estimated doubling rate of 2-3 days. Based on this model, the earliest we reach over 70% is Dec 27th and latest is Dec 30th.

The current percentage of cases that are Omicron. The CDC's \"Nowcast\" data (part of the question resolution data) just came out for the week ending Dec 11 and estimates the percentage of cases due to Omicron for that week at 2.9%, range 0.2% to 14.7%. In a previous version of this question, we all noticed that the Nowcast numbers tend to get revised upwards over the following week or 2; there is considerable uncertainty. I think 0.2% is extremely unlikely based on the data we already have; I will guess that this estimate will ultimately be revised to 4-8% or so. But the outcome of this question is obviously highly dependent on the seeding number now. So, let's consider the case that 3% of cases on Dec 11 were caused by Omicron, which is a big underestimate because 2.9% of the cases for the whole previous *week* were Omicron. Even in that case, bin 3 looks all but certain now, as Omicron would be predicted to overtake Delta even before the end of the year. As in, with Delta cases continuing to grow towards a peak of, say, 150k-200k/day in early January, Omicron can be expected to overtake Delta before the end of the year (ignoring the dip in reporting over the holiday, which will reduce reporting proportionately for all cases).

When Omicron hits, the growth in daily cases will change from linear growth to exponential growth. Doubling time is now 7 days in South Africa, but cases are only slowly rising in the UK, and are flat in the US [3]. The UK is not seeing exponential daily case growth today, and the US is 2 weeks behind the UK. There's just not enough time for Omicron to spread widely in the US before January 15th.  I am reducing my probability for the January 1 to 15 time period to zero. There are about 12 weeks until March 12th. In these winter months, daily cases might decrease, while the Omicron share increases. Both Omicron and Delta will spread among the unvaccinated, while mostly Omicron will spread among the vaccinated.  Omicron spread will slow as the vaccinated change their actions in reaction to news reports.

So, there were probably at most ~50 flights/week from affected countries to the US, or, say, at most 100 flights in the past 2 weeks, which have seen Omicron cases surge. This would put an estimate of the number of cases already in the US somewhere in the ballpark of 500. We still have way too little information to make firm estimates about anything, but with an estimated doubling time of 5 days, this would make bin 3 implausible. The one factor that keeps bin 3 in the running, imo, is seasonality, as what little data we do have are from spring in SA, whereas Omicron is now heading into winter in the US, which will increase Rt. We have yet to see what it can do in the US. (Oh, and it's very possible that people could be infected with Omicron right after or before Delta or simultaneously.

The risk of recombination is small, but each coinfection poses a risk. Only a handful of coinfections with 2 variants have been reported to date, but because of its antigenic differences, Omicron would pose a uniquely higher risk of coinfection among all variants detected to date. It's almost stupid to mention this possibility because the risk is small and recombination may have little effect if it does occur, but it was on my mind, so I wrote it here lol.

It's also important to remember that many downplayed Delta early on because \"we didn't have enough data,\" when Indian health professionals told us to be concerned; we don't need to be able to draw firm conclusions to be very concerned.\nA number of Nu cases have so far been identified in vaccinated people.

Thus, it is conceivable to me that a variant that supersedes Delta to become dominant in SA at the end of November could spread to and within countries faster than Delta did and could become dominant in the US by mid March.\nAlso, note that it's possible that this variant may already be spreading at higher or similar numbers in countries other than SA. It may simply have been detected first in SA because of greater surveillance and because it is causing a surge on top of a very low baseline of Delta cases. In other countries, particularly those with greater Delta spread and/or little surveillance, it could easily go undetected for quite a while.

The larger the number of active Delta cases, the harder it is for a non-Delta strain to achieve the 70%+ threshold.\n- There are still no new Variants of Concern beyond Delta, or even Variants of Interest, according to the WHO's variant tracker\nhttps://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/\nCorrespondingly, the odds of a new, non-Delta variant arising now and propagating to > 70% prominence within the question timeframe are, again, exceedingly improbable (especially given the typically multi-month timeframes over which the historical new variant propagations have unfolded).\n- Delta variants currently account for 99.9%+ of all currently active cases, and have \"topped the charts\" for a very long time now.\nhttps://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions I recognize that these links have been previously given by others in the comments below, but am re-including them for convenience.

Then it will take some time before that new variant makes its way to the US.

Previous troughs were about 400 thousand in February and June 2021. Projecting this, a new trough might occur in October. New variants took hold soon after the previous troughs (February trough, April Alpha variant dominant, June trough, July Delta variant dominant).  The Alpha variant was first identified in September, and in April became prevalent in the US [2].  Delta was first identified in December 2020, and in July was prevalent in the US. Both Alpha and Delta first occurred outside the US. Based on this, it might take 7 months from when a new variant is identified outside the US to US prevalence.  There are several variants of interest [3].  Lambda and Mu were discovered more than 7 months ago, and so seem unlikely to take over. There are 14 additional \"designated Variants Under Monitoring\", but only one was discovered recently:  C.1.2 discovered in South Africa, May 2021.  Both cases and deaths are now declining in South Africa, and so it is unlikely C.1.2 will be a problem.  I do not see any new variant first identified outside the US becoming prevalent in the US until after April 30th (7 months from now). A variant first appearing in the US will take less time to spread in the US. There are plenty of new US cases giving the virus chances to mutate (100,000 new confirmed daily cases). It took 3 months for Delta to grow from 1% to over 70% in the US (April to July). This might show up in one region first. Several states have over 3% of cases marked \"other\" in the table of Variants of Concern by State [4]: Texas 4.48%, Florida 4.80%, Illinois 4.29. But I don't see any growth of \"other variants\" in the bar chart by region. All regions are under 2% other variant.

Even among the unvaccinated, however, there is now probably some (insufficient!) protection against future infection because of the significant number of people who have already contracted/recovered from at least 1 previous COVID infection.

A new study, just put up on BioRxiv, finds that, \"#Mu variant (B.1.621 lineage), a new #VOI, is highly resistant to the antibodies induced in COVID-19 convalescents and vaccinated people.

Looking at the numbers, I calculate ~2988 cases in the week ending June 19 (3.7% of all cases) and ~2168 cases in the week ending Aug 28 (0.2% of all cases). Meanwhile, the relative frequency of Mu cases has gone down as Delta has spread. That just says that Delta is more transmissible. But once the Delta wave has subsided, Mu will likely have the advantage. The question is, how much of an advantage will it have over Delta and other strains this fall and winter?

If either were to become the next dominant strain, it would probably take at least 3 months to do so. But 1) neither may be fit enough, 2) there may still be enough Delta around to prevent either from reaching >70.0% of strains, and/or 3) they could compete with each other to the extent that neither becomes dominant.\nI still think bin 3 is unlikely, at least for now. But I'll increase bin 3 a bit. There's really no way to know where Lambda or Mu will go at this point, but there are a few things in their favor:\n1. Given all the surveillance that's happening all over the world, a strain will be identified before it starts to represent a large number of cases. Lambda and Mu have been identified.\n2. More studies are needed, but it appears that Lambda and Mu are both highly transmissible and immune escape variants. When Delta emerged and was found to be highly transmissible, it became clear that it would become dominant everywhere it went. If Lambda and/or Mu turn out to actually be highly transmissible and escape some amount of immunity (which seems extremely likely to be the case), then once enough cases are around that one of them doesn't stochastically become extinct in the US (we're probably already past that point), it will spread.\n3. No other variant that I know of that is not of the Delta lineage is thought to be both highly transmissible and to escape existing immunity to a meaningful extent.\nA lot remains to be seen, and variants only rarely become dominant, but at least two of my antennae are now focused on Lambda and Mu.

Secondly, we have to consider the speed at which a new variant will be formed and identified. This takes time, but the more infections we have the more compressed that timeline is. Delta was first discovered in December 2020 and it took 7 months to reach the US and hit the 70% threshold. Third, we have to consider where the next variant is going to appear. India was ripe for a variant with the speed and spread of cases. In another country, the speed of spread and ability to jump borders might be lessened. We could also have it appear here in the US with our infection numbers rising. Fourth, the number of people who can be infected (barring something that bypasses our current immunities) is dropping. Fewer people capable of being infected and spreading this means fewer people to create variants and fewer people to spread any variants.

Therefore, new strand is only likely to exceed the growth rate of Delta if it is more contagious than Delta. The most likely way for that to happen is to be resistant against Delta while being susceptible to another strand. That requires two conditions - immunity and mutation, followed by spread.

So, it would be reasonable to guess that it could be another 2 to 4 months until another strain becomes dominant. But when *one* strain represents more than *70%* of cases is another question. Also, it's quite possible that the next strain to become dominant in the US could be an immune-escape Delta sublineage, although the world is certainly busy brewing up a lot of other options, including Lambda. It will take a new variant that reaches values of Rt (like R0, but varies over time) greater than those of all others that are circulating to get to 70%.\nDelta still has no real competition that we know of, so I think bin 1 is almost out of the question. But I think the rest of the field is wide open.
