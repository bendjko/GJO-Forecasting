The market conditions for tech IPOs won't get better than this:\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-ant-group-ipo/ant-groups-ipo-sees-record-3-trillion-in-retail-demand-idUSKBN27E1VU / News and details of the AirBnB IPO drop in at a faster pace than, say, two weeks ago, the brand seems to get closer to finalization and wants to make use of the marketing and PR value of remaining the \"talk of the town\", now AirBnB appears to play the \"good corporate citizen\" card to get rid of old conflicts and earn sympathies:\nhttps://www.bloombergquint.com/onweb/airbnb-creates-endowment-advisory-board-for-hosts-ahead-of-ipo All of this to me currently indicates a quick IPO with a high price range, a first price at the top of the price range and, most importantly, a successful trading on the first trading day with maybe 10 to 20% gain versus initial pricing (Rocket Companies achieved roughly 20% gain on the first day). Splitting the privately held stock before the IPO makes it appear more affordable and reasonable to retail investors and likely increases demand further. Axios sees the IPOs of Doordash and AirBnB placed at some point between Thanksgiving (26 November 2020) and Christmas.\nhttps://www.axios.com/ipos-stock-market-volatility-f26f5b56-d3e9-4562-831d-12020a418daf.html EDIT:\nAnt Financial just suspiciously withdrew its IPO two days before execution for the reason of \"important changes in the regulatory environment\", whatever that means..."], [1333, "2020-10-31T13:36:11Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.25, 0.25, 0.45], ""], [1333, "2020-10-29T18:40:39Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.25, 0.15, 0.45], ""], [1333, "2020-10-29T18:39:13Z", [0.0, 0.24, 0.25, 0.06, 0.45], ""], [13306, "2020-10-29T17:05:36Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.05, 0.75], ""], [172, "2020-10-29T15:37:56Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.0, 0.0, 0.85], ""], [691, "2020-10-29T15:26:17Z", [0.0, 0.08, 0.21, 0.08, 0.63], ""], [27661, "2020-10-28T19:56:05Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.6], ""], [27661, "2020-10-28T19:20:42Z", [0.0, 0.09, 0.13, 0.15, 0.63], ""], [56, "2020-10-28T18:00:47Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.4], ""], [6978, "2020-10-28T16:44:04Z", [0.01, 0.24, 0.25, 0.0, 0.5], ""], [88452, "2020-10-28T15:42:22Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5], "Pre-IPO stock split announced."], [13306, "2020-10-28T11:10:53Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.23, 0.07, 0.7], ""], [95444, "2020-10-28T07:15:02Z", [0.0, 0.08, 0.27, 0.13, 0.52], ""], [95444, "2020-10-28T07:14:32Z", [0.0, 0.08, 0.27, 0.12, 0.53], ""], [34959, "2020-10-28T04:00:10Z", [0.0, 0.11, 0.27, 0.3, 0.32], ""], [30400, "2020-10-27T12:45:21Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [1333, "2020-10-27T10:36:46Z", [0.0, 0.24, 0.35, 0.06, 0.35], ""], [13306, "2020-10-27T07:43:55Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.1, 0.7], ""], [95444, "2020-10-26T17:20:52Z", [0.0, 0.09, 0.31, 0.12, 0.48], ""], [87854, "2020-10-26T12:22:56Z", [0.01, 0.06, 0.07, 0.01, 0.85], ""], [13306, "2020-10-26T06:47:50Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.15, 0.15, 0.7], ""], [27661, "2020-10-25T19:54:40Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.15, 0.12, 0.63], ""], [1333, "2020-10-24T16:07:19Z", [0.0, 0.24, 0.45, 0.06, 0.25], ""], [95444, "2020-10-23T18:58:01Z", [0.0, 0.02, 0.35, 0.15, 0.48], ""], [13306, "2020-10-23T06:40:17Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.06, 0.14, 0.8], ""], [34959, "2020-10-23T01:14:33Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.3, 0.35], ""], [27661, "2020-10-22T09:57:07Z", [0.0, 0.13, 0.19, 0.08, 0.6], ""], [172, "2020-10-21T19:42:47Z", [0.0, 0.35, 0.0, 0.0, 0.65], ""], [13306, "2020-10-20T22:50:38Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.12, 0.83], ""], [13306, "2020-10-19T20:33:16Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.15, 0.05, 0.8], ""], [94435, "2020-10-19T19:08:15Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.22, 0.07, 0.7], ""], [88452, "2020-10-19T19:02:46Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [691, "2020-10-19T14:43:15Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.57, 0.08, 0.2], ""], [95444, "2020-10-19T05:10:21Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.37, 0.13, 0.4], ""], [35217, "2020-10-19T04:44:12Z", [0.01, 0.16, 0.15, 0.03, 0.65], ""], [56, "2020-10-19T03:00:13Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.3, 0.3, 0.35], ""], [85986, "2020-10-18T22:22:40Z", [0.0, 0.21, 0.42, 0.17, 0.2], ""], [85986, "2020-10-18T22:20:51Z", [0.0, 0.21, 0.53, 0.21, 0.05], ""], [95823, "2020-10-18T19:26:07Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [87854, "2020-10-17T10:25:18Z", [0.03, 0.15, 0.05, 0.02, 0.75], ""], [93271, "2020-10-17T10:06:49Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.25, 0.2, 0.5], ""], [1333, "2020-10-16T14:03:38Z", [0.0, 0.24, 0.55, 0.06, 0.15], ""], [95444, "2020-10-16T07:57:58Z", [0.0, 0.12, 0.39, 0.12, 0.37], ""], [95444, "2020-10-16T07:55:49Z", [0.0, 0.06, 0.39, 0.18, 0.37], ""], [95444, "2020-10-15T14:42:08Z", [0.0, 0.36, 0.36, 0.0, 0.28], ""], [13306, "2020-10-15T02:02:41Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.23, 0.07, 0.7], "I have re-read this Oct 3rd article and looking at the calendar, a listing \"sometime in December\" virtually rules out before 12/4.
