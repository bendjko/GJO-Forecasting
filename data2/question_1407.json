Post positions will be finalized later for the 1 1/8-mile Saudi Cup, which runs around one turn. Benbatl, 10-1 (Dubawi \u2013 Saeed bin Suroor \u2013 20: 10-3-1): This international star won Al Maktoum Challenge Round 2 (G2) with ease most recently in his dirt debut. But those Meydan prep races for the Dubai World Cup are typically filled with weaker competition or horses rounding into shape off significant layoffs. Now Benbatl steps up to face some top-quality American dirt stars. While Benbatl is a respected veteran on turf, the waters look too deep here. Toss. Capezzano, 20-1 (Bernardini \u2013 Salem Bin Ghadayer \u2013 16: 6-1-2): The same concern for Benbatl applies to Capezzano. Against weaker horses in the Firebreak Stakes (G3) at Meydan, Capezzano set the pace and rolled home to an easy win. In this spot, though, there are dirt horses in another league than the ones he defeated. Capezzano does not enjoy rating off the pace, which means he will face a stressful first half with quality speedsters in the mix up front. Toss. Chrysoberyl, 20-1 (Gold Allure \u2013 Hidetaka Otanashi \u2013 6: 6-0-0): As an American who does not closely follow Japanese racing, this one is tougher to analyze. But here is one note about Chrysoberyl\u2019s win in the Champions Cup (G1). He received an excellent ground-saving trip and found a big opening when tipped out. Even with his perfect 6-for-6 record, you can count on his competition here to be much stiffer. Toss. Gronkowski, 20-1 (Lonhro \u2013 Salem Bin Ghadayer \u2013 14: 4-3-3): When this horse initially came to Dubai in 2019, he finished fifth in Al Maktoum Challenge Round 3 (G1) before rebounding with a strong second in the Dubai World Cup (G1). This year, he ran a flat-looking third in both The Entisar and Al Maktoum Challenge Round 2 (G2). But, as with before, it\u2019s possible he only needed those races to get back into the flow of a campaign. Supporters will get a good price because of the recent losses. Live longshot. Great Scot, 50-1 (Requinto \u2013 Trainer TBA \u2013 11: 4-1-2): Most American handicappers will not recognize this horse. For what it is worth, he did take the Superior Mile (G3) at Haydock last September when in the care of Tom Dascombe. Saudi interests purchased him to run in this event, and the former trainer mentioned after the transaction that this horse improved with gelding, but would be fortunate to hit the board. He appears overmatched. Toss. Gold Dream, 20-1 (Gold Allure \u2013 Osamu Hirata \u2013 23: 9-7-2): If bettors like Chrysoberyl, they may want to consider the Champions Cup runner-up Gold Dream as well at a higher price. Again, though, stepping up from Japanese competition to this kind of international dirt race with an American presence is not easy. He also did not back up the Champions Cup effort when fourth in the Tokyo Daishoten (G1). Toss. Magic Wand, 15-1 (Galileo \u2013 Aidan O\u2019Brien \u2013 23: 3-9-2): This mare\u2019s ability to travel anywhere in the world and still run at a high level is admirable. In Magic Wand\u2019s most recent start, she ran a good second in the Pegasus World Cup Turf Invitational. Dirt is an unknown for Magic Wand, and her breeding spells grass on both sides. Toss. Maximum Security, 5/2 (New Year\u2019s Day \u2013 Jason Servis \u2013 9: 7-1-0): On paper, there is no reason to go against the top American dirt star. Last year, Maximum Security crossed the wire first in the Kentucky Derby before following up that effort with a Haskell (G1) victory in the summer. Back around one turn in the Cigar Mile (G1), he dominated older horses in December to cap off an impressive campaign. He prefers to set the pace, but sitting off other horses is not a problem and may be necessary here. The pick. McKinzie, 7/2 (Street Sense \u2013 Bob Baffert \u2013 14: 7-6-0): With 13 first or second-place finishes in 14 starts, it is hard to knock McKinzie\u2019s consistency. In his most recent start, he ran a good second to Vino Rosso in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic. The 1 1/4-mile distance proved a little too far, and now he cuts back to his favored nine furlongs. With Baffert in his corner, he also has an experienced trainer who knows how to ship to the Middle East to win. Win contender. Midnight Bisou, 8-1 (Midnight Lute \u2013 Steven Asmussen \u2013 19: 12-4-3): Knocking a mare who went 7-for-8 last year, all in graded stakes, is difficult. She ran a good second in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Distaff after a questionable ride to end her campaign. But in Midnight Bisou\u2019s 2020 debut, she tackles males for the first time, including a sharp horse in Maximum Security, McKinzie and an improving Mucho Gusto, all while facing unfamiliar territory. She runs consistently nonetheless and can hit the board. Use underneath. Mijack, 50-1 (Elzaam \u2013 Sami Alharabi \u2013 ?:?-?-?): This local contender won The Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques Cup (G1) earlier this month for horses imported to Saudi Arabia to secure his spot in the field. Race officials selected him over the winner of the other division on the same card for strictly local horses. Earlier in his career, he struggled in Europe, never amounting to more than a handicap horse. The presence of international stars will prove too much here. Toss. Mucho Gusto, 10-1 (Mucho Macho Man \u2013 Bob Baffert \u2013 11: 6-2-2): With the reduced purse, the Pegasus World Cup (G1) lacked the same punch as in previous years when City of Light, Gun Runner and Arrogate won. Mucho Gusto was hard-ridden in the stretch to beat Mr Freeze, and it will require more to beat his stablemate McKinzie, let alone Maximum Security, if those two stars transfer their form to Saudi Arabia. As with McKinzie, the big positive is that Baffert knows how to win in the Middle East. Plus, Mucho Gusto has room to improve as a 4-year-old. Win contender. North America, 30-1 (Dubawi \u2013 Satish Seemar \u2013 19: 7-3-3): Similar to Benbatl and Capezzano, this speedy 8-year-old gelding looks like the kind of horse who wins in the Middle East when there are few international shippers and the good horses present are coming off layoffs. In the Saudi Cup, every runner is likely to by at 100% for the world\u2019s largest purse. His pace-setting style will give him some problems, too, with Maximum Security and Capezzano present. Toss. Tacitus, 8-1 (Tapit \u2013 Bill Mott \u2013 9: 3-3-2): After winning the Tampa Bay Derby (G2) and Wood Memorial (G2) last spring, this once-promising colt developed second-itis with runner-up finishes in the Belmont Stakes, Jim Dandy Stakes (G2) and Travers Stakes (G1). He then finished a flat third in the Jockey Club Gold Cup (G1) to go along with his third in the Kentucky Derby, resulting in a layoff of five months entering this spot. Unless he proves otherwise, expect the same board-hitting effort at best. Use underneath. Conclusion: Maximum Security looks like the best horse in this field. However, there are a few factors working against him, including a change in environment, different medication rules and two speedballs in Capezzano and North America destined to hamper him. As the best dirt horse, however, he should be expected to overcome those factors. Those searching for value may take a shot on Gronkowski. With two starts this year in tow, fitness is not an excuse anymore. He figures to get a good trip stalking the leaders \u2014 he can run closer to the pace compared to his brief U.S. campaign \u2014 and can take advantage if the three speeds fold.    - \nhttps://www.horseracingnation.com/news/Saudi_Cup_2020_Early_odds_and_analysis_123#"], [1333, "2020-02-23T16:46:05Z", [0.04, 0.11, 0.25, 0.18, 0.17, 0.13, 0.0, 0.12], ""], [691, "2020-02-23T14:35:12Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.37, 0.33, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2], ""], [79461, "2020-02-22T20:35:38Z", [0.01, 0.09, 0.29, 0.15, 0.18, 0.01, 0.01, 0.26], "I made my first prediction before we had an exact list of the entrants, but now just 8 days out of the race we have preliminary lists coming out.

Game Winner is not currently listed on the Horseracing nation.com website as a contender in the Saudi Cup.   Starting with Maximum security, best 9 furlong race time listed is at 1:47.56 where he beat Mucho Gusto last July.  The last race in December, his pace per furlong was slightly slower despite a shorter distance (12s per furlong vice 11.8s).  Maximum security is a 4 year old Colt Midnight Bisou has a series of of wins at the 9 furlong distance, though once again there is a trend running from August through November of slightly slower times (November was 12.2 per furlong at 9 furlongs).  Most of Bisou's races appear to be at the 1 1/16 or 9 furlong distance.  Bisou is a 5 yr old Mare.   Tacitus was solid running at the 10 furlong distance in the August and September turning in 12s per furlong at the longer distance.  This would seem to bode well for the horse at a slightly shorter distance.  Tacitus is a 4 yr old Colt Mckinzie has turned in the 2 quickest 9 furlong times of the top 4 horses with a 1:46.95 and a 1:47.1   Despite some slower times later in this year, the horse seems to have quite a bit of potential.  Mckinzie is a 5 year old horse.   Last one for me is Gronk! - despite a great name the only 9 furlong time doesn't look great at 1:52.  Knocking off more than 5 second over thh training period seems like a lot, though this horse may have an advantage of having raced in the middle east for the last three events.  Furlong times for Gronk tend to run well over 12, though these are clocked mostly at 10 vice 9.  \n"], [29054, "2020-01-12T19:43:04Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.33, 0.11, 0.33, 0.0, 0.0, 0.23], ""], [1333, "2020-01-12T17:06:45Z", [0.06, 0.06, 0.32, 0.1, 0.14, 0.14, 0.06, 0.12], ""], [80617, "2020-01-12T13:19:23Z", [0.08, 0.1, 0.25, 0.16, 0.15, 0.12, 0.05, 0.09], ""], [79461, "2020-01-11T18:15:42Z", [0.05, 0.08, 0.3, 0.15, 0.15, 0.12, 0.0, 0.15], ""], [1333, "2020-01-11T14:33:10Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.35, 0.1, 0.14, 0.14, 0.05, 0.12], ""], [63786, "2020-01-10T17:45:20Z", [0.0, 0.04, 0.33, 0.25, 0.19, 0.06, 0.0, 0.13], ""], [81450, "2020-01-09T09:07:55Z", [0.03, 0.11, 0.11, 0.45, 0.05, 0.15, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2020-01-08T21:54:25Z", [0.04, 0.05, 0.37, 0.1, 0.14, 0.14, 0.04, 0.12], ""], [80425, "2020-01-06T20:25:30Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.6, 0.25, 0.15, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "Following the bookie for top three"], [80617, "2020-01-04T21:55:45Z", [0.1, 0.15, 0.25, 0.15, 0.15, 0.1, 0.05, 0.05], ""], [1333, "2020-01-04T11:31:19Z", [0.03, 0.05, 0.38, 0.1, 0.14, 0.14, 0.04, 0.12], ""], [1333, "2020-01-03T18:49:06Z", [0.03, 0.05, 0.39, 0.1, 0.14, 0.14, 0.03, 0.12], ""], [4412, "2020-01-02T19:26:00Z", [0.15, 0.25, 0.45, 0.15, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [81280, "2020-01-02T13:02:58Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.5, 0.0, 0.1, 0.1, 0.2], ""], [1333, "2020-01-02T10:38:54Z", [0.02, 0.05, 0.41, 0.1, 0.14, 0.14, 0.02, 0.12], ""], [554, "2020-01-02T06:31:38Z", [0.15, 0.15, 0.25, 0.15, 0.15, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05], ""], [44308, "2019-12-31T12:01:52Z", [0.13, 0.13, 0.13, 0.13, 0.13, 0.13, 0.13, 0.09], ""], [81244, "2019-12-30T01:29:58Z", [0.19, 0.15, 0.27, 0.25, 0.03, 0.07, 0.04, 0.0], ""], [50981, "2019-12-29T12:51:04Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.65, 0.35, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [593, "2019-12-29T12:01:38Z", [0.1, 0.1, 0.28, 0.12, 0.1, 0.12, 0.08, 0.1], ""], [49779, "2019-12-28T21:34:11Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.65, 0.15, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1], ""], [1333, "2019-12-28T17:21:53Z", [0.01, 0.05, 0.43, 0.1, 0.14, 0.14, 0.01, 0.12], " Report: Maximum Security to bypass Pegasus World Cup\n\u00bb Midnight Bisou ends 'mini-break,' working toward the Saudi Cup\n\u00bb Gronkowski 'going just right' into prep for big-money races\nhttps://www.horseracingnation.com/race/2020_Saudi_Cup#"], [1333, "2019-12-28T17:19:50Z", [0.01, 0.05, 0.43, 0.1, 0.14, 0.14, 0.05, 0.08], "Watching Musto Gusto though...\n"], [29054, "2019-12-27T23:06:51Z", [0.12, 0.0, 0.13, 0.21, 0.19, 0.14, 0.13, 0.08], ""], [60877, "2019-12-27T20:29:02Z", [0.05, 0.85, 0.05, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "Gronk hasn't played in months so he'll be well rested"], [1333, "2019-12-27T13:50:30Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.43, 0.1, 0.14, 0.09, 0.09, 0.05], ""], [1333, "2019-12-26T05:59:52Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.44, 0.1, 0.13, 0.09, 0.09, 0.05], ""], [42276, "2019-12-23T14:12:50Z", [0.15, 0.1, 0.15, 0.15, 0.15, 0.15, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [21884, "2019-12-20T09:21:37Z", [0.08, 0.08, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.08, 0.0, 0.16], ""], [1333, "2019-12-20T07:52:24Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.45, 0.1, 0.12, 0.09, 0.09, 0.05], ""], [35766, "2019-12-18T22:11:46Z", [0.02, 0.1, 0.45, 0.2, 0.2, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01], ""], [1333, "2019-12-18T19:40:51Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.46, 0.1, 0.11, 0.09, 0.09, 0.05], ""], [1333, "2019-12-16T19:36:53Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.47, 0.1, 0.1, 0.09, 0.09, 0.05], ""], [691, "2019-12-16T14:35:59Z", [0.18, 0.19, 0.19, 0.18, 0.19, 0.02, 0.0, 0.05], ""], [18679, "2019-12-16T07:59:26Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.55, 0.0, 0.45, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [79461, "2019-12-14T01:35:29Z", [0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.15, 0.1, 0.1, 0.0, 0.2], ""], [32300, "2019-12-13T18:09:53Z", [0.08, 0.18, 0.12, 0.2, 0.15, 0.08, 0.0, 0.19], ""], [1333, "2019-12-13T15:14:49Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.48, 0.1, 0.09, 0.09, 0.09, 0.05], ""], [56, "2019-12-13T12:48:58Z", [0.15, 0.25, 0.12, 0.23, 0.18, 0.05, 0.0, 0.02], "Thunder Snow has retired from racing.[1] Gronkowski came in second to Thunder Snow in the Dubai World Cup, last year.[2] McKinzie is the 5/1 favorite at the Dubai World Cup.[3] Midnight Bisou and Maximum Security are each contenders with 9/1 and 10/1 odds in the Dubai World Cup, respectively.
