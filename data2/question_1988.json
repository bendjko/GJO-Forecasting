There are probably enough votes in the Assembly to impeach him, but they'll need some pretend deliberations as they prepare to file, docket, and vote on the articles.   The Honourable Members will have to fit this carnival in with other legislative business and also take the usual long and frequent breaks from their exertions.   Once they get him impeached, maybe not before October or so, the matter goes over to the Court for the Trial of Impeachments, which is the State Senate (minus the President Pro Tem, who is in the succession and so presumptively interested), augmented by the judges of the Court of Appeals (the state's Supreme Court). Two thirds of this gang must vote to convict.   As it happens, exactly two thirds of the current Senate are Ds, and all of the Court of Appeals judges (who serve 14-year terms) are Cuomo appointees.   They will wish to  distinguish their procedures from those of the President-Eject's sock puppets, so they will take their time pretending to decide what to do. Meanwhile, young Andrew will pull out all the stops to cajole, threaten, or suborn some of the Senate Ds into either voting for acquittal or going to visit a sick aunt on the day of the vote.  But after impeachment, the Lieutenant Governor becomes Acting Governor until the impeachment is resolved or the Governor's term expires; this may decrease Handy Andy's influence at that point in the festivities. LG Kathy Hochul is generally better liked than Cuomo, as is most of humanity, and is regarded as very smart, very tough, quite a good campaigner, and shall we say flexible in policy matters.   She immediately becomes the front-runner to succeed him if he is gone for the '22 election.   There is no imaginable Republican candidate who can be elected Governor of New York in the foreseeable future, although some other offices might be secured by comparatively attractive R candidates.  Therefore, if were the New York Republicans, I'd have to decide whether the down-ticket is better served by having Kathy Hochul automatically at the head of the D ticket, with a fairly distinguished record even before acquiring gubernatorial experience as Regent, or Hochul or another D going through a bruising primary campaign if Merry Andrew decides to run again, as he might well?  If the latter, I might vote not to convict him in the Senate.   I still wouldn't take the Mansion, but I could get the opposition to start eating their young and build up my farm team.  The punch line, if there is one, is that it is improbable that this will all play out before next April.

Delaying has worked well for Cuomo in the past, including this year when he refused to resign in March and his poll numbers gradually went back up due to his Covid response and the passage of time.

President Biden has said Cuomo should resign, but he has also said he's not calling Cuomo on the phone to tell him to resign: https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-cuomo-call-sexual-harassment-impeachment-resignation-psaki It's best for Democrats politically if they can loudly condemn Cuomo, but then he just quietly serves out his term and goes quietly into the night. From a cold, calculating perspective that someone like Cuomo uses, it's best to stay in office as long as possible, with the criminal investigations ongoing. If he were to resign he would be giving away a lot of his bargaining chips. I can't see what he'd gain from resigning, unless it's as part of a deal to avoid prosecution. Announcing he won't seek reelection --  This seems a given, due to the polling: http://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Marist-Poll_NYS-NOS-and-Tables_202108040647-2.pdf#page=3  Please see page 6 -- only 18% of Democrats think he should be reelected.
