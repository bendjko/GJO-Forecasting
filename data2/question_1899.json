(https://www.politico.eu/article/us-and-russia-poised-to-extend-new-start-treaty/) - According to armscontrol.org article from November 2020, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has said that if he is elected president in November, he will pursue the treaty\u2019s extension without conditions.  The same article explains the Trump Administrations thoughts:  \u201cthe New START Treaty by itself is not a good deal for the United States or our friends or allies,\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters Oct. 21. He criticized the treaty for failing to capture Russia\u2019s large and, according to the Defense Department, growing arsenal of up to 2,000 nonstrategic nuclear warheads.  (https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2020-11/news/new-start-limbo-ahead-us-election).  Therefore, it seems there is a almost no chance the Trump Administration will sign the treaty before January 20, 2021. - This is in line with an article by the Russian news agency, TASS, which indicates the Russian government expects the new US administration to make the final determination.  That allows only 16 days for the Biden Administration to put a deal together. If the treaty is not signed:\n1) Any previously-acquired transparency between nations would be lost (Advantage Russia, since the US has previously accused Russia of sidestepping verification mechanisms)\n2) The U.S. could increase the number of warheads allocated to each missile and bomber (no advantage).\n3) Either side could purchase more launchers in order to reach the desired total number of warheads.  This would be the most expensive option for both nations and it seems unlikely either side would do this, since a new treaty would probably require them to be dismantled.  The Biden Administration is going to have enough work to do in the first month after taking control.  I just don't see this happening, so I will start this at 50% and keep an eye on the news after his team takes office."], [22689, "2021-01-10T22:13:16Z", [1.0], ""], [96739, "2021-01-10T21:38:43Z", [0.99], "99% yes it will be extended.

His announcement came after the revelation that Russia is likely the culprit in the Solar Winds cyber attack. If such an attack does not deter the new administration from supporting extension of the treaty, it is hard to imagine other actions Russia might take that would change the U.S. administration's calculus on this question. The Biden administration sees the extension as a much-needed framework for stability.   New START extension doesn\u2019t require Congressional legislation or Senate ratification, meaning the executive can make this decision unilaterally. On December 17, 2020 President Putin called on the U.S. to extend the treaty. The interests of both parties are aligned to extend the treaty. Though there is limited time between inauguration day and February 5, this is clearly a priority for the new administration.
