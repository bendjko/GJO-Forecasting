Travelport LLC\u2019s sizable distressed debt exchange (DDE) along with J Jill Group\u2019s restructuring and filings from Chief Power LLC and FTS International Inc. are names to watch. The default pace has certainly slowed from the $9.6 billion monthly average occurring over April through July, but activity is expected to remain elevated throughout the year and into 2021. In March, Fitch projected a two-year cumulative base case default of about 15% by YE 2021, with 5%\u20136% forecast for YE 2020.

Mnuchin (SOT) could end soon.\nb/ or the market starts pricing in the conversion of the once economic crisis triggered by the pandemic into a financial crisis, in which the financial sector will lose the ability to generate fees on diverse business field while at the same time market volatility (FX, rates, equities) and asset devaluation could cause write-offs and p&l losses exceeding the stress scenarios tested by the FED, and causing yet another case \"Lehman Bros.\", where liabilities will exceed assets and insolvency may be become inevitable.\nc/ the current market condition on core mobility and industrial markets make a big default of a very large company more probable, the longer they last:\nVulnerable companies are:\nGE\nBoeing\nfor several strategic reasons and in both cases for reasons of bad investment decisions and prolonged mismanagement.\nGE is currently missing the business with aircraft turbines, and has to wind down its business with coal-fired power plants sooner or later causing write-offs of 8bn USD or more.\nBoeing will lose some 25bn USD on the 737 MAX-8 grounding by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and a reputational damage that is hard to put into figures. Procedures within Boeing have obviously deteriorated quality under the protectionist fostering by the FAA, which has now been forced to wake up and put Boeing under more scrutiny. Their other flagship product Dreamliner is now in trouble for having construction and manufacturing  deficiencies that Boeing knew about but ignored, and that the FAA obviously did not want to find checking... Hard to imagine, that either GE or Boeing went bankrupt; on the other hand, they are so deep in the \"spiral of death\" of bad management, lack of strategy, bad luck in trouble and maybe even problems funding on the bond/leveraged loan markets that they or at least one of them might just collapse if the markets acknowledge the full risk. Either of them would then be large enough to shake all markets and maybe even cause another financial crisis, since each of them has probably a double to triple digit figure of billions USD debt notional outstanding.

I'd guess the climb in leverage loan default will be slower than we saw in 2008 and 2009 for this reason, and it's possible (if the government continues to play an effective role) that these default rates don't exceed 6%.

The stock loses 8,3% at the moment.

Another big fish company to watch closely is Dominion Energy (61.7bn USD market cap): the stock was very volatile in February and March 2020, however, the company looks pretty solid; but even Enron looked pretty solid for most of the time.

It's really tempting to substitute the question asked for the much easier \"Is the credit market in dire straits right now?\" I don't think it takes a veteran bond trader to know that many companies are tetering on the brink of collapse. Default rates are through the roof: 33% in the oil and gas sector and 172% ahead of pace overall based on data from the previous period. [1] But despite these scary numbers, there doesn't seem to be an obvious linear relationship in default rates. In fact, it seems to be the exact opposite in some cases. According to a Thomson Reuters analysis of data published tby the credit rating agency Fitch, the default rate declined in the first three months of the year before skyrocketing in April and May. [2] Most experts seem to be committed to an end of year date for topping that historical benchmark of 6 percent but this doesn't help us much except for perhaps assigning less weight to the probability of not before the new year. [3] If we take the month-on-month April to May change in the rate of +0.29% that puts us at 4.45% Leveraged Default Rate (LDR) by the end of the year. Based on the lack of any linear relationship, I don't put much stock in this number. Especially so with WSJ reporting that bankruptcies were up 48 percent in May, a significant number it has be said but also one that may not move the needle as much as first thought. [4] With all this conflicting evidence in mind, my thinking is that we probably won't see 6 percent before July or August, the rate may even back off slightly. But we will probably see it before the January deadline. I'll be watching this one closely. Comments would be extremely helpful.

I don't know anything about this market, so I'll start by warning you to be prepared for a naive view that you should probably ignore.  Currently the US Leveraged Loan Default Rate is 3.1%. Over the last couple of years it's been been mostly in the 0.9 to 2.1% range. During that time it's fluctuated, but has clearly reacted to the COVID outbreak. Since March it's gone up from about 1.8 to 3.1%. Currently it is edging downward slightly. It's a long way to reach 6%. There are several trends going on: \n1) after a massive wave of credit downgrades in April and May, the trend seems to have reversed to a much less horrible rate (but still 3-4x more horrible than pre-COVID)\n2) There is a surge in covenant modifications and waivers which could be a sign that the market is seeking to work with lenders and avoid defaults ... or it could simply be a first step towards a wave of defaults.\n3) leveraged loans are selling below par in all categories, indicating that the market sees a lot of risk and expects further modifications or defaults\n4) the Fed is working hard to back the market and avoid defaults\n5) regardless, the new normal isn't working for a lot of companies, and the wave of defaults isn't over, especially in oil & gas, hospitality and retail.\n6) if the number of new issuances continues at its current very high pace, that's going to increase the denominator and limit the upward trend of this metric Good news: As pointed out below, the default rate is calculated on a TTM basis, so it's going to take high numbers sustained over months to push it over 6%. The other good news is that because of this calculation method it should be easier to predict than monthly numbers.  Clearly it's going to go up. I've modeled a range of scenarios that seem reasonable (but which are horribly naive and uniformed) and I get something between November and some time in 2021 to hit the 6% mark.

EDIT: The June 2020 Index on the S&P Global pages has not moved and is calculated as 2.94% as of now.\nSo either there has been no kind of debt involved in the Chesapeake default that is classified as \"leveraged loan\", or a) the 12-m moving sum (and thus the index) is not calculated on a daily basis but at month end, and has not been confirmed as of 30 June 2020, or will be fixed within the next few days."], [79590, "2020-06-29T17:00:41Z", [0.15, 0.2, 0.15, 0.5], ""], [93033, "2020-06-29T15:29:02Z", [0.05, 0.15, 0.25, 0.55], ""], [691, "2020-06-29T14:36:57Z", [0.08, 0.5, 0.36, 0.06], ""], [1333, "2020-06-29T14:30:22Z", [0.55, 0.35, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [90447, "2020-06-29T13:42:47Z", [0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0], ""], [91142, "2020-06-29T02:38:26Z", [0.05, 0.1, 0.3, 0.55], "Starting point forecast.

On this calculation it depends, whether there a two possible outcomes per basket, or rather roughly 43 business days over the period, where the threshold can be hit. I think it's the latter.\n- The 12m-moving sum is then put into relation to the total debt on this specific debt market outstanding, so a percentage index is received.\n- The latest large-scale default event of Hertz combined different loans of a total of 10.54 bn USD outstanding, which drive the 12m-moving sum to 37.4 bn USD as of 26 May 2020.\n- The total market has been \"nearly 1.2 trillion USD\" or rather 1,191.1 bn USD, which can be inferred from the latest default ratio of 3.14% - The major share of the market has become \"covenant-lite\" debt which stands for 80% or ~ 958.9 bn USD and which are unlikely to default in a first wave soon.\nOn the flipside, 20% of the market or a total notional of 238.2 bn USD has tough covenants which means that certain trigger events will cause a loan to default (technically or by payment outstanding) very mechanically or automatically without much room for maneuver or negotiations. These 20% of debt outstanding are likely to default first, as they are likely floated/issued by companies which have already had a distress/restructuring, an overload of debt or vulnerabilities.\n- In the Hertz example, the stock Hertz Global Holdings (HTZ) has been in trouble from 21 February 2020, but from the chart it seems clear that already on 26 March 2020 a default was inevitable, since no government money promised could turn around the share price, and equity holders are eradicated first in case of a bankruptcy. So stock prices may be a good lead indicator of up to two months for an expected default.\n- The previous 11 months period also charted in the article from May 2019 to March 2020 (of which only June 2019 and the following feed into the index as of May) seem to be chicken feed compared to what has begun in April 2020 (~7bn USD in defaults) and May 2020, and to what will be coming.\n- The total market of leveraged loans will stagnate right now, since risks are obvious, and lenders will not be willing to put their notional at risk at a still relatively low risk premium (\"interest rate\"), unless interest rates in this segment are significantly rising. With every single debt which is now amortized successfully, the total market and thus the base for our index will be shrinking, so our index has a natural skew towards increasing.\n- At the market volume as of 27 May 2020 (the date of the Hertz article), it requires a total notional of 71.5bn USD to surpass the watershed of 6.00% in the index, which leaves a sum of ~ 34.1bn USD for the next few months.\n- In a conclusion, it requires a default of three to four issuers of the size of Hertz to meet the prerequisites of the question to be answered \"YES\". As the stock index S&P 500 contains roughly 500 constituents, only 0.6% to 0.8% of all companies listed there need to default to surpass 71.5bn USD with 95% certainty, which is a value not too far from a normal rate, if you think of companies which have strategic problems like Macy's or Toys'r'us earlier and the Schumpeter model of \"Sch\u00f6pferische Zerst\u00f6rung\" (creative destruction/disruption), which is a driving force in many industries and markets anyway even without the pandemic. When will it happen? I guess it is up to us to follow the news flow on major bankruptcies, and maybe the question should have been listed as a companion question to this one here https://www.gjopen.com/questions/1622-between-15-may-2020-and-30-november-2020-will-any-group-iii-u-s-air-carrier-file-for-bankruptcy EDIT: while bankruptcies can of course happen every business day, the outcome of this question will be determined on a monthly or on a month-to date (?) basis. The fact that the index has fallen from 3.14% (May 2020) to 2.94% (as of 26 June 2020) is obviously due to the fact that a ~4bn amount of defaulted notional in June 2019 will no longer flow into the 12m-moving sum, the residue to reach 6.00% must thus lie at 38 to 39bn USD as of today. Candidates for default according to size and stock performance (not knowing whether they are active in the leveraged loan market segment): Carnival Corp.\nNorwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\nUnder Armour Inc.\nUnited Airlines Holdings Inc.\nAmerican Airlines Group Inc.\nRoyal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.\nMarathon Oil Corp.\nKohl's Corp.\nNoble Energy Inc.

EDIT2: I need to step back a little from my assumption of a \"shrinking market\", as obviously the FED as a lender/buyer of last resort might come into play, as you can read from other S&P articles; at least on the \"high yield issuance\" side, to which the leveraged loans may add, the FEDs assurance to buy corporate bonds from \"fallen angels\" of the pandemic in their 9 April 2020 FED bond bulletin seems to have spurred a real bonanza in the new issuance in June 2020. https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/leveraged-loan-news/us-high-yield-bond-market-eyes-record-june-as-fed-fueled-debt-issuance-rolls-on https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/leveraged-loan-news/fed-rally-default-fears-bring-bifurcation-back-to-leveraged-loans"], [84880, "2020-06-27T06:46:56Z", [0.33, 0.51, 0.11, 0.05], ""], [90653, "2020-06-27T03:40:30Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.74, 0.26], ""], [18318, "2020-06-26T23:35:10Z", [0.15, 0.25, 0.25, 0.35], ""], [88766, "2020-06-26T23:32:45Z", [0.33, 0.67, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [86678, "2020-06-26T22:02:24Z", [0.77, 0.13, 0.09, 0.01], ""], [31275, "2020-06-26T20:17:40Z", [0.18, 0.26, 0.41, 0.15], "https://www.forbes.com/sites/mayrarodriguezvalladares/2020/06/20/corporate-defaults-this-year-are-likely-to-surpass-the-mountain-of-great-recession-defaults/"], [1333, "2020-06-26T18:26:29Z", [0.74, 0.16, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [52854, "2020-06-26T18:24:08Z", [0.0, 0.85, 0.07, 0.08], ""], [88452, "2020-06-26T17:54:55Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2020-06-26T17:33:51Z", [0.75, 0.15, 0.1, 0.0], ""]]}
