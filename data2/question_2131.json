Additionally, the UAE is celebrating its Golden Jubilee, which is running from 6 April 2021 to 31 March 2022, and consists of multiple events that are attracting visitors and is expected to attract additional visitors [5]. Further, Britain has relaxed travel restrictions to the UAE and travel between the two countries is expected to increase [6]. Finally, the Dubai airport expects to see a spike in visitors in 2022 due to travel restrictions being lifted between the UK, US, and Saudi Arabia, with 27 million travelers already passing through the airport in 2021 [7]. Obviously, this projection will need to be monitored as the event progresses, but, I assess with a 65% probability that the UAE will be able to attract 25 million visits due to the relaxation of COVID safety protocols, reduction in price for Expo tickets, and increased travel to the UAE.
