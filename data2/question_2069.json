I'm therefore still leaning slightly towards VER becoming champion.  But wow, have the probability margins narrowed again just because of this race! Looking back at my previous forecasts, I don't think my probabilities were out of line with what was seen at the time. It just seems that one of the much less likely outcomes in my scenario range has now expressed: a late, very significant change in relative performance in the Mercedes cars vs RBR that matters over a race distance. Although my running probabilistic analysis of historical outcomes this season (described at https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1342535) still suggests that VER chances of winning the championship are ~77% post-Brazil, I think it's quite appropriate/necessary to make a forecast that significantly deviates away from such full-season base rate reference points. The new evidence from today's full-length race--although quite surprising to me--is impressive and compelling.  It appears that in the final races of this amazing season, we'll see how tough VER and the RBR team really are. It is always foolish to count HAM out completely, but the same should be said for VER as well! It's not a given that the technological performance edge that Mercedes have apparently now created for themselves can be converted into the wins necessary, if the team drops the ball on strategy, pit work, or driver errors under pressure (that last one's admittedly a very tiny chance, but the first two should be of real concern to Mercedes, in my opinion, based on their increased frequency of questionable strategy calls and errors vs in the past when they were not really under threat by any other teams).

Posterior a esto sali\u00f3 Red Bull a contrarrestar la ventaja ya que seg\u00fan ellos esto les juega en contra al final de la carrera. As\u00ed mismo se pueden pasar toda la temporada un equipo peleando con el otro por lo tanto la comparaci\u00f3n la voy a hacer con los segundos pilotos de cada equipo para ver como les ha ido, mirando los resultados de Sergio P\u00e9rez (Red Bull) y Valteri Bottas (Mercedes) se ve que tampoco son mucho las diferencias, Bottas va en tercer lugar y P\u00e9rez en quinto lugar lo que demuestra que los autos son muy parecidos, adem\u00e1s considerando que P\u00e9rez a cometido un par de errores en la pista. Dicho esto, podemos decir que con respecto a los autos no hay diferencias notorias.\nEn segundo lugar, el manejo de los pilotos es complicado de criticar ya que se ven muy influenciados por el jefe del equipo y la estrategia que se les plantea, muchas veces cometen errores pero es debido a que est\u00e1n siendo presionados desde los boxes. Para comparar esto utilizaremos la \u00fanica carrera del a\u00f1o con lluvia ya que es en ese minuto donde la sensibilidad del piloto se expresa al m\u00e1ximo, es mas, dicen que es aqu\u00ed donde se va la diferencia entre pilotos y maestros. En el circuito de Spa-Francorchamps la lluvia fue torrencial y pese a que no se pudo terminar la carrera, de hecho se corrieron pocas vueltas, quedo Verstappen primero y Hamilton tercero, adem\u00e1s es importante considerar que Verstappen viene conduciendo muy bien en lluvia hace un par de a\u00f1os.\nPara terminar, sin lugar a dudad va a ser una pelea muy re\u00f1ida de aqu\u00ed a final de temporada entre estos dos pilotos pero por un mejor manejo de Verstappen, en mi opini\u00f3n, puede sacar ventajas este a\u00f1o y ser campe\u00f3n."], [691, "2021-09-09T19:54:53Z", [0.4, 0.0, 0.6, 0.0], ""], [20156, "2021-09-09T09:39:20Z", [0.47, 0.0, 0.53, 0.0], ""], [101989, "2021-09-08T12:01:13Z", [0.45, 0.0, 0.55, 0.0], ""], [94563, "2021-09-08T10:23:47Z", [0.42, 0.0, 0.58, 0.0], ""], [100653, "2021-09-08T07:00:52Z", [0.4, 0.0, 0.57, 0.03], ""], [95992, "2021-09-08T01:46:47Z", [0.4, 0.0, 0.6, 0.0], ""], [101542, "2021-09-07T17:46:03Z", [0.41, 0.0, 0.59, 0.0], ""], [102456, "2021-09-07T15:20:53Z", [0.34, 0.0, 0.56, 0.1], ""], [100653, "2021-09-07T07:28:54Z", [0.4, 0.0, 0.56, 0.04], ""], [102463, "2021-09-07T04:33:42Z", [0.31, 0.07, 0.54, 0.08], ""], [100653, "2021-09-06T15:41:20Z", [0.4, 0.0, 0.54, 0.06], ""], [34959, "2021-09-06T15:10:10Z", [0.41, 0.0, 0.59, 0.0], ""], [102011, "2021-09-06T03:39:18Z", [0.45, 0.0, 0.55, 0.0], "Max hits the lead but 9 races to go, very tight with some races favourly Lewis to come up"], [90882, "2021-09-05T22:09:11Z", [0.38, 0.0, 0.62, 0.0], ""], [100115, "2021-09-05T21:10:49Z", [0.49, 0.0, 0.51, 0.0], ""], [62808, "2021-09-05T21:07:35Z", [0.3, 0.0, 0.7, 0.0], ""], [89038, "2021-09-05T18:41:27Z", [0.43, 0.0, 0.57, 0.0], ""], [85111, "2021-09-05T18:36:53Z", [0.35, 0.0, 0.65, 0.0], "Verstappen has a slim lead but more importantly the Red Bull has been shown to be the faster car over the course of the year.

There is no way that Red Bull would let Perez take the championship unless Verstappen can't finish the season. And I doubt that Perez could outdrive Hamilton, who is deeply motivated to win his record-breaking eighth world championship. Despite the surprising Silverstone result, Verstappen has a clear edge. The Red Bull team seems once again to have Adrian Newey's full attention on aerodynamics, and their Honda engine has finally equalled, or even surpassed, the mighty Mercedes motor. Red Bull excels in pit stops, whereas Mercedes and Toto Wolff have been uncharacteristically weak on both tactical and strategic execution. Things to watch: Hamilton's renewed confidence and commitment after his strong British Grand Prix outcome can still make a difference. Verstappen's high-speed crash may have lingering effects that will take time to manifest. Mercedes may make greater-than-expected engineering strides during the summer break. The first two factors could be apparent during the upcoming Hungarian Grand Prix; the third won't be evident until at least September. If Hamilton manages to hold his own or even pull ahead in the championship by the end of September, game on. Otherwise, I'll be steadily increasing my odds for Verstappen."], [100653, "2021-07-19T16:34:02Z", [0.36, 0.0, 0.64, 0.0], ""], [101420, "2021-07-19T15:20:31Z", [0.2, 0.1, 0.1, 0.6], ""], [101286, "2021-07-19T12:49:47Z", [0.55, 0.0, 0.45, 0.0], "Being a moderate F1 fan, I have a bit of knowledge coming into this question.  First, I have no doubt that either Lewis Hamilton or Max Verstappen will be the champion come the end of the season.  They have won 9/10 races so far this season, and have a points lead over third that equates to more than 2 victories (meaning third place would need to win twice while Hamilton and Verstappen collect 0 points).  Even if that were to happen, third place would still be behind and would have to outperform Hamilton and Verstappen in the final third of the season.  Looking at Hamilton vs Verstappen is much more interesting, though.  Lewis Hamilton, currently in second place, is 8 points behind Verstappen.  However, Hamilton has won 6 of the last 7 World Drivers' Championships (85%), while Verstappen has never won.  With 13 races left in the season, both racers are more than capable of being on top at the end.  However, I've picked Hamilton to win for a few reasons.  First, an 8 point lead is incredibly slim (can easily be made up in one race given these racers win nearly every single race).  Second, Hamilton won 9 of the final 13 races last season, while Verstappen only won 1.  Were this to happen again, Hamilton would run away with the Championship.  Finally, Hamilton is undoubtedly the greatest F1 driver of all time, with championship experience.  All of these things give him an edge over Verstappen.  However, I did check Draftkings for betting odds, and Max Verstappen is actually the odds-on favorite to win the Championship (-190 vs Hamilton at +150).  Removing the Vig from these odds, this makes Hamilton a slight underdog.  Based on all these factors, I've decided to give Hamilton a slight edge at the moment, and will adjust based on following race results."], [96828, "2021-07-19T10:33:45Z", [0.32, 0.16, 0.26, 0.26], ""], [79508, "2021-07-19T07:44:05Z", [0.24, 0.01, 0.74, 0.01], ""], [97742, "2021-07-19T07:42:18Z", [0.55, 0.05, 0.35, 0.05], ""], [101422, "2021-07-19T06:44:07Z", [0.22, 0.07, 0.71, 0.0], ""], [34815, "2021-07-19T03:49:13Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [101970, "2021-07-18T20:27:08Z", [0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0], ""], [14266, "2021-07-18T17:25:12Z", [0.37, 0.0, 0.63, 0.0], ""], [89038, "2021-07-18T17:24:25Z", [0.24, 0.01, 0.75, 0.0], ""], [79142, "2021-07-18T17:19:28Z", [0.38, 0.01, 0.6, 0.01], ""], [100608, "2021-07-18T16:18:29Z", [0.31, 0.0, 0.69, 0.0], "Small adjustment down after the British GP.
