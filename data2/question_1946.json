I summarize briefly the types of questions/concerns that each judge had below, along with a probability of ruling against the NCAA for someone who spoke like that (ignoring the judge\u2019s actual history, I already assessed outside rates previously). I think the main takeaway is that Sotomayor, Kagan, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh are pretty sure yeses, and all of the other judges have at least a decent chance of joining them, especially Alito and Thomas. Barrett\u2019s tough to judge, and Roberts and Breyer seem legitimately torn over implications for future pro-competitive joint ventures, while the rest are more focused on this case.  Roberts: 55% - it\u2019d be odd to strike this down in favor of quick look, and there are payments made to players already. This individual rule being struck is modest but the principle isn\u2019t, this may set precedent that the court can substitute its own view for the business judgments of a joint venture that\u2019s been upheld as pro-competitive, and judges aren\u2019t necessarily good for that. There\u2019s also the concern about each individual rule being struck until the NCAA collapses like a Jenga tower.\nThomas: 85% - How do we preserve amateurism without constant litigation, what would the future challenges look like? How do we preempt them in considering this case? His tone was also pretty suggestive as a side note, like \u201chow do we resolve that part of future problems that I see down the road.\u201d\nBreyer: 40% - Courts aren\u2019t a good vessel for assessing LRAs for a joint venture when there\u2019s a non-economic objective, it\u2019s hard to account for administrative issues and to assess each mini-rule against consumer demand, and saying courts can determine that can be harmful to joint ventures in the future. Can avoid that by granting quick look, but that would be concerning for future economic joint ventures. \nAlito: 80% They are paid already, so it\u2019s hard to justify a rule like this, but what\u2019s the outer limit of what would be allowed by affirming this case? \nSotomayor: 93% The injunction guards against your parade of horribles, and a narrow ruling is all that\u2019s being requested here, so broader questions aren\u2019t what\u2019s being directly asked. Roberts\u2019s Jenga argument is worrying though. \nKagan: 90% - Can\u2019t lean on the history forever, and the lower court\u2019s analysis was that consumers didn\u2019t care about this issue. Question is how do we not open the floodgates, and how do we make sure we aren\u2019t price-administering per the arbitrary-seeming $5980 limit. She also denied a stay of the ban from the lower court. \nGorsuch: 95% - Light scrutiny is usually given to joint ventures in a competitive market, but NCAA is the market, the monopsony justifies the increased scrutiny given. \nKavanaugh: 95% - Qualitatively this is bad, its exploitative and the justification is disproven and outdated and disturbing. Need to find out what the end game is based on the ruling the court will give. \nBarrett: 50% - Hard to tell if she was asking leading questions or not. Concerned about women in sports, asked about who gets to define amateurism which is at the heart of the NCAA\u2019s argument against the survey evidence, and seemed to suggest the cross-market balancing is distorting the court\u2019s discussion.

From the outside view, as @Jibreel_PCV has explained well, is pretty dismal, the Court rules against 9th circuit rulings quite often, and rulings in favor of antitrust defendants have been much more common in the past few decades (https://www.clearygottlieb.com/-/media/organize-archive/cgsh/files/publication-pdfs/antitrust-decisions-of-the-us-supreme-court.pdf). Outside rate would be something like 10-15% for this case.  Even anchored on that as the base rate, I still put a pretty high probability on the Court ruling against the NCAA, largely due to the facts of the case and recent trends in Supreme Court jurisprudence in antitrust cases. Firstly, the court denied a request to stay the ruling against the NCAA, though the denial was done by Kagan who skews liberal. They also denied cert to and effectively upheld a similar previous case from 2015 (O'Bannon vs. NCAA) regarding athletes' NIL rights. While it\u2019s possible that the Court would've denied cert to this case if they supported the plaintiff in the same way they did O'Bannon (and granting cert indicates intention to rule differently), I think that their history with O'Bannon bodes well for this case.  The most important thing to consider is trends in Supreme Court antitrust jurisprudence. The most helpful article in this regard is from the law firm Ropes and Gray (https://www.ropesgray.com/-/media/Files/articles/2014/July/Summer14-PopofskyC.pdf?la=en&hash=3B6CDB12F8F459A9EFCEEB08BC76A4E4C79E5008), though it is from 2014. The first trend is the court's movement away from specialized antitrust rules and taking nuanced views of antitrust exceptions, usually in favor of Rule of Reason analyses. As background, certain practices like price fixing are explicitly illegal per antitrust statutes, however, a court can allow the practice if it is situationally procompetitive and not overly restrictive. The Rule of Reason is a specific test that the court can use to see if an action is procompetitive and should be allowed. The NCAA openly engages in horizontal price fixing via compensation caps, but they argue that it is pro-competitive because lack of compensation (and students competing for love of the game) is necessary to differentiate college sports from pro sports. Having two different categories increases consumer choice and promotes competition. Alston is arguing that capping education-related compensation is overly restrictive, and it doesn\u2019t help differentiate college sports from pro sports. The Court moving away from specialized treatment of exceptions is obviously very important in this case, as the NCAA is leaning on the presumption that NCAA rules preserving amateurism are permissible under antitrust law, as written in the Court's decision in NCAA vs. Board of Regents of University of Oklahoma. A movement away from that type of thinking and towards an explicit preference by the Court for applying the Rule of Reason to each case that comes before the court would make this case far riskier for the NCAA. Most of that risk in this case is because NCAA's evidence used in their Rule of Reason argument is frankly pretty bad, and Alston's distinctly better. The details from the appeals court's decision is here on page 39 (https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20A24/149461/20200805105637321_Attachment%201%20-%20Alston-Ninth%20Circuit%20merits%20opinion%205-18-2020.pdf). Arguing that education-related benefits caps aren't justified or necessary for preserving demand for college sports isn't a big jump, and the evidence presented by Alston in this case was persuasive, while the NCAA's was quite weak. The NCAA's arguments for their caps are usually to the effect of \"we need to prevent unlimited pay, akin to sports salaries\", which is quite a leap from the education-related caps being argued which can't even be paid in cash. The last significant change is a willingness by the Court to allow unsettled issues in applying the rule of reason to percolate down to the lower courts. The case against the NCAA sounds quite strong, and a willingness to let unsettled issues percolate down in this case may indicate a willingness by the court to issue a ruling on this case to set the precedent that NCAA rules are subject to the Rule of Reason and get rid of the sentiment expressed back in Regents, and then let future decisions be decided by lower courts within that framework.  There are a few points of uncertainty here though. The first is that there are 3 fairly new judges on the bench, all appointed after the mentioned article, so there's no guarantee that the changes in jurisprudence will continue. Antitrust cases, especially ones relevant here, aren't super common, so the new justices' opinions are hard to gauge. Secondly, a lot of the details of this case are being read through documents produced by the lower courts that issued rulings against the NCAA, meaning there's likely a bias in most of the information that's presented about the case and the relevant legal issues. The evidence presented in the appeals court document cited before is structured around the ruling that was eventually issued, specifically including information that explained the final decision, so it's possible that some information was left out or presented in a skewed way. Thirdly, I'm not a lawyer or law student. I'm more vulnerable to unrecognized biases in what I read, and I don't know what I don't know about this case. The court may have options for treating this case that I don't know exist that I'm not factoring into my Yes probability. Overall, abysmal outside rate, but quite a compelling yes case based on details of the case, though uncertainty remains.
