Still on a gentle decline, and what goes down must go up again before reaching 100k/week. The last time the 7-day average was that high was June 12. Nearly all of the states with the most cases still have Rt < 0. Looking increasingly unlikely that we will see a 7-day average of 14.3k/day 15 days from now on July 3. Zero chance of lower categories, though, because Delta is rising in prevalence fast and will push Rt up.\nFor news before it's news (i.e., cases and deaths before the end of the day; BNO Newsdesk has been a great source of news throughout the pandemic): https://twitter.com/BNODesk/status/1406039448131866627"], [95992, "2021-06-18T20:48:55Z", [0.0, 0.03, 0.5, 0.42, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2021-06-18T18:12:06Z", [0.0, 0.02, 0.56, 0.42, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [87827, "2021-06-18T11:10:25Z", [0.04, 0.35, 0.34, 0.15, 0.08, 0.03, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [95503, "2021-06-18T09:09:58Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.57, 0.36, 0.02, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [79069, "2021-06-18T07:49:17Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [86554, "2021-06-18T07:06:34Z", [0.0, 0.08, 0.72, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [86554, "2021-06-18T07:05:43Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.72, 0.23, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [14027, "2021-06-18T05:53:40Z", [0.0, 0.57, 0.41, 0.02, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [81061, "2021-06-18T05:09:36Z", [0.0, 0.6, 0.4, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [94872, "2021-06-18T04:42:15Z", [0.0, 0.12, 0.53, 0.3, 0.04, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [99943, "2021-06-18T04:21:22Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.55, 0.45, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [96828, "2021-06-18T03:43:25Z", [0.02, 0.27, 0.4, 0.3, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [88098, "2021-06-18T02:27:33Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.67, 0.17, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [80790, "2021-06-17T20:49:18Z", [0.04, 0.34, 0.59, 0.03, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "Current rate =13.5k per day = 94k\nRate dropping at 10pc per week so over 2 weeks gets to 10.9k per day = 76k\nRange between the 2 and possibility of a quicker drop."], [691, "2021-06-17T19:25:56Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.58, 0.42, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [86554, "2021-06-17T18:40:04Z", [0.0, 0.03, 0.66, 0.3, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [95992, "2021-06-17T17:40:02Z", [0.0, 0.03, 0.44, 0.43, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [14027, "2021-06-17T16:28:40Z", [0.0, 0.37, 0.56, 0.07, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [55987, "2021-06-17T15:02:57Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.55, 0.44, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [95503, "2021-06-17T14:54:37Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.51, 0.41, 0.03, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [79069, "2021-06-17T06:11:46Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.55, 0.45, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [14027, "2021-06-17T05:29:51Z", [0.0, 0.23, 0.57, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [34959, "2021-06-17T05:28:54Z", [0.01, 0.2, 0.67, 0.12, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [34815, "2021-06-17T03:52:22Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [99943, "2021-06-17T03:35:23Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "The gentle decline and plateau before cases rise again because of Delta."], [96828, "2021-06-17T02:46:24Z", [0.0, 0.23, 0.42, 0.33, 0.02, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [95992, "2021-06-17T01:29:50Z", [0.0, 0.03, 0.35, 0.48, 0.14, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "Seeing a small uptick in the recent moving averages.

[See the bottom of these comments; this is likely wrong.] Cases hovering just under 100k/week. The prevalence of the Delta variant is about just over 6% now. Its prevalence in the UK was approximately the same in late April, with some places higher and some lower. So, it's possible that we could see cases hover around 100k/week for a few weeks. Reducing weight for higher numbers, but belatedly adding weight to the 60k to 100k bin, in case the forecast week comes in just under 100k. PS Here's something else to think about, friends, if you haven't already: Pfizer vaccine efficacy against ancestral strains (after fully vaccinated): \"95% effective at preventing laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 illness in people without evidence of previous infection\" in clinical trials; similar in the real world. Similar results for Moderna.\nPfizer vaccine efficacy against the Delta variant (after fully vaccinated): 88%. Probably similar for Moderna. Great news, right? The Pfizer vaccine is almost as effective against the Delta variant as it is against ancestral strains! But what does 88% vaccine efficacy against illness mean? It means that when a group of people who were fully vaccinated were compared with a (hopefully well matched) group of people who were not vaccinated, the group that was vaccinated had 88% of the number of illnesses that would have been expected if the same percentage of them had gotten illnesses as was seen among the vaccinated. Concrete example: 100 vaccinated, 100 unvaccinated. 10 people get sick in the unvacc group; 1 gets sick in the vacc group. Here's the problem. The Delta strain is almost 3x as contagious as ancestral strains. That means (roughly speaking) that if 10 people are in the community with Delta infections and 10 people are in the community with ancestral strain infections, then the people with Delta with infections will be expected to start ~3x as many new infections as the people with the ancestral strains. And that means that almost 3x as many vaccinated people will likely be getting infected, too, especially if they engage in riskier behaviors like socializing indoors in public places without masks. Yes, the efficacies of the Pfizer and likely Moderna vaccines are almost equal against the Delta strain and ancestral strains. But that doesn't mean vaccinated people's *chances* of getting infected by either strain are the same, all other things being equal. Given that infection rates among the vaccinated are very low, I don't think this will contribute meaningfully to the forecast question, but it's something to keep in mind. PPS Another source now says 9.6k cases for June 12. And another source, more reliable, also says 9,427.

Noting that the 7-day average of confirmed Covid cases in the UK has gone up by a factor of 2.1 in the past 13 days, since May 25, this could get ugly quickly. The Delta strain is ~3x more infectious than ancestral strains; R0 for the Delta strain is in the low end of measles territory (measles range 5.4\u201318, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/25/1/17-1901_article). As of June 7, 52.2% of the US population has had at least one vaccine dose, and 42.6% are fully vaccinated. As of May 25, 57.6% of the UK had received at least one dose, and 35.4% of the population was fully vaccinated. So we are in a slightly better position than the UK was in terms of the number of people fully vaccinated as the Delta variant starts to spread widely, but not by much. (Note that 1 dose of a 2\u2013dose vaccine has only had 30% efficacy against symptomatic infection in the UK.)\nIf we go with the doubling time of ~13 days seen in the UK recently, then what could be seen in the US is a 7\u2013day average of cases on July 3 at ~3.6x cases now = 58k/day = 403k/week. A lot of variables are at play, including how the CDC and regional governments would respond, e.g., whether the CDC would reverse its positions on masks. I think cases/day could easily double before most places start to react; any changes would then take another week to start slowing down cases, and we'd be almost at the end of the forecast period.\nIn sum:\n* Delta is spreading.
