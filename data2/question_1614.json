Paulo Guedes has been in office since last January, so it not impossible that he will leave/get replaced based on this base rate. Assuming that he will follow his precedent ministers' destiny and leave the office in one year, the probability that he leaves/gets replaced in the next two months is around 15%.  If I were wrong, it is most likely to be a result of the unpredictability of geopolitics events. There might be some rumors that people inside Brazil will know, but I will not know by searching on Google. There could also be some more aggressive spending plans designed by the president and worsen the relationship between the president and the minister.  During COVID-19, there has been a growing disagreement between the President and Guedes on big government spending. Since two major figures have already left, it seems like there is still a lot of volatility in Guedes position. Based on this fact, I adjust the probability of him being replaced to be 20%. There have been rumors of potential candidates replacing Guedes since a month ago. However, the person involved quickly dismissed this rumor. Since then, the president and Guedes have been having much less public disagreement (source: https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2020/09/03/brazils-president-and-his-economy-minister-start-to-disagree). Since replacing a government official doesn't seem to be very hard in Brazil, the fact that the president has not done it yet makes me suspect that they might have entered some sort of agreement to stop fighting.

This resulted in the firing of Brazil's Health Minister. Shortly thereafter, the successor to the Health Minister position resigned four week later. Other members that have left Bolsonaro's cabinet include the Chief Justice Minister who resigned as a protest to Bolsonaro's firing the federal police chief. As @hermannviktor pointed out, these departures were due to catalysts in Brazillian politics, such as the coronavirus pandemic, and it is unclear what/when the next catalyst might be.  While there has been criticism on Guedes over his public spending policy, on August 17th, in an article by Reuters, it is stated by internal sources that Guedes does not intend to resign, nor is this being considered by the ministry or the central bank [1]. However I believe that if Bolsonaro and Guedes disagree enough on policies, this will lead to either the firing or resignation of Guedes.  In more recent news, dailytimes points out that the spending during coronavirus, controlled by Bolsonaro, has blown through the budget limits set by Guedes, and there has been clashes between Guedes and Bolsonaro over a spending policy around Bolsa Familia welfare program. I believe that if Bolsanaro and Guedes objectives become too misaligned, this can lead to Guedes' departure.

Out of these 4 occurrences, 3 happened upon Bolsonaro's decision and 1 happened due to a scandal. Brazil has 16 cabinet members, thus so far around 1/4 of the cabinet has lost their position. However, we need to account for the fact that most of those happened amid turmoils in politics mainly due to Covid. Therefore, we need to try to predict how likely it is that there will be another catalyst in Brazilian politics that will make Guedes leave his position. Adjustments:\nCovid:\nThe turmoil started in April, at a time when Covid has not hit Brazil yet. However, since then Brazil is among the countries hit hardest by the pandemic. This has shifted everyone's focus on the pandemic as opposed to Bolsonaro's changes in Brazilian politics.\nPosition:\nThe two major figures who left the cabinet were people who were closely linked to Bolsonaro's decisions related to their field (e.g. the Justice Minister left after there was a decision about Bolsonaro having more power on the legal system). However, there have been no major economic disagreements between Bolsonaro and his cabinet. Therefore, until there is no economic discrepancy between Bolsonaro and his cabinet, it is not unlikely that Guedes stays. Conclusion: As @pchi has pointed out in one of his links, there has been some disagreements between Bolsonaro and Guedes about the Brazilian budget due to the pandemic, which might be a catalyst in the future. However, we still don't see it very likely as of now that this issue would escalate until year end. The yearly budget will need to be approved for 2021, however this usually happens in the end of December, which, however, is out of the question's scope.

Guedes has been in charge since Jan 1, 2019 and has thus likely already developed substantial credibility as a result having not left his position yet.

Regarding the health ministry, again the comparison does not make that much sense as Brazil was one of the countries was one of the countries worst affected by covid-19. It has had 4m confirmed cases largely on the president\u2019s fault. Given this disastrous health results, it is unsurprising to see such unstability at health ministy. On the other hand, Salim Mattar, Brazil\u2019s privatization secretary, and Paulo Uebel, the debureaucratisation secretary, walked out on August 11 after complaining about the lack of progress in the government\u2019s economic agenda.

Thus, we put the probability that Guedes leaves his position at slightly higher to adjust for other reasons for his \"departure\" -> 22%.

At most, it seemed like maybe a 1/3 chance of him resigning at the time. As mentioned in the articles, there is ongoing tension about the administration's economic policies. The president has extended significant social benefit programs in response to the coronavirus, but Guedes is a staunch UChicago school economist. He opposes any renewal of Brazil's previous proclivity for excessive spending. \n- He recently lost another battle to Bolsonaro on a matter relatively unrelated to the government's coronavirus response. At Guedes' request, the government freezed hiring for new positions (previously existing positions could still be filled). This was just lifted so Brazil's FBI and FDA could hire more investigators, among other new employees. This seems like the administration is kind of spitting in the fact of Guedes', as this policy change delivers him another defeat on a relatively unimportant issue. \n- Guedes' is the subject of an investigation into his dealings with pension funds. However, the investigation was opened in 2018 and there have been few, if any, developments since then. Also, Brazil's justice system moves relatively slowly. He would only be forced to leave if massive revelations came to light and the public demanded his ouster. Bolsonaro is also no friend of the justice system, and he is more likely than not to oppose any attempts by the justice department to intervene in his administration. \n- previous ministers of the economy have stayed in office for about 1 year on average. Guedes' is on the longer end of the typical range. That being said, it seems like ministers who are the first to fill their position in that administration stay longer than replacements.  Reasons he might stay: \n- Don't want to do too much psychological speculation, but he is not a politician, he's not affiliated with a political party, and he has no future political ambition. This makes Guedes far less likely to leave the administration than Sergio Moro, who seems to be positioning himself to run in the next election (he is younger and beloved by the public--so he may have wanted to distance himself from the unpopular Bolsonaro administration). In other words, this is the most important (and probably the last) job that Guedes will ever have. He seems more likely to leave out of principle than out of a fear that remaining in the administration would impact him in the future. \n- The worse the economic/public health situation gets in Brazil, the more likely it is that Guedes leaves. However, the coronavirus has slightly receded, the economy has improved (the Real and equity market are both up about 40% over the past few months), and Bolsonaro's popularity is at a recent high (his unfavorables have fallen by over 10 percent and his favorables have risen over 10% in this last month). \n- Guedes has suffered several major policy defeats over the past few months (he opposed the hiring un-freeze and, more notably, the renewal of Brazil's equivalent of the $600 stimulus checks), but he has remained in office nonetheless. There do not seem to be any major issues on the horizon that would bring his tensions will Bolsonaro to a \"final showdown\"--it appeared that the renewal of the stimulus checks was most likely to cause this, but that has now come and gone. \n- Firing Guedes would have a strong, negative impact on Brazil's stock market, as it would signal the end of the fiscal responsibility that has briefly renewed investor confidence in Brazil (at least relative to previous administrations). It seems unlikely that Boslonaro would fire Guedes, as it would worsen economic/political instability in the country with little benefit; Boslonaro has already shown that he can overrule Guedes on policy, so firing Guedes has few practical advantages.\n- Guedes and his team are currently working on the revamp of Renda Brazil (the main social program in Brazil); they are not expected to release their proposal until next year, and it seems unlikely that Guedes would voluntarily leave before then.  To be honest, I have no idea how to weight these different components quantitatively. That said, I figure the probability of him leaving back in April (when the speculation about his departure reached its peak) was 1/3 at a maximum. There are only two ways for him to leave: resign or be fired. Because firing Guedes would destabilize the tenuous balance Bolsonaro has struck both politically and economically over the past few months, it seems very unlikely that Bolsonaro will fire Guedes. I'd estimate it to be 10%, which mainly corresponds to the possibility that the economy significantly worsens over the next few months. Guedes also seems relatively unlikely to leave on his own accord; there are no major obstacles on the horizon that could reignite his tensions with the president, he is currently revamping Renda Brazil, and he has already suffered several major policy defeats without resigning or making a spectacle. It seems that if he were going to resign, he already would have. I put the probability of him leaving at roughly 1/3 the probability in April, so 11%.

Consider, against the backdrop of the departure of the respected Mansueto after 3 years + on the job,  that the US Treasury has just released its latest TIC data, that indicates the amount of US Trasury instruments held by \"foreign countries\" (governments, investors, proxies, fronts yatta yatta).   The new TIC reportIn  link https://ticdata.treasury.gov/Publish/mfh.txt  shows that Brazil, or whoever the Treasury in Washington classifies as Brazil, the government, private banks, money market operators, hedge fund tyros, others who may act as fronts or proxies, that during  the \"current\" month analysed (end April to end March \"window\"), Brazil has dumped another $4.9 billion in US Treasury instruments, which amounds to a little over 20 billion Reais at the current (5.15 more or less) exchange rate.  Now, add that $4.9 to the agreggate from \"last month's TIC data,   (TIC report link https://ticdata.treasury.gov/Publish/mfh.txt ) and what you will see in black and white is that Brazil interests dumped $21 billion in US Treasury instruments between end of Feb. and Mar. of this year. Carry that total ($26 billion) back to the end of August 2019s year and you will note that from end of August to end of January this year, Brazil has sold roughly $27.5 billion for a total of $53.5 of its US Treasury holdings on Guedes' and Mansueto's and the Central Bank's watch (the bank operates quase-independently as part of \"his\" (technicarally Bolsonaro's) economy superministry.  Brazil media has not been \"following the money\" so to speak. Nor  has Brasilia offered explanation for the drawdown of $53.5 billion in US Treasury instruments since August last year, roughly 267bilion reais at an aggregate 5.0-$1 rate). That total in itself represents  more than the  total Treasury holds of each of the follwoing nations, Israel, Mexico, Italy, and the Nethands.  Hardly Friedmanesque...  Funchal's image in the media projects as from a younger, post-Guedes, generation, like some of the other youthful ministers and second echelon secretaries the Bolsonaros team has  been embedding into his governing mechanism. For now, treasury is his job to lose.  But these are not normal times in Brazil especially when the current president likes to override ministerial decisions.  Guedes' future as superminister has much to do  with how much he chooses to play ball with the praetorian guard that protects Bolsonaro (a man currently without a political party) working from their offices near his in the Planalto presidential palace. They too have their own (sometime divergent views on how the economy should be \"norteado\" (Portuguese for, to find its true north) through the continuing crisis. Then too, Guedes' future could be influenced by the Bolsonaro family \"guru\" the philsopher-astrologer known as Olavo de Carvalho.
