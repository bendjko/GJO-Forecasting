The 12 months will cover Jan 2020 to Dec 2020.

Their latest forecast is from Jan 15th 2020 and gives a 26% chance of a recession in the next 12 months (I presume this means from Feb 2020 to Jan 2021). How should we interpret these probabilities? I assume that if a recession starts in month X it will last for some time. Let's say for the rest of the period that we are looking at. So a recession that starts in Apr 2020 will last (at least) until Dec 2020 (for the Federal Reserve data) or Jan 2021 (for the Bloomberg data). When the probability for a recession is x% in the next 12 months, then the probability for NO recession in this period is (100-x)%. The probability per month that there is no recession is then (1-x)^(1/12). (This implies independence and that is probably not the case). The probability per month that there is no recession, based on the forecast by the Federal Reserve Bank, is then 0.9778%. When we use the Bloomberg prognosis it is 0.9752%. From historic data we know that in a recession the unemployment rate rises at about 0.23% per month. The latest data (December 2020) has unemployment at 3.5% and it is steady around this value now for about 4 months. So it would take about 2 months to reach the limit of 4%. This means that the recession would have to start at the latest on 2010-09-01 or before that.  Working with the data of the Federal Bureau Bank there are 8 months to go. The probability that there is \\textbf{no} recession is 0.9778^8=0.8356. \nWorking with the Bloomberg data there are 7 months to go. The probability that there is NO recession is 0.9752^}=0.8388.  Conclusion: about 84% chance that there is no recession (or 16% that there is a recession) in the period of interest. Because there is already a chance of 14% that the 4%-limit can be broken without a recession I put the overall probability at 20%. The figure to look out for is the unemployment rate: does it keep steady at around 3.5% or not?"], [31275, "2020-01-27T20:28:34Z", [0.05], "I stand corrected. Projections are 3.4 to 3.5.

Time series data for the past 10 years shows a dramatic fall in the unemployment rate.  Currently the unemployment rate is quite low.  The past decade has been a time of unusually low interest rates.   Folks seem confident that the FED won't reverse course and tighten before November so it's possible the economy may remain stable during this period, consumer spending may continue apace, and the unemployment rate may stay low.   If you take the data for the past 10 years and search for the time (in months) for the rate either to increase by 0.5% or decrease by 0.5% there is some nice fluctuation to be seen.   55% of the time, this happens in 5 months or less.  23% of the time this happens between 5 and 10 months.  23% of the time this happens between 10 and 16 months.   There has never been a period longer than 16 months during this time when the unemployment rate did not either rise or fall by 0.5.   There are almost 10 months to go on this question.  If we look backward we have already been in the 4% - 3% band for 11 months.  So if the answer is to be 0% the rate will have to stay within this band for 20 months altogether.  Perhaps this should make me nervous. Also, when you get closer to zero unemployment, the unemployed population becomes more and more difficult to employ for various reasons.  At some point, as economic circumstances change, you approach a barrier that makes the rate more likely to rise than to fall, so when it does change, perhaps it will be more likely to go to 4% rather than 3%. An 0.5% fluctuation isn't much, so it could happen.  An additional straw in the wind is the news that some Boeing suppliers have run out their string on the 737 Max debacle and have announced layoffs just recently.    When the question ends, either the unemployment rate will have exceeded 4% or it will not have done so.   Despite all the aforementioned negative factors, I have to say I don't think this will happen.

In 67 of these Nov-Oct time frames, there was at least one month with a reported U3 rate of 4.0% or above, giving a base rate of 94.4%. Interestingly, in the last 20 years, all Nov-Oct timeframes had at least one U3 rate a 4% or above. Putting it yet a different way, it would be the first time since Nov 1968 to Oct 1969 that the U3 would be below 4.0% for all months of this period. What are arguments in favor of U3<4% for any month in the time frame?\n- the presidential election year was mentioned multiple times in the discussion, and I agree that this might lead to higher than usual efforts to keep the data looking favorable\n- @Chrisp mentions some indicators that encourage a stable/positive outlook with respect to unemployment:  https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/936720 , https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/936743\n- the current expansion has been going a lot longer than many have predicted or expected - maybe it will keep going just that little bit longer (with a little help from a president running for re-election)? I am starting to think that there might also be some fundamental economic mechanisms that are shifting, rendering some of the approaches to thinking about the economy that used to work less useful.  What are arguments against U3<4% for any month in the time frame?\n- the above base rate is very high for at least one month hitting or exceeding 4% \n- with unemployment rates below 4%, this is close to (or maybe by definition already) full-employment - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_employment .

It would take little more than 2 months before the limit of 4% is broken. So the real question is: will there be a recession in the first nine months of 2020? The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has a model. The success rate of this model in the period from 1961 up to now is 5/9=56%: in the nine situations where the model had a peak probability for a recession of 40% or less (about what is predicted for Aug 2020), the recession did materialise in 5 cases. However: the Fed did react swiftly when the spread (this is the predictor that the Fed's model uses) went negative in the period from Jun 2019 to Sep 2019. So this might have an impact.

I think I was being a little too high level with my initial forecast. I failed to properly account for the serial correlation inherent in data like unemployment and inflation. To take a step back, I started thinking about what it would take to get 4% U3.  With the labor force at 160m, the US would need to lose 800k jobs for unemployment to hit 4%. That is an average of 67k jobs per month over the next 12 months. To further contextualize it, the US lost 8m jobs in the financial crisis (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PAYEMS) While I think there are risks to the US outlook, an employment loss of that magnitude seems unlikely without a significant demand shock. Further, the willingness of the Fed to provide accommodation should prevent smaller risks from materializing.  Therefore, I\u2019m thinking the appropriate base rate was closer to 35%. Continued strength in the labor marker, lower investment in productivity enhancement, removal of near-term risks (https://seekingalpha.com/article/4312425) all pull the odds closer to 20%.

Recessions tend to start between 6-24 months after the rate of the 3 month treasury bonds rises above the 10 year treasury bond. Also recessions are about 6-12 months away after that inversion reinverts so that the 3 month is back to normal, being below the 10 year rate. The rate inverted in May 2019, they deinverted in October 2019 about a month after the new york fed had started pumping about $160 billion per day into the repo market. The fed rate is only 1 indicator for recession, the quantitative easing by the fed is another indicator. It looks like summer is when the economy should see some job losses. I predict that the job losses will balloon over time to affect the financial market, when the financial market begins to fall apart this will cause the funds (which wall st depends on) to also fall apart which will create a feedback loop between it and the bigger economy (the \"consumer\").  The last recession was pushed back from a depression by looting the retirement funds, but this time around I dont see what there is for the elite to loot since the average westerner lives paycheck to paycheck. So we will see if this time around turns into a depression. Either way, the job losses might be delayed from the summer, but I see no way that the government or the business sector could possibly push the job losses back past the winter. I think the unemployment rate should reach 4% very quickly once the job losses begin. We should see investment bank bankruptcies soon (a few months) following it. The infection will spread to the entire western world in a week or two. China will be fine though, as long as they continue their trade war with the west and refuse to give in.

I mostly hold this view because the unemployment data shows that, barring a recession, the U3 rarely rises steeply - and a recession seems unlikely at the moment. I will revise if the unemployment rate ticks up from 3.6% in the next few months.
