Saudi Arabia is among those hoping that logic still holds in Vienna.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nCOMMENT: Time to go low!"], [41318, "2020-03-05T05:27:53Z", [0.49, 0.43, 0.08], ""], [79660, "2020-03-05T05:23:44Z", [0.89, 0.11, 0.0], ""], [29646, "2020-03-05T04:01:20Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], "No economic indicators that would point to a sudden surge in prices."], [80367, "2020-03-04T23:23:09Z", [0.7, 0.25, 0.05], ""], [81559, "2020-03-04T17:57:00Z", [0.95, 0.04, 0.01], ""], [34376, "2020-03-04T16:02:48Z", [0.97, 0.03, 0.0], ""], [81342, "2020-03-04T15:59:09Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], "The Energy Information Agency (EIA) has estimated that the price of Brent crude oil will average $58 per barrel in the first half of 2020 before rising to an average of $64 per barrel in the final 6 months of 2020.  The EIA has made this forecast based on the expectation that inventories (i.e. supply) of oil increased in 2020 and will decrease in 2021.  The EIA\u2019s forecast does not include any disruptions to oil supply (which would most likely increase the price of Brent crude oil).   Due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, investors are \u201cpanicking\u201d and the markets (stock exchanges et al.) have gone down.  Since oil is fundamental to markets, its price (including that of Brent crude) has decreased. OPEC will be holding its meeting on March 5-6, 2020 to determine if they will extend the current production cuts of 1.7 million barrels per day that they agreed would run from December 2019 until the end of March 2020.  It is expected that OPEC will extend their production cuts.  Even if production cuts are extended, for now, the supply of oil is greater than the current demand.  The price of Brent crude may increase once OPEC\u2019s decision is made public.  However, the price increase may be negligible and/or temporary given the EIA\u2019s forecast. For now, I am confident that the closing price of Brent crude oil will be below $63 by the end of the day March 31, 2020.

Another reason is due to oversupply in the oil market - one expected to last for the first half of 2020. This is due to continued growth by US shale producers. Furthermore, OECD countries' oil inventories are 9 million barrels above the five-year average - with plenty other strategic stockpiles to call upon in the event of an outage.  Thus, oil prices are most likely to stay in the $63-69 per barrel range - accounting for persistent geopolitical tensions in the region despite the deescalation in tensions between the US and Iran. Scenarios where oil trades higher include further supply cuts by OPEC states and Russia (OPEC+) and/or a marked increase in tensions in Iraq.

Economic conditions are, in general, slow evolving while political events are sporadic and sudden.  The latter introduce jolts to the system and hence affect the oil prices.  As the political situation stabilizes, oil prices tend to go back to their underlying pre-jolt values.  (This is my view anyway.) Lets look at the oil prices in the last year.  There is a sharp drop in the oil price in early June 2019 due to worries about the global economy (1).  It hovers around $63 for the rest of the year (2).  Many events happened in the Middle East during this period: attack and seizure of oil tankers, attack of the Saudi\u2019s oil production facilities, downing of US and Iranian drones, and the recent killing of an Iranian General and Iranian missile attack on military bases in Iraq.  Despite spiking after these events, the oil prices appear to drop back to a level perceivably sustainable by the economic condition (hovering around $63). From June 3, 2019 till now, the average Brent oil is $62.6 with a standard deviation of $2.7.  56% of the daily close prices are <$63, 43% between $63 and $69 and 1% >$69.  I consider this as the baseline case for recent oil prices perturbed by political events. There is no way to tell when the current political situation will stabilize.  Another way to examine the situation is to analyze the prices from Nov 1, 2019 to now and use the analysis to forecast the oil price two and half month in the future (March 31, 2020) (Nov 1 is two and half month in the past).

Oil (even Brent) is priced in dollars so a weakening dollar increases prices because it takes more of a less valuable currency to buy one unit of the commodity.  Lately, a big portion of the dollars fluctuations has had to do with Federal Reserve policy expectations and demand for Treasurys, among other things (https://www.thebalance.com/value-of-us-dollar-3306268). A recently improving global outlook, decline in trade risk, and solid data from the US consumer have encouraged the Fed to maintain their path holding rates constant. While I do not think these conditions will last, my base case (as I\u2019ve shared in other forecasts) is for a strong Q1 followed by increasing uncertainty as the risks from 2019 that were \u201ckicked down the road\u201d in Q4 materialize. At least in the near-term, the markets seem to have similar view of Fed action (https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html).  So what does this mean for oil prices? A steady Fed translates to a flat or strengthening dollar (all else equal) which will put downward pressure on oils prices. That combined with reduced geo-political tensions in recent weeks makes me think oil prices will return to their range from the past few months.

Any conflict in the Middle East is bound to shock oil markets higher, because it threatens to destabilize the center of the global oil market. But the size of the rally and its impact on particular stocks are unique to this conflict and the recent history of oil price movements. Brent crude futures rose 3.8% to $68.84 a barrel in Friday morning trading, and futures on West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, the market benchmark in the U.S., gained 3.7% to $63.44. Recent history is affecting Friday\u2019s move. The latest similar oil spike occurred on Sept. 16, the first trading day after a series of attacks on Saudi Arabian oil infrastructure. Brent jumped 20% after the attacks to $71.95, before slipping back below $70. Within two weeks, oil prices had retraced all of their gains, and the stocks that had followed the commodity higher had plunged. That has left traders a little wary of chasing a rally that is based on geopolitical considerations that are difficult to predict. \u201cWe expect a near term increase in commodity prices to favor U.S. E&Ps, particularly high beta name where there is also a fair amount of short interest as well,\u201d wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Scott Hanold in a note on Friday. \u201cHowever, investors could be a bit more gun shy given how quickly equities retraced following the Saudi attack in September\u201d (Para. 1-5). *\nReference\n* Salzman, A.

It is most sensitive to the global economic outlook (demand), OPEC+ and other (primarily US shale producers) supply, and geo-political risks (https://www.eia.gov/finance/markets/crudeoil/). Let's start with some forecasts:\n- EIA suggests $59 a barrel for Brent in March (https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/data/browser/#/?v=8&f=M&s=0&start=201501&end=202012&ctype=linechart&maptype=0&linechart=BREPUUS~&map=)\n- WSJ survey suggests a range of $52 - 64 (with a similar midpoint as EIA) (https://www.wsj.com/graphics/econsurvey/) On the demand front, consensus estimates from major banks and asset managers is for an increase in global GDP growth is 2020 (https://www.wsj.com/graphics/econsurvey/). Major themes are a reduction in trade uncertainty, global CB easing, strong consumer, etc. This increase would support higher demand and higher prices. My view is for a short-term cyclical re-firming over the next few months. However, the realities of the global trade impasse and limited CB effectiveness will ultimately bring expectations down. On the supply side, OPEC+ recently agreed to cut production by an additional 500k barrels starting in 2020 (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-opec/opec-sees-small-2020-oil-deficit-even-before-latest-supply-cut-idUSKBN1YF1LK) and US shale producers are focusing on paying down debts and improving cash flows (https://www.wsj.com/articles/frackers-prepare-to-pull-back-exacerbating-a-slowdown-in-u-s-oil-growth-11573478550).  To me, one of the most interesting dynamics in oil markets is the cap that shale producers have put of global oil prices. This cap keeps the range on WTI between $40-60 a barrel (which typically trades at a $6-7 discount to Brent - based on a simple regression of WTI to Brent using EIA data). The discount has a lot to do with higher transport and refining costs for WTI. Getting back to the range, however, the Fed Bank of Dallas (https://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2019/0521) suggests that long-dated futures are a good proxy for this breakeven based on the marginal cost of supply. That theory and futures contract data from the CME Group (https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/energy/crude-oil/brent-crude-oil.html) suggest that it will be difficult for prices to rise much above $60. I don't have too much on the geo-political front - obviously tail risks remain. However, if September taught me anything, it is that uncertainty in the Middle East doesn't impact prices like it used to. Short of a hot war, I don't think there will be much price action. Bringing it back together, here is a brief summary:\n\t- increasing prices over the next few months\n\t\t- diminished trade uncertainty drives improving global outlook through Feb\n\t\t- US producers rig cuts and OPEC+ cuts limit global supply\n\t\t- weaker dollar as the Fed holds steady on rates\n\t- decline later in March and February\n\t\t- actual text of US China trade deal disappoints relative to expectations\n\t\t- UK trade deal uncertainty increases after vote to leave \n\t\t- rising prices improve prospects for shale producers and more supply pulling prices down\n\t- Risks:\n\t\t- consensus economic outlook (~2% GDP growth) is correct supporting higher prices\n\t\t- Trade deals meet expectations\n\t\t- US production stays low as producers pay off debts and focus on positive cash flow\n\t\t- Scope - my outlook could be right, but it doesn't materialize until later in the year Ultimately, I believe lower prices are the most likely outcome but the scope of this question limits my willingness to bet. Over the time-frame, I see plenty of risks on the upside. That being said, most of the upside risks are expectations-based (and I anticipate the market is a little too bullish at the moment)."], [691, "2019-12-21T14:52:02Z", [0.51, 0.47, 0.02], ""], [80764, "2019-12-21T14:04:09Z", [0.35, 0.45, 0.2], ""], [1034, "2019-12-21T05:40:15Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], "Geiger, J.
