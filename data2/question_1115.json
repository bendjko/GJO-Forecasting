On the merits, and under principles of equal protection and free speech, the SCOTUS has routinely found State sanctioned political discrimination to be inappropriate and constitutionally protected in analogous circumstances.  The more liberal justices will almost certainly vote to overturn these politically cynical power-grabs, that deliberately aim to (and effectively do) minimize the effective voting power of an entire political group. That said, mired factual questions about what a state legislature's \"predominant purpose\" is from year to year in redistricting maps threatens to place judges and juries far too often in a position of constant review of potentially political questions, which conservative jurists are ordinarily hesitant to indulge. As a policy matter, once any party gains control of the state legislature, that party can make it more difficult (if not impossible) for the losing party to regain control of the legislature.  Future generations, even a majority, would be unfairly deprived of political voice and representation by the votes of their ancestors that either diluted or isolated their votes, undermining the democratic principles that the Constitution aims to protect.   Chief Justice John Roberts has an eye on maintaining the integrity of the Court, and diminishing the public perception of it as a political institution.  That concern alone will open him sincerely to voting with the liberal justices if the opinion can be drafted in a manner that comports with his conservative jurisprudence.   The increasing political volatility in our society threatens to be further exasperated where representation of majorities are ignored and systematically undermined.  I think the chief will vote with the liberals on this one.

I skimmed the transcripts and read some of the commentary.   I previously predicted that there would likely be a 4-4 split between the Republican and Democratic appointees on Maryland's gerrymandering.  The court would not interfere in North Carolina.   However, Roberts might find a problem with Maryland's gerrymandering because it was unique, was contrary to the census result and a change would benefit Republicans.  Today, he did find Maryland's gerrymandering bothersome because of First Amendment concerns.  That is,  the gerrymandering was intended to punish Republicans for announcing there support for Republican causes.   Kavanagh was a surprise because he kept asking if the constitution required proportional representation.  That is, if a party received 40 percent of the vote, should it always receive 40 percent of the seats in congress?   His questions suggested he believes that gerrymandered maps are only a problem when they do not result in proportional representation.  He also asked if the maps followed logical boundaries, e.g., city and county boundaries, rivers, coastlines, etc. would still be a problem if they resulted non-proportional representation.   I am wondering if he is thinking of a way to approve gerrymandering in some states but not others.   I think the real unspoken consideration for Kavenagh and the other conservatives is the changing demographics.  Younger voters are voting more and more Democratic, and without gerrymandering, the Republicans maybe out of national office in the next ten to fifteen years.    I need to know a little more about what maybe motivating Kavanagh.  How partisan is he really?  How much are his legal tests results oriented?   Roberts is clear about the courts legacy under his leadership.  I recently saw a video of him giving a speech where he distinguished between past consequential and inconsequential Supreme Court Justices.  He was trying to make his audience laugh, but it does indicate that a Supreme Court justice's legacy is something he thinks about.  He argues that finding gerrymandering unconstitutional would lead to clogged courts with challenges and greatly damage the court's reputation.  This could also work the other way and ensure one person one vote.   Anyway, there are now two possible yes votes to add to the four Democratic appointed justices' votes. There is a lot of precedent for not finding unconstitutionality.       So after rambling,  I suspect the vote will likely be 5-4 in favor of finding no unconstitutionality.   There is probably a 15 percent change of Roberts and 10 percent chance of Kavanagh voting with the liberals in the Maryland case and less than 5 percent of either voting yes in the North Carolina case.

Jubelirer, 541 U.S. 267 (2004). First, is partisan gerrymandering a non-justiciable issue because of the political question doctrine? Second, should the 14th or the 1st Amendment control if the issue of political gerrymandering is in fact something the Court can address?  I have serious doubts that the Court will reach the second question, so I'll focus on the first. In Vieth v. Jubelirer, five Justices held that the plaintiffs hadn't proven a constitutional violation, and that no court could formulate a legal standard to control cases involving partisan gerrymandering. Four of the Justices in the plurality also held that political gerrymandering was a purely political question, and therefore, the Court should stay out of it. Our old pal Justice Kennedy didn't take that step. Instead, he said that there might be a 1st Amendment rationale, but since it wasn't raised, down go the plaintiffs.  Since 2004, the Court has undergone some changes, so let's stack up our Justices by how they'll likely rule: Justices in favor of finding the maps unconstitutional:  Justices Ginsburg and Breyer wrote a dissent to Vieth v. Jubelirer, arguing that political gerrymandering cases are justiciable, so they appear easy to predict. Justice Sotomayor has become the most confrontational of the liberal justices against the conservative majority, so let's go ahead and put her here. Justice Kagan has previously alluded to supporting cases against political gerrymandering, so she's likely on this side (although she's not a lock; she's shown a willingness to go along with conservative justices in recent rulings). Most likely scenario for this side: 3 or 4 votes. Justices against finding the maps unconstitutional: Justice Thomas was on the Court and agreed with the plurality in Vieth that the case violated the political question doctrine, so he appears easy to predict. Justice Alito has been openly hostile to the idea of striking down these maps, so put him here, too. Chief Justice Roberts, who has crossed over a few times in recent memory, seems unlikely to do so here. While he and Alito expressed some concerns about overly partisan gerrymandering in oral arguments, there is, after all, his remark that all the data supporting the plaintiffs' claims are \u201csociological gobbledygook.\u201d So...you know...that doesn't seem good. Gorsuch said, along with Justice Thomas, that he would've dismissed the cases entirely instead of sending them back to the lower courts to resolve the standing issues, so count him here. That brings it down to Justice Kavanaugh, who replaced the former swing vote on this issue, Justice Kennedy.  Justice Kavanaugh has never ruled on this issue before, so we don't have any kind of track record to go on. But this is also the guy who, in his confirmation hearing, said that he thought all the claims brought against him were a conspiracy organized by the Clintons to get back at him for the role he played in the Monica Lewinsky affair. Despite his assurances that he can rule fairly, that's not the kind of a statement you'd expect to hear from a solidly non-partisan thinker. If the Court developed a standard (if there is such a standard to be found), Republican-controlled state legislatures would have the most to lose since they have primarily been the ones in power during the rise of the big-data-driven gerrymandering movement. I don't think that Justice Kavanaugh would overtly consider this in making his decision, but Justices are not machines; their implicit biases influence their decisions. So I think you line him up over here. Most likely scenario: 5 votes Of course, there's a third option: the Court doesn't have a majority opinion, which would mean the lower court's ruling would stand. I give this a low possibility of happening, and even if it did, it wouldn't be the Supreme Court finding the maps unconstitutional.  More than likely: the Court will find that it does not have the authority to interfere in the drawing of any lines, even if they're done for highly partisan purposes.

In Maryland, plaintiffs are residents of a single district whereas in N.C., plaintiffs are \"voters at large.\" I believe the SCOTUS will agree that plaintiffs in at least one of the cases have standing. Second, what will Justice Kavanaugh think? The current SCOTUS (after Kennedy's retirement) is tied 4-4, making him the tie-breaker. He appears to be a consistent supporter of First Amendment rights, especially for the right of citizens to petition the government and democratic self-governance. In fact, his favorite line in the Citizens United case is, \"\u201cThe concept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment.\u201d Since Citizens United established that political fund raising & ad spending is a form of free speech and that there should be no limits placed on this limit, I believe he is likely to be swayed by the plaintiffs' argument that extremely gerrymandering unfairly restricts free speech for citizens living within a gerrymandered district or near one.\n\nLastly, regarding if the SCOTUS has the authority to intervene in state laws regarding redistricting, the answer is pretty clear. In the case of racially-motivated gerrymandering, Batson v. Kentucky authorizes the Court to intervene. The argument plaintiffs will likely argue is not whether gerrymandering is acceptable, but whether gerrymandering for purely political reasons is acceptable. In N.C., legislators clearly stated on the record that their goal was to preserve the 10-3 GOP advantage. Similarly, in Maryland, the purpose was to \"go for the Sixth [district]\". In both racial and political gerrymandering, the goal is to nakedly keep power in the hands of the current leaders, thus depriving citizens of the value of their vote. Ultimately, I think the question will come down to if it is permissible to allow gerrymandering, if the only purpose is to explicitly preserve the current power structure, and not for some other reason (which the SCOTUS will punt on). https://www.scotusblog.com/2018/08/judge-kavanaugh-and-freedom-of-expression/"], [67616, "2019-03-07T22:59:53Z", [0.1], ""], [56863, "2019-03-05T05:35:26Z", [0.44], ""], [1333, "2019-03-04T22:01:16Z", [0.65], ""], [62808, "2019-03-04T12:08:06Z", [0.65], ""], [28103, "2019-03-03T19:49:46Z", [0.22], ""], [67232, "2019-03-03T05:52:48Z", [0.75], ""], [67232, "2019-03-03T01:08:31Z", [0.35], "Comment deleted on Mar 03, 2019 05:52AM UTC"], [63914, "2019-03-02T15:14:07Z", [0.15], "States' rights would suggest that they remain in control of districting, because there cannot be sauce for the goose (Maryland democrats) on this one which is not sauce for the gander (old republican urban districts).

Common Cause: On August 5, 2016, Common Cause filed suit in the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, arguing that North Carolina's congressional district plan constituted an illegal partisan gerrymander. On August 22, 2016, the League of Women Voters of North Carolina filed a similar suit in the same court. The two cases were consolidated. On August 27, 2018, the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina ruled in favor of the plaintiffs. The defendants appealed this decision to the Supreme Court of the United States, which will hear oral argument on March 26, 2019.\nPoint/counterpoint: is partisan gerrymandering a violation of federal law?\nTo date, the Supreme Court of the United States has yet to issue a ruling establishing clear precedent on the justiciability of partisan gerrymandering claims under federal law. In order to summarize the competing arguments at the heart of this debate, Ballotpedia asked two redistricting authorities for their thoughts on the question.\n\nLogan C. Churchwell (Public Interest Legal Foundation): Two cases are now before the Supreme Court.  One involves a challenge to North Carolina\u2019s map. The other involves a challenge to a single district in Maryland. The cases provide something for everyone. The North Carolina challengers claim that the map unconstitutionally disadvantages Democrats. The Maryland challengers claim that the redistricting of Maryland\u2019s Sixth District unconstitutionally disadvantages Republicans. These \u201cpartisan gerrymandering\u201d claims are not new to the Supreme Court yet the Supreme Court has yet to provide guidance on how to handle such claims. One question before the Supreme Court is whether it should hear partisan gerrymandering claims at all. Looking to the Constitution, the answer is clear. The framers of the Constitution left the power to run elections to the states. This includes how the states divide their congressional districts. For courts to interfere with the state\u2019s ability to draw it\u2019s districts disrupts this important constitutional balance.\nLogan C. Churchwell is Communications Director for the Public Interest Legal Foundation.\nKati Phillips (Common Cause): The Supreme Court has long recognized the harm partisan gerrymandering causes by consistently ruling that citizens should be able to challenge maps in court. The justices have affirmed the justiciability of these challenges even in cases where it declines to strike down maps at issue in the case. For example, the Supreme Court stated in Davis v. Bandemer that \u201cwe decline to hold that such claims are never justiciable\u201d despite upholding the districts being challenged. More recently, in a predecessor case to Lamone v. Benisek called Shapiro v. McManus, the justices unanimously decided that the Maryland plaintiffs must be allowed their day in court in front of a three-judge panel.  Even in last year\u2019s disappointing outcomes in Gill v. Whitford and Benisek v. Lamone, in which the Supreme Court declined to address partisan gerrymandering claims directly, the opinions ensured that these claims would live to see another day. In Gill, the justices stated that the technical problem with the plaintiffs\u2019 case would typically lead the Supreme Court to dismiss it altogether. Calling Gill \u201cnot the usual case,\u201d the justices unanimously sent the case back to the trial court so the plaintiffs could fix their technical problems and relitigate the case.\nKati Phillips is Western Region Communications Strategist for California Common Cause."], [1333, "2019-02-13T19:22:00Z", [0.49], ""], [32300, "2019-02-13T14:17:07Z", [0.55], ""], [31450, "2019-02-12T21:12:12Z", [0.35], "Kennedy was the justice most in favor of a standard that could be used to measure and eliminate partisan gerrymandering.
