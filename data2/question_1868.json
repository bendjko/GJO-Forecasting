Further, agreement between 3 parties is harder to arrive at, than agreement between 2 parties. My mental model is that it is A LOT harder. On the other hand, the new RCEP was signed among 15 countries in ~9y (~7.5y after 1st round of negotiations) [1]; and this China-Japan-South Korea (CJK) agreement has been in the works for ~9 years (1st round of negotiations ~7.5y ago) [2]. Granted, the 15 parties of RCEP were 10 countries that were already in a FTA (ASEAN), plus 5 of their major trading partners, which made it easier. Then again, CJK are now in a FTA of their own, which by this reasoning would make CJK easier! So it's not quite as easy as I thought, to say 30% is too high. BASE RATES\nWe want to know how many multilateral FTAs are signed per year, more specifically in Asia. I decided to count since 1980 as things longer ago seemed less comparable. (Less communication technology, less globalization etc.) I found 24 FTAs signed since 1980, for a rate of ~0.585/year globally. Now, we are asking about a very specific FTA so the rate for it must be lower. Let's say there are 5 big regions of the world that might do a multilateral FTA, so specifically in Asia we would expect ~0.585/5 = 0.117/year. To get somewhat independent confirmation I counted the FTAs involving at least one East Asian country, and I found 5, for a rate of ~0.122/year. Pretty close to the 0.117 number! It seems like a good base rate --- 12%. Again, this is somewhat of an overestimate as it counts general FTAs in East Asia, not this specific one. INSIDE VIEW\nAs mentioned, CJK has been in the works for ~9y, and seriously for ~7.5y. They've had 2 meetings per year since 2016 (~3/year until 2015) [1]. It's hard to gauge progress from the minutes, but roughly speaking things were pretty vague until mid-2018. For instance, in the March 2018 meeting the members discussed \"areas such as Trade in Goods, Trade in Services, Investment, amongst others\" [4]. That's... all of the economy? Literally every meeting before Dec 2018 is described like that. On the Dec 2018 meeting, \"the three countries agreed with the acceleration of negotiations on a FTA\". But then there were only two meetings after that (Apr 2019, Nov 2019), both described thus: \"the three countries had concrete discussions on market access and rules (such as electronic commerce and intellectual property). The three countries also affirmed to continue negotiations toward the conclusion of comprehensive, high-level and mutually beneficial agreement, with regard to the progress of RCEP.\" There were no meetings in 2020. This could be because they had to finish RCEP? The coronavirus? In any case, after 1 year they were still discussing the same thing (\"electronic commerce and intellectual property\"). If there are just 1-2 more things of similar complexity to discuss, which almost certainly there are, discussions will easily go on another year. As they get close to a deal, I expect the frequency of meetings to increase, but this has not happened yet. So, based only on the inside view, I'd give this FTA a 20% chance of being concluded in 2021. And this is mostly coming from how little I know about trade negotiations, rather than really thinking there's a nontrivial chance. SYNTHESIS\nSo if I average my inside and outside views, I get 16%.

Neither country is keen to see it gain further power and influence, especially with the sudden increase in China's naval power and assertion over the local sea territories (9-dash line claims, etc). China also fails to provide transparency and honesty in its numbers regardless of topic. Increased pressure from the United States of America and other countries has also forced much of China's manufacturing into neighboring countries, particularly Vietnam. Increased class standing within China now means much of the populace has the resources (and time) to truly demand more rights from the Communist Party. Good YouTube sources include \"China Uncensored\", \"America Uncovered\", and \"ADVChina\" (vloggers -- takes time to get specifics needed).  To Be Determined...\nJoe Biden. Historically, very pro-trade with China, as well as the majority of his now selected cabinet advisors. However, action against China under Trump has been overwhelmingly supported by both parties and houses within Congress. Even Obama (Biden VP) stopped labelling China as a \"partner\" and instead referred to the PRC as a \"competitor.\" Which begs the question: What is Joe Biden's strategy towards China? Certainly less hostile than Mr. Trump, but the last four years have shown there is no reset on this relationship to pre-2016.  Unknowns...\nHow quickly India will actually move in on the smartphone/electronics market from China. At the rate India is moving, it is likely to be a major check on China in the coming decades, but still has some major internal work to do before it is on equal footing. Reasoning for...\nChina is hurting more from the trade war than it pretends. Much of its prosperity is dependent on keeping good standing with potential trade partners, meaning Japan and South Korea may be able to use economic agreement to curb otherwise hostile behavior. While much manufacturing has moved away, China has managed to start a somewhat internally sustained economy. It has also made strides in its Belt-and-Road initiative, providing a lot of leverage to work with across the entire planet. China is also good at playing with soft power -- something the USA is experiencing the hard way and South Korea is seemingly affected by at its upper levels of government.

There is also an option major talks and/or announcements coincide with the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games in 2021 - if necessary. Since the trade talks have a long history, and the final agreement will likely have the shape of a \"RCEP+\" deal, there may not be as many topics open to negotiate. The RCEP deal has already been signed and will deliver a solid foundation of the additional negotiations on selected higher standards. The RCEP signature took place even under pandemic conditions, which underscores the value and the importance to all parties involved. As trade liberalization and the positive effects on trade volume will be viewed as a form of economic pandemic relief, especially with regards to Japan, there will be a large incentive to speed up negotiations to achieve the final agreement in a fast sequence to the RCEP (signature: 11/15 November 2020). The question whether India's final abandon of the RCEP in 2019 will have an influence on the three countries' bilateral respective trade relations with India and thus on the likelihood that a RCEP+/Trilateral agreement will achieve signature stage in the next months, must be further investigated.
