On the other hand, the trend seems rather flat (the average never went below 21% since the start of June), and there was no signal in it from restrictions on home working being lifted in England (which has the largest share of both the working population and homeworkers) on 19/07.

Yet, even if 1/4th of the workforce is currently on holidays, were to return to work now and not answer \"worked from home and didn't travel to work\", the number would not drop below 15%.

Before the analysis, the question (I will always start my analysis with a point 0 from now on). Worked from home does not define what that means. Is that 100% wfh, or wfh once per week? From the data, we can see the ONS look on a weekly basis, and ask wfh and didnt travel to work. UPDATE: There is another option there that asks for both wfh and travel in. This changes the outlook significantly from my original assumption that the question assumed going into the office at least once per week. 1.) Trend - % adults wfh has declined steadily since Feb 21, with a low of 18% recently. Data seems to indicate a steady point around 20% 2.) Target WFH population - This number has been debated a lot, and is affected by the definition of WFH (1x per week, everyday per week). Based on my current understanding of the question, I would say that even companies with full WFH principles forever (eg Twitter) would have a large % return to work once per week. I would put this at 10% of the population, and will be the target my estimate for long term trend from point 1. I see a transition from fully working from home to a hybrid model increasing. 3.) Timing - Data is until August. September is the end of school holidays, and will mark a point where a significant proportion of the work force (those with children) are actually able to return to the office a few days a week.
