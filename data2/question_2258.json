However this doesn't work when the proportion of positive specimens is so high, since you actually end up having to retest every batch. So it sounds like true capacity might have been reached. Given that there are probably only a few weeks (maybe less) until the peak, it's quite possible that capacity will only increase after the bulk of cases.

I was looking an Omicron's spike elsewhere and assuming a similar growth in New Zealand. Their other waves are so small that this isn't an accurate prior - both because the first numbers are smaller and because it means their population has less illness-produced immunity (which seems to be the more effective immunity against Omicron). As a new prior I want to look at a the percent of the population that has caught COVID in similar countries, assume some effectiveness of the vaccine and model out a spread to figure out the peak. New Zealand has only had ~6k cased per 1M people, Australia (a neighbor with a similar climate) has had ~116k, Japan (another island with a similar climate on the opposite side of the equator) has had 35k, Uruguay and Argentina (similar latitude) have had 233k and 192k respectively. The average of those is 144k. Let's assume the vaccine regiment New Zealand has had is ~70% effective (based off of https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2119270), that would mean that we could expect an uncontrolled outbreak to reach 43k people. If we model that in a normal exponential distribution growing at ~25% per day (current rate for last ~2 weeks) a total infected amount of 216k (144k per million * 1-0.7 for vaccine effectiveness * 5 (population of 5 million) gives us a peak day of ~23k, at which point this wave would have infected 118k people, and then we'd watch the back half of the curve.

That went to to 180k at its highest. The US had a base rate of around 120k, which hit 800k. Belgium 5-10k -> 52k.\nAustralia 3k -> 100k\nSouth Korea 3-6k -> 87k and still rising\nPoland 12k -> 44k\nSouth Africa 500 -> 22k These countries are not necessarily comparable in terms of demographics, vaccination rates, reliability of statistics or COVID control policies. But you can see that Omicron can lift the infection rate by 4 to 44 times the base rate of infections. That's a very wide range. The sharpest rise in a developed country from that list was in Australia, which had had very minimal infections before Omicron but had vaccinated around 80% of its population. It just goes to show that vaccinations do not prevent infections - only severe illness. New Zealand started with a base rate of 100-500 cases. It had a slightly better rate of vaccinations then Australia. If multiplying by only 4x, it should see 1200-1500 cases per week by the peak. But if its Omicron wave looks anything like Australia's (x33) it could go as high as 15k per week. If it looks like South Africa's (x44), it could go as high as 22k. New Zealand has a much smaller population than Australia or South Africa (respectively 5m, 25m and 59m). It has fewer big cities and appears to enjoy tighter social compliance with COVID restrictions. It seems less likely to experience the same extreme jump in cases as those countries. Another angle is to looking at how far cases are doubling and when the Omicron wave started. At the moment New Zealand's cases seem to be doubling every 4 days. Its Omicron wave began around 7 Feb with cases around 200, and 12 days later they reached 1,600, 200 X 2 X 2 X2 = 1,600, so three doublings in 12 days, i.e. doubling every four days). If the wave peaks after a total 4-5 weeks, which is what happened in the UK and South Africa late last year, there is time for another 3-4 doublings, maybe a touch more. Cases are currently 1,600 per day, so x2x2x2 gives us 12,800 cases. Another doubling gives us 25,600 cases (and the 'touch more' might bring us over 30,000, or even over 40,000). Jacinda Ardern therefore seems to be pretty on the money when she says there is a high degree of unpredictability, and that cases could peak between 10k and 30k per day.

We will see when this happens if test positivity % increases but the case count remains static.  Given we are seeing a doubling every 3 days or so, I'd expect to see 6000/day cases by next Saturday.

Country PM is very responsive to poll ratings, which are lowest currently on account of restrictions. So we can assume status quo until June. International border opening is also very cautious. Public follows rules and in biggest city Auckland there are many ethnicity-based clusters meaning that outbreaks can be contained.

The international modellers at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation have estimated that infections could peak at 80k per day but this would only correspond to around 11k confirmed and probable cases though the 95% confidence is wide (480 to 37k)\nhttps://covid19.healthdata.org/new-zealand\nAt the beginning of the outbreak this source had predicted that NZ would have 50k infections by today which was largely criticised within NZ.\nhttps://www.1news.co.nz/2022/02/04/kiwi-expert-explains-why-modelling-for-peak-omicron-cases-missed-mark/\nhowever looking further into the Institutes modelling their cases are bang on track for the 50k infections when you compare to the reported cases.\nNZ could do better than the modelling because it doesn't account for the public health measures associated with the red light setting of the covid protection framework. Nor does it account for the reduction of the eligibility time for boosters from 6 months to 3 months.\nAn interesting exercise is to take the omicron peaks from other countries and scale it to NZs population:\nAustralia (128k cases) to NZ: 25k cases (note similar in terms of very little prior infection, high vaccination, but Australia fully opened up)\nUK (182k) to NZ: 13.7k (have substantial prior infections, fewer boosters, opened up)\nSweden (41k) to NZ: 20k (very different strategies and vaccinations and winter)\nUSA (81k) to NZ: 12k (low testing rates, high previous infections)\nSouth Africa (23k) to NZ:2k (very low testing, social and economic issues, high prior infections)\nSingapore (6k not at peak?) to NZ: 5k (much higher density living but used to these kind of issues, higher vaccination, better public health measures and mask use, possibly a good comparison? note the long low delta peak)\nUAE (2.9k) to NZ: 1.5k (very high vaccination, very strong public health measures and mask use, amazingly they have kept omicron lower than their delta) I don't suspect that NZ will get as low as the very compliant countries such as Singapore or UAE, I don't think NZ will be as bad as Australia. @oracle100"], [33873, "2022-02-06T21:43:04Z", [0.05, 0.11, 0.24, 0.4, 0.17, 0.03], "I think given Omicron's ability to infect those with previous immunity to different variants either from vaccination or previous infection, I think the UK offers a relatively good model of how this will spread in terms of uncontrolled spread in a population. In the UK, the highest rate reached was ~2700 cases/million per day. For New Zealand's population of ~5 million, that translates to around 13,500 cases. However, Sweden and Denmark have both registered even higher case numbers on a per million basis, which would translate to 20,000 and 35,000 NZ cases respectively.  I think with no new restrictions, bin 4 is the likely high watermark, with bin 5 being slightly less likely but still possible. 40,000 may seem very unlikely but with no restrictions it could happen given virtually the entire population has only vaccine induced immunity. NZ policy at the moment is to remove travel restrictions by October [ https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/02/03/new-zealand-border-reopening-covid/ ]. If this is in an effort to stop the spread of Omicron, it seems naive to assume it will be effective, given how easily it's spread and the foothold it looks to have gained in NZ. In a couple of weeks we should know whether the current contact tracing and isolation have been effective and these travel restrictions still make sense but I doubt that they will be sufficient. I also think we'll have an idea by then if new restrictions are going to be introduced. So with that in mind my intial prediction is going to be that the higher bins will be reached, but I'll re-adjust based on reactions in the country over the next couple of weeks. I don't think looking at multipliers vs previous variants for the same country is very effective, particularly in this case, since New Zealand effectively locked out covid and had very few cases outside of quarantine facilities previously.
