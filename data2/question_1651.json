[1] There are currently two proposed solutions to the qualified immunity issue before Congress, one of these has entered the legislative process and was passed by the House after being introduced on June 8. [2][3]  In a perfect world scenario, the bill would become law on February 24, 2021. This accounts for the average of 263.57 days between introduction and signing. [4] But we know this is not a perfect world. Despite the groundswell campaign to end qualified immunity, it is unlikely that a Republican-controlled Senate will pass such a bill. Especially originating from a Democrat controlled House. Even if this was to happen, the President has expressed strong, unwavering support for the police which leaves in grave doubt that he would ever sign such a measure.

Police are base Republican voters and so are there supporters.   Trump is trying to shave off a enough of Biden's black votes to win several primaries, and McConnell wants to make sure that Republicans win a majority in the next senate.     Voters tend to vote against politicians they do not like rather than for politicians they like.   The Black Lives Matter movement is now a central issue with a lot of support in the coming election.  Republicans will alienate some of their base voters if they support this legislation.   The Republicans will also lose some swing voters if they fight attempts to repeal qualified immunity. Therefore, I suspect Republicans have concluded they can only lose votes in the general election if they support or oppose any legislation on this issue.  There are fewer swing voters than in the past.  Now the emphasis seems to be a lot more on exciting the base in order to increase turnout.  Carl Rove was famous choosing \u2013 and winning\u2014W. Bush\u2019s elections with this approach rather than trying to reach swing voters.   This has also been Trump\u2019s approach.  There are other powerful groups that want to keep qualified immunity who have not been discussed in the media.  I am a lawyer who worked as a criminal lawyer and as an insurance defense lawyer for many years.  States, cities and counties can insure for liability arising out of the use of excessive force resulting from negligent supervision and hiring in addition to federal civil rights statutes.   The insurance companies are a key source of funds for Republicans and a few Democrats.  They do not want to payout large awards.  Also, states, city and county governments do not want to pay higher premiums.    I believe insurance companies, states, cities and counties will have greater pull should their interests conflict with the officers' interests.  Qualified immunity is something I believe the average person would find ridiculous in its current form.  Namely,  in order for a police officer, sheriff\u2019s deputy, correctional officer, etc.,  to be found liable for using excessive force there has to be a pre-existing court decision stating the act of the officer constituted excessive force in nearly identical circumstances.   The Supreme Court in 2006 decided the officers had to have notice that a specific application of force was excessive before the officer could be liable.   It does not matter how obvious the application of force was excessive, if there is no case on point, the notice requirement has not been met.   The courts have also been very narrowly interpreting past cases to make sure they do not apply to the current case before the court.    This has turned a two step process: Was excessive force used? And, Is there a case on point?  into a one step process: Is there a case with an identical application of excessive force under identical circumstances?  The answer is almost always no.  Fortunately, there are some very conservative politicians, including Justice Clarence Thomas, who have a problem with qualified immunity as it currently exists.  Yet, police and their conservative supporters oppose the elimination and even the curtailing of qualified immunity.  The key is the word \"curtailing.\"  I really doubt there will be enough Republican senate votes to eliminate qualified immunity. In order for qualified immunity to be \"curtailed,\" whatever that means, several things must happen. 1) Curtailment legislation must pass the house.  This will happen because there are more than enough democrats to make that happen. 2) Curtailment legislation must pass the senate.   a) Right now the senate is 53 to 45, Republicans over Democrats.  There are two independents who caucus with the Democrats so it is really 53 Republicans  to 47 Democrats.       b) McConnell wants to keep his majority.  There are 33 senators running for six-year regular terms and two special elections so there will be 35 senate elections.  Twenty-three of these seats are held by Republicans and twelve by Democrats.  To keep control, McConnell can only lose three seats if Trump is re-elected and only two seats if Trump loses because a Democratic VP would vote in case of a tie.   All but eight Republican seats are considered safe, and the Alabama seat will certainly go to a Republican.  Therefore, McConnell needs at least five of the remaining eight Republican senators who are in tight races to keep control of the senate.   Three or four  Republicans in the current session will also have to vote in favor of any bill for it to pass, depending upon how Pence votes.  Moreover, thirteen Republicans will have to vote in favor of cutting off debate inorder to hold a vote.   Susan Collins, Martha McSally, Cory Gardner, Thom Tillis, Mitch McConnell, Joni Earnst, Kelly Loeffler, and Steve Daines are considered at risk.  There is also an open seat in  Kansas.   Based upon a quick review Collins, McSally, Loeffler, Gardner and Daines are far too far behind in the polls to have more than an outside chance of being re-elected.  However, the Republicans will win Alabama.  Therefore, it can be assumed that at best, the senate will have 49 Republican seats in the next session absent something very unusual.   In the remaining seats, Iowa, Kansas,  and Montana have very few African American voters.  The political culture in these states is also strongly Republican.   Kentucky is only about 8 percent African American and 86 percent white.   The African American vote might make a difference in Kentucky because the polls are so close.  Thus, the only Republican senators in a close contest with a large enough African American population to influence the outcome are Thom Tillis and Mitch McConnell. Tillis has expressed a willingness to eliminate qualified immunity.  In fact, I read some of his positions on race, which are unusual for a Republican.  He supports Black Lives Matter, anti-lynching bills and as speaker of the North Carolina house -- passed reparations for victims of North Carolina's eugenics program.   He is a Republican who will bend with the wind.    McConnell leads his opponent by one point.   However, McConnell is always unpopular in Kentucky, and he has won every senate race since 1984.   He also has the entire senate to worry about.  Senators Romney and Murkowski have also expressed some interest in supporting Black Lives Matter.   Yet, only Rand Paul and Thom Tillis have expressed any interest in \u201caddressing\u201d qualified immunity.   c) In order to pass the senate the bill must be approved by committee and then pass the full chamber.   A bill can pass the full chamber by unanimous consent, a voice vote or a recorded vote.  Of course, debate has to be terminated by a vote of 60 senators in order for any of the above to occur.   Finally, McConnell sets the calendar and can refuse to schedule a vote on any house bill.  I think the experience in the anti-lynching bill a few weeks ago is instructive.  The senate tried to pass a very uncontroversial antilynching bill by unanimous consent.  This would have had the effect of making every senator in favor of this bill, without a recorded vote.   One senator, Rand Paul, voted no.  I doubt he believes his stated reasons.  I think he is just trying to spare his party and Trump from taking  a position on an unpopular position with their base\u2014and potentially reducing Republican turnout.   Namely, he opposed the bill so other senators would not have to vote on it and -- more importantly-- so Trump would not have to sign it.     The senate could have scheduled a recorded vote but did not.  McConnell said it was tor two reasons: It would take too much time from other matters, and Rand Paul could still be convinced.  To me this is putting the best face on a refusal to pass a bill popular with the general public but unpopular with the base.  Why would the senate Republicans do such a thing?  As stated above, to make sure the base Trump voters (Hilary\u2019s \u201cdeplorables,\u201d i.e., racists)  are excited enough to turn out and vote.   Donald Trump has never in more than three years denounced white supremacists.  I will not spell out the reasons because they are many and anyone who regularly watches the news will already knows.  Well, one example: \"There were good people on both sides,\"  when in Charlottesville the white supremacists marched and a anti-white supremacist protester was murdered.  I think  Trump and perhaps several senators did not want to be put on the record and Paul, who was not up for election, stopped it.  I think it unlikely that a bill curtailing qualified immunity will emerge from the senate. Trump will not want to be put in the position of vetoing or signing the bill, and he will not want to force Tillis and himself to go on the record.  McConnell has a history of protecting vulnerable senators from making unpopular votes in their states, e.g., Susan Collins during impeachment.   3)  Trump does not want to alienate those white supremacists he refuses to criticize.   He also does not want to alienate police.   Trump has always had a \"base strategy.\"   And, his base includes deplorables who are fine with cops killing African Americans without consequences.   4)  Yet, the Black Lives Matter movement has acquired a lot of momentum.  Many years ago I read a book by Dick Morris who was a campaign strategist who helped win many close races for Bill Clinton, including the White House.  He said every so often a political issue becomes so popular it is like a cannon going off.  Once the cannon ball is in the air travelling at hundreds of miles per hour, that energy must be expended.  If you get in its way, you will be bowled over.  However, you can deflect the cannon ball's direction or even change its trajectory.  Sometimes, you can even change the trajectory enough that it destroys your political opponent who fired the cannon at you.  I understand the above is now dogma for all political consultants. In this case, I the Republicans will try to expend the energy by introducing a bill more to the liking of their base.  They have the only black Republican Senator very publicly working on an alternative to curtailing or ending qualified immunity, which he says is a non-starter.  \nNo doubt the Republicans are polling their base as we speak to see what  their base will find acceptable. For example,  Republicans  could eliminate choke holds, require better background checks of police, or they could require a database keeping track of incidents of excessive force and forbid the hiring of cops who were fired from another department.  This way the Republicans can protect their base voters: police officers, other pro-law enforcement types, insurance companies, state, city and county officials in red states\u2014and the deplorables.  I suspect an alternative bill is far more likely than eliminating or curtailing qualified immunity prior to the election.   \n"], [92008, "2020-06-15T02:28:32Z", [0.0], "The American people do not want to give politicians a free pass to break the laws of our country for their personal advantage.
