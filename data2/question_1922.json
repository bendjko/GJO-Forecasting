A few things up in the air still. This readme file at the github repository linked below shows the 806 historical LA deaths. What remains to be seen is if those deaths get backdated before the data is accessed on March 6th. The readme lists some of the retrospective death reporting, but it looks like not all of them get backdated immediately. https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data#data-modification-records If they're not backdated before the numbers get pulled we're very likely to be between 14k and 16k. If they do get backdated it's a bit more of a tossup. The week prior, the remaining two days in the timeframe (Feb 19 and 20) had 2,689 and 1,821 deaths for a total of 4,510 deaths. If the 806 deaths get backdated, there would be 4,147 deaths remaining this week to stay under 14k deaths. So the 26th and 27th need to report about 8% less deaths than the same days last week. That seems doable, but hard to know if it'll happen. I'd guess the chances of the 806 deaths being backdated by the time the data gets accessed to resolve the question are pretty good. But I have no idea if the next two days to be reported can stay 8% below the previous week, and I would lean toward it being a little unlikely. Combining those factors, overall I think there's a little higher chance of landing between 14k and 16k deaths.

In taking a closer look at the numbers over the last 4 weeks, though, we can see that there is a fairly regular weekly \"hump\" in the data, with a peak followed by three days of increasing decline, then the nadir to begin the next week. Over the three weeks prior to last week, the day following the peak is lower, but not by a lot, which gives us the \"hump\" shape of the data each week. Yesterday, however, the drop was very steep...of course last week, this pattern shifted a bit and the day after the initial drop (the second day after the peak) actually went up. BUT! That was following a fairly minimal drop, much closer to the three weeks previous to it. So! Given yesterday's performance, I look for the numbers to drop significantly today and tomorrow as well. I'm not going all-in on the >14K number, but I admit that it's going to be very, very close.

LA death review: https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/coronavirus/southern-california-coronavirus/death-certificate-review-leads-to-806-more-covid-19-deaths-in-la-county-since-december/2535231/ I've seen some suggest that the winter storm may be the reason for the uptick in cases and deaths, meaning that some deaths from last week could have been reported this week instead. That would mean last week's drop was larger than it should have been and the increase this week compensated for it. Hard to say if that's true, but seems plausible. If that's true then the trend in deaths should start to go back down again soon since deaths haven't dropped as much as case counts have yet."], [87827, "2021-02-25T13:03:56Z", [0.25, 0.7, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [50395, "2021-02-25T10:37:39Z", [0.1, 0.4, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [89038, "2021-02-25T10:20:46Z", [0.75, 0.2, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [89038, "2021-02-25T10:11:59Z", [0.3, 0.5, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [98259, "2021-02-25T07:49:11Z", [0.05, 0.95, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [28899, "2021-02-25T06:21:49Z", [0.4, 0.4, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [88452, "2021-02-25T04:14:46Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [87827, "2021-02-25T03:17:48Z", [0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "2447 deaths today, more than the same day in the previous week.

Even then, the drop was relatively modest. If you look at a chart of COVID deaths since the start of the year it looks like a weekly roller coaster bouncing between 1500 per day to 4500.  There is a slight downward trend over time.  Still there were 19486 deaths from 2/5-2/11.  The 7 day running total is shockingly consistent (see below for totals from 1/1 to 2/11) with the average change of + or - 384 (or 55 a day).  From 2/10 to 2/11 it was up 112.  The latest (2/11) 7 day total was 19468.  I expect this very slow decline to continue through 2/28.  The peak was 23549 on 1/14.  So we are currently down about 17% in one month and 14% in last 2 weeks.  17 days until the 28th, so with a 14% drop we would be at 16700.  But we could just as easily see things remain flat or increase slightly (due to new strains and Superbowl).  Over 20k seems less likely and under 16k seems excessively optimistic. 17615\n18301\n18375\n18532\n18573\n18753\n19315\n21345\n22195\n22712\n22688\n23460\n23531\n23549\n23344\n23470\n23411\n22825\n21090\n21498\n21727\n21690\n21638\n21636\n22126\n23469\n23043\n22863\n22680\n22093\n22103\n22204\n21666\n21603\n21352\n21373\n21250\n20740\n20296\n19908\n19356\n19468"], [218, "2021-02-12T17:12:49Z", [0.0, 0.2, 0.38, 0.38, 0.04, 0.0, 0.0], "Between Jan 22 and Feb 1st the USA added 29,268 to the death toll.\nBetween Feb 1st and Feb 11th the USA added 30,631 to the death toll.\nhttps://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths?country=USA~GBR~CAN~DEU~FRA Although it appears that the number of new hospitalization is falling by roughly 20%, the death toll is increasing at regular rate.  However, deaths are a laggard, so hopefully this will begin to see the effects of increased vaccinations, double masking, better compliance with preventative measures.   USA Deaths for 10 day periods:\nJan 1-11 = 28,492  (= 19,944 for 7 days)\nJan 11-21 = 34,103 (= 23,872 for 7 days)\nJan 21-31 = 31,009 (= 21,706 for 7 days)\nJan 31- Feb 10= 28,797 (= 20,158 for 7 days)\nhttps://ourworldindata.org/ People who are dying now got the virus roughly a month ago.  And the fatality rate sits stubbornly at 1.7%.  The period between 1/21 and 1/31 saw an increase of 1.53 million cases.  On a weekly rate that comes to 1,070,300 per week.  Applying the 1.7% fatality rate we would come to 18,195 if deaths lag cases by one month.  (The CDC has stated previously that it can range from 2 weeks to 8 weeks after the onset of symptoms.)   However, data is showing that vaccines prevent serious cases of Covid.  The vaccinated may get it, but the chance that they will die is greatly reduced.  As of now 14% of the population is vaccinated.  A month ago that number sat at 5.3%.  If we reduce the 18,195 by 5% we get 17,725.   I'm leaning primarily into the 18,000 - 20,000 (mostly because I am a pessimist by nature, and there WAS the super bowl super spreader event that will increase cases these next 2 weeks).  However, I'm hoping we will see the fatality rate fall as the vaccines prevent serious cases, yet I think it might be a bit early to see those effects if the lag in deaths is more than one month after onset of symptoms. So I'm hovering around tha 18,000 mark in my forecast.  Splitting on either side of that with a little sloping on the shoulders.  I can see I'm a bit more pessimistic than the crowd, but it just seems that the fatality rate is not responding as well as the case rate and we have a couple more weeks to go to see those effects.
