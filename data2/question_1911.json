There have already been a raft of op-eds calling on Biden to \u201chold Putin to account\u201d and \u201clay down the law\u201d but the reality is this meeting is a result of the fact that Russia has already grown too big and strong to push about any more \u2013 which has been Putin\u2019s plan for over a decade and the Geneva meeting is the culmination of that (successful) effort.   The palace in which the two men will meet is closed off so really sending correspondents to Geneva was a bit of a waste of time, as there is not even going to be a press conference afterwards, but you need the right dateline eh? What the meeting does signify is the start of a new phase of post Cold War relations that acknowledges the emerging markets have largely emerged and want to be dealt with on their own terms. It is more than significant that Biden\u2019s main message at the Nato summit a day earlier focused on the rivalry with China \u2013 a message that was somewhat less enthusiastically echoed by the EU leaders. And Putin takes China\u2019s President Xi Jinping\u2019s shadow into his meeting with Biden that significantly boosts his clout in the meeting.

Don't want to draw too much forecasting weight from this, but it may be worth remembering that Putin is a Judo enthusiast.  Anyone who's ever watched the sport at the Olympics or taken part in a bout or two will know that Judo involves a lot of assessment of strengths and weaknesses, manoeuvring your opponent into a position of \"imbalance\" and \"comparative unsteadiness\" in preparation for the finishing throw or trip. A lot of preparatory grappling, footwork and balance shifting goes into a bout, and this \"setting of conditions\" is by far the more important part (the actual finishing move is simply the logical output of the conditions the protagonists are able to establish). This feels kind of the same, and I wonder if Putin sees geo-politics through a similar lens (which may also be why he enjoys these little destabilising acts so much!). The point here is that, despite the outwards shows of disengagement and hostility, this could all be preparatory footwork and manoeuvring in build up for a close in grapple that Putin genuinely wants (but only on his terms).  Had he wanted to do real harm in the last 5 months since his puppet was kicked out of the power house I'm sure he could have, and the old Cold War philosophy of \"reading the actions they don't take as much as they actions they do\" is still alive and well for this question. I believe its entirely possible that Putin is taking actions that tilt the match in his favour without having his opponent not show up at all.  I also think Biden wants to be seen to be trying to set a different tone and believes that talk that goes nowhere is better than not talking at all (much as he is with his GOP colleagues back home).  Biden's possibly also quietly content that deniable Russian proxies are hacking into visible and \"voter impactful\" US infra (US voters have historically reacted hard to any rise in fuel prices) as a means of gather urgency and support for his broad and bold infrastructure bill (and as a beating stick for Republican opposition to it). Ergo, both sides have reasons to want to sit and are content to be seen to meet (but probably for very different reasons). COUNTER-ARGUMENT:  Its also entirely possible that Putin has no intention of actually engaging with this diplomatic moment in good faith and is taking contrary actions just to see how far he can push the US side before they walk away (and therefore get some measure of how much they want this bi-lateral now for a reset later on - playing the long game with the new admin).  To know whether this is true we'd have to understand what Putin wants / needs out of the bi-lateral NOW (as opposed to later on) and how confident he feels in getting it.

Given the historical behaviours, far more likely to be something foolish and counter-productive on the Russian side (re-escalation of Ukrainian hostilities, death of Nevalny etc.) which puts the whole prospect of a \"shake hands\" bilateral summit in deep freeze for 2021. In no way an impossibility or even an \"unlikelihood\", but at this moment it seems that a rather abrupt climb down on Putin's side (pulling forces off the border, giving Nevalny access to medical treatment as he demanded) demonstrates all this recent escalation was, in fact, just more trolling from the Troll Commissar.

Without behind the scenes control of the White House it seems Putin has switched to the more old school game of geo political chess, moving his pieces to force the other side into making moves, compromises and sacrifices they don't want to make but have to in order to keep playing.  In many ways this is nothing new and in many others its a refreshing return to something almost like the pre-Trumpian \"status quo\" (which Biden seems keen to embrace)! The issue raised in the article though is the shift in comparative power (both perceived and actual) that (currently) seems to sit in Russia's favour when compared to the last time we played this \"great game\".  With this said, Russia's \"one trick\" petro-centric economy and kleptocratic structural fragility remains: for all Putin's swan like outward presentation its hard to miss the furious authoritarian kicking (literally in some cases) required to keep him and his government gliding along the surface. That said, Putin's been here before and has shown a remarkable talent for survival in such environments. So the question remains: what would both sides get from a bi-lateral, and what will it cost them to have one?  It's against this key question (and the shifting \"cost / benefit\" equation as it will play out over the next few months) that I'm trying to focus my forecast on (blotting out some of the posturing and media noise in the process). If Biden really thinks he can talk Russia into an alternative course then he is more of a fool than I believe he and his advisors truly are, so what does he get from a bi-lateral if not that?  He's already declared that he cannot trust any \"agreement\" made with Russia in the current climate, so what does a show of negotiation, discussion and bi-lateral communications (with little hope of a change of course) get him?  Does his current hand of cards at the negotiating table mean he's likely to get what he wants? What might it cost him to pursue these more \"asymmetric\" objectives (home side support, international bon homie, future electoral prospects for him and his party at a time when \"being tough on Russia\" is increasingly popular but politically, economically and militarily tricky) and will he be willing to pay it? What does Putin want / need out of any form of \"Rus / US relationship\" and what does he need to do to get it?  Is it likely to come out of a bi-lateral meeting or other, more \"aggressive\" forms of communication (more hacks & political manipulation, more military shows of force, more pivoting of geo political \"centres of mass\" to the east etc.) that have served him so well thus far?  Is there anything going on behind the scenes or under the geo-political hood that will be more compulsive that he'd ever admit in public (light-touch sanctions in April 21: do more serious sanctions pose a credible threat to Putin and his power base?). More analysis required on this I think, and this week (with Nevalny protests, response to Russia's response and Putin's annual address) may be quite revelatory as to the answers.

Look at his calls with Xi and Putin': https://www.vox.com/22277212/biden-xi-call-china-russia-putin-foreign-policy\nClips from article:\n'Wednesday\u2019s conversation underscores one of the earliest themes of Biden\u2019s foreign policy: He won\u2019t back down against major US adversaries, but he won\u2019t just feud with them, either.\nBiden has so far followed a consistent blueprint for facing America\u2019s great-power competitors: The US will criticize and even punish China and Russia for human rights abuses, cyberattacks, and predatory economic practices, but it will also seek to cooperate with them when interests align.\nTake Biden\u2019s first call with Russian President Vladimir Putin in January. Biden pressed his counterpart on the poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny \u2014 suspected by many to have been an assassination attempt ordered by the Kremlin \u2014 as well as the government\u2019s arrest of hundreds of protesters who demonstrated in support of Navalny. Biden also affirmed America\u2019s support for Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty, which has been under threat since Russia invaded the country in 2014.\nBut those major policy disagreements didn\u2019t stop the US and Russia earlier this month, when the two countries agreed to extend the last remaining nuclear treaty between them for another five years. Though Secretary of State Tony Blinken released a statement praising the move, he also said that \u201cwe remain clear eyed about the challenges that Russia poses to the United States and the world.\u201d\n\u201cEven as we work with Russia to advance U.S. interests, so too will we work to hold Russia to account for adversarial actions as well as its human rights abuses, in close coordination with our allies and partners,\u201d Blinken added.\nBiden\u2019s isn\u2019t a fully confrontational approach, then, but rather a transactional one. There are many things on which Washington disagrees with Beijing and Moscow \u2014 and Biden will let them know about it \u2014 but there are also some areas where the adversaries can work together. Biden doesn\u2019t want to shut the door on making progress in those areas.\nIt\u2019s a fine message to send early on, but it\u2019s also a tricky situation to navigate over the long term. Should China further antagonize Taiwan, or Russia launch more cyberattacks against the US, for example, Biden will have less room to pursue cooperation with those countries. The possibility for plunging ties remains.\nBut UT Austin\u2019s Greitens believes calls like the one Biden just had with Xi could help mitigate such problems.\n\u201cClarity on the strength and nature of US concerns is important to avoid misunderstanding,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt\u2019s best for the US and China to try to clearly delineate where they can cooperate, where it serves both countries\u2019 interests, so that the cooperation is on a sound footing.\u201d"], [754, "2021-03-07T18:12:15Z", [0.03], ""], [22689, "2021-03-07T17:23:02Z", [0.0], ""], [80790, "2021-03-07T10:11:17Z", [0.06], ""], [94872, "2021-03-07T06:17:34Z", [0.03], ""], [58028, "2021-03-06T20:33:37Z", [0.2], ""], [98897, "2021-03-06T17:45:51Z", [0.03], ""], [33028, "2021-03-06T16:43:26Z", [0.2], ""], [2965, "2021-03-06T02:41:58Z", [0.05], "After sanctions on Nordstream II contractors, increasingly unlikely"], [88452, "2021-03-05T19:29:15Z", [0.51], "It takes two to tango, but Putin definitely is a dancer.\nhttps://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/austrian-ex-minister-karin-kneissl-joins-board-of-russian-state-owned-oil-firm-rosneft-r6s0f2qxb"], [2965, "2021-03-05T02:19:03Z", [0.05], ""], [98739, "2021-03-04T05:43:50Z", [0.1], ""], [96828, "2021-03-03T18:57:08Z", [0.03], "I hold NO given the political tensions.

First of all, these sorts of meetings, especially bilaterals as opposed to one-on-ones on the sidelines of a multilateral, are so politically significant that even the slightest change in the geopolitical landscape can affect their occurrence. The signal they send is so strong that everything has to be meticulously dissected before they can be pulled off. So we need to account for the political leanings of both sides (Biden & Putin), the domestic politics of both sides (US & Russia), and the state of international politics. Lots of moving parts. Additionally, our number might be skewed (come to think of it, all quantitative studies of American political behavior are going to likely be skewed for a while) by the...different approach to...pretty much everything during the Trump administration. Be that as it may, we can think a little bit about how these things normally occur and use them to get some sort of base rate. It looks to me like between 1999 and 2017, there were 5 bilateral meetings that would qualify for this question. That puts us at about one every four years. Importantly, Bush II and Obama both met with Putin during their first year in office. Clinton met with Putin during Putin's first year in office, and met with Yeltsin during his own first year in office. Note that although Bush Sr didn't visit with the Russian president in his first year in office, it may have had something to do with the fact that the country was \"transitioning\" from the USSR during the time. Trump didn't meet one-on-one with Putin until his second year in office but again...I gotta discount the ability to use anything that happened during the Trump administration to inform my thought about any other administration.  The Kremlin apparently requested a call with Biden, and received it within a week of his inauguration. That's not particularly illuminating, though the administration's approach to the relationship (aiming at developing a working relationship through START extension, for example) suggests that they are open to improving relations. Moscow likely feels the need to cultivate a better relationship as well, given they likely won't be able to manipulate the relationship as well as they had over the last four years, or at least they can expect the administration to be more prepared to speak strategically, as opposed to off the cuff.  Coronavirus is likely to put a damper on much international travel for the President, especially at his age. Putin is rumored to be battling Parkinson's. I think health concerns work against the likelihood of either traveling in the near future for a face-to-face (note that virtual meetings don't count for this question).

At the same time, the National Security Advisor's (Jake Sullivan's) press briefing this morning [1] names, in person, Russia and China as the direct adversaries for US foreign policy and national security to focus on.  Questioning from reporters drew out yet more condemnation of Putin's actions (election interference, chemical weapon poisonings in Europe, hacks and cyberwarfare, Nevalnys incarceration a day or so after Putins first conversation with President Biden etc.) and confrontational language (\"taking steps to hold Russia accountable for the range of malign activities it has undertaken...at a date and time of our choosing\"). Against this backdrop a bi-lateral meeting still seems a remote possibility at very least for the immediate term (6 - 9 months).  With Putin unlikely to suddenly cease playing the game in the way that has ideologically served him so well over the last four to five years, with a strong possibility of a Sarmat test launch at some point this year (https://www.gjopen.com/questions/1912-will-russia-conduct-a-flight-test-of-an-rs-28-sarmat-icbm-before-1-august-2021) and with plenty of European elections and Democratic events to mess with in 2021's calendar [2] it seems doubtful that Russia will mollify its current trajectory to the point where the US might believe that a bi-lateral meeting would be founded on an honest intent to reset foreign relations. Combine this with a much higher likelihood of highly targeted US sanctions being imposed in 2021: either responsively to fresh Russian malfeasance or retrospectively for the multitude of sins of the last unchallenged four years.  In the (likely) event of additional (and financially painful) sanctions being imposed on individual Russian power players in 2021 it seems unlikely Putin will want to meet his US counterpart in the same year for fear of being seen as capitulating to US pressure and rushing to meet with the US president to \"beg\" for the return of his piggy bank. Over Biden's (first?) four years a bi-lateral between the US and the Russian premiers (Putin or someone else [3]?) seems eminently possible.  Just not in 2021.

After President Biden has just tasked the intelligence community with providing an updated assessment of the Russian government's hostile actions toward U.S. interests over the last four years [1], it strikes me as unlikely that President Biden would want one of his first major meetings during his first year in office to be with Vladimir Putin.  In keeping with President Biden's expressed desire to return to normalcy, his first bilateral meetings are likely to be with close allies in Canada, Europe, and Asia.  A major goal of Putin is to be seen as a peer super power.  This sort of meeting would create that optic.  It is hard to see how President Biden would give this sort of benefit with nothing in return while asking our intelligence community to assess the damage to U.S. interests from Russia. President Biden and Putin would likely meet during Biden's first year, if not for the Coronavirus.

An ephemeral opportunity beckons.

A sensible starting point would be issues of immediate mutual concern, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath. And start listening to each other! If we should succeed in restarting a framework of arms control that includes aspects of strategic stability, all sides will need to actually listen to each other. Russians will need to understand our concerns on proliferation and next-generation capacities like hypersonic weapons and destabilizing cyber capabilities. We, in turn, need to hear their concerns on issues such as missile defense and long-range conventional precision weapons.

During the election, President Biden called Russia the biggest threat to the United States in the world [1]. Second, The Biden Administration has listed a COVID-19 response, racism, climate change, and the economy as their top priorities [2]. That means that foreign policy is not a top priority for the current administration and relations with Russia are an even lower priority than that. Finally, when the Biden administration pivots to foreign policy as a priority, their focus will be on repairing relationships with their top allies, including England, Germany, and France while trying to rebuild NATO's trust in America's commitment to the organization and repairing international treaties [3]. Thus, I predict a 0% probability of U.S. President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin holding a bilateral meeting in 2021.

"], [96367, "2021-01-23T11:02:36Z", [0.03], "The imminent START treaty extension date (Feb 21) is an interesting inducement for a meeting that I\u2019d missed in my original forecast, as is the announcement in the last 24 hours that Russia is, publicly at least, welcoming the incoming US President\u2019s endorsement of it (https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/biden-administration-approach-russia-about-extension-new-start-nuclear-treaty-n1255187). Think its important to remember that this is a pre-arranged extension to an already negotiated treaty: not a whole new negotiating position that would normally require more political engagement, meetings and pomp.  That\u2019s not to say the Russian side won\u2019t try to leverage something with it, and the political troll in Putin might try to force Biden\u2019s hand by demanding a bi-lateral early in 2021 in exchange for START\u2019s extension: a means of publicly showing power, forced cooperation and negotiating domination over the new (and publicly anti-Putin) US President whilst also forcing an implied snub of other, far less combative world leaders. It doesn\u2019t seem likely that Biden would give Putin this photo-op and political home run however, particularly given Russia\u2019s pushing of the treaty\u2019s boundaries and work outside of START on nuclear powered & hypersonic missile systems (https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-50927648 and https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/12/world/europe/russia-nuclear-accident-putin.html).  Given these behaviours it seems likely the US administration won\u2018t see START\u2019s extension as worth the political win Putin might try to engineer. The timings, optics and geo-politics are also important to consider.  It seems very unlikely that a special bi-lateral / state visit with Russia will be part of 2021\u2019s programme for the new US president (see previous analysis of special bi-laterals: https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1221522 and https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1221492). With so many other allies and less combative leaders to engage with as a political, economic and security priority, with Russia being the Trump associated boogey man in US politics right now and with Nevalny\u2019s recent arrest (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/18/alexei-navalny-calls-grow-for-release-of-arrested-russia-opposition-figure) it seems very unlikely that Putin\u2019s will be a one of the first hands the new US President wants to be seen shaking in anything other than a general (I.e. non-bi-partisan) setting. With the question explicitly discounting the far more credible \u201cone on one\u201d meetings in the sidelines of multi-lateral events (G20 in Italy, Oct 21 (https://www.g20.org/) and the delayed Munich Security Conference (https://securityconference.org/en/news/full/msc-2021-postponed/) being the obvious two) I think the probability of a specific, pre-planned summit or event (with the Helsinki fiasco still fresh in peoples minds) to be very low.

A chance that a meeting is ignored or not planned at all also seems low to me. Virtual meeting? Now there's a substantial NO resolution factor. With the COVID numbers going down or reaching stable rates early in the year and early in Biden's presidency, I see some reason to believe they will meet in person. However, you cannot exclude the possibility of deferring such a meeting to a later date or holding a virtual one. Processing these factors, I would say about 30% is a comfortable probability.
