It seems, however the source page takes the respective daily reports regardless of whether the reported ZERO new cases have been bases on a ZERO volume in tests, or not. This means, the more days there were in a state after 01 August 2020 with zero cases, the higher is the likelihood for this specific state to have an artificially low Rt rate in the most recent weeks, and most likely well below 1.00, even though the number of cases have been on the rise for the past two weeks. This is illogical, so I assume the calculation should have considered reporting days only where the testing volume is non-zero, to avoid any incentive for intentional manipulation and obstruction of testing procedures (for instance, in order to justify school opening, business as usual, travel and leisure etc etc)\nIf you compare e.g. New Jersey (0.95 as of 26 August 2020) and North Carolina (1.14), then cases in NJ on 13 August 2020 (656 cases from 27,674 tests) have been higher than on 23 July 2020 (242 cases from 18,709 tests), nevertheless Rt decreased over that 3 week-time span from 0.98 to 0.94 which is not explicable solely from time lags and other technicalities. The logic behind Rt is to indicate an accelerated spread, which obviously happened in this time frame. What NJ did experience was a frequent blank out in testing and/or reporting (if the data Rt.live uses are the accurate and official ones...): \n25 July 2020 (no tests, no reported new cases)\n28 July 2020 (no tests, no reported new cases)\n01 August 2020 (no tests, no reported new cases)\n04 August 2020 (no tests, no reported new cases)\n09 August 2020 (no tests, no reported new cases)\n16 August 2020 (28,803 tests, 13(!) reported new cases)\n20 August 2020 (27,495 tests, 100(!) reported new cases, less than a third of previous day's report)\n23 August 2020 (no tests, no reported new cases) Before 18 July 2020, there has been only ONE occasion in which figures failed to come in or were illogical, namely on 11 May 2020 (113,486 tests, no reported new cases), so my best guess is that this phenomenon is closely linked to the transfer of control from CDC to HHS around 20 July 2020, and somebody is doctoring the figures now.\nUnsurprisingly, the figures look differently for North Carolina, where the number of cases has risen until 18 July 2020 (2,481 cases from 35,169 tests) and are now slightly declining (e.g. 1,729 cases from 21,233 tests on 22 August 2020), and still NC has a Rt rate of 1.14, way above the 1.00 threshold.\nThe only difference I see is:\nNorth Carolina, as it has been a hot spot for the whole of August, had only one occasion where reported cases and testing volume was ZERO, namely on 12 August 2020. I haven't gone through all of the states' figures but it looks like the currently low number of states with an Rt rate of less than 1.0 are an artifact from the wish list of the current WH administration; my only explanation. However, if testing starts to improve and, most of all, continues from now on without ZERO reporting days, there are many states that may see their Rt rate rising again, just because of a frictionless data flow. I consider every state with a current Rt of 0.95 or higher to be eligible ending up above 1.00, so from today - even in a very short time frame - the number of states could rise from 17 to 30 from my point of view, or even higher to the next bin starting at 31.\nThe WH's rationale behind doctoring the figures seems clear. It's all owed to campaigning.\nWhen Rt s rise across states, POTUS will argue, that everything was \"beautiful\" until governors (mainly democrats, allegedly) \"messed up the school reopening\".

I will adjust probabilities on the high end lower than the low end simply because I believe people are pretty quick to respond to changes in the numbers these days so the number of states would seem more likely to decrease than increase (again, just my intuition working here).

The R naught is not something that is widely tracked (compared to new cases or deaths in absolute numbers). But given the existing state of 38 states higher than 1, layered against (i) rising case numbers nationally and rising hospitalizations says the virus is still spreading, (ii) despite the rising case numbers, states are trending towards reopening. Pause orders are not effective because it simply maintains the status quo- which in a rising COVID environment, does nothing to reduce the R naught, absent any additional countermeasures and (iii) mask orders are not yet widely in place with states with the biggest spread. If we are not staying home, increased mask use is the only thing we can layer on to effectively bring the R naught down. There is good science behind it (I'm not debating whether the mask protects the user or the people around them- it is simply true that there is a strong correlation between increased mask use and reduction of any infectious spread). Even a mandate at this point may not work given the politization of use. Now back to the buckets. 24 of fewer is a zero possibility. In 6 weeks it is impossible to imagine 14 states with R naughts above 1 to bring down the spread. More infections are happening today which means numbers for the next 3-4 weeks will only go up. Immediate action will only bring the numbers down in 4-6 weeks. And that depends on widespread adoption (of masks) because there are no other countermeasures available. Then I just looked at the remaining buckets to rank them among each other. Given the trends, I think it's likely that more states will experience increased spread. But that the same time, states are trying to limit spread as much as possible so, hopefully it won't be rampant. So I placed the greatest weight to 2 buckets- making sure to allocate more than 50% because that is what I think is the likely scenario. Then I just allocated between the two, again on a relative basis. I think it is more likely that with the summer and the continued to desire to re-open until it becomes painfully obvious that we cant, that the number of states with an increased R naught will grow. Lastly, weighing the trend today against the remaining 2 buckets, I allocated the remainder on a relative basis.
