More pressure on SEC to approve.\n- US regulation is medium/long term positive: remember, by default capital is scared of crypto and stays on the sidelines, so any reasonable regulation = acceptance = $ = marketcap. It was looking dicey this weekend, but the various competing bills appear to be resolving in favor of \"reasonable\" legislation: crypto is a golden goose for tax revenue, and nobody wants to kill that.\n- more companies and funds are buying crypto - and we're not seeing *any* companies reduce their holdings or exit.\n- capital continues to \"come over\" from gold ($10T). \"bitcoin = digital gold\" meme continues to gain steam e.g. regularly mentioned by strategy people at Fidelity, Goldman, etc. In the next phase, we'll start to hear crypto mentioned when the discussion topic is gold. For example, https://www.google.com/search?q=gold+investment is starting to show news articles about Bitcoin. The next phase after that, gold starts dropping (substantially) and \"gold bugs\" start capitulating - that's outside this forecasting window.\n- altcoins continue to strengthen: DeFi continues to gain respect and silicon valley insiders are bullish on legitimate uses for NFTs, driving $$$ investment. Altcoins are smaller marketcap, but drive excitement. The scams and meme-coins are losing attention, which makes \"room\" in the media for legit tokens that have provide infrastructure and utility to real applications.

More dollars invested equals more market cap. That's why it's often called a \"store of value.\" The crypto market is highly correlated with the broader equities market and global investor sentiment. Given COVID recovery unknowns and complex politics, assume volatility. Crypto is enjoying secular growth: previous metals investors allocating 100+B to crypto, the potential for near term US ETF approval (enabling millions of consumers to allocate 100s billions in retirement accounts), ongoing new offerings from large instructions including Goldman Sachs, etc. Venture capital is pouring into DeFi which in turn is drawing capital eager to access new products, especially lending. NFTs were goofy in \"version 1\" but in fact are a real revolution in digitizing ownership, especially digital rights - again drawing awareness and capital. I believe there will be a big COVID resurgence in the fall (easy prediction given variants, low vaccination rates and some amount of vaccine-escape) which will impact world economies but then quickly force western governments to inject capital (a.k.a. print money) and scare fiat holders to increase allocation into inflation protected asset classes. Interestingly, big dollar holders are struggling to store their dollars (banks refusing large deposits, negative interest rates etc) and crypto may seem attractive to companies like Apple. Crypto has ongoing risks: at any moment (or never) there could be a \"run in the bank\" with tether prior to USDC/etc replacing it. Very large \"whale\" investors could manipulate the market (as it appears they did in this spring's crash).  Regulation appears to be neutral: on one hand, it can create short term headwinds. OTOH, regulation makes crypto appear safer to investors and their draws more capital. Crypto is still dominated by Bitcoin and Bitcoin price influenced heavily by halving events. That periodicity isn't telling in this case: on one hand, we could be at the top from the most recent halving, on the other hand, history suggests that topping should exceed $125,000. Finally, it's worth looking at buyers and sellers. As above, there appears to be large and growing pool of buyers ready to buy. Anecdotally, traders seen to be excited by the low $20,000s which implies a floor above that. If we look at the crypto sellers, two thirds of crypto is held by long term HODLers under no pressure to sell. https://insights.glassnode.com/bitcoin-supply-distribution/ - my sense is that this a neutral effect: it won't stop a crash from happening but also doesn't create heightened risks of one happening (by comparison to an asset held mostly by retail investors). Even you sum it up, my sense:\n- crypto remains correlated to Bitcoin which remains correlated to the stock market.\n- if I had to pick a floor, I'd say $22000 (0.93T market cap) but of course it could crash further especially in a global financial crisis e.g. war (e.g. Russian cyber attacks on the US escalate to cyber war, causing widespread disruptions)\n- realistically, the Dec ceiling would be $100,000-200,000 both safely above $2.5T (I'm ~55% invested in selected real estate, ~8% cash and ~25% in crypto, roughly spread by market cap, overweighting selected \"utility\" altcoins and ignoring a few, including meme cryptos & pump/dump nonsense)"], [45594, "2021-07-11T08:14:06Z", [0.1, 0.3, 0.2, 0.3, 0.1], ""], [86367, "2021-07-11T03:31:35Z", [0.16, 0.25, 0.24, 0.22, 0.13], ""], [48709, "2021-07-11T01:11:55Z", [0.0, 0.28, 0.46, 0.26, 0.0], "Going with the crowd."], [56, "2021-07-11T00:08:41Z", [0.04, 0.12, 0.22, 0.26, 0.36], "I'm using Bitcoin as a proxy and ballpark the market caps to Bitcoin price at roughly $20,000, $32,000, $44,000, & $56,000.  if we do historical prices, it captures a lot of the variability, but I don't think the probabilities are so good.

Really crypto doesn't have much for fundamentals to look at so all you can look at is the technical pattern.  Crypto really isn't a non-correlated asset to the stock market like a lot of people claim. It behaves a lot more like a growth stock of a tech company that has never made a profit like uber or Netflix or doordash or we work. When the stock market crashes crypto tends to drop as well. So as stagflation hits the economy over the next 6 months I expect crypto to suffer. It's also important to realize that much of the cryptocurrency value has been leveraged. Many people have taken out loans against their Bitcoin value, so if Bitcoin drops at a certain point this will cause increased selling because people will effectively have margin calls and will need to cover their loans.  Also, crypto does not have market stops like the stock exchange does. The stock exchanges will halt trading if the market drops a certain amount and allow panic to cool off.
