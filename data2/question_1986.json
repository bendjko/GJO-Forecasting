The announcement on Thursday was a surprise to oil markets, which had anticipated output to hold steady. But it wasn't an unpleasant developent: while supply increases often push prices down, oil actually rose after the news of this apparent optimism. The deal between OPEC members and their allies, collectively called OPEC+, call for production to increase progressively in May, June and July.

I'm not sure how to consider the 1,000 tb/d recovery. Is that included in OPECs phasing of 2,000 tb/d? Considering SA's quota is just below 9500, it indicates to me that the 1,000 tb/d is included in the total 2,000. Either way, the 600 tb/d increase vs. April seems to be too low of an estimate.

These were lowered for COVID by 9.7M total May-July, 7.7 August-December, and 7.2 since January. Saudi Arabia also did additional cuts of 1M in February-April to prop up prices and as a goodwill gesture to other OPEC members (according to them), so their quota is lower than normal and their actual production is 1M below their quota. Their current quota is 9.12M, their April production was 8.132. As of the last OPEC meeting, they're planning to phase out their 1M voluntary cut over the next 3 months (https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/oil/051021-opec-crude-oil-production-rises-in-april-on-surges-from-iran-russia-platts-survey). Per the current agreement Saudi Arabia's quota will be 9.495 for July 2021 (https://www.opec.org/opec_web/static_files_project/media/downloads/15th%20ONOMM%20-%20Production%20adjustments%20table.pdf).  I assume they'll stick to their stated plan to ease the voluntary cut, so the questions are will OPEC's quotas stay as planned, and will Saudi Arabia comply with them? Compliance is more straightforward, Saudi Arabia has been something of an enforcer for OPEC quotas, and have been very good with quota compliance in the past few years. For 2017 to March 2020 they overproduced in 7 of 39 months, with all the months being at the end of 2018 before their quota was raised the next January after being stagnant for a year and a half. Considering their recent stances on sticking to quotas and taking a voluntary cut themselves, it's not very likely that they'd violate their quota. They probably wouldn't need the excess revenue since the breakeven price for their budget is going down as the economy recovers (https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/oil/042221-feature-lower-gulf-fiscal-oil-breakeven-prices-seen-supporting-easing-of-opec-cuts), and it would look a bit hypocritical. That said, more money is always nice and they could say they're entitled to it because of their recent cuts, or they could boost production in response to a faster than expected economic recovery if that recovery isn\u2019t reflected in the quotas. I'd say 85% chance of compliance. When they've been compliant historically they\u2019ve averaged production at 97% of the quota as well, so they should have some wiggle room for small changes in demand should the need arise. More difficult is will OPEC\u2019s quotas be adjusted. What makes it so difficult is that I don\u2019t know what exactly went into the quotas to begin with, so I can\u2019t say if something is or isn\u2019t weighted properly. The quotas are based on projected demand for OPEC crude, and the most recent adjustment was upward by 200k b/d in response to lower projected demand for non-OPEC crude (https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news/2213765-opec-lifts-forecast-call-on-its-crude), so their global oil demand projection from all sources was unchanged as of early May. One of the main points of uncertainty mentioned by Saudi Arabia is the COVID outbreaks in India and Brazil, and India recently agreed to purchase its regular volume in June apparently in response to price cuts from Saudi Arabia (https://www.reuters.com/world/india/exclusive-india-offers-lift-regular-saudi-oil-volumes-june-after-may-cuts-2021-05-07/), as part of a longer saga with deep cuts in May purchases. What that suggests though is that forecasting demand isn\u2019t the same as forecasting economic conditions since demand can be stabilized, partly by price adjustments to account for economic circumstances and partly by the long contract terms (the article also mentions the purchases being agreed upon on an annual basis, making it hard for refiners to shift away from Saudi Arabia as a supplier). On the flip side, greater than expected demand can be met through spot purchases, and annualized contracts don\u2019t prevent additional buying, so a better-than-expected recovery elsewhere may be more impactful. The approach from OPEC led by Saudi Arabia has been \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-27/opec-prepares-for-meeting-amid-troubling-india-virus-surge) and their recent adjustment was very modest, so I wouldn\u2019t expect a dramatic change in quotas in the coming weeks with that attitude. That said its still possible, their last agreement was before Indian cases started decreasing and upward revisions in response to demand likely wouldn\u2019t be contested much within OPEC.  Something to watch will be May's numbers, especially to clarify whether the +25/35/40 mentioned in the article on their voluntary cut refers to total capacity added back or just the cut independent of quota increases. The June 1 OPEC meeting will be when plans are made for the next two months (June/July), they don't seem to adjust numbers for sooner than that most likely because orders are placed at least that far in advance, so that'll be an important report to check on. Whether the 200k b/d upward revision in OPEC projected demand results in a quota change will also be something to watch.

Because it's voluntary I think they're less likely to continue with it by July, and they've indicated they intend to end the cut by July. I'm putting most weight on bucket 4, which is just under their announced quota. As the largest producing member of OPEC I think Saudi Arabia has the most incentive to abide by the quota, which is a maximum allowed if I'm understanding it correctly. But I'm leaving about a 1 in 5 chance in over 9,500 in the event that the quotas get revised up or they overshoot. I'm also leaving a little under 1 in 5 chance that they maintain their voluntary reduction. I think chances are pretty slim that they fall in the 8.5 to 9 category, I would guess by July they'll either stick to their 1 million barrel a day reduction or have eliminated it as opposed to being in the middle of phasing it out.

This means that as a baseline, monthly averages will be slightly more accurate for monthly forecasts than yearly averages.\n2) Looking at historic Saudi oil production on aggregate (https://www.eia.gov/opendata/qb.php?category=1039874&sdid=STEO.COPR_SA.M) it has been relatively plateaued since 2016 after a gradual rise since the early 2000's, so restricting my data analysis to only post-2016 data.\n3) By breaking down the July oil production from 2016-2019, disregarding July 2020 as they had instituted production cutbacks in the months prior (https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/12/opec-and-allies-finalize-record-oil-production-cut-after-days-of-discussion.html), we see that the probability of Saudi Arabia producing more than 9.5 mb/d during regular production is 79%, with the mean July production being 10.27 mb/d.

While vaccinations are speeding up across the world, most of the world's population won't be inoculated for a while.

TL;DR Demand for crude will be slow to pick up, and that's assuming no new negative developments   \" So, if the current cuts continue, even with moderate increases, we would still see production fall into the 8-8.5 mb/d range, with it being very unlikely (on the order of 1-3%) that production falls below that range.  According to Financial Post (https://financialpost.com/commodities/game-of-chicken-the-saudis-and-russians-can-wage-an-oil-war-for-a-long-time-but-at-a-huge-political-cost?video_autoplay=true), Saudi Arabia has more than enough wiggle room to keep the cuts going for as long as they feel that COVID is suppressing demand. While Wall Street Journal (COVID-19 slashed Carbon Emissions. Now They're Climbing Again.) reports that emissions and carbon consumption are back on the rise, and the oil prices (noted above) are rising as well, the worldwide case against COVID is worsening, meaning we could just as easily see things turn back around. SO, my prediction is that it is the most likely scenario that the cuts are still in place through July, 2021, making it the most likely scenario that production is in the 8-8.5 mb/d bucket. However, the next most likely scenario is that the game of chicken between Russia and Saudi comes to a halt and both countries ease restricitons, which would cause Saudi production to shoot up closer to the historic mean, meaning the next most likely scenario is that July production falls in the >9.5 mb/d bucket. ."], [26642, "2021-04-20T14:35:21Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.9, 0.1], "They may decide with Biden's halt to the Pipelines bringing oil sands oil south to continue to up the economic pressure on these oil sources to drive them out of business.
