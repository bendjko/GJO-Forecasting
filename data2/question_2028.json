I found this article at https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/10/1932.  Searched for 'simultaneous hurricanes' 'interacting hurricanes' etc on Google Scholar without much luck.  I suspect that formation in a given region is not independent assuming that hurricane formation is driven by thermodynamics and that within a given geographic area there is only so much potential energy available for formation - at a given time.   Not a scintillating insight but it is plausible.  This sounds like a great atmospheric physics question for someone at UC Boulder involved in the annual hurricane forecasts.

I'm surprised so many people seem to think there will be (by historical standards) tons of hurricanes this year. Maybe I'm missing something.

Number of named storms and overall activity has generally outpaced predictions which tells me that the models are not quite accounting for some pieces of data when they're making the predictions of \"above average\".
