There does not appear (reported) to be any threat form the National armed forces to forge a coup.\nAbiy Ahmed does appear to have an impossible task but given the lack of any other credible leadership, I will suggest that he remains in power for the foreseeable future. https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2021/7/28/with-a-new-mandate-abiy-can-usher-a-new-era-of-hope-in-ethiopia  https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/plough-and-kalashnikov-ethiopia-after-tigray  https://www.africanews.com/2021/07/11/another-five-year-term-for-ethiopian-prime-minister-abiy-ahmed//  https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/ethiopia-abiy-ahmed-landslide-victory-fractious-polity/  https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20210702-a-regional-capital-falls-and-so-does-the-stature-of-ethiopia-s-leader-and-its-military  https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/africaatlse/2021/07/06/ethiopias-election-is-a-coronation-of-abiy-ahmed-before-the-polls/  https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20200225074153900\n"], [100653, "2021-07-31T07:56:29Z", [0.04], ""], [34815, "2021-07-31T06:02:46Z", [0.0], ""], [89038, "2021-07-30T21:43:58Z", [0.06], ""], [1333, "2021-07-30T18:33:39Z", [0.49], ""], [100184, "2021-07-30T17:58:18Z", [0.1], ""], [1333, "2021-07-30T17:09:57Z", [0.5], ""]]}
