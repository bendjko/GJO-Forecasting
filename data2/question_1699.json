A difference of priorities exists not just between Republicans and Democrats but between GOP senators and the White House. Leading Republicans including John Cornyn (Texas), Chuck Grassley (South Carolina), and John Thune (South Dakota) have dismissed many of the President\u2019s policy preferences for the new coronavirus aid package as little more than a joke. Part of the divide stems from the fact that senators on both sides are increasingly concerned with solving America\u2019s testing problem before tackling the issue of additional relief. Sen. Lamar Alexander summarized their position: \u201dMy view is, we should do whatever we need to do to make sure we have adequate tests. All roads to open school, opening, going back to work, child care go, lead through testing.\u201d  This renewed focus comes as the U.S.\u2019s largest laboratory warns it will be almost impossible to increase capacity to cope with demand for COVID tests going into the Autumn flu season.

After all, in almost every other developed country, the coronavirus has all but disappeared.   Democrats will have an easy time blaming them  for a very different and tragic result.    McConnell is very realistic in these situations, and he wants to keep as many Republican senate seats as possible. He will be willing to suffer a short term loss on this issue for the long term gain of increasing the odds of keeping the senate in Republican hands.  He will agree to whatever he needs to in order to reduce the negative economic effects of the coronavirus.   Thus, he needs to do two things:  reduce the daily financial strain of the unemployed, and get as many of unemployed as he can to return to work.    I think the most likely outcome is that the coronavirus unemployed will receive a weekly amount subject to cap that will likely be a percentage (perhaps 100%)  of  a workers previous weekly earnings or $600, whichever is less. It is highly likely any extension will pass before benefits run out for the reasons stated above.  If the second option was $600 or LESS per week, this question would be a no brainer.   I could see the Republicans insisting on a small \"up to\" cap of maybe $500 or $400 per week.  Yet, things are real bad, and the Republican's are rightly getting the blame.
