As a populist with massive approval ratings, AMLO assumed that increased turnout could only strengthen his chances. (Past presidential and midterm election turnout for reference)\n- 2018 (Presidential)   - 63.43%\n- 2015 (Midterm)         - 47.72%\n- 2013 (Presidential)   - 63.08%\n- 2009 (Midterm)         - 44.6% Unfortunately for him, he did not have the congressional votes needed to get such a referendum to take place in an election year and had to settle for a constitutional change allowing a 2022 recall referendum. \n(Though briefly while his approval numbers lagged in April 2020, the opposition promoted moving it up to 2021 as they saw his lack of popularity as an opportunity to help their midterm chances. His approval ratings subsequently shot back up to the 60s and I was unable to find mention of such a referendum again in my research.)  Thus in the fall of 2020, AMLO chose a new vehicle to increase turnout. This came in the form of a new referendum (hereafter \u201cprosecution referendum\u201d to distinguish from the initial \u201crecall referendum\u201d) on whether or not the government should pursue corruption charges against the previous 5 presidents of Mexico.  AMLO assumes this prosecution referendum will achieve the goal of increasing turnout, as his massive 2018 campaign win was also based on uprooting the corruption of previous administrations.  Thus, if the goal of the recall referendum on his presidency is achieved via the prosecuting referendum, there is no need for AMLO to attempt to push through the constitutional change required for the recall to take place in 2021. If AMLO continues to see the prosecution referendum as serving his purposes, then there is little reason to suspect the recall referendum will take place this year.   I give a 5% chance of the recall referendum taking place due to the volatile nature of politics in the times of COVID. Mexico has the 4th most COVID deaths in the world. Public sentiment could sweep against him if their numbers continue to be high if vaccines are not distributed efficiently, if corruption within the health system is revealed, or if any number of complications arise.
