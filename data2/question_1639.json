I changed them to reflect what happened in June...... and I didn't have to use my gut as much this time. There is EVEN MORE evidence of a positive now than when I wrote this. When I wrote this I was biased that China would be the aggressor too. Not true the last three weeks.* I applied the ACH method to this question last week. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_competing_hypotheses \"In researching the history of Chinese aggression, it is evident that while posturing and defense build-up has been common, there has been very little in the way of direct attacks or limited engagements in the past three decades. In the eyes of author Tom Doctoroff, China\u2019s bark is worse than its bite and \u201cgiven an adolescent economy and an immature body politic, China must focus on domestic imperatives\u201d (Doctoroff, 2013). It is the job of the analyst to identify any judgmental biases \u201cwhich are often systematic rather than random, in a certain direction\u201d (Kam, 2004). \u201cPrediction is extremely difficult and is likely often to be erroneous, particularly when it refers to international relations and military affairs\u201d (Kam, 2004). Keeping these things in mind when applying logic to this situation and following Heuer\u2019s method of giving the most weight to arguments that compete against the obvious conclusions derived from available evidence, it was easier to identify signal from noise. Relevant variables that could have been overlooked when giving the most weight to the obvious become more noticeable when giving the most weight to the argument. This was of great importance when evaluating this problem set. There is abundant evidence that an engagement of some sort would happen between the PRC and India. If Heuer\u2019s method of giving the most weight to information that weakens a hypothesis had not been applied, an analysis concluding that a conflict was in the future for them may have been reached. However, these hypotheses were easily argued against when the most weight was given to the information that weakened the engagement hypotheses. In fact, these weakening arguments turned into lynchpins, and two out of three lynchpins supported a political outcome. The assessment reached in this analysis is that there will be a political solution to the PRC-India Crisis\" Daveinsea INTEL401 May 30, 2020 Got a 97% on the paper and a 98% final grade in the class.\nBUT, I WENT 100% WITH MY GUT HERE ON GJO......

It seems highly unlikely that there will be deaths resulting from fists or blunt weapons, although the forecast needs to be adjusted for the unlikely scenario of a lucky strike to the head. The recent border disputes have started since XJP and Modi came to power (2013 for XJP, 2014 for Modi). Both are seen as nationalists and strongmen who want to build their internal base up while maintaining a strong exterior to the world. This mentality has fueled the disputes over the past 5 years, although stopping short of ordering troops to attack each other with non-blunt weapons to prevent a regional war. Border disputes started in 2013 when XJP took power and wanted to exert control over China's military through a show of force (https://www.theatlantic.com/china/archive/2013/05/are-china-and-india-about-to-fight-over-their-border/275518/). 2014, 2015, 2017 clashes seemed to be about small incursions from construction equipment into disputed territory and usually ahead of Indo-Sino summits.  In 2020, China has ramped up its national security policies. All other nations except for US have not reacted strongly to the new nationalistic push by XJP. If Modi continues to stay on the sidelines, I do not believe that this clash will result in any fatalities as the orders from the top will continue to keep the troops in check.

I think it is notable that 1 Indian soldier was killed every 3 days from 2005-17(1) in other conflicts but reportedly not a single one on the border with China despite 2017 and 2014 skirmishes (and many more unreported skirmishes).  I think the chances of the PLA reporting the death of one of their soldiers is low, this last happened in 2016 when two peacekeepers were killed in south sudan(2). People within China reacted badly and the CCP is known to minimise bad news events (of course we hear a lot more about the world than people in China would but they cant report a soldier from the PLA has been killed to the world and not have people inside China find out). 1/ https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/every-third-day-1-soldier-of-indian-army-killed-in-line-of-duty-for-last-13-years/articleshow/62511387.cms\n2/ https://qz.com/africa/728566/china-reacts-to-the-death-of-two-peacekeepers-in-south-sudan-with-grief-and-rage/\n3/ https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/china-and-india-move-troops-as-border-tensions-escalate#maincontent"], [60695, "2020-05-29T19:12:14Z", [0.7], ""], [691, "2020-05-29T19:05:05Z", [0.25], ""], [84880, "2020-05-29T18:57:00Z", [0.45], "It has happened before, it can happen again, times are complicated now, then again when haven't been times been complicated...?
