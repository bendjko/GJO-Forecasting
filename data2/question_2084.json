The tension over the Dam is philosophical and rhetorical so far, and from what I have read the downstream countries of Egypt and the Sudan are seeking legally-binding assurances and appealing through the African Union and UN Security Council (albeit without much success at the moment). Upstream, Uganda is sympathetic to the plight and Ethiopia does not appear to have much backing - therefore Egypt (and probably the Sudan) would need to be the aggressors and this would likely detract from the political support they need longer-term. The incentives don't seem to align. Furthermore, I'm not aware of any recent skirmishes or military tensions that could flare up or get out of hand. Finally, the actual on-the-ground consequences are likely to be longer-term so lack an acute trigger that could drive military action. Against this, I understand that there are domestic pressures in both Egypt and Ethiopia that could 'benefit' both governments in unifying their populations. Escalating the threat of military conflict could therefore help domestic politics and also energise external parties to overcome their reluctance and mediate. I therefore see a small risk that such posturing results in a skirmish with at least one fatality, or alternatively that a military intervention to disrupt the dam results in inadvertent fatalities.\n"], [691, "2021-07-26T19:15:21Z", [0.01], ""], [6425, "2021-07-26T17:14:55Z", [0.9], ""], [83135, "2021-07-26T17:12:02Z", [0.5], ""], [101908, "2021-07-26T12:49:53Z", [0.0], ""], [87571, "2021-07-26T11:59:59Z", [0.01], ""], [85377, "2021-07-26T10:38:48Z", [0.01], ""], [97801, "2021-07-26T10:29:04Z", [0.03], ""], [92079, "2021-07-26T03:30:05Z", [0.0], ""], [52872, "2021-07-25T22:32:21Z", [0.25], ""], [101970, "2021-07-25T19:43:34Z", [0.03], ""], [101165, "2021-07-25T17:19:18Z", [0.01], ""], [22689, "2021-07-25T16:34:26Z", [0.0], ""], [25295, "2021-07-25T16:10:46Z", [0.01], "Very unlikely.

As a point of interest and potential responsibility the site of the dam was identified by the US Bureau of Reclamation in a survey of the Blue Nile River between 1956 and 1964. The arguments concerning Ethiopia\u2019s ability to turn off the filling of the reservoir behind the dam is of little consequence as given the current stage of construction, the filling cannot be stopped as it is filling due to the rainy season which has begun and will continue until September. According to Manchester University's Mohammed Basheer, more water is entering the dam site than the volume of water that can physically pass through the two open outlets in the dam wall (60-110 million cubic metres a day).\nHowever, Ethiopia sped up the process by closing three of the four diversion outlets that led to lower levels downstream which disrupted Sudan's pumping stations for irrigation and municipal water supply.\nThe point of contention appears to be the holder of the rights to the water resource with Egypt\u2019s stating the legal framework was in agreed in 1959 with Sudan for allocation of the Nile waters. This agreement allowed no water for Ethiopia or the other riparian states upstream, being Tanzania, Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Burundi, Kenya, Eritrea, and South Sudan.\nAn argument exists in that Egypt should forgo its perceived historic water rights as defined in the 1929 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty and the 1959 agreement between Egypt and Sudan that only favour those two countries and the Nile River re-designated a regional water course with a resource sharing agreement in a legal framework. The issue has risen due to perceived historic rights and the requirement to modernise and assist in evolving the economies of developing countries. A major stumbling block in resolving (or perhaps helping) the issues may be the involvement of the major powers in involving themselves to influence outcomes.\nThe US have held back non-humanitarian aid to Ethiopia due to this issue and the problems in the Tigray area.\nThe Chinese have financial/economic/political interests in Egypt and Ethiopia (Chinese Banks are financing the Dam) and would probably prefer to avoid conflict.\nThe Russians have just signed a military cooperation agreement with Ethiopia to transform the National Defence Force in knowledge, skill and technology spheres and have been a traditional supplier of military hardware to Ethiopia. \nGiven the progress of the Dam\u2019s construction, the capability of Egypt\u2019s armed forces and the logistics involved, major conflict is unlikely.\nThe Egyptian President under particular pressure from his public.\nOnly diplomacy and negotiation will resolve this. https://www.water-technology.net/projects/grand-ethiopian-renaissance-dam-africa/  https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-53432948  https://www.brookings.edu/blog/africa-in-focus/2020/08/05/the-controversy-over-the-grand-ethiopian-renaissance-dam/  https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/7/6/egypt-angry-ethiopia-resumes-filling-gerd  https://www.aljazeera.com/program/inside-story/2021/7/4/ethiopias-renaissance-dam-has-diplomacy-failed  https://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/2/10/408810/World/Africa/Sudan-rules-out-armed-action-over-Ethiopias-GERD.aspx  https://www.egypttoday.com/Article/1/105370/State-Department-US-supports-Egypt\u2019s-rights-seeks-to-reach-GERD  https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2021/07/china-ready-intervene-nile-dam-crisis  https://www.bloombergquint.com/onweb/diplomatic-pressure-mounts-on-ethiopia-over-filling-of-giant-dam  https://www.voanews.com/africa/second-filling-ethiopias-giant-dam-nearly-complete-state-media  https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-57467640  https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/how-do-egypt-ethiopia-stack-up-militarily-671092  https://www.thenationalnews.com/mena/2021/07/05/taking-gerd-dispute-to-security-council-may-be-egypt-and-sudans-last-diplomatic-attempt/  https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/why-ethiopias-mega-dam-has-its-neighbors-fuming/2021/07/07/dedf7692-df11-11eb-a27f-8b294930e95b_story.html  https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/world/africa/2021-07-06-egypt-and-sudan-sound-alarm-as-ethiopia-resumes-filling-nile-dam/  https://russiancouncil.ru/en/blogs/andrew-korybko/will-us-sanctions-against-ethiopia-provide-russia-with-regional-openin/  https://www.voanews.com/africa/us-continues-non-humanitarian-assistance-pause-pressure-ethiopia-end-tigray-conflict  https://www.aa.com.tr/en/africa/russia-ethiopia-ink-military-cooperation-agreement/2302337  https://www.africanews.com/2021/05/31/why-are-protestors-in-ethiopia-and-mali-waving-russian-flags//  https://apnews.com/article/global-trade-egypt-cairo-moscow-suez-canal-d090a2f5edee60aec9a97369c5235faf\nhttps://www.france24.com/en/africa/20210709-security-council-backs-african-union-mediation-bid-over-disputed-nile-dam\n"], [34815, "2021-07-24T04:15:10Z", [0.0], ""], [102006, "2021-07-23T22:06:27Z", [0.01], "Since 1978 there have been no Egyptian losses in military conflicts besides the Gulf War, the Sinai Insurgency and the Second Libyan Civil War (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_involving_Egypt#Arab_Republic_of_Egypt_(1971%E2%80%93present).
