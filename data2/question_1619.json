However, I can see significant potential for relaxing the enforcement (e.g. forbearance of fines) as a place where MEPs and industry might find some compromise. However, given that there is so much stimulus money flying around these days, I also think it is likely that MEPs might say to auto industry \"we're not relaxing the emissions standards, but here are X billion Euros for your pain\" as a way of avoiding the wrath of greens/liberals, while still handing something to industry.

Because there is already backlash by other/adjacent industries that benefit from these regulations [1,2] and the opposition by the car industry is not as unified as it may seem -  notably, Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW remain in favour of the CO2 regulations [3,4]. In addition, before the crisis, EV car sales had increased by 57% in Q1 2020 [5].  There are certainly talks ongoing at the moment - and in the coming weeks and months. Thus, while I don't expect standards to be relaxed, it's not completely improbable that there will be a delay of some sorts. A lot depends on the development of the European economy in the next months. The discussion will probably intensify as soon as or if it becomes clear that companies won't be able to comply with the regulations. Edit: Edited comment for clarity.
