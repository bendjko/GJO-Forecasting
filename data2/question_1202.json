The head of the key labor group, which represents more than 12 million active and retired members across a range of industries, added that the agreement \u201cwould be defeated\u201d if the House voted before Thanksgiving. Trumka\u2019s comments underscore the sustained resistance to the USMCA from labor groups even as the White House and key business organizations push for the deal\u2019s swift approval. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and top Democratic negotiators have said they want to resolve concerns about the deal harming American workers or the environment before they ratify it. The labor leader\u2019s remarks undermine a key claim from the president as he makes his case for the deal: that major labor unions back the USMCA. . . . Last month, White House trade advisor Peter Navarro said he saw a \u201c100%\u201d chance the House approved the USMCA by the end of the year. Companies reliant on trade with America\u2019s northern and southern neighbors have also pushed for approval of the deal.

She added that her caucus has not yet had its concerns about enforcing the agreement assuaged. They worry the USMCA will not go far enough to stop companies from moving to Mexico in order to hire workers for lower wages than in the U.S. \u201cWe want to be sure that as we go forward, we are strengthening America\u2019s working families and our farmers who are very affected by this,\u201d she said.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  It sounds to me like House Democrats have some issues that haven't yet been resolved and everyone is busy with impeachment and re-election issues, and that it won't be taken up until late November, at the earliest."], [1333, "2019-10-12T19:45:21Z", [0.01], ""], [691, "2019-10-12T12:26:40Z", [0.01], ""], [14107, "2019-10-12T10:52:07Z", [0.05], ""], [1333, "2019-10-11T17:51:14Z", [0.02], ""], [691, "2019-10-11T13:21:02Z", [0.01], ""], [79461, "2019-10-10T21:03:54Z", [0.02], ""], [62808, "2019-10-10T18:45:39Z", [0.01], ""], [61938, "2019-10-10T18:10:32Z", [0.03], ""], [691, "2019-10-10T14:03:19Z", [0.01], ""], [128, "2019-10-10T12:47:49Z", [0.03], ""], [25141, "2019-10-10T07:19:54Z", [0.0], ""], [1333, "2019-10-09T17:59:31Z", [0.03], ""], [15196, "2019-10-09T01:20:59Z", [0.0], ""], [30610, "2019-10-09T00:05:50Z", [0.0], ""], [6978, "2019-10-08T13:59:50Z", [0.0], "Fin."], [128, "2019-10-08T12:49:47Z", [0.05], ""], [63835, "2019-10-07T22:01:33Z", [0.01], "Loud noises made by Democratic spokespersons on the radio this morning about wanting to get this done-----  if \"protections for workers could be ironed out\".\nWhatever that means.\nI hadn't heard any outcry on post-NAFTA ratification through the summer.\nCould just be politics of the day - a reaction to GOP banter to get this done in October. \nNo upside to Dems for agreeing to this in October.\nNevertheless -  a 1% chance - given the issue now has a heartbeat."], [691, "2019-10-07T12:11:54Z", [0.01], ""], [21046, "2019-10-07T02:21:35Z", [0.02], ""], [63674, "2019-10-07T01:51:29Z", [0.02], ""], [75824, "2019-10-07T01:24:29Z", [0.05], "Chair of USMCA working group going down to Mexico next week to discuss labor enforcement budget.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi needs to bring President Donald Trump\u2019s U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement \u2014 the successor to the North American Free Trade Agreement \u2014 up for debate as soon as possible with a plan for passage. Expect an Uncivil War between Democrats representing farming districts and those bashing Big Pharma. Farmers are eager to recoup losses after Canada and Mexico retaliated against agricultural when Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. New market opportunities await in the USMCA.\n. . .  The biggest stumbling block in the Democratic-controlled House is Big Pharma. U.S. pharmaceutical companies would have 10 years of protection for biologic drugs in Canada and Mexico \u2014 rather than just eight in Canada \u2014 before generic competition ensues. Mexico had no limitation. However, it\u2019s 12 years under U.S. law. Biologics are made from living organisms and include such groundbreaking drugs as anti-inflammatory Humira, cancer-fighter Rituxan, and Enbrel, which treats rheumatoid arthritis. Biologics are expected to address ailments such as diabetes, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and cancer. They are the big new thing in pharmaceuticals \u2014 expensive to develop and costing the average patient (and/or insurance company) about $100,000 annually. According to the Food and Drug Administration, they account for two percent of all U.S. prescriptions, but 40 percent of total drug spending. While the current window of protection is actually longer under U.S. law, progressive Democrats worry the trade agreement would lock in the 10-year duration and preclude reform. One reason they sank the Obama administration\u2019s Trans-Pacific Partnership was because of its eight years of protection. They apparently want seven years maximum, allowing generic equivalents called \u201cbiosimilars\u201d to enter the market. Big Pharma argues that doesn\u2019t allow it adequate time to recoup its investment. That solution is unlikely to resolve the impasse. Big Labor also is caught betwixt and between. The AFL-CIO has \u201cserious concerns\u201d that the provision will raise drug prices. But the USMCA also could boost U.S. production of car and truck parts, without a tariff beginning in 2020 if 75 percent of components are made in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, compared to 62.5 percent now. Thirty percent of workers (40 percent in 2023) would have to make at least $16 per hour \u2014 triple the current wage for Mexican autoworkers \u2014 or tariffs would be imposed. The average U.S. autoworker earns $22 per hour. The administration hopes that will boost U.S. production and jobs, but it also could boost car prices. Other areas of concern exist, notably over labeling, where the Trump administration reverts to its anti-regulatory stance. An effort to kill nutrition labels on food \u2014 pushed by the junk food industry \u2014 was killed after a public outcry. A provision that \u201ctechnical regulations concerning labels \u2026 do not become unnecessary obstacles to trade\u201d opens up a can of worms \u2014 literally \u2014 that health considerations and consumer interests about ingredients could take a back seat to industry interests and expediency. Likewise, we\u2019d to see a Country of Original Label reinstated, a concern of farm and consumer groups.

Frankly, any form of serious reworking will drag out the timeline. If the bill is not submitted by Aug 1, the max 90 day timeline (https://www.rpc.senate.gov/policy-papers/usmca-where-things-stand) reduces the likelihood of it getting pushed through without serious concessions and (in my opinion means the probability for this question will fall). Adjusting up because:\n1. General consensus in Congress is good. House Democrats largely support it and their concerns seem overcomable\n2. Trump needs the deal after stalling talks with China and will push to get it done\n3. Democrats will benefit from showing they can work across the aisle on trade\n4.

The Trump Administration submitted a draft so-called Statement of Administrative Action on May 30 (which would allow the Trump administration to send the trade deal to Congress within 30 days), Before House has finished working with Lighthizer. \nThat move , in my opinion, shifted further into the future the date of ratification. On the other hand, Trump needs that deal for his presidential campaign(and so, probably, he is ready to make the administration to satisfy a fair share of demands of the House) and the time is running away. \"The 2020 presidential race squeezes the timing for a vote on the bill to implement the USMCA. Lawmakers of both parties have warned that passing such a deal will be politically tricky in an election year. That means the best chance for a vote would be before Congress recesses in August to avoid typical end-of-the-year budget fights, according to North Carolina Representative Mark Meadows, a close Trump ally.\"(Should we believe to the man, though?) But administration definitely shouldn't jam the deal - House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has history of taking trade agreements off the fast track, when the administration introduced agreement without her assent  (as she did with the U.S.-Colombia FTA in 2007 ,when she asserted that the administration deviated from its statutory obligations under the Trade Promotion Authority legislation). I am looking for committee hearing on  June 19 to clarify the situation.\n"], [61938, "2019-06-14T19:58:41Z", [0.15], ""], [1333, "2019-06-14T18:39:19Z", [0.07], ""], [41373, "2019-06-14T08:18:21Z", [0.33], ""], [1333, "2019-06-13T19:11:00Z", [0.08], ""], [57110, "2019-06-13T16:43:09Z", [0.3], ""], [53391, "2019-06-13T13:38:03Z", [0.05], "Democrats will not approve it.

Qualitative factors weighing in favour of No: - Congress is more divided along partisan lines.

Today the deal was signed by a Republican president that the democrat-majority house is very unlikely to support\u2014they want to ensure the president has no wins leading up to the next election.

(i.e. we're now at 25%) - Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the US House of Representatives, said that\n    - the House would not consider any USMCA ratification discussions unless Mexico approved such legislation.

These issues are not independent of the first, so they have already been accounted for in that prediction (i.e. these issues won't make me lower my prediction further). Qualitative factors weighing in favour of Yes: - Procedural barriers have been passed (both from the Politico article noted above):\n    - U.S. International Trade Commission last month released a mandatory analysis of the agreement's economic impacts. The report was largely neutral and didn't seem to garner much criticism from either side.\n    - Mexico passed a landmark labor reform law required by the new pact\n    Though they remove procedural barriers to ratification these, factors do not greatly affect the negative factors listed above.
