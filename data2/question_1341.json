I tried to think about using historical data, but from looking at the National Book Awards website, the judges seem to change every year, which makes it a little harder to believe that past information is predictive of future outcomes. [1] In addition, some have written about how the awards are not a reward for success, which makes it hard to believe that using sales data or book review information is predictive of award outcomes. [2] I looked at a list of winners, and though I think I'm pretty well read, but I don't really recognize many of the more recent winners (post 2000). [3] This is suggestive that this is really not a popularity contest.  Of course, I haven't really investigated data on these issues, (whether sales, for example, is predictive of outcomes), but I doubt I would find anything, and if I did I don't how believable it would be. Given that the crowd doesn't seem to have any strong leaning (or any explanations), I'm just gonna predict even across the slate. I'm hopeful someone will think of a good tactic to predict this question.
