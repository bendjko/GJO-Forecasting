Source for current value: https://markets.ft.com/data/bonds/government-bonds-spreads Result: 26, 19, 16, 13, 26 An additional historical analogy: over the summer of 2011 the spread jumped from 200 basis points to more than 400 in the span of 5 months, driven by the EU debt crisis. Throughout 2011 and 2012, the spread repeatedly jumped hundreds of basis points over the course of a few months. This suggests that if concerns over Italian debt reached similar proportions the >3 bins would easily come into play.  Inside View: The current Italian populist government is seeking a fiscally expansionary policy that will require an increase in the budget deficit. This naturally makes investors worried Italy wouldn't be able to repay its debt, and has been putting an upward pressure on the yield. [1] The Italian government is also dealing with slow (or nonexistent) economic growth which makes it even less capable of repaying its debt. [1] As higher yields make borrowing more expensive they beget a feedback loop that only makes matters worse. From this perspective, Italy is on a trajectory of rising yields. I am thus raising the distribution from the Outside View. To watch: * How will the government respond to the rising spread? One would expect that they'd have learned a lesson from the 2011-2012 debt crisis and may adopt reform measures that appease investors.
