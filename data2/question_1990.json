However, Poland has yet to advise EU according to the EU table, https://bit.ly/3vkQVoR, as of today (with last entry being Finland's notification of 4 days ago). In principle, that leaves Austria, Netherlands, Hungary and Romania to notify. My understanding is that Romania has approved the legislation but is yet to notify the EU. So, Austria, Netherlands and Hungary appear to be the laggards. Netherlands does not have a formal government at the moment. Will the 'caretaker' government have the ability or courage to approve such legislation? Or will Hungary continue to hold out in opposition to the rule of law element in the ORD? As Oban and Kurz are apparently on good terms, (https://bit.ly/3uoYw4y), will they both attempt to use their legislation / notification to leverage their respective objectives? Kurz obviously has his own battle to fight at home regarding the investigation into corruption in his government (https://politi.co/3yFCmyc) which may in turn lead to his demise from office. I've read a few comments suggesting Austria could be heading for elections in the coming weeks or months (https://twitter.com/markus_pausch/status/1396518490526396416?s=20). Will Austria approve and notify before then? As the number of countries to notify dwindles, so, potentially, the 100% for this question should become clearer.

Thus, it appears that these countries want to take art in the program and are likely to approve legislation and notify the EU quite soon. Netherlands, on the other hand, has done neither and does not have a fully functional government. The clock is ticking and the laggards will start feeling pressure soon, I expect, from the likes of Michel, Von der Leyen and Macron.

Countries are already incorporating the funds into their budgets for the next year (https://www.economist.com/briefing/2021/03/31/europes-radical-economic-response-to-covid-19), so they don\u2019t expect it to fail. The European Commission expects the ratifications to be done by late June, presumably to allow for the inevitable domestic political negotiations to take place, so if there are still problems by that point then I\u2019d start to be worried. The sensible time to negotiation concessions was months ago (and concessions were definitely made), and those were made under threat of a hold-up.  Holdouts as of 5/8:  \u2022\tEstonia \u2013 Estonia was originally threatening to hold up ratification over funding for the Rail Baltica plan alongside Latvia and Lithuania, though this was resolved in mid-March (https://news.err.ee/1608140158/rail-baltica-eu-funding-dispute-reaches-resolution). Latvia and Lithuania have already ratified as well. The ruling coalition is moving to vote in favor of ratifying over objections from an opposition party (https://news.err.ee/1608202966/government-to-link-eu-recovery-fund-bill-to-confidence-vote). Goal is to adopt the fund bill by June 24, and they appear poised to do that. Sidenote, the Estonian parliament has the most gorgeous conference table I\u2019ve ever seen in the second link, I\u2019m very jealous.   \u2022\tIreland \u2013 Government is working on its recovery plan to submit to the EU (https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/coalition-eyes-900m-from-eu-recovery-and-resilience-covid-fund-1.4554501), the main hold-up currently seems to be discussion around withholding funds if changes to Ireland\u2019s tax regime aren\u2019t updated as part of meeting Ireland\u2019s country-specific recommendations for receiving funds. There is flexibility in determining if those recommendations are met, and the bloc has compromised on larger issues in the past like rule-of-law provisions with Poland and Hungary. Ratification is not done by a parliamentary vote (https://www.funcas.es/articulos/ratification-of-the-eu-own-resources-decision-what-is-the-state-of-affairs/) so its not clear what the hold-up has been. Ireland has strong ties to the EU though, of all countries Ireland would be a strange one to hold up a bill like this.  \u2022\tHungary - *some uncertainty* Previously held up the package because of rule of law provisions alongside Poland, now sorting out its funding proposals after deciding not to take loans and removing its controversial universities from the funding package. Fidesz holds 2/3 control of parliament so if they want to approve the measure that their leader negotiated they most likely can. Their partner in prior hold-ups (Poland) has already passed a bill to ratify too. That said, they don\u2019t have a vote scheduled yet, and may be waiting for the EU to approve their recovery plan. Doing so may give them more leverage to get more controversial provisions approved. Stalling for negotiations on the other hand seems likely, but holding up dispersals for two months would be pretty drastic. Hardest hit countries have made it clear time is of the essence with the package, so a stall that long is not likely. Outright rejecting is also highly unlikely; they\u2019re a net beneficiary of the bill, negotiated it into an acceptable place last year, and the ruling party has a strong majority in parliament. They\u2019ll likely stall approval, but the question timeframe is very generous. \u2022\tNetherlands \u2013 **most uncertainty** The Dutch are still in negotiations for forming a new coalition since a critical partner from the prior one decided not to back the PM. The Dutch weren\u2019t a fan of the recovery fund but did accept it once they got an option added to stop dispersals if a country objects so they can act as a watchdog. A new government may not include Rutte as PM though. He has a reputation for resiliency in Dutch politics, but unfortunately there aren\u2019t many scandals in Dutch politics that are at all comparable to the child benefit scandal to judge what it\u2019ll actually mean in the future. Rutte\u2019s party is still the largest party so they\u2019ll definitely be involved, and if that\u2019s the case it\u2019ll be difficult to reject the recovery bill. Further, a new coalition or PM doesn\u2019t change the underlying parliament seats, and Rutte\u2019s party as the largest party may serve to ensure that everything goes smoothly. The Dutch skew Eurosceptic but they\u2019re a beneficiary of the common market, and negotiated clauses alongside their frugal neighbors that their government found acceptable. However, that government is currently in flux, and its unclear where it will land or how long that will take. For that reason, this is probably the most uncertain vote. \u2022\tAustria \u2013 Recovery plan already submitted, and they were a major party to the negotiations over the text of the law as a member of the \u201cfrugal four\u201d, and two of the other members have already agreed. Per the Austrian finance minister, a member of the ruling coalition, the bill will be passed in Austria as well as other countries, so the Austrians don\u2019t appear to want to go back on their negotiated deal, and there aren\u2019t elections for another year or so that could shake things up (https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/16/austria-blumel-is-convinced-eu-recovery-funds-will-go-ahead.html).  \u2022\tPoland \u2013 Draft law already approved and a recovery plan already put forward; they just need to formally submit their approval to the EU. The vote already took place and the politics is mostly over, its just a matter of the formal approval taking place.  \u2022\tRomania \u2013 Difficult to find news on them, seems like the issue is the vote being held up by the opposition party over the contents of the RRF plan. (https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/short_news/romanias-psd-blocks-approval-of-eus-own-resources-decision/) Romania brought a draft of its plan to negotiate with the EC and it was rejected so its plan is still in the works, expected to be finished by the end of May instead of the April 31 deadline. Of all the objections to the recovery plan this feels more easily addressable, there\u2019s no ideological disagreement over bloc-wide taxes or anything, this strikes me as political posturing since it\u2019ll take awhile for the plan to be worked out. It is possible that this will lead to delays, Romania does require a 2/3 vote in parliament to ratify the plan, but it doesn\u2019t sound like there\u2019s any direct will to not ratify.  \u2022\tFinland \u2013 So the Finnish court ruled that the parliament needs a 2/3 majority to pass the ratification bill, which means the ruling coalition can\u2019t pass it by itself. However, as of May 7 the National Coalition party rescinded its plan to abstain from voting on the measure, and the Centre Party, who is the coalition partner more skeptical of the package, announced that they would vote in favor (though two PMs from both Centre and NCP announced they\u2019d actually vote against).
