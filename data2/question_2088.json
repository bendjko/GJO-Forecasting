An important detail (and point of possible confusion) is that the 76th Session of the UN General Assembly, which the question is explicitly about, goes on until September 2022, and it does *not* end with the end of the general debate next week. If I had any doubts previously as to Kyaw Moe Tun being considered as an NUG representative, they went away after checking the weekly formal letters he has been sending to the UN Secretary-General [4], where it is explicit that he recognizes and represents NUG as the legitimate government of Myanmar (well, even the people portrayed in the front page of [4] are NUG officials, and the Links section consists exclusively of links to NUG and its ministries).

The arrangement, which was described by multiple diplomatic sources and representatives of advocacy groups familiar with internal deliberations, has been informally endorsed by representatives of the European Union, members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and Russia.  The United States and its European allies were concerned that a country sympathetic to the military regime\u2019s claims might appeal to the credential committees to take up the matter before its first scheduled meeting in November. They are hoping to delay any decision on Myanmar\u2019s representation as long as possible, preserving a diplomatic stalemate that ensures Myanmar\u2019s current ambassador, Kyaw Moe Tun, will maintain his right to Myanmar\u2019s U.N. seat. \u201cWe\u2019re interested in keeping the status quo as long as we can,\u201d said one diplomat from a country involved in the discussions.  In a brief telephone interview, Kyaw Moe Tun confirmed that international negotiations are underway to determine how to move forward on Myanmar\u2019s U.N. seat. He said he would \u201cmost likely not\u201d deliver an address to the U.N. General Assembly, even though the list of speakers for the assembly includes Myanmar The deal involved an arrangement in which U.N. member states would agree to put off any discussion in the U.N. Credentials Committee of the military junta\u2019s diplomatic status until after the U.N.\u2019s annual diplomatic jamboree. In the meantime, Kyaw Moe Tun [...] has agreed not to address the assembly during the session or sit in Myanmar\u2019s seat in the General Assembly. In the telephone interview, Kyaw Moe Tun did not confirm whether Myanmar\u2019s seat will remain empty during the high-level debate.  Discussion on the fate of Myanmar\u2019s diplomatic representation will be put off until at least November, when the U.N. Credentials Committee will convene to consider a request by Myanmar\u2019s military regime to install its chosen envoy to represent Myanmar at the world body.  \u201cWhat we are hearing, and this seems to be increasingly solid, is that the credential committee will defer. They will say they can\u2019t draw a firm conclusion now, and that will encourage [Kyaw Moe Tun] to stay on,\u201d said Richard Gowan, the U.N. representative at the International Crisis Group. But Kyaw Moe Tun will not represent the country\u2019s National Unity Government \u201cApparently, there has been a quiet gentleman\u2019s agreement that the current ambassador will keep a low profile during [this] high-level week and won\u2019t use it as an opportunity to attack the regime,\u201d Gowan added. Some in Washington see the effort to keep the junta away from the U.N. gathering as a key step to denying it further international legitimacy. \u201cIt would be useful to ensure that the Tatmadaw [military] does not have representatives at the U.N., as you know, because I think that gives them automatic credibility,\u201d said one congressional committee aide, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cIt\u2019s something we don\u2019t want to see.\u201d\n----------------- Now, I am not sure how we should read this \"Kyaw Moe Tun will not represent the country\u2019s National Unity Government\". I can take it to mean simply that Kyaw Moe Tun will not *speak* as NUG representative during the UNGA General Debate (i.e. keeping a low profile, in accordance with other excerpts above and the apparent spirit of the alleged deal); an alternative reading could be that he will explicitly agree not to be considered as representing NUG, but this does not seem to be supported by the rest of the article. And if he does not represent NUG, who exactly will he be representing? Thoughts?

Quoting: ---------------------------\n\"50. There are broadly four options that the UN Credentials Committee must decide upon. 51. First, the Credentials Committee could recommend acceptance of the credentials of the\nmilitary junta. [...] Based on these considerations the Credentials Committee should not recommend to \nthe UN General Assembly that the credentials issued by the Myanmar military junta be accepted. 52. Second, the Credentials Committee could recommend acceptance of the credentials of the\nNUG. [...] Based on these considerations the Credentials Committee should recommend to the\nUN General Assembly that the credentials of the representatives of the NUG be\naccepted. The Credentials Committee has made similar decisions in relation to Liberia\n(1990-97), Sierra Leone (1996), Haiti (1991-94), and Honduras (2009). 53. Third, the Credentials Committee could defer a decision on the credentials. [...]\non the understanding that Myanmar\u2019s current Permanent\nRepresentative to the UN in New York, Kyaw Moe Tun, continue to represent Myanmar\nprovisionally at the General Assembly. [...] The Credentials Committee should\nonly defer the decision if it can provide well founded reasons why it has not been able\nto accept the credentials of the NUG. The Credentials Committee has made similar\ndecisions in relation to Afghanistan (1997-2001), Guinea (2009-10) and Madagascar\n(2009) and Guinea-Bissau (2012). 54. Fourth, the Credentials Committee could decide to leave the seat of Myanmar vacant at the\nUN General Assembly. It could do this either by deferring its decision on credentials,\nexplicitly on the understanding that no one will represent Myanmar at the Assembly\u2019s 76th\nsession (as in the case of Cambodia in 1997), or by deciding not to accept any credentials\nsubmitted for Myanmar (as in the case of South Africa during the apartheid regime, albeit\nin that case without any competing credentials). [...] The Credentials Committee should not\nrecommend that the seat of Myanmar be left vacant at the UN General Assembly.\"\n------------------------------ As already noticed before [2, 3], under a \"regular\" process, the Credentials Committee is not expected to issue a report before the question closes on Oct 2; nevertheless, the scenarios described above will be applicable in the case that some State raises the issue of Myanmar representation as a \"point of order\", and the Credentials Committee will indeed be required to report before Oct 2. And here is NYT, reporting today (Sep 11) about the representation of Myanmar and Afghanistan in the forthcoming UNGA [4]: \"\u201cI think the Credentials Committee will indulge in what we might call creative procrastination,\u201d said Richard Gowan, the U.N. director at the International Crisis Group. Such a delay, he said, would allow both ambassadors \u201cto stay in the post for the time being, albeit on fragile ground.\u201d\" \nAs stated previously, I *assume* that a deferral allowing (pro-NUG) Kyaw Moe Tun to continue to represent Myanmar provisionally at the GA would resolve the question in the positive, but I am not certain about that, hence my forecast is not higher towards a \"yes\". ----------------\n[1] https://the-world-is-watching.org/2021/09/08/legal-opinon-the-representation-of-the-state-of-the-union-of-myanmar-at-the-united-nations/\n[2] https://specialadvisorycouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/SAC-M-Briefing-Paper-Myanmars-Representation-in-the-UN-ENGLISH.pdf\n[3] https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1330317\n[4] https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/11/world/un-ambassadors-myanmar-afghanistan.html"], [59881, "2021-09-10T18:09:06Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2021-09-09T03:23:06Z", [0.0], ""], [100896, "2021-09-09T03:03:07Z", [0.1], ""], [79142, "2021-09-08T21:48:30Z", [0.05], ""], [101031, "2021-09-07T21:57:56Z", [0.42], ""], [81456, "2021-09-07T21:18:36Z", [0.71], "Increasing again, after the analysis in https://specialadvisorycouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/SAC-M-Briefing-Paper-Myanmars-Representation-in-the-UN-ENGLISH.pdf (h/t @GMR ).

Across Myanmar, the battle continues between the military and those opposed to the military coup d\u2019etat of 1 February 2021. Opposition to the coup began with non-violent resistance in the form of the Civil Disobedience Movement. The aim is now revolution and an end to the military\u2019s decades-long dominance of political life. The revolutionaries have brought within their fold some of the armed ethnic organisations that have long fought against the military in the country\u2019s borderlands. Civil war is looming. A different battle for Myanmar is being fought in the United Nations. On 14 September, the 75th UN General Assembly (UNGA) will meet in New York. Presidents, prime ministers and dictators from across the world \u2013 or their representatives \u2013 will gather to discuss, debate and make recommendations on global issues. The question de jour is who will represent Myanmar \u2013 the military\u2019s representative or the representative of the democratically elected, ousted government? It is the job of a nine-country Credentials Committee to make a recommendation to the UNGA about whose credentials to accept. It is rare for the Committee to accept the credentials of an ousted government that does not hold power or control territory, but it is not unprecedented (Haiti in 1992, Sierra Leone in 1997).

What's more, any decision by the UN General Assembly (GA) to reject the credentials of the military government in favor of NUG will not pose any kind of restrictions whatsoever regarding bilateral diplomatic relations of UN member states with Myanmar; this is clearly stated in the GA Resolution 396(V), \"Recognition by the United Nations of the representation of a Member State\" [1]: \"[The GA] Declares that the attitude adopted by the General Assembly or its Interim Committe concerning any such question shall not of itself affect the direct relations of individual Member States with the State concerned;\" Bottom line here: \"Dear Myanmar military, we can reject you from representing Myanmar in the GA, and still be friends (i.e. maintain normal diplomatic relations)\". Arguably, this leaves much flexibility on the table for states that will choose to do so; such states can still send a (strong) message without formally breaking relationships with the military regime. --- 2 - History Similar rejections of (military) governments from the GA in favor of democratically elected and/or exiled ones have happened many times in the past: \"In the cases of Cambodia, Sierra Leone, Afghanistan, Liberia and Haiti, \nthe Credentials Committee either deferred a decision on the credentials\nof the government or accredited a former representative instead of the\ngovernment effectively in control of the territory\" [2] Useful to remind here that the decisions of both the Credentials Committee and the GA itself are taken by simple majority, and there is no kind of veto involved (so Russia and China cannot block such a decision on their own). --- 3 - Situation on the ground There have been multiple attempts by Myanmar since February to remove and replace their current UN Permanent Representative, Kyaw Moe Tun, but all of them have been steadily rejected so far by the UN system [3][4][5]. At the time of writing, Kyaw Moe Tun is still listed as UN ambassador of Myanmar in the UN Protocol and Liaison Service [6].

Thomas-Greenfield wrote an opinion piece in the Washington Post [7] back on March 2021, praising current Myanmar ambassador Kyaw Moe Tun, listing what measures the US have already taken against the military regime in Myanmar, and culminating with a statement: \"We will do more. And we need our allies and regional partners to do more, too.\" [7] Which, to me, sounds like a call to arms for US partners and allies. Thomas-Greenfield has steadily since backed her OP with public tweets [8][9], assuring that the US will escalate and sustain pressure toward the Myanmar military regime. Far from being any kind of \"rogue\" diplomat with a possible personal agenda, Thomas-Greenfield was just recently chosen to lead the US Presidential Delegation to the closing ceremony of the Tokyo Olympics [10]; most likely, her words and actions have the explicit approval of her superiors in the US State Department (if not of the White House). And to make the situation even worse for the Myanmar military regime, an alleged plot to assassinate current Myanmar ambassador to the UN Kyaw Moe Tun was just recently uncovered by the FBI [11][12][13]. Attempting such an assassination on US soil sounds like adding insult to injury; as we could easily guess, Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield was not at all happy, and she made that explicit [14][15]. --- 5 - Other considerations A recent (July 2021) UK parliamentary report, titled \"The UK Government\u2019s Response to the Myanmar Crisis\" [16], seems to be all in favor of recognizing NUG as the legitimate government of Myanmar; quoting from Section 2 [17]: --\n8 [in bold]. If the UK is to fulfil its unique potential to mediate, it has to demonstrate a willingness to take action beyond statements. A coherent and concerted response is needed by the United Nations if the junta is to feel any real pressure. Actions should be taken to de-legitimise the junta\u2019s authority, block its supply of arms, and encourage regional actors to take firmer measures. The National Unity Government (NUG) 9. The National Unity Government of Myanmar consists of parliamentarians elected in the 2020 election, members of various ethnic groups, and figures in the anti-coup movement.12 Given the evidence we have heard, and the NUG\u2019s active role in promoting democracy in Myanmar, we believe that they, not the junta, represent the legitimate and expressed will of the Myanmar people.13 However, the UK Government\u2019s policy of recognising states, rather than governments, is an obstacle to the recognition of these legitimate representatives. 10 [in bold]. The UK Government cannot be said to support democracy in Myanmar if it does not recognise the outcome of democratic elections in Myanmar. The National Unity Government comprises the legitimate representatives of the people of Myanmar, whose election has been found valid by third party observers. Rather than an exile government, the NUG should be treated as a government-in-waiting.\n-- Even if \"the UK Government\u2019s policy of recognising states, rather than governments, is an obstacle to the recognition of these legitimate representatives\", as stated in para 8 above, this does not prohibit actions related to the UN GA representation (which the question here is about), in the spirit of what I have already pointed out in section 1 above. --- CONCLUSION & ASSESSMENT Given the situation as described above, I think the crowd's assessment here (currently at 0%) grossly underestimates the actual odds. ---------------\n[1] https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/209556?ln=en\n[2] Alison Duxbury, The Participation of States in International Organisations, 2011, p. 118, http://ndl.ethernet.edu.et/bitstream/123456789/7658/1/21.pdf\n[3] https://archive.is/xeMIg\n[4] https://apnews.com/article/europe-myanmar-united-nations-united-nations-general-assembly-3a463feb101e1fb975888349483e91bc\n[5] https://thediplomat.com/2021/07/myanmars-junta-tries-and-fails-to-appoint-a-new-un-ambassador/\n[6] https://bluebook.unmeetings.org/ - choose \"Member States maintaining permanent missions in Headquarters\" in the 1st pull-down menu and \"Myanmar\" in the 2nd\n[7] https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/03/31/united-states-stands-with-people-burma-our-allies-must-too/\n[8] https://twitter.com/USAmbUN/status/1377388955860140034\n[9] https://twitter.com/usambun/status/1378340005345685505\n[10 https://twitter.com/USAmbUN/status/1424542745830514688\n[11] https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/06/nyregion/myanmar-ambassador-plot.html\n[12] https://www.smh.com.au/world/asia/fbi-exposes-plot-to-maim-or-assassinate-myanmar-s-un-ambassador-20210807-p58gpt.html\n[13] https://www.dw.com/en/two-myanmar-nationals-arrested-by-us-authorities-over-assassination-plot/a-58788182\n[14] https://usun.usmission.gov/statement-by-ambassador-linda-thomas-greenfield-on-arrests-in-the-alleged-plot-targeting-burmas-permanent-representative-to-the-united-nations-kyaw/\n[15] https://twitter.com/USAmbUN/status/1424051526172090370\n[16] https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5802/cmselect/cmfaff/203/20302.htm\n[17] https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5802/cmselect/cmfaff/203/20305.htm"], [79142, "2021-08-07T19:01:28Z", [0.0], ""], [90237, "2021-08-07T04:29:29Z", [0.0], ""], [38210, "2021-08-06T09:49:39Z", [0.0], "I think this from the UK government procludes the NUG being recognised.
