It seems that for a few weeks, shipments can be fulfilled by reserves [3,4] - not sure whether this will count as \"production\" for the OPEC report, though.  For my forecast, I am using a simple model with the following assumptions:\n1) at the end of the repair process, production will have returned to the May-August 2019 average production (9762 tb/d)\n2) from today until 2 weeks before full production is restored, the production will be at 6848 tb/d (this is based on the quote in [1] which states that more than half of lost production is already recovered - I am keeping it conservative at 50% recovery because I believe that publicly the progress will be overstated)\n3) in the week before full production is restored, production will be half way between 2) and 1), that's 8305 tb/d, to account for some ramp up time. I then look at different scenarios based on the sources [1] and [2] that contain estimates on how long repairs will take, and assign the scenarios a probability. \"2-3 weeks\" is a current estimate being mentioned, I include 4 and 6 weeks for repairs to be completed due to a project management heuristic that most projects take between the estimated time and twice the estimated time. Scenario, average production, probability\nTaking 2 weeks from 2019-09-17 to complete repairs, 9470 tb/d, 15%\nTaking 3 weeks from 2019-09-17 to complete repairs, 8888 tb/d, 30%\nTaking 4 weeks from 2019-09-17 to complete repairs, 8305 tb/d, 30%\nTaking 6 weeks from 2019-09-17 to complete repairs, 7139 tb/d, 15%\nTaking more than 6 weeks to complete repairs, 6848 tb/d, 10% Adding up the scenario probabilities for the corresponding buckets gets me to  10,15,60,15,0 Hedging a into the higher buckets because I think that if repairs go well, SA will run production above demand in order to replenish reserves.
