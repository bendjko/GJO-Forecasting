In the legislative election, there are other considerations at work than in the presidential election [4]. Latest developments and information require me to adjust the foreast: first, there are the latest - and final - polls [1], second, the support of PFP candidates by Foxconn founder Terry Gou [2], third, the relevance of the party lists in this election [3] and, fourth, the large margin of undecided voters [7]. Most of the pundits assume that the KMT won't repeat its result from 2016 (35 seats). My forecasts are strongly influenced by their opinion which may be dangerous. I still haven't found a proper foundation to compare the polls for the last and the current election. While it is a comparison of apples and pears using [1] and [6], the current state of the polls indicate that the KMT will indeed gain some seats. However, the composition of the party lists seems to have been a crucial factor for the decline in KMT support in the last months - and I hadn't taken them into consideration so far. In addition, Gou's support for the PFP may worsen the KMT's prospect due to the fact that both parties attract a similar voter base. Personal scandals of the KMT presidential candidate may reduce the trust of voters even further [5]. On the other hand, Han asked his followers to stop answering correctly to pollsters [8]. Thus, the large amount of undecided voters may also be a consequence of voters declining to respond honestly. In consequence, I've reduced the probability of the KMT receiving less than 36 seats and receiving between 50 and 56 seats in favor of the options in-between. I'm less and less convinced that the KMT can gain more than 50 seats and I'm confident that they won't get less than 36 seats. At the moment, I'm divided on the 36 < x < 42 and the 43 < x < 49 brackets. I'll make up my mind adjusting those two brackets in the coming days.

Most likely result is election will push % into the low 30s, which will edge up the number of seats a bit higher than last round. But, they probably need to get +35% to get more than 42, which seems pretty unlikely. --------------DPP-----KMT---------\n=======================\nDate | xx.x%, Del.  | xx.x%, Del.\n2020 | [31.9%] ??%, ??  | [22%] ??%, ??   \n2016 | [31.2%] 44%, 68 | [18.5%] 27%, 35 \n2012 | 44.5%, 64 | 34.6%, 40\n2008 | 36.9%, 27 | 51.2%, 81\n2004 | 38.0%, 89 | 35.0%, 79 \n2001 | 36.6%, 87 | 31.3%, 63 Actual results are without brackets and [polls] are bracketed.\nSource: Wikipedia"], [35766, "2019-12-18T22:15:04Z", [0.45, 0.35, 0.1, 0.06, 0.04], ""], [691, "2019-12-18T14:04:39Z", [0.51, 0.47, 0.02, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [63963, "2019-12-18T04:12:30Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.6, 0.25, 0.0], ""], [691, "2019-12-16T14:26:04Z", [0.54, 0.44, 0.02, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [18679, "2019-12-16T07:58:06Z", [0.75, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2019-12-15T17:06:54Z", [0.55, 0.35, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [38616, "2019-12-14T09:10:26Z", [0.2, 0.3, 0.25, 0.2, 0.05], ""], [70711, "2019-12-14T06:49:54Z", [0.1, 0.6, 0.3, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [27661, "2019-12-13T10:39:09Z", [0.02, 0.43, 0.31, 0.24, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2019-12-12T19:11:28Z", [0.6, 0.3, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2019-12-12T12:55:16Z", [0.56, 0.42, 0.02, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [72737, "2019-12-11T21:45:18Z", [0.5, 0.3, 0.14, 0.05, 0.01], ""], [14107, "2019-12-10T21:06:08Z", [0.32, 0.52, 0.12, 0.04, 0.0], ""], [41922, "2019-12-09T14:52:39Z", [0.1, 0.43, 0.3, 0.12, 0.05], ""], [29980, "2019-12-08T02:51:05Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.8], ""], [31251, "2019-12-07T15:37:30Z", [0.31, 0.33, 0.32, 0.02, 0.02], ""], [691, "2019-12-07T13:43:43Z", [0.56, 0.43, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [80843, "2019-12-06T21:53:11Z", [0.55, 0.1, 0.2, 0.05, 0.1], ""], [75863, "2019-12-06T19:49:23Z", [0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.4, 0.2], ""], [1333, "2019-12-05T19:26:34Z", [0.55, 0.3, 0.15, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [80810, "2019-12-05T08:34:38Z", [0.95, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [63963, "2019-12-05T02:10:47Z", [0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.3, 0.1], ""], [691, "2019-12-04T15:33:14Z", [0.56, 0.43, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [30194, "2019-12-04T01:06:11Z", [0.15, 0.2, 0.27, 0.33, 0.05], ""], [38739, "2019-12-04T00:04:26Z", [0.15, 0.85, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [48709, "2019-12-03T14:25:44Z", [0.6, 0.2, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0], "Initial prediction."], [1333, "2019-12-02T20:15:16Z", [0.45, 0.35, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [66692, "2019-12-02T12:09:55Z", [0.8, 0.15, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0], "They are currently polling at ~ 24 to 33% (depending on the poll), which translates to about 27 to 37 seats (if popular vote were to equal number of seats, which is NEVER the case...).

Although the KMT\u2019s presidential candidate is currently far behind in the polls (see my posts in the GJP question about the presidential election [1,2]), the KMT is still in a pretty strong position to win a majority of more than 56 seats in the Legislative Yuan. At the very least, the KMT is all but certain to increase its seat number from where it currently stands at 35. The current make-up of the Yuan was the result of a drubbing for the KMT in 2016 - support for the KMT was \"at an all-time low after the anti-KMT 2014 Sunflower Movement. Even KMT supporters were jaded with the party when it swapped presidential candidates months before the election, from the wildly unpopular Hung Hsiu-chu to the slightly less unpopular Eric Chu\" [3]. I think it's very unlikely that, despite recent scandals, the KMT will lose more seats than it currently has. I am taking the average of recent polling since news broke out five days ago that a Chinese spy in Australia has defected and revealed Beijing's extensive meddling in the Taiwanese 2020 general election, primarily on behalf of the KMT [4]. This seems like it is having a large impact on the 2020 election races [5], which is why I am only considering the most recent polling. Unfortunately, there have only been two recent polls - the average of the two shows a lead of ~2.6% for the DPP [6] (note that most polling prior to this shows a lead for the KMT). But it also shows that ~29.9% of voters are undecided, which means that there is still a lot of room for movement.  I will update as new polling comes out.

However, there are some factors that blur this positive prospect for the KMT [1, 2]: 1) Alleged election meddling by China in support of the KMT\n2) The ongoing conflict in Hong Kong\n3) The participation of the TPP as new third-party force besides the NPP (while it is not unlikely that these two parties in the end compete for the same seats with each other according to [2], voters that reject the firm attitude  of the DPP and the NPP(?) against China but are unsatisfied with the KMT may see an option here) Current polls show a lead for the DPP (33%) over the KMT (24%), the TPP (10,4%) and the NPP (8,7%) [3]. I wasn't able to find a source to compare these opinion polls with those conducted four years ago for the 2016 election but the race seems to be closer than the opinion polls on the presidential election indicate.
