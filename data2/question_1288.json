They seem to be prepared to lower rates again this year.[2] In my opinion, forward guidance puts pressure on the Fed to go through with what they said, as anything else is feared to shake up markets. In addition, President Trump keeps pushing his message for more significant rate cuts - one can re-iterate the independence of the Fed again and again, I still believe this has an influence on the decision process. --- \nCrowd: 52, 37, 11\n--- [1] https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=yieldAll\n[2] https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/09/17/interest-rates-fed-expected-cut-key-rate-wednesday/2347263001/"], [67609, "2019-09-18T07:34:34Z", [0.38, 0.27, 0.35], "New daily update from the data of 17/09/2019"], [29358, "2019-09-18T02:35:47Z", [0.95, 0.04, 0.01], ""], [79504, "2019-09-18T00:09:32Z", [0.55, 0.36, 0.09], "Because you won't let me pass on this question that I know absolutely nothing about."], [4492, "2019-09-17T19:42:37Z", [0.56, 0.36, 0.08], ""], [172, "2019-09-17T19:15:06Z", [0.05, 0.35, 0.6], ""], [63674, "2019-09-17T15:43:05Z", [0.5, 0.35, 0.15], ""], [79279, "2019-09-17T15:13:18Z", [0.0, 0.3, 0.7], "It's going to be bad.
