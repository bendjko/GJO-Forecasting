Anyone have sources?"], [85144, "2021-05-10T17:24:42Z", [0.99], "My initial rational was that the fighting was likely to go beyond this six month mark and the situation would not resolve within this period and so some sort of state of emergency (SOE) would stay in place. Looking at things now, I think this question has been poorly thought through by GJO, since it is one where the end result will be some dull technicality.  For example: 1) The question asks: \"will Ethiopia's Tigray region be under a federally-imposed state of emergency?\" Not whether the one implied in the question description will be renewed. There has been more than one SOE within the region, and one is due to covid  [0]. This may be semantics, but the question is vague on this basis.  2) The question looks like it will resolve through understanding the constitutional and legal situation and points of Ethiopian technical legal detail rather than one's ability to forecast.  Article 93 of the Ethiopian Constitution cannot be taken on it own as a basis for whether the question can be resolved as it currently stands. The question is whether the non-notification of an extension means the SOE has lapsed, or whether it is still in-tact but in a legally questionable situation regarding the constitution. The counterfactual here is whether the SOE has been lifted due to Article 93 of the Constitution mandating it is after 6 months, it's not clear that has happened in Tigray either, from my research. This is a legal question, and it is doubtful whether GJO is going to launch a legal review in Ethiopia to have this tested.  Further to this,  Human Rights Watch noted that a 2016 Ethiopian SOE went \"...far beyond what is permissible under international law\" [1], so it's difficult to look at this on any remotely comparative basis. It looks as if in 2018 an SOE decree was already in-place before the Ethiopian Parliament voted on it [2].  For an outside view of a perhaps questionable sources questioning the constitutional aspect of the '\u1260\u1275\u130d\u122b\u12ed \u12e8\u12a0\u1235\u1278\u12b3\u12ed \u130a\u12dc \u12a0\u12cb\u1305' see [3] and [4]. 3) Finally there is the question of what federally imposed means here since the region's government has been replaced by the federal government which seems to have put in place its own state of emergency [5]. The temporary government is also directly accountable to the Federal government [6]. The federal government has recently removed all the people it put in place to run Tigray and the region will not take part in national elections scheduled for next month [7].  So the de facto governing power within Tigray is currently the federal government.

According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\nhttps://www.ethioembassy.org.uk/press-release-on-g7-foreign-ministers-statement-on-the-situation-in-tigray/\nthe Ethiopian federal government has issued a statement at the beginning of April 2021, which assessed the situation under control, even though there was no mention of expiration or extension of the SoE.\n\"The Government of Ethiopia has continued intensifying its efforts to address the situation in the Tigray region and has made enormous progress since the law enforcement measures have come to a successful conclusion. Although these positive developments have been recognized and are visible for all to see, the statement issued by the G7\u2019s Foreign Ministers on 02.04.2021 has failed to capture some of the important steps taken to ensure that the pressing needs of the region are in the process of being fully addressed in all fronts.\"\nThe federal government obviously reacted to a G7 statement critical of the situation and the allegations of war crimes and atrocities, e.g. to be found at Canada's ministry of foreign affairs' global section\nhttps://www.canada.ca/en/global-affairs/news/2021/04/g7-foreign-ministers-statement-on-the-situation-in-tigray-ethiopia.html Although the current situation is completely different with regards to actual violence, it appears that the Abiy Ahmed government, which represents the ethnic majorities in Ethiopia and reflects the parliamentary majority of the \"Prosperity Party\" f.k.a the ERPRD coalition, chose to pretend peace, order and the rule of law for the sake of pretending secure, free and fair elections to be held in their constituencies (all states of Ethiopia except Tigray) to be held on 05 June 2021. The results of this election are foreseeably in favor of the Prosperity Party, now that the TPLF, which is also the only opposition party which had been granted a minority representation by parliament regulation, has been denied access to the elections and their militia arm has been declared terrorists. Pretending peace and calm becomes clear from the following claims as of April:\n/\"enormous progress since the law enforcement measures have come to a successful conclusion.\" overall\n/\"Unfettered access to humanitarian aid\"\n/\"Unfettered access [...] including international media\"\n/\"joint investigation on human rights violations by international human rights experts has also been allowed and will commence soon\"\n/\"the Eritrean troops who had crossed the border when provoked by the TPLF have now started to evacuate\"\n/\"the Ethiopian National Defense Force has taken over guarding the national border\"\n/\"The Interim Administration in collaboration with the Federal Government has also been working tirelessly to be able to bring the governance structure of the region back to full operation\" To make things worse, the federal government makes the international community and a lack of aid responsible for 4.2mn people in Tigray starving if not dying of hunger or as \"collateral damage\" in continued fights. A real state of emergency will likely exist, however, only inofficially, while the country is on the brink of either genocide/\"ethnic cleansing\" or civil war or both. All of this indeed points to a strategic expiration of the federal state of emergency in sharp contrast to the facts on the ground, for the sake of an untainted election result in June 2021 that will secure a one-party parliamentary representation of ethnic majorities in Ethiopia over the next term with all of the 547 seat in the House of Peoples' Representatives (the TPLF refused to join the unity party umbrella in Dec 2019 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosperity_Party).

The most likely time lag is thus the latter one (between adoption and approval) without immediate ability of the HPR of an approval, since there has been no news about any deliberations within 48 hours of the due date of an extension, if the same rules apply to an extension as to the initial declaration. In my view the Ethiopian constitution is somewhat unclear in this point. We'd then have to expect a declaration of an extension no later than possibly 18 May 2021, and I expect the federal SoE to be applied without interruption until then. /the last but remote possibility is that Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed is applying the federal SoE in his own interpretation of the constitution and in an unconstitutional manner. But even this would have found some attention of the media. In all, I assume the federal state of emergency is still in place and will be approved either shortly before the question's resolution or shortly thereafter, anything else would be a surprise. Initiatives such as the call for peace of the Ethiopian Orthodox church patriarch may be a sign of goodwill, but will offer no immediate relief of the tensions let alone solve the underlying problems. The most recent central government's actions, such as the designation of the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) as a terrorist group, and the replacement of the former head of interim government of the state of Tigray will not increase mutual trust needed for a solution via negotiations within less than a week.

An outbreak of violence could take place not only in Tigray, but also in other Ethiopian states. \n\"Another factor suggesting the conflict will continue is that the federal government has not fully achieved its key intervention objectives: to disarm the TPLF, prosecute all wanted Tigrayan leaders and re-establish a constitutional government in Tigray. With elections in Ethiopia (excluding Tigray) just over two months away, Abiy is likely to worry that he will look weak if he submits to talks with a fugitive Tigrayan leadership that his government has classified as treasonous. Moreover, Abiy faces little domestic pressure to change course. The war in Tigray enjoys broad popular support in much of Ethiopia and, outside Tigray itself, Abiy has successfully cast the TPLF as villains who have been sowing the seeds of civil strife for the past two years. Nonetheless, whether Eritrean troops maintain a presence or not, Addis Ababa seems unlikely to dislodge the Tigray Defence Forces from rural areas and convince Tigrayans to curtail their support for the resistance. The sad reality is that the war looks set to grind on, probably for months, if not longer, absent significant action by outside powers to bring it to a close.\"\nhttps://www.thenigerianvoice.com/news/297454/ethiopias-tigray-war-a-deadly-dangerous-stalemate.html /\"Following weeks of conflict, Ethiopian federal forces declared victory over the northern Tigray region\u2019s leadership after taking the capital Mekelle on 28 November 2020. The army says it is mopping up, although ousted Tigrayan leaders and the UN say fighting is still widespread. The war has killed thousands and displaced maybe a third of Tigray\u2019s population amid reports of atrocities by all sides. More than 4.5 million people in Tigray reportedly require emergency food aid and hundreds of thousands could starve. Federal troops are backed by Amhara factions claiming areas they say Tigray annexed in the early 1990s. It is now apparent that Eritrean troops intervened to support Ethiopia\u2019s army, though both Asmara and Addis Ababa deny it. Whether or not the federal government achieves all its military goals, it will need to work with chunks of Tigray\u2019s former regional administration and win popular acceptance to avoid being seen as an occupying force. It should curtail the Amhara and Eritrean troop presences and let aid flow.

First, six months would mean the SoE ends May 4, 2021, which would mean there would need to be an extension. I did some reading and one source tells me they could have extended this SoE at any time before it expires, at 4-month intervals. I question why they have not done so already, and there seems to be no wide discussions about it. This is information to support not extending the SoE. On the other hand, there seems to be a newly appointed leader of the State of Emergency Task Force - or something along that title, as of early March, 2021. This would be more likely in the case that they would be extending the SoE. In the previous SoE, it was extended but canceled early in light of peaceful and more secure progress. In relation to the current progress, there seems not to be of such. Therefore, a newly appointed leader on the Task Force would mean reinvigorated efforts to maintain the SoE through May and beyond until an obvious state of security is achieved. Other remarks that may be influential:\n- There are human rights abuses investigations going on in the country.\n- There is increased humanitarian aid focus in the country.\n- There are global demonstrations that the government is actively highlighting in its media.\n- There are allegations that the government is starving its people to starve out the enemies.\n- Many of Ethiopian conflicts last a period of decades, so in 2 months that will be only relatively little progress toward a conclusion to the conflict even considering that it began in November 2020.\n- There is some kind of election(s) in June (the month following the expiration month), so public perception on SoE may influence extension. And most importantly, in my judgement, the rising COVID cases in the country as of this update will mean greater support to maintain or enact a new COVID State of Emergency.\n**********\nHere is a great day-by-day timeline of events going on in the area\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Tigray_War It would make sense to renew the SoE.

From Article 93:\n (4) (a) When a state of emergency is declared, the Council of Ministers shall, in accordance with regulations it issues, have all necessary power to protect the country's peace and sovereignty, and to maintain public security, law and order.\n(b) The Council of Ministers shall have the power to suspend such political and democratic rights contained in this Constitution to the extent necessary to avert the conditions that required the declaration of a state of emergency.\n(c) In the exercise of its emergency powers the Council of Ministers can not, however, suspend or limit the rights provided for in Articles 1, 18, 25, and sub-articles 1 and 2 of Article 39 of this Constitution.
