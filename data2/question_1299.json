Unfortunately for the new equilibrium point the mean is close to the bucket division of 120 seats. This question has now become an effective Brier-score killer. Before I end, I would like to notice the much better election simulation by Kiko Llaneras in [2], in which they simulate province by province (the basic electoral district in Spain). His prediction is a 90% probability within the 90 to 139 seat range, with the mean located at 116. This would moderately change how to fill the buckets, with the biggest probability in the 108-120 range.

Spain uses the D'Hondt method [1], which slightly favors larger parties [2]. Spain's electoral system also has some particularities that are difficult to incorporate into a model: \"A party must obtain a minimum of 3 percent of the vote in order to qualify for parliamentary representation. Each province is to have a minimum of two seats in the Congress of Deputies, plus one additional seat for every 144,500 inhabitants or fraction over 70,000 inhabitants...This system tends to overrepresent the more traditional, rural, and thinly populated parts of Spain and to favor the larger parties, which also benefit from the system of postelectoral subsidies.\" [3]  I tried to account for the particularities of Spain's electoral system by finding the estimated error in #seats from: the actual #seats allotted to each party in the past three elections vs. the hypothetical #seats allotted to each party in the past three elections if all of Spain were a single, completely unified proportional system. I combined this output with the average of polling (from Politico's poll of polls) to get a final result of ~121 seats [4]. I am not extremely confident in this model as it is very crude in its approximation of Spain's electoral system, so I assigned a standard deviation of 5.5 to this value. I then used a normal distribution calculator [5] to find the probabilities I should assign to each bin.

First, let me explain my method: I have averaged the last few electoral polls, from 15 September till past week and find the variance. However I do not give each electoral poll the same weight: the most recent ones carry more weight. If they have been done in the last week, I give them a weight of 1, if they have been done more than one week ago but less than two weeks ago, I give them a weight of 1/2, etc. The results from the electoral polls are taken from [1] (in Spanish), which halfway down contains a typical pie chart for the congress seats and where one can choose a concrete poll (it indicates the dates), after which the number of seats predicted in that particular poll will appear. It should be easy to use for non-spanish speakers (it does not require much Spanish to find the pie-distribution figure of the congress). The weighted outcome with the weighting procedure I have used is: mu = 125.1, sigma = 3.7 Then for the sigma, I must add the intrinsic sigma of each poll, which probably averages on two seats (as can be appreciated in the few polls that give you a range of seats instead of a single number). Assuming no correlation, this translates into a total sigma = 4.2 Then I simply find the probability in each of the brackets (but one needs to take into account that, for instance, \"120 included\" would translate into 119.5 or more, as we are approximating with a continuous probability distribution). This is however the outside view. For the inside (or should I say, mixed inside-outside) view I would recommend a recent article by Kiko Llaneras [2], where he indicates that there is a downward tendency in the voting intentions to the socialist party. This could be taken into account by trying to extrapolate the means of the polls done in different moments of time, but I have not done such an exercise yet. Edit 1: by taking the four polls made last week and the six polls made three weeks ago, the mean has gone down by 1.25 seats. This would naively translate into five seats in the four weeks resting to the elections. However, this has to be compounded with the inherent error of the polls and the previous error after averaging, meaning that it's not clear how to translate this into a statistically sound time evolution of the voting intention.
