As has also been stated, this case isn't about the death penalty, but about Voir Dire, which means this case is actually about the 6th Amendment, which (among other things), guarantees Americans the right to an impartial jury [1]. This is important because at least one justice, Gorsuch, claims to be a textualist. Justice Gorsuch has ruled on Voir Dire before, but, only insofar as how attorney's conduct Voir Dire, not how judges conduct Voir Dire [2]. In that case Gorsuch ruled against the defendants claims that his attorney did not conduct a thorough enough Voir Dire because the judge conducted a very thorough Voir Dire. In this case, the appellate court found that the judge did not conduct a thorough Voir Dire. More specifically, it seems likely that this case falls short of the Mcdonough test's ex-Ante view which states that, \"An ex-ante view of juror bias, rather than focusing on the end result of a juror's bias, alleges that the constitutional infringement happened before the partial juror was ever seated on the jury.\" [3]. This is important to this particular case because the appellate court found that the trial judges failure to allow the defense to ask specific questions about a jurors possible bias due to media coverage of the case allowed for two potential jurors, who had made biased social media posts about the case, to be seated as jurors [4]. This seems like an obvious violation of the defendants 6th Amendment rights due to the trial judges decision to limit Voir Dire. With that said, I expect this case to be a 5-4 ruling with Gorsuch and Roberts ruling with the liberal justices, though it could be 6-3 or 7-2, depending on how original/textual Coney-Barret and Kavanaugh decide to be or how closely they follow Scalia's rulings. Thus, I assess a 5% probability that SCOTUS will reinstate the death sentence because I believe at least one of the three \"Scalia influenced\" Justices will agree with the appellate courts ruling.
