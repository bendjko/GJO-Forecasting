New cases peaked on January 8th 2021 at 294,000 cases (6.7% infection rate). On January 11, 2021 the 7-day moving average peaked at 250,541 daily cases (a 3 day lag between the peak cases and peak 7-day average). It was May 1, 2021 before the 7-day moving average dropped below 50K daily cases. I don't do math, so I am going to say generally that 7-day moving average cases decreased by 80% over 110 days.  This article from January 6, 2022 suggests that the US Omicron variant peak could be in the next few weeks, followed by a rapid decline in cases as evidenced by current observations in South Africa and the UK. This sentiment is being reported widely, so I take it at face value that the statement is *generally* accurate given the really smart doctors and scientists weighing in. For planning purposes I will assume the US will peak in new daily COVID cases on or about January 20, 2022, based on the swift reaction across parts of the US to contain the infection rate. https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2022/01/omicron-could-peak-in-u-s-fairly-soon-maybe/  I am also assuming that the decline in cases will follow the trend of the previous January 2021 surge in terms of rate. I attribute rate (increase or decline) as a factor of the size, demographics, density, and ideological / political leanings of our country, which have not changed much since last January. Specifically, I dont think there will be a sharper decline in the 7-day average.

Data suggests the rate of increase is dropping precipitously. I am 90% sure the next growth rate will be more than 5% but less than 19% so I intend to say the growth through Jan 20th will be 12%.

New cases peaked on January 8th 2021 at 294,000 cases (6.7% infection rate). On January 11, 2021 the 7-day moving average peaked at 250,541 daily cases (a 3 day lag between the peak cases and peak 7-day average). It was May 1, 2021 before the 7-day moving average dropped below 50K daily cases. I don't do math, so I am going to say generally that 7-day moving average cases decreased by 80% over 110 days.  This article from January 6, 2022 suggests that the US Omicron variant peak could be in the next few weeks, followed by a rapid decline in cases as evidenced by current observations in South Africa and the UK. This sentiment is being reported widely, so I take it at face value that the statement is *generally* accurate given the really smart doctors and scientists weighing in. For planning purposes I will assume the US will peak in new daily COVID cases on or about January 20, 2022, based on the swift reaction across parts of the US to contain the infection rate. https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2022/01/omicron-could-peak-in-u-s-fairly-soon-maybe/  I am also assuming that the decline in cases will follow the trend of the previous January 2021 surge in terms of rate. I attribute rate (increase or decline) as a factor of the size, demographics, density, and ideological / political leanings of our country, which have not changed much since last January. Specifically, I dont think there will be a sharper decline in the 7-day average.  As of January 7, 2022 new cases were reported at 831,304 with a 7-day moving average of 668,497 (18.16% infection rate).  CDC data suggests that the 7-day moving average recorded on January 5, 2022 had increased 85.7% from the previous week. Assuming that rate of infection remains stable through January 20, 2022, I can estimate the 7-day moving average to be in the neighborhood of 1.088M on January 12, 2022, and 2.021M on January 19, 2022.  So - how many days to go from 2.021M average new cases on the 7-day average, down to 49.9K? Using my terribly rudimentary rate, I project the 7-day moving average to be: 2,021,000 on Jan 20, 2022\n404,200 on May 9, 2022\n80,840 on August 26, 2022 My lack of confidence in my math skill is what leads me to project a 58% chance we will drop below 50K by 31 July.

Given these two variables, Omicron and our winter season are complete wild cards (being a La Ni\u00f1a year), so it\u2019s hard to say how COVID will spread this winter. If it stays cold through February and into March, COVID most likely will continue to wreak havoc until the humidity/heat rises. Additionally, if it stays cold and/or another variant emerges due to the rapid Omicron spread, this question wont resolve until summer.  Omicron seems to peak quickly, but it\u2019s hard to predict our particular path right now against data from other countries, since we don\u2019t have comparable healthcare/public health systems or the same mandates in place.
