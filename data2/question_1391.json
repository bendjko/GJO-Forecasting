just found some reports about a 810mn USD federal transportation contract that UBER and LYFT have closed. But that can't be the reason for a 50% jump in stock price. Then I discovered that even TSLA was traded at 750USD for the same few minutes...\nhttps://www.sg-zertifikate.de/webforms/images/cache/ChartImg/MaxAge1min/USD_TSLA/USD_TSLA/USD_TSLA/CBUL_Bid_Intraday.png\nThe Nasdaq100 indication didn't move much.\nProbably a few more selected stocks from the tech sector did the jump (I found it for Apple, Alphabet, Alibaba, Amazon (traded at 4,400USD (!) 8-)) but also Boeing, Cisco, eBay, facebook,...), which may have functioned like a \"reverse flash crash\" and cause heavy losses to a few brokers and/or FinTechs - maybe it'll be named the \"Flash bang of Nov 24,2020\". Obviously, what just happened is either the result of a cyberattack, a fat finger trade, or an automated portfolio management/algorithmic trading machine gone wild. Maybe one of the market makers got confused with currencies (operational risk, which should definitely not happen) and placed an iceberg order denominated in EUR but with the USD-value instead - which was then filled immediately. Or some traders, who use trading systems where you leave out the first two digits when entering the price limit for speed's sake, interpreted the figures the wrong way: it's easy to figure out, how an order for TSLA limited at [5][2]7.50USD turns into a 750.00USD order. Or one for UBER at a limit of [5][0].72USD turns into an order at 72.00USD. I'd love to review the full order books and times'n'sales tables now.\nI'm pretty sure we'll read about this later.\nEDIT: It seems this mirage was a technical issue at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale's internal price aggregation and has not caused any sales on stock exchanges."], [1646, "2020-11-24T03:08:44Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.03, 0.82, 0.15], ""], [1646, "2020-11-24T03:08:05Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.55, 0.45, 0.0], ""], [25141, "2020-11-23T22:22:08Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.45, 0.55], ""], [87880, "2020-11-23T21:49:18Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.42, 0.58], ""], [20044, "2020-11-23T20:44:29Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.41, 0.57], ""], [79591, "2020-11-23T18:20:30Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.64, 0.31], ""], [88452, "2020-11-23T16:48:28Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.76, 0.24], ""], [80764, "2020-11-23T15:53:03Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.42, 0.53], ""], [96450, "2020-11-23T15:18:32Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.4, 0.5], ""], [13306, "2020-11-23T09:13:21Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.45, 0.5], ""], [25141, "2020-11-23T08:05:23Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.52, 0.47], ""], [1333, "2020-11-22T14:41:19Z", [0.0, 0.04, 0.54, 0.34, 0.08], ""], [1333, "2020-11-22T14:24:07Z", [0.0, 0.04, 0.54, 0.35, 0.07], ""], [96318, "2020-11-22T11:16:51Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.06, 0.44, 0.5], ""], [87880, "2020-11-22T05:39:32Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.45, 0.55], ""], [88766, "2020-11-21T22:03:59Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.8], ""], [691, "2020-11-21T19:05:43Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.38, 0.54, 0.08], ""], [38094, "2020-11-21T16:16:59Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.4, 0.6], "I give up."], [60948, "2020-11-21T12:57:45Z", [0.0, 0.04, 0.04, 0.27, 0.65], ""], [19260, "2020-11-20T18:51:52Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [96450, "2020-11-20T18:43:01Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.45, 0.45], ""], [80764, "2020-11-20T18:37:33Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.4, 0.5], ""], [87064, "2020-11-20T17:40:09Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [691, "2020-11-20T16:12:45Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.4, 0.45, 0.15], ""], [1333, "2020-11-20T15:34:24Z", [0.0, 0.04, 0.55, 0.35, 0.06], ""], [80475, "2020-11-20T13:49:35Z", [0.01, 0.04, 0.05, 0.3, 0.6], "It's currently $86 billion.

Broadly, the markets tends to move higher over time. They also tend not to move dramatically in the short term, absent unexpected, significant news.  So, what is the likelihood that Uber will decline ~9% (to get below $80bn) over the next 6 weeks? There are no more expected potential catalysts (e.g., an earnings release) for a large move in the stock price, so: a) either some unexpected and highly significant negative news about Uber is released over the next few weeks (~5% chance?) b) or Uber stock price is pulled down as part of a broader market decline (note that given their beta is >1, it wouldn't necessarily take a 9% market decline for Uber's stock price to decline the same).  On the one hand there seems to be an obvious and known catalyst for a downturn as a result of COVID (news of an increase in unemployment claims for the first time in 5 weeks today[1] among a backdrop of rapidly rising cases and deaths), but on the other, the market has been surprisingly resilient through this crisis as a result of Fed intervention and things like vaccine optimism. If I could predict whether or not the market will experience a substantial decline over the next 6 weeks with any accuracy, I'd be running a hedge fund rather than making forecasts here, but let's call the odds of a broader market decline a little worse than 50/50, given the aforementioned bias towards rising markets (~40% chance?) In total, a ~45% chance of a decline in Uber's stock price large enough to drop it from the top bin, and my gut says that's being generous.  Full disclosure: I have long been (and continue to be) very bearish on Uber (Herbert Horan's analysis is very persuasive[2]), but need to learn my lesson - even if you're 100% right about something like this, getting the timing right is more luck than skill - just ask Bill Ackman[3] [1] https://www.marketwatch.com/story/u-s-jobless-claims-jump-31-000-to-742-000-amid-record-coronavirus-surge-11605793299?mod=home-page\n[2] http://horanaviation.com/Uber.html\n[3] https://www.investopedia.com/news/billionaire-bill-ackman-dumps-herbalife-ending-5year-war-betting-against-it/"], [60948, "2020-11-19T10:44:52Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.05, 0.25, 0.65], ""], [78829, "2020-11-19T05:25:48Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.47, 0.51, 0.02], ""], [96450, "2020-11-18T22:25:54Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.4], ""], [20044, "2020-11-18T19:08:33Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.03, 0.47, 0.5], ""], [20156, "2020-11-18T14:01:03Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.2, 0.6], ""], [25141, "2020-11-18T10:41:28Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.5, 0.45], ""], [80764, "2020-11-18T09:43:53Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.4], ""], [31275, "2020-11-17T21:34:12Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.3, 0.4, 0.3], ""], [1333, "2020-11-17T14:22:07Z", [0.01, 0.04, 0.55, 0.35, 0.05], ""], [79591, "2020-11-17T13:30:19Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.7, 0.25], ""], [86358, "2020-11-17T05:39:58Z", [0.01, 0.01, 0.05, 0.29, 0.64], ""], [96073, "2020-11-17T05:38:23Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [67403, "2020-11-16T20:45:20Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.9], ""], [96450, "2020-11-16T16:44:43Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.43, 0.37], ""], [25141, "2020-11-16T10:15:54Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.15, 0.5, 0.35], ""], [13306, "2020-11-16T08:54:03Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.07, 0.38, 0.55], ""], [58508, "2020-11-16T03:08:30Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.3, 0.55], ""], [31275, "2020-11-16T00:47:54Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.5, 0.45], ""], [60948, "2020-11-15T19:12:06Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.3, 0.55], ""], [60948, "2020-11-15T19:11:15Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.6], ""], [60948, "2020-11-15T18:15:12Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.35, 0.5], ""], [691, "2020-11-15T15:42:20Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.56, 0.34, 0.0], ""], [56, "2020-11-15T15:01:11Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.85, 0.15], "@LokiOdinevich "], [61367, "2020-11-15T08:21:41Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.15, 0.35, 0.5], ""], [66692, "2020-11-15T07:09:16Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.4, 0.55], ""], [87880, "2020-11-15T00:15:13Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.4, 0.6], ""], [60948, "2020-11-15T00:13:53Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.2, 0.35, 0.4], "Hard not to give >50% to higher than current valuation (per EMH).

The argument goes: if Uber added zero market cap during a 30% rally, how well will it do when the stock market as a whole invariably gives back some gains? But back to the article. Sarah O\u2019Connor argues that \"gig companies are hardly making excess profit by exploiting workers. The reality is stranger than that. They charge customers so little that every big gig company loses money, even with their labour costs compressed. The bigger they get, the more money they lose. The prospectus for Uber\u2019s initial public offering last year showed that in some cases, the company actually pays drivers more than the fare it charges to customers.\" \"The existential question for gig companies is how much demand will remain for their services when they stop being unfeasibly cheap.\" and \"The gig economy wasn\u2019t the future of work after all. In fact, it might not have a future at all.\" But read it for yourself here: https://www.ft.com/content/11e2e1bf-c1dd-47cc-81b2-2147433ff16d Previous forecast 7/60/33/0/0, change to 8/62/30/0/0.

December 2020 is a long way away for there is a lot of uncertainty. Like other tech unicorns, I think the major impact on the product side has been had. Unless driving cars are adopted en masse AND Uber is able to capitalize on this, I don't see a lot of options for major growth. The market has largely reached saturation and we're left with Lyft and Uber mainly. I see the rest of their business options (food delivery, scooters, misc. acquisitions) as marginal to their overall value.  What else can they do? Uber a helicopter?   Losing 10 billion from it's market cap is also unlikely.  We can do a lot of analysis, but the outside view is something like: how many companies have lost more than $10 billion in a year? Not many, and it's usually due to some rare event- a natural disaster, government change, etc. I am optimistic on the company's drive to maintain market share. Local government taxes and such may drive demand down slightly, but I don't think we're going to see a resurgence from the Taxi industry.  The services they offer are real. I'm surprised to see so many forecasters making such a pessimistic prediction, and I'd like to know their reasons.
