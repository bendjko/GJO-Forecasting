That said I don't understand the confidence here. For one around 20% of voters appear to be undecided, and another 25% did not answer. So there's a lot of potential votes out there that we can't be sure about. For another, even if we assume that George Forsyth of National Restoration is guaranteed to go to the runoff, his competitor seems very much up in the air. The next 6 best-polling parties range from 3.78% of those polled to 5.84% in the last five polls. I would imagine the margin of error on the poll encompasses that range. And 3 of the 6 are their own buckets outside the \"another candidate\" bucket, and the ones with their own buckets actually hold seats in parliament, which leads me to believe they're likely to be better recognized and may pull more of the undecided voters. Alternatively they could be more hated and pull fewer of the undecided voters, hard to say. Hard to say what will happen, but I think there's a very strong possibility that a candidate from one of the bigger parties makes it to the runoff, and if that happens it's very possible that the remainder of the voters back that candidate instead of Forsyth. And this isn't just a hypothetical, looking into what happened in the 2016 presidential election Fujimori won the first round with a strong 39.85% while her competitor Kuczynski had 21.05%, but in the runoff Kuczynski went on to win with 50.12% of the vote to Fujimori's 49.88%. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Peruvian_general_election#Main_presidential_candidates Link to google sheet with the polling and parliament breakdown: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AVwUu_XrJCKJrmUntHuCzRg86XCAl6h8cu__YqBUubQ/edit?usp=sharing"], [94872, "2021-02-08T03:52:46Z", [0.01, 0.01, 0.07, 0.11, 0.79, 0.01], ""], [98352, "2021-02-07T15:51:07Z", [0.4, 0.6, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [96318, "2021-02-07T10:51:44Z", [0.04, 0.05, 0.07, 0.08, 0.74, 0.02], ""], [88452, "2021-02-06T19:13:09Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.04, 0.96, 0.0], ""], [34959, "2021-02-06T13:56:34Z", [0.01, 0.01, 0.06, 0.15, 0.76, 0.01], ""], [94872, "2021-02-06T03:23:44Z", [0.01, 0.01, 0.07, 0.14, 0.76, 0.01], ""], [691, "2021-02-05T17:41:40Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.06, 0.18, 0.76, 0.0], ""], [86715, "2021-02-05T14:09:59Z", [0.0, 0.02, 0.02, 0.0, 0.96, 0.0], ""], [94872, "2021-02-04T06:00:54Z", [0.02, 0.02, 0.09, 0.16, 0.7, 0.01], ""], [914, "2021-02-04T03:54:12Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.65, 0.15], ""], [46339, "2021-02-03T19:16:53Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.15, 0.15, 0.7, 0.0], ""], [94872, "2021-02-03T05:23:41Z", [0.02, 0.02, 0.1, 0.16, 0.69, 0.01], ""], [98081, "2021-02-02T21:04:47Z", [0.16, 0.09, 0.02, 0.04, 0.68, 0.01], "Based on current polling Forsyth is almost certainly going to get into the run-off but almost certainly not an outright victory so outcome depends on who other run-off candidate is.

Reached the second round in 2011 and 2016, in part due to the support of her disgraced former-dictator father's base, but limited by his unpopularity and her 2018 arrest in the Odebrecht corruption case.
