We must talk about our concerns (on human rights) but there is no need to turn our China policy on its head,\" Armin Laschet told a conference organised by the BDI industry association.\". Interesting to note who the traget audience was in this case, the BDI (German Confederation of Industry) which clearly has a mandate and policy to promote German Industry (https://bit.ly/3qfrnb4). The BDI has a clear approach to PRC and there's no doubt that the BDI aligns with the EU and probably contributed to Merkel's motive to push for the CAI during Germany's term as EU president in 2020. See - https://bit.ly/2TNn1fb It is, of course, possible that Laschet's comments were simply politics and looking to generate support and votes. It is also worth bearing in mind Italy's more recent views and actions on its participation in the Belt & Road initiative by PRC; see https://bit.ly/3qj08w8 / https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=it&tl=en&u=https://formiche.net/2021/06/draghi-g7-via-della-seta-cina/ & https://bit.ly/3d4ph8z / https://bit.ly/3xFi7PT . Italy seems to be struggling with a defined policy towards PRC. That may be the result of numerous different governments ad coalitions over the last 5 years. Nonetheless, Draghi's apparent pivot towards US / G7 may indicate that it is more reluctant to fully support the CAI in the light of PRC's sanctions and wolf diplomacy on 2019/20/21. We may know more about Laschet's position in October assuming he's appointed as Chancellor in the September elections.

That, I believe is a valid question. Thus, considering the recent confusion about who should be the CSU / CDU candidate to succeed Merkel and the recent showing of the Greens in regional elections, Germany may well be in for a change of Chancellor and dominant political party.  The Greens? Maybe. It would seem they will carry more weight even if one assume that the current coalition retains the chancellorship. Thus, in all likelihood, there will be a change of focus in German politics, IMO. See https://bit.ly/3gzHfTa. Equally, one should not exclude increased influence from the AfD. This all seems to portend a change in German politics that is likely to disrupt the current cosy relationship between the business and ruling classes. Will this be good for Germany's support of the CAI? a Merkel flagship project in her terminal days and her last term as EU President? I do not think so.  This also raises the questions of \ni) how the EU will interact with USA now there is a new administration in office in Washington?\nii) whether or not the current CAI, as we know of it considering many important details are unknown, is fit for the 21st century and the digital world?\niii) will there be a conflict between the EU's climate objectives and China's actual, as opposed to announced, climate objectives? There are some additional questions I have, such as whether the EU Parliament will consider further debate on the CAI after having some of its members sanctioned by China? Or, with the hit the EU economies are taking from the 3rd (and maybe more) Covid-19 waves, does the CAI become a document gathering dust until such time as the EU economies are looking better? And, how will China handle the proposed global digital tax proposed by the new Biden administration? This is a policy the EU has been keen on for sometime and the Biden administration has a proposal that could suit EU from a tax perspective but will China play ball? Lastly, for now, what is China's historical track record regarding adherence to trade agreements? Pretty poor from what I read.  The EU Parliament (EUP) has already delayed some discussion on the CAI. Some political groupings in the EUP have suggested that China sign up to ILO (International Labour Organisation) before they will consider further discussion on the CAI. This suggests some reluctance in EUP to pursue CAI as a result of recent events. See these articles; https://bit.ly/3tNg8Yu / https://bit.ly/3etehla / https://bit.ly/3sMuGpG / https://reut.rs/3epy4lj / https://politi.co/3dM0IhG / https://bit.ly/3vcFBuC This next point could be the issue that the EUP will drag its feet on and which may will create a problem for any new German administration in which the Greens have more influence: \"Sustainable development  This is the third pillar, which has been widely criticized by the media and civil society. It includes provisions on labour, climate, corporate social responsibility (CSR). There is a commitment not to lower norms and rules in order to attract investment or to prevent investments from happening. One needs to acknowledge that within CAI, China has taken new international commitments, notably to \"make sustained and continuous efforts\" to ratify ILO conventions on forced labour. One may have doubts about China\u2019s willingness to implement what is an open-ended commitment without a set deadline. The CAI has the merit to open the conversation officially. But as we see in the next section, the main issue with commitments made under the issue of sustainable development is that they have much weaker implementation provisions, and next to no enforcement or remedial capacity.\"  (see https://bit.ly/3gyMWAx) Most tellingly is this quote: \" Enforcement and dispute resolution Herein lies the devil. On the surface, the CAI mirrors arrangements made with other Asian partners - Japan, Korea, Vietnam. And some of its gaps are also common to those treaties. But China is a partner of a different nature and scale.  The first shortcoming is the lack of an investment protection section - which would seem to be the first requirement for any investment agreement. This is not entirely unknown - the EU-Japan FTA also had a delayed investment protection chapter. The politically expedient reason is that the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has ruled, after the issue came up in the EU-Singapore FTA, that investment protection is a shared EU and member state competence. As a result, a CAI that would include investment protection would need to be ratified by national parliaments in addition to the European Parliament. Moreover, the EU, since the difficulties incurred over the EU-Canada Comprehensive Trade Agreement (CETA), has excluded traditional investor-to-state dispute settlement (ISDS). The ECJ has in fact ruled out any legal process opposing an EU citizen with a state that does not implement the rule of law - and that clearly includes China. Even today, CETA is only partially in force, and several EU member state legislatures have yet to ratify it. Instead, the EU promotes an International Court System (ICS) that was part of the final deal with Canada. It is currently present in the FTAs with Singapore and Vietnam \u2013 none of which have been ratified by all member states as of now. The negotiation of an investment protection chapter with Japan has been stalled since April 2019 over the ICS issue. And China - which has basically accepted WTO dispute resolution because it is a key interest for the world\u2019s largest exporter to seek legal protection - is notoriously reluctant towards international legal processes in many areas. For instance, it has established its own arbitration courts for disputes connected with One Belt One Road financing and projects. \" (see previous reference; https://bit.ly/3gyMWAx).  This begs the question that if the Canada, japan etc agreements are not yet fully agreed by some member states and / or implemented because of the ECJ ruling, why would the CIA be any different? Thus, until I see some more convincing info, I've increased the probability of my 3rd bucket. The first paragraph of the conclusion in this last quoted article summarises the CIA quiet succinctly. Considering the source of this article, the Paris based Institut Montaigne (https://bit.ly/3vdzx4V), I'd suggest that some, if not many, members of EUP have been circulated with this analysis which appears to confirm some of the views already aired recently by EUP members.  @Wildwood2000 / @SE_Meyer / @sebawi  you may find some of this interesting."], [3429, "2021-04-23T13:29:10Z", [0.05, 0.85, 0.1], "maintaining current forecast"], [27661, "2021-04-22T14:29:21Z", [0.0, 0.7, 0.3], ""], [94872, "2021-04-22T04:31:50Z", [0.03, 0.85, 0.12], ""], [100731, "2021-04-21T16:29:28Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [100273, "2021-04-21T12:25:34Z", [0.0, 0.6, 0.4], "The Fall Flu season will swing this."], [88868, "2021-04-21T10:40:04Z", [0.1, 0.8, 0.1], "The EU always delays ratification"], [100715, "2021-04-20T23:53:58Z", [0.05, 0.15, 0.8], "This is an economic proxy conflict between the United States and China.

In fact given the political situation and the fact the Winter Olympics seem to be being discussed as a tool to pressure China on human rights it might be easier to quietly avoid getting this agreement too caught up in that discuss and let it slip a year. Therefore the likelihood of this agreement being signed this year is a lot smaller. https://www.china-briefing.com/news/eu-china-investment-deal-in-doubt-businesses-caught-in-geopolitical-crossfire/"], [691, "2021-04-15T19:41:00Z", [0.08, 0.92, 0.0], ""], [56170, "2021-04-15T13:49:37Z", [0.8, 0.2, 0.0], ""], [27661, "2021-04-15T10:41:52Z", [0.0, 0.8, 0.2], ""], [100415, "2021-04-14T08:19:01Z", [0.15, 0.85, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2021-04-14T07:23:24Z", [0.01, 0.99, 0.0], ""], [62808, "2021-04-13T22:51:17Z", [0.0, 0.4, 0.6], ""], [96757, "2021-04-13T18:20:41Z", [0.0, 0.9, 0.1], ""], [27661, "2021-04-13T11:16:12Z", [0.0, 0.75, 0.25], ""], [3429, "2021-04-12T16:45:52Z", [0.05, 0.85, 0.1], "maintaining current forecast\n"], [93028, "2021-04-11T07:46:46Z", [0.02, 0.86, 0.12], ""], [85097, "2021-04-10T19:28:14Z", [0.0, 0.82, 0.18], ""], [88452, "2021-04-10T01:39:39Z", [0.0, 0.88, 0.12], ""], [94606, "2021-04-09T22:33:00Z", [0.0, 0.4, 0.6], ""], [94872, "2021-04-09T05:04:22Z", [0.03, 0.8, 0.17], ""], [27661, "2021-04-08T21:01:09Z", [0.0, 0.75, 0.25], ""], [96318, "2021-04-08T20:13:13Z", [0.0, 0.85, 0.15], ""], [94606, "2021-04-08T15:44:09Z", [0.0, 0.5, 0.5], "While the EU apparently snubbed the Biden administration, the Biden administration has moved ahead with its own plans to counteract the PRC hegemony plans.

However, sanctioning members of all the major groups of the EU parliament was perhaps an 'own goal'. That's a view that appears to be gaining traction.See https://youtu.be/uGtlum1u2KU at 52:15.  Interestingly, the FT Chief foreign commentator points out that China is the most important market for Volkswagen and Daimler Benz. I am sure China is aware of that and hence realises it has some leverage in the EU. Regardless of who replaces Merkel as Chancellor.  Quoted in that video is this article; https://bit.ly/3dID9F5 and https://bit.ly/3dID9F5. These explore the possibility of the west creating an 'economic' NATO to take on China. The latter article also raises the issue of whether China has challenged the west too soon and may have been better off biding its time until the west was too integrated and reliant on China. To quote; \"China\u2019s sanctions on five MEPs are particularly ill-judged. The decision increases the possibility that the European parliament will not ratify the EU-China Investment Agreement.\" While that may be true and it also may be true that China's recent actions in Hong Kong, it's bullying of ASEAN countries i the South China Seas, it' exorbitant tariffs against Australian goods and it's ongoing threats to Taiwan may well wake up the west to the true intentions of China. This places the EU in a difficult situation apropos the CAI if indeed the west does start coalescing into an alliance to push back against China. That begs the question; does China really care enough about the CAI and the EU? Some hold the view that the reason the CAI made progress in 2020 was simply Germany's powerhouse companies in the auto, finance and tech spheres pushing for greater access. Whether that holds water or not, there is certainly room for concern in Washington about the EU's rush to conclude the CAI - https://bit.ly/3fNCi8D. TThis view is also held outside Washington (https://bit.ly/3tblnk8) . That begs the question; in the aftermath of Brexit, was Merkel a) wanting to ensure her legacy and b) was she wanting to ensure that German companies could find a bigger market which hither to before now was proving difficult to 'crack'? If b) is the case, will the EU simply accept China's criticism and curtail pointing to China's human rights abuses in order to ensure the CAI is approved by both sides? The EU parliament doesn't seem to think so, as I referenced in one of my earlier forecasts.  Thus, in my view, this complex situation has many elements  that must still fall into place, or at least show themselves as potential elements, before I make a more definitive forecast. @Wildwood2000 I have yet to spread my research even wider but this may be the starting point @sebawi & @SE_Meyer what are your thoughts on this? and in particular Xi's comments of today? A recent call between Merkel and Xi (https://reut.rs/3rZqMtc) in my reading seems to suggest that Xi is being quite forceful and suggesting that Merkel must get 'her people', i.e. the EU in order if the CAI is to proceed.

This was met with shock, if not fury\u2014 and that was even before the agreement was published. Those hoping for reinvigorated transatlantic relations between the EU and the USA following Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration were disappointed. Biden\u2019s National Security Advisor pleaded that \u2018[t]he Biden-Harris administration would welcome early consultations with our European partners on our common concerns about China\u2019s economic practices\u2019. Then there were those fearing that an investment agreement with China would legitimise its human rights record, including its systematic repression of Uighurs and its crackdown on Hong Kong democracy. Members of the European Parliament promptly criticised the deal and hinted that further concessions from China will be needed if it is to be trusted (Para. 1). Following the publication of the text of the EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) on January 22, however, such reactions can be seen in a different light. Firstly, in economic terms, the CAI does not seem to facilitate a substantially closer investment partnership between the EU and China, as it mainly consolidates the parties\u2019 existing commitments under the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Even so, it seeks to address EU Member States\u2019 sustainability concerns by adding pressure on China to comply with International Labour Organisation (ILO) Conventions. While the CAI heralds the EU\u2019s emerging so-called strategic autonomy, generally perceived as a claim to greater independence from strategic and policy choices made by the USA, this does not amount to a fundamental shift in the EU\u2019s policy on China. The CAI will operate in parallel to robust foreign investment screening, to address security concerns, and a new framework for sanctions in response to human rights violations. Secondly, China\u2019s commitment to continue negotiations on a fully-fledged investment protection regime, including reformed investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS), showcases its increasing desire to shape multilateralism, rather than merely be shaped by it. The degree to which the EU will be able to enforce this commitment in a manner which complies with its own values may be the benchmark against which the impact of the CAI will be assessed in the future (Para. 1-3).

For critics, the CAI marks a moment of startling and self-defeating geostrategic naivety on the part of the EU. In their eyes, the agreement needlessly damages the restoration of closer transatlantic ties, while handing CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping a gratuitous PR win, all in the midst of ongoing CCP crackdowns in Xinjiang and Hong Kong.

Seven years ago, few people would have questioned the resilience of the EU-US transatlantic alliance, and any talk of a new cold war between China and the US would have been dismissed as rumour-mongering (Para. 6).\nFast-track to January 2021 and the world is deeply divided and polarised. Both Europe and the United States are battling a pandemic. The World Bank estimated global world output fell 5.2 per cent in 2020 \u2013 the worst since World War II \u2013 although China managed some growth.\nAgainst such a gloomy backdrop, it was no surprise that EU and Chinese leaders were quick to celebrate sealing the landmark deal \u2013 officially called the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI). Though according to critics, while it might be a symbolic victory for Beijing there is little in it for Brussels (Para 8).\n*\nReference\n*\nJiangtao, S. & Wong, C. (2021).

Excluding the three BITs signed in 2020 (as they have not yet had a year to be ratified), there have been 117 BITs signed since January 1, 2016. Of those 117, only 24 have been ratified as of January 1, 2021. Of those 24 ratified, only 11 were ratified in under one year. From a big picture perspective, any given BIT would thus have a 9% chance of being passed in under a year. China has signed 53 BITs since Jan 1, 2000. Of those, I have limited my analysis to industrialized nations as it appears many smaller nations have signed deals with China but have long passages without ratifying them. The paper attached below describes the differences in scope and purpose between the China-Canada BIT and those China has with multiple African nations, which I feel can be applied to most countries that are not industrialized. Of the remaining 13 industrialized nations, the average time between signing and ratification was 23.9 months. 3 of the 13 nations signed in under 1 year (India 9, South Korea 3, and Mexico 9). Thus there would be a 23% chance of the deal being ratified in under 1 year. (This data is also from the above UN link) Averaging these two figures gives a 16% chance of ratification. However, I believe that the difficulty of getting 28 separate heads of state and members of the EU parliament to agree on the deal will present far more difficulty than any of those nations. Thus I have halved again the chances to an 8% chance of ratification before January 1, 2022.
