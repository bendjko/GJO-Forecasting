With about half a year left, this goes down to 2.5%. Adjustments:\n- Death: given his age of 70 [2], he'd have a 2.3% chance of dying in the US [3]. I couldn't find any numbers for Iran.

Adding that to the 2.5% base rate we get 3.9%.\n- This AP article [3] does make it seem as if there was good reason to expect something to happen: \"Nine hard-line lawmakers have put forward a measure to disqualify Rouhani as president. His dismissal would require two-thirds of parliament\u2019s 290 members [...] Iranian law also allows Rouhani to resign, and criminal charges could push him from his post.\" Neither of these seem particularly likely or concrete.

RUHANI will need to implement structural reforms that strengthen the banking sector and improve Iran\u2019s business climate to attract foreign investment and encourage the growth of the private sector. Sanctions that are not related to Iran\u2019s nuclear program remain in effect, and these\u2014plus fears over the possible re-imposition of nuclear-related sanctions\u2014will continue to deter foreign investors from engaging with Iran.\" [4] The economic situation sparked civil unrest, demonstrations and potential political instability: \u201cTehran can\u2019t afford to buy off the protesters while the country is in economic free fall,\u201d...\u201cTrump\u2019s Iran policy has made matters worse for Tehran. 'The sanctions are successful in putting pressure on the regime, shaking the regime'\u201d [5] \"Daily protests continue in Iran, as the economy sinks. \u201cAmerica is not the enemy, the enemy is right here,\u201d say some in the crowds. \" [6] Options:\nScenario one: nothing happens until Khamenei passes on, certainly changes can wait until that moment (why would anyone start any earlier given the situation?). Iran's leaders keep on looking for sanctions to be eased (related or not to the nuclear agreement JCPOA) as desperately needing resources to implement economic measures that relief social pressure. Assuming it takes some time, longer than October 1st: YES 2.5% Cromwell's rule.\nScenario two: same as one, but no uplift of sanctions and unrest increases rapidly, asking for Rouhani's impeachment (long term) or resignation (short term): YES 5%\nScenario three: Khamenei passes on before October 1st (say 40% before August 1st - not sure if it matters but Ramadam this year ends on June 4th) and succession war begins: \"Since December 2017, the IRGC [the Revolutionary Guard] and Rohani have tried to mobilise the public against each other in anticipation of a succession battle.\" [3]. Hardliners and IRGC win, using IRGC economic power and civil society, and Rouhani is removed from position. No idea about how quickly this could be (Khamenei's own appointment was probably already designated by his predecessor, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini) but we can assume it to be quickly after: YES 24%\nScenario four: same as three, but conflict between reformist and clerical government escalates, even possibly to civil war and takes much longer. During this time, Rouhani continues as President. YES: 0%. Total: 31.5% [1] https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/01/13/why-us-must-know-truth-about-health-irans-supreme-leader/?utm_term=.24d81c024df2\n[2] https://nationalinterest.org/feature/irans-battle-over-khameneis-successor-just-getting-started-43252\n[3] https://thearabweekly.com/power-struggle-tehran-ahead-post-khamenei-succession\n[4] https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ir.html\n[5] https://thearabweekly.com/iran-set-see-more-unrest-2019-economy-falters\n[6] https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2019/02/09/four-decades-after-its-revolution-iran-is-still-stuck-in-the-past"], [691, "2019-03-24T11:24:56Z", [0.12], ""], [172, "2019-03-24T02:15:09Z", [0.05], ""], [63963, "2019-03-23T20:53:51Z", [0.05], ""], [34527, "2019-03-23T19:25:36Z", [0.0], ""], [35217, "2019-03-23T18:50:25Z", [0.25], "4 out of 5 previous presidents reached their maximum tenure of 8 years, so an anchor around 20 % seems reasonable.
