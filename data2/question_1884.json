Considering Apple has been the most valuable company for the past 3 years, what would it take to change that? Either Apple's market value shrinks or another company flies past. Apple's market value has grown quarter on quarter consistently over the past 3 years except for Q1 of 2021 and a sharp fall on Q4 2018. However, those quarters were generally weaker for most listed companies (especially the latter) and may well not have to do anything with the companies' performance (sidenote: does market cap really have anything to do with performance anyway?). Average market cap growth % for apple has been 11% for a 3-year period and 16% for 2020. Amazon and Microsoft both get an average 9% rate for a 3-year period and Amazon has a 17% growth rate for 2020 when it picked up a lot of speed. Whereas I see that in the past Apple has been overtaken by Microsoft at some point, the gap between them is larger than it has been over the past 3 years. Based on that history, I'd say it's unlikely for Amazon, Microsoft or Alphabet to beat their own track record and overtake Apple. However, I'll say Amazon's performance merits closer follow-up going forward as the pandemic seems to have boosted its market cap. This leaves me to have a look at two other companies that have not been on this list over the past 3 years. One is Tesla and the other is SA (Saudi Aramco). Tesla has skyrocketed into the top 10 recently but it's hard to assess growth rate as it is a new contender. There's a lot of talk about it but I wonder, will it even pass the $1tn mark in 2021? To go from $806bn to $2tn+ just to contend with Apple would completely unprecedented and would defy any record-breaking growth rates noted above. It'd say it's very unlikely but it would also be wonderful to see. That leaves me with SA. Another tough pick because it doesn't have such a long history in the market. Market cap grew about 9% from 2019 to 2020. It's a bit of a wild car considering it's state-directed and the myriad ramifications of the oil industry. Even Biden's policies on environment and energy may have a knock-on effect on this market cap. At this point, I'll stick to the simple fact that it's growing 9% year-on-year (although that's not a strong reference point) and Apple is still beating that rate. I will keep a very close eye on the oil industry to revise my forecast. So, let's recap. Over the past 3 years, the same company has staid 3 out of 4 months as top-valued and twice has Apple closed as the most valuable. Apple has sat on number 1 for 7 quarters out of 12. So let's start with that. 58% chance Even as a starting point, it's good because the gap between Apple and the rest of American companies at this point is large so there's margin to increase that on the home front.  I'll say there is a 58% chance it's the most valuable in the world and 67% chance that at least remains so in the US (the extra points at home is for the fact that only 1 quarter out of 12 did Apple shrink and any of its competitors stayed stable or manage to perform better). I have to make this fit into the 100/3 format so I'm weighing these probabilities and come up with: \n58% for Apple because I reckon that number stills holds\nOut of the remaining 42%\n26% for remaining the most valuable US company\n16% for no I'm sorry if this was too convoluted but I want to keep a record of my rationale.

Thinking about how this question might become a \"no\" the companies to watch are Saudi Aramco, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Tesla, and Tencent. Apple loses the top spot if one or more of these companies grows faster than Apple, or if Apple loses more market capitalization than at least one of these companies.  I'd put a low probability that Tesla and/or Tencent can catch up by the end of 2021. Those companies are each about a third of Apple's current size. I'd also put a low probability of Microsoft of Google catching Apple this year, seeing as they are all in the same sector and not growing faster than Apple. I've placed 42% chance that SA comes out with the top spot, most likely due to a fall in US equities relative to oil. There's also a chance that SA sells more stock and increases its capitalization that way. Conversely, oil prices could rise rapidly and increase the share price of SA significantly (although a low probability event). I'm adding another 2% to the second option to account for the possibility of another foreign company (maybe Tencent or Alibaba) taking off and passing Apple.  If a foreign company isn't in the top spot, and Apple isn't the top US company, another US company must pass them. The most likely challenger is Amazon, with a current value 38% below Apple. Another possibility is Tesla seeing another tremendous year while Apple does not. Again, the difference in current market cap leads me to think those are not high probability events. I've assigned a combined probability of 7% that at least one of those things happen. If the gap shrinks, I'll adjust those odds higher.   Thinking through this question, it seems like the most sensitive uncertainties are oil prices and Amazon growth.

Pre-COVID, both companies were aligned in Market Cap.\nMy guess is that it will be slightly better for Microsoft or Amazon than for Apple, as business will still need their services, while fewer business will be open, but surely consumers will not need the latest iPhone or iPad.\nSources: https://finance.yahoo.com"], [10612, "2021-01-03T05:57:00Z", [0.45, 0.55, 0.0], ""], [95503, "2021-01-03T01:07:50Z", [0.75, 0.08, 0.17], ""], [172, "2021-01-03T00:46:43Z", [0.85, 0.1, 0.05], ""], [33035, "2021-01-02T18:29:40Z", [0.05, 0.15, 0.8], ""], [68146, "2021-01-02T17:42:14Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.85], ""], [691, "2021-01-02T17:13:24Z", [0.7, 0.15, 0.15], ""], [86897, "2021-01-02T05:07:45Z", [0.78, 0.02, 0.2], ""], [14266, "2021-01-02T03:48:08Z", [0.7, 0.25, 0.05], ""], [50172, "2021-01-02T01:00:49Z", [0.25, 0.4, 0.35], ""], [97638, "2021-01-01T22:26:53Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.9], ""], [97634, "2021-01-01T20:27:29Z", [0.75, 0.0, 0.25], ""], [97584, "2021-01-01T20:20:57Z", [0.6, 0.1, 0.3], ""], [97632, "2021-01-01T20:20:30Z", [0.4, 0.1, 0.5], ""], [97631, "2021-01-01T20:20:29Z", [0.25, 0.15, 0.6], "nah"], [97577, "2021-01-01T20:20:26Z", [0.9, 0.0, 0.1], ""], [97630, "2021-01-01T20:20:17Z", [0.65, 0.25, 0.1], ""], [97627, "2021-01-01T20:18:34Z", [0.8, 0.2, 0.0], ""], [90167, "2021-01-01T17:46:13Z", [0.73, 0.25, 0.02], ""], [60695, "2021-01-01T16:54:55Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [86367, "2021-01-01T11:58:15Z", [0.76, 0.03, 0.21], "Apple seems to be doing really well and the outlook for 2021 seems quite strong too with the macbook launch and another Ipad expected to be launched in Q1 2021. Moreover the iphone 12 has received a good response. Apples earnings have more or less been stagnant in the last 3-4 years. Aramco on the other hand faces a more uncertain year. Earnings and both valuation depend on whats the outlook for oil, also the current valuation that it commands has been artificially boosted by low float( ie the stock actually held by public and institutions) (See links given below). That is primarily why it didnt get listed on an international stock exchange(Very few takers for a $2tn valuation).   Incase there is a swift fall in equity markets that will hit everyone/all over the globe. US wouldnt be an outlier. The only scenario where prospects for Aramco can turn for the better is one where oil prices strengthen(With UAE a traditional ally now eyeing a stronger presence in OPEC) this possibility seems remote.

As KSA has one of the lowest production costs (likely still between 15 to 20USD/bbl)  AND the one of the highest inventory of confirmed reserves worldwide Saudi Aramco's enterprise value will largely depend on the global average crude oil price level: if prices for SA grades rise to 50USD/bbl, then Saudi Aramco's earnings in the worst case will be 60cents on the dollat of sales, if prices climb to as much as 70USD/bbl, a level previously seen in the wake of the Sept 2019 Abqaiq\u2013Khurais attack, its earnings are scaled up to 71cents on the dollar of sales.\nAt a revenue of 329.8bn USD (FY 2019), Saudi had an operating income of 177,8bn USD (53.9%, FY2019) and a net income of 88.2bn USD (26.7% of revenue, FY 2019).\nMost of net income will be distributed as dividend in 2020 again, where both AAPL and Saudi Aramco have a similar peculiarity in their financial position and their financing structure, in that they use debt funding for dividend payments to lower costs of funding.\n\"Aramco said it would distribute a dividend of $18.75 billion for the quarter, in line with its plan to pay a base dividend of $75 billion for 2020.\nBut equity analyst Yousef Husseini at investment bank EFG-Hermes said Aramco would likely have to increase its debt financing in the short- to medium-term, or further cut capital expenditure, in order to be able to maintain the dividend unless oil prices recovered to at least $55 a barrel.\"\nhttps://uk.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-aramco-results-idUKKBN27J0K3 In a simplified model of Saudi Aramco's business, their need for a swift and sustainable recovery of the global oil market in order to turn into the global wealth-generating machine #1 and a cash/dividend transforming laundromat slot-machine (your net notional paid for the stock of today will predictably be reimbursed completely by distributed net income/dividends within the next 15 years) again that the KSA needs becomes obvious:\n/ at an annual production of 600mn bbl of crude and 20USD/bbl constant cost for production (assumed total production would be exported as crude), total cost for production are fixed at 12bn USD annually.\n/ at an annual average crude price (FY2021) of 50USD/bbl, the total production would be valued at a gross value of 30bn USD and a net value of 18bn USD\n/at an annual average crude price (FY2021) of 70USD/bbl, the total production would be valued at a gross value of 42bn USD and a net value of 30bn USD\nThus, a price increase of 40% would cause an increase in value added of roughly 66.7% which means a leverage of more than 1.5.  In reality the majority of profits will be generated in the refinery business, in storing and logistics, and not least Saudi Aramco is a financial superpower that has direct and financial investments likely on all continents; however, the lever Saudi Aramco has in their business is unique and will fully come into play when oil prices surpass 65USD on average (Saudi would then likely surpass Apple's target operating margin of 30% of revenue). It is, however, questionable whether or not 15 years from now (year 2035) the business model of Saudi Aramco will still exist. Further stringent climate action politics in 2021 may lower Saudi Aramco's market cap by a discount of 3-6%, which could in the end be the crucial margin.

This easy money tended to benefit certain places, such as high profile stocks such as FANG stocks. Therefore, any major stock market crash will likely see the opposite effect with a larger amount of value coming out of these overpriced stocks that have benefited the most from this bubble.  I expect both a major stock market correction and a weakening of the dollar, perhaps a collapse of the dollar, in 2021. I expect Apple to still remain the largest us-based company, but I think the crash of the dollar will see apple lose ground against other international companies.  This is difficult to forecast because nothing like this has ever happened before. We have not had a world reserve currency crash in about 70 years, and this time it will be much different than last time. This ship is so massive that it has a lot of momentum and it is hard to know when it will finally sink. I think the deciding blow for the United States system will be rising inflation, and I think it is likely that will really pick up this year.
