This is likely attributable to the UK heatwave, driving people's behavior to bed in less close contact indoors. If you assume an exponential decline in the caseload from the past 5 days, which is when the 7day MA started a downturn, we could plausibly hit under 15,000 cases on the MA by August the 3rd. This precision is not justified, but the margin for error places this well below the 11th of September. This downward trajectory seems unlikely to be sustained, especially if it's driven by the weather (we are due for bleaker times in the near future sadly: https://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/outlook). However, August is still a warm month, which could keep R below one for around a month, which given the sharpness of decline in the caseload, could result in the cases being below 15,000 by September.  This will need to be updated in light of evidence about how sustained the recent downturn is. It could be more likely if it's driven by other factors than the weather, eg school summer holidays. This could be a major factor for two reasons: 1) Students are no longer undergoing routine lateral flow tests,  so less detection of the cases load 2) Less spreading within schools.  Vaccine rollout is still suggestive that the case load could continue declining, especially with recent reports of 90% of adults having antibodies (see first Guardian article above).  Though non of these factors alone is enough to suggest that the R number remains permanently below 1 (see: https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S1473-3099%2821%2900143-2), in combination, there's a reasonable likelihood that the 7 day MA could reach below 15,000 in August. I place the estimate at 50% because recently all restrictions have because R needs to be below 1 for a sustained period of time, longer than it has so far appears to have been, in order to reach this target. Given that all restrictions, and especially with the reopening of nightclubs, it seem's plausible that R would quickly return to above 1, which could occur in even a relatively well-vaccinated population. We also need to factor in possible new, vaccine-resistant variants arising (which is not implausible).

Restrictions: I don't expect the government to return the restrictions. They have just lifted them on July 19, knowing the situation with the delta variant. The only reason to have restrictions is if hospitals are overwhelmed, and that is unlikely to happen given the high and increasing vaccination rates and the protection that vaccines provide against being seriously ill.\n2. Behavior changes to reduce contacts: there is no incentive for the population to do so, given the the high and increasing vaccination rates and the protection that vaccines provide against being seriously ill. With the restrictions lifted, the opposite is to be expected.\n3. Medicine: even if tomorrow there was a hypothetical new medication / vaccination that the whole population (including the children) could take that would prevent infections, it will take many months for everyone to take it (and again there won't be an incentive).\n4. Herd immunity / running out of new people to infect. Out of the 4, this is the trickiest to estimate.\nEven with the high vaccination rate, there will still be a significant % (e.g. children, but not only) who are not vaccinated. In addition, while vaccination protects against being seriously ill and fatalities, the protection against catching the disease is much lower.\nWill the UK get to herd immunity? Officially, 8.38% of the population has tested positive, but some studies claim that the actual numbers are 8-10 times higher. Even so, the protection that previously being sick provides is unclear, and estimated to be less than that of vaccinations.\nFalling below 15K cases / day out of a 66M population means 0.02% of the population being infected, which is not that much.\nSee also the modeling done here: https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-kingdom?view=infections-testing&tab=trend&test=infections"], [62808, "2021-07-23T10:53:34Z", [0.16, 0.37, 0.38, 0.09], ""], [94872, "2021-07-23T07:35:15Z", [0.18, 0.39, 0.35, 0.08], ""], [86554, "2021-07-23T06:35:09Z", [0.48, 0.48, 0.02, 0.02], ""], [86554, "2021-07-23T06:34:08Z", [0.6, 0.4, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [81262, "2021-07-23T06:24:20Z", [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.25], "Assuming any policy intervention only takes place after the summer"], [98226, "2021-07-23T05:57:56Z", [0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.4], ""], [101934, "2021-07-23T03:21:21Z", [0.35, 0.4, 0.2, 0.05], "It has taken about a month for cases to fall enough to get from where they are now to below 15,000.
