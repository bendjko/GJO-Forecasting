So let\u2019s try to model both:\n- Civilian Non-institutional Population (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CNP16OV):  Reasonably well defined linear function based on population growth.  I simply took the monthly change from April to May 2021 and extrapolated that value through the end of the year.  \n- US Civilian Labor Force (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CLF16OV):  This is much harder to model; however, the question threshold is well define. Based on the denominator for the remainder of the year, the current US civilian labor force figures, and a 63% threshold, between now and the end of the year, the US Civilian Labor Force would need to increase between 3.7 million and 4.1 million people to reach 63%.  It is currently 160,935 thousand (or 160.9 million people).  The net increase includes both additions to (i.e. school reopening and parents re-entering the work force) and detractions (i.e. retirements) to the labor force.  Importantly, the labor force participation rate includes those that are on unemployment.  With respect to additions to the civilian labor force, based on a NY times article from earlier this year, there are ~4 million people who left the labor force (https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/15/business/economy/labor-force-dropouts.html). At the same time, retirement have increased, which has caused people to voluntarily drop out of the labor force.  This appears to be a result of two factors, (1) strong equity markets and (2) challenging work environment.  For those financially able, why work from home (or go back to the office) when you can retire?  https://www.marketplace.org/2021/05/12/retirements-increased-during-the-pandemic-reversing-a-trend/ While it may be close by the end of the year, it seems challenging to envision 4 million people voluntarily come back to the labor force (note: I\u2019m not talking about coming off unemployment for an available job).  Inertia is very powerful, especially given the increased pandemic savings and additional child tax credits that will start going to families in July.  Further, additional retirements are likely when employers ask associates to come back to work.  With that said, once school starts again, labor force participation may quickly increase as people indicate they are seeking employment based on the survey.   As this forecast may come down to the report in December, I'm placing a higher probability with expectations to change the probability either direction starting in early October after the September jobs report is released.\n"], [20256, "2021-06-29T19:42:58Z", [0.06], ""], [13657, "2021-06-29T13:45:58Z", [0.01], ""], [100715, "2021-06-28T15:33:33Z", [0.89], "Remain bullish that as the summer comes to an end and with the number of unfilled job openings, we will see a surge in the participation rate around September.

Additionally, states which can hold back this rate overall such as NY and California - due to their large populations in major urban metros - appear to favor providing social assistance to residents who do not wish to return to work, which will further deter individuals from seeking employment in cases where benefits exceed minimum wage rates or salaries paid for their skill level or occupation (income levels which may potentially comprise a large swath of labor force in these areas).  I believe that this will be a domestic issue which could persist for some time, as there appears to be no expected population \"booms\" anticipated that will supplement the aging workforce which will be retiring over the next decade in the US; I would expect that a rational individual at some point will make it into a position of office who can convince others to finally accept that we will desperately need people immigrating here if we want to see our economy expand in the future. Michio Kaku  presented a good argument in a debate held between he and Peter Thiel were he outlines this issue as well as how reliant we are on H1-B visas for STEM related innovations; All that is to say that in the some odd scenarios I can imagine which could feasibly and arguably happen within the next year,  the one which could result in this labor participation rate to exceed 63% would appear to be one in which the domestic labor force participation rate grew in conjunction (appears likely) with a rapid economic recovery (appears likely) shift in sentiment towards pro-immigration policies (appears unlikely, albeit possible still, I suppose) so as to offset shrinkage in overall labor force participants thereby increasing the pool to a reasonable enough size that this participation rate would be attainable."], [32258, "2021-06-03T23:23:34Z", [0.02], "Recovery increasing slowly; don't believe it will leap to 63 before the end of year despite that half of US states will end federal bonus unemployment affecting 3.7 million people.

A major factor is inflation.  We are already seeing inflation ticking up as a result of over stimulation of state and federal cash transfers and spending.  As a result, there is a lot of pent up money out there without anything to purchase and supply restraints.  One of two things could happen.  That pent up money begins flooding the market, resulting in companies increasing hiring to meet demand resulting in more stimulation and inflation, but would probably increase the participation rate over 63%.  Or the federal government attempts to intervene to control inflation, which, depending one which mechanism they employ, could result in the participation rate either increasing or decreasing.  One possibility is the increase of federal cash transfers/benefits makes it more advantageous to not enter the workforce in the short term.  Additionally, the federal debt to GDP is over 133%.  Generally, anything over 80% is not considered financially stable, which historically has led to increased printing of money then inflation and if not controlled hyperinflation.  Currently such notable countries as Sudan (212%), Eretria (176%), Suriname (166%), Barbados (143%), Maldives (140%), Cape Verde (138%), and Belize (127%) top the list of countries with the highest debt to GPD rate.  Of note, also among the top ten are Japan (257%), Greece (210%), and Italy (157%), all of which have faced limited adverse economic impact, mainly slow growth, in comparation to the other countries on the top ten list.  Japan, for almost a decade now, has aggressively pursued an economic policy of high government spending in exchange for controlled, slow economic growth.  Italy is pursuing a similar policy.  So, what does all of this mean?  The federal government better have a plan in place that does not solely relay on economic growth or even an economic boom.  I am not not that confident in the ability of the federal government, which leads me to believe that it is more than likely a 63% or higher participation rate will be hit this year, but what comes next could be very messy.  Of note, the participate rate has never recovered from the Great Recession, but that is a discussion for another day."], [100664, "2021-06-02T11:56:05Z", [0.0], ""], [88452, "2021-06-02T06:10:08Z", [1.0], "The US civillian labor force participation rate is the mirror image of another BLS figure, \"Persons not in the labor force who want a job\" https://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/persons-not-in-the-labor-force-who-want-a-job.htm# which reflects the structural unemployment or, usually, people with a lack of certain standard educational attainment, people who lost their job permanently because of structural shifts in the economy (decarbonization of the energy sector, e.g. coal mining) or who do not clear the hurdles for entry into the first or second labor market for personal or other reasons (e.g. criminal records, PTSD as veterans,...)\nThe pandemic made the figure jump from 5.01mn to an unprecedented 9.92mn people between Feb and April 2020, but the economic recovery reduced it to 6.65mn over the following 12 months (-3.27mn people). However, the remainder in order to reach 63% labor force participation rate appears to be approx. 2.8mn more jobs/less \"persons not in the labor force who want a job\". \n This would mean a return to 3.85mn people with structural unemployment, a level not seen for the past 20 years. Between 2001 and 2007 (before the \"Great Recession\") the figure was stuck between 4.5mn and 5.2mn persons. In the wake of the Great Recession years, it hit about 7.0mn persons.\nUnder the 45 administration, it was reduced from 5.67mn to a local minimum of 4.76mn in October 2019. The question thus really is, whether job creation with low entry hurdles (unconventional jobs, job sharing in order to lower the excessive working hours per week in some sectors, temporary employment, part-time employment, repatriating of manufacturing jobs in order to substitute fror imports,...) and the decline in structural unemployment will continue, together with a prolonged economic boom, will continue at a pace similar to Apr-Aug 2020, once the pandemic is surmounted with the help of vaccinations and outbreak control. Female labor force participation could be increased by paid maternal leave or other means to reduce disadvantages of and double duties on women in the working age and increase accessibility to the first labor market. It will be hard to achieve, but the key to this figure will be education and increasing the number of e.g. \"green jobs\" that have a sustainable future and need education programs anyway. The economic stimulus the Biden administration is willing to invest into sectors and employers with a high potential is enormous, and the political targets and initiatives are chosen in the right direction. The issue may be to find the right balance of monetary incentives and education programs and focus on regional reasons for unemployment and those regions with a weak economic foundation and traditionally uncoupled from growth (which has usually happened on the US coasts) and left behind.\nThe sheer amount of money at the administration's disposal and the speed at which key problems in the society are adressed (including infrastructure, which typically offers a number of temporary jobs for unskilled labor) makes me confident it will happen. The hospitality industry is also desperately looking for employees, who obviously have a bad trade-off versus benefits due to a low wage. If this field is adressed and a viable third labor market is created,  2.8mn more jobs within the next 7 month could be realistic, as the seasonally adjusted Civilian labor force participation rate suggests\nhttps://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/civilian-labor-force-participation-rate.htm"], [79142, "2021-06-01T23:03:00Z", [0.2], "61.7 in April. keeping 0.2 increase monthly, will only get over 63 in Nov and Dec (63.3).
