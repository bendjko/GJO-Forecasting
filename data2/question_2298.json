Prices look poised to jump above 150 in March based on their prices thus far, and while there's a chance they'll decrease in April back below the threshold, it doesn't seem likely to me unless the March jump is lower than expected. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I approached this one by first getting a forecast for the FFPI by taking each of the 5 individual components and doing a linear regression on each according to their most recent trend. The result of that in my method was 141.8 in March and 143.8 in April, which isn't promising. The index historically doesn't tend to have dramatic swings between months either. But they obvious issue is that there have been dramatic changes in commodity prices that need to be accounted for. I ended up using two approaches to estimate the effect of those shocks as I mulled the question over. Firstly I attempted to reconstruct the FFPI using historic futures market data for some of the items that make up each component. For each component (wheat, palm oil, milk, etc.) I got prices for February and March multiplying volume x price for traded futures, seeing what the month-over-month percent change was, and applying those to the FFPI index categories. A breakdown of the proxies I used for each index component is below. The correlation between the dairy/cereals/oils components and the actual index is .83 for Apr'21-Feb'22 (using month-end price), which is decent enough for what I need. The predictions from that model are for the FFPI to jump to 157.4 in March, which is a pretty ridiculous jump. I added a second approach for a few reasons. Firstly, I was finally able to (I think) find out how the FFPI sources its data, and do a more informed prediction from there. Secondly, futures and FFPI indices track decently in normal times, but I'm not sure if that link holds up during shocks. For example, wheat futures recently jumped ~40%, while the IGC wheat index that the FPI uses jumped only ~23%. Thirdly, a jump of 17 points is a pretty outlandish result considering the history of the index, so I'd want to double-check that. Unfortunately for this approach though, the meat index doesn't have a listed source (and is hard to source in the other approach as well), and the oils data is behind a paywall, so I'm ignoring those for now. In the second approach, using March data so far, dairy should jump 5%, cereals 19%, and sugar 6%. The combination of those effects should be a 9.2 point bump in the index, up to 149.9. That's before factoring in the sizeable increases in vegetable oil prices, which were the second largest contributor to growth in the futures-based model, as well as any potential meat increases. So in both models we'll be solidly above 150 in March.  The question that that begs though is whether the price hikes will be durable, since we're forecasting April instead of March. I'm inclined to say yes for a number of reasons. Part of the overall increase is inflation, since this question is citing nominal instead of real numbers based on USD, and inflation has been accelerating for months and (at least for the EU) isn't expected to peak for another month or so. Prices across the board are also being driven higher partly by oil prices affecting freight costs and operational costs for farming equipment. That doesn't seem likely to go down soon (https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gas-prices-high-expensive-come-down-cbs-news-explains/), both because I'm not expecting a resolution in Ukraine and because it doesn't seem like OPEC is poised to substantially increase output (https://www.ft.com/content/648e0f28-3dd4-4132-af53-fb9490f6ac11). The OPEC meeting on the 31st will be important to watch. Vegetable oil prices will likely remain high since the price spike seems to be due to bad weather in South America and Indonesia/Malaysia (https://www.marketplace.org/2022/02/17/oil-prices-surge-vegetable-oil-that-is/), though they may decrease from their dramatically elevated March levels. Wheat prices will likely remain elevated due to the Ukraine conflict, and the price hikes there have been pretty stable throughout March, so I'm inclined to believe they'll stay high. Dairy prices seem to be driven by higher energy, as well as by labor costs since most exports come from the EU and Oceania.  The chance that prices will go down a bit after a dramatic jump is a very real possibility though, and one to take seriously, which keeps me from putting my confidence any higher. Prices spiking as people panic and then receding back down as demand shifts, oil production increases, supply chains adapt, etc. is not an unreasonable scenario. If the index jumps to only 150 or so in March then I'll seriously need to reevaluate this. But at least given what we know now, the index should jump substantially, with the increase most likely a lasting one.  Approach #1 breakdown:\nMeat (33%): use historic average, chickens are 38% of the index and don't have a futures market to reference. Prices have been stable for the past few months and there's minimal change since February in cattle and pork prices which make up 62% of the index, so assuming its flat is probably fine.

And the pandemic dislocations that had brought the index into the 130's are all still relevant. If the index climbed 5.3 points in Feb, I don't see how it won't climb substantially more in March. Increases could slow in April, but I don't see how all of this could be reversed enough to bring the index under 150 in April. The FFPI is calculated in a slightly complicated way, with each commodity weighted according to its share of exports in 2014-2016. For the sake of argument, let's suppose that each sub-index of the FFPI is weighted about 1/5. For Feb 22, this overestimates the index by 1.5. Let's suppose that the cereals index increases by 10% in March, which is probably an underestimate, and that the vegetable oils index increases by, say, 8%. If all else stayed constant, and subtracting off the excess 1.5, this would bring the index to a crude estimate of 146.8 for March. But milk and cheese are continuing their substantial climb, and meat and sugar also look likely to be higher in March. So I think the March FFPI value will likely be somewhere in the range of 147.0-150.5, and probably towards the higher end of that range. If April only climbs a little (or possibly stays flat, depending on the March value), the index will be over 150.0. It's useful to look at past movements and values of the FFPI. Some here note that reaching 150.0 in April would be highly anomalous. This is true. The FFPI hasn't reached 150 since it started being calculated in 1961 (normalized to 2014-2016 prices). The reason why I'm certain the FFPI will reach or exceed 150.0 is because current circumstances are extremely anomalous. On top of already high prices because of a multitude of effects of the pandemic, Russia invaded Ukraine, and this has had a gigantic and immediate effect on grain and oilseed/veg oil prices. Russia and Ukraine together account for 25% of global wheat exports, and Ukraine is a heavyweight in oilseed exports. Hence, I don't think it's useful to compare what's about to happen to recent times or recent specific events. I don't think a comparison to 2007-2008 is very useful, either, because that situation evolved over time and was not the result of a sudden shock, whereas we're experiencing a sudden shock now from the invasion of Ukraine. So, I don't think past movements of the index really apply here. We are in an unprecedented situation that can be expected to have profound consequences around the world if it is not resolved quickly, and I don't think it will be resolved quickly. https://tradingeconomics.com/commodities"], [96828, "2022-03-19T12:02:56Z", [0.27], "Nudge up to align with others as well as for anomalous times.

So, jump is rare, but not unheard of.   Looking at current situation, commodity prices have jumped following Putin's invasion of Ukraine, with particularly relevant impact on wheat  prices (Russia and Ukraine are responsible for 25% of global production of wheat) [1] . Wheat prices have jumped over 30% since Putin invaded [2]. A resolution to the Ukraine situation and a return to previous trade levels seems unlikely to happen in the next few weeks.  Oil price jump is likely to be reflected in commodity prices, too. Market volatility is likely to have affected other relevant commodities, although others may be less reliant on these two countries.
