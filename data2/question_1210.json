With such approach you would think that the more data you get, the better your prediction - let's say, 5-year vs 10-year data set. The main flaw in this is that in 2014 Russia annexed Crimea, ruble depreciated from 28-36 range to 58-70 now (roughly), going through extreme periods of volatility. After that ruble has been depreciating gradually because of piling sanctions (American and EU) and relatively stable oil prices. But there is no other Crimea for Putin to annex (unless you believe the hype around small Baltic states). And Putin switched from world issues to domestic as Russians started to believe that Russia is a great superpower, but are wondering - why economy is stagnating and their living standards are relatively low? So I do not foresee high volatility of the past. The usual suspects are: price of oil (ruble spiked recently due to America-Iran tensions and subsequent increase of oil price), the Fed policy (as with all developing countries, ruble appreciates when the Fed decreases the basic rate and vice versa) and sanctions (no easing of those, but more may be coming - though in this case it will be \"diminishing returns\"). And of course, economy (stagnating, but this is most probably already \"priced in\"). If US-Iran tensions flare up, we can see ruble significantly appreciating. My guess it is of quite low probability. Most probably, US will increase pressure with sanctions and the oil price will be increasing within limits.  The Fed is expected to lower the rate soon - just nobody exactly knows when.  So IMHO ruble will be appreciating - but may not enough to pierce 62 mark- 63 level was met because of Iran and may not be sustainable at the moment. I may reconsider that statement No sophisticated data analysis, sorry."], [1333, "2019-06-23T18:17:16Z", [0.05, 0.25, 0.45, 0.25, 0.0], ""], [691, "2019-06-23T11:40:32Z", [0.01, 0.19, 0.59, 0.2, 0.01], ""], [40154, "2019-06-23T09:21:41Z", [0.01, 0.1, 0.75, 0.13, 0.01], ""], [37893, "2019-06-23T09:02:18Z", [0.1, 0.25, 0.3, 0.3, 0.05], ""], [26551, "2019-06-22T22:10:17Z", [0.03, 0.28, 0.39, 0.25, 0.05], "Base forecast similar to @cafebedouin and @Emil but slightly different results (my model is much dirtier and quicker, for sure). 8% - 21% - 33% - 28% and 10% Main indicators seem to be stable: RTS index is close to 5-year max [1], inflation around 5% and expected to go slightly lower [2], consumer confidence in same levels as previous quarters [3], govemenr t running a surplus in 2018 [4] and central bank reduced the interest in 25 bps [5].\nSuggestion is that there will be no changes, on the RUB 62.00 to RUB 66.00.\nSpecial attention to Oil, as Russian economy is very dependant on exports. According to Vladimir Putin, Russia doesn't need oil prices too high, he is comfortable with $60 to $65 a barrel [6]. Chances that the price gets closer to $70 are high, so this shouldn't be a limitation.\nSo, only negative note is with GDP, as it only increased by 0.5 in Q1, but with oil price probably higher and money in the budget, it can be corrected easily. I go heavier to RUB 58.00 to RUB 62.00 and to RUB 66.00.\nOne question: why 23rd of August? I couldn't find anything about it, that could be relevant.
