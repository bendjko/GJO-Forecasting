Anyone can see this from the WHO Situation Reports (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/). Needless to say, I presume an abundance of caution on the part of the CDC and some level of political pressure. Furthermore, reducing the travel advisory would imply that China looks more like Japan, that is, has returned to some degree of normalcy. That does not seem likely in the near-term. We simply do not know enough to think that a return to normalcy would not trigger a fresh wave of nw cases. @Skildr points out that the SARS travel advisory lasted 96 days. In the link he shared (https://www.cdc.gov/about/history/sars/timeline.htm), the CDC says, \"CDC lifted the travel alert on Toronto because more than 30 days (or three SARS incubation periods) had elapsed since the date of onset of symptoms for the last reported case\", for its actions on May 20. For May 23: \"CDC reinstated travel alert for Toronto because on May 22, Canadian health officials reported a cluster of five new probable SARS cases.\" I think a downgrading will demand a month or so of no new cases. China could achieve that within the next 30 days, giving the DCD 30 days from then to monitor the situation, so 60 days to be sure. So, let's say the first or second week of April is a good time to think the CDC might downgrade or lift the travel notice. However, though COVID-19 has a lower mortality rate than SARS (or MERS), it is transmitted between humans much more efficiently. For that reason, localizing it is very difficult so the CDC will be weary of a fresh wave of infections from China. Of course, China has much fewer rates of new cases than the UK and Western Europe, etc and in real as opposed to official figures, it is likely to have way fewer cases than the US, but I don't think that affects how the CDC will look at China. It makes sense to wait even if your home team is playing badly.

Base rate: As part of its response to the 2003 SARS outbreak, the CDC issued issued a travel alert for all of mainland China on March 29 and removed it on July 3 [2] - meaning the alert lasted for a total of 96 days. The CDC only lifted the travel alert once \"more than 30 days (or three SARS incubation periods) had elapsed since the date of onset of symptoms for the last reported case\" [2]. COVID-19: According to the CDC, the incubation period for COVID-19 is estimated to be anywhere between 2 and 14 days [3]. Assuming the CDC uses the 14 day number to be on the safe side, that would mean that the CDC would want to wait at least 42 days (three incubation periods) from the date of the last reported case before lifting its travel warning. The virus is still circulating in China and, while the daily reported case numbers are dropping, the epidemic in China may yet rebound once movement restrictions within the country are eased [4]. Moreover, there is widespread concern that China is under reporting its numbers due to either limited testing capacity, political pressures to keep reported case counts low - or both. -Before March 1: 0% chance of happening, given that there are only 8 days left until March 1.\n-B/w March 1 and April 15: If the last reported case occurred today, the earliest possible date the CDC would lift the travel warning would be April 4 (42 days from now). However, the outbreak does not seem like it will end anytime soon - certainly not within the next eleven days, given the current number of cases being reported [5]. If the outbreak in China indeed lasts at least another eleven days, then that rules out a lowering of the travel notice before April 15. I will thus only assign a 1% probability to this bin.\n-B/w April 16 and May 31: This will depend on how the outbreak plays out over the next few weeks. Tentatively, I will assign it a 13% chance.\n-Not before June 1: 86% [1] https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/964319\n[2] https://www.cdc.gov/about/history/sars/timeline.htm\n[3] https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html\n[4] https://www.statnews.com/2020/02/21/coronavirus-picking-up-steam-outside-china/\n[5] My spreadsheet on COVID-19: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d0JKwNcQsGVEMSMiUg0dZshGg-fVjWb7un-CNOi-vXk/edit?usp=sharing"], [81125, "2020-02-22T18:31:17Z", [0.05, 0.15, 0.25, 0.55], ""], [691, "2020-02-22T14:19:39Z", [0.0, 0.09, 0.51, 0.4], ""], [50981, "2020-02-22T13:07:08Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [84934, "2020-02-22T09:21:34Z", [0.15, 0.25, 0.45, 0.15], ""], [81375, "2020-02-22T08:56:55Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.6, 0.4], ""], [78501, "2020-02-22T02:31:49Z", [0.0, 0.2, 0.7, 0.1], "The most likely condition is that the travel advisory will be narrowed to cover only part of China.

Base rate: As part of its response to the 2003 SARS outbreak, the CDC issued issued a travel alert for all of mainland China on March 29 and removed it on July 3 [2] - meaning the alert lasted for a total of 96 days. The CDC only lifted the travel alert once \"more than 30 days (or three SARS incubation periods) had elapsed since the date of onset of symptoms for the last reported case\" [2]. COVID-19: According to the CDC, the incubation period for COVID-19 is estimated to be anywhere between 2 and 14 days [3]. Assuming the CDC uses the 14 day number to be on the safe side, that would mean that the CDC would want to wait at least 42 days (three incubation periods) from the date of the last reported case before lifting its travel warning. The virus is still circulating and the epidemic shows no signs of abating as of yet - so the date of the last reported case will probably not come anytime soon. -Before March 1: 0% chance of happening, given that there are only 14 days left until March 1.\n-B/w March 1 and April 15: If the last reported case occurred today (extremely unlikely), the earliest possible date the CDC would lift the travel warning would be March 31 (44 days from now). However, the outbreak does not seem like it will end anytime soon - certainly not within the next two weeks, given the current number of cases being reported [4]. If the outbreak indeed lasts at least another two weeks, then that rules out a lowering of the travel notice before April 15. I will thus only assign a 2% probability to this bin.\n-B/w April 16 and May 31: This will depend on how the outbreak plays out over the next few weeks.
