Using the 1st July demonstrations by Hong Kongers as a y-o-y sentiment indicator, it is being observed that while the number of protesters is still lower than the numbers shown in 2003, the number of arrests has been relatively increasing. This indicates that the air is heating up between Hong Kongers and the main govt of China. While in 2003 there was a record number of almost 500k on July 1st, I could not find any records quoting any arrests.  In 2020, however, with \"tens of thousands\" showing up for the protests (keeping in mind COVID-19 pandemic restrictions as a background) there were over 370 arrests reported. I worked out a weighted average to extrapolate the turnout for 2020 using previous years, and I am assuming a figure of ~82,000 protestors. The ratio of arrests is therefore 0.45%, against the 0% of 2003 when the numbers where much bigger. And while the trend of arrests is going up, the sense of freedom is in decline (https://multimedia.scmp.com/infographics/news/hong-kong/article/3016815/hong-kong-protest-city/index.html). With some simple arithmetic extrapolations I am estimating that for this year's July 1st march, ~173k protestors will show up and ~840 will be arrested, indicating a heated confrontation. Using the same argument in my previous forecast, the trigger for the confrontation will be if and when Hong Kongers attack the PLA/PAP. If the numbers and reasoning above are right, there is a high probability that this will be the case on July 1st.  I therefore adjusted the weights of my 2 player graph as follows: 1. Protestors will definitely not step back if the PAP/PLA show confrontation\n2. Protestors have more pay-off to attack, with rising arrests and attempts to curb freedoms from mainland govt I therefore put a 71% on the Yes."], [100362, "2021-04-30T14:10:08Z", [0.5], "Comment deleted on Apr 30, 2021 02:10PM UTC"], [86367, "2021-04-30T06:09:55Z", [0.08], ""], [60753, "2021-04-29T14:38:48Z", [0.5], "The question can not logically be predicted because the definition of 'confrontation' is not provided.

So sending in mainland forces just would strengthen the critics of China's trading and economic practises as well as it's human rights abuses.
