With respect to (1), there is a high likelihood of the SCOTUS blocking part of the moratorium.

There are three criteria per the scotusblog source that are considered, \"If the circuit justice refers the request to the full court, the justices normally consider three factors when deciding whether to grant a stay and put the lower-court ruling on hold: whether they are likely to take up the case on the merits by granting a cert petition; whether, after granting a cert petition, there is a \u201cfair prospect\u201d that the justices will permanently overrule the lower court; and whether the lower court\u2019s ruling will cause permanent harm if it is allowed to remain in effect while the case proceeds through the normal appeals process. The court will grant a stay if at least five justices vote to do so.\" One out of the three seem to be met or close to being met: (A) there is a 'fair prospect' that the justices will overrule the lower court [see Justice Kavanaugh's comment].  It is unclear if a second criteria will be met, but the longer the eviction moratorium is in place, the more likely landlords will be permanently harmed.
