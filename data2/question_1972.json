The killings are seeing a slowdown this month so far: https://aappb.org/?p=14434 However, there are reports of planned continuation of protests: https://www.cp24.com/world/anti-coup-protesters-in-myanmar-slowly-turn-to-armed-rebellion-against-junta-1.5392788\n2. Burma/Myanmar has been accused of having a secret chemical weapons program since the 1980s, but use of such weapons hasn't been verified. https://thebulletin.org/2020/03/myanmar-should-finally-come-clean-about-its-chemical-weapons-past-with-us-help/\nWhite phosphorus, which is not considered a chemical weapon under the Chemical Weapons Convention, is a toxic chemical that was used on mine protesters in 2013. Reports of chemicals' use on protesters in 2016 have not been verified.\n3. Ethnic factions and other groups have been fighting the national government more or less since the country gained independence from Britain in 1948. Many of these conflicts could be described as civil wars. What's our base rate? If they've had a chemical weapon program since, say, 1980s, then we have one confirmed use in 40 years. We also have many years (70+) of political violence, civil wars, and protest suppression. But let\u2019s say chemical weapons have developed in the past decade to the point that they can be deployed easily by the military. Then we\u2019re looking at one instance in the past 10 years, or two if we count the allegations in 2016. That gives us a base rate of 10%-20%.  Using chemical weapons by the military would be an escalation. It is easier for the world to shrug off traditional forms of violence against protesters in a conflict-ridden foreign country. A country that uses CW is another matter. It would peak once again in the news cycle. There could be repercussions.  So what could make it worth for the military junta to use CW anyway?

The United States has high confidence in this assessment because infrastructure has remained at several buildings at the Tonbo site.  Burma has failed to declare four dual-use facilities: three urea fertilizer plants and a methanol production plant under the Burmese Ministry of Energy which probably have annual production capacities that meet declaration requirements. The United States is also concerned that Burma did not declare two other locations that may have been involved in Burma's military-run CW program. However, most of the original buildings associated with Burma's legacy research, production, weaponization, and storage of sulfur mustard munitions remain at the historic CWPF near Tonbo, which was Burma's primary CW research, production, weaponization, and storage center during the 1980s. The physical integrity of the buildings at Tonbo remain intact. Burma should certify that the infrastructure no longer houses any CW-related materials or equipment.\n[...]\nAlthough the civilian government has actively engaged in discussions and indicated its commitment to fulfill its CWC obligations, Burma\u2019s military has not admitted to its past CW program.  The United States has encouraged regional partners and allies to raise this issue with Burma, but their engagement has been similarly unfruitful.  Further, the United States has informed the OPCW Director-General on the U.S. assessment of the Burmese past CW program.\" The DoS assessment of the 2019 situation shows that for some reason (maybe its ties with China?) Burma/Myanmar has apparently been gaslighting the international community about their capacity to secretly weaponize chemicals. In their press briefing of 26 March 2021, the UN characterized the situation as follows:\n\"In a statement, the Secretary-General\u2019s Special Envoy on Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener, said she remains deeply disturbed by ongoing violence committed by the country\u2019s security forces.\nTomorrow, Armed Forces Day, marks Myanmar\u2019s liberation from foreign power.  The Special Envoy said that ensuring peace and defending the people should be the responsibility of any military, but in Myanmar, the Tatmadaw has turned against its own citizens.  Women, youth and children have been among those killed.\nThe Special Envoy calls for the release of all those detained, including President U Win Myint and State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.\nAs Myanmar\u2019s Thingyan New Year approaches in April, the Special Envoy appeals for basic rights and democratic norms to be upheld in the greater interest of the nation\u2019s prosperity under civilian rule.\nThe Special Envoy will continue to amplify the Secretary-General\u2019s call for a firm, unified international response, bilaterally and collectively towards the restoration of the democratically elected Government of Myanmar.  She also supports the Security Council\u2019s calls for a peaceful solution through constructive dialogue and practical reconciliation in the interests of the people of Myanmar.\nAlso on Myanmar, the World Health Organization (WHO) in the country strongly condemns attacks on health-care providers and sites since the military takeover on the 1st of February.\nWHO says that, between 1 February and 24 March, there have been 32 attacks on health-care facilities and staff, resulting in two deaths and six injuries.  Dozens of facilities and several ambulances have been affected in 12 states and regions.\nWHO says the continuing use of force against health-care workers, including the reported occupation by security forces in hospitals, is taking a devastating toll on Myanmar\u2019s health system.\nAs the WHO Director General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has said, the destruction of health facilities and attacks on health workers must stop.  Now more than ever, health workers, health supplies and health facilities must be supported, functioning and serving all people, he has stressed.\"\nhttps://www.un.org/press/en/2021/db210326.doc.htm A military junta that attacks health care providers likely does not ultimately fail to use chemical weapons they possess against their own population, like examples of the few non-signatory states of the CWC, such as Syria, show. Myanmar is not yet in an outright state of civil war, but it's sadly not far off the cliff, and September 2021 is still 6 months to go. Developments until, and incidents at, \"Myanmar\u2019s Thingyan New Year [that] approaches in April\" could point to a turning point with respect to more and worse violence, imho. At this point in time, use of chemical agents that work as weapons are more likely than not."], [691, "2021-03-28T16:58:19Z", [0.02], ""], [37157, "2021-03-28T15:07:19Z", [0.8], ""], [3209, "2021-03-28T15:03:30Z", [0.0], ""], [100024, "2021-03-28T13:51:23Z", [0.2], ""], [67403, "2021-03-28T12:52:37Z", [0.2], ""], [67403, "2021-03-28T12:52:15Z", [0.15], ""], [34815, "2021-03-28T12:04:43Z", [0.0], ""], [99780, "2021-03-28T11:44:12Z", [0.25], "Per other commenters, it seems likely that the military has possession of these weapons and also that they would use them if deemed \"necessary.\" The question is why they would feel the need to do so - I think we would need to see a considerable escalation of violence compared to the current state of the conflict."], [45594, "2021-03-28T10:52:38Z", [0.2], ""], [94872, "2021-03-28T05:11:51Z", [0.5], ""], [99993, "2021-03-28T01:29:33Z", [0.0], ""], [92079, "2021-03-27T21:49:27Z", [0.0], ""], [86554, "2021-03-27T21:48:57Z", [0.23], ""], [67034, "2021-03-27T20:39:56Z", [0.63], ""], [67034, "2021-03-27T20:32:58Z", [0.36], ""], [55251, "2021-03-27T16:18:43Z", [0.54], ""], [37236, "2021-03-27T14:22:10Z", [0.0], ""], [99467, "2021-03-27T14:15:30Z", [0.9], ""], [93350, "2021-03-27T11:14:17Z", [0.6], "The first point to note is the report that the military junta has issued warnings that protestors will be \u2018shot in the head\u2019 if demonstrators persist in well, demonstrating.\nThis warning was acknowledged by the MRTV news channel and stated that young people should learn the lesson from those who have killed by being shot in the head or the back, that suggests targeted killing.\nAt least 320 people have been killed since the army coup.\nTherefore, the armed forces have not been holding back in killing people. The second point is the question of Myanmar\u2019s access to chemical weapons. The US government has said to have been aware of chemical weapons program in Burma (Myanmar) since the 1980\u2019s. This has been denied or maybe a dormant program that did exist as was accused as recently as 2016 of using chemical or toxins on its domestic insurgents. There is no evidence of this, however, but the existence of chemical warfare agents or production facilities were not declared and reported as a non-compliance by the State department. So, there a willingness to kill its citizens and a denied potential access to chemical or toxic agents.\nThe use of toxic chemicals is dependent on the military\u2019s inability to contain the demonstrators and the resultant nervousness over a loss of power. International outrage does not appear to be factor and China could diminish any trade sanctions.\nWill the UN, UN Agency or any OECD accuse the authorities of such use?
