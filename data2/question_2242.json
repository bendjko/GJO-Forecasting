This is not just a matter of whether the Democratically controlled Senate will confirm Biden's nominee. The slim majority needs to remain intact until somewhere around early August to complete the confirmation. Although Luj\u00e1n is expected to recover and even if he had left the senate, he would have been replaced in time with another Democratic Senator, there are probably some Senators who, if they left, the governor of the state could conceivably slow walk the process of replacing them or replace them with someone who would not confirm Biden's nominee. I made a quick guess as to a potential list of Democratic Senators whose departure could be problematic (and please let me know if you think the list should be different). Here is the list: senators = {\n    'Mark Kelley':['M',57],\n    'Krysten Sinema':['F',45],\n    'Maggie Hassan':['M',63],\n    'Jeanne Shaheen':['F',75],\n    'Jon Ossoff':['M',34],\n    'Raphael Warnock':['M',52],\n    'Tim Kaine':['M',63],\n    'Mark Warner':['M',67],\n    'Jon Tester':['M',65],\n    'Sherrod Brown':['M',69],\n    'Joe Manchin':['M',74],\n    } As with my SCOTUS opening model [2], I used the mortality rates which I believe is reasonable, since even though I believe these Senators are less likely to die than others of the same age, they might need to leave for purposes of health or scandal, so it's reasonable for a ballpark estimate. I created a script [3] to estimate the probability that none of the Democratic Senators I listed will leave the Senate before the new SCOTUS confirmation and came up with about 93%.  Within that remaining 7%, how often is / are the leaving Senator(s) replaced with someone who would approve the nominee? How often would a few Republicans go along with the confirmation? If it happened early enough, would Breyer change his mind and not retire? I inclined to believe that enough Republicans would vote for Biden's nominee that it won't be an issue, but I'd be open to changing my mind. In the meantime, I'm going to move closer to the crowd forecast. @probahilliby  - I think you're not unreasonable to be at 1% for no. I'm at just under half a percent.\n@belikewater - What do you think? Are you going to revise down as well?

Since the probabilities are multiplied together to get the estimate, the order doesn't matter, but, logically, it is important to conceptualize that Breyer's planned retirement would reduce the chances of his unplanned vacancy and his unplanned vacancy would reduce the chances of his planned retirement, so this is accounted for. Furthermore, I apply a scalar to account for the time left until the expiration of the question where the probability of a vacancy gets lower and lower as the deadline approaches. That covers modeling the \"No\" probability. For the next iteration, I'll model the two buckets of the \"Yes\" probability, but for now I'll say that I think the chances are high that a replacement justice would be confirmed if there is an opening and sufficient time.\n[1] https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1386167\n[2] https://github.com/jonathanmann/gjopen/tree/master/scotus_opening"], [87974, "2022-01-26T00:53:40Z", [0.01, 0.22, 0.77], ""], [96828, "2022-01-25T23:49:36Z", [0.27, 0.08, 0.65], ""], [103878, "2022-01-25T22:56:44Z", [0.25, 0.1, 0.65], ""], [104055, "2022-01-25T21:32:03Z", [0.6, 0.1, 0.3], "Breyer is 83.

For the purposes of base rate I am considering all justices who 1) served at least one day on the Supreme Court between January 1990 and January 2021, 2) left the bench either by death or retirement, and 3) were/are greater than 80 years in age.  20 justices have served on the court during this period. Subtracting the 9 currently serving justices (including Breyer, since he is the subject of the question), there are 11 justices who left the bench. 8 justices retired and 3 justices died while on the bench.  Of the 8 who retired, two (2) of them were younger than 80 years old, meaning the number of justices who fit the three criteria above is 9 (6 retired, 3 died).  Since January 1990:\n3 of 9 died on the bench = 33%\n6 of 9 retired voluntarily = 66%\nI don't have access to Justice Breyer's health information and cannot assume he is at risk of death (any more than the rest of us) in the next year, so the base rate that he will vacate the seat by retirement is 66%.  Augmenting information: \nOf the 8 total justices who retired (referenced above - including the young ones), the average age of the 3 conservative retirees was 78, whereas the average age of the other 5 liberal retirees was 84.6, suggesting the conservative justices were apt to 'turn over the reigns young' while liberal justices were more keen to hang on for longer. Justice Ginsburg is a good example of a justice who could have retired much sooner in her career during a Democratic presidency - and given her health problems - but chose not to. This article highlights some of these considerations: \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/27/briefing/supreme-court-justices-breyer-retirement.html.  Justice Breyer has been a federal judge or Supreme Court justice for 41 years, and most certainly knows that even if he were to retire this summer with Biden in the oval office and a Democrat-controlled Senate that his replacement would not change the ideological leaning of the Court, which is currently slanted 6-3 toward the conservative ideology. He has also written a book arguing that the SCOTUS is - and should remain - an apolitical body. All of this points me toward  the notion that there are few incentives for him to retire this summer prior to the mid-term elections.  On the other hand, should Justice Breyer decide to retire and vacate the seat prior to the mid-term elections in 2022, I believe that even if the Senate flips to Republican control that the current Democrat-controlled Senate (which will not adjourn until the end of the current 117th Congress on January 3, 2023)  would push through any Biden nomination made this Summer as political retribution for Republican actions installing Justices Gorsuch and Coney Barrett to the court.  All this leads me to propose that despite the base rate of 66%, there is a high probability that Justice Breyer will NOT vacate the seat. If he does choose to vacate the seat there is as close to certainty as possible that the Senate WILL confirm his replacement prior to January 4, 2023. \n"], [104034, "2022-01-25T17:35:22Z", [0.29, 0.1, 0.61], "Updating to reflect that the question is whether \u201ca \u2026 seat\u201d will be vacated, not only Breyer\u2019s seat.

Additionally, thanks to the justice age information provided by @pei-w-lee [2], the approximate mortality of the justices can be calculate based on data from the social security administration [3]. Although the justices each seem in good health for their ages, given that each one may retire for other unplanned reasons as well, the combined probability seems like a reasonable estimate for unplanned replacement of at least one justice.

There is reason to think the true probability is lower (these are wealthy individuals with access to high quality health care). So let's say around 15%.  The other way a justice can create a vacancy is by retiring. It would be highly unlikely for any of the conservative justices to retire (only Thomas is old) and since Joe Biden is president they would be replaced by a liberal justice. Therefore, only Breyer, Sotomayor, or Kagan may retire. The final two are pretty young <70 so it's very unlikely. Breyer is more complicated. Given the fact that RBG recently was in a parallel situation, decided not to retire, and was then replaced by a conservative justice suggests it is likely he will retire. This is his best chance as after this upcoming election the Democrats could well lose control of the Senate. But, Joe Biden's presidency lasts three more years, so it's very possible he waits it out another year or two. Or it's possible he does the same thing as RBG. It's tough to forecast and Breyer hasn't given many signals. I'll say there is a 30% chance he'll retire this year.  This gives us a 45% chance of a vacancy and a 55% chance of no vacancy. If there is a vacancy, I'm confident Democrats would move as fast as possible to replace the justice because the Senate majority is quite likely not going to remain. If the vacancy occurs after the midterm elections that may make it tricky navigating, or they may just push through with a lame-duck Senate anyway.
