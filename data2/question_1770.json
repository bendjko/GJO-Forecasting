We analyzed rolling averages and observe that prices have been in the 35-45 bound since June (and closed at $39.77 on Friday). OPEC considerations:\nOil price is mainly driven by OPEC decisions regarding their production limits. Therefore, when predicting WTI price, it is crucial to analyze how OPEC might act in the future. For this time period, we know that OPEC will have 1 more monthly publication, on September 14. To understand the dynamics there, one needs to see how each member is doing on their production limits set by OPEC. Recent news suggest that most members are in line with the discussed production limits, however, Iraq appears to be having problems implementing the additional production cuts (7.7M barrels / day) agreed on in the last OPEC meeting (see https://blinks.bloomberg.com/news/stories/QG5B3SBP8R2B). However, one needs to not that the last 3 meetings had no strong bearing on the price of crude oil. Other macroeconomic factors:\nAsia:\nThere is a discussion about the weaker demand from Asia, especially from China, following reports that suggested what the market had anticipated all along -- Saudi Arabia will probably cut prices for October shipments by about a $1 per barrel.\nUS:\nPrivate-sector US job growth in August was the slowest since the recovery began in May (August nonfarm payrolls -- 1.37M versus Bloomberg compiled consensus for 1.35M).\nEurope:\nGermany reported new manufacturing orders increased in July at 2.8% compared with an almost 29% surge in June as a drop in the domestic market undermined the jump seen overseas, signaling a moderate recovery from the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. Construction activity fell in the eurozone, with the IHS Markit construction PMI declining to 47.8 in August versus 48.9 in July. Conclusion: There are no current catalysts expected until September 22, therefore we put the main part of our distribution into the historical values, however, we also accept that there is some negative sentiment in the market that might push price further down.
