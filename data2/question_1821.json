That said, in case I'm looking at the data incorrectly or missing something I'm coming down a bit on over 5%, though I still think it's more likely.

Even if amazon and other companies offered a \"shop-now-and-pay-in January\"-referred payment program, this will not fully compensate for the delays in the lawmaking process.\n/As mentioned before, the retailers did preparations for a \"non-traditional\" holiday retail sales-season. They actively encouraged shoppers to push ahead with their purchases already in October to stretch the season and avoid dangerous scenarios with respect to malls, small shops, and overcrowded inner cities and shopping miles.\nThe November 2020 figures may thus be artificially blown up, since the peak season will have shifted from, I'd guess, 10 December into late November. The total holiday spending in December would then fall short of usual expectations, since people (those who are reasonably smart) could stop shopping around today and self-quarantine, in order to be able to have their usual family gatherings around Christmas safely. However, a general notion of optimism and the good stock market returns of 2020 so far probably increase the total disposable income of a lucky few, which could have a major contribution to still-increasing (yoy), higher than expected December figures.\nI not sure which effect will outweigh others, all the more there are only 16 days left until this question closes.
