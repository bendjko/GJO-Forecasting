I think the biggest unknown is the response of the teams to layoffs. Some may be slow coming out.  Also there is no \u201chome court advantage\u201d this year. Rockets, Lakers, and Bucks are the oldest teams in NBA so this break and shorten season will be a huge advantage. Harden is notorious for logging an exorbitant amount of regular season minutes and gassing in the playoff (as a huge Rockets fan I am unfortunately confident my Rockets have very little chance at doing anything this year). I think the question basically comes down to can the Clippers win this year. They will probably have to go through Lakers then Bucks.  They have a few DTD injuries but nothing bad. Bucks are 2-0 vs Clippers and Lakers are 1-2. But the teams have changed and given the gap in time many H2H are irrelevant. Lakers have some DTD and only Avery Bradley is out. Smith is looking good. For the Bucks Eric Bledsoe and Pat Connaughton are resting and have the one seed locked.
