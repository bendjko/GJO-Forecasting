It seems unlikely that the cancel more than 10 games and have an NBA champion. Canceling ten or more games would basically imply either i) they forgo the regular season aspect of the restart or ii) they do not complete the championship.  It seems to me highly improbable this experiment will work and they'll end up canceling more than 10 games. This is due to the following factors i) Players are probably not going to respect the bubble and will go out when they can.\nii) Florida is a hot spot for cases right now and it seems unlikely to abate soon. Florida is at around 7,000 new cases a day and it took New York state about 1 month to get it under control when they were at that level. \niii) Basketball is a contact sport, if one player gets it lots of players will get it.  For those reason I'm gonna be a little more pessimistic than the crowd. I think the most likely outcome is that they cancel the regular season and just do the playoffs as they stand.
