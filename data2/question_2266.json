Even if inflationary pressure is going to push the price up, a month-month difference, particularly looking at the data sheet in the question description, can be very noisy. For that reason I'm going to use a statistical approach based on the data in the table: 2,015 on 24th Jan -> 2,031 on 14th Feb For the price to drop to or below 2015, a price reduction of -0.99% is required.

For month-on-month changes, the price has dropped 4 times, 3 of which were the most recent three month-month periods.

However with the knowledge that the mid-month showed an increase we can dig a bit deeper. Never in the set have we seen (Drop month-month | No drop fortnight-fortnight previous report), but we have seen (No drop month-month | No drop fortnight-fortnight previous report) 26 times. Obviously this is a small dataset and it's governed by complex mechanics but the price history suggests the outside view is strongly in favour of 'yes'. Although recent reporting dates have shown decreasing prices, the changes have been less volatile than what we saw in Q4 2021.

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to confirm that the EU exports steel plates, which is mildly concerning as SteelBenchmarker shows stops showing price data for European steel plates around 2013.  The decreasing price of HRB and CRC steel prices seem like they should also be a weak indicator that the steel plate price should begin to decrease as well. This logic is lacking, however, as I don't have a good reason for why this should be a lagging effect. A single sentence from [1] might be suggesting that steel plate might have been resistant to the change because of increasing oil prices. Since oil prices have climbed since January 22nd, this would be an indicator for prices to increase. But, I would have expected the increase in prices to affect the price of steel scrap (since transportation costs would presumably increase), but steel scrap decreased in Jan '22.
