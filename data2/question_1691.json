Here's mine: This is basically a coin flip given the short time frame.  The earnings report could be good or bad relative to expectations. Unless there are major negative surpises regarding outlook , I don't think the report will mean much.  Investors in this market have discounted all the bad news up till now, even including medium term expectations. They are looking years out. Otherwise, how explain how the market has held up so well?  I am slightly bullish on Chevron in this time frame now because the market seems to be turning over, with tech retracing but energy holding up. I believe oil will hold at $40 because that's where OPEC wants it. Chevron is well enough positioned in the Permian to do ok at $40.  There are also recent signs of commodity strength elsewhere, particularly in copper. Whether this is due to renewed China growth or inflation, oil will benefit. (Chevron benefits from inflation because all that oil in the ground increases in nominal value.)

First off, let me say that if I knew for certain, I'd have more money than I do now.\nSo 17% is my ground floor. Chevron has a large footprint and a lot of real estate. Though their market cap has plateaued in recent years, you better believe they have a finger on the pulse of the future and have no plans to go gentle into that good night. At $125, CVX was overpriced and due for a revision, but even pre-C19 it held. Now at $86, it is a steal. The established trading community sees the same writing on the wall as everyone else but who doesn't enjoy a cliffhanger? \nWith a P/E of 13.67 and handsome dividend of ~6%, CVX is still the darling of many a boomer nest egg.  Robinhood, Morningstar and Zacks consider CVX a modest \"buy\" - https://www.zacks.com/stock/research/CVX/stock-style-scores So what does that mean?\nLet's say we get the earnings report... ...and it is good: People shout \"hooray!\" and buy it up. They benefited from people driving more because they are flying less. They beat the 'rona slump. ...and it is bad: People shout \"oh no!\" and some sell off chunks of shares and the price dips... then the professionals see the dip, and knowing the basis of my previous paragraph buy the dip and enjoy a handsome discount. In both scenarios, I see a plausible rise in share price. Earnings come out 7/31, pre-market (a bold, promising move,) and they handily beat expectations. Almost no outlets I've seen have called CVX a \"sell.\"\nGrowth is expected, value has been maintained better than their rivals, downstream earnings are consistently strong albeit a smaller footprint. Inflation and shrinking demand pose reasonable risks. If I'm wrong and everything falls apart, then all bets are off.\nAm I confident they'll perform well? Yes. Would I bet the farm? No. Is it possible that this question will close on an arbitrary downswing due to bad news? Yes. Does it matter? No.\nThat said, you could take the exact opposite of everything I said in my rationale and it'd be almost equally plausible. @Balzac thank you for encouraging a deeper dive.
