The counter argument is the that there is stalemate in the run up to the elections, and stimulus does not come, however this is against both the interest of the republicans and the white house as a booming stock market is going to be more favourable for the incumbent.

Likewise unpaid rent leads to financial stress for property owners.  The government is not going to let 30-50 million of people go bankrupt, so deficit spending will be with us for quite a while. If the treasury spends money that it doesn't have it can just create money with a few strokes of a keyboard.  That increases the total assets on the Fed's balance sheet.  The other way to finance deficit spending is to borrow the money by selling bonds. Although interest rates are incredibly low, pension funds, insurance companies, and other investors are buying bonds like crazy.  [This cannot end well, IMHO. But I don't know how it will end, other than with years of financial repression.  Forget about earning interest on your savings for a decade or more.]   So a basic question, to which I do not know the answer, is whether the treasury will finance deficit spending through more money creation, or by selling bonds that yield essentially nothing to willing investors. If they sell too many bonds it could, at some point, spook the market and cause bond rates to rise.  They don't want that.  But they can always buy any bonds that the market does not want, and hold them on the Fed's balance sheet. The crowd is betting on lower numbers.  I'm going to bet that at some point before the end of the year, possibly during the much anticipated second wave of the virus, the bond market will start to choke on low-yielding  bonds.

When the economy doesn't bounce back sufficiently to restore fiscal stability to hard-hit states the choice will be between bankruptcy and helicopter money.   States cannot create their own money, but the Federal Reserve can.  Teachers, police, firefighters, and hospital workers would be impacted if cities and states declare bankruptcy.  Our choice will be between a bailout or a breakdown of civil society.  I believe we will simply print the money.
