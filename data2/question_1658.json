She said she is committed to reviving bipartisan talks on the self-driving bill next year, and she said she has received commitments from Democratic leaders that it will be a priority if the party retains control of the House. The measure would allow the Secretary of Transportation to grant exemptions to federal motor vehicle rules that require cars to have human operators. Initially, 25,000 cars per automaker could be operated if companies can prove they meet existing safety standards for traditional cars. After a 12-month period, the number of exemptions per manufacturer would increase to 50,000, and it would go up to 100,000 in the third and fourth years.
