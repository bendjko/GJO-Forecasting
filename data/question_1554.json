This verdict is based on past historical patterns, where sharp stock market decline precedes economic recessions. Trump's unilateral approach to a global problem is typical Trump, but we have people in Congress with more sensible policy approaches who will continue to ignore him and also sensible policy makers at the state and local level. \nAs the World Economic Forum typically leans toward more conservative estimates, the coronavirus crisis would further act as a big shock to the economy, due to unprecedented amounts of unemployment and other demand shocks. A severe pandemic can result in millions of deaths, and even the most conservative estimates suggest that pandemics destroy up to 1% of global GDP, which is comparable to other top-priority threats, such as climate change (World Bank). \nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said global growth could plummet to just 1.5 percent in 2020, far less than the 3 percent it projected before the virus surfaced. Additionally, central bankers have less room to loosen monetary policy today than they did heading into the 2007 recession. In the United States, the federal funds rate was above 5 percent back then and was ultimately lowered to near zero. \n\u201cGoldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley economists joined the rush on Wall Street to declare that the coronavirus has triggered a global recession, with the debate now focusing on its likely length and depth. A day after President Donald Trump conceded the U.S. slump alone is set to be \u201ca bad one,\u201d economists threw away their forecasts that the world could avoid tumbling into recession for the first time since the financial crisis.\u201d S&P Global added in a report expecting that growth would range 1% to 1.5%.\n\u201cThe hit to consumer spending and business investment, plus the oil price damage to energy infrastructure investment likely means a 1% contraction in first quarter and 6% contraction in the second, U.S. Chief Economist Beth Ann Bovino said in a note.\u201d https://www.ft.com/content/1056a4da-6acd-11ea-800d-da70cff6e4d3\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/business/economy/global-economy-coronavirus.html\nhttps://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/pandemics\nhttps://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO\nhttps://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/morgan-stanley-goldman-join-global-recession-chorus-200317192956125.html\nhttps://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/coronavirus-destroy-10-million-jobs-economists-fear-200320234124940.html\n"], [31275, "2020-03-22T18:21:35Z", [0.31, 0.46, 0.23, 0.0, 0.0], "Morgan Stanley says .09. https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/17/morgan-stanley-a-global-recession-in-2020-is-now-the-base-case.html\nOECD 1.5, Reuters survey of economists 1.6.\n"], [11788, "2020-03-22T18:19:33Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [30976, "2020-03-22T18:15:39Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [85517, "2020-03-22T18:11:06Z", [0.05, 0.2, 0.2, 0.35, 0.2], ""], [10445, "2020-03-22T17:17:13Z", [0.55, 0.35, 0.05, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [35838, "2020-03-22T16:25:50Z", [0.98, 0.02, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [31275, "2020-03-22T16:23:35Z", [0.3, 0.35, 0.35, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [82626, "2020-03-22T15:17:42Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [86173, "2020-03-22T15:07:28Z", [0.95, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [86532, "2020-03-22T13:47:20Z", [0.95, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [86532, "2020-03-22T13:44:04Z", [0.8, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [84554, "2020-03-22T13:24:12Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [57110, "2020-03-22T12:58:55Z", [0.9, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2020-03-22T12:36:41Z", [0.77, 0.23, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [74104, "2020-03-22T10:47:20Z", [0.95, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [86527, "2020-03-22T10:46:58Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "we have wiped out the gdp this year, we may see negative growth"], [86267, "2020-03-22T10:25:13Z", [0.56, 0.36, 0.05, 0.02, 0.01], ""], [79042, "2020-03-22T08:37:48Z", [0.8, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [23999, "2020-03-22T07:54:14Z", [0.98, 0.02, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [28875, "2020-03-22T06:42:10Z", [0.45, 0.35, 0.15, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [59042, "2020-03-22T04:24:59Z", [0.96, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01], ""], [15189, "2020-03-22T02:57:57Z", [0.6, 0.05, 0.35, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [12591, "2020-03-22T01:46:27Z", [0.98, 0.02, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [58979, "2020-03-22T00:22:32Z", [0.95, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [67635, "2020-03-21T23:23:12Z", [0.2, 0.4, 0.35, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [86520, "2020-03-21T22:59:22Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [64407, "2020-03-21T21:57:51Z", [0.95, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [81771, "2020-03-21T18:58:01Z", [0.5, 0.35, 0.15, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [85210, "2020-03-21T18:15:34Z", [0.39, 0.22, 0.18, 0.09, 0.12], ""], [85939, "2020-03-21T17:37:38Z", [0.53, 0.45, 0.02, 0.0, 0.0], "The WEO tends to be more conservative in their estimates, tending towards a status quo.

The coronavirus crisis would further act as a big shock to the economy, due to unprecedented amount of unemployment and other demand shocks.\n- OECD mentioned that even in its best case scenario with few cases outside China, it would cut its growth forecast by 0.5%. In worst case, it would consider cutting 1.5% -> bringing us to the 1.5% edge.

This could be a stabilising force. Multiple governments have also prepared stimulus packages.\n- Considering balance of supply shock and demand shock caused by Covid-19, I'm leaning towards the view that the world economy currently is too fragile to recover quickly even after the health crisis fades. https://www.moneyandbanking.com/commentary/2020/3/8/covid-19-what-can-monetary-policy-do-3"], [37742, "2020-03-21T17:30:46Z", [0.9, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [28153, "2020-03-21T16:50:57Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [85774, "2020-03-21T16:10:56Z", [0.98, 0.02, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [83759, "2020-03-21T16:07:08Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [61367, "2020-03-21T14:22:57Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [86501, "2020-03-21T14:11:10Z", [0.99, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [82333, "2020-03-21T13:49:54Z", [0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [23999, "2020-03-21T13:27:31Z", [0.95, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [78237, "2020-03-21T12:45:22Z", [0.9, 0.07, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01], ""], [80790, "2020-03-21T11:22:56Z", [0.75, 0.15, 0.05, 0.03, 0.02], "Things are mostly likely to be negative.

This assumes a base case containment and China having a end Q1 trough, but relative containment outside China. Also consider trade issues, small business disruption and capital market volatility.    A broader contagion scenario brings growth down to 1.4% So, China is troughing but March looks early. More like Q2.   But US has/is underperforming on its COVID response. Even is EU - maybe - is performing OK.  This means we are going to be closer to the broader contagion scenario, with down side risk.  The point estimate for that is 1.4%  or right in the 1.5 boundary.  I don't think the containment scenario is now correct, so only give it 5% weight, but it is possible. The US might mobilise.  The other two downside scenarios are both quite likely, but I'm pessimistic on US which is the major economy by some margin. That could change as time evolves. So most weight on the worse scenario, but close. https://www.oecd.org/economic-outlook/"], [74903, "2020-03-07T16:29:48Z", [0.5, 0.3, 0.1, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [20284, "2020-03-07T16:21:19Z", [0.15, 0.7, 0.15, 0.0, 0.0], "Lower than normal growth for the developing world but still about 4 - 6% will be offset by U.S. in the  1.5 -2% and with 0 to minus in the EU.
