A surprising *one* independent candidate has made it into the parliament for the Ashanti region, and there's a remote case she or he will become a tie-breaker. TOTALS (as of 10 December 2020) :\nNew Patriotic Party \t\t\t137 \t\nNational Democratic Congress \t\t\t135 \nIndependents \t\t\t1 It appears these results, like those of the presidential race, are preliminary only, since two seats are lacking.\nI assume they are not yet confirmed due to the Techiman South district results being contested. In case the NDC is assigned both of the seats, there will be a tie (137-137) with the NDC, with one additional independent candidate. I wonder what happens if the independent candidate joins one of the dominant fractions retroactively, and if this is possible at all.\nHard to say, who contested the outcome of the election in Techiman South district, and who will eventually receive one or two additional seats.\nPossible combinations:\n/NPP: 2; NDC: 0; others: none; independents: none\n/NPP: 1; NDC: 1; others: none; independents: none\n/NPP: 0; NDC: 2; others: none; independents: none\n/NPP: 1; NDC: 0; others: 1; independents: none\n/NPP: 1; NDC: 0; others: none; independents: 1\n/NPP: 0; NDC: 1; others: 1; independents: none\n/NPP: 0; NDC: 1; others: none; independents: 1\n/NPP: 0; NDC: 0; others: 2; independents: none\n/NPP: 0; NDC: 0; others: 1; independents: 1\n/NPP: 0; NDC: 0; others: 0; independents: 2\n/the remaining two seats cannot be determined in due course and remain open (?)\n(Did I miss one?) (i) In 5 out of 11 possible scenarios, the NPP will receive at least one seat to form a majority fraction, or will keep the existing majority of 273 current seats.\n(ii) There is exactly one scenario with a tie (NDC: 2)\n(iii) In all other scenarios, in which the NPP receives none of the seats outstanding, that will leave them with a plurality, not majority. It's very hard to find baseline probabilities, however, I'll try.\nMy guess is the NPP will be in a close lead for both of the seats in the range of 51%-52% of the votes. (i) 15% for each of the scenarios, plus 10% for the very last, undetermined outcome.\nIt would be interesting, whether this last scenario leads to a nil of the two seats, a nil of the districts election, or possibly even a nil of the 2020 Parliamentary Election as a whole. I assume, however, one can in any case exclude the fourth bin (\"Parliamentary elections in Ghana will not take place in 2020\"), since the elections actually *HAVE* already taken place.\n(ii) 10%\n(iii) due to my assumption as above (close lead for the NPP), and my previous assumptions of the partisanship of the Electoral Commission: all other scenarios, which lead to a \"plurality, not majority\" 4% each. However, this appears to be a real option and should not be neglected.

As the incumbent, he is likely to get re-elected, however, the contest in the 2016 election was so close (53.72% vs. 44.53%) that, according to an anecdote, \"[t]he election results were announced on 9 December 2016 due to a delay of voting in two areas. At 19:51 local time, Mahama called Akufo-Addo to concede defeat. At 20:45, the Electoral Commission declared that Akufo-Addo had defeated Mahama in a single round.\"\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Ghanaian_general_election Ghana obviously has a two-party system, where the other candidate was incumbent President John Mahama and got defeated in 2016, and is now going to tackle presidency once more. /Other candidates:\nIn 2016, \"[o]ver 16 people filed with the election commission to run for president. However, 13 presidential candidates were disqualified due to incorrect filing procedures. The disqualified candidates included former first lady Nana Konadu Agyeman Rawlings, the president of the National Democratic Party. There was some controversy due to allegations that the candidates were disqualified for political reasons.\" After some litigation, seven candidates in total were allowed to run, five of which totaled a combined percentage of votes of less than 2% and thus did not influence the neck and neck race between Mahama and Akufo-Addo by a wide margin.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Ghanaian_general_election#Presidential_candidates In this year's presidential election, the preliminary list of applicants contained 17 names, twelve candidates are obviously finally admitted according to a list, whereas five other candidates apparently have been excluded.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.orghttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Ghanaian_general_election#Final_list_of_Presidential_candidates All parties from 2016  have a presidential candidate running again, however, the following parties and candidates are new to the race in 2020 and their performance - alone and/or in total -  could be the feather that breaks the balance over the question, whether Akufo-Addo can again collect a majority in the presidential race.\nGhana Union Movement \tGUM \tChristian Kwabena Andrews\nGhana Freedom Party \tGFP \tAkua Donkor\nGreat Consolidated Popular Party \tGCPP \tHenry Herbert Lartey\nAll People's Congress \tAPC \tHassan Ayariga\nLiberal Party of Ghana \tLPG \tPercival Kofi Akpaloo\nAdditionally, the only independent candidate is Alfred Kwame Asiedu Walker (2016: Jacob Osei Yeboah), and the candidates of Progressive People's Party (PPP) and People's National Convention (PNC) have altered. With regards to the parliamentary elections, as part of the 2020 General Elections and which take place simultaneously, the majority for Akufo-Addo's NPP has been even slimmer in 2016, so there is some kind of a political \"halo-effect\" of the president's person. The NPP with candidates for all 275 seat won only 52.48%. However, the NPP won 169 seats, which means it must have won most of its seat with a very narrow margin, and lost the rest to the NDC by a wide margin.\nA different explanation is offered by the regional/district key of parliamentary seats, which has been established after the 2018 Ghanaian new regions referendum:\nThe NPP has its traditional strongholds in the presidential election in Ashanti and Greater Accra, the most populous regions, and thus won the most important constituencies, which brought along 44 vs. 3 seats and 21 vs. 13 seats respectively. Other strongholds for parliamentary seats for the NPP are Central (19 vs. 4), Eastern (28 vs. 5) and the newly established Western (13 vs. 4) and Bono (11 vs. 1).\nIn contrast, the 2016 strongholds of Mahamas's as a presidential candidate, Volta (subsequently split in two, Volta and Oti) carry 18 vs. zero and 7 vs. 1 seats only; Northern (subsequently split into Northern, North East and Savannah) 9 vs. 9 seats, 3 vs. 3 and 6 vs. 1 seats respectively for Muhama's NDC, probably as the constituencies there are less populous.\nAll other parties received *zero* parliamentary seats in total.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Ghanaian_general_election#By_region\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Ghanaian_new_regions_referendum\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Ghana#Composition_of_Parliament_after_the_2018_Ghanaian_new_regions_referendum As a conclusion, however close the presidential race will be and whatever effect the additional parties and candidates there may have on the percentage of votes for the NPP's candidate Akufo-Addo (he may end up just below 50% or majority) the new arrangement of electoral districts after 2018 indicates, that the NPP only has to be at least at the same outcome as in the 2016 elections in their own strongholds and not too much worse in the NDC's strongholds to keep their majority in the 2020 elections. All other electoral districts play a minor role and are not critical for the balance of power, as they are less populous and thus are assigned fewer seats. Keeping Ashanti and expanding seats in  Greater Accra will be half the way to a NPP majority. /Different methods of voter suppression, disenfranchisement skew the election results towards the larger parties in general and towards the NPP in particular:\n[i] The \"single-member constituencies using first-past-the-post voting\" favor the candidates of either the NPP or the NDC (which are the only parties to have candidates for all 275 constituencies), candidates of all other smaller parties have virtually no chance of winning one of the seats.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Ghanaian_general_election#Electoral_system\n[ii] As the numerous lawsuits ahead of both 2016 and 2020 candidate filings show, the Electoral Commission appears to be not completely impartial: if 13 candidates have been disqualified for the presidential election in 2016 alone, it is highly likely that either the filing process is very complicated or larded with additional hurdles, or candidates with less resources, party background or independents who could endanger the established two-party system are kept from being eligible intentionally, even for the parliamentary election.\n[iii]The 2018 Ghanaian new regions referendum, which happened under the NPP government is likely to further skew the assignment of seats in the parliament in the NPP's favor as it was an opportunity to crop and tailor electoral districts along demographic and ethnic edges. Three factors could have played a role in the decision for this referendum: [a] African countries tend to have a high share of under-age non voters, which I suppose tend to live in rural areas predominantly. As they bring no advantage in election terms, they are likely excluded from the governing party's districts. [b] urbanization and interior migration of labor force towards larger cities (the capital Accra in this case) renders it likely that the these metropolitan areas are now represented more than proportionately. [c] population growth in total (latest census figures date back to 2010) is likely inhomogeneous regionally, which would mean a shift of the electoral over time.\nI assume that the NPP will have designed the new districts with respect to all these factors, so that the party will not be worse-off in 2020 than in 2016 with regards to parliamentary seats. All of this suggests that the NPP will win a number of seats in the range of 160 to 175, which would again mean a majority."], [28899, "2020-11-19T14:50:39Z", [0.87, 0.02, 0.1, 0.01], ""], [1333, "2020-11-18T13:54:11Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2020-11-17T13:05:24Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [62808, "2020-11-15T20:33:40Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2020-11-13T06:32:45Z", [0.99, 0.0, 0.01, 0.0], ""], [86796, "2020-11-11T20:47:35Z", [0.94, 0.0, 0.05, 0.01], ""], [60948, "2020-11-11T09:44:35Z", [0.87, 0.02, 0.1, 0.01], ""], [1333, "2020-11-08T13:58:33Z", [0.99, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01], ""], [60948, "2020-11-04T08:44:33Z", [0.85, 0.02, 0.12, 0.01], "ModernGhana Election 2020 Poll: Akufo-Addo Scores 55.75%, Mahama Pulls 36.37% - Modern Ghana\nhttps://www.modernghana.com/news/1039823/modernghana-election-2020-poll-akufo-addo-scores.html\nMon, 02 Nov 2020 12:13:00 GMT Ghana: EC Not Following Legal Provisions to Ensure Credible, Transparent Election - Ex-President Mahama - AllAfrica.com\nhttps://allafrica.com/stories/202011030653.html\nTue, 03 Nov 2020 11:11:09 GMT"], [88452, "2020-11-04T08:34:49Z", [0.75, 0.0, 0.25, 0.0], ""], [87628, "2020-11-04T08:17:54Z", [0.95, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [60948, "2020-11-01T15:17:17Z", [0.82, 0.02, 0.15, 0.01], ""], [691, "2020-10-31T14:27:01Z", [0.97, 0.03, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [87854, "2020-10-30T08:19:40Z", [0.75, 0.01, 0.24, 0.0], ""], [60948, "2020-10-29T21:05:41Z", [0.8, 0.02, 0.17, 0.01], "There's no similarity between 2020 elections of US and Ghana \u2013 Oppong Nkrumah - GhanaWeb\nhttps://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/There-s-no-similarity-between-2020-elections-of-US-and-Ghana-Oppong-Nkrumah-1095748\nThu, 29 Oct 2020 08:24:42 GMT  \u201cWhile Mr Biden was not rejected at the polls by voters in 2016, Mr Mahama was massively rejected by Ghanaian voters.\u201d \u201cWhile Mr Biden\u2019s running mate Senator Harris is an accomplished senator who has added a spark to his candidature, same cannot be said of the NDC.\u201d \u201cThere is no similarity between the elections in the US and elections in Ghana.
