The resolution requires Secretary-General Gutteres to report back to the council on whether fighting continued or a political agreement was reached during the aforementioned period. In the absence of a political agreement, the UNSC members will \"consider\" taking one of the following measures (or both): 1) Travel bans and asset freezes targeting 6 high-ranking South Sudanese belligerents 2) An arms embargo, the target and scope of which remains unspecified.  The US-sponsored resolution was said to be watered-down and passed 9-0, with six abstentions. Bolivia, China, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Kazakhstan, and Russia were the abstainers.  In clarifying the rationale for the Russian abstention, Russia's UN ambassador came out strongly against possible sanctions and an arms embargo, calling them \"wrong-headed\" and doubting their effectiveness in bringing an end to the conflict. He went so far as to attack the US delegation for their \"damaging and disrespectful position.\" China also expressed doubt as to the usefulness of sanctions in ending the conflict, noting that they \"would instead further complicate the situation.\" The Chinese did not mention the possibility of an arms embargo.  So, despite Russia and China's non-objection to including the phrase \"will consider...an arms embargo\" in the resolution, it's clear from their statements that they are unlikely to acquiesce to a future resolution that attempts to impose a full-blown arms embargo. Add to this the amount of watering-down and wrangling that went into just producing this very lukewarm, non-committal resolution, and an arms embargo seems even less likely to pass. The main factor that could increase this assessment would be the occurrence of a major, media-attention-grabbing escalation of fighting on the ground. https://undocs.org/S/RES/2418(2018)  https://www.un.org/press/en/2018/sc13361.doc.htm https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/06/threatens-arms-embargo-south-sudan-180601054215777.html"], [46339, "2018-06-01T18:45:14Z", [0.0], ""], [172, "2018-06-01T02:25:08Z", [0.03], ""], [12302, "2018-05-31T20:02:05Z", [0.38], "-"], [691, "2018-05-31T18:42:31Z", [0.0], ""], [58678, "2018-05-30T15:40:51Z", [0.05], ""], [1333, "2018-05-29T16:17:14Z", [0.25], ""], [12302, "2018-05-29T14:50:50Z", [0.2], "Seems like my high forecast was misplaced....

I've yet to find comments concerning Russia, China, and Venezuela votes against.  If you do, would you post the source? Traditionally, arms embargoes work best against state agents, such as a nation's army.  Once fighting is being funded at the grass-roots level, the supply lines often include black-market, over-boarder infiltration, and more. Tribal wars are some of the toughest to control, let alone to end.  Ethnic conflicts are at the most difficult end of that spectrum. Having said that, The Security Council warned (source: AP)  Thursday of \"costs or consequences\" for South Sudan's government and opposition if they undermine upcoming\" efforts to generate peace.

African nations do not often vote to impose such measures on one another, and there is no evidence that Senegal would buck this trend. With all of this in mind, I would start at a 12% chance that both Japan and Senegal change their votes to yes [P(Japan) * P(Senegal)]. This gives the initial rate for 2017. Two other important considerations:  1) Vetoes: It is unlikely, but Russia or China could veto the measure if the US does get the votes. Call it a 10% risk (given that the US get the votes) and lower the overall rate to 11% [12% - (12% x 10%)] 2) The deadline for this question is 1 October 2018, which means that five new members (plus The Netherlands who is taking the second half of Italy's term via a term-splitting agreement) will be elected to the council on 2 June and take their seats on 1 January 2018 (http://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/unsc_elections_2017.pdf). Egypt and Senegal will be replaced by C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Equatorial Guinea, Japan by Kuwait, Ukraine by Poland, and Uruguay by Peru. If these countries are presented with a resolution, Kuwait is in a very similar situation as Japan was, likely to be wary about its peacekeepers on the ground and the effect of sanctions on a country they have been historically invested in. At the same time, their positive relationship with the US is probably more valuable, and it's likely Haley can convince them (80%). Neither C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire or Equatorial Guinea are much more likely to vote yes than Egypt or Senegal, especially given the bilateral partnership Equatorial Guinea just signed with S. Sudan and Ivory Coast's recent experience with a UN mission and sanctions within its own borders. The more likely of the two is probably Ivory Coast. Peru, Netherlands, and Poland can all generally be expected to vote in line with the countries that they are succeeding.

Currently the US are promoting an arms embargo but could not yet get the necessary majority, with eight abstentions in a December vote (http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-4444798/US-pushes-UN-consider-arms-embargo-South-Sudan.html). It appears that resistance was posed by Russia, China, Japan and Egypt, and though I can immagine the Russian and Chinese interest, and possibly those of Egypt, I do not see why Japan should not favor an embargo.  The timeframe to October should be sufficiently large even for a slow moving giant like the UN to come to a resolution.\nOverall I thus believe there is good reason but no certainty. A 60% thus would be a good guess.\nHowever, I do would like to be in the top of the scoring for a question at least once!
