By formally \"requesting consultations\" with the three countries, the first step in a trade dispute, Qatar triggered a 60-day deadline for them to settle the complaint or face litigation at the WTO and potential retaliatory trade sanctions. \"We've given sufficient time to hear the legal explanations on how these measures are in compliance with their commitments, to no satisfactory result,\" al-Thani said. \"We have always called for dialogue, for negotiations, and this is part of our strategy to talk to the members concerned and to gain more information on these measures, the legality of these measures, and to find a solution to resolve the dispute.\" The boycotting states cut ties with Qatar - a major global gas supplier and host to the biggest U.S. military base in the Middle East - on June 5, accusing it of financing militant groups in Syria, and allying with Iran, their regional foe, allegations Doha denies. The boycotting countries have previously told the WTO that they would cite national security to justify their actions against Qatar, using a controversial and almost unprecedented exemption allowed under the WTO rules.

In his first speech since four Arab countries severed ties with Doha, a defiant Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani said life was continuing as normal despite what he described as an unjust \"siege\". Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut ties and imposed sanctions on Qatar last month, accusing it of financing extremist groups and supporting terrorism, which the emir denied. \"Qatar is fighting terrorism relentlessly and without compromise, and the international community recognises this,\" Sheikh Tamim said in the televised speech. He spoke hours after U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the United States was satisfied with Qatar's efforts to implement an agreement aimed at combating terror financing, and urged the four states to lift their \"land blockade\". It also comes days before Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who had supported Qatar in the crisis, was due to visit Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to try to resolve the rift. Earlier this month during a round of shuttle diplomacy, Tillerson signed a deal with Qatar to fight terrorism financing, part of efforts led by Kuwait to try to resolve the most serious rift in the Western-allied Gulf in decades. An official comment from the four Arab countries had yet to be issued, but a Saudi royal court advisor described it as a piece of literary work written by a school student. \"Had it been written by a student in middle school he would have flunked,\" Saud al-Qahtani wrote on his Twitter account (para. 1-8).

Wang Yi made the remarks after meeting with his Qatari counterpart in Beijing on Thursday, a day after he held talks with a top official from the United Arab Emirates, one of the nations at odds with Doha.\nThe UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic ties with Qatar on 5 June, accusing the country of ties with Iran and of funding Islamist extremist groups. Dohadenies the claims. \"All sides should continue restraint and conduct face-to-face talks as soon as possible, so as to avoid escalation of the situation, send out a positive signal in addressing the crisis through political and diplomatic means, and reassure the role of the GCC,\" Wang was quoted as saying by Xinhua news agency (para. 1-4).

This could become more realistic if the other three member states begin echoing that sentiment. But with tensions probably greatest between Qatar and UAE, it shouldn't come as a surprise this language is being used. The GCC has an estimated $1.6 trillion GDP (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Cooperation_Council). And with some speculation indicating that a break up of the GCC wouldn't be as economically painful as it would seem at first blush, this is a possibility. However, if the U.S. and Kuwait continue to try to mediate the problem, it doesn't seem worthwhile to take a drastic measure such as ejecting a member yet. I'll need to see more evidence and commitment by all four countries before considering this more than fiery rhetoric from UAE."]], "open_date": "2017-07-18T17:00:10Z", "close_date": "2018-01-01T07:59:10Z"}
