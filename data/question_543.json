he'd pardon Zefzafi (or quietly cause the charges against him to be dropped).   We all know how hard it is to forgive those who do not acknowledge their error and who show no intention of changing.  Zefzafi appears to be one such person.  Zefzafi is being very mouthy and disruptive in court.  His behavior has caused his case to be postponed several times.  He shows no meekness, no humbleness, no fear of the system, no regret.

The judge referred the cases of Hirak movement activists to the Casablanca criminal court, their lawyer Mohamed Aghnaj said, Lakome reported on its Facebook page on 24 August. Aghnaj told Lakome that 31 of the activists, including the leader of the Hirak movement Nasser Zefzafi, are held in pre-trial detention in Okasha prison in Casablanca and one activist is free. Some of the detainees face \"serious\" charges, including conspiracy, and will be prosecuted in accordance with chapter 201 of Morocco's criminal code, he added. The Public Prosecutor in Casablanca Hassan Matar had called for Zefzafi and his companions to be tried in accordance with a clause in the penal code that carries the death sentence. The clause applies to anyone who carries out an attack with the aim of either provoking civil war or causing vandalism or looting. Zefzafi was arrested on 29 May.

French exports to Morocco increased by nearly 20% in 2016, with a strong increase in agricultural and transport equipment. Moroccan exports to France are concentrated on textile products, electrical and electronic components and agri-food products.\nFrance maintains its rank of first foreign investor in Morocco. France achieved in 2015 17% (484 M EUR) of the total net flow of FDI received by the Kingdom, largely concentrated in the industry. With about 750 subsidiaries of French companies listed, Morocco is the first destination of French investments on the African continent. It should be noted that 34 of the 40 CAC 40 companies are present in Morocco.\nCultural, Scientific and Technical Cooperation\nOur cooperation is in line with the priorities defined by the Inter-ministerial Committee for International Cooperation and Development (CICID) and the guidelines established at the high-level meetings between Heads of Government. A Partnership Agreement for Cultural Cooperation and Development was signed on 25 July 2003 between the Prime Ministers and entered into force in March 2010.\nIn the field of education, the thirty-nine French institutions in Morocco (including twenty-three institutions of the Agency for French Teaching Abroad) receive 35,500 pupils, 65% of them Moroccans. The French Institute of Morocco has twelve sites (Agadir, Casablanca, Fez, Marrakech, Meknes, Oujda, Rabat, Kenitra, Tangier, Tetouan, El Jadida, Essaouira), Alliance Fran\u00e7aise the Rabat IF, thus ensuring an active and notable presence in the country. The 34,000 Moroccan students constitute the first contingent of foreign students in France.\nThe State visit of April 2013 paved the way for new partnership agreements between French and Moroccan higher education institutions. The most emblematic project is the creation in Fez of a Euro-Mediterranean INSA, backed by the Euro-Mediterranean University of Fez (UEMF), labeled \"Union for the Mediterranean\". Other projects include a School of Architecture at the International University of Rabat with the School of Architecture of Nancy, PRES-Paris East, which hosted its first promotion in October 2013, a Central School in Casablanca, Mediterranean Institute of Logistics and Transport in Tangier in partnership with the University of Valenciennes and the Ecole Nationale des Ponts et Chauss\u00e9es, an international IUT, a faculty of medicine within the University of Agadir,\nThe French language enjoys the status of a true second language in Morocco. Our support for the teaching of French, which favors the training of trainers and the opening of international chapters, aims to consolidate this position.\nThe AFD group has been active in Morocco since 1992. The French Development Agency works through its Proparco subsidiary, dedicated to private sector financing, the Marseille-based Center for Financial, Economic and Banking Studies (CEFEB), the French Fund for the Global Environment Facility (FFEM), for which AFD provides the secretariat. Morocco is the first beneficiary of the French Development Agency's assistance with an exhibition of 2.5 billion euros. AFD focuses mainly on the water, environment and socio-economic infrastructure sectors. It also seeks to support the private sector, in particular by helping to modernize small and medium-sized enterprises.\"Updated: 03.05.17 at http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/dossiers-pays/maroc/la-france-et-le-maroc/ ..... she has emerged as one of the faces of the protest movement, singing about the death of Mouhcine Fikri, the fisherman who lost his life. Al Jazeera spoke with Ziani, who left her life as a college student to participate in the movement's activities full-time, about the prospects for the future of Morocco. Al Jazeera: What made you join the protest movement?Salima Ziani: When Mouhcine Fikri died, I felt a strong need to express my sadness. I demonstrated to speak up for myself. That horrible way in which he died allowed us to all speak up, to express our wounds. My heart was bleeding over how he was crushed in a garbage compactor. Fikri allowed us to come together as people of the Rif. We were already oppressed, but his death was our last straw. I always sang about social justice, about victims of oppression, but we were deeply saddened that the son of our land was killed in that manner. Everyone was crying - men and women were crying - as we realised that a human life had no value. But with al-Hirak al-Shaabi, we became like a big family. That is when people started knowing me; I also came up with slogans and expressed myself as a citizen. People started to know me quickly because of the strength of my voice. I wanted to show that women also were involved. I decided to stop studying and to join my brothers, who were protesting to the point that my family started missing me. I never felt that I was doing something wrong. I was just asking for justice as what is best for the country. Al Jazeera: How do you feel about the way the government has handled the protests?Ziani: We are all very peaceful. What they don't understand is that the reason we took to the street is because we love our nation, not just the Rif. We are indeed oppressed, we are indeed lacking a lot of infrastructure. I was protesting with good intentions. I never thought I would get arrested. The Moroccan constitution guarantees freedom of speech. What did I say to deserve being detained? It is our right to speak up. Al Jazeera: Can you tell us how you were detained?Ziani: I was arrested in June, a week after Nasser Zefzafi, the movement's leader, was detained. I was with two of my friends in a taxi when two cars were blocking the road. Men in plain-clothes appeared from the vehicles and took me with them. They didn't say they were with the police and they used bad language. When I saw the police station, I was relieved to find out that it was, in fact, the police. The way they treated me was harsh and I decided to accept it. I did not talk and did not answer back. They were so angry with me, I felt like I was in the hands of an enemy. They put me in a truck and took me to Casablanca. The drive was overnight and lasted about 13 hours. Meanwhile, my family was looking for me. They were told that I wasn't in police custody. Finally, in Casablanca, they put my dad on the phone. It was the first time I ever heard him crying. He told me, \"You are a hero, stop crying.\" I spent the first night in solitary. I had a very bad reaction, so they moved me to a cell with three other inmates. During those two months, I would sometimes sing alone. If it weren't for my lawyers' visits, I would have gone crazy. IN PICTURES: Social unrest boils over in Morocco's al-Hoceima Al Jazeera: How did you feel when you were released?Ziani: I discovered many things in prison. It was one of the best experiences and one of the hardest at the same time. Before my release, the prison warden asked me to sing for the other prisoners, so I sang all kinds of musical genres. That night, I was told that I was going to be released, and in the morning, I realised that I was being released alone, without my [fellow detainees] who were still in prison.  Al Jazeera: Is al-Hirak al-Shaabi over? If not, are you still going to be a part of it?Ziani: No, it's not over, and it's because we love our country - we're going to fight for our nation. If something hurts us, we will speak up. Right now, I am healing my wounds. My brothers tell me that I made sacrifices that even men didn't make. I was abused and my message was heard. It is time for me to take some time off [from being on the front lines of the protest movement]. We demand that they release all prisoners, because ultimately, they didn't do anything wrong. It is for the interest of the region and the nation to release them. These people took to the streets not because they had nothing better to do; we protested because we are oppressed and we want to live in dignity. As citizens, we lost faith in political parties. The king inaugurates projects and nothing else happens. Many of the protesters have degrees and no jobs. Everyone lives from fishmongering here - that's all we have. During our months of protesting, we used flowers, candles, and created human chains to protect the police station, to protect the police. We are not separatists. Rif residents are peaceful people who love the king. Right now, my healing process is under way. I stopped the anti-depressants and sleeping pills that I was given in prison. I am not sleeping more than a couple of hours a night. I participated to help create something beautiful that will benefit the nation. I was very strong, but now I am tired. But in my heart, I remain very strong.

Moroccan officials could address those needs better, he said,\nrather than resorting to repressive tactics.\nMorocco\u2019s Stability Is Roiled by Monthslong \n\u201cThe Moroccan regime\u2019s response has been disproportionate,\u201d he said.\n\u201cClamping down on peaceful protesters, imprisoning young bloggers and\nartists, will only harden Riffian nationalism.\u201d\nThe Moroccan Interior Ministry declined to comment about the accusations\nof torture and repression of peaceful protesters, and the government\u2019s\nspokesman did not return requests for comment.\nDuring his speech in July, King Mohammed blamed political parties for the\nRif unrest, but he did not offer specific solutions to the grievances of the\narea\u2019s residents.\n\u201cIf the king of Morocco is not convinced by the way political activity is\nconducted, and if he does not trust a number of politicians, what are the\ncitizens left with?\u201d he said.\nA candlelight vigil in Casablanca this month for the protester who died.

London and Portland, OR: Frank Cass Publishers, 2000. x By Porch, Douglas W Moshe Gershovich from Middle East Journal \u00a9 \n. \u201cFrance's relationship with its Moroccan Protectorate (1912-25) has generally been regarded as a happy one, especially when compared with that of neighboring Algeria, for at least three reasons. First, France's Moroccan policies were skillfully guided by the flamboyant Resident General Hubert Lyautey, whose patient \"oil-spot\" strategy of conquest and \"indirect\" methods of governing both avoided a bloody and divisive conquest and preserved much of Morocco's traditional political structure. Second, Moroccan soldiers acquired a reputation for ferocity and loyalty in two world wars that made them the Gurkas of the French army. Lastly, unlike Indochina and Algeria, the French retained the good sense to depart Morocco before they became totally engulfed in the tide of Moroccan nationalism, leaving behind a conservative government well-disposed to France. Moshe Gershovich amplifies this vision of a Franco-Moroccan past. He argues that Lyautey was essentially a pragmatist whose policies were forced on him by opponents of colonial expansion in Paris, by a dearth of soldiers available to complete the conquest, and by his growing conviction that Moroccan independence was inevitable. French Military Rule in Morocco: Colonialism and Its Consequences\u201d And I believe that Morocco is, much like Jordan, a staunch US and EU ally and  France that great and ancient civilization has much more of a role  in Morocco.\nFrance and US and EU not going to second guess Hassan  any more than  King Abdullah\nSee Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Syria\nBut lets be clear Mr Nasser Zafzazi  is not getting out soon but he will be pardoned\nWhen?\nRabat \u2013 Nasser Zafzafi, the detained leading activist of the Hirak protest movement in Rif region, has been transferred to the headquarters of the National Brigade of Judiciary Police (BNPJ), lawyer Khadija Rougani, a member of the activist\u2019s defense team, has announced. The lawyer said that Zafzafi\u2019s transfer to the BNPJ\u2019s headquarters is probably related to a letter attributed to Zafzafi that was published by media on Thursday. \u201cTo this point, it is not clear why he is under interrogation. The reason could mostly be the letter that circulated,\u201d Rougani said in a statement to Lakome2. Zafzafi has been under detentions in Oukacha Prision in Casablanca. He and dozens of other activists held in Casablanca and Al Hoceima are accused of several heavy crimes including \u201cundermining the security\u201d of the country. On Thursday, online media outlets published a letter attributed to Zafzafi urging the population of Al Hoceima to preserve in their endeavors until their \u201clegitimate demands\u201d are answered. He also warned his follow protesters against violence, calling such actions a betrayal of the movement\u2019s peaceful principles. \u201cHe who throws a stone has betrayed Hirak and the detainees, and he who breaks a glass is not [a member] of Hirak,\u201d reads the letter.
