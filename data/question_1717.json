This is a pace that is 25% less than the pace of homicides in the year to date. I find that, while the pace can definitely get slower, it will be hard to get to something much slower (e.g. 30% or 40% slower pace). So I tend to believe that the second bracket is more plausible. If the pace stays between a decrease by 7%, to 1.93 homicides per day, and an increase of up to +12% to about 2.32 homicides per day, then we are in the third bracket. Now if the pace increases, to 2.32 (+12% faster pace than so far), we cross into the fourth bracket. I don't assign much probability to an even faster homicide pace, so I will choose between 5% or 0%. Looked at the past years' homicide totals:\nhttps://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/02/us/chicago-murder-rate-2016-visual-guide/index.html\nAnd produced a Normal Distribution around these 20 years (from 2001-2019). The mean is just 1.43 and the standard deviation is 0.27. The standard deviation of the years that had the most homicides is not much different. I will use the standard deviation of 0.27, on the 756 extrapolated homicides for 2020. 676 total homicides for 2020 means 236 in the remaining 153 days (1.54 rate per day), which is much less than the year-so-far homicides rate of 2.06 (projecting to 756 total homicides). That is a dramatic drop for the remainder of the year and not very likely. I believe the normal distribution is skewed towards the left (towards lower homicides) because the pace is more likely to slow down than it is to speed up. So I will allocate 10% to the first bracket. 735 total homicides is 295 in the remainder of 2020 (1.93 rate per day). Still it is a slow down of 0.13 per day (-7% from current 2020 rate), which is half a standard deviation lower than the 2.06. That places it in the 31% probability (of total up to 735). Subtracting the 10% probability I assigned to the \"below 676\" bracket, leaves me with another 21% for the bracket of 676-735. The 795 homicides represents another 355 for the remainder of the year (2.32 rate per day). That is a significant increase, up from the already high outlier homicide rate of 2.06 we have seen in this year so far. Quite unlikely I would say, being about one standard deviation higher. This, applied on a normal distribution around 2.06 rate, gives me a probability of 16%. Considering a significant downwards skew (again, I believe the current high homicides rate can decrease but not as likely to increase), therefore I will round down the probability to 10% or even 5%. I choose 5% by intuition. The remaining 65% for the middle bracket, which (as a sense check):\n- contains the current extrapolated projection of 756, approximately smack in the middle.\n- on the low end is bordered by 736, which is 1.93 for the remainder of the year, or 2.01 overall rate in the year.\n- on the high end is bordered by 795, which is 2.32 for the remainder of the year, or 2.17 overall rate in the year.\nSounds like the most likely outcome."], [57778, "2020-08-14T09:53:36Z", [0.05, 0.28, 0.44, 0.23], ""], [57778, "2020-08-14T09:32:42Z", [0.0, 0.35, 0.35, 0.3], ""], [57778, "2020-08-14T04:26:58Z", [0.0, 0.28, 0.42, 0.3], ""], [88569, "2020-08-13T21:41:32Z", [0.04, 0.15, 0.31, 0.5], ""], [94632, "2020-08-13T20:45:56Z", [0.16, 0.75, 0.08, 0.01], "There are currently 452 homicides in Chicago for 2020 (https://graphics.suntimes.com/homicides/), meaning the projection is now around 733 homicides for the year, around 7 less than my projection 2 weeks ago.

The gangs are not thought to be only driven by criminal economic activity but act \"revolve around identity and solidarity among young people who find themselves in similar circumstances and share an identification with a particular neighbourhood.\"(3).  Combining this with an increased need for protection in the face of the rising crime rate it is fair to say that more people will be incentivised to join gangs. If the police are not able for whatever reason to arrest this increase (and thus far they have not) then it is likely the cycle of violence will continue.  To move onto numbers, @Calgacus has come up with \"5 months at 2 a day - 813, 5 months at 1.3 - 701, 3 months 2 then 2 at 1.3 - 759\".  There are some potential lower likelihood events that could push the numbers way up; a particularly deadly mass shooting ala the las vegas shooting if someone attacks a funeral with a greater arsenal than is currently being used. If hospitals became overwhelmed due to a spike in cases of coronavirus emergency rooms could become less effective and save fewer of those who are shot. If there is a protest movement which manages to remove police enforcement entirely from an area, like we saw in Seattle, then this could also have an impact. If there is earlier than usual cold weather this could also reduce the amount of homicides. A change in leadership or methods by the CPD before the end of the year is a possibility. A very sad question in which I hope the eventual number is as low as possible. 1/https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2020/7/22/21334970/gang-feud-mass-shooting-funeral-home-auburn-gresham 2/https://news.wttw.com/2020/07/27/critics-say-chicago-police-need-rethink-tracking-gang-members-curbing-violence 3/https://www.thetrace.org/2020/07/chicago-gang-gun-violence-law-enforcement/\n"], [1333, "2020-08-01T16:14:58Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.36, 0.54], ""], [93, "2020-08-01T16:14:12Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.65, 0.2], ""], [90167, "2020-08-01T13:36:20Z", [0.05, 0.3, 0.32, 0.33], ""], [94723, "2020-08-01T12:26:04Z", [0.95, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [86904, "2020-08-01T12:20:48Z", [0.1, 0.37, 0.38, 0.15], ""], [94602, "2020-08-01T11:16:57Z", [0.07, 0.22, 0.48, 0.23], ""], [67403, "2020-08-01T11:04:38Z", [0.4, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2], ""], [93271, "2020-08-01T09:39:31Z", [0.05, 0.25, 0.45, 0.25], "Base case is 2019 with ~500 homicides.\nStatistics first half year of 2020 is 329 homicides. With June scoring 75% higher than last year. When you take the next half year of homicides with the same increase of 75% compared to last year, that's 438 homicides. Plus the homicides already committed is 767. With a margin error of 50 you will get a case of 5%-25%-45%-25%. Is the 75% increase realistic? With the current economic outlook for the US and especially the mid-west you will see this correlation. That in combination with the segregation between black and white in the city of Chicago and the politics around black lives matter, I would say 75% increase is a good estimate. https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2020/7/1/21309399/june-crime-stats-chicago-police-david-brown-homicides-murders"], [94737, "2020-08-01T07:54:39Z", [0.0, 0.65, 0.25, 0.1], ""], [93502, "2020-08-01T07:30:30Z", [0.8, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0], "https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/chicago-murders-and-shootings-up-overall-crime-down-halfway-through-2020-police-say/2298155/ Here it says 329 till and of June. May June and July are the peak months. So, extrapolating this would give approximately 660 homicides.\nBut recent years the homicides were below 500, so this is an abnormality (specific increase/maybe gang wars/perhaps concentrated in the early months of the year) or an increase of homicides due to a new more violent reality (i.e. change of behavior, something that is expected to affect the rest of the year).\nI would be interested to see the time stamp of these homicides, if they are spread evenly, then it is a more violent year overall, if it is concentrated in a particular month, then it is something that we can\u2019t extrapolate to the entire year. Until then, I tend to believe that increase in the first half of the year has no reason to be an increase for the second half of the year as well. I will go with assuming the rest of 2020 goes like the yearly average (up to 500 homicides per year, thus 250 for half year) rather than a repeat of the former half.\nI will add 300 to the 329 of the first half which takes me to ~630.

Since 1985, the average murder rate in Chicago is around 25 in 100,000 residents, or about 675 homicides per year. This will serve as a historic mean. The highest rate on record is about 0.33%, or 891 homicides in a single year. At the end of June this year, Chicago was on pace for 658 murders despite a large uptick since last year, where there were a little over 500 for the entire year. As of July 29th, there were 432 murders, putting the projection at 740 for the year.
