What do you all think? Some of the add backs (because we don't really know) assuming they DUMP the ACA mandate repeal:\n1)Alternative minimum tax corporate - House wants full repeal = + 40B\n2) Corporate debt payments = +136B\n3) Allow state and local income taxes to be deducted above Senate version of only a limit of 10,000 for property taxes = +148B\n4) Don't repeal the ACA mandate (as the Senate version did) = + 348B Not sure what else they're thinking ( full repeal of the estate tax?) but the above alone  = 672 Billion If the conference committee retains the repeal of the ACA mandate in the bill, then they need to come up with (324 Billion) more to fill -- but they have political complications, especially with Susan Collins and other Senators that are much harder to deal with than moving numbers around. Don't think they're going to pass those healthcare bills to keep Susan Collins so they'll have to remove the mandate repeal to get her vote anyway.

Consider adding back 2% to the corporate tax rate cut making it 22% = equals $200 - 400 billion dependent on how they score it.. I'm guessing they score it on the higher end.  So, the question remains, will they increase the corporate tax rate to 22%? I think they will but it will be the very last thing that they do so that the floodgates to more things are closed.

(a) House chose to go to conference [50%] AND \n(b) The rate is adjusted above 20% in the consolidated bill [40%] AND \n(c) both Chambers passes the consolidated bill [80%] AND \n(d) done before then end of the year [50%] AND \n(e) President Trump doesn't object to the final bill [95%, there could be chances something new creeps up into the final bill that Trump doesn't like and don't underestimate the Republicans' ability to fumble] AND \n(f) Trump physically signs it [98%] Odds for the rate higher than 25% is null, since neither House nor Senate nor the White House talk of anything above 22%.

With that said, there's still some significant hurdles to overcome for the tax bill to be signed by Feb 16. First is the amount of time to get the work done. The Senate has 38 days (assuming the same work schedule as 2017 since they haven't published their 2018 calendar) and the House has 28. The House and Senate now need to go to conference and reconcile the differences between the two bills, which could be more difficult than the GOP would like to admit. Additionally, the conference bill would have to pass another \"Byrd bath\" by the Senate Parliamentarian, which limits some of the flexibility in the negotiations. Second, the WH seems to think a government shutdown would be a good thing, and the Dems are signalling they would be willing to oblige Trump on this issue. While unrelated to the tax bill, it could consume the better part of December and potentially January, especially if its just a series of stopgap bills. That would consume floor debate time, committee time, and negotiating time to keep the government open or to reopen, as a shutdown while controlling both houses and the WH is probably not a look the GOP would like to have. Thus, the looming threat of shutdown could push tax reform outside the window of this Question. Finally, don't discredit the possibility of Trump derailing efforts through some new distraction or debacle that requires Congressional action (actions against North Korea or Iran, starting a new conflict somewhere under the guise of AUMF, etc.). This could insert unnecessary delay into the tax process, putting it beyond the Feb 16 deadline for the Q. What the GOP does have going for it is the heating up of the Mueller investigation, and the tightening of the net around WH officials. I'm sure the GOP leadership is painfully aware of that, and is likely motivated to get tax reform done prior to any major developments that could incapacitate WH leadership. In that regard, the faster they go, the more warning signs they blow past, and the more procedural steps they ignore along the way, the more likely it is they achieve their goal of passing legislation. While in the long term this is an extremely shortsighted way to reshape the US economy, with the consequences (intended or unintended) lasting for years, it is the most effective way to prevent defections within the GOP or an organized response by external entities, thus improving the odds of success. I think the GOP will pass some form of tax reform. It's almost inevitable for them, especially since they've been able to bring on the holdouts. What I'm less confident about is getting it done by Feb 16, especially when a shutdown could further lessen the precious few legislative days both chambers have before that deadline. If Congress can pass a long term CR, then the path is essentially cleared of major legislative obstacles. So watch what happens over the next week (the current CR expires Dec 8), and the weeks following if Congress can only achieve a stopgap measure or if a shutdown occurs."], [32258, "2017-12-02T18:11:24Z", [0.95, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0], "I don't expect the House to pass the Senate version of the bill and believe it goes to conference committee to negotiate the differences in the two bills.

The tax reform is already a challenge, with the House and Senate having different priorities for the new tax bill. And with the inclusion of the ACA mandate repeal, this becomes even more challenging. Right now, neither bill would pass a \"Byrd bath\" in the Senate to ensure compliance with reconciliation procedures, which further complicates the process, especially if the Senate passes their version and it goes to conference.  Beyond all this, the proposed bills are not very popular at the moment. The GOP made it clear that the impetus for this push is to appease its donor base, which, news flash, are the people who would most benefit form either of these bills. And with the targeting of blue states, this will make it even harder for GOP congressmen in competitive districts to support this effort as currently written in either form.  Putting aside the issues with the tax bills, Congress has some major issues that it's neglecting in favor of the tax push; namely, the FY18 budget. The Continuing Resolution ends on December 8th, and the Dems have significant leverage to force some issues, to include revamping the tax bills, otherwise they can shut down the government. And as the GOP showed during 2013, the Dems can do so without any real consequences at the polls in 2018. Additionally, both parties need to agree to raise the budget caps implemented in the 2011 Budget Control Act by passing a bipartisan budget agreement. Otherwise, failing to do that, sequestration cuts would automatically take effect, cutting over $50 billion from the DOD appropriation and $38 billion from the non-defense appropriations, plus cuts to mandatory spending programs such as Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare. I can't say for sure, but I don't think the GOP would like to have the narrative of not being able to fully fund the government, particularly DOD and national security. The budget environment is not favorable to the GOP at the moment, and once the bills get scored by CBO (before or after voted on in the chambers before conference), the outlook is likely to be even more bleak for passing comprehensive tax legislation. Of course, the GOP could ignore the warning signs and assume that it will already be voted out of power in 2018, so damn the electorate and pass the legislation it wants.
