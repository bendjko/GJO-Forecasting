Washington still has the Panthers to play, and they're favored. I still feel good about that game. So that puts them at 4 wins. That means they need one more...they have the Cowboys on Thanksgiving! A huge game and a huge tradition. I don't feel as good as I felt about that game earlier in the month. The Cowboys have Andy Dalton back and they just beat the Vikings. Plus, they have the best winning percentage on Thanksgiving among teams with 10 or more games and they're 8-1(!) against Washington on Thanksgiving (https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/11/23/washington-football-nfc-east-three-wins/). Washington is 3-8 on Thanksgiving overall AND the Cowboys are getting three points from Vegas on Thursday. SO! I'm not feeling as good. Be that as it may, I gave them a 25% shot when they needed three more wins, and they have one of the three I thought they'd get. I don't feel as good about the Dallas game, but I still feel okaaaay, and the more I see of Philly, the more I think they've got a chance to win against Philly at the end of the season. The way I see it, that game might mean tanking for a high pick or (incredibly) winning for a chance to get into the playoffs. So of the games they have left, I feel good about beating the Panthers, and I think they have an ok shot to beat either the Cowboys or the Eagles.  So I'm going to ooch up my projection ever-so-slightly. I'm gonna move them up to 50% for now and see how things go.
