I suspect demand for vegetable oils will remain high. I suspect that cereal prices will rise at some point; perhaps crops will not fare as well as expected, and reduced stocks will likely drive up prices as well. I bet meat prices will be sustained or increased in part by continuing increases in demand in China, driven by high growth rates for the Chinese economy as a whole. Sugar prices could fall a bit further if India ends up exporting a lot of sugar. I suspect dairy prices will decline a bit over the coming year as short-term and seasonal constraints ease. Overall, I can picture vegetable oils, cereals, and possibly meat prices driving up the index further, and dairy and sugar potentially pulling it down a bit, with a net result of an additional increase of maybe 10% to 30% by the end of the year, corresponding to index values of 129 to 153.

These two likely also have the heaviest weight in the basket of five subsegments.

While Sugar was a third sector with drastic price changes in both of these cases, it does not play a role this year obviously, as world supply for export from the Northern hemisphere could be sufficient.\nMy guess is prices will continue to rise in H12021, before they drop moderately in H22021 with the harvest in the Northern hemispere (e.g. wheat production in Russia largely determines the world export price for wheat) towards the end of the year.\nForecast: above, but near 100.0, maybe 102.5"], [691, "2021-03-19T19:00:41Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.21, 0.57, 0.22], ""], [86554, "2021-03-19T19:00:16Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.12, 0.51, 0.37], ""], [86554, "2021-03-19T18:59:25Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.28, 0.51, 0.21], ""], [529, "2021-03-19T18:41:31Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.17, 0.74, 0.09], "The Feb. 2021 most recently reported FAO Food Price index value was 116.0, the highest number since 2015.

So I think there's a good chance the index continues to rise through 2021. However, the US sounds like it's one of the larger food producers, so if the US can get its economy back to a relative normal this summer maybe it can bring food prices back down a bit which might keep the FAO index from rising so much.
