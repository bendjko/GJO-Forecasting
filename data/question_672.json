Prices on CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) fell to $9,972.29 yesterday, before witnessing a quick recovery to $11,000 levels. This is the fourth time in last week that bitcoin (BTC) has recovered losses after sinking below $10,000 levels. As of writing, bitcoin is at $10,990 levels. The cryptocurrency has appreciated by 3.38 percent in the last 24 hours, according to data source OnChainFX. On Coinbase's GDAX exchange, BTC witnessed two-way business yesterday with prices hitting highs and lows of $$11, 370 and $9,945, respectively, before closing (as per UTC) at $10,824 levels. The situation looks no different today as the rebound from the intraday low of $10,450 seems to have run out of steam above $11,000 levels. The cryptocurrency was last seen changing hands on GDAX at $10,970 levels. The two-way price action witnessed in the last 24 hours is indicative of indecision in the marketplace and a decisive move (in either direction) would likely set the tone for the market. That said, the price chart analysis today puts the odds of a decisive move higher above 50 percent. -- https://www.coindesk.com/building-a-base-bitcoin-demand-at-10k-hints-at-move-higher/"], [691, "2018-01-24T12:07:04Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.98], ""], [42162, "2018-01-24T11:57:51Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.34, 0.65], ""], [41389, "2018-01-24T11:33:45Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.04, 0.1, 0.85], "With a daily vol of 5.1% and annualized vol of 80% of price change on bitcoin I see it as a high probability it will close above $10K with only three trading days left.

Churn still is spectacularly high. For example, from 8AM to 9AM MST today, ~ 3 million Bitcoins changed hands amid a drop in price bottoming out at ~$12,870. Those three million Bitcoins represent ~ one fifth of all Bitcoins in existence.  I still cannot imagine how the price isn't more volatile, given the lack of underlying value  and the churn rate.  The only reason I am giving such a high probability to >$10K is that the behavior of the overall system bespeaks some sort of collusion to keep the little guys in the game -- AKA marks, AKA suckers, the guys who read make money fast in Bitcoin ads in the airline magazines. The basic problem facing Bitcoin users is that many of them are using it to launder money. The big problem overall is how to convert Bitcoin into fiat money, meaning currencies backed by governments. Right now, billions of USD equivalent dollars are being churned and some of it is being extracted permanently rather than reinvested, day trader style. That I believe is a good hypothesis given the churn rate. But the only way to permanently extract laundered money from the Bitcoin system is to have new  investors/marks/suckers stepping up[ to buy when prices fall. Therefore it is important for the big guys (AKA whales AKA organized crime AKA kleptocratic world leaders and their hangers on) to keep the suckers from spooking. That means not being greedy, feeding money back into the system  as needed, perhaps with some encrypted communications to determines who steps up to the plate when. If I am wrong, sometime soon, maybe before the forecast horizon, the whales will let Bitcoin collapse below $10K. They may let it collapse because they already have extracted all they need . It may be that  whenever the price falls too fast, it now is the suckers en mass who rush in with bargain buying, what a deal!!!  If the price is now mostly being stabilized by the suckers, here is what I know about small time day traders. They typically are male and typically think they are geniuses. They buy in the morning and cash out all their positions by bed time. Or vice versa if unemployed and with a modest inheritance to gamble. But the problem with Bitcoin day traders is that, compared with stocks, it costs more on average to buy and sell and it takes longer for a trade to sell Bitcoins to result in money in the bank. So this increases the danger that Mom or The Wife may discover a big savings deficit and put an end to it.

Normally this high churn rate would predict high volatility and high likelihood of a crash below $10K.

So I'm counting on the bears to refrain from killing the goose that lays their golden eggs.\n4) The \"hodlers\" (not a misspelling) appear to hold a religious level of belief that if they hang on to their coins, someday each will be worth ~$1M. Therefore Bitcoin won't tottaly collapse, and in the near term they may hold enough coins to maintain a floor above $7K.\n5) The ranks of the \"marks\" will continue to gain new members to replace the old ones who have lost their life savings to the whales. These people, I am guessing from my observations of past scams, are mostly gullible U.S. males. U.S. female marks usually fall for multilevel marketing schemes because they get adrenaline out of trying but over and over again with each new scheme, to exploit fellow church members, friends and family, a joy not available in the anonymity of cryptocurrencies.  But U.S. male marks who are in it partly for the adrenaline, are more likely to be day traders (in and out of the market within a day) and the volatility of Bitcoin will be an enticement, rather than a warning to stay away.\n6) Non-U.S. marks -- I don't know what motivates these small players outside the U.S. Motivations probably vary by culture. Love of gambling may be a big factor. How much of the casino trade depends upon the crowds, ladies of the night, substance abuse, and noise, and how much upon speculation, stripped of the trappings of the casinos?\n7) I have observed and Phil Tetlock has written a book about how very wrong are \"expert\" forecasters.

South Korea ban, I suspect  it is a way to control or curtail North Korean incursions within its jurisdiction without directly accusing North Korea.  There is uncertainty around the timing of bitcoin volatility, so my 100% is not a real figure. Reasons being to resolve the q to one dollar less than the highest bin, the price would have to drop by about 50% of total current value which is, yes,  quite likely. It would have to stay that way at 11:59:59 second on Jan 26 which I think is quite unlikely, as volatility is not just downward, (this is a expectation bias ) it is multi-directional, especially for new products where there are a lot of unknowns - and crypto is a new frontier entirely. Maybe it wouldn't recoup the entire amount of the drop at one second to midnight, Jan 26. Perhaps the gain wouldn't stick for the medium or long-term but not a long g term question  IOW, China ban = little effect on price (because, I think, bitcoin consumers don't need or want bank accounts and identification)  I don't see Russia or India, or Africa central banks banning bitcoin.  Also I wonder if central banks banning bitcoin has effect of constraining already limited (21 million coin) supply and raising prices.  Other money functions (store of value, med of exchange, unit of account) seem to be gaining traction, not waning, and new functions of money are starting to appear such as paperless (or boundary-free), and new ways of generating business - these are not likely to just go away so, I'm guessing,  bitcoin is more likely to retain value in spite of volatility.

That's 1/6 of a percent of the market cap in one swell foop! That's why I ascribe much of the current trading volume to whales. I don't think this action could be called a casino, unless it is like Rick's in Casablanca. I'm assuming the whales are getting rich off the novice traders, colluding like heck because this is a totally unregulated marketplace. If this is the case, they will protect their golden goose for a long, long time. If I'm wrong, it will crash. One way it could crash -- the marks, the suckers, are now driving up the price of other crypto currencies. Example, Litecoin, created in 2011 by Charlie Lee, and worth almost nothing until, bam! And Lee just cashed out his happily gotten gains.  https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/20/litecoin-charlie-lee-conflict-of-interest/ There must be a sucker born every nanosecond nowadays, perhaps enough of a supply to keep the 1,000+ cryptocurrencies floating upward and onward.

I'm not expecting much likelihood of a crash to below $10K, given the influx of marks and the futures markets. There appears to be too much motivation, and too much control by the whales, to let it drop that fast.  OTOH I could be wrong! Tulip bulbs!

Both of these factors make me think that BTC may double or triple in the coming year, and therefore be above $10K on Jan 26, 2018. And of course -- in the coming year, it may fall in half as well. Those probabilities would be interesting to guess. Firstly, this explanation of the benefits of cryptos in general: http://www.businessinsider.com/cryptocurrency-value-explained-by-crypto-hedge-fund-cio-ari-paul-2017-11 The commentator describes legal offshore banking - a $20 trillion market which is participated in by HNW individuals and large corporations like Apple, Amazon etc. When I first thought of BTC from the \"store of value\" perspective as competing with gold - which has a market cap in the $7-9 trillion range depending on the price at a particular point in time. I thought back-of-the-envelope that to serve that function, the 21M BTC that will ultimately be in circulation would be worth about $400K each ($8T/21M). So if it reaches 20% of that, we're at an $80K BTC. Of course, it may only do some fraction of that as well. If the BTC demand swells still further for some portion of the $20T offshore market, the price would be still higher. If BTC is seen over time to be a safer storage form for 20% of offshore assets, we are seeing about a $200K BTC. That would also take years to evolve, but points to a valuable application. Combining the gold use case and the offshore use case, we have a $280K BTC. I don't use these rather insane sounding numbers to suggest that the current valuation of $12K is reasonable, but to point out that there is a case for BTC to actually have value and function that could explain higher valuations. Not necessarily in the $100K+ range near-term, but possibly eventually. So looking at BTC and thinking it is \"overvalued\" simply because $12K seems like a large number may be a case of anchoring bias -- we tend to rely on the first piece of information we are presented with -- in this case, the historic price: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring That is why I am trying to derive a more fundamental evaluation of the price. Still speculative, but pointing more to the intrinsic value as far as I'm able. Interested in alternatives. The speaker describes the banking case for increasing the accuracy and speed of transactions in the back office, producing cost savings that could cut bank's back offices in half. Meanwhile, he notes that the futures market will allow pensions and endowments to begin entering the market in the coming months -- starting slowly in about three months, and in greater quantities in the following six to eighteen months. This is following the earlier institutional activity by VCs and family offices for instance. But the endowments and pensions represent tens of trillions of dollars in AUM. Pensions are about $32T alone: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_assets_under_management With respect to the futures market implications more generally, I don't understand much about the futures market, and think I understand about 30% of this article in the FT, so happy to be corrected in any details if someone more knowledgable feels like translating. My general sense of the tenor is that the futures markets are likely to increase activity and participation, though I would say the article's tenor is tepid overall: https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2017/11/29/2196222/why-bitcoin-futures-and-a-shoddy-market-structure-pose-problems/ When I try to think of the downsides, I don't think they relate very much to \"fundamentals\" - the downside is simply that everyone is saying this is all speculative. Absolutely possible. In terms of other types of downside -- one that I see for BTC overall is energy consumption. Apparently BTC is consuming as much energy as 159 countries: http://www.newsbtc.com/2017/11/29/bitcoin-mining-causes-increase-in-energy-consumption/ This poses a regulatory risk with the concerns about energy consumption overall, as well as a scaling problem that may impede adoption or see another crypto supercede BTC.

In this shorter timeframe therefore the probability of exceeding the current price (over $10K today) seems still higher. I have been considering an interesting paper that looks at stock bubbles, from NBER: http://www.nber.org/papers/w23191.pdf Which I learned of through a pessimistic article in Market Watch: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-chance-of-a-bitcoin-crash-is-greater-than-80-2017-11-27 This research is a persuasive argument that a 40% price drop occurs within two years for 80% assets that see a greater than 100% increase in a short time period (I'm not clear on the time period, but evidently BTC has been a record-setting increase so surely qualifies). So why bet against this analysis? My own inclination for the evaluation of BTC is that it actually already had its speculative bubble burst -- in late 2013 BTC made a run that saw its price rise about 10X, then fall about 40% (as this paper predicts). To me, BTC surviving this event and now being adopted by institutions, getting serious attention from regulators, beginning to penetrate the awareness of retail investors, etc. This isn't to say there couldn't be more than one bubble for a single asset class -- oil has had many bubbles and shocks -- but my guess is that the recent rise reflects more of an understanding of the fundamental value of BTC in helping preserve people's wealth, better documenting ownership, the potential to reduce fees and be more portable, cross borders etc. Benefits that have yet to be realised overall, but which are very promising.

Who knows what moves the price? The entire market is relatively small compared to the wealth of some hedge funds (and maybe even some individuals) so it could just be the behavior of a few actors with large stakes that accounts for most price moves.  The most hilarious comment was this: \"Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz said that bitcoin \"ought to be outlawed\" because \"it doesn\u2019t serve any socially useful function.\" For a contrary view on how Anglo-American law worked for centuries, see the maxim https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_which_is_not_forbidden_is_allowed I love it when economists are that completely convinced they know what serves social utility. Why is Stiglitz being consulted about Bitcoin? Has he researched it cryptocurrencies or something? Learned about it? Or is this like when Thomas Friedman says or writes things? Edit: hey, here's an economist who thought some more about cryptocurrencies:\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-ubs-wealth-management-economist-paul-donovan-2017-11\nHe argues crypto currencies (1) can't be widely used b/c gvts will ban them because they can't tax them (but the U.S.'s IRS anyway is working on that, starting to investigate exchanges... a judge just helped the Service's investigation move forward), seems if they can succeed in banning crypto they could succeed in taxing crypto (and as much as people hate taxes on stuff they like, they hate bans even more); (2) cannot be used as a medium exchange because they're not a stable source of value b/c new, better crypto currencies can replace former crypto... I think the jury is still out on this as well... obviously bitcoin so far is NOT a stable store of value now relative to many countries' fiat currencies, but there may be a network effect from many users and the physical infrastructure required to mine bit coins and, once all have been mined, offer low transaction fees & security resulting from the difficulty of having had so much infrastructure required.

The camp that conceded had been hoping to double the number of transactions that could be run through the network that supports Bitcoin, in order to keep transactions cheap and fast.\nThis expansion was vociferously opposed by many of the programmers working on the Bitcoin project, who worried that expanding the network quickly would make it easier for a company or government to exert influence over the decentralized system. The group pushing for expansion had planned to switch to a new version of the Bitcoin software next week, which would have created a split in the network and most likely wreaked havoc on the virtual currency. This planned split, though, was called off on Wednesday, after the companies proposing it failed to win significant support from the Bitcoin community. In an email, the leaders of several of the largest Bitcoin companies said that \u201cunfortunately, it is clear that we have not built sufficient consensus for a clean block size upgrade at this time.\u201d The price of Bitcoin shot up immediately after the email went out, hitting a new high, above $7,800, before retreating. The price has been steadily climbing and is up nearly 1,000 percent over the last year. The rising price has attracted many new users, from places like Japan and South Korea and from big hedge funds, even as the authorities in places like China have cracked down on the currency. All of the new people seeking access to Bitcoin have run up against a limit on the number of transactions that can flow through the system every 10 minutes, which was put in place during Bitcoin\u2019s early years. Because of the limit, the network can process only around five transactions a second. That has led to delays on the network and has pushed up the price of getting a Bitcoin transaction through. Companies that help process Bitcoin payments have been pushing to lift the limit on Bitcoin transactions for several years, arguing that it will be necessary if Bitcoin wants to compete with Visa or PayPal. The opposing camp has argued that quickly expanding the number of transactions flowing through the network would mean only large companies could track Bitcoin transactions, taking power away from individual users. The proponents of keeping the so-called blocks of Bitcoin transactions small said Bitcoin should be viewed more as digital gold: a secure place to keep money, even if it can\u2019t be moved around as quickly and cheaply. Many of the programmers working on the basic Bitcoin software \u2014 the so-called core developers \u2014 said they would stop working on Bitcoin if the block size was increased. They also complained that the companies pushing through the block size increase were doing so without properly consulting the community. Leaders on both sides of the Bitcoin debate have complained about receiving death threats and hacking attacks, and some top developers have migrated toward other virtual currencies. In August, some of the most outspoken proponents of expanding Bitcoin created their own version, known as Bitcoin Cash, which can handle more transactions than traditional Bitcoin. The price of Bitcoin Cash has gone up since August, but it remains only a small fraction of the size of Bitcoin. On Wednesday, the companies that had been pushing for big blocks said they were calling off their plans in order to restore some measure of peace to the community. \u201cAlthough we strongly believe in the need for a larger block size, there is something we believe is even more important: keeping the community together,\u201d the email said. The announcement said that the companies still believed that an increase in the size of Bitcoin blocks would be necessary, but that they were willing to wait until the community agreed on a way to deal with the issue. The people opposed to quickly expanding the network say they still wanted to make it easier and cheaper to use Bitcoin. But they hope this will be made possible by new networks built on top of Bitcoin, keeping the Bitcoin network itself more secure and decentralized."], [691, "2017-11-09T20:01:57Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.48, 0.52, 0.0], ""], [14667, "2017-11-09T19:08:18Z", [0.0, 0.09, 0.39, 0.3, 0.22], ""], [32122, "2017-11-09T17:09:12Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.8, 0.2], "Ok here we go.  I think it's futile to even attempt a valuation or reasonable price argument with this \"alternative asset class.\"   We can say that Bitcoin is seen as the \"gold standard\" of crypto-currencies, so it should probably go up more and recover faster than others in terms of price action.  But that tendency in price action can be expressed by an actual valuation that is far from the current price by the end of January 2018. Anyway, I think its better to concentrate on a technical analysis of the chart.  It looks like a parabolic rise to me, which is a buyers panic scenario.  Right now we are over $7,000, so it would not be impossible to breach $10,000.  But I am assuming some moderation before eventually advancing, so I am focusing on the $7-$10M range.   What can go wrong here?  This is probably bubbly price action, which could fall apart for any or no reason at any time.  The price could go down quite a lot in a matter of days.

In August, a group of former Bitcoin supporters created Bitcoin Cash, a totally separate virtual currency that makes it easier to do small transactions, like paying for a cup of coffee.

The battle is expected to come to a head this month when new Bitcoin software, backed by many of the biggest virtual currency start-ups, is released. Most of the programmers who maintain the Bitcoin software have opposed the changes because they say it would make it harder for individuals to track their own Bitcoins. Some of the computers on the network are likely to update to the new software while others stay with the existing rules, creating a split, or fork, in the network that would result in two separate Bitcoins.\n -A Bitcoin fork could prove disruptive and drive away investors. \n ~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  Bitcoin has been pretty resilient.

First I have to give credit and thank mwokasch. I have used his prediction as a base line due to it's good assumptions and logic. However I have added some of my own assumptions. 2. The fact is that there is still 80 days to go until the deadline of the prediction (26 January 2017). The last 80 day growth of Bitcon/USD has been 85% - from 21 August 2017 price of 3987.52 to 07 November 2017 price of 7377,02. If such growth were to continue in the next 80 days Bitcoin price would reach 13 647,6868 USD by 26 January 2018. In reverse if the price would fall the same percentile amount the price would value 1106,4 USD by 26 January 2017. 3. I assume more focus on the positive growth and short term \u201estatus quo\u201c continuation in Bitcoin value change as it is very difficult to foresee transpiring of possible events that could negatively impacts Bitcoin value \u2013 market/wallet hacks, regulation, general market correction, devaluation in other currency.\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2017/11/05/coping-with-bitcoins-volatility/#4be09a1362ec  3. My \"biggest\" assumption is however that Bitcoin is becoming a popular instrument with its trading volumes increasing \u2013 a somewhat Bitcoin \u201ecraze\u201c is developing. I assume in the short term this trend will continue \u2013 there being more demand than supply (new Bitcoins are released in a limited fashion).\nHence I predict that in the next 80 days this increase in Bitcoin price will continue thus giving more percentile value to higher price numbers.\nOne of the evidence supporting growing demand of Bitcoin is the Blockchain.info data and graph on how Blockchain wallets have been growing in the last year\nhttps://blockchain.info/charts/my-wallet-n-users\nYTD growth has been 68% from 10 992 in 1 January 2017 to 18 471 on 7 November 2017. Hence in comparison I see there to be a bigger chance of Bitcoin USD value reaching the highest price bracket (more than $10,000) than mwokasch (my 20% vs his 11%). I also place less confidence on the $4000-$7000 bracket (my 25% to his 38%) due to the price having passed 7000 mark and my \"optimism\" regarding the future growth of Bitcoin price in the near term future.

So Bitcoin is nearly 4 times as volatile as the typical stock.   Before we can convert volatility into probability we need to have an estimate with what the average return investors expect to take on this astronomical amount of risk.  Now according to Finance (Black-Scholes option pricing model), this would be the \"risk-free rate\" over that duration Black-Scholes Midpoint: $6,111 However, Black-Scholes assumes that pricing is rational in an arbitrage free world. I highly suspect that bitcoin pricing violates both of these axioms.  As such, I've moved the midpoint up considerably to adjust for the abnormal environment in which Bit Coin trades.  Said differently, if investors don't see a huge return on their investment immediately (even though they shouldn't expect this), volatility is likely to increase further.   mwokasch Adjusted Midpoint: $6,475\nNote:  My midpoint adjustment makes virtually no difference amid such wild volatility, It's impact is essentially moving 4% from the top bracket to the bottom two brackets.  Applying the normal-distribution curve on top of a Midpoint of $6,475, annual standard deviation of 79.8% results in my forecast probabilities.
