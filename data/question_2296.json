Every day the case averages over that required minimum to reach 3.6 million reduces the average that needs to be held.

Canada actually experienced a lower peak in terms of cases/100,000 than the UK. If BA.2 is much more transmissable but those infected with BA.1 are unlikely to catch it again, that might point to the possibility that Canada could see a significantly larger spike than the UK this time around as there is a larger susceptible population.

If anyone has saved copies of a lot of old .csv files it would be interesting to get an idea of how far back they will make changes. The change I noticed was ~60 cases added in the 15 March total when the 16 March data was added.  Changes that are small and go back a day can probably be ignored.  It might be bigger revisions around holidays and weekends though as that seems to be the nature of CoVID case reporting data.  There may have been bigger changes also.  I remember seeing a reported daily case number around 2500 a few days ago but the lowest number in the recent .csv rows is 3500.  This may be some kind of intraday update that may be unrelated to changing past date totals. The question wording may be confusing for this style of data updating as the time the data is read will impact the resolution.  There is ambiguity about time of reporting vs which row of the .csv file (which date) would be read.  The top line says that the 3,600,000 or higher must be reported before 1 May but the fine print allows for data access until 5 May.  One interpretation of resolution is reading the Canada total from the map graphic at 11:59PM on 30 April (maybe even reading it constantly up to that time if cases can also be revised lower).  A second interpretation is that the .csv file could be accessed up to 5 May 11:59PM and the Canada - Total Cases - from April 30th will be used to resolve.    I am not sure which resolution style seems more likely.  Resolving based on the April 30th Total cases and allowing for updates of that total to 5 May seems very reasonable but I am not sure how that gets wedged into 'Canada reported x cases before 1 May' when the number is clearly being reported after 1 May.  The total cases displayed next to the map appears important to the resolution criteria but reading that number up to 5 May would mean including data and total cases a few days after the 1 May date in the top line.
