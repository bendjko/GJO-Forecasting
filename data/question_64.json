A clear diplomatic message by the Russian Govt. doing business w/ Japanese Govt. has a higher priority than the previous disagreements. The quote by Deputy Prime Minister Morgulov  reference political differences \"need to be freed as soon as possible\" signals time is of the essence, at least from the Russians. Which is consistent with Putins increasingly difficult geopolitical and domestic calculations. With no real OPEC agreement on limiting oil production on the horizon ( NB: upcoming meeting looks fraught w/ uncertainties), Putin will from a domestic perspective can argue internally to Russians \"job well done for the time being in Russian\".  That said, the gap left by the price of oil today relative to their ongoing budget requirements leaves Russia still close to dire economic straights. Carrying out his shorter term Syrian objectives had substantial financial cost as well.  And, one might argue, both the naval and, military base in Tartus will continue to generate substantial cost. Clearly, a significant interest to his overall ME strategy. Putin now stepping back for the time being in Syria will not be enough to generate a return to reasonable economic conditions. He needs to show internally he has proper plans in place to improve economic development in Russia.  The above-mentioned may be a piece to this puzzle/dilemma he is now attempting to balance.  Whether PM Abe ( w/ his appropriate G7 global status) is willing to meet w/ Putin for purely renewing economic talks seems still like a low probably event at this stage. At least from the Japanese perspective. Finally, from a geopolitical perspective being a G7 member, PM Abe would likely be extremely unwilling to take on mantel of being the first G7 member to meet w/ Mr. Putin who remains in both the U.S., EU & U.N. dog house in terms of international sanctions. Still.  That would seem like an easy answer. And, whether it ever leads to a meeting b/w Putin & Abe is another v low probability event. Yet, we still have a 90 day window of opportunity available before 1/7/16 deadline to question.  So, I am now going to follow this one because it seems like a harder question. For these reasons, I found the following note ( also SPUTNIK) in late February w/ Japan's Trade Minister Hayashi where he \"underscored importance of cooperation\" w/ Russia is certain business areas.\nhttp://sputniknews.com/business/20160229/1035524868/russia-japan-trade.html A final point, although still a low probability event, one thing we have all learned from Putin is - not to underestimate his limitations.  In spite of global sanctions post the Ukraine & Crimea. Here in EU land,  for example, the Ongoing Syrian tragedy showed, once again, how powerless it is to fill a military vacuum left by decisions made under the Obama administration. Putin filled the gap and, effectively increased the flow of refugees here which still goes on.

After some more research, it became clear that Russia sent their foreign minister to attend in 2014, and since then Russia has stated no new agenda items have come up that would instill a desire to participate. Looking further back at these summits, Putin has never actually attended, leading no reason to believe he would attend this year. Combined with Putin\u2019s hothead personality who doesn\u2019t go back on statements, I reduced the forecast to 6%. In reasoning, however, I also looked to other key players who can influence this decision in the opposite direction. Specifically, North Korea recently tested a hydrogen bomb. Because of Putin\u2019s proximity to North Korea and the global concern with their tactics, he might feel compelled to attend the summit and play a dominating role about how to curb North Korea (likely with some underlying political interests here).

I am looking for military historians with some knowledge of military parades and honor guards, specifically Russian honor guards. My specific question is this: In various film clips of Putin moving around government facilities he is seen passing various honor guards. These guards typically stand at attention as he approaches, and salute as he draws near. This, to my mind, is fairly typical of honor guards throughout the world. What I've seen, then, however, is something that strikes me as atypical. The honor guard, unlike most others I've seen that keep their gaze directly ahead, actually turn their head, at an exaggerated angle, so as to follow Putin with their gaze. As one who enjoys using proper names for various phenomena, I am seeking the name of this particular activity. That is, the turning of the head in an exaggerated fashion bit. [Edit: Here's a video of Putin's presidential inauguration ceremony in the Kremlin. The action of the honor guard I am referring to may be seen at the 14:20 mark. The guard on the right delivers the action in the more exaggerated fashion. The guard on the left did the action \"poorly\" and it looks like he's just turning his head naturally to follow Putin. The action may not have a name, but I'm guessing it does.]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNiWnSOsAnE"], [691, "2016-02-06T15:01:36Z", [0.03], ""], [1928, "2016-02-06T09:07:01Z", [0.5], ""], [102, "2016-02-06T04:42:39Z", [0.08], ""], [306, "2016-02-05T21:51:37Z", [0.0], ""], [306, "2016-02-05T21:51:08Z", [0.65], ""], [498, "2016-02-05T17:56:15Z", [0.75], "TASS reports: Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is expected to visit Russia in April or May \nhttp://nvs24.com/news/world/Japanese-PM-to-visit-Russia-this-spring-meet-with-Putin-media-3341401.html Presuming Abe to Russia occurs first, and reported timing is a reasonable estimate, this information makes a Putin to Japan turn-around visit within timeframe less likely.

The answer to this question is no. Based on Putin's track record of never visiting Japan, my probabilistic estimate of Putin visiting Japan before 1 July 2016 would be fairly low - I would give it 20 to 1 odds, or 5%.   Next, I asked myself if Putin has  publicly announced any intentions of visiting Japan. Surprisingly, the answer to this question is yes. Putin agreed several months ago to visit Japan. However, no date was set for the meeting. Based on this information, I would increase my odds from 20 to 1 to 2 to 1 or 50%.  Based on this information, I asked myself what the REASON for the meeting between Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Putin would be. The answer to this question is that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wishes to negotiate the \"Northern Territories Dispute\" (http://www.ibtimes.com/japans-shinzo-abe-calls-summit-russias-vladimir-putin-over-northern-territories-2247350). This dispute is over islands that were annexed by Soviet forces during the Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation after the end of World War II. The San Francisco Peace Treaty with Japan from 1951 states that Japan must give up all claims to the Kuril Islands, but it also does not recognize the Soviet Union's sovereignty over the Kuril Islands.  Thus, Japan is basically saying \"Hey, I know that the US said that we can't have these islands and we know you have them now, but we still want them. So can we please have them if we ask really nicely? Pretty please???\" Putin has a track record of 1) being a tough guy, and 2) trying to expand Russia (think Crimea). I heard Japan's Prime Minister speak at Harvard last year, he's a smart guy but he is not going to negotiate these islands away from Putin. Thus, I suspect that a meeting between the two leaders will be for public show more than anything.  Having studied Putin's leadership style, I know that Putin is going to want to have the balance of power tilted in his direction on any negotiations over these islands. This is why he is getting the Japanese Prime Minister to meet with him in Russia this spring (http://www.reuters.com/article/us-g20-turkey-russia-japan-idUSKCN0T518F20151116). Putin wants to negotiate on his own turf where he has more power in the negotiation.  After the meeting in Russia, I suspect that Putin will continue to postpone his visit to Japan until the trip is forgotten. This is a typical Russian political tactic.  In conclusion: 1. Putin has never visited Japan.\n2. Putin has agreed to visit Japan, but has not set a specific date.\n3. Putin has very little to gain from a visit to Japan.\n4.

A copy is below.  The caption states, \"Japan is considering the question of Putin's visit in July.\" I also went through a few upcoming political and sporting events.  A timeline with thoughts:   Early spring:  \nAbe to Russia.  We already have multiple posts here, of the possible Abe Visit to Russia in the first half of 2016. As for Putin reciprocating, I can see him traveling in late July, as very likely. This is because...  Late April - May: \nThe 42nd G7 Summit, hosted by Abe, will be held in Japan at the end of May 2016.  RU has not been invited back into the group. Abe will be likely, be quite involved, organizing G7 details during this time.  There is the possibility of bundling Putin in at this time, but political tensions from the G7 and the upcoming UN meeting in June, would be present. It is also probably too soon for Putin-Abe to do a follow up meeting late spring - early summer. I also believe both parties want their meetings to stand independent from all other events, until they near a resolution.  June:\nThe UN Security Council is meeting in late June. Big elections. Plus many will be lobbying for Ban Ki Moon's position (ending 31 Dec 2016) at this meeting. Putin will attend.  July: \nRussia is hosting the 7th Annual BRICS Summit in early July.  In the months leading up to July, there will be plenty of time to plan for another meeting. So... Abe hosting Putin later this month is a possibility.    August:\nSince 2000, Putin has traveled outside Russia five times during this month.  Two of those visits were to the Olympics. Putin often (very often) bundles state meetings around big sporting events.  This year, Putin will be alongside Rousseff at the Olympics to hand the flag over to the Rio mayor.  He is also scheduled to meet with Rousseff during this visit.  In short, Putin will be busy in Brazil.  September-October:\nThe G20 meets early this month. Abe and Putin will attend. A side meeting could happen here, or, another Abe-Putin meeting could happen soon after. North Korea's Party Foundation Day happens in early October. Putin has traveled to NK in autumn. Their relationship could factor in to an Abe-Putin meeting at this time.  December:\nRussia hosts the World Cup in 2018 meaning Putin (highly involved in the process already) will be in Japan in December to watch enjoy the event as well as oversee how the event is organized and run. Another meeting, or, even a possible (but highly unlikely) celebratory conclusion to previous meetings, could take place around the FIFA event.   Here is the Google translation of Dima-K's article, that includes the caption:  TOKYO, December 22 - RIA Novosti, Ivan Zakharchenko. Determination of the date of the visit of Russian President Vladimir Putin to Japan depends on the solution of the question of what kind of agreement will be prepared for the summit, said Tuesday the Russian Ambassador to Japan Yevgeny Afanasyev at the National Press Club in Tokyo. Russian President Vladimir Putin. Archival photo \u00a9 RIA Novosti. Mikhail Klimentyev\nMedia: Japan is considering the question of Putin's visit in July   \"I think the most important question - not when, but what can be done to the visit was a success for both countries,\" - said Afanasiev. According to him, it is important to determine what can be concluded agreements which specific projects can be activated, what documents will be signed as a result of the summit. \"It requires a lot of work on the part of various departments,\" - said Afanasiev. \"I believe that we should concentrate on this work, and the dates of the visit will be determined themselves\", - he said. Russian Ambassador while recalled that the two leaders - President Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe - maintain regular contacts at international forums, is sometimes said by telephone. As Afanasyev, Prime Abe invited Putin to visit Japan, the invitation was accepted in principle the Russian leader, and there is an agreement to carry out his visit to Japan \"in the most appropriate time for both sides.\" Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited Moscow in the spring of 2013. Putin's return visit to Tokyo was scheduled for the autumn of 2014, but did not take place because of the complication of the international situation due to the crisis in Ukraine. Dates of the visit was postponed to 2015, but specific dates have not yet been named. In November at the G20 summit in Antalya hosted a meeting of Putin and Abe.

As demonstrated in events in which Russian fighter jets soared over the Sea of Okhotsk, Putin is asserting Russian dominance over diplomatic malleability and a willingness to negotiate. On Sept 16, a Russian plane was identified as having entered Japanese airspace off the coast of Hokkaido by defense officials, and was shortly intercepted by four Japanese fighter jets. These aggressive displays of military bravado are, according to the former deputy director of future operations for the U.S. Navy\u2019s Fifth Fleet, akin to \u201ca tiger showing its teeth.\u201d   The detainment of 11 Hokkaido-based Japanese fishermen by Russian authorities for operating within Russia\u2019s claimed territorial waters also exemplifies the difficult circumstances that prohibit a swift resolution to the Kuril Islands dispute. While this issue didn\u2019t appear to create much political blowback, similar future incidents could seriously harm relations. More troubling than this is the Russian government\u2019s recent announcement to develop a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in the Russian Far East \u2014 which included the disputed islands. Between 2016 and 2025, Russia plans on attracting foreign investment from China and South Korea with the aim of developing the region economically. The use of Chinese and Korean money would no doubt be viewed suspiciously by Japan.   Perhaps more problematic to Japan than Russia\u2019s increasing military presence in the region, however, is the fact that its ties with China are steadily improving. China\u2019s military rise and posture toward Japan has generated several \u201cconcerns\u201d from the Japanese government. Russia previously sought to limit China from procuring more advanced arms, but within the past year it has changed its stance, agreeing to export its S-400 surface-to-air missile system to the Chinese who will become the first foreign buyer of the advanced system.  \n"], [241, "2015-12-17T13:34:26Z", [0.3], ""], [452, "2015-12-17T13:16:12Z", [0.45], ""], [691, "2015-12-17T13:12:23Z", [0.29], ""], [10666, "2015-12-17T04:18:06Z", [0.28], ""], [12874, "2015-12-16T23:37:01Z", [0.09], ""], [13185, "2015-12-16T22:32:03Z", [0.0], "At the moment Japan is not on Putin's list of countries he is either worried about or wanting to impress.

Abe may visit Russia before Putin visits Japan: Russian official MOSCOW \u2013 Prime Minister Shinzo Abe may end up visiting Russia before President Vladimir Putin ever making his long-awaiting trip to Japan, Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. When Abe and Putin met Sunday in Antalya, Turkey, amid the Group of 20 summit, it became clear that the Russian leader wouldn\u2019t be coming to Tokyo by the end of this year. Russia believes that the difficulty in arranging a Putin visit partly reflects concern by the U.S. government over a closer relationship between Tokyo and Moscow, sources familiar with the matter said. Against this background, Moscow may have shifted its focus to inviting Abe to Russia, instead of working on arranging Putin\u2019s visit to Japan, the sources said. With an Abe visit to Russia, Moscow likely aims to seek Japan\u2019s support in easing economic sanctions by Western countries over the Ukraine crisis, the sources said. On Sunday, Peskov said Putin told Abe during their meeting in Turkey that he wants to meet with Abe at an as-yet unnamed location in Russia. The Abe government has not confirmed whether Putin made that remark. http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/11/17/national/politics-diplomacy/abe-may-visit-russia-before-putin-visits-japan-russian-official/#.VlwGCb_3hKB Japanese PM Abe may visit Russian region before Putin visits Tokyo: Kremlin The Kremlin said on Monday that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe might visit one of Russia's regions before a forthcoming visit by President Vladimir Putin to Japan. Putin met with Abe on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit at the request of Japan, the Kremlin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists. Peskov said that preparatory work was continuing for Putin's visit to Japan - which other Russian officials said would take place in the foreseeable future - but it was probable Abe would visit one of Russia's regions before.

He has worked with the US to repair relations with Korea. He has committed his prestige to a change the Japanese  constitution to allow Japan to project  military force into the East and South China Sea and the contested sholls and islands with the US. He has committed to the TPP.  Abe  needs Obama until 1-21-17 and the US thereafter.  The concept of Face still  means alot in Japanese society. Such a visit would infuriate and humiliate Obama right before a US Presidential election.  It would alienate every prospective Republican adminstration.Obama has negotiated  TPP and co:operated with Japan. US has  helped Japan in everyway  possible  vis a vis North Korea and  China and with expanded trade relations and security co:operation. aky the economic and strategic TPP whch does not include China  The Japanese people are a proud people but are not going   to reward Putin with a state visit before July 1. 2016.   Other than Germany,\nand even there, Putin will be lucky to get a  vote for sanctions lifted over East Ukraine. Other than Merkel, there is no G-7 leader who will reward Putin with a state visit. Even then he would not  be welcome in any G-7 country  unless he came with  deeds not promises.\nAssuming Putin would make concessions he would visit Germany first. Putin is not making concessions. He has no gifts to bring to Japan other than cheap energy .Putin already sold all of its exportable energy and economy to China as part of the Chinese development bank and Silk Road. It makes sense for Japan to continue to have and even attempt to expand its relations with Russia, a neighbor, which still holds the Sakhlalin Islands.

[the] chances for a quick resolution of the conflict [over the disputed Northern territories located in the Sea of Okhotsk] were slim all along, particularly after Russia announced plans to invest in new military and civilian infrastructure projects on the Kuril islands. \". . .  we need to resolve the islands issue first because that is the source of all of the problems we are having now,\u201d stated an unnamed Japanese government official  . . . . \"One of the principle points of disagreement is the scope of any future Russia-Japan negotiations: Russia has repeatedly insisted on decoupling negotiations over a peace treaty from the territorial disputes over the Northern territories, while Japan insists that a peace treaty without resolving the territorial issues is impossible. \"Shinzo Abe and Vladimir Putin are slated to meet again during the G20 summit held in Turkey from November 15-16 and the APEC summit scheduled for November 18-19 in Manila.
