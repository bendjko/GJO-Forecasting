If we apply a 63% growth, we get ~1,887,000. I use this as the high end because China has been lowering subsidies for electric vehicles.  To get into the fourth bucket, we need a growth of just over 45%.  Since, it seems that the reason for the high sales so far could have been a front-loading of demand ahead of subsidy expiration, I am somewhat bearish on sales going forward (and therefore lower the fourth bucket from 20%). On the other hand, China is not completely removing subsidies until 2020 implying that we may see continued front-loading of demand (just less severe) ahead of the disappearance of subsidies. The remainder of the year would have to be only 13% higher than H2 2018 in order to get into the 3rd bucket.
