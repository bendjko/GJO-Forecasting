The reason that I am giving a percentage here as high as 10% is simply because of Trump's showmanship- he is known to love a good plot twist, and theoretically it could be a smart political move to try and sway middle-ground women in favor of the Republican ticket now should it include a woman as Vice President. This may be even more probable since Begala made his claim on March 2, as Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, promised to name a woman as his running mate in a debate with Bernie Sanders on March 15, so Trump could use this as a tactic to match Biden and block him from using the \"female VP\" card to his advantage. However, despite all this, it still seems highly improbable that this will actually happen. For one, current VP Mike Pence is a very \"stable\" candidate, contrary to Trump's colorful personality that many traditional GOP members dislike, and who has already proven himself capable of the position. Additionally, a change in running mate when running for reelection has only been done three times in U.S. history, and the most recent instance was when President Franklin D. Roosevelt ran for an unprecedented third term with a new running mate in 1940. Many Americans, Democrat and Republican alike, agree that Pence has been a very capable leader in his position at the head of the COVID-19 response task force, and he has a strong favorability rating among most Republicans, making him a reliable partner. Even if Trump does decide to dump Pence, there is no guarantee that he would replace him with Haley, or even if Haley would accept the position.

The focus of the administration and its reelection concerns at the moment  is far more focused on ensuring that the economy does not enter a long term recession or face a financial meltdown. Additionally, it will be unclear how the administration will need to increase its support amongst voters until after the Democratic national Convention, anticipated to be in July. The Covid=19 pandemic will likely push this back past. the July 18th timeframe.      This being said, I do believe that Trump will likely drop Pence as his running mate in favor of Nikki Haley. Trump needs to gain the support of middle class, moderate, suburban women voters in order to win reelection in a variety of states. Pence was a strategic running mate in 2016 as he signaled to the evangelical christian voting bloc that it would not be selling out its values by voting for Trump. Now that Trump has (however moderately) advocated for policies that the evangelical community supports, it appears unlikely that the many evangelicals will switch (especially the case if Bernie Sanders, a secular jew, were the democratic candidate). A moderate female republican will signal to moderate suburban female voters that Trump is at least palatable, in a similar way that Pence signaled such to the evangelical community.      Since the DNC is scheduled for 7/13-7/16, if the Covid-19 outbreak mitigates quicker than expected  and a decision on the democratic candidate is made during that time frame, the administration may announce its intention to run with Haley immediately in order to draw media attention toward a new story, accounting for my 10% \"yes\" opinion.

Take into account the turnover (Total 10) in Trump's Cabinet from 2017 - 2019 compared to Reagan - Obama (Average 3.4), Vice President Pence is a member of the Cabinet - 49% = 16.7% * (10/3.4) Likelihood of President Trump deciding to replace Vice President Pence = 49% 3 factors that reportedly led to Pence being chosen Vice President in 2016 were -\n1 - Was a State Governor & former Congressman, knew Washington DC allowing Trump to put him to be in charge of US \"domestic & foreign affairs\" \n2 - Strong links to Republican Voters (Especially Christian Conservative) & Donors which Trump needed in 2016 to prove his Republican credentials given he had never been a Republican before \n3 - He was a Yes Man who wouldn't challenge Trump. In this forecast will assume that the decision to Keep/Remove Pence will be made solely in relation to the 2020 US Presidential Election in increasing Trump's chances for re-election. Keep Pence -\n1 - Changing VP could be seen as a sign of weakness, lose face with voters & donors.\n2 - Is needed in motivating & energizing base, his connections with certain voters & donors aren't replaceable.\n3 - Is a loyalist which Trump reportedly values above all and doesn't challenge him.\n4 - Pence has important roles & positions in the Administration and allies in Republican Party & Administration that will successfully resist his removal. Remove Pence -\n1 - Since 2017 Trump has established his Republican credentials with Republican voters (e.g., typical 90% approval rating) & donors (e.g. Sheldon Adelson), Pence is no longer needed to provide this.\n2 - Unlike in 2016 when Trump faced Hillary Clinton, an unpopular candidate, he will likely face Joe Biden, a popular candidate while Trump has remained divisive & unpopular. Selecting a new, popular Vice President who reaches swing suburb voters who changed from 2016 to vote Democrat in 2018 midterms (Pence I believe doesn't reach them) could increase Trump re-election chances. In other words Trump would energize his rural base with the new VP attracting moderate, swing suburb voters by \"ticket balancing\" leaving Democrats only urban voters in 2020 election. \n3 - That with the Trump takeover of the Republican Party, Pence isn't needed as perhaps was in 2016 in soothing Republican Establishment fears & worries about Trump and if he wants to he can get rid of Pence. On reflecting on all these reasons to Keep/Remove Pence, I am won over by the reasons to Remove Pence if there exists a replacement who I believe would be chosen if are -\n1 - Popular & attracts suburb voters and Trump base.\n2 - Is a Trump loyalist.\n3 - Is a current / former Governor (helps if from a swing state, Pence is from Indiana which is always Republican so isn't an advantage).\n4 - Has Republican Establishment links to soothe concerns on Pence removal. Assuming the decision to replace Pence is made, does Trump choose to replace him with Nikki Haley or Someone Else ? Possible replacements are -\n1 - Nikki Haley (4/4) - Former Governor of South Carolina (won twice), High Favourables, Trump reportedly really likes her, chosen by Republican Party to give State of the Union Address response in 2016.\n2 - Rick Scott (3/4) - would have to give up Florida Senate Seat which was extremely close in 2018. Suspect Republicans want to keep control of Senate second to winning Presidency.\n3 - Scott Walker (2/4) As a woman, 48 year old to Trump's 73 years old, non-white, popular, Trump loyalist Republican, I do believe that Nikki Haley would bring greater electoral advantage for Trump as VP than either Rick Scott or Scott Walker in addressing his unfavourability ratings in the suburbs. Therefore give probability of Trump wanting Haley as new VP = 90%, Someone Else = 10%. Likelihood that Trump will want to remove Pence and ask Haley to be his new Vice President -\n 44% = 49% * 0.9 If asked would Nikki Haley say Yes to being Vice President? I would personally say unlikely e.g. 20%. The Vice Presidency is a potential jumping point for the Presidency in 2024, but on the other-hand she very likely will not want to be directly associated with the Trump Campaign / White House as a VP to avoid future scandals & chaos which may hurt a future presidential bid in 2024. \nReportedly many people are declining prestigious positions such as Defence Secretary and White House Chief of Staff as do not want to be directly connected / involved with Trump. I found this Atlantic & Vox article to be very insightful as to her possible VP thinking - \nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/disavowing-trump-isnt-part-nikki-haleys-long-game/601987/\nhttps://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/10/9/17955654/nikki-haley-resign-news Likelihood of Haley saying Yes to being Vice President -\n9% = 0.2 * 48% If Haley says yes, will it be announced before 18/7/2020 ? The Democratic National Convention is 13 - 16/7/2020, Republican National Convention is 24 - 27/8/2020. Declaring Haley as the new VP during the DNC it reminds me of the before a 2016 Debate where Trump & Bannon organized a conference with Bill Clinton's accusers. By announcing it during the DNC it would take away news coverage away from Democrats with Trump known as a skilled media manipulator/showman. Today's date is 11/3/2020. Its 129 days from 17/7/2020 and 166 days from 23/8/2020 (appears that Vice President nominees are announced before that Party's convention). Likelihood before 18/7/2020 the announcement that Haley will be Trump's 2020 running mate -\n 7% = 129/166 * 9% While a very intriguing idea, and certainly makes a lot of sense from the Trump's campaigns perspective, I do believe that Nikki Halley is entirely focused on the 2024 Presidential Election and wants to spend the next 4 years planning & organizing her Presidential campaign and stay away from the partisanship in Washington -\nhttps://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/latest-nikki-haley-fundraising-event-sure-to-fuel-2024-speculation"], [28153, "2020-03-11T14:52:14Z", [0.18], ""], [86077, "2020-03-11T14:37:04Z", [0.1], "Trump has been known to throw his closest allies under the bus at his convenience but I think Pence is still popular among evangelicals."], [691, "2020-03-11T14:15:15Z", [0.12], ""], [84791, "2020-03-11T13:41:01Z", [0.06], ""], [11465, "2020-03-11T13:00:37Z", [0.13], ""], [2965, "2020-03-11T11:53:09Z", [0.0], "Mattis-Haley in 2024\nAll the Kings Horses and all the Kings Men\nCouldn't Keep Humpty Dumpty from......\nNot Russian interference plus Stein 2%\nNot social media Trump plus 2%\nNo Comey emails disclosures -2% twice for violatng DOJ Guidelines See IG Report\nthrow in Haley now worth 0 percent\nDemographics is Destiny Its like King Canute ordering the the tides to recede\nForecast An enormous blue wave of 60% Democratic in every state.\nThis was forecast for 2016 but  the above made me wrong on\nwho will be President 2016 Clinton 100% wrong\nI bid it at 70% Clinton/30 Trump after Comey 2x on the hypermarket predictif\nNow I bid 95% that with Biden the nominee, Trumps worst fear loss of Upper Midwest and South materializes.

He is losing this traditional constituency by about 2 to 1.   I suspect Trump  realizes this could cost him the election.   To that end, I understand per a David Plouffe MSNBC interview that it is an awfully lot easier to get back a constituency than acquire a new one.    Nikki Haley was popular with both parties when she left the UN.  (See poll below.)  She is sort of the Republican's Michelle Obama. Therefore, Haley could help Trump a lot in regaining the Republican woman's vote and capture some Democrat votes.   She is also a woman of color who might bring back a few Republican leaning Latinos and Asians. Pence adds little to the Trump ticket.  In fact, I suspect they appeal to exactly the same Republican voters so I doubt there is not one swing voter in America who will switch from Biden (the most likely Democratic nominee) to Trump because Pence is on the ticket.  Of course, loyalty is very important to Trump.  He demands it.  But it is a one way street.  He will fire his most loyal staff members  the instant he concludes they are no longer useful to him or it was otherwise in his interest.  The examples are too many to mention, and if the reader cannot think of one, there is probably no hope for that reader.  The probability of Trump asking Haley to join the ticket rises as Trump's popularity declines during the coronavirus pandemic and resulting economy decline.  The only reason I can think of for Trump not to ask Haley to join the ticket Haley would become the most likely presidential nominee for 2020.  I suspect Trump wants one of his children, almost certainly Ivanka, to succeed him.  However, that is a possible problem down the road; Trump has a real problem right now.   But why would Nikki Haley accept such an offer?  VP nominees tend to disappear rather quickly from the political spotlight when the ticket loses.  No one remembers the running mates after a few years.  Gore's VP candidate, Joe Lieberman even lost the Democratic nomination for his own senate seat in 2006, which he had held for 18 years.   Sarah Palin was a flash in the public spotlight for a little while, but she too disappeared.    On the other hand, a lot of Vice presidents are elected-- or reelected-- president, e.g., George H. W. Bush, Richard Nixon, Lyndon Johnson, Harry Truman (and even Al Gore won the popular vote.)   Yet, Haley is currently popular across the political spectrum while Trump is easily the most polarizing president in my lifetime--and probably in history.  All presidents are somewhat polarizing, but Trump is different.  There are a number of former Republicans pulling for Biden because they hate Trump so much.  This did not happen in large numbers with any other president, even Nixon.   Some commentators claim the only reason Trump has a >90 percent approval rating with his base is because so many Republicans have left the party.  (I did not verify this but it rings at least somewhat true.) Hence, I am not sure Nikki Haley would get the boost in a future presidential election, e.g., 2024, that other vice presidents received.  Haley might see her chances of becoming president diminish by accepting such a nomination.  As Trump's star fades so does the probability of Nikki Haley accepting any such offer.    Yet, I understand the white house-itis is very contagious to any one in reach, and Trump as president and dictator of the Republican party could offer to help her in other ways, e.g., all but guarantee her the 2024 presidential nomination.  (But, if she is smart, she will know he will not keep such a promise.) The mid-July deadline is an issue. The Republican National Convention is set for August 24 - August 27.  Therefore, Haley must accept such an offer no later than the last day of the convention.  Replacing a party nominated VP Pence  would be much more difficult at that point, if even possible.  The primaries end on June 7.  The Democratic convention runs from July 13 to 16.   I think Trump would make the announcement at the end of  the primaries at the earliest.  Therefore, any announcement would occur between June 7 and August 27.  Trump might want to wait until after July 16 to see who the democrats nominated, or  Trump might want to make the announcement during the democratic convention to take the spotlight away.   I think there would be a benefit to announcing earlier because it would create a \"bounce\" in the polls, and the early announcement might give the pro-Haley enthusiasm a chance \"to set\" with the voters. \n\nTherefore, 85 percent chance of Trump asking or desiring Haley to replace Pence. (He might not ask if he is sure she will not accept.)   Nikki has a 60 percent chance of accepting.  However, the deadline of over a month prior to the convention so a 75 percent chance of making the appointment during this period.  (.85 x .6 x .75= 38 percent) Yet, I don't know why but my gut feeling is that this is much more likely to happen than 38 percent.  Of course, if Haley refuses an offer, It will not be made public until after the election. https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2538"], [86053, "2020-03-10T03:47:47Z", [0.04], "Pence has served satisfactorily (to Trump)."], [31275, "2020-03-10T03:46:31Z", [0.24], "I will start even lower.
