On the other hand as well as gaining independence from Westminster I think one of Sturgeon's main aims is to retain Scotland's place in the EU, and after the transition period finishes that will become more difficult by an order of magnitude. An independent Scotland would be nowhere near to meeting EU financial rules for new applicants and it would be very hard for the EU to bend those rules after the end of the brexit transition period.

However, setting a date in advance of the election is also a danger. If the election doesn't go so well it could prove a promise difficult to keep. Events could also cause the chosen date to become unhelpful. Keeping a more vague date (\"in 2021\" or \"by the end of 2022\") would be much safer politically while still promising a time period. Therefore I think it unlikely a date will be named by the Scottish government or the SNP. If a government supporting independence is in power after the election, then late May 2022 seems the best choice - but that isn't the question here. There could also be a referendum in 2020, not sanctioned by the UK government. This seems unlikely (but if the SNP won the election in 2021 and the UK government again refused a referendum then it would be more likely).

I decided to apply Bayesian statistics to my initial speculation. I initially believed that while the Scottish wanted independence, the British would never allow them to hold a referendum. However, recent articles seem to suggest that maybe Scots aren't as gung-ho on another referendum as I thought. While a slim majority are now in favor of independence, there is a reasonable amount of people who feel that now is not the time for such a vote (https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/13/save-uk-scotland-independence-unionists). Furthermore, there is evidence that Scotland would be unable to even join the EU, the main point for this new referendum, because of its current economy (https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1242393/snp-nicola-sturgeon-scottish-independence-currency-euro-pound-sterling-scotland-news). I decided to use Bayesian analysis to update my belief on whether Scots wanted the referendum, and use that accordingly to update my probability that a referendum would happen. To find out the Probability that a Scottish Referendum will be held with British permission, I multiplied the probability of the Brits allowing a referendum if it was likely that the Scots would vote for independence (which was my initial assumption) (.02)  with the likelihood that the Scots would want a referendum (I originally had this higher but given recent doubts I will but this at .6) and divide it by the probability that the British would ever allow a referendum before 2021 even under the best circumstances (I am putting this at .2 since Britain has had a lot of referendums lately and I doubt that the reigning government want to set up yet another vote so soon. As a result, the Bayesian equation I have set up is (.02*.6)/.2 which equals .06 or a 6% chance. This is my new answer.

This means that unless Johnson changes his mind, we are not going to see a Scottish referendum anytime soon. I believe that the likelihood of Johnson allowing an independence referendum to take place is very low. Ironically, the reason why I believe this is the same reason why independence sentiment has grown once more in Scotland: Brexit. On January 31, the day that the withdrawal agreement was put into force, Johnson's speech was not a gloaty one like Nigel Farage, but one that emphasized the need to unite (https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/boris-johnson-brexit-eu-britain-a4350696.html). A referendum would only further divide the nation, regardless of whether or not the Scottish independence movement was successful (as this is a different question entirely). In fact, it's possible that the Scottish drive for independence has actually DECREASED the likelihood of a referendum if anything. The last referendum saw Scotland remain by a narrow vote of 55%. This was before Brexit, during which Scotland voted 62% to remain (https://www.bbc.com/news/politics/eu_referendum/results). Voters turned this disdain into action in 2019 when Tories lost many seats in the north to the SNP despite doing well in other places (https://www.bbc.com/news/election/2019/results). The previous narrow margin, added with the increased tensions of Brexit and recent election data, indicates that Scotland would likely leave if given another opportunity to vote.

Generally speaking, rising nationalism has been characterized by right-wing ideals that seek to maintain the status quo or to enhance domestic/sovereign power. But in Scotland's case, the Scottish National Party has continually pushed for greater flexibility in setting its own energy policy and seeks to position itself as the beacon to the rest of the world on climate change policy. This push is occurring in conjunction with a younger, more progressive voting base who seeks to leverage its own green energy production in the North Sea to bolster its economy in the face of dwindling oil reserves.

As the UK implements cutbacks on funding for green energy proposals it seems unlikely that the policies of the UK government will find common ground with the more progressive, green energy-focused Scotland government.  I do leave a large amount of uncertainty (30%) due to the length of time it would take any government to make this kind of decision at all. Combine this with the fact that 2/3 of the Scottish people had voted in 2016 (leaving roughly 33% of its population voting against) in favor of EU membership. There is an incredible amount of uncertainty regarding the political and economic stability in the UK, but despite my concerns it still seems as though Scotland and the UK no longer see eye-to-eye on future trajectories and will likely translate into Scotland breaking away from the UK before 1 January, 2021.

Johnson will do whatever he can to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK. It would be a catastrophe for his political standing.  I would not be surprised if Sturgeon threatened to call a referendum, but I doubt she would actually pull the trigger before the Scottish elections.  The question says that whether the UK government agrees to the date is immaterial to the question. It is not entirely clear whether the 'UK government' would also mean the Supreme Court. If the Supreme Court  ruled against the proposed referendum, would that still count as a date having been set?  I am going to take the question as meaning 'will the SNP name a date on which they propose to hold a referendum'. I think there is a possibility that they will. For example they might say, 'if we win a mandate in the 2021 election, then we will organise a referendum before the end of the year.

In the span of 2 years, the political differences between the nations became more clear. The leading SNP (Scottish National Party) described the vote as a \u201cmaterial change in circumstances.\u201d  Within the last week FM Sturgeon presented her request for a new independence referendum to Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The request was denied by PM Johnson, stating the 2014 vote was a \u201conce in a lifetime\u201d vote, and a new vote would lead to \u201cpolitical stagnation.\u201d Though public support for independence grows among citizens, it has yet to reach a majority. Despite SNP support for the vote, several party members are doubtful it will occur this year. Without PM Johnson\u2019s approval to transfer powers to Scottish Parliament, FM Sturgeon has not ruled out the option of taking the matter to court. If legal actions be the case, the process is timely, and would likely not produce results within the next year. The nation must also consider, by the time a decision to leave could be made, the UK will have exited the EU, meaning Scotland would need to execute the arduous process of reapplying for EU membership.  Though the SNP holds a strong majority, I predict by only 10% that a new referendum date will be set by January 1, 2021. Even with SNP support, many party members are not confident it will occur within the next year. Past independence votes have not been successful, with the most recent referendum taking place only 5 years ago. The United Kingdom is scheduled to leave the EU by late 2020, which means Scotland would leave with it, and have to reapply for EU membership. The idea of this process could dissuade public opinion from supporting a new referendum, regardless of the nation\u2019s majority vote to remain in the EU. Lastly, FM Sturgeon does not have the support of UK Prime Minister Johnson, which is a critical piece of initiating the process. Though I believe the conversation will persist, I do not believe a date will be available before January 1, 2021.

The body that would set a date would be the Scottish Parliament. But according to the current legal settlement the Scottish Parliament could only do that with the agreement of the UK Government. So if the Scottish Government set a date for a referendum on Scotland's status without the agreement of the UK Government it would be acting illegally.   The SNP has the largest number of seats in the Scottish Parliament (62) but does not have a majority (of the 129 seats). Only the SNP is in favour of changing Scotland's status within the UK. No election to the Scottish Parliament is due to be held until May 2021. So in order to have a majority the Scottish Parliament would need to be dissolved and new elections would need to be held, and the SNP would need to gain a majority of seats. This seems very unlikely to happen in the next year (say a 5% chance). If somehow the SNP have a majority they would either need to get the UK Government to agree to a referendum or act illegally to decide to hold one and set a date. The SNP has (so far) been clear that it sees the chaos that has been caused by Catalonia holding an illegal referendum on independence from Spain (politicians being fined and/or sent to jail) that it does not want to go down that route. An illegal referendum would also risk upsetting the EU when if Scotland became independent from the UK one of its objectives would be to re-join the EU. For fairly obvious reasons the EU does not want the practice of holding illegal independence referendums spreading to would be break away regions to other EU countries. So I think we can totally discount Scotland setting a date for an illegal referendum. Its also likely that strategically the SNP would do better to see the effects of Brexit over the next couple of years. It would be logical to see businesses contract when the UK fully leaves the EU Single Market and Customs Union, before they can expand to take advantage of the opportunities of not being constrained by being in the EU. In short the UK and Scottish economy will take any Brexit hit before it gets any benefit. So the best time for an independence referendum would be at the bottom of this economic dip.  I assume that the UK Government is aware that its likely to get worse before it gets better and if it offered Scotland another referendum having it after the dip would be better. The UK PM has already ruled out another Scottish referendum in the foreseeable future. I see no likelihood that he changes his mind in the next few months. As the majority of Scottish voters do not want to leave the EU trying to get an independence referendum out of the way before a Brexit slump hits would be a big risk for the UK Government as Scottish voters might see voting for independence as a last chance to avoid Sexit (Scottish exit of the EU).    The question does not actually refer to Scottish independence, so in theory a referendum on a different change to Scotland's status comes be asked. I am not aware of any ideas apart from independence  being suggested to change Scotland's status. Obviously some other idea could come up in the next year (e.g. changing the UK into a union of federal states) but going from a small idea to setting a date for a referendum seems very unlikely."], [82435, "2020-01-19T18:30:51Z", [0.6], "The Scots have done it before but right now with the mess in the UK they may just think they have a chance at succession.
