The departure of US troops would also give the Taliban much greater bargaining power with the Afghan government.  This makes sense to me.  Right now there is a stalemate that the Taliban might be able to end if the US leaves.    Trump's only concern is the 2020 election.  A peace deal would make it appear that his foreign policy is more than a joke, which is the perception right now.  He could argue that he finally was victorious in the war W Bush and Obama could not end.  Trump, Fox and One America news will all portray any agreement as the greatest victory in the history of the world.   If Trump is smart and completely ruthless (which he is as a sociopath), some troops will leave immediately upon signing the agreement.  The rest will leave after the November election.  The immediate departure of some troops would publicly indicate a change prior to the election.  The delayed departure of the remainin troops would give the Taliban an incentive to keep the peace until the election.

In particular, the Taliban will have to reduce violence to a significant extent as part of the aforementioned seven-day \"reduction in violence\" period.

There is far too much posturing within Afghanistan itself, tribal, religious, then all the active hostile intelligence services who want their outcome to happen, which is to void a peace deal and make ISAF bleed. Therefore, being too weak to invade Iran.  War on two front... The US is seen as being weakened by Iran, Russia, and China's threats.  The Afghan leaders will ask \"what would making an agreement with a weakened player achieve?\"     How do the players in Afghan stack up?  Who's money are they taking now?  How transient are their loyalties?  Come on, let us look at facts, unless you conduct total warfare you are weak, the west is weak and in decline as a military power.  The Taliban conduct total warfare, and you have to respect that. In fact, Islam conducts total warfare, social, economic, financial, political and in ways we are yet to see. Brilliant, Islamic tactics are the best I have read, seen, and so effective without firing a shot.  The Eu is a Nazi lead mess, NATO is a joke, Iran is influential in Afghan, and \"war is deceit\" said Mohammed.  The Islamic people know they will take over the west in fifty years so they will keep on fighting. As the west is already lost.   The hidden hand of the Saudi's, Chinese, Russian security services are in full effect.  The west is penetrated by all hostile intelligence services, much in the same way Afghan is. Just the west is too blood stupid to see it. That is why Islamic extremists have won the war in Europe already.   The countries change, only the billionaire players stay the same.  Only a few American banking families have made money from all the death.  Iran trains, supplies, weapons to the Taliban. The billionaires don't care about what religion wins, they make the money regardless.  Iran will be making deals with Afghanistan, as will the Pakistani ISI, the CIA will know all of this already.  Foreign policy needs to be dictated by the US, but they are too bloody arrogant to figure out they aren't the only players with layer cake agendas.  The Islamic agenda of war is global, timeless. they have been working on this for 1450 years. the policy-making fools in Washington can't yet see the west has lost the west insurgency and they, the Islamists know this.  Thanks to the UN, Tony Blair and the socialist agenda in the west. Taking oil blood money instead of looking after the people.  Then there is the global supply of drugs that are an influence.  Too many factors affecting multilayered religious fanatics who have beaten the US, UK and the rest of the west.  They must be laughing at us all.   No country has ever survived an insurgency, and yet the west has an active Islamic insurgency taking place, and this is known all over the Islamic world.  Again, what benefit to the Taliban is this agreement? None.  The yanks are cowards, too scared to do what is needed in war.  Total war or don't bother starting one.  Iran about to teach you this.  The ISAF actions are seen as locally, and internationally weak, with no outcomes, no strategy other than corporations making some cash from stealing as much yellow cake as possible.  The US is known as a financial bully, a coward that runs away when it gets tough, Vietnam is a prime example.  The US has no balls, lead by bankers, paid for by the blood ordinary people.  The US policy is a joke. The US must be on collective crack to think the Taliban will sign any agreement.  The Tali know this, and why on earth should they sign an agreement when they have already won?  The ISAF forces could have ended this war in days, yet they, the money men wanted a protracted war so that they could get richer. These money men, they will already be making deals with the key players to start up more fighting so that ISAF uses more ammunition, that the taxpayers pay for.  Then the money men get richer. So there is absolutely no reason for the Taliban, Haqqani or anyone to sign a peace deal.  A cowardly deal being pushed by a cowardly military who have lost a war and just want to get out.  Obama, the creator of ISIS, Muslim Brotherhood, lauded by the leftwing press, undermined the war effort to the benefit of the enemy. He gave Iran money, opened terrorist training camps in the USA, 72 of them I am told.  See, the Taliban have not only won the war in Afghanistan but also caused the western culture to be murdered with open arms thanks to our own politicians who sold us out.  Tell me why religious fanatics should sign any deal that isn't clearly giving them what they want?  "], [82212, "2020-01-19T16:59:14Z", [0.85], "US presidential elections.

Negotiations over the U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam could be considered as a parallel, and that agreement was reached within a few months of President Nixon's reelection on a promise of \"peace with honor\". That said, the political focus on Vietnam within the U.S. electorate was quite different, so perhaps it's not a helpful analogy. This question closes the day the DNC opens, doesn't indicate that the peace agreement needs to be durable, and doesn't preclude separation from a follow-on round of even more contentious talks among Afghan parties, so it's hard for me not to look at this question from the perspective of the U.S. election cycle and the U.S. President's promise to end the U.S. commitment in Afghanistan. While I'm generally skeptical of the prospects given 9 years of failed negotiations, the potential for a political decision to agree to terms similar to those already agreed upon in 2019, even without changed facts on the ground, bumps up my estimate, along with recent reporting that the Taliban have offered a partial stand-down as part of a dialogue with the U.S. that renewed in early December."], [75863, "2020-01-17T03:22:45Z", [0.33], ""], [75863, "2020-01-16T23:32:38Z", [0.45], ""], [75863, "2020-01-16T23:32:17Z", [0.55], ""], [172, "2020-01-16T21:40:48Z", [0.35], "Taliban proposed a 7-10 day ceasefire in hopes of kickstarting talks.

An electoral loss for Trump would see Democrats in place and protracted US withdrawal which is against Taliban's interests.

The number of interdependent issues even made headlines in 2009/2010 with GEN McChrystal's complexity diagram.  Though the diagram was derided by many it only scratches the surface of the competing interests and overlapping allegiances of the people, politics, religion, and economy of the county.   The question of a peace agreement is one of time and interest.  President Trump has said it is in the U.S. interest to end the war and bring Soldiers home (probably before a November 2020 election).  The Taliban believes it is in its interest to end the war with the U.S. and end 'foreign occupation' of Afghanistan.  These two circles have a great deal of potential overlap, but the divergent element is the elected government of Afghanistan.  The 2019 elections had poor turnout and the current President Ashraf Ghani was identified as the preliminary winner, but this result was challenged by his chief rival.  The situation is similar to the last election which required the U.S. to negotiate a power sharing agreement between the two.  Though nominally sharing power over this term, the government has been ineffective in many area.  A weak mandate among only a portion of the population has not set the government up for success.   The Taliban almost certainly sees this as a positive outcome, but could approach it two ways: continue to refuse meeting with an 'illegitimate' Afghan government, seek to meet and dominate a weak government.  Past behavior would indicate the first option.  Though the U.S. resumed negotiations with the Taliban after the elections - almost certainly with some understanding of the outcome - there doesn't seem to be an indication of how the U.S. will reconcile the status of the Afghan government in a Peace Agreement with the Taliban.  The spectre of history and the U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam would loom large if a decision was made to fully depart (a Taliban requirement) without an agreement on government's status.   The second factor is time - While winter has been a time of reduced violence in the past (environmental factors contributing), spring is a time for poppy harvest and the initiation of new offensives.  To be effective an agreement would need to be achieved prior the winter thaw and the conflict which inevitably occurs around the nesh.  The poppy harvest in Afghanistan is a multi-billion dollar event.  Whether the violence is between drug producers-transporters-protectors-government or some combination thereof, the increased level of violence would be a disruptive element in negotiations.  Traditionally, the talk of peace is normally at its height in the winter, but fades as the potential profit from the poppies grows to maturity and Taliban elements gain access to more money.  In 2020, a central government with a weak mandate may only encourage the Taliban to seek a military victory even more.     While possible - a fully concluded peace agreement is unlikely.

From my first impression, I've had assumed that a US withdrawal with a peace agreement - no matter the details - would be seen more favorable by the US government than a withdrawal without a peace agreement which would not only inofficially but also officially show US defeat in Afghanistan. However, statements by Defense Secretary Esper let me conclude that a peace agreement may not be necessary to withdraw US troops at all [1, 4]. This may be a political move to avoid the impression that the Taliban just have to wait until the next election to get an agreement by the US - how shallow it may be. On the other hand, the incentive to remove all troops may not even be given in the case that it is seen as more costly politically [2, 3, 5]. Therefore, a lot depends on the Taliban's approach to the negotiations. At the moment I assume the status quo to be more probable. This may change if the political costs to stay in Afghanistan outweigh any possible shallow peace agreement.

The public is beyond the point of wanting out.   The critical factors preventing our leaving seems to be a fear that the civil war will continue and there is no guarantee the Taliban areas--despite what they say--will really be free of terrorist plotters.    The critical factors in favor of a treaty are Trump's desire for a foreign policy win (which he seems incapable of) and his lack of fear of abandoning our allies, (e.g., the  Kurds.)   Trump however needs to sign an agreement that will not embarrass him.   The problem of Taliban factionalism is real, but the Taliban has fought--and died--for 16 years.
