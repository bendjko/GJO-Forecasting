One stated threshold they're looking at is 400 hospital admissions/day in London. See https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1371608 I suspect they're looking at London because London cases rose first; London is a microcosm for what will soon happen in the rest of England. If hospital admissions rise too high there, then they will rise too high everywhere in England. There were 386 hospital admissions for Omicron on Dec 22: https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/healthcare?areaType=nhsRegion%26areaName=London So I would expect that the 400 threshold was probably reached on Dec 23. One additional concern, when it comes to overwhelming the NHS, is staffing. As @TJA points out, even as hospitalizations are rising, hospital staff are out having to isolate. Covid cases and exposures among staff will restrict NHS capacity when it is needed most. I also see several factors pushing down the chance that restrictions will be imposed in England. One is that cases may have peaked in London already; if cases will peak everywhere in England soon, the powers that be might conclude that the country can muddle through. Second, Parliament will have to be recalled and haggled with to impose restrictions, and that's a pain for the man who never brushes his hair. Third, it appears that hospitalization durations may be a bit shorter with Omicron. I'm sure they are monitoring many parameters beyond admissions data, including the number of beds available and staffed, etc. I don't think this is a done deal, but with hospitalizations on Dec 22 rising to just under their stated threshold for greater restrictions, I suspect that the chance that restrictions will be imposed is now fairly large. @Anneinak Later edit: There are just too many variables here! I just scrolled down here: https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/healthcare?areaType=nhsRegion%26areaName=London Hospital census data (\"Patients in hospital\" and \"Patients in mechanical ventilation beds\") are low compared to last winter so far. The 7-day average number of patients in hospital on Dec 24 was 2260, compared to last year's figure of 3908 on the same date; the numbers today are at 58% percent of last year's on the same date.  However, I really don't think that Omicron cases have peaked in London. Take a look at London cases (\"Daily Cases by date of specimen\") here: https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/coronavirus--covid-19--cases\nI suspect that what some people have been calling a peak in cases was actually due to a fluctuation with the day of the week. Cases have not been fully processed for recent days but so far are at levels at least as high as those of last week. To me, it looks like case growth is slowing but has likely not yet peaked. With the holidays coming up, we probably won't know until well into the first week of January where the peak actually is. In fact, cases may well not peak until early January. So, with a much higher peak in cases than ever before and a much more rapid rise in cases, despite a bit of a reduction in the risk of hospitalization (on the order of 40%, including effects from existing immunity), I do think they're facing a substantial risk of the NHS having rapidly growing hospitalized populations to levels that are crushing for the NHS, and that's ultimately what I think they're trying to prevent. So, the overall picture I see when I look at case growth, daily hospital admissions, hospital stay duration, and staffing issues - the science side of things - is a situation that points to increasing restrictions asap. The political side does not completely point in that direction, though.

If London admissions remain below 400, it could mean no legally enforced restrictions are needed after Christmas, although there could be tougher guidance announced by the Prime Minister on 27 December. Hospital admissions in London are not the only metric being used to assess the severity of Omicron, but is a key measure. Separately, the UK Health Security Agency will produce early data on severity, analysing vaccination status and age of people admitted to hospital with the Omicron variant, which is also expected before Christmas Eve. However the situation is still fluid, and ministers stress that all options remain in reserve if hospitals come under serious pressure over the New Year.\"\n\"But some boroughs are continuing to show the highest case rates of the pandemic for younger age groups, with one in 16 people aged 25 to 29 testing positive in the week to 16 December\" [and younger adults are less likely to be hospitalized.] London hospital admissions: https://twitter.com/OYCar/status/1473369148361035776\nThere were ~240 admissions on the most recent date for which data are available.

But London cases may have peaked. Is it a real peak, or is it just that people are testing less around the holidays? Hard to say, but I suspect London is at or near its peak in Omicron cases. But, cases may rise again after Christmas. Given that recent peak spread was dominated by younger adults, it doesn't seem likely to me that hospital admissions will increase from 240/day to 400/day over the next few days. That's not the only criterion being considered, apparently, but it's a big one.

We could also look at the Chancellors flash announcement of another COVID aid package to businesses [1] as a softener to what they know is about to be a new years blow to hospitality and the subsequent impact on housing, retail etc. in Jan 2022 (i.e. a pre-emptive indicator).

Its also fair to say that demographic evidence appears to indicate severity and hospitalisation not mapped to the rate of infection [2].  The major severity impact therefore will more focus on the number of people out of work and quarantining (hence the announcement today regarding reducing isolation time (after a NEGATIVE TEST) from 10 days to 7 [3] as a means of mitigating this pressure on the economy and the UK's 'working system'). Economics driving this decision making rather than hospitalisations and fatalities (as these are not the driving concern with the Omicron spread at this time: a data supported political position it appears) with the UK Gov seeming unperturbed at the less quantifiable possibility of incubating a vaccine resistant strain amongst their population (certainly less perturbed than some EU countries [4]).

The threat of rebellion by libertarian / bought and paid for Tories looms large but this \"UK Freedom Caucus\" does not have the blind, unthinking public support that their US counterparts appear to enjoy and the necessary measures will pass with Labour vote anyway. Still hard to say with full certainty, but remembering that Johnson would always prefer to do nothing if he possibly could, it appears that these warnings and daily escalations in severity messaging are ones he'd rather not have to give if he had any other choice (his natural inclination is to ignore, carry on and lie until these are no longer viable options).

This may in turn place pressure on the Government to act now to preserve some reputational competency in 2022 (that may see some opening moves by ascendant Tories to topple the Clown Prince and send him packing with all the blame for the UK's recent travails)."], [102302, "2021-12-01T10:30:57Z", [0.3], ""], [81456, "2021-12-01T07:29:55Z", [0.07], ""], [94872, "2021-12-01T03:39:35Z", [0.2], ""], [96828, "2021-12-01T03:11:13Z", [0.23], "Down a few percentage points due to reports that the those with Omicron have ' very mild' symptoms and @cdob63's point that this is largely a political question as much as it is a \"what's best for public health?\" question."], [92079, "2021-12-01T01:00:47Z", [0.0], ""], [84956, "2021-11-30T23:16:13Z", [0.05], ""], [101031, "2021-11-30T21:55:44Z", [0.08], "Not increasing my forecast a whole lot just yet. \nI have broken the forecast down to a number of sections in my mind:\n1. when will cases increase to a point that new, more stringent public health measures will be required.

The two most recent upwards curves, in July and August, petered out and came back down a bit. It'd be a bit silly to assume that *every time* it goes above 1,200 hospitalisations we lock down, or that exactly 50% of upwards curves drop down. And the situation is very different now, with much greater immunity, than last year.

I'm going to naively call that a base rate of 40%. We're spending more time indoors as the winter draws in. But boosters and continuing natural infection will continue to make it harder for the disease to spread quickly as we go along. Also, if things get worse, there are lots of lighter-touch things that can be imposed, and people naturally regulate their behaviour. And that 40% naive base rate is looking at the whole of the last 20 months, but the nice predictable upwards exponentials were both last year and the wobbly lines were both this year.

Plan B (see ref 1) does not mention it (that I can spot, please correct me if I\u2019ve missed it).

As the data shows, with vaccine proliferation being the significant difference between previous COVID surges and what we may see in Q4 2021, a rise in case numbers does not directly translate to a critical rise in fatalities or hospitalisations. The trend lines are rising in a much shallower trajectory than pre-vaccine surges and the total numbers remain significantly lower. But deaths and hospitalisations ARE still rising, steadily and consistently, and the UK government seem intent on maintaining the political narrative of \"everything back to normal\" for as long as they possibly can (meaning logically that this upward trend will only continue into winter). This of course does not factor in the less predictable (but entirely feasible) impact of any new or emergent variant that bucks the delta variant's current impact on case rates, hospitalisations and deaths. Will the \"slow and steady\" impact of COVID in Q4 2021 (compared to the shock of the previous year's surge), combined with a tacit (and likely unconscious) acceptance of increased COVID morbidity within the UK public, assisted by plenty of \"look the other way\" headlines from the Government and business friendly UK media, be enough to save the Boris premiership from being forced into yet another embarrassing and reactive U turn? Will they be able to keep control of the the virus and (far more important to the UK's populist PM) the public mood in the face of what may (gradually) become an unacceptable daily fatality rate (for perspective: the UK is, as of today's figures, essentially experiencing just short of two Grenfell Towers [3] a day in COVID fatalities) and/or the imminent or actual collapse of the NHS? Today's Sunday paper headlines give further warnings from the UK Government of re-imposed restrictions \"if people don't act responsibly\". As stated in previous rationales (https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1331699) this narrative has been seen in previous surges as the UK Government laying the groundwork for a shifting of the blame away from them (and commonly onto a selected non-Tory voting demographic) as and when new, entirely reactive COVID mitigation measures (or more accurately NHS collapse avoidance measures) are imposed despite their preparatory narrative that \"Boris really doesn't want to\". Recent precedent suggests a \"personal responsibility\" plea to the often contrary, ambivalent and apathetic UK public (trying to ignore the irony of this message coming from the most reckless, irresponsible, incompetent and self-interested UK government in a generation) will very likely fall on deaf ears, leading to the logical conclusion that the things Boris is saying he really doesn't want to do (but will if he's forced to) are more likely than not to come to pass.  Add to this the UK Government's own published concerns about the compound impact of a potentially aggressive Flu and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) [4] epidemic for the 2021 winter season in the UK and what it could do to NHS capacity alongside COVID 19.  Don't forget, this question is asking about lockdown measures being imposed across parts or all of the UK for any reason (not just purely because of COVID). If the UK Government were confident of a managed and controllable infection & fatality rate at this moment, would they be giving preparatory warnings (and preparing blame narratives) ahead of a potential new surge and high healthcare stress period for the winter period? If they were confident in vaccine performance, current COVID mitigations and NHS preparedness for the winter season wouldn't this populist and headline focused Government be be busy telling everyone NOT to worry and start making Christmas plans? Looking at the list of measures available: localised restrictions on numbers in pubs & restaurants, indoor gatherings and social events as a mitigation measure ahead of a more widespread regional lockdown appears very much to be on the cards (and would seem to count for this question save for residential care homes which the GJP have confirmed count as medical care facilities and therefore out of bounds for this question). Finally, and on a (not incredible) tangent, would the imposition of some restrictions on certain social gatherings (particularly around the Christmas period) be a useful cover for some of the Brexit (and COVID) induced supply shortages being increasingly felt by the UK at this moment? COVID has proven to be a very useful scapegoat for some of the UK's Brexit induced travails right now and we've seen the UK Government and its friendly media outlets playing this line hard to avoid the PM's pet project being revealed as the economically disastrous clown show it might otherwise be proven to be. Whilst this might seem a rather extreme and Machiavellian move there have already been reports of beer shortages due to Brexit induced driver shortages [5] and these are only likely to get worse as the driver shortage exacerbates and the holiday season kicks in in earnest with no restrictions on pub and bar gathering. Whilst painful, might the Brexit committed UK Government also look upon restrictions on bars, pubs and social gatherings over Christmas '21 (and the resultant relief from demand upon the supply chain) as something of a Brexit silver lining? This doesn't feel at all impossible with the current lot, although its also a hypothesis I'm not putting any real forecasting value into for this question! If they put restrictions in within this question's timeframe it'll be because they have been forced to by the conditions of the moment and not purely because they hope to use restrictions over Christmas to help mask Brexit's lengthening skid marks. The political cost vs benefit calculation wouldn't seem to add up if that was their driving intention behind re-imposed social restrictions.

We\u2019ve seen this sort of performative \"trial and measure headline\" a lot over the last year or so: a narrative story that starts with \u201che really doesn\u2019t want to\u2026\u201d which gradually morphs into \u201che may have no choice but to\u2026\u201d which, shortly after the point of inevitability (and way too late to manage proactively) becomes \u201cfellow citizens, it is with regret that I must\u2026\u201d.  Combined with the spin of \"this or that (generally non-Tory supporting) demographic are to blame for this\" then what we see today may be a useful herald of things to come in October / November for the UK. NI tax hike shows BJ is willing to do the unpopular things so long as he keeps hold of his majority parliamentary support.  Whilst I remain of the view that a national lockdown is far less likely, the possibility of local lockdowns in the face of regional healthcare being overwhelmed (likely in the woefully underfunded North of England where outbreaks have been significantly serious to require controversial regional lockdowns) seems significantly more likely today with Boris seeming to lay the groundwork and \u2018soften the landing\u2019 of future restrictions with preparatory public warnings. In counterpoint, the vaccine rollout in the UK has undeniably gone well in its initial drive although it does appear to be tailing off now as those that will have and those that can't or won't haven't.  Not as much talk of anti-vaxxer communities and sub-cultures in the UK but they will inevitably be present in some form.  More likely are the younger demographics who have not yet been able to get vaccinated and are also now returning to collective education with few restrictions or mitigations required by government (but still present at a local level). There is also the desire from within Boris' camp to maintain some of his crumbling support in the \"red wall\" areas: something that may encourage him to shy away from widespread social gathering restrictions whatever the situation in Northern healthcare maybe. The requirement to lock down will be unpopular within Boris' MP base and so will require unequivocal data and an undeniable catastrophe to become apparent before he will resort to it, but when exploring what is in place right now to prevent such a situation (when remembering that the UK is facing a particularly bad flu season alongside COVID which might exacerbate the need for grouping restrictions in households) the possibility of some local restrictions (that would avoid a wholesale revolt of Tory MPs in parliament) does remain fairly high. Examples from New Zealand, Singapore, Taiwan and plenty of other COVID success stories show that this virus demands a proactive response: something that the UK bureaucracy and this government in particular are genetically, systematically and conceptually ill equipped to deliver.  As such, slightly above a 2/3rds chance of some regional or local restrictions on social gathering by the end of the year, and with all that Q4 2021 is likely to bring, feels about right.

Furthermore, the number of cases seems to be stalling (weak evidence). Appearance of new variants is unlikely to change this, since delta seems to be mitigated by the vaccine as well, and variants take time to spread.  2/ The right criterion to think about this is the number of deaths. The number of cases peaked right around \"Freedom Day\", so it is unlikely to be used as a reason to reintroduce measures soon. In political terms, the government has taken a strong stance and it would be difficult to go back to containment measures.  The 2nd and 3rd lockdowns were triggered at a time were deaths were rising fast and at levels of 0.5 and 1 (per 100000) respectively.
