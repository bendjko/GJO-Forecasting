Certain Asian economies, notably South Korea and Indonesia, tried to protect their currency for sliding by buying currency with their foreign currency reserves. South Korea burnt through about 45% of their foreign currency between 1996-1997, roughly the same proportion required by Saudi Arabia to get to hit $50bn. http://www.theglobaleconomy.com/South-Korea/Reserves/. \nThis monumental forex burn was to protect their currency.

While this number has been falling over the past year (in Aug 2015, it was 113.0 billion), the pace of the fall appears be responding to changes in crude oil prices, since crude oil makes up 77 - 88% of Saudi's total income. That said, the recent stability of crude oil prices  could help to stabilise the macroeconomic outlook for Saudi Arabia. On the other hand, Saudi's central bank reserves have fallen dramatically in order to sustain the riyal, while its fiscal deficit appears to be unsustainable going forward. However, with interest rates low in advanced economies financial markets eager for yield, Saudi Arabia should be able to maintain its current reserves until 1 June 2017. This is of course under the assumptions that Saudi's government undertake structural reforms that signify clear to the financial markets that they are diversifying their economy through the relaxation of trade barriers and easing the cost of doing business.
