Currently, there are 5 candidate countries: North Macedonia, Albania, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey (https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/11/14/north-macedonia-wont-be-joining-anytime-soon-did-eu-lose-its-peak-leverage/). Montenegro and Serbia are already having their talks (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-balkans/french-change-of-tone-boosts-balkan-states-hopes-of-joining-eu-idUSKBN1ZZ1JY) and it is highly unlikely that Turkey will see any real progress given its actions in recent years. Thus, this is an all or nothing question. Their fates are intertwined. One of the biggest issues was France's hesitance with how the EU admits new states, an issue that was recently been addressed (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-balkans/french-change-of-tone-boosts-balkan-states-hopes-of-joining-eu-idUSKBN1ZZ1JY). While EU expansion of membership has always been a rather lower priority for the EU, these rule changes, as well as the inevitable fallout from Brexit, increases the likelihood of membership. This is because the EU will want to appear strong by increasing its membership and showing that it is still a savvy regional organization. Formerly known as Macedonia, North Macedonia has had a series of issues, including its original name. The original name was a point of major contention with Greece, an EU member, so last February, the name was changed. This name seems to be here to stay as one prominent politician was fired for merely using the old name (https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/europe/.premium-north-macedonia-s-first-jewish-minister-fired-after-using-country-s-old-name-1.8561541). It is clear that North Macedonia wants membership. The nation has also one praise for shifting toward solar energy by the EU (https://www.euractiv.com/section/enlargement/news/north-macedonia-wins-eu-praise-for-pioneering-coal-to-solar-shift/). Albania, meanwhile, is also very interested in joining the EU (https://atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/albania-still-committed-to-eu-membership-pm-says/). The corruption and crime reforms needed to win over France, the Netherlands and Denmark have been implemented and are seen as being effective (https://www.rferl.org/a/eu-s-enlargement-chief-very-encouraged-by-reforms-in-north-macedonia-albania/30441611.html). Albanian membership also seems less controversial as it does not have a naming issue. Since the Netherland and Denmark support Macron, winning over France, which is what has happened in recent weeks, is all Albania and North Macedonia needs to do (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-balkans/french-change-of-tone-boosts-balkan-states-hopes-of-joining-eu-idUSKBN1ZZ1JY). The two states also already use the EU for financial support through the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance, meaning that money is not an issue for their membership (https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_182).
