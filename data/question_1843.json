On February 25, he was specifically asked, \u201cIs the removal or departure of Maduro the US objective?\u201d Price responded, \u201cWe believe that Maduro is a dictator, that Maduro is corrupt, that Maduro is responsible for the suffering of his people.

The Biden regime is likely to continue the current strategy of sanctions, although they may attempt a more targeted application at individuals. Anthony Blinken, the new US Secretary of State, said, \u201cMaybe we need to look at how can we more effectively target the sanctions that we have, so that regime enablers really feel the pain\u201d (Khayan). Maduro has been in office since 2013, and holds the support of the country\u2019s military and supreme court (Wallenfeldt), and as of December 2020, the country\u2019s National Assembly (Angelo). He has worked to consolidate power, and is belligerent in the face of international scrutiny. Just last week, he expelled the \nEU Ambassador in response to new sanctions (Von Der Burchard). There seems to be no indication of an imminent change in US policy toward Venezuela and the Maduro regime. As such, I predict that Nicolas Maduro will not cease to be president of Venezuela before 1 April 2021.  There are factors that could dramatically change the circumstances, such as an internal revolution or a successful assassination of Maduro (he has been targeted in the past). I view these events as having almost no chance (ICD 203).

Various attempts to remove Maduro in recent years have failed, and Juan Guaido, political opposition to Maduro is losing support.  Maduro held on to presidential power following the country\u2019s last presidential election in 2018.  \u201cThe United States and more than 50 other nations have recognized opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3, president of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, as Venezuela's rightful head of state on the grounds that they believe Maduro rigged the 2018 election\u2026 [but] The Venezuelan military has ignored Guaid\u00f3's calls to mutiny and, despite some defections, continues to provide crucial support to Maduro. Anti-government protests have petered out\u201d (Otis 2018).  International sanctions have been placed on Venezuela for a number of years, meant to push Maduro out of office. \u201cAmerican sanctions designed to assist Mr. Guaid\u00f3 have gutted government revenues but also forced citizens to focus on daily survival, not political mobilization. His attempts to trigger a military uprising ended up consolidating Mr. Maduro\u2019s control of the armed forces\u201d (Kurmanaev & Jakes 2021).   Moreover, \u201cDespite the pressure, Maduro remains in power, backed by the Venezuelan military as well as key allies Cuba, Russia, China, Turkey and Iran\u201d (Aljazeera 2020).

In South America, Honduras has experienced the only successful coup since 1996 (Taylor, 2016). With the support of Russia, China, Turkey, Iran, and Cuba, Maduro is unlikely to lose power especially given the trend among his opposition to leave the country.  Aside from a 'black swan' event, Maduro will remain in power. \n\n  Aljazeera. (2020, November 9).

First is his widening grip over the Venezuelan government and his opposition\u2019s, Juan Guaido's, concurrent loss of power. Though the Venezuelan parliament was previously controlled by the opposition party, that changed in December when legislative elections resulted in the Unified Socialist Party (PSUV) winning in a landslide victory, with the PSUV coalition subsequently filling 256 out of 277 seats in parliament. Now it should be clarified that these elections were boycotted by the four main opposition parties and condemned by many domestic and foreign actors; nevertheless, it resulted in Guaido losing his standing as leader of the National Assembly in January 2021. Though Guaido had been recognized by over 50 countries as interim president since the disputed re-election of Maduro in 2018, the EU stated in January that it could no longer legally recognize Guaido as interim president since he lost his position as head of the National Assembly (despite the EU not recognizing the vote itself). He is still recognized as interim president by the US and the UK, but overall, the opposition continues to lose traction as their leading politicians flee and Maduro's party gains more control (however illegitimate it may be) over the government. Secondly, Maduro has shown that sanctions placed on him and his associates, such as the oil and financial sanctions imposed by the US, are futile in trying to oust him. The EU has recently imposed sanctions on 19 more Venezuelan officials and has called for political talks in Venezuela to set up new elections, but there is very little chance that this will have an effect on Maduro's power, at least in the short term. Maduro has further cemented himself as ruling leader, exemplified that foreign efforts to oust him are futile, squashed the opposition for the most part, and has shown no intentions of surrendering or stepping down, making it extremely unlikely that he will cease to be president before April 1st. The only scenario in which he would cease to be president is if he was assassinated or there was a coup, but given that Maduro has control over Venezuelan security forces and has thwarted several assassination attempts in the past, this looks extremely unlikely as well; however, it is possible, which is why I gave a 2% chance of \"yes.\" Overall, Maduro has managed to hold onto power for over seven years through strong opposition and international condemnation, and I, unfortunately, do not predict that changing within a month.

For external interference, the United States would be the most likely country to conduct such activity since they are the only superpower to endorse his exiled opposition, Juan Guaid\u00f3, while China and Russia back Maduro and the United Nations has resigned to accepting his authority over the country.  Over the last two years there have been at least three reports of violent attempts, either supported by the US government or involving US citizens, to remove Maduro from the presidency.  The most recent alleged attempt appears to have occurred in September 2020 when a U.S. citizen was arrested while possessing \u201ca grenade launcher, a submachine gun, suspected plastic explosive material and bundles of dollars\u201d to target oil refineries, although the United States has denied claims that this individual was working on their behalf.  President Donald Trump adopted hardline policies towards Venezuela, even insinuating the possibility of invasion, and while President Joe Biden was expected to change direction, he has maintained the same course to a lesser extent \u2013 opting for targeted sanctions and humanitarian assistance.  Since the Venezuelan military is also backing Maduro, it is highly unlikely an internal coup would find success within the next month.  While none of this is completely possible, I would think there is less than a one in ten chance of any further attempt being made to remove Maduro and less than a one in five chance of any such attempt being successful.  As a result, I find that there is a 1% chance Maduro is removed from office in the next 31 days only because I cannot go lower without saying it is impossible.

Guaido has called for a 'national consultation' to be held this coming Sunday. This will ask if citizens reject the election result and want a different government. In principle, in terms of the constitution, such a consultation is binding on the government. However, as Maduro now effectively controls all elements of government and the courts, it is highly improbable he will take any cognisance of the result of the national consultation unless it is in his favour. The EU, Brazil, US have all rejected the credibility of Sunday's election. External monitors were not allowed but with such a low turnout and with international and regions countries rejecting the process and result, one assumes it was not 'free and fair'.

I'll consider various scenarios, but so far none of them seem likely enough to be such an action-forcing event: Death from natural causes?\n-seems unlikely.  Maduro is only 58, looks robust and I see nothing obvious in the news to say that he is in ill health.  The COVID situation in Venezuela actually doesn't seem as bad as I would have expected: https://www.coronatracker.com/country/venezuela/  The health system is in a shambles, but for Maduro that doesn't matter -- if he caught COVID, he'd get top-notch care, or more likely, fly to someplace like Cuba and get treatment. Internal coup attempt, including ouster or assassination?\n--More likely than dying of natural causes, but still pretty low probability.  Maduro has already survived various coup attempts, including an attempted drone attack in 2018 that didn't work and a call by opposition leader Guaido to the military in April 2019 to rise up... which never materialized.  Those who are arrested in assassination plots get tortured in prison.  The regime  always seems to find out about the plan ahead of time and thwart it.  One of the benefits of running a police state with surveillance.\nOne caveat:  if it ever gets to the point where Maduro's cronies feel that they are not benefitting from his presence, then they might get rid of him.  But as long as they are benefitting materially from the regime's corruption, they have an interest in keeping him in power. External coup attempt?\nEven lower likelihood here, especially after the debacle in May 2020 in which independent US \"mercenaries\" tried to mount a coup attempt (for which they got 20 years in a VZ prison). Widespread public uprising?\n--Don't want to exclude the possiblity altogether since sometimes these can come \"out of nowhere\"-- remember Arab Spring--- but:  There were massive public protests in 2014, but that was 6 years ago, and the opposition can't get people out on the streets like they used to be able to do.  The Venezuelan people have endured years of Maduro and the manmade crises of his administration's graft and incompetence:  hunger, rolling electrical blackouts, gasoline price hikes, disease, etc.... if they haven't risen up before, don't see what would tip them over the edge now.  They would prefer to flee the country, as they have been doing. Opposition wins and forces Maduro out?\nAlso very unlikely.  The feckless opposition is more invested in fighting amongst themselves than in coming up with a viable plan that is an alternative to Maduro that the people can get behind.  Even if the opposition were united and effective, Maduro has completely rigged the system against them, so no election would be fair.  Speaking of which, the next presidential election isn't until 2024.  There is a parliamentary election scheduled Dec 6 2020, but the opposition is calling for a boycott because it's assumed it won't be fair.  So the results of the parliamentary election are going to cement Maduro's hold on power, not erode it.  https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20201102-maduro-looks-for-total-power-in-venezuela-legislative-election US/international pressure finally force Maduro to step down?\nAlso unlikely, given that US oil sanctions and other sanctions so far have not had the effect of getting him to leave office.  Maduro would only willlingly leave if there were a country willing to take him in exile. The only new situation that I can think of that might have an action-forcing effect is the fact that there's an incoming Biden administration.  That fact in and of itself is not enough to result in Maduro, say, stepping down.  But there is likely to be more US effort at diplomacy, as @Michael-Bennett noted. Biden's policy on Venezuela isn't yet crystal clear, so this would be one area to watch for events that could create action forcing events.\n"], [58028, "2020-11-27T17:02:18Z", [0.05], ""], [1624, "2020-11-27T02:29:28Z", [0.02], ""], [97100, "2020-11-26T19:19:54Z", [0.45], ""], [27710, "2020-11-26T14:40:02Z", [0.0], ""], [1056, "2020-11-26T01:21:14Z", [0.0], ""], [97021, "2020-11-25T18:43:28Z", [0.15], ""], [94791, "2020-11-25T10:14:53Z", [0.03], "US Senate appoints James Story as the ambassador to Venezuela.

With elections on the horizon in December for National Assembly, which are likely to be rigged, there seems to be little other than severe ill health or death that will remove Maduro from office. He clearly still retains support of the military, armed forces, police, coast guard etc. The economic plight of the country has led to the flight of many Venezuelans as migrants to other Latin American countries and the lure of the USA. Oil is Venezuela's primary income generator.

It's possible in the light of Biden's historic international and diplomatic experience. Many expat Venezuelans living in US and other parts of the word would be pleased to see that.
