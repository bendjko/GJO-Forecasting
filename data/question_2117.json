Summing up, I think there is consensus that bin2 is out, for four good reasons; \n1 As stipulated in the first sentence of the question, \"The outcome will be determined using data as provided by 91-DIVOC (91-DIVOC, parameters are set with the link)\"\n2 The dropdown menu below the chart states that the data we are seeing represents \"New cases 1-wk average\"\n3 Alongside the Y axis it says \"7-day average\"\n4 The data is in fact showing a 7-day rolling average (as confirmed by @Emking et al.)\nCase for defence rests. Prosecution claims that the labelling is not consistent on the pop-up for each day and can be misleading. \nSo it's either bin1 or bin3 for me. The next part is whether the spike which will appear on the 18th will be succeeded by a pronounced enough drop on the 19th to get back below 23.4. I have two trains of thought on this, but overall it looks like it will be very close.  Looking at 'New cases/Day' the reading on 10/13 is relatively high, and this will be the first day that counts in the final 7-day average. Usually, the day after the lumped post-weekend reading is lower than the remainder of the week, so I think the readings on 10/11 and 10/12 may be higher than preceding weeks due to the knock-on effect of the three zero-rated days. It's a slightly weak argument for expecting the reading tomorrow (10/18) to be something lower than 64/100k, and the following day to also be lower than on 10/13.  I'm assuming that the overall trend is declining, but flat for the purposes of this week, to play safe. A mid-point of the prior two Mondays is 55.4, and an equivalent Tuesday would be around 21. Lump this with the three days we already have readings for and we have 152.8 for the week.\nOn this basis the average should be close to 22.8/100k The other train of thought is that it is too tight to call and any reading higher than 60 tomorrow will very likely to push this into bin3. \nAnd that has only happened once since this question has been running ..."], [34959, "2021-10-17T13:39:31Z", [0.15, 0.0, 0.85, 0.0], ""], [95503, "2021-10-17T12:49:59Z", [0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0], ""], [101989, "2021-10-17T09:04:59Z", [0.01, 0.0, 0.99, 0.0], ""], [58028, "2021-10-17T07:13:03Z", [0.08, 0.0, 0.92, 0.0], ""], [79069, "2021-10-16T16:09:18Z", [0.4, 0.0, 0.6, 0.0], ""], [55987, "2021-10-16T15:32:30Z", [0.09, 0.0, 0.91, 0.0], ""], [99943, "2021-10-16T13:55:08Z", [0.7, 0.0, 0.3, 0.0], "Ok, I was at 100% on bin 3 for quite a while on this question.

(1) they are only at 62.5% of population fully vaccinated (younger population + a lot of folks not vaccinated) (2) Israel's prior spikes were late August September [and these things seem to be annual recurrence], (3) Israel was dealing with Delta for the first time. Delta has been dominant strain in US for awhile, seemingly is dropping already. In Massachusetts last year the winter climb started in October but didn't become exponential until December. Looking at the UK they hit peak end of July and still are below peak, even though it's climbed up from the trough too. https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&time=2020-03-01..latest&facet=none&pickerSort=asc&pickerMetric=location&Metric=Confirmed+cases&Interval=7-day+rolling+average&Relative+to+Population=true&Align+outbreaks=false&country=GBR~ISR~BEL~NLD"], [96678, "2021-09-08T18:20:43Z", [0.04, 0.3, 0.65, 0.01], "0.877 1 dose vaccination rate (12+)\n(.052*2+.057)/15*12 = 0.1288 pop share <12\n7.1M population (est.)\nleaving approx. 7.1*.01288 + (1-0.877)(1-0.01288)*7.1 = 0.953M unvaccinated residents or 13.4% All time cases are at 771k, assuming no correlation between vaccination status and prior infection for simplicity.\nApprox. 52k cases since delta, assume about half are in unvaccinated, so that leaves about 925k, then assume 13.4% of the remainder has had some form of covid & group with vaccinated (that's 124k) leaving about 800k with no immunity at all. Delta case rates have grown very slowly, around 4% daily. Likely they will continue to increase until some equilibrium point. I think we can simplify by assuming since vaccines are ~75% protective that ~25% of the vaccinated/prior covid population is susceptible, and adding the 800k with no vaccination or covid history gives 2.375M, less 52k cases leaves 2.325M susceptible. If cases increase at 4%/day until saturation, the rates (weekly) would look like\n2020\n2658\n3498 A continued linear increase would lead to a rate on 10/19 of around 100k cases/day. This intuitively seems unlikely but at the same time, the infected population at that point is still so much smaller than the available susceptible group that it's not completely ridiculous. Looking at this another way - Alabama has an unvaccinated population of around 2M and has had around 150k infected since delta started to spread; with an unvaccinated population of around 1M, I'd expect at least 75k infections in Massachusetts before rates start to decline, which in the above calculation would be reached at the end of September, leaving about 3 weeks of decline back to 27-28 cases/day. If the increase goes slower, then this point will be reached later, so the case rate on 10/19 would be higher than 28. So in either analysis, the case rate would very likely rise above 28.5 cases/day, and not fall below the 9/7 number of 24. On the other hand, there is some chance that behavior changes like mask mandates could lead to a decreased rate of spread, and some chance that the above analysis is totally wrong, which I'm assigning about a 5% error margin split evenly over the remaining options."], [102439, "2021-09-08T17:52:44Z", [0.57, 0.25, 0.11, 0.07], ""], [102486, "2021-09-08T17:37:14Z", [0.02, 0.48, 0.35, 0.15], ""], [88452, "2021-09-08T17:02:24Z", [0.0, 0.74, 0.26, 0.0], ""], [60695, "2021-09-08T16:53:08Z", [0.75, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [22689, "2021-09-08T16:19:41Z", [0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0], ""]]}
