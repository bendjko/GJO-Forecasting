The contours of the next Assembly of Experts are thus becoming clear weeks in advance of the polling\u2014and those contours are shaping for a conservative body likely to select a new supreme leader in a similar ideological mold as the incumbent. A reforming wave is not about to engulf the Islamic Republic. The Guardian Council disqualified a number of prominent clerics as part of its efforts to keep reformist-inclined candidates out. The most notable disqualification was that of Hojjat ol Eslam Hassan Khomeini, a grandson of former Supreme Leader Ruhollah Khomeini, who could have been a valuable and high-profile ally to President Hassan Rouhani. The Guardian Council also rejected several other prominent moderate candidates, including Mohammad Mousavi Bojnourdi, Khomeini\u2019s father-in-law; Majid Ansari, one of Rouhani\u2019s current vice-presidents; and Rasoul Montajab Nia, the deputy secretary general of the Reformist National Trust Party.  Hassan Khomeini is formally appealing his disqualification, although he has admitted that the Guardian Council is unlikely to reverse its decision.\nThe unexpected selection of Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, one of the regime\u2019s most bombastic and hardline clerics, to chair the Assembly of Experts is an indication of how conservative the body, which will select the next Supreme Leader, has become.  \nUltraconservative Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi was a surprise selection to become the new chair of the Assembly of Experts in a vote on March 10. The Assembly (at least technically) oversees Ayatollah Khamenei and will select the next Supreme Leader upon Khamenei\u2019s death.
