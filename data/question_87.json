The former French finance minister, regularly listed among the world's 10 most powerful women, used the annual World Economic Forum meeting in the Swiss Alps - an echo chamber for her policy prescriptions - to announce her candidacy and secure instant support from global movers and shakers. In a gesture of cross-Channel entente, British finance minister George Osborne formally nominated the centre-right Lagarde, 60, within minutes of the appointment process opening. Endorsements quickly followed from France, Germany and Italy, as well as unofficially from the United States, which holds a blocking minority of votes on the IMF's board. More significantly, China, South Korea and Mexico signalled in Davos they would support Lagarde, ensuring there would be no joint move by the big emerging economies to try to wrest the IMF job from European hands, which have held it since 1946. Whether out of diplomatic courtesy or lack of concern, no government has so far questioned whether she will be able to serve out a second term without being distracted by her legal troubles in France. ~~~ COMMENT: OK then."], [10039, "2016-01-24T18:37:08Z", [0.05, 0.9, 0.05], ""], [14331, "2016-01-24T16:01:41Z", [0.05, 0.8, 0.15], ""], [691, "2016-01-24T15:39:45Z", [0.03, 0.91, 0.06], ""], [16686, "2016-01-24T15:08:27Z", [0.08, 0.9, 0.02], ""], [3895, "2016-01-24T13:56:27Z", [0.01, 0.94, 0.05], "Lagarde looks pretty locked in."], [3363, "2016-01-24T13:08:45Z", [0.07, 0.72, 0.21], ""], [1800, "2016-01-24T09:44:59Z", [0.05, 0.8, 0.15], ""], [11080, "2016-01-24T09:36:59Z", [0.09, 0.85, 0.06], ""], [11885, "2016-01-24T08:50:34Z", [0.01, 0.96, 0.03], ""], [484, "2016-01-24T06:46:23Z", [0.02, 0.98, 0.0], "Ouija says almost a sure thing."], [15548, "2016-01-24T06:20:37Z", [0.05, 0.85, 0.1], "Updating my forecast, due to the strong support for Christine Lagarde."], [5001, "2016-01-24T04:00:25Z", [0.07, 0.8, 0.13], "Going slightly up again on @einsteinjs link: http://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/100746 Not going back to 90+ because not yet sure of the time frame for the trial.

(2) As she is still available for the job, the analysis should concentrate on her likeliness to be elected: As of 21/01/2016 the nomination process for her successor is open and will close on 11/02/2016. The board has announced that it will aim to find the next MD by 03/03/2016, leaving ample time before the end of CL\u2019s term on 05/07/2016. (3) Immediately on 21/01/2016, CL was officially nominated by the UK chancellor of the exchequer, George Osborne and on the same day received backing from Germany and France (French prime minister Manuel Valls said that the finance ministry would issue an official statement on 22/01/2016). (1) She also received backing from China, whose board representative, Jin Zhongxia, said: \u201cWe also support her to serve a second term,\u201d and \u201cChristine Lagarde has demonstrated outstanding leadership and strategic vision, as well as excellent professionalism and coordination skills,\u201d (4) Under CL\u2019s leadership, the IMF has added the Renminbi to the IMF SDR currency basket, after a prolonged campaign by the People\u2019s Republic. (1) (5) All of these countries appoint an exclusive director to the board of directors and on their own make up 18.20% of the votes. (6) In their selection process guidelines, the IMF specifies that the MD is appointed by a majority of the votes, while noting that the objective is an appointment by consensus. (7) In addition, US vice-president Joe Biden has also indicated support and was backed up by treasury secretary Jack Lew. (1) US support would put CL at 34.90% of votes. (6) However, the country refrained from a formal backing. (8) CL noted on 22/01/2015 that the US usually waits until the end of the nomination process before backing a specific candidate but also emphasized the support she had received from Biden and Lew. (2) While they do not appoint an exclusive board member, the following countries have also issued statements of support for CL:  Mexico - the country is this time not backing Agust\u00edn Carstens, its central bank governor, who is not in the running for this term. (9)\nThe Netherlands - finance minister, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, confirmed the country\u2019s support via Twitter. (8)\nSpain - Reuters reports that an official source in the economy ministry announced support for CL. (9) (10)\nFinland - at the WEF, finance minister Alexander Stubb announced that CL had the country\u2019s support. (9)\nKorea - in a television interview CL listed the country as a supporter of hers. (11) While these countries do not have an exclusive representative, they make up a substantial share in their respective groups: (6) Spain and Mexico have 63.14% of the voting power in the Latin America group, while the groups representative is also a Spanish economist. I will assume that the LA group will vote for CL with a probability of 80%. Finland only has a share of 15.62% in the Nordics group. The representative of the group is Norwegian. Assume conservative 45% probability of the executive voting for CL. The Netherlands have 31.63% of the votes in the Eastern European group. The group\u2019s representative is Dutch. Assume 60% probability of group voting for CL. Korea has 37.67% of the APAC group\u2019s votes. I will hence assume that the group votes for CL with a probability of 50%. During her term, CL has developed good relations with international leaders, DM and EM countries alike, mitigating the risk factor of opposition from non-core countries. During her tenure more voting power was shifted towards emerging markets. I will assume that she has a 40% probability of gaining the votes from the remaining countries. Hence, the votes she would receive (weighted by their respective probabilities) come to 59.60% (or 118.97% of the necessary majority). However, it will be imperative to adjust the probabilities as new information is released and to follow the remaining countries that have exclusive representation on the board of directors: Russia, Japan and Saudi Arabia. Possible Alternatives: As of now the only hint towards a possible rival is the rumour suggesting that Tidjane Thiam might be a likely competitor. However, I find it to be unsubstantial. TT took over as CEO of Credit Suisse less than one year ago (01/07/2015) and in addition has denied that he is in the running, saying: \"I think it's public that I'm a fan, I've been on the record, and really I've only had one career strategy always, is to try to do my current job well.\" He continued: \"I'm very focused on Credit Suisse and on delivering what I am committed to delivering at Credit Suisse,\" saying \"I have a big job to do, and I am doing to the best of my ability.\" (12) However, he could very well be a plausible candidate for the term after this. Coming to the question of whether, should CL be replaced, her successor will be European or not: As she is currently heavily favoured to be re-elected, this question is only relevant should CL drop out of the race (for example due to the legal case in France against her), should she lose momentum or should a stronger candidate emerge that gains support from countries currently backing her. To me the most likely case seems to be her withdrawing from the race (55%) followed by her losing momentum (40%). In this case, the countries backing her would need to look for a new candidate. Of these countries, roughly half are European, so I would put the probability of her successor being European at 50% (with American / African candidates being the most likely alternatives). The same goes for the emergence of a new candidate that would get the backing from her current supporters (5%). Probability of her successor being European = 50%. So in aggregate, this comes to a 50% probability of her successor being non-European. Notice: This is only an initial assessment, which needs to be updated after other candidates have been announced. However, unless a nomination is made publicly, IMF treats it the list of candidates as confidential and will only publish names after narrowing candidates down to a shortlist consisting of three candidates. (13) Assessment of probability: Based on the above analysis, I find a second term for CL as MD of the IMF (where would we be without acronyms) to be very likely. As noted above, with the currently assigned probabilities she has 59.60% of votes or 118.97% of the necessary majority. My detailed calculation table can be found here: www.nico-enders.com/forecasting/imfcl This leads me to start with an 80% probability of her being elected, while weighting the mentioned risk factors, that could lead to the converse scenario, at 20%. Of these 20% the probability of her successor being European is 50% i.e. 10% in absolute terms.

The International Monetary Fund said nominations for the five-year term to run the global crisis bank beginning in July will close on Feb 10. After a review of the candidates, the IMF executive board aims to have decided on a candidate by March 3. ~~ COMMENT: So, this IFP will be all wrapped up in 6 weeks (but I suspect that GJ *might* leave it open longer, especially if CL is picked to be the \"next\" MD, because the trial could theoretically explode and cause CL to back down...)

Here are two more links (with quotes!) from the WSJ and Reuters: WSJ - Jan 20 -- http://www.wsj.com/articles/imf-launches-selection-process-for-managing-director-1453333498 The expiration of Ms. Lagarde\u2019s current term in July had long been seen as a potential opportunity for emerging markets to challenge the seven-decade history of a European leading the emergency lender. But Ms. Lagarde\u2019s popularity among many of the fund\u2019s most powerful members\u2014including emerging markets\u2014and her signal last October that she is open to serving a second term is driving many fund watchers to call the selection all but over. \u201cBased on an exceptional record that she has built up and the trust she has earned amongst all constituent members from all part of the world, I really don\u2019t think she\u2019ll be challenged in any serious way,\u201d said Amar Bhattacharya, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Mr. Bhattacharya, a former director of the Group of 24, a bloc of developing countries formed to represent the interests of emerging-market economies, said Ms. Lagarde\u2019s perceived support for a second term would likely damp potential interest from other contenders for the post. \u201cShe is already very well established.\u201d Douglas Rediker, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and former U.S. representative to the IMF\u2019s executive board, said the former French finance minister\u2019s approach to the job gives her a strong chance of being reconfirmed. \u201cShe has been viewed as an independent voice at the helm of the fund, taking positions that have generally been seen as a very serious attempt to gain consensus broadly among the fund\u2019s membership, not just major countries,\u201d he said. A long-running legal case in France could be one potential snag for Ms. Lagarde. A French judicial commission has ordered the IMF chief to stand trial for alleged negligence over a decision she made as finance minister. Recent developments may have slightly elevated the risks the case potentially represents to her bid since she was appointed in 2011, though the issue didn\u2019t hinder her bid back then. ~~~ COMMENT: That last line seems worth repeating --> \"Recent developments may have slightly elevated the risks the case potentially represents to her bid since she was appointed in 2011, though the issue didn\u2019t hinder her bid back then.\" ~~~~ Reuters - Jan 20 --> http://www.reuters.com/article/us-imf-lagarde-idUSKCN0UY2ZN \"The Executive Board has adopted an open, merit-based, and transparent process for the selection of the managing director, similar to the one used in the previous round,\" Mozhin said in a statement. \"Individuals may be nominated by a Fund governor or executive director.

So far, no challengers have emerged for the top IMF job. One potential complication is that a French court in December ordered Lagarde to face trial for negligence over her role in a payout of some 400 million euros ($434 million) to businessman Bernard Tapie when she served as France's finance minister. Lagarde has vowed to appeal the trial order and has said she acted in the best interests of the French state and in full compliance with the law.

Jan 19: \"The IMF Needs More Lagarde\" --> http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/imf-lagarde-strong-leadership-by-ian-bremmer-2016-01 Christine Lagarde has said she is open to serving another five-year term as Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund. She should get it. The IMF has never had better leadership, and its board of directors should give her the chance to finish the work she has begun. When Lagarde took the helm in July 2011, she inherited an institution in crisis. The global financial meltdown in 2008 and its economic aftershocks had discredited Western-led multilateral lenders and the free-market \u201cWashington Consensus.\u201d Lagarde\u2019s leadership has helped to restore the Fund\u2019s reputation.\n[...]\nCritics will say that it\u2019s time for an IMF head who represents the developing world. Lagarde is, after all, the 11th consecutive European to hold the post, a privilege that has become hard to justify in today\u2019s world. Others will say that the failure to recognize the full effects of IMF-endorsed austerity on Greek citizens proves that she is out of touch with ordinary people. Still others will argue that the charges she faces in connection with a financial scandal in France will distract her from IMF business. After the ugly scandal surrounding Dominique Strauss-Kahn, her predecessor at the Fund, the Fund, critics will insist, can\u2019t afford such a distraction. Let\u2019s take these objections one at a time. The IMF (and the World Bank) should welcome leadership from beyond Europe and the United States. But the purpose of ending this Western privilege is to make the leadership selection process one that is based on merit, not political considerations. Lagarde is the best candidate for the job, and emerging powers like the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) have not united behind an alternative. The leadership of a European managing director probably facilitated the IMF\u2019s decision late last year to add China\u2019s renminbi to the basket of currencies underpinning its Special Drawing Rights. In addition, Lagarde displayed impressive political dexterity in finally persuading Republicans and Democrats in the US Congress to pass governance reforms that not only bolster the IMF\u2019s firepower to fight financial crises, but also more accurately reflect changing global economic dynamics. The BRIC countries, for example, are now among the IMF\u2019s top ten shareholders. On Greece, Lagarde made some characteristically blunt \u2013 some would say clumsy \u2013comments last year. But she is not near the top of the list of those responsible for the economic pain endured by Greeks, and her tenure at the IMF makes abundantly clear that no managing director in history has done more to lead the Fund in efforts to alleviate the suffering of people in crisis. Finally, the French charges against Lagarde were filed over the objection of the country\u2019s prosecutor-general, and her involvement in the case appears tangential at best. The world badly needs a leader dedicated to making the world a safer and more prosperous place. Lagarde has shown that she is such a leader, committed to making the IMF fit for the twenty-first century. She deserves the chance to finish what she started.\n~~~~ COMMENT: I wonder if this is the first (or one of the first?) in what will be a long line of support for keeping CL as MD."], [73, "2016-01-19T17:34:00Z", [0.05, 0.9, 0.05], ""], [12630, "2016-01-19T17:31:25Z", [0.03, 0.62, 0.35], ""], [15994, "2016-01-19T17:25:29Z", [0.04, 0.95, 0.01], ""], [522, "2016-01-19T17:09:02Z", [0.0, 0.55, 0.45], "If Christine Lagarde is not enabled to serve a second term then the pressure for a non European candidate will be large.

In October, U.K. finance minister George Osborne tweeted: \u201cDelighted to support Lagarde for another term as head of IMF. She is\u2014in both the English and French meaning of the word\u2014\u2018formidable.\u2019\u201d Many think Lagarde has helped keep the world economy on track in a very difficult period and steered the IMF toward a more activist approach to issues like gender equality, public health and the refugee crisis in the Middle East, Africa and Europe. If she wants a second term, they say, the world would be lucky to have her.\n. . . \n\"The court\u2019s ruling is not the only challenge to Lagarde securing a second-term.  Representatives from powerful emerging economies\u2014the so-called BRICS nations of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa\u2014say it is time one of their own led the fund. . . . \nEven in Europe, Lagarde\u2019s antagonists are growing in number. Greece and its allies have criticized the IMF\u2019s handling of that country\u2019s sovereign debt crisis, saying it should not have intervened and that its early recommendations were unduly harsh on ordinary Greek citizens. In a study released in 2013, the IMF admitted it had underestimated the effect its recommendations of austerity would have on the Greek economy. \"The emerging economies and Europe\u2019s increasingly popular leftists\u2014on December 20, the left-wing Podemos party finished third in the Spanish general election and could yet help for a coalition government\u2014portray Lagarde as a cloistered member of the European elite, concerned primarily with preserving the dominant capitalist system and bolstering the rich and powerful. \"Her supporters say this grossly misrepresents a woman who has used much of her time in office to help the dispossessed and disempowered through actions that are not strictly part of the IMF\u2019s mandate. It is disingenuous, they say, to argue that the managing director of the IMF should not do all she can to keep the global economy as stable as possible; capitalism is the dominant economic model in the world, her supporters say, and it is her job to make sure it works as well as it can. \"This argument will continue should Lagarde win a second term. If she doesn\u2019t, the fund has indicated that it will find a different sort of leader to replace her. David Lipton, the IMF\u2019s second-in-command, said in July 2015 that once Lagarde steps aside, her successor is likely to be a non-European and that the person\u2019s appointment will be \u201cstrictly merit-based.\u201d \"The charges against Lagarde relate to a financial scandal known in France as L\u2019Affaire Tapie. \n. . .\nLagarde\u2019s legal woes are not the first for a managing director of the fund. Fellow French national Dominique Strauss-Kahn was forced to resign in 2011 after a hotel maid in New York City alleged that he raped her. (Lawyers settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.) The director before Strauss-Kahn, the Spaniard Rodrigo Rato, was arrested in April 2015, seven years after leaving the fund, on charges of tax evasion and money-laundering with regards to his personal finances. His case is ongoing. \"The Tapie case has become a convenient tool for critics who say that Lagarde\u2014born into a well-to-do family . . . \u2014favors the wealthy and the privileged. Her tenure as finance minister in a politically conservative government is another mark against her for Europe\u2019s leftists. \"There is probably no population in Europe less fond of Lagarde than the Greeks. The IMF entered the Greek debt negotiations back in 2010 at the request of the Greek government and quickly became unpopular in the cash-strapped country. The initial bailout the fund suggested, which came with a package of pension cuts, wage freezes and tax increases, resulted in Greece losing a quarter of its aggregate income, said Domenico Lombardi, a former executive board member at the IMF. \"Lagarde defends the IMF\u2019s role in the crisis.  . . . . \u201cI don\u2019t think it would cross anyone\u2019s mind that in 2010 we should not have supported Greece and we should not have responded to their request to the IMF to have support.\u201d At the time, this request was met with horror among opposition politicians, among them the current left-wing Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who worried publicly that the IMF would implement harsh cost-cutting measures. \"When Lagarde took over as managing director, the IMF was already unpopular in Greece. . . .  Lagarde also insisted that Greece needed to make significant reforms to its labor and pension markets to reduce its high levels of debt. Though she has also advocated debt relief for Athens, many Greeks say they no longer trust her to represent their interests. \"Tsipras said in December that the IMF\u2019s position on fiscal and financial issues was \u201cunconstructive\u201d and that from now on Greece\u2019s bailout program should be handled by European countries and organizations only. Tsipras has made it clear that he wants Greece to handle its debt crisis; as the leader of a country that\u2019s part of the eurozone Tsipras cannot be rid of the European Commission or European Central Bank, but he can try to push the IMF out of the troika\u2014a term for the de facto alliance formed by the three groups in the crisis. \"A former Greek finance official, who asked to remain anonymous because he says he intends to publish his own account of the financial crisis, has few kind words for Lagarde. \u201cLagarde has two hats\u2014one is head of the IMF and one is that of a European politician who has not lost all ambition to return to the political scene in Paris, to run for president.\u201d In 2012, Lagarde laughed such suggestions off,  . . . That second hat, the official added, is at odds with her current position and causes her to advocate policies for Greece that favor Europe\u2019s big political players. \"Lagarde\u2019s friendship with the German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2014another figure of scorn for many Greeks for her role in the debt crisis\u2014further cements the impression among many Greeks that Lagarde is part of a Western European elite. (The pair regularly call and text each other about policy issues. Lagarde says she and Merkel also exchange small gifts from time to time. . . .  \"Lagarde\u2019s approach to the Greek crisis provoked some criticism from within the IMF as well. Paulo Nogueira Batista Jr., a former member of the IMF executive board who left in June 2015 to represent Brazil as vice president of the New Development Bank\u2014an organization that the BRICS nations operate as an alternative to the Western-led IMF and World Bank\u2014told Newsweek he felt conditions the IMF imposed on Greece were unduly harsh. . ..  \"But economists like Batista have another criticism of Lagarde\u2019s directorship\u2014and that criticism speaks directly to who she is rather than what she has done. \u201cShe is the 11th European in a row to run the IMF\u2014it is an outdated position to reserve the managing directorship for a European,\u201d Batista says. \u201cIf the IMF wants to be a 21st-century institution, it needs to have a truly merit-based system without this geographical preference. It cannot go on reserving the number one position for a European national.\u201d He says that a representative from one of the BRICS countries should lead the fund. \"Lagarde\u2019s critics know that they\u2019re probably outgunned. . . .  the U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, [is] one of her many powerful supporters. He spoke about her in glowing terms. \u201cShe can work through night after night and in the morning still approach both issues and people in a way that keeps them engaged and interested,\u201d he says. \"Not only does she have influential supporters in the United States and Europe\u2014the world\u2019s two biggest economies, if Europe is taken as a bloc\u2014but she has developed good relations with China.  \"To her critics, these moves are more examples of her comforting the comfortable. But her allies say she uses her power and influence in other ways. Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als, who serves as Lagarde\u2019s financial counselor and director of the monetary and capital markets department at the IMF, says his boss goes out of her way to promote young women and gender equality.\n. . . \n\"Lagarde has also involved the IMF in humanitarian crises in ways that are new to the institution. When the refugee crisis began, the IMF, which is not mandated to give aid, had to find more creative methods to help out in the crisis. In Jordan, for example, where the IMF already has a financial program to help and advise the government on economic policy, the fund, Lagarde says, \u201chas brought into the program much more flexibility to take into account the fact that [Jordan is] spending money on refugees, to take into account the fact that they have refugee camps and massive infrastructure drains on the economy.\u201d The IMF also relaxed Jordan\u2019s deadlines for its fiscal targets and adjusted other elements of the program such as financial disbursements. \" . . .  When the Ebola epidemic began in West Africa in 2014,. . .  Lagarde decided the fund should intervene. \u201cWe harnessed the goodwill in this institution, we put our thinking hats on and found all available trust funds that we had that could be re-engineered in order to address that situation,\u201d she says. \u201cWe were the first one to put cash in the banks so that [the governments of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone] could pay doctors, nurses and people in order to address the disease.\u201d\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  \n1)  I've read that the selection of the next managing director should be the result of a merit-based selection process.  . .  .BUT it sounds like anyone from inside Europe would could not have any \"merit\" according to those suggesting this.  \n2)  I've yet to read a single name of anyone who was more qualified or \"politically acceptable\".  The BRIC nations haven't been able to find/agree on a candidate.\n3)  She has the support of Germany, the US and France:  3 powerful nations.  \n4)  Who cares how much Greece dislikes her?  Right now, it seems that Tsipras and the Greek Financial Minister are not too highly regarded. The bottomline for me is that I am unaware of any candidate with strong credentials that has as much support as she."], [38, "2016-01-12T10:25:50Z", [0.24, 0.64, 0.12], "http://www.bbc.com/news/business-13452436 \"One of France's most popular right-wing politicians, in 2009 she came second in a poll carried out by broadcaster RTL and newspaper Le Parisien on the country's favourite personalities, beaten only by singer and actor Johnny Hallyday. \"But her popularity has stretched beyond French shores and she is viewed with high regard in the international arena. Well before she took the helm of the IMF, the Financial Times voted her in 2009 the best finance minister in Europe.  She won international respect for promoting France's negotiating clout in key forums such as the G20.  She also received plaudits for the key role she played in approving a bail-out mechanism to aid struggling members of the eurozone in May 2010. \"And her straight-talking manner has only added to her appeal.

Grouping the BRICS all together they accumulate for 7.4% voting rights. pro's and con's:\nCand. Lagarde: As per the many readings, a type of consensus seems that the \"french case\" against Lagarde seems key to lower her chances in the run up for the next term. The ones who will have a say in the vote look for other factors I suppose.  I have read in some of the comments, that her change of opinion/action in the \"Greek\" case, has angered some of the decision makers much more, respectively they will judge the leadership capacity of Lagarde or any other suitable candidate much more on showing the capability of coping with the foreseen and unforeseen financial global risks. cand. from other EU: \nany suitable existing or ex. Finance minster or from the EU body.  however so far none has exposed her/himself so far in the respect of, as a potential candidate. cand. from outside Europe. \nWho could be other pressure groups from outside the EU in order to support one of their own candidates? Foremost  the BRICS countries. I judge that currently they have their own problems and seemingly can't find a consensus candidate so far. A consensus candidate for m other developing countries, or the group of Asian countriesI cannot spot so far. In Summary I still jude the chances for Lagarde to be reelected again as far more positive, than any other one who needs to gather quite a number of countries supporting her/him.\nNext best chances I give to a European capable cand... rather than one from the USA, despite their overwhelming weight of voting rights. However, For the USA the candidate must be favorable, else no chance.  SO to a BRIC cand i give no chances foremost for this reason.\nA cand from USA is possibly also less likely not to fuel further the differences and heated discussions about the newly created Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, where the Chinese have the overwhelming voting rights with 30%, and the other BRICS a substantial share, and also the USA is completely missing as a founding member.

So a very conservative toward non-EU non Legard appointment is:\nLegard .6*.8=.48\nOther EU .4*.8=.32\nNon Eu .2 Now looking at the voting block of EU and US gives almost 50% of votes. Putting some others in there would practically boost that to majority. so the non EU chance is substantially lower (at best half). So updating:\n.54\n.48\n.10 In the European aspect I believe Legard has been well received so if she wants to stay on I would put her chances conditional on EU MD being virtually one (let's say .95). Her only real competitor would be Carney and his term is far from over and he has hinted at being open to a BoE renewal.

As finance minister, Ms Lagarde decided to refer the dispute to an arbitration panel in 2007 that ultimately awarded Mr Tapie more than \u20ac400 million ($607m) in compensation. This month a court ordered Mr Tapie to reimburse the sum. The ruling by the judicial commission of France\u2019s Cour de Justice de la R\u00e9publique--a court that decides on alleged wrongdoings by government ministers while in office--came as a surprise Thursday because prosecutors had recommended in September the investigation of Ms. Lagarde be dropped.

Here are a few excerpts. From the FT article: The IMF board was expected to meet on Thursday in Washington to be briefed on the latest developments, but one person close to the board said the most likely scenario was that it would issue a statement of support for Ms Lagarde. Board members have been told that any case would be unlikely to go to trial before next autumn, after Ms Lagarde\u2019s potential re-election to a second five-year term. Any trial, the board has been told before, would also probably be short with Ms Lagarde only required to attend one or two days.\n[...]\nAt the IMF she has won praise for her political judgment and for steering the fund through what has been a tricky period in its history stemming from its role in successive bailouts of Greece and a clamour by emerging economies such as China for greater influence. ~~~ From the Bloomberg article: Previously, Lagarde was seen as all but a lock to be reappointed as managing director when her term ends next July. At the fund\u2019s annual meeting in Lima in October, Lagarde said she\u2019d be open to serving another term. While she\u2019s still the front-runner and analysts said the case is unlikely to derail her reappointment, the prospect of a politically charged trial in her home country may still complicate her future at the Washington-based IMF.\n[...]\n\u201cShe hasn\u2019t made many enemies,\u201d said Truman, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. \u201cShe\u2019s curried a lot of favor.\u201d The case may proceed quickly, \u201cif only to remove the cloud of suspicion over her,\u201d said Christopher Mesnooh, a Paris-based lawyer at Field Fisher Waterhouse, who isn\u2019t involved in the Lagarde case. \u201cEveryone knows the importance of Christine Lagarde to the world economy. They won\u2019t want to leave this unresolved.\u201d ~~~~ COMMENT: Some important tidbits there. No enemies, support from the board, and a *probably* quick trial.

No doubt they would be interested in circumscribing such a court. Further, a \"negligence\" charge is so very hard to prove because there is, I would expect, an automatic presumption that the minister is doing their duty. Something similar to the corporate \"business judgement rule.\" So, here's a case that can be used to actually set precedent favorable to ministers in the future. The outcome, I expect, will be similar to that of how the U.S. Supreme court decided the \"honest services fraud\" cases on the positive side (requiring identification of a specific quid-pro-quo  kickback or bribe). Here, on the negligence side, they will probably require identification of a failure to perform a specific duty (rather than a more expansive \"violation of principle\" approach). The problem, of course, is that many wrongs are actually a complex of acts, each of which may be disassociated in time and type.

The FT article goes a bit deeper and talks about how Lagarde could make the jump back to French politics. Given the events in Paris, I suspect that the \"right-wing\" of France won't be making a resurgence as support will (likely) coalesce around the current President (unless it's spun very well by the Right). Past MDs of the IMF -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund#Managing_Director In looking at this list, I was surprised just how many past IMF MDs are French. Five (!) out of the 11 (or 12, if you count the interim). Of those 11 MDs, four had more than one term. The last to do so was 1987 through 2000 (Camdessus -- from France). This data point could be used to argue that there's going to only be one term for Lagarde or that it's been some time since there was a person with two terms. Interesting note, of the four that had more than one term, three (!) of them were French. Lastly -- http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/will-christine-lagarde-face-brics-challenge-as-imf-term-nears-end-1241508 -- \"Will Christine Lagarde Face BRICS Challenge as IMF Term Nears End?\" Nov 8, 2015 EXCERPT: As International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde's mandate enters the final stretch, emerging-market powers seem hesitant about teaming up to try to wrest the job away from Europeans. The IMF managing director has said she is \"open\" to seeking another term when her time is up in July 2016, while the so-called BRICS -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- seem divided about a power bid. (...) In 2011, the BRICS were unable to agree on a single candidate who would convey undeniable symbolic clout, leaving Mexico's Agustin Carstens to pursue a losing battle against Lagarde. It is an open question whether that would be different today. (...) Cracks have appeared within the 188-nation IMF itself. In July, the institution's number-two official, David Lipton, told the BBC that it was \"much more likely the next time around than it has ever been\" that the next IMF chief will be a non-European. (...) The prospect of a common BRICS candidate, however, faces a number of obstacles, according to experts interviewed by AFP. The choice of a candidate, for starters. A former IMF chief economist who currently heads India's central bank, Raghuram Rajan, has the ideal profile but he himself has torpedoed speculation. (...) Beyond the question of candidates, it would be tough to challenge Lagarde if she seeks another term because she has strong backing among the institution's members, including the emerging-market economies. \"Ms Lagarde has broad support among the IMF's membership,\" said economist Eswar Prasad, former head of the IMF's China division. \"She has taken a number of steps to make the IMF more sensitive to emerging markets' concerns and sought to increase their representation at senior levels of the IMF's management and staff.\" According to Shi Yinhong, a professor at Renmin University of China, the battle seems to have a foregone conclusion because of the composition of the IMF executive board, which names the managing director and which remains dominated by Europeans and Americans. \"Given Western countries' funding, their share of voting rights and their ability in and experience of managing international financial organizations, I believe the managing director candidate will still come from a developed country,\" he said. \\\\\\ COMMENT: This last article squares it for me.
